Later that same year, he was appointed as a curate in Hougs, a parish in the Diocese of Bergen. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway in 1857, representing the constituency of S√∏ndre Bergenhus Amt for two years. In the summer of 1858, he was appointed as \\"third priest\\" in the Trinity Church, a large congregation in Kristiania. In the fall of 1866, he became a curate (assistant priest) in the Church of Our Saviour, the main cathedral for the capital city of Norway. He was promoted to vicar there in 1872, and since that church was the cathedral for the diocese, he also held the title of dean of the Diocese of Kristiania. In February 1882, he was appointed to be the bishop of the Diocese of Kristianssand, based at the Kristiansand Cathedral. He was ordained as bishop on May 18th of that year. He held this post until his death on 17 April 1884. He is buried in the V√•r Frelsers gravlund cemetery in Oslo. Verdens Gang 6 December 1884.

It is also available in the Bahamas via Cable Bahamas. Surprisingly, however, ANT1 is not available through Cox Communications, the third-largest cable television provider in the United States. Previously, to receive the ANT1 Satellite broadcast through Dish Network, a separate satellite dish with a single-low-noise block downconverter was required to pick up the signal from EchoStar III at 61.5¬∞ west, or EchoStar V at 148¬∞ west. These were DISH's primary eastern arc international satellites. Nowadays, this setup is no longer required, and ANT1 Satellite can be received from Anik F3 at 118.75¬∞ west. ANT1 Satellite is available through the Greek Elite package, the Antenna Satellite package, and the MEGA package. ANT1 Satellite also broadcasts in Canada via an agreement with local Greek language broadcaster Odyssey Television Network. The full ANT1 Satellite programming lineup airs on Odyssey TV. The channel is also broadcast to Canadian audiences via satellite through Bell Satellite TV, with an almost identical setup as DISH Network. As with DISH, a separate dish to receive an international satellite is no longer required. ANT1 Satellite can be received through the standard Canadian Nimiq satellites. These similarities are mostly due to both DISH and Bell being so closely affiliated with EchoStar. However, it is difficult to view a properly-proportioned image on a high-definition television, being that the channel is broadcast in 576i PAL picture format with a 4:3 aspect ratio. Logos The first ANT1 logo was coloured with gold with ANT flattened 20 degrees to the right and the number 1 is bolded at size 2. At the left edges of the number 1, two lines starting from A to 1. The line at the top is short and the line at the bottom is long. The logo appeared at the top-left on the screen. Due to its brightness, the logo could cause burn- in on rear projection and plasma TVs. A defined image of the logo will appear permanently on the TV screen. On 17 September 2007, ANT1 launched the new pink logo which also included a new on-screen logo. The logo was more subtle and did not cause the problems mentioned above. On 15 September 2008, ANT1 dropped the pink branding and launched a new look and logo. The logo does not feature the lines above and below the word ANT1.

It is situated approximately east from the town of Louth. An Anglo-Saxon settlement dating from the 7th-century was discovered in the village after a local metal detectorist found a wide range of metal artefacts including twenty styli, coins, pins and trade weights and a lead tablet engraved with the female Anglo-Saxon name 'Cudberg'. An excavation by Dr Hugh Willmott from the archaeology department of Sheffield University found a 7th-century cemetery, timbered buildings as well as, high status ceramics and glass, as well as further ecclesiastical metal objects. Dr Hugh Willmott from the University said the finds suggest the settlement was a \\"high-status ecclesiastical and trading site and not an ordinary village\\". The church was dedicated to St Edith and was largely rebuilt in 1837. It was declared redundant by the Diocese of Lincoln in 1981 and closed. Despite it being Grade II listed in 1986, it was demolished in 1993. Excavation work and a survey were carried out during the demolition, during which a number of blocked doorways and windows were identified. Part of a late 10th-century or early 11th-century grave cover was used as rubble-fill in the south wall of the nave between the two main windows. Little Carlton had a windmill and watermill. The watermill was built in 1820 by J. Saunderson, engineer of Louth, for Joseph Bond. It last worked in 1847 and is Grade II listed. Most of the machinery is missing.

The content was variable: most focused on recording the ownership of estates and the descent of lordships of manors, thus the genealogies of county families, heraldry and other antiquarian material; In the introduction to one typical early work of this style, The Antiquities of Warwickshire published in 1656, the author William Dugdale writes:https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesofwar00dugd/page/n7/mode/2up Thus his work was designed primarily to be read by his fellow county gentry of Warwickshire, whose public lives and marriages were largely confined within their own county of residence, which they administered as Justices of the Peace and Sheriffs, and represented in Parliament. The genealogical and heraldic tradition continues with the series of Victoria County Histories commenced in the late 19th century. Other forms recorded archaeological sites. A closely related genre, which emerged in the second half of the 17th century, was the county \\"Natural History\\", which focused on the county's flora, fauna and natural phenomena, but which also often included chapters on antiquities. The best known examples were Robert Plot's two volumes on Oxfordshire (1677) and Staffordshire (1686); and John Aubrey's unpublished work on Wiltshire. Development =Continental models= Dugdale quotes as his foreign models C√©sar de Nostredame (1553-1629), historian of Provence in France, author of Rerum antiquarum et nobiliorum Provinciae, written c.1560, published 1615; Ottavio Rossi, historian of Brescia in Italy, author of Memorie Bresciane, Opera Historica, E Simbolica (1626); Guillaume Catel (1560-1626), historian of Languedoc in France, author of M√©moires sur l'histoire du Languedoc (1633); Samuel Guichenon (1607-1664), historian of Bresse in France, author of Histoire de la Bresse et du Bugey (1650) and Antonius Sanderus (1586-1664), historian of Flanders, author of Flandria Illustrata (1641). =English pioneers= William Lambarde's Perambulation of Kent (completed 1570; published 1576) is generally acknowledged as the first example of the genre in England. It was followed by Richard Carew's Survey of Cornwall (1602), and William Burton's Description of Leicester Shire (1622), as well as a number of other projects (such as those of Sir William Pole, Thomas Westcote, and Tristram Risdon in Devon, and Sampson Erdeswicke in Staffordshire) which, although they sometimes circulated in manuscript, did not come to completion or publication. Following the appearance of William Dugdale's Antiquities of Warwickshire (1656), a pattern was set. In the nineteenth century John Bowyer Nichols followed the line of a history of Leicestershire compiled by his father John Nichols, and saw numerous counties histories through the press at his printing firm. The scope of county histories varied, but the titles became quite standard: \\"Antiquities of\\", \\"Worthies of\\", \\"Geological survey\\", \\"Description of\\", later \\"Directory of\\", all could indicate the intention of producing a \\"history\\", a term that only in later times acquired the narrower meaning it carries today. Chorography, topography and toponymy might all be involved. Materials and collections for their counties were made by antiquaries, but publication might await sponsorship or enough subscriptions, as well as a capable author who would make a readable book, perhaps of multiple volumes, from notes.

It is housed in the Convent of San Domenico, Fiesole, central Italy. The background was repainted by Lorenzo di Credi in 1501. History The altarpiece is among the earliest known works by Fra Angelico. It was originally commissioned for the high altar in the convent's church, but was later moved to a side altar where it is currently visible. In 1501 Lorenzo di Credi repainted the background, which was probably gilded, with a more modern landscape featuring a throne with baldachin, trompe-l'oeil reliefs and two landscapes between pillars. The Gothic cusps were also eliminated in that occasion. Description The work is a Maest√†, a Madonna enthroned, a theme particularly fashionable in Florentine art at the time. The central group with the Madonna and Child is surrounded by eight adoring angels depicted in smaller size. The saints Thomas of Aquino, Barnabas, Dominic and Peter of Verona are at the sides: these were three saints of the Dominican Order (the same owning the convent) and the namesake of Barnaba degli Agli, a Florentine man who had donated 6,000 florins for the convent's restoration and enlargement. The naked Child is shown while grasping two flowers: a white rose, symbol of purity, and a red one, a forecast of his future passion connected with the Eucharist: the panel was in fact painted for the church's high altar, where the celebration of this sacrament occurs. The composition resembles that of Masaccio's San Giovenale Triptych (1422). The scheme is also similar to the cartoon of the Assumption by Lorenzo Ghiberti for the windows in the fa√ßade of Florence Cathedral (1404‚Äì1405). It is also one of the most ancient polyptychs in which the figures are in the same painted surface, without being divided into different compartments. Elements such as the less evolved perspective and the tile pavements (also found in an anonymous Florentine triptych from 1419 and an altarpiece by Angelico himself at San Gimignano) led to the datation of some three years before his San Pietro Martire Triptych, which is documented from 1428. The work had a predella, now at the National Gallery, London and portraying Adoration of Saints, Prophets and Members of the Dominican Order. The latter also houses a tondo with St. Romulus, perhaps located above the polyptych. The side pillars were decorated by ten small panels with saints and blessed, four of which are known today: two are at the Mus√©e Cond√© of Chantilly and two in private collections. 48px 141px 160px 138px 48px Predella of the Fiesole Altarpiece Sources Category:1420s paintings Category:Paintings by Fra Angelico Category:Paintings of the Madonna and Child Category:Collections of the National Gallery, London Category:Paintings in Tuscany Category:Angels in art Category:Altarpieces Category:Books in art Category:Paintings of Thomas Aquinas ","title":"Fiesole Altarpiece"},{"id":"31986986","text":"La Voz de Michoac√°n is one of the leading daily newspapers in Michoac√°n, Mexico.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 136. It is situated southeast from the market town of Louth, Lincolnshire. Great Carlton is listed in the 1086 Domesday Book as \\"Magna Carleton\\". The name Carlton derives from the Old English 'Ceorlatun' meaning \\"the village of the free peasants\\", from the word 'ceorl' meaning \\"free peasant\\". There was a market granted to Great Carlton in 1275. Great Carlton Village Hall The parish church is dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, and was largely rebuilt in 1861 by James Fowler in 13th-century style, although it retains its 15th-century Perpendicular tower. It is a Grade II listed building. A notable land owner and freeman of Great Carlton was George Smith, father of Captain John Smith (1580‚Äì1631); the same John Smith who acquired great fame as President of the Virginia Company at Jamestown in North America. John Smith was likely born in this village on his father's farm, but his parents (mother Alice Rickard) had to travel south to St. Helena's Parish Church in Willoughby by Alford for his infant baptism on Saturday, 9 Jan 1580. George leased other property from Lord Willoughby de Eresby. Alice Rickard Smith descended from the Rickards of Great Heck, South Yorkshire.Barbour, Philip L: The Three Worlds of Captain John Smith, pp. 3‚Äì4. Houghton Mifflin Company Boston, 1964.

He is regarded as being the founder of modern araneology in South Africa.  Early life and education  Collection of coleoptera (beetles) Purcell was born in London, England to Dr Walter P.J. Purcell of Waterford, Ireland, and his wife Sophia W.J. Hertzog of Cape Town. In 1868 the family moved to South Africa and settled in Cape Town. He spent most of his childhood on the farm Bergvliet, which was owned by his uncle W.F. Hertzog. From 1881, Purcell studied at South African College, Cape Town, matriculated through the University of the Cape of Good Hope (UCGH) in 1884 and received a BA (with Honours) in mathematics and natural science in 1887 from UCGH. In 1885 and 1887 he provided the South African Museum with samples of coleoptera obtained at Bergvliet and Prieska. Purcell continued his education in Germany with a focus on the internal structure of arachnids. In 1894 Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universitaet awarded him the degree DPhil with a thesis entitled \\"Ueber den Bau der Phalangidenaugen\\" (\\"On the structure of the eyes in the Phalangida\\"). Purcell returned to South Africa in 1895 and donated his collections of South African Coleoptera (Families Cicindelidae and Carabidae), and European Coleoptera and Rhynchota, to the South African Museum.  Career  Purcell applied for the position of director of the South African Museum in 1895 following the resignation of Roland Trimen but did not get the post. He took up an appointment as First Assistant at the South African Museum and keeper of the terrestrial invertebrates collection (excluding insects) in 1896, under its new Director, W.L. Sclater. He kept this position until 1905 when he retired owing to poor health. Solifugid He initiated the systematic study of South African scorpions, including the description of many new species. In 1899 he provided the first description of local Solifugae (Camel spider or Sun spider) and collected a large number of specimens. He was the first South African zoologist to start a systematic study of spiders, devising keys and providing full descriptions of species. Up to that time Arthur Stanley Hirst (1883‚Äì1930), Pickard-Cambridge and R. I. Pocock of the British Museum had occasionally named spiders sent to them from South African sources. Pocock especially was supplied with unknown specimens from Natal and Rhodesia, many coming from Selmar Schonland, the botany professor at Rhodes University. South Africa is a fertile hunting ground for the study of Mygalomorphae or 4-lunged spiders, and both Purcell and R. W. E. Tucker who succeeded him, were drawn to this group, as was J. Hewitt. William and Anna Purcell are an example of husband and wife collaboration in arachnology, the other well-known couple being George and Elizabeth Peckham from the States who worked on South African Salticidae. Purcell was the first zoologist in Africa to make a thorough study of Peripatus. He continued the work of H.N. Moseley, A. Sedgwick and others and described one new genus and three new species.  Eponymns  * In 1964, the genus of spiders Purcelliana was named after him by J.A.L. Cooke. * A species of South African gecko, Pachydactylus purcelli, is named after him. * Purcell was commemorated in the names of the molluscs Euonyma purcelli and Apera purcelli but these have subsequently been renamed. The standard author abbreviation Purcell is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a zoological name.

Some of his publications include: * 1902 \\"New South African trap-door spiders of the family Ctenizidae in the collection of the South African Museum\\" Trans. S. Afric. phil. Soc. 11 * 1902 \\"On the South African Theraphosidae or \\"Baviaan\\" spiders, in the collection of the South African Museum.\\" Trans. S. Afric.

S. Afric. phil. Soc. 15 p.115-173  Private life  On 24 March 1897, Purcell married Anna Cambier Faure, who was a close South African friend of Olive Schreiner. The Purcell's had three children, Frederick Walter Faure Purcell, Olive Margaretha Deneys Purcell and William Frederick Hertzog Purcell. Anna Purcell was a cousin of Barry Hertzog, and her sister Joey married a Smuts. During the South African War (1899-1902) Anna was involved in relief work for Boer women and children. She later became involved in the Cape Women‚Äôs Enfranchisement League, of which Schreiner was a high profile member. The Purcells lived on a country estate on the outskirts of Cape Town called Bergvliet. The farm was originally part of W.A. van der Stel's farm Groot Constantia. In 1905 Purcell retired from the South African Museum owing to ill health, although he continued some of his work as honorary keeper at the South African Museum up until 1908. He retired to Bergvliet where he managed the farm on behalf of his family until his death in 1919. He continued to collect specimens of arachnids and insects but his main activity was to create an Herbarium of the farm's natural vegetation. The herbarium is preserved in the Compton Herbarium at the National Botanical Institute in Cape Town. Purcell had a strong interest in Cape history, art and antiques and, with his and his wife's acquaintance with influential members of South African society, influenced the South African Museum in the purchase of the Koopmans-de Wet House, its conversion into a museum and his appointment as honorary curator.

It is housed in the National Museum of San Marco, Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy. History The work is Fra Angelico's first documented work. It comes from the convent of San Pietro Martire and a document from 30 March 1429 notes a sum of 20 florins owed to the convent of San Domenico, Fiesole, where the painter was a monk. According to some art historians, it could be contemporary of the Virgin and Child with Saint Anne (1424‚Äì1425) by Masaccio and Masolino da Panicale, although it lacks the use of compartments which at the time were widespread. Description In the center of the work is a Maest√† (Madonna Enthroned with Child) and, at the sides, are the Saints Dominic, John the Baptist, Peter of Verona, and Thomas Aquinas. In the cusps are lobed tondoes with the Annunciation Angel, the Annunciation and, in the center, Blessing Christ. Between the cusps are scenes of the life of St. Peter of Verona (Predication and Martyrdom). The Madonna sits on a brocaded seat, with the Child standing on her knees. She is holding an ampulla, a reference to Mary Magdalene's ampulla and thus to Jesus' passion. The Child wears a tunic with rich golden decoration. His hand holds a globe, a symbol of his power, while the other hands is raised in a blessing gesture. The relative lack of decoration, compared to Angelico's earlier Fiesole Altarpiece (1424‚Äì1425), which was still heavily based on Gentile da Fabriano's style, show the growing influence of Masaccio and a more realistic approach.

In Australia and New Zealand, an energy rating label or energy rating is a label affixed to various appliances prior to retail sale, which allows consumers to compare the energy efficiency of product and allows consumers to know how much power a particular model will use to run. They allow consumers to compare the energy consumption of similar products, and factor lifetime running cost into their purchasing decision.Labelling Overview 50px This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia licence. The energy rating label is a mandatory comparison label under Australian regulations for store sales but not for products sold online. The label comprises an energy consumption figure for the appliance and a star rating. The energy consumption figure is an estimate of how much energy (in kilowatt-hours or kWh) the appliance will use over a year, based on assumptions about ‚Äúaverage usage‚Äù. However, actual energy consumption will depend on how an appliance is used and how often it is used. Factors like climate can also influence energy consumption (and efficiency) for some appliances. The energy rating label usually incorporates an energy star label, which is an endorsement label that is not regulated by the Australian Government. It is an international standard for energy efficient consumer products that originated in the United States. Appliances and equipment that qualify to carry the energy star mark are generally in the top 25% most energy efficient products. In Australia, the label is used for office equipment and home electronics. New Zealand uses the energy star label for a much wider range of products such as whitegoods, lighting, heating, water heating and windows. History The label was introduced in 1986 in the Australian states of New South Wales and Victoria and later its use was extended to all states and territories. A mandatory, national labelling scheme was agreed to in 1992. Australia was the third country to establish such a system, after Canada and the United States. An International Energy Agency survey revealed that compliance by retailers showing the labels was raised from 94% in 2001 to 98% in 2009.

The three virtues have differently colored dresses: red for Charity, green for Hope and white for Faith; they are also depicted on the left while flying to heaven with sticks in their hands. Behind St. Francis, who wears his traditional brown monk habit, is his companion Fra' Leone. The scene is set in an idyllic landscape, between hills, castles and cultivated fields, without any attention to perspective and realism as in other Renaissance works.

It was built around 1360 by the monks of Nostell Priory near Wakefield and extended in the 15th century. The property went into a slow decline and by the 20th century was sub-divided and in an increasingly poor physical condition. Bought by the York Archaeological Trust in 1987, it was renamed Barley Hall and heavily restored in a controversial project to form a museum. It is open to the public and hosts exhibitions. History =14th ‚Äì 20th centuries= The earliest parts of the building were constructed by Thomas de Dereford, prior of Nostell Priory, around 1360. The priory was important in Yorkshire, and the monks used the building as a hospice, or townhouse when visiting the city. By the 1430s, however, the priory had fallen on hard times and the monks decided to rent the building out to raise additional revenue. Around this time there was new building work on the site, involving the poor-quality reconstruction of parts of the great hall. In the 1460s the building was rented to William Snawsell, a prominent local goldsmith, who paid 53 shillings and 4 pence for the property. This was a very high rent for the period. Snawsell was a supporter of Richard III during the troubled period of the Wars of the Roses and had given up the property by 1489. The priory was closed in the Dissolution of the Monasteries (1536-1541) and the later history of Barley Hall is less clear. By the 17th century the building had been divided into smaller units, with part of it turned into an alleyway.Historic Record , Barley Hall, the York Archaeological Trust, accessed 4 June 2011. The once internal corridor is a shortcut from Stonegate to Swinegate and is still a public right of way. By the Victorian era, the property had been subdivided into yet smaller units, partitioned by brick walls, and this pattern of use continued into the 20th century. By the 1970s, the property was used by a local plumber as a storage unit and showroom. =Late 20th ‚Äì 21st centuries= Barley Hall seen from the courtyard By the early 1980s, the building was in a dangerously unsafe condition and was scheduled for demolition to make way for offices and apartments.Society Members Form Group to Aid York's Hidden Ricardian Treasure , Ricardian Friends of Barley Hall, accessed 4 June 2011. As part of this process, however, the medieval architecture of the building was rediscovered in 1980; the site was sold for redevelopment in 1984 and then purchased by the York Archaeological Trust in 1987 when a further process of archaeological investigation began to inform a decision on the final use of the site.Society Members Form Group to Aid York's Hidden Ricardian Treasure , Ricardian Friends of Barley Hall, accessed 4 June 2011; Historic Record , Barley Hall, the York Archaeological Trust, accessed 4 June 2011. The decision on what to do with the building proved controversial.Holloway and Taylor, p.590. Its original wooden timbers had degraded significantly. Only 30% were still usable and the site had been extensively altered since the medieval period.Recreating Barley Hall , Barley Hall, the York Archaeological Trust, accessed 4 June 2011. The Trust decided to reconstruct the building as it might have appeared in 1483, with the intention of converting it into a museum, naming it Barley Hall after the Trust's chairman, Professor Maurice Barley. The post-medieval fabric of the building was largely destroyed and a new timber frame was built off-site and then moved into York over a ten-day period, a challenging operation due to the physical constraints of the immediate neighborhood.Gerrard, p.214; Barley Hall, Coffee Yard, York: Reconstruction of 14th century monastic hospice , McCurdy and Co. Ltd, accessed 4 June 2011. Replica furniture and fittings were created for the property, based on an inventory made in 1478. Supporters of the scheme, including English Heritage, viewed this as an attempt to produce an innovative way of presenting the past, similar to the Trust's work at the nearby Jorvik Viking Centre.Roskams and Whyman, p.15. The care and accuracy of the work was praised and the new museum received a generally positive public reaction.Holloway and Taylor, p.590; Gerrard, p.214. Critics of the reconstruction raised concerns over the nature of the preservation work.Gerrard, p.214. Academic Raphael Samuel noted that the restoration was heavily influenced by the late-20th century tradition of living history, in which \\"reinterpretation\\" gives way to \\"retrofitting\\", and where the past is \\"faked up to be more palatable than the here and now\\".Samuel, p.195. The chairman of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings critiqued the work as producing a replica, rather than a restored building, condemned the destruction of the later periods of the hall and noted that it was \\"another contribution to our Disneyland heritage\\". Historian Sarah Beckwith suggests that York is now so heavily \\"museumized that very few of its features escape the construction of an imaginary and commodified past\\", a problem she argues is typified by Barley Hall.Beckwith, p.14. Architecture The restored interior of Barley Hall On the ground floor, Barley Hall comprises several rooms.Welcome to Barley Hall leaflet , Barley Hall, York Archaeological Trust, accessed 5 June 2011. The storeroom, used as an admissions area, contains a large quantity of original 1360 woodwork, which leads onto a second storeroom, now called the Steward's room. At the heart of the building is the Great Hall, a 1430 construction, decorated on the basis of equivalents elsewhere in the city of York. The building also includes a pantry and a buttery. On the first floor is the parlour, which overlooks the hall, a gallery, and several bedchambers. Barley Hall is a grade II listed building.Barley Hall 2, York, British Listed Buildings, accessed 5 June 2010.

Vinnie first arrived on 25 November 2003, leaving the show on 23 February 2006. He made a return to the soap after a 5-year gap on 16 August 2011. The role was created specially for Magasiva and Vinnie is known for his party loving and easy going ways. His introduction saw a new group of young characters that formed a demographic for \\"hip, young things\\". Usually involved in comedic relief, Vinnie also participated in several melodramatic story lines such as the high-profile affair with his good friend Tama Hudson's (David Wikaira- Paul) girlfriend Shannon Te Ngaru (Amber Curreen). The storyline was named as a highlight of the 2004 season and cemented Vinnie's label as a \\"heart throb\\". Magasiva quit the role in 2006 and the character was written out when he accidentally impregnated tourist girlfriend ‚Äì Jemima Hampton (Liesha Ward Knox). Vinnie made his return in 2011 and in the intervening years, the characters family was introduced, making the soap's first ever Polynesian family unit. The character was well received and remains known as a heart throb, with Magasiva beating out his brother Robbie for \\"Hottest Male\\" in the TV Guide Best on the Box Awards 2012. Vinnie has also been named as one of the fans favourite characters and Magasiva, the favourite actor. Creation and casting Pua Magasiva had previously auditioned successfully for the guest role of Elvis Iosefa, the cousin of established character Louie in 1999. He appeared for several episodes however 4 years later, he was offered the full- time role of Vinnie Kruse, a core cast member. Vinnie made his first appearance in late 2003. The character was said to bring rebellion to the nurses and Magasiva hoped the character portrayed Pacific Islanders correctly, stating; \\"I wanted to make Vinnie very cultural, a character that Pacific Island people can relate to.\\" Magasiva soon decided to try his luck elsewhere and quit the role. The character departed in early 2006 and early reports suggested he was axed as part of a large cast overhaul at the time, however this was not the case. In reality, Magasiva's resignation brought on the large cast overhaul, which was an attempt by producers to represent a culturally proportional society after the exit of the shows only Pacific Islander. Magasiva soon regretted the decision, stating: \\"I took a risk and I left. The work didn't come.\\" Magasiva returned to the role after 5 years in August 2011. In 2015 Magasiva announced he would stay with the show, \\"as long as they'll have\\" him and expressed his desire for Vinnie to become the next Chris Warner (the show's longest running character). In late 2015 online rumours surfaced that Magasiva had left the show, though he denied this the following month. Following a series of controversial actions off-screen, Magasiva departed the soap opera in 2018. Storylines Judy Brownlee (Donogh Rees) hired Vinnie in late 2003 and he instantly got on the other nurses nerves with his party boy ways. In 2004, Vinnie started an affair with good friend Tama's (David Wikaira-Paul) girlfriend Shannon Te Ngaru (Amber Curreen). The two went public but Vinnie realised she loved Tama more and they broke up. Vinnie feel deeply in love with Tania Jeffries (Faye Smythe) but the presence of Mark Weston (Tim Foley) drove the two apart and Vinnie started to date Jemima Hampton (Liesha Ward Knox). Vinnie was promoted to charge nurse but the pressure proved too much and he resigned from nursing to become a paramedic. However, when he witnessed a murder scene,Vinnie returned to nursing. Jemima fell pregnant, scaring Vinnie and the two broke up. However, in 2006 the lure of being a father proved too much and Vinnie travelled to the United Kingdom to live with Jemima and his child. Vinnie returned to Shortland Street in August 2011 and quickly gained a job. He revealed to good friend Nicole (Sally Martin) that he had lost his son in a custody battle with Jemima and struggled to cope with the loss. Vinnie started to date Brooke Freeman (Beth Allen) but her manipulative ways drove him away and he briefly dated her sister Bree (Rachel Blampied) before she too, drove him away with her antagonistic personality. In November 2012, Vinnie began to date Emma Franklin (Amy Usherwood). The couple broke up following Vinnie having a drunken one night stand with Emma's friend, Kylie (Kerry-Lee Dewing). Vinnie scandalously began to date best friend, Nicole but following a fire at the hospital, he realised he was in love with Kylie and ended things with Nicole. He and Kylie were short lived however and Vinnie declared his love to Nicole to no success. However, after welcoming his son Michael (Duane Evans Jr.) permanently into his life, Nicole and Vinnie reconciled and she fell pregnant. Nicole had given birth on 11 December 2014 to a baby boy. As Vinnie looked up from his healthy child he was shocked to see Nicole was having a seizure. Vinnie was relieved that Nicole had survived although she was in a coma. One week later, Nicole woke up and was soon sent home. Leanne, Michael, Vinnie and Nicole were discussing what the name of their baby should be and they finally decided on the Samoan name Pele Vinnie's worries grew, as Nicole told him that she didn't love their own child any more. For Shortland Street's Easter special Vinnie realised he had lost his sense of humour, and wanted to prove to the nurses he was still funny, so he volunteered to be the bunny for the hospital children's Easter party. Later on at the picnic the kids tied him up and he tripped and fell into the paddle pool which nearly caused him to drown. Vinnie found this very humiliating so he declared that he will no longer be the funny guy, but it didn't last for long. Vinnie and Leanne start to worry more for Nicole when they start to think Nicole is developing schizophrenia like her brother, Eric. Vinnie believed Nicole that she didn't have schizophrenia which caused Nicole to realise how much she loves him. And not long later she proposed. In early September, 2015 Vinnie and Nicole finally got married. However, the marriage had been marred by infidelities, both marital, financial and at home. In September, 2016 Nicole and Vinnie became joint owners of the IV Bar. Drew's younger brother Cam McCaskil, the Head Chef of the IV was caught buying drugs on the property much to the horror of Nicole and Vinnie. In late 2016 she shared a kiss with new nurse Ruby Flores she confess to Vinnie after she then supports her Mum after her new husband pass away after falling off boat on their honeymoon. It led to her being away from Vinnie with her relationship strained. In 2017, Nicole was stood down from nursing because she had broken protocol under urgency to let Jack Hannah to help with a medical procedure well beyond their knowledge after the volcanic eruptions. She also fell out with Leanne because he never approved of Damo Johnson and Leanne re-entering relationship for the third time. On top of the money issues, on August 1, 2017, Pele was diagnosed with Type I Diabetes, and Michael, as the neglected child caught with the parent's fighting and tending to Pele, was led astray by Felix, Deb's son. Michael later left for Singapore with his birth mother. In 2018, Vinnie's latest investment plans failed again, and after they tried sharing the house and rent rooms, which included Zoe Carlson, who was later revealed to be Kate Hannah's sister, they decided to sell the house to Harper Whitley and Drew McCaskill, where they had to pay for repairs of plumbing after Leanne withheld information from them. On May 1, Nicole was hit by Finn's car as Finn and Esther was setting off to Detroit to further their careers. Nicole's conscious, but with broken femur, and suspected internal bleeding. After Finn admitted to drink-driving, his frustration had reached boiling point. He told Dr. Walsh, the doctor that wanted Finn to work in Detroit, about his DUI & accident. In May, Michael called from Singapore, saying that Jemima had suffered a stroke, so Vinnie had to go to Singapore to help her. After she recovered, he decided to stay in Singapore because he was offered a role as an F&B; department manager in one of the hotels that she manages. Although he tried many times to convince Nicole to fly Pele to Singapore to join him, Nicole suffered more panic attacks as the time draws close to her leaving, she rejected the offer for the final time, and Vinnie ended their marriage due to irreparable differences in values. Character development =Characterisation= Describing Vinnie, Magasiva stated: \\"Personality-wise we're a bit similar, very outgoing sort of characters. Even though he is always playing around, he does get serious at times ‚Äì especially with his work. He is serious about it and wants to do well. Apart from that he likes to have fun, he likes to tease people and dance around and just have fun.\\" His high energy led to him being popular with both staff and patients. Vinnie loved to party and was a hit with woman, even making moves on lesbian flatmate ‚Äì Maia Jeffries (Anna Jullienne). Magasiva hoped he could portray Vinnie so that he could embody the Polynesian population of New Zealand, stating: \\"He is very typical, but that's the way some of us are. We're being real people, I'm trying to be a real Samoan person, not trying to pretend to be someone else but just to be myself. And it shows when you see Vinnie, the way he talks ‚Äî Pacific Islanders are loud. You know where they are from a mile away. You get a whole bunch of people laughing, that's a whole bunch of Pacific Islanders.\\" In 2004 the character became part of a group of \\"hip, young things\\" alongside Tama Hudson (David Wikaira-Paul), Shannon Te Ngaru (Amber Curreen), Maia Jeffries, Norman Hanson (Jacob Tomuri) and Li Mei Chen (Li Ming Hu). The group embodied the \\"cool\\" and \\"groovy\\" demographic and were often found partying at their flat 'El Rancho' or the local bar. The group were described as: \\"witty, fun and spontaneous. They throw parties, play practical jokes, have complicated love lives, they stress about boy/girlfriends, best friends, what to do with their lives and what to wear to parties. What more could you want in a group of friends?\\" By the characters return in 2011, his cousin Maxwell Avia (Robbie Magasiva) had become the patriarch of a new family unit, cementing Vinnie in the middle and creating the soap's first ever Polynesian family unit in the 20-year history. Following Maxwell's departure in 2012, Vinnie was integrated into scenes and storylines within the family unit, effectively uniting him as the patriarch of the characters. =Affair with Shannon Te Ngaru= In 2004, Vinnie began an affair with the girlfriend of his good friend Tama Hudson (David Wikaira-Paul), Shannon Te Ngaru (Amber Curreen). The romance initially was hidden, however soon became public, a scene Wikaira-Paul enjoyed, \\"The most memorable thing for me this year was when Tama found out that Shannon was playing on him. I'd formed a huge bond with the character, so it was kind of personal. It surprised me how much I actually cared.\\" Magasiva described Shannon as Vinnie's first love but noted she had become preoccupied with Tama, \\"Shannon's the first eye opener, the first girl who's really caught his heart. He's really serious about her. There's nothing that will hold him back. He's so in love with her.\\" However, following the arrest of Tama's uncle Victor Kahu (Calvin Tuteao) and their checkered past together, Vinnie was suspicious as to whether Shannon loved him back. Curreen believed that Shannon was destined to love Tama not Vinnie, \\"Shannon wants Tama. She truly loves him, and now sees what a good thing they had. She feels terrible about herself ‚Äì she has lost everything good in her life.\\" The affair ended poorly for Vinnie, with Tama and Shannon marrying on Christmas Day 2004. =Relationship with Jemima Hampton= The arrival of Jemima Hampton (Liesha Ward Knox) in mid-2005 proved a new start for Vinnie who was struggling to withstand a relationship after his affair with Shannon Te Ngaru (Amber Cureen). Magasiva explained the attraction: \\"She's different. There is something about her that just excites him.\\" However Ward Knox was hesitant that the two would have any long standing relationship, stating: \\"Jemima lives in her own little version of the world. She is the kind or person that would walk into a supermarket, take a can of spaghetti from the bottom of a stack and walk away; when it all comes crashing down behind her, she'd just say 'Oh! It must have been the air conditioning!' She just really has no idea of the problems she causes.\\" Vinnie and Jemima ended up together only for Vinnie to discover Jemima was married. She ended up leaving Vinnie upset and alone. However Jemima returned in December 2005 and announced her pregnancy, with Vinnie the father. Vinnie ended up leaving Ferndale to live with Jemima and his unborn child in England. Offscreen the two settled in after the birth of their son ‚Äì Michael Kruse, but soon got into fights over Vinnie's party boy behaviour and when he missed Jemima's fathers birthday in 2011, she and Michael abandoned him. In 2014 Jemima returned to the show with her son and a storyline took place where Jemima began to redevelop her crush on Vinnie, Ward-Knox explained, \\"Jemima is dealing with a crumbling marriage, the prospect of being a solo mum again and Vinnie is a beacon of stability amongst the chaos ... Vinnie is willing to be so accommodating because he is one of the only people who truly understands her world and the way she operates within it.\\" =Relationship with Nicole Miller = When Vinnie Kruse arrived in 2011, Nicole made an embarrassing move on him but they forgot about it and became best friends. In 2013 Vinnie's and Nicole's feelings for each other increased but both of them were too shy to admit it.

History  248x248px It is assumed that Beylikd√ºz√º was first settled by Greeks from Byzantion in the second century AD as a farming village. It later became a popular resort for residents of Constantinople in the Byzantine Empire, a status that continued after the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire. The region was referred to as \\"Garden\\" in the later Ottoman period, and following the foundation of the Turkish Republic was called \\"Kavaklƒ±,\\" after the large number of poplar trees, a name which was used until 2003. The modern name means \\"Plains of the Beylik.\\" =Recent History= Beylikd√ºz√º is populated especially after the 1999 ƒ∞zmit earthquake by the people from older districts of Istanbul who preferred to move to newly constructed buildings in Beylikd√ºz√º because of their fear for safety of the old buildings. When the Metrobus (rapid bus system) is extended from Avcƒ±lar to Beylikd√ºz√º in 2012, Beylikd√ºz√º is affected by the second wave of migration. With the advance of Metrob√ºs the perception of \\"distance\\" has changed and places which seemed far away before became closer, so many moved to Beylikd√ºz√º. Its population has grown from around 3000 in the early 1990s to 350,000 by 2018.CHP‚Äôs candidate to use ‚Äòuniversal rhetoric‚Äô to appeal to Kurdish voters Since the population of Beylikd√ºz√º consists mostly of migrants from other districts of Istanbul or Turkey, and Beylikd√ºz√º is a relatively recently established city, Beylikd√ºz√º has gained a welcoming atmosphere for the newcomers without having any social stratification. The popularity of Beylikd√ºz√º has increased greatly in the last few years and the region became a hot spot for residential and commercial investments.http://www.turcomoney.com/istanbulun-yatirim-merkezi-olduk.html Beylikd√ºz√º has the highest rapid increase in the land and property value in Turkey, making its investors richer in a very short time.http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/istanbulda_emlagin_yildizi_beylikduzu-1105673 Beylikd√ºz√º was one of the few municipalities in Turkey that switched from AKP to CHP in 2014 with an overwhelming (>10%) vote.http://secim.haberler.com/beylikduzu-onceki-secimler/  General  248x248px Beylikd√ºz√º is the modern part of Istanbul which is improving more every day. Beylikd√ºzu together with the Atak√∂y Marina district are now attracting the upper-middle class because of their good infrastructure, and are seeing the construction of new luxury developments. The attraction is also increased by their close proximity to the Istanbul Atat√ºrk Airport. Beylikd√ºz√º is home to the most shopping malls in Istanbul and is considered a heaven for shopping, also referred to as the \\"AVM cumhuriyeti\\" (or republic of shopping in English). Beylikd√ºz√º is the one of the most cosmopolitan districts of Istanbul, thus hosting a mosaic of different cultures of Turkey together with people from other countries. Beylikd√ºz√º matches the European cities with its high green space per person. The green space is over 10M¬≤ per person in Beylikd√ºz√º. Almost in every street and avenue trees are planted at equal distance; making the whole neighborhood as an open-air museum. The construction of the botanical park in the huge valley between Adnan Kahveci and Cumhuriyet neighbourhood is still going on. Istanbul Seafood Wholesale Market Hall in Kumkapƒ± (in historical peninsula) is planned to be established in its new and bigger complex in Beylikd√ºz√º.http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/13250051.asp However, people with environmental awareness in Beylikd√ºz√º have a concern that the new seafood market which is planned to be constructed by land reclamation on the G√ºrpinar coast of Beylikd√ºz√º, can disturb the natural underwater current which cleans the B√ºy√ºk√ßekmece Bay. Environmentalist people fear that having stopped the currents the bay can turn into a sewage zone and lost all its beauty. Plus some experts claim that the seafood supply is mostly carried from the land not from the sea so it will add an unnecessary traffic pressure on the Beylikd√ºz√º's existing road system.http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/balik_hali__korfezi_bitirir_isyani-1134606 Neighbourhoods (\\"Mahalle\\" in Turkish) 248x248px * Adnan Kahveci * Barƒ±≈ü * B√ºy√ºk≈üehir * Cumhuriyet * Dereaƒüzƒ± * G√ºrpƒ±nar * Kavaklƒ± * Marmara * Sahil * Yakuplu Climate 435x435px 435x435px Annual average temperature of the sea water is 14.4 ¬∞C.

Since Beylikd√ºz√º is surrounded by trees the change of seasons in Beylikd√ºz√º offers a great visual show for its residents. Transportation Choices of public transportation are very rich for the area. Access to the region became easier with the extension of the Metrob√ºs line to Beylikd√ºz√º.

Biography Guilloux was born in Paris in 1866 and died in Lormes, Ni√®vre, in 1946. An employee of the Biblioth√®que Nationale in Paris, Guilloux was a self-taught artist who critics like Albert Aurier, F√©lix F√©n√©on, and R√©my de Gourmont liken to the time of the Symbolist movement. From 1891, his works were successfully received at the exhibitions of the Soci√©t√© des artistes ind√©pendants, and then at the \\"Impressionists and Symbolists\\" exhibitions at the gallery of Le Barc de Boutteville. Very soon, the titles of his paintings appear more elliptical, sometimes tinged with musical connotations (Scherzo Moon, 1894, location unknown), while the origin of his motifs becomes less and less identifiable. This structuring of space and the distribution of forms and colors on which Andr√© Mellerio (1862‚Äì1943) commented in his idealist movement in painting (1896), are found in many works painted by Guilloux: Moonrise over a Channel (Mills, Anne de Beaujeu Museum) or Landscape at Dusk (Beauvais, Mus√©e de l'Oise d√©partement). He exhibited at the Salon de la Soci√©t√© nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1905, and at the Salon des Ind√©pendants between 1911 and 1914.

The chemical agent has been linked to developmental problems with children as it affects hormones. The food affected includes beverages, fruit juices, bread, sports drinks, tea, and jam. After two years of investigations, the Taiwanese government levied NT$1.2 million (approx. US$40,000) in fines against 37 companies, or slightly more than US$1000 per company. = History = In mid May 2011, Taiwanese authorities reported that two Taiwanese companies Yu Shen Chemical Co. and Pin Han Perfumery Co. were using plasticizer DEHP in clouding agents the firms manufactured. This was used as a substitute for palm oil in clouding agents as a way to keep cost down and improve profits. However, Wei Te Chemical Co., a manufacturer of clouding agents, claims that \\"the reason most businesses tended to utilize illegal clouding agents was not because of price, but rather the long preservation periods and esthetically pleasing effect of using DEHP- laced products.\\"FOOD SCARE WIDENS: Tainted additives used for two decades: manufacturer, Taipei Times, 29 May 2011 Near the end of May 2011, the Taiwanese government had begun seizures of contaminated products and announced a ban from exporting. Later, the list for government safety checks was extended to syrups, tablets, pastries, and powders. By 27 May 2011, \\"up to 465,638 bottles of DEHP-tainted beverages have been pulled out from store shelves. Also, up to 270,822 boxes and 68,924 packs of powdered probiotics and 28,539 kilos of fruit juices, fruit jam, powder and syrup, and yoghurt powder have been removed from shelves\\", according to EcoWaste Coalition and a report from Taiwan's Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As of mid June, there are roughly 900 products which have been recalled from nearly 40,000 Taiwanese retailers. Some media reports, including in The Economist, conclude that Taiwan's former reputation as a reliable and safe food manufacturing country has been damaged. Taiwanese prosecutors alleges that one of the company Yu Shen at the centre of the crisis has used 5 tonne of DEHP every month to manufacture clouding agents which is supplied to food processing firms and pastry shops. There were 95 Taiwanese manufacturers which has used the DEHP ingredient. A further 244 ingredient manufacturing firms had also used the DEHP. = Reactions =  Domestic  Ma Ying-jeou has said that the government health units have launched the nation's largest-ever action to secure food safety by checking up to 16,000 food makers and outlets and removing from sales stands over 20,000 food and beverage items suspected of being contaminated with DEHP. Health officials have inspected over 14,000 food vendors and stores around the island, taking over 20,000 products off shelves. Ma has been criticized by the opposition DPP for his handling of the scandal. Opposition spokesperson Lin Yu-chang pushed the Ma Ying-jeou administration to come out with a new \\"D-Day\\" to combat the national plasticizer scare. The KMT criticized the DPP for their inability to detect DEHP while it was in power. They pointed out that DPP legislator Huang Sue-ying spoke against placing DEHP on the EPA's class-1 control list of toxic substances. KMT legislator Chiu Yi also alleged that the DPP had ties with the owner of the Yu Shen Company, Lai Chun-chieh. Lai's son also claimed on his Facebook that DEHP was not responsible for cancer, contrary to studies that show otherwise. International Chinese mainland authorities banned 812 products from the original list of 22 from Taiwan. This include sports drinks, tea, jam, juices, and other beverages. China later upgraded the banned list to cover 1004 products. In Hong Kong, authorities started monitoring its residents for contamination. They banned two types of Taiwanese sports beverage called Speed. Hong Kong's health secretary York Chow stated that because the ingestion of the carcinogen will be a health risk, he supported an outright ban of the DEHP agent. In neighboring Macau, health authorities found the antacid Scrat Suspension was tested positive for DIBP who later issued a notice of recall to local importers and pharmacies. Standard ChemÔºÜPharm had notified its retailers to pull the product off the shelves in Taiwan and Macau. Malaysian authorities found some bubble tea products were contaminated with DEHP and the importers were instructed to halt importation and ceased distribution of the products in Malaysia. Authorities in the Philippines banned DEHP affected products and carried out investigations of importers to ensure affected products were recalled. Vietnam and South Korea both banned affected Taiwanese products from importation. In the United States, California-based 99 Ranch Market, one of the largest Asian grocery chains in the country, removed plasticizer-contaminated beverages imported from Taiwan, off store shelves. 2013: Cooking oil adulteration and mislabeling In October 2013, a scandal broke out in Taiwan regarding the presence of chlorophyllin in cooking oil. Subsequent investigations unearthed widespread adulteration and mislabeling amongst cooking oil products sold in Taiwan. The resulting scandal affected many products, even outside cooking oil, such as health pills, alcoholic beverages, milk and rice. =Companies involved= Chang Chi Foodstuff Factory Co. Chang Chi Foodstuff Factory Co. () was found to have used copper chlorophyllin, an illegal coloring agent for cooking oil, in its olive oil and have adulterated its higher-end cooking oil with cheaper cottonseed oil. The company was fined NT$ 28.6 million in accordance to the Act Governing Food Sanitation after authorities have found that their products had been adulterated. In December 2013 company chairman Kao Chen-li was sentenced to sixteen years in prison for his role in the scandal. The company was also mandated to pay a further NT$50 million fine. A NT$1.85 billion fine levied by the Changhua County Public Health Bureau was annulled in July 2014 because Kao and two other company executives had already been jailed. Kao Tsung-hsien of the Ministry of Health and Welfare‚Äôs Administrative Appeal Committee stated: Flavor Full Food Inc. Flavor Full Food Inc. () was accused of blending cheaper cottonseed oil into more expensive cooking oils to increase their profit. On 26 October 2013, the company admitted of their wrongdoings through health officials. The company had adulterated 24 of its products sold in Taiwan with cheaper cottonseed oil, and also added flavoring agents to one of its peanut oil products. The company had been fined NT$ 8 million for 25 violations. The former chairman and his brother were each sentenced to sixteen months in prison and ordered to pay NT$25 million in September 2014. The company itself was ordered to pay a further NT$5 million fine. Formosa Oilseed Processing Co. Formosa Oilseed Processing Co. () was found to intentionally mislabel their six cooking oil mixtures as pure olive oils. The company general manager issued an apology saying that the company will stop selling the small-package olive oil. The company was fined NT$ 15 million. Geneherbs Biotechnology Co. The weight-loss pills manufactured by the Geneherbs Biotechnology Co. () were found to contain unauthorized drugs. The pills product called the Wellslim Plus+ contains cetilistat, a lipase inhibitor designed to treat obesity. Sing-Lin Foods Corporation In early November, sodium copper chlorophyllin was found on Wu Mu () steamed spinach ramen noodles brand manufactured by Sing-Lin Foods Corporation (). Taisun Enterprise Co. On 20 November 2013, the Food and Drug Administration of Ministry of Health and Welfare confirmed the grapeseed oil made by Taisun Enterprise Co. () contains the prohibited food additive copper chlorophyllin complex. Ta Lien Alcohol Company The contents of 11 out of 12 alcohol products manufactured by Ta lien Alcohol Company () were found not to match the ingredients listed on their labels as announced by the Department of Finance of Changhua County Government on 28 October 2013. The company was fined NT$ 5.5 million. Ting Hsin International Group The chairman of Ting Hsin International Group () was indicted in early November 2013 on fraud charges because of mislabeling products and violating the Act Governing Food Sanitation in connection to adulterated oil purchased from Chang Chi Foodstuff Factory Co. Wei Chuan Food Corp Wei Chuan Food Corp () were found to be involved in an adulterated cooking oil scandal. The chairman of the company offered a public apology during a press conference on 5 November 2013. =Reactions= Domestic responses ROC President ‚Äì On 23 October 2013, President Ma Ying-jeou pledged to strengthen inspection on food and beverage manufacturers and severely punish those with altered food products. He also ordered the Ministry of Health and Welfare to hold a national food safety conference in November 2013 to address the issues. Executive Yuan ‚Äì The Executive Yuan had announced that it is setting up a joint food safety inspection and control team between the yuan and Ministry of Health and Welfare and Council of Agriculture. ROC Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) ‚Äì On 23 October 2013, Minister Chiu Wen-ta said that he took full responsibility for cracking down the 'black-hearted' food suppliers. * Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ‚Äì On 29 October, Deputy Head Wu Hsiu-ying said that the MOHW had drafted law amendments to increase penalties for any food fraud. The maximum fines would be increased, while the minimum fines would remain the same. FDA is also seeking heavier criminal penalties for manufacturers of adulterated or counterfeit food by longer prison serving duration. Rewards will also be given to any whistle blower exposing food fraud within his/her company. * Deputy Minister Shiu Ming-neng held an interim press conference on 30 October 2013. There is a list of 37 cooking oil products in which he would ask the MOHW officials to go to those manufacturers and conduct investigation because of being suspected to contain fatty acid issues. The list consists of Taisun Enterprise Co. (), Ting Hsin International Group () and Taiwan Sugar Corporation (). ROC Minister of Economic Affairs (MOEA) ‚Äì Vice Minister Woody Duh said that the MOEA Industrial Development Bureau is reviewing the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) system and might require a manufacturer to present its export and import invoices and declarations and to allow on-the- spot inspection for its production line when it seek certification. He said that the MOEA will ensure that the GMP is a guarantee for safety, and without it consumers will be exposed more to unsafe foods. ROC Environmental Protection Administration ‚Äì Minister Stephen Shen said on 28 October that he would instruct local cleaning squads to accept and recycle oil bottles that still contain the adulterated oil. Democratic Progressive Party ‚Äì Former Chairman Shih Ming-teh said on 24 October 2013 that he and his friends would file a class-action lawsuit against Flavor Full Food Inc. to seek compensation over its adulterated oil products because his household's organic sesame oil was all from the company. Any compensation he receives from the lawsuit will be donated to charity organizations. International responses China In Mainland China, a food distributor in Fujian filed a lawsuit against Chang Chi Foodstuff Factory Co. to seek damages for compensation. Xiamen had ordered 40,000 liters of cooking oil made by Chang Chi Foodstuff Factory Co. to be removed from shelves and stepped up inspections on edible oil products purchased from Taiwan. Singapore Singaporean food suppliers that source from Taiwan cooking oil companies involved in the food scandal were ordered to hold their shipping by the Government of Singapore on 22 October 2013. United States In United States, stores removed all Taiwanese foods tainted by the chemicals and other questionable products off the shelves. 2014: Gutter oil incident The 2014 Taiwan food scandal refers to a series of food safety incidents in Taiwan that came to light in 2014. Adulteration of cooking oil with recycled waste oil and animal feed oil was discovered in September 2014. Despite coming to light only in 2014, mass food adulteration by Taiwanese food conglomerates, however, has been suppressed for decades, and the food safety crisis has been among the reasons for the electoral defeat of the Kuomintang in late 2014. At least 1,256 businesses were affected in the gutter oil scandal. =First case= The series of incidents first came to light on 4 September 2014, when it was discovered that tainted cooking oil was being produced by Kaohsiung-based company Chang Guann Co. () and branded as Chuan Tung Fragrant Lard Oil (). The company was found to have blended cooking oil with recycled oil, grease and leather cleaner. The recycled oil was processed by an unlicensed factory in Pingtung County owned by Kuo Lieh-cheng (), who allegedly purchased the oil from waste recycler Hu Hsin-te (), whose factory is named Shun Te Enterprises (), located in the Daliao District of Kaohsiung. Chang Guann purchased up to 243 tonnes of recycled waste oil disguised as lard from the Pingtung factory, starting in February 2014. The company then allegedly refined the waste oil before mixing it with processed lard and selling the tainted product to its distributors. The recycled waste oil was collected from restaurants, and included discarded animal parts, fat and skin. The President of Chang Guann Co. apologized to the public on 4 September 2014. He emphasized that his company was not aware and did not intentionally buy the tainted oil, and that the oil the company purchased from the illegal Pingtung factory was not cheaper than oil from other oil suppliers. On 11 September, reports revealed that in 2014, Chang Guann had also imported 87.72 tonnes of lard oil falsely listed for human consumption from Hong Kong-based Globalway Corp Ltd. (ÈáëÂØ∂ÈÅãË≤øÊòì) that were actually meant for animal use only. Since 2008, Chang Guann had imported 56 batches of lard oil weighing 2,385.1 tonnes from Hong Kong, about 300 tonnes of which were purchased from Globalway Corp between 2011 and 2014. The Taiwan Food Good Manufacturing Practice Development Association (TFGMPDA) reported that the cooking oil produced by Chang Guann has never been awarded GMP certification, although the TFGMPDA issued an apology saying that five food companies whose products have won GMP certification have used the tainted oil. Schools around Taiwan pulled all of the products containing the tainted oil from their school meals after 16 schools were discovered to be using the adulterated oil products. Chang Guann was found in violation of the Act Governing Food Safety and Sanitation and fined NT$50 million. Yeh Wen-hsiang (ËëâÊñáÁ••), chairman of Chang Guann, was arrested for fraud for his role in the scandal. The FDA began indefinitely halting imports of edible lard oil from Hong Kong on 11 September. On 1 October, prosecutors revealed that after viewing lab results, Kuo Lieh-cheng admitted that oil he sold to Chang Guann Co. was mixed with corpse oil, gutter oil, grease and leather cleaner, and recycled oil. On 3 October the Minister of Health and Welfare Chiu Wen-ta resigned in the aftermath of the scandal. =Second case= On 9 October, prosecutors launched an investigation into a unit of Ting Hsin International Group (È†ÇÊñ∞ÂúãÈöõÈõÜÂúò) over sale of alleged tainted cooking oil. Prosecutor Tsai Li-yi said Ting Hsin unit Cheng-I Food Co. (Ê≠£Áæ©ËÇ°‰ªΩÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏) is being investigated over allegedly mixing animal feed oil with cooking oil and then selling it for human consumption. Cheng-I Food Co. has an estimated 80 percent share of the lard and lard-based oil market in Taiwan. Wei Ying-chung (È≠èÊáâÂÖÖ), former chairman of three subsidiaries within Ting Hsin International Group and third of the four Wei brothers controlling the conglomerate, was previously indicted on charges of fraud as part of an investigation into the 2013 Taiwan food scandal. After the revelations, the Taiwan public boycotted Ting Hsin items, with a number of local governments, restaurants, traditional markets and schools refusing to consume the conglomerate's products. On 16 October, Ting Hsin announced that it will leave Taiwan's oil market and donate NT$3 billion toward food safety under the supervision of Ruentex Financial Group (ÊΩ§Ê≥∞ÈõÜÂúò) Chairman Samuel Yin.Ting Hsin leaving Taiwan oil market On 17 October, the Changhua District Court granted a request to detain Wei Ying-chung. On October 21, prosecutors said according to Ting Shin's Vietnamese oil supplier Dai Hanh Phuc, the majority of animal feed-grade oil imported by Ting Shin may be used in the China market. In response, consumers in China called for a united boycott against Ting Hsin products.China calls for Ting Hsin boycott In November 2014, Ting Hsin's products were tested for Agent Orange since an unnamed source told authorities that the oil Ting Hsin imported from Vietnam may contain traces of the herbicidal weapon.Ting Hsin oil allegedly contains Agent Orange The Kaohsiung District Court ruled that Cheng-I Food owed NT$9.36 million in damages. =Third case= On 3 November, prosecutors in Tainan took Lu Ching-hsieh, owner of Beei Hae Edible Co. and Hsieh Ching Corp. and his wife, Lu Huang Li-hua, into custody on suspicion of manufacturing cooking oil using substandard oil. Prosecutors said Hsieh Ching had bought animal feed- grade beef tallow and vegetable oil from Jin Hong, a trading company, and then allegedly mixed the ingredients together for sale as cooking oil. =Affected companies= According to Taiwan's Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a number of companies made food products using the tainted oil, including well- known brands such as Taiwan Sugar Corporation, Ve Wong Corp. (), Chi Mei Frozen Food Co. (), Sheng Hsiang Jen Foods Co. (), Gourmet Master Co. (), Yilin Group (), Hawdii Foods Co. (), etc. Restaurant chains, shops and stores were also affected, such as Good Morning (), Wu Wha Ma Dumpling Home (), Magie du Levain (), Yu Jen Jai (), Lee Hou Cake Store (), Black Bridge Foods (), Li Ji Cake Store (), etc. Wei-Chuan Food Corporation (), a subsidiary of Ting Hsin International Group which was previously cited with using adulterated cooking oil in 2013, was also involved in using tainted cooking oil produced by Chang Guann. Its share price plummeted after the company announced a recall of 12 products made from the recycled oil: canned pork, pork sauces, meat paste and pork floss. The company promised refunds to its customers. The recall announcement subsequently also brought down the share prices of other related food companies. =Reactions= Domestic * President Ma Ying- jeou made a public statement saying that the oil scandal happened due to lax inspection of food manufacturing factories by local governments, and he urged local municipalities to strengthen checks on those facilities. Democratic Progressive Party spokesman Huang Di-ying said President Ma should not shift the blame solely to the local governments since Chang Guann Co. has also allegedly imported over 2,400 tonnes of industrial-grade lard from Hong Kong over the last six years, with no foul play spotted by the central government. * Premier Jiang Yi-huah demanded the Legislative Yuan officials ensure food products containing the adulterated cooking oil be removed from store shelves and sealed. He also vowed to punish severely those who were involved in the making of the recycled oils, even though they met food safety standards. * Vice Premier Mao Chi-kuo described the selling of recycled oil by Chang Guann Co. as a vile criminal act and demanded the most severe penalties for the perpetrators. * The Ministry of Health and Welfare commissioned a group of experts to examine the health implications of consuming the illegal cooking oil. The FDA immediately released a list of 235 food companies around Taiwan that had reportedly purchased the tainted oil products. They also tested the tainted oil for any heavy metals, aflatoxin and benzopyrene, which may cause cancer in humans. However, they came out with a conclusion that products from the tainted oil do not pose any immediate health effects because 67% of the oil was still genuine, although the remaining adulterated materials require further examination. * Minister of Economic Affairs Woody Duh urged the Taiwanese food companies to increase their level of alert when obtaining materials for their products and to make onsite inspections at their suppliers' production facilities. The Industrial Development Bureau of the ministry plans to implement a full-scale monitoring system to trace the sources of raw materials and check the quality of all finished processed food products to prevent future similar incidents. * Investigators from the Ministry of Justice went through the bank accounts belonging to the companies and individuals involved in the tainted oil case to ensure all of their illegal gains were confiscated. * The Ministry of National Defense removed all food products that could contain the tainted oil from its military stores serving the armed forces. * The Criminal Investigation Bureau of the National Police Agency, accompanied by environmental and health officials, raided and swept the unlicensed Pingtung factory. Investigators found that the low-grade oil refined from food waste had been procured by several other companies and repackaged as lard oil to be sold to clients, and it was expected that at least around 200 tonnes of the oil had entered the market. * The Department of Health of Kaohsiung City Government fined Chang Guann Co. NT$50 million, the highest that can be imposed on violations under Article 15-1 of the Act Governing Food Safety and Sanitation (). The city's Economic Development Bureau also shut down Shun Te Enterprises after it was found to be unregistered. * Two separate protests occurred in front of the Executive Yuan, on 12 September and 17 October, demanding the resignations of Jiang and later Ma. International The General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine carefully examined the past records of the claimed- affected companies and restaurants. They also warned customers to be cautious of food products that may contain the tainted oil. Secretary for Food and Health Ko Wing-man said that the Hong Kong Government would check whether any food imported into the region had any tainted oil from Taiwan. The authorities would try to trace the buyers of the tainted oil. On 10 October, health authorities ordered a total ban on and the recall of all animal oils imported from Taiwan.Ban on Taiwan oils after fresh scare The Government of Macau was criticized because of lax inspection of food ingredient imports, although the authorities had earlier said that at least 21 local food manufacturers and retailers had been using oils supplied by Chang Guann Co. The Food and Drug Administration told businesses to pull questionable Taiwanese food products off shelves and said that the Philippines would accelerate signing a memorandum on cooperation with Taiwan on strengthening food safety checks. The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore conducted tests on suspicious food items imported from Taiwan. The incident also prompted some retailers in the country to seek clarification from their Taiwanese suppliers. Travel agencies also prevented Singaporeans from buying suspected tainted products in Taiwan. 2014: Methyl yellow in tofu In November 2014, it was found that dried tofu products (a.k.a. dougan Ë±Ü‰πæ) have been adulterated with an industrial dye, methyl yellow (a.k.a. dimethyl), for some 20 years. In December 2014, it was furthermore found that even regular non-dyed tofu has been found contaminated with carcinogens, resulting in over 25,000 kg recalled. Tofu and seasoning products from Taiwanese manufacturers have been found adulterated in the latest of a string of related scandals beginning in November 2014. The scandal was initially uncovered by Hong Kong authorities regarding the many flavored types of dried preserved tofu, that were recalled for toxic industrial dye methyl yellow contamination, after investigation it was confirmed that this adulteration had been going on undetected for over 20 years. A major supplier to 44 manufacturers, Chien Hsin Enterprises (ËääÈë´ÂØ¶Ê•≠Á§æ) of Tainan city was implicated as the origin. Despite the fact that methyl yellow can often be detected by color (bright yellow), a further scandal erupted in the following days regarding regular tofu (white or oil color if fried). Regular tofu products were also found to be contaminated with a carcinogen. At least 25,760 kg of deliberately contaminated emulsifier for tofu have been traced to the distributor. In the following days, ramen noodle seasoning packets were also found to be contaminated with methyl yellow, include some popular major ramen manufacturers previously implicated in the prior gutter oil scandals These products are exported worldwide, including United States, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Canada, Australia, Vietnam, Hong Kong, and China, in Western countries primarily on shelves of Asian food stores. As of Dec 18, these 73 products (in chinese) have been recalled related to methyl yellow contamination.

Balbay was arrested on March 5, 2009 as an Ergenekon suspect in the Odatv case, and in August 2009 he was sentenced to 34 years and eight months.  Journalistic career  Mustafa Balbay began his journalistic career in 1980 as a student reporter for a local newspaper called Gazete Izmir. The next year, he was hired by the centre-left daily Milliyet for their Izmir office and later he moved to Cumhuriyet's office in Izmir as a permanent correspondent. In 1985, he became the chief investigating reporter in Izmir for the same newspaper and in 1989 he moved to their headquarters in Ankara to work as the news director. In 1992, Balbay was appointed Cumhuriyet news director in Istanbul. In 1993, he was appointed as the main political correspondent in Ankara for the left-wing Kemalist daily newspaper Cumhuriyet. Later, he gave some lectures for the Faculty of Journalism of Gazi University. Up to 2009, he had also a political talk show called Ankara R√ºzgari (Winds from Ankara), co-chaired by the journalist Emin √á√∂la≈üan, on Avrasya TV (ART). After his arrest, he continued writing his regular column for Cumhuriyet.  Ergenekon case  Mustafa Balbay is detained as part of the government‚Äôs investigation into the alleged Ergenekon plot, that authorities claim was aimed at overthrowing the current Turkish government through a military coup. He was initially detained on July 1, 2008, brought to Istanbul, and questioned about his news coverage and his relations with the military and other Ergenekon suspects. Police searched his house and the Ankara office of Cumhuriyet, confiscating computers and documents. Released four days later, Balbay was detained a second time in March 2009 and placed at Silivri F Type Prison in Istanbul pending trial. He was moved to solitary confinement on February 28, 2011. His first trial appearance took place after nine months in detention. On February 25, 2011, the president of the Court, K√∂ksal ≈ûeng√ºn, officially opposed his detention, however, the court decided to keep him in detention with majority votes. From October 2012, he shared a cell with the arrested journalist Tuncay √ñzkan. = Legal charges = * being a member of an armed terrorist organization * attempting to overthrow the government * provoking an armed uprising * unlawfully obtaining, using, and destroying documents concerning government security * disseminating classified information. The evidence against Balbay consisted of documents seized from his property and office, the news stories he produced, wiretapped telephone conversations, and secretly recorded meetings with senior military and government officials. In its indictment, the government claimed that Balbay kept detailed records of his meetings with military and political figures with the intention of provoking a coup against the ruling AKP government. = Defense position = Mustafa Balbay has denied the government‚Äôs accusations. In columns written from prison and in court hearings, he has repeatedly said that the seized notes and recorded conversations related to his journalistic activities. Regarding the taped conversations, he said that such discussions were theoretical and constituted no criminal intent. Moreover, he added that notes shown as evidence and allegedly written by him have three different versions in the indictment. He also rejected claims that he has relations within the alleged Ergenekon organization. In a letter he sent to a delegation composed of Gazetecilere √ñzg√ºrl√ºk Platformu (Freedom for Journalists Platform), RSF, IFJ, EFJ and IPI he said, \\"if you try to produce a crime from an archive belonging to a journalist, you can declare everyone as guilty\\".

Description The work uses a scenic composition typical of the Danube school of the time. The subject, the birth of Mary, is shown in a secondary location of the lower part of the painting. It includes St. Anne's bed, the midwives with the daughter and St. Joachim riding a stair with something in his hand. The predominant part of the work is the church background, where angels fly to form a large circle: in the middle is a young angel with a thurible for the incense. The edifice, symbolizing the analogy between Mary and the Catholic church (a subject later abolished by the Protestant Reformation), is organized in a complicated and original fashion: the ambulatory and the column galleries are Romanesque, the ogival windows are Gothic, the vaults and the shell-shaped niches are in Renaissance style. This attention to architectural elements was typical of Altdorfer's work in the period he spent at the court of Maximilian I.

It was created by Harry Langton (10 November 1929 ‚Äì 6 September 2000), a sports journalist, after he took early retirement in 1972 from the Daily Express, a British newspaper, to launch Sports Design, a business publishing and selling sporting prints in London. With premises in Islington and the Camden Passage antique market on his doorstep, Langton soon ventured into dealing in old sporting prints, paintings and antiques. There was little market then for football, his own special interest, and over the last two decades of the century he gradually built up a vast quantity of football art and antiques illustrating the long, and global, history of the game. All codes were included. In 1981 an early display of this collection was viewed and praised by Sir Stanley Rous, the former Secretary of the Football Association, which encouraged further collecting with the idea of making it available to a wider public. Already it was attracting attention abroad. Some exhibits traveled to Germany for the opening of a Munich bank. Others appeared as black and white photographs at ‚ÄòFussball in der Vitrine‚Äô at the Galerie Littmann in Baumleingasse Basle in May 1982. In the spring of 1987 after many fruitless applications to municipal authorities for exhibition space, Sports Design presented ‚ÄòFootball Art ‚Äì the Langton Collection‚Äô at the Wingfield Sporting Gallery in south-west London. Serious recognition arrived when the Tyne and Wear Museums Service joined the Langton Collection with the ‚ÄòSoccer in Tyne and Wear 1879-1988 Exhibition‚Äô in Newcastle. This ran for two months before moving to Sunderland in January 1989. There it was viewed by an Italian promoter who proposed taking it to Italy for the 1990 Football World Cup. Transported to Rome it was ceremoniously opened at the Spazio Peroni by Silvio Berlusconi, one of whose companies, Gruppo Fininvest, was the major sponsor, and drew visitors throughout the tournament. The following year, to mark the 1991 Rugby World Cup, an exhibition of specifically rugby and old (pre soccer) football art and objects was hosted by the auctioneers Christie's at their South Kensington rooms. The Rugby Football Union later bought the specifically rugby items for the World Rugby Museum. The entire collection crossed the Atlantic in 1994 for the next World Cup. Organised by an American company, the SPI Group, it was displayed at Sotheby's in New York City. By this time problems of moving and preserving the large collection prompted an agreement with SPI that if a suitable buyer could be found it was for sale. Thus the Langton collection eventually became the FIFA Museum Collection in 1996. With support from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the efforts of Bryan Gray, the chairman of Preston North End F.C. it formed the major part of the National Football Museum, opened in Deepdale Preston in February 2001. After the sale of the main collection to FIFA, Langton continued to acquire works in his capacity as consultant. These pieces were designed to fill gaps and not to be comprehensive in themselves. Although Langton was closely involved with the Preston museum, he died in September 2000Fifa.com before it opened. In 2006, his widow, Ann Langton (9 September 1929 ‚Äì 12 February 2013), compiled a collection of poetry relating to football, called Saved, A Rare Anthology of Football from Homer to Gazza,Liverpool Museums} which was launched at the National Football Museum's Hall of Fame Awards in Liverpool. Financial problems led to a decision to relocate the National Football Museum to the Urbis building in Manchester, which reopened on 6 July 2012. After the death of Langton's widow Ann in February 2013, the Director of the National Football Museum, Kevin Moore, wrote to her family that: \\"Without Harry, supported by Ann, there would have been no FIFA Collection and therefore no National Football Museum, and therefore both we and the nation as a whole owe them both a great debt of gratitude.\\" In early 2016 the FIFA Museum Collection was renamed The FIFA-Langton collection by FIFA and NFM. This was in order to avoid confusion between the collection and those of the newly opened FIFA World Football Museum at Enge in Zurich and to better recognise the founding work by Harry Langton in football history and art appreciation.

The LLL was created by the initiative of Portuguese Army Colonels Jos√© Maria Moura and Carlos Frederico Lecor ‚Äì exiled in England after the occupation of Portugal by the Napoleonic Army ‚Äì and the Portuguese Ambassador in London Chevalier de Sousa, with the support of the British Government. The LLL received the title \\"Loyal\\" to distinguish itself from the much larger Portuguese Legion, mobilized at the same time with the best units and officers of the disbanded Portuguese Army by direct order of Napoleon and which would fight for him in the several European campaigns. The LLL included not only Portuguese, but also British (including its commanding officer, Colonel Robert Thomas Wilson) and Germans. The Legion was organized in Plymouth, in July 1808 and landed in Oporto, Portugal in September of the same year. Between 1808 and 1811, as part of the Anglo-Portuguese Army, the LLL fought against the Napoleonic Imperial Armies in the Peninsular War. It was present in the battles of Busaco(/Portugal,27.9.1810;ca 2000 men; commander: Friedrich v.Eben u.Brunnen, German,* 1773; source: O.Pusch, 1986) and Talavera de la Reina, but was especially used to conduct raids and other irregular operations in the rear of the French Army, framing Portuguese and Spanish militia forces. The LLL was disbanded on 4 May 1811, after being transferred to the Portuguese Army, with its units being transformed into the 7th, 8th and 9th battalions of ca√ßadores. Organization The Loyal Lusitanian Legion was organized as a regiment of light infantry, with an attached artillery battery. It included: # Regimental staff, LLL; # 1st Battalion, LLL; # 2nd Battalion, LLL; # Artillery corps, LLL. Each battalion included 1000 men in 10 companies. The artillery corps was a battery with six field guns and 80 men. When the LLL was disbanded, the 1st battalion became the 7th Ca√ßadores and the 2nd battalion the 8th Ca√ßadores. The 9th Ca√ßadores was organized with the rest of the Legion's men. Uniforms As a light infantry unit, the Loyal Lusitanian Legion received green uniforms similar to those of the British rifles regiments. Furthermore, green was the livery colour of the Portuguese Royal House of Braganza, to whom the Legion remained loyal.

He is notable for the many important buildings that his company constructed in Christchurch, of which his favourite was Christchurch Town Hall. His professional career spanned 80 years. Early life Luney was born in Lyttelton. His father was a carpenter who had immigrated from Canada. The family struggled financially and Luney attended several primary schools, including one in Canada for one year. He attended Christchurch Boys' High School for two years and was then apprenticed as a joiner. Two events in his early life shaped Luney. He was unjustly partly held responsible for the death of his younger brother, and it made him determined to care for his family. Missing Scout camp because his father could not afford the ten shillings made him value money and realise that it only came from effort. He saved carefully and persistently all his life and he hated unnecessary wastage. Family Luney met his wife to be in 1923 at the Christchurch Show. He employed her as office secretary and office manager and one of his intentions with that was to keep other men away from her. They married in 1930 and had four daughters. Professional career Luney founded his own firm, C S Luney Ltd, in 1926 with ¬£300 he saved up himself. The company has never had an overdraft facility, which possibly prevented it from going bankrupt during the Great Depression in the 1930s. In the early years the company's projects were mainly garages for the growing number of car owners in Christchurch. In 1930 the firm completed its first major project, the Radiant Hall (now known as the Repertory Theatre, a Category II heritage building), which had been financed by Thomas Edmonds, the manufacturer of Edmonds Baking Powder. The firm continued to grow and went on to build a number of prominent Christchurch buildings, many designed by Warren and Mahoney. Luney was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services in the 1983 New Year Honours, and a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to the building industry and the community, in the 1997 New Year Honours. Luney was still supervising construction work in his 90s. Miles Warren said of him that he was a \\"pressure-wave of energy\\" and he called him \\"one of the great characters of Christchurch\\". His favourite project was the Christchurch Town Hall, which was built between 1969 and 1972. For the construction of the Westpac Centre in Addington, he used \\"every piece of scaffolding available in the South Island\\", according to his biographer John Coley. Death and commemoration Luney died on 18 November 2006, aged 101. His wife, who had died before him in 2001, had said of him that he was \\"too busy to grow old\\". He was survived by their four daughters, twelve grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. During his lifetime Luney was chosen to be included in the Twelve Local Heroes sculpture on Worcester Boulevard in front of the Christchurch Arts Centre. \\"Charles Luney - Master Builder\\" directed by Samuel A. Miller. The Film, completed in Christchurch, New Zealand, includes interviews with C.S. Luney in 2003. The Earthquakes delayed production but the film has been released.

They are considered a delicacy and originated in the Tamsui District of New Taipei City. The dish consists of small eggs that have been repeatedly stewed in a mix of spices and air-dried. The resulting eggs are dark brown on the outside, chewy in texture, and very flavourful compared to standard boiled eggs. It has been said to taste \\"sweet, spicy and slightly salty with a concentrated egg flavour‚Äîa great snack with drinks\\". The eggs were supposed to have been created by the restaurateur Chang-nian Huang (ÈªÉÂºµÂìñ) serving snacks to the dock hands in the sea-side town. On one rainy day with less business than usual, Huang Zhangnian had to continually recook soy eggs (Êª∑Ëõã) to keep them warm after taking them out of the soy sauce broth. The recooking and drying process eventually resulted in shrunken eggs that were dark, flavourful, and chewy, which was extremely popular with the locals. Huang eventually founded a new business based on her iron egg recipe, selling them under the brand Apotiedan (). They can only be created by the use of \\"chicken, pigeon or quail eggs\\" but not from duck eggs. Quail eggs are very popular.

Star Slinger first came to attention after self-releasing a beat tape in the summer of 2010 entitled \\"Volume 1\\". Shortly after, Williams picked up noteworthy press interest from Pitchfork Media, SPIN Magazine, Dazed & Confused Magazine and was interviewed by Annie Mac on BBC Radio 1. He has collaborated with James Vincent McMorrow, Dawn Richard, Kilo Kish, Juicy J, Project Pat, Tunji Ige, Lil B, Sam Sparro, Stunnaman, Reggie B & Teki Latex alongside others. He has officially remixed for Jessie Ware, London Grammar, Duke Dumont, Childish Gambino, Ellie Goulding, Bipolar Sunshine, Hundred Waters (for Skrillex's OWSLA label) and was selected by ASAP Rocky to open all shows on his 2012 European Tour . He also co-wrote & produced Kilo Kish \\"Goldmine\\" which featured on the Sundance Film Festival Award winning film Dear White People. International club night and record label Star Slinger curates an international club night under the name Jet Jam along with visual artists Anze Sekelj & Michaela Selmani. The night's programming puts an emphasis on eclecticism and no emphasis on BPM. Artists to have played the party include Bondax, Shlohmo & Baths (musician). The JET JAM logo was designed by Michaela Selmani. In November 2012, Jet Jam released its first single in the form of Star Slinger \\"Ladies In The Back\\" (Feat.

P. Smith in 1908. They resemble members of Ctenizidae in morphology and behavior, but this is due to convergent evolution rather than direct relation. They are most closely related to members of Antrodiaetus, which build collar doors. It is likely that the shift from using collar doors to using trapdoors is what allowed them to survive in hot, dry conditions where their closest relatives could not. Often found in roadside banks or ravines, they build a burrow perpendicular to the surface with a wafer-like trapdoor entrance to catch prey. Burrows are often clustered together, sometimes quite densely in more favorable positions. They are native to the western United States, where the complex landscape creates pockets of isolated species limited to small regions. As one of the most abundant genera of trapdoor spiders in California, it is argued that their sedentary lifestyle and limited dispersal could benefit studies in the biogeography of California and the surrounding regions.

Subsequently, he served as clerk in county courts and transcribed several ancient books of records. In 1853 the governor of Massachusetts called the attention of the executive council to the perishing condition of the early records and recommended that the two oldest volumes of the general court records should be printed at the expense of the state. Ephraim M. Wright and Nathaniel B. Shurtleff were appointed to take charge of the printing, and Pulsifer, who was acknowledged to be especially skilful in deciphering the chirography of the 17th century, was charged with the copying. Pulsifer had previously copied the first volume for the American Antiquarian Society. Of his work, Samuel F.

It opened in 1931 to serve a dual purpose as an additional stage for the Royal Theatre and the first home of the new Danish Broadcasting Corporation. The colloquial name, which has now obtained official status, refers to the design of the stage tower in the shape of a box suspended above the street, and in the initial design proposals with a large round window high up as the dominating ornamental feature of the facade. History When the Danish Broadcasting Corporation was founded in 1925, it was based in very small premises on K√∏bmagergade. The first director of the new State Radio was the chamber singer Emil Holm and one of his ambitions was to establish a radio symphony orchestre in Copenhagen. In 1928 the State Radio relocated to rented rooms in the Axelborg building on Vesterbrogade, a former bank headquarters, but the need for more suitable facilities, with proper broadcasting studios and a concert hall, soon became evident. In the same time, the Royal Danish Theatre had been in need of more space ever since the inauguration of its new building in 1874, and in particular a venue which was better suited for the more Naturalistic plays. The past half century had seen a number of proposals for expansions and various existing buildings, such as the Dagmar Theatre, the Court Theatre and even Magasin du Nord, had been brought into play as a possible additional venue for the theatre. Architects such as Christian Hansen, Erik Bunch and Holger Jacobsen had published detailed proposals long before any competition was launched. In the end it was decided to combine the needs of the two national institutions and an architectural competition was held which was won by Holger Jacobsen. The location next to Old Stage As soon as the first renderings were published, the project was met with criticism and soon nicknamed St√¶rekassen (Starling Nest Box) due to its unusual design solution which at first included a large, round window high up on the facade toward Kongens Nytorv. The new building was inaugurated in 1931 but from the beginning failed to satisfy the demands of its two tenants. The theatre complained about the facilities for the audience and in the same time ceiling which separated the main auditorium from the combined radio studios and rehearsal rooms was inadequately sound isolated, making it impossible for the orchestre to practice under theatre performances. The Radio Orchestre therefore kept the premises in Axelborg for rehearsals and had to move all instruments back and forth for the weekly public concert in the Nest Box's main auditorium, but after two seasons the Royal Theatre terminated the contract As the Broadcasting Copporation grew up through the 30s, the need for more spacious and technically advanced premises arose once again and a new Radio Building was inaugurated in 1940 to the design of the Modernist architect Vilhelm Lauritzen although its concert hall was not completed until after World War II. By that time the Royal Theatre had moved into the Nest Box once again, using it as a venue for modern drama in accordance with the original plans. The Royal Theatre left St√¶rekassen in 2008, when the new Royal Danish Playhouse was inaugurated on the waterfront. Architecture and artwork The building consists of a high stage tower which spans Tordenskjoldsgade and connects Vilhelm Dahlerup's old theatre building from 1874 with a new corner building which the auditorium is found. The interior is richly decorated in Art D√©co style by the leading Danish artists of the period. =Facade reliefs= The facade reliefs on both sides of the stage tower are executed in Bronze and designed by Einar Utzon-Frank. The reliefs on the front towards Kongens Nytorv depict Apollo, God of musicians, flanked by the Muse of Tragedy, on his right hand side, and the Muse of comedy on his left hand side. On the opposite side of the tower, Mozart with violin, representing music, is seen flanked by Eros on the swan representing dance, and Shakespeare drama. = Passageway mosaick= The mosaic in the arched passage In the arched passage under the stage tower is decorated with a large mosaic by Ejnar Nielsen. It is composed of three million pieces of glass from mosaic factories in Venice. The world of the arts is represented by figures of Hans Christian Andersen, Carl Nielsen and others, whilst the world of radio is represented by physicist such as Hans Christian √òrsted and Niels Bohr. Today After the Royal Danish Theatre abandoned the building in 2008, it was handed over to the Palaces and Properties Agency which now rents it out for cultural event, or to companies, organisers, public institutions and other interested parties. The auditorium is best suited for theatre performances, concerts and small conferences. The foyer has service functions and toilet facilities and is mainly used for receptions.

Littig is on the Southern Pacific line, south of U.S. Highway 290. Littig is surrounded by blackland prairie soil, appropriate for growing cotton, maize and corn. An important creek, part of the watershed, meanders along the Southern Pacific right-of-way with numerous wooden trestles near Littig. History The townsite was laid out in 1883 on land donated by Jackson Morrow, a former slave. The original plat placed the train depot in the center of a one square mile area. The town was named for A. B. Littig, former general division agent of the Houston and Texas Central Railway, who surveyed the townsite, following the practice of naming new railroad towns after officers of the company. It had a railroad depot and locomotive water tank. A church and school were built in 1887 on land donated by J. W. Bitting. In 1889 a post office was established there with Thomas B. Fowler as postmaster. (The Houston and Texas Central Railway was succeeded by the Southern Pacific Transportation Company). By 1900 Littig had a general store, two cotton gins, three churches, and 168 residents. In 1907 the Littig common school district had three one-teacher schools for 185 black students and a one-teacher school for 33 white students. The population of Littig and many other small Texas communities such as nearby Kimbro, Manda and Lund began to decline during the 1930s due to advances in automobile transportation and mechanized agriculture; its population fell from an estimated 150 in 1936 to 35 by the 1940s. The Littig schools were consolidated with the Manda Common School District in 1952. The post office at Littig was discontinued in 1954, and mail for the community was sent via Elgin in Bastrop County. A church and several houses marked the community's location on topographic maps of the area in the 1980s. The population of Littig was reported as 37 from the late 1960s through 2000.

She was daughter of Ail√©an mac Ruaidhr√≠, and a leading member of Clann Ruaidhr√≠. Although Ail√©an had two sons, Lachlann and Ruaidhr√≠, both appear to have been illegitimate, whereas Christina was legitimate, and possibly a daughter of Ail√©an's wife, Isabella. A fourteenth-century source states that Christina assisted Robert I, King of Scotland during the First War of Scottish Independence, when he was a fugitive and hunted by the forces of Edward I, King of England. Another fourteenth-century source declares that, when Robert mounted a counter offensive following Edward II's demise, the Scottish king received critical assistance from an unnamed kinswoman, a woman who could be identical to Christina herself. Christina's support of the Bruce cause may have stemmed from her marriage to Donnchadh, a member of the comital kindred of Mar, a family closely related to the Bruces. It is also possible that Christina was influenced by her maternal ancestry, since there is reason to suspect that her mother was a sister of Robert's mother. Although Christina was the canonically legitimate heir of her father, it is likely that her brothers possessed control of their family's wide-ranging territories. According to an undated charter, Christina resigned her rights to Ruaidhr√≠ on the condition that her son possessed a stake in the inheritance. At some point following Ruaidhr√≠'s apparent demise in 1318, Christina attempted to transfer most of the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ lordship into the hands of Art√∫r Caimb√©al, in what may have been a marriage alliance with the Caimb√©alaigh (the Campbells). Despite this contract with Art√∫r, which may have had royal approval, it is apparent that Christina's nephew, Ruaidhr√≠'s son Raghnall Mac Ruaidhr√≠, was able to succeed as chief of Clann Ruaidhr√≠. The recorded royal forfeiture of a certain \\"\\" may refer to Raghnall, and could be evidence of him countering Christina's attempt to alienate the family lands. Further violent repercussions of Christina's contract with the Caimb√©alaigh may have been felt well into the next century, since James I, King of Scotland is recorded to have executed two chieftains who could have been continuing the feud. Family Christina was a daughter of Ail√©an mac Ruaidhr√≠. The latter was a son of Ruaidhr√≠ mac Raghnaill, Lord of Kintyre,Holton (2017) p. viii fig. 2; Petre (2014) p. 268 tab.; Fisher (2005) p. 86 fig. 5.2; Raven (2005b) fig. 13; Brown, M (2004) p. 77 tab. 4.1; Sellar (2000) p. 194 tab. ii; Roberts (1999) p. 99 fig. 5.2; McDonald (1997) p. 258 genealogical tree ii; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 279 tab. 1; Rixson (1982) p. 14 fig. 1. eponym of Clann Ruaidhr√≠.Holton (2017) pp. 126‚Äì127; Duffy (2007) p. 10; McDonald (2007) p. 110; McAndrew (2006) p. 66; Raven (2005a) p. 56; Raven (2005b) fig. 13; Murray, A (1998) p. 5.

If Christina was still a child at the time, it is possible that she was raised by Ingram. In February 1293, the Scottish parliament supported a claim of Ingram and Isabella concerning a grant of one hundred merks of land in tenancy (forty merks of which were located in the sheriffdom of Carrick). It was agreed that these rights‚Äîfrom the tocher of Isabella's marriage to Ail√©an‚Äîwere to be retained by the couple unless Ail√©an's heirs were able to recover them.Neville; Simpson (2012) p. 231 ¬ß 321; Findlater (2011) p. 69; McQueen (2004) p. 38; McQueen (2002) pp. 141‚Äì142; The Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland (1844) p. 447; RPS, 1293/2/15 (n.d.a); RPS, 1293/2/15 (n.d.b). The same year, the Scottish Crown created several new sheriffdoms in the western reaches of the realm. One of the new shrievalties was the sheriffdom of Skye, a jurisdiction that not only encompassed Clann Ruaidhr√≠ territories, but was placed under the authority of the Earl of Ross.Findlater (2011) p. 69; Rixson (2001) p. 92.

Although the former seized the throne (as Robert I) in March, the English Crown immediately struck back, defeating his forces in June. By September, Robert was a fugitive, and appears to have escaped into the Hebrides.Barrow, GWS (2008); McDonald (1997) pp. 170‚Äì174. According to the fourteenth-century Gesta Annalia II, Christina played an instrumental part in Robert's survival at this low point in his career, sheltering him along Scotland's western seaboard.Caldwell (2016) p. 360; Penman, M (2014) pp. 104, 359 n. 82; Caldwell (2012) p. 284; Young; Stead (2010) p. 92; Scott (2009) ch. 8 ¬∂ 46; Brown, M (2008) p. 19; Duncan (2007) pp. 19, 118 n. 725‚Äì62; Boardman, S (2006) pp. 49 n. 6, 55 n. 61; McDonald (2006) p. 79; Barrow, GWS (2005) p. 219; Brown, M (2004) p. 262; Duffy (2002) p. 60; Traquair (1998) p. 140; McDonald (1997) pp. 174, 189, 196; Goldstein (1991) p. 279 n. 32; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 283 n. 13; Reid (1984) pp. 293‚Äì294; Barrow, GWS (1973) pp. 380‚Äì381; Barnes; Barrow (1970) p. 47; Mackenzie (1909) p. 407 n. 133; Eyre-Todd (1907) p. 77 n. 1; Skene, WF (1872) p. 335 ch. 121; Skene, WF (1871) p. 343 ch. 121.

The fact that Christina is described as a widow in the record of her homage to Edward I‚Äîthe very day that Domhnall I's son Donnchadh is also recorded to have submitted to the king‚Äîcould be evidence that her husband had indeed been a son Uilleam.Jack (2016) p. 84 n. 219; Oram (2003) p. 64 n. 84; Bain (1884) p. 200 ¬ß 823; Instrumenta Publica (1834) p. 131; Document 6/2/0 (n.d.b). Later in 1307, at about the time of Edward I's death in July, Robert mounted a remarkable return to power by first consolidating control of Carrick.Barrow, GWS (2008); Barrow, GWS (2005) pp. 220‚Äì224; McDonald (1997) pp. 174‚Äì175. Christina may well have possessed further connections with the returning king. For example, there is reason to suspect that her mother was a member of the comital kindred of Carrick, and perhaps a sister of Robert's mother, Marjorie, Countess of Carrick.Beam (2012) p. 58 n. 23; Findlater (2011) pp. 69‚Äì71. According to the fourteenth-century Bruce, whilst Robert consolidated power in Carrick, he received provisions and military manpower from a woman described as a closely related kinswoman of his. The poem states that this unidentified woman lent the king forty men,McNamee (2012) ch. 5 ¬∂¬∂ 103‚Äì106; Findlater (2011) p. 70; Duncan (2007) pp. 196‚Äì199 bk. 5; Barrow, GWS (2005) pp. 220, 467 n. 26; Mackenzie (1909) pp. 81‚Äì82 bk. 5; Eyre-Todd (1907) pp. 77‚Äì78 bk. 5. a number which may correspond to the forty merks worth of lands assigned to Ingram and Isabella in Carrick.Findlater (2011) p. 70. Over two decades later, in 1328/1329, Robert is recorded to have provided an allowance of forty shillings to someone named Christian of Carrick.McNamee (2012) ch. 5 ¬∂ 103; Findlater (2011) p. 70; Duncan (2007) p. 196 n. 125‚Äì84; Mackenzie (1909) p. 407 n. 133. If Christina's mother was indeed a member of the Carrick kindred, and closely related to the Scottish king, Christina herself could well be identical to the kinswoman noted by the Bruce, and to the person who received the forty shilling allowance from the king. Ruaidhr√≠ and the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ succession The arms of the Earl of Mar depicted in the Balliol roll.Chesshyre; Woodcock; Grant et al. (1992) p. 382; McAndrew (2006) p. 137; The Balliol Roll (n.d.). Christina's husband, Donnchadh, was a member of the comital kindred of Mar, although his precise parentage is uncertain. Whilst the sources outlining with Christina's career suggest that she was a consistent supporter of the Bruce cause, those that outline the careers of her half-brothers suggest that they may have been more ambitious and opportunistic.McDonald (2006) p. 79; McDonald (1997) p. 190; Barrow, GWS (1973) pp. 381‚Äì382. Lachlann last appears on record in 1307/1308 in correspondence between William II, Earl of Ross and Edward II, King of England, in which the earl complained about Lachlann's audacity and rebelliousness.Holton (2017) p. 154; Cochran-Yu (2015) p. 73; Barrow, GWS (2005) pp. 228‚Äì229; McDonald (1997) p. 190; Reid (1984) pp. 300‚Äì301; Rixson (1982) pp. 18‚Äì19, 208 n. 10; Barrow, GWS (1973) p. 382; Bain (1888) pp. 382 ¬ß 1837, 400 ¬ß 14; Document 3/20/7 (n.d.). After this date, Ruaidhr√≠ appears to have succeeded Lachlann.Barrow, GWS (2005) p. 377; McDonald (1997) p. 191. Although Christina seems to have been the sole legitimate offspring of their father, it is unlikely that members of the kindred regarded canonically legitimate birth as the sole qualification of succession.Barrow, GWS (1973) p. 381. In fact, there was little distinction between legitimate and illegitimate offspring in Gaelic Scotland, as society tolerated temporary sexual unions amongst the elite as a means of furthering the continuation of the male line of the clan.Holton (2017) p. 154; MacDonald, IG (2013) p. 164; Dawson (2004) p. 29; MacQueen (1998) p. 288. As the leading male member of Clann Ruaidhr√≠ at this stage, it is probable that Ruaidhr√≠ himself possessed control of the kindred's wide-ranging territories.Ross (2012) p. 4; Raven (2005a) p. 63; Barrow, GWS (1988) pp. 290‚Äì291; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203. Nevertheless, Ruaidhr√≠ seems to have only gained formal recognition of his rights to the lordship after Christina's resignation of her own claims,Barrow, GWS (2005) pp. 377‚Äì378; Boardman, SI (2004). by way of a charter confirmed by Robert himself.MacDonald, IG (2013) p. 353; Ross (2012) p. 4; Boardman, S (2006) pp. 46, 54 n. 52, 55 n. 61; Ewan (2006); Raven (2005a) p. 63; Barrow, GWS (2005) pp. 377‚Äì378; Boardman, SI (2004); Brown, M (2004) p. 263; McDonald (2004) p. 190; Murray, A (1998) p. 5; McDonald (1997) p. 191; Duffy (1993) p. 207 n. 75; Duncan (1988) pp. 67‚Äì68; Easson (1986) pp. 21, 60, 133, 151; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 283 nn. 13‚Äì14; Rixson (1982) p. 27 fig. 2; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203; Macphail (1916) p. 235; Thomson, JM (1912) pp. 428‚Äì429 ¬ß 9; MacDonald; MacDonald (1896) pp. 495‚Äì496; Origines Parochiales Scotiae (1854) pp. 201, 363, 366; Robertson (1798) p. 2 ¬ß 53. There is reason to suspect that Christina's stake in the lordship‚Äîand her close connections with Robert‚Äîposed a potential threat to Ruaidhr√≠ and his descendants.Boardman, S (2006) pp. 45‚Äì46. Furthermore, Christina had a son, Ruaidhr√≠, who potentially could have sought royal assistance in pursuance of his mother's claims.Boardman, S (2006) p. 46. The name that Christina bestowed upon this son could indicate that he was not only named after his maternal grandfather, but that he was intended to be a potential successor to the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ lordship.Boardman, S (2006) p. 55 n. 61. Certainly, Christina resigned her claims with the condition that, if her brother died without a male heir, and her like-named son married one of her brother's daughters, Christina's son would secure the inheritance. Although this resignation charter is undated, it seems to have been granted early in the reign of Robert, possibly before the end of the first decade the century.Boardman, S (2006) p. 55 n. 61; Ewan (2006); Raven (2005a) p. 63; Murray, A (1998) p. 38 n. 10.

Warriors from the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ lordship may have also played a major part in Robert I's victory at Loudoun Hill.Caldwell (2016) p. 360. On one hand, it is possible that the king orchestrated Ruaidhr√≠'s succession to the lordship as a means of securing the continued support from Clann Ruaidhr√≠, one of the most powerful families on the western coast.Boardman, S (2006) p. 46; McDonald (1997) p. 191; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203. On the other hand, the fact that Christina‚Äîa close personal ally of Robert‚Äîhad been superseded by Ruaidhr√≠‚Äîa man with a comparatively chequered political career‚Äîcould indicate that the latter's consolidation of control more likely stemmed from internal family politics than from royal interference.Brown, M (2004) p. 263. Whilst the contract between Christina and Ruaidhr√≠ concerned the understanding that the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ lordship should remain (at least temporarily) in the possession of the male line of the kindred, it recognised Christina's rights to the heritage, and accepted the somewhat looser marriage customs in this region of the realm.Duncan (1988) p. 68. Whilst it is possible that the father of Christina's son was Donnchadh, the fact that the former is not specifically identified as Christina's heir could indicate that he himself was illegitimate. In any case, Ruaidhr√≠ was likely already regarded as the rightful chief, and the charter itself undeniably brought him under feudal dependence of the Scottish Crown.Barrow, GWS (1988) p. 291. Ruaidhr√≠'s provincial lordship encompassed the mainland territories of Moidart, Arisaig, Morar, and Knoydart; as well as the island territories of Rhum, Eigg, Barra, St Kilda, and Uist.Daniels (2013) p. 94; Boardman, SI (2004). This dominion, like the great lordships of Annandale and Galloway, was comparable to any of the kingdom's thirteen earldoms.McNamee (2012) ch. 1 ¬∂ 34. Nevertheless, it was during this period that several western kindreds‚Äîsuch as Clann Domhnaill and the Caimb√©alaigh (the Campbells)‚Äîwere richly rewarded for their service to the Bruce cause with extensive grants of lands carved out of former Clann Dubhghaill territories forfeited by the king. The evidence of internal discord within Clann Ruaidhr√≠ could account for the fact that the family failed to make similar gains in the wake of Clann Dubhghaill's downfall. Raghnall and the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ succession The seal of Alasdair √ìg Mac Domhnaill.McAndrew (2006) p. 67; McDonald (1995) p. 132; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 281 n. 5; Rixson (1982) pp. 128, 219 n. 2; Macdonald, WR (1904) p. 227 ¬ß 1793; MacDonald; MacDonald (1896) pp. 88‚Äì89; Laing (1866) p. 91 ¬ß 536. The device shows a manned galley.Rixson (1982) p. 128. Christina's resignations to Ruaidhr√≠ Mac Ruaidhr√≠ and Art√∫r Caimb√©al stipulated that the men owed the Scottish Crown the service of an armed ship. Such conditions exemplify the importance placed upon sea power at the time. Ruaidhr√≠ appears to be identical to the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ dynast‚Äîstyled \\"King of the Hebrides\\"‚Äîwho lost his life in the service of the Bruce campaign in Ireland in 1318.Hill (2014) p. 219; Daniels (2013) p. 94; Boardman, S (2006) pp. 45‚Äì46; Annals of Loch C√© (2008) ¬ß 1318.7; Annala Uladh (2005) ¬ß 1315.5; Annals of Loch C√© (2005) ¬ß 1318.7; Barrow, GWS (2005) p. 488 n. 104; Brown, M (2004) p. 265; Boardman, SI (2004); Caldwell (2004) p. 72; Annala Uladh (2003) ¬ß 1315.5; Duffy (2002) pp. 61, 194 n. 64; Roberts (1999) pp. 144, 181; Bannerman (1998) p. 25; Murray, A (1998) pp. 5‚Äì6; McDonald (1997) p. 191; Duffy (1993) pp. 206‚Äì207; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203; Murphy (1896) p. 281; AU, 1315 (n.d.). Although Ruaidhr√≠ seems to have ensured the continuation of his kindred by formally coming to terms with Robert and campaigning in Ireland with the latter's brother, there is evidence indicating that the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ inheritance was contested by Christina after his demise.Boardman, S (2006) p. 46; Boardman, SI (2004). At the time of his death, Ruaidhr√≠'s son, Raghnall, may well have been under age, and it is apparent that Christina and her confederates again attempted to seize control of the inheritance.Boardman, S (2006) pp. 45‚Äì47; Ewan (2006); Proctor (2006). Although she is recorded to have resigned her claimed rights to a certain Art√∫r Caimb√©al at some point after Ruaidhr√≠'s death,Penman, M (2014) p. 260; Duncan (2007) p. 118 n. 153; Boardman, S (2006) pp. 46‚Äì47; Boardman, SI (2005) p. 149 n. 4; Fisher (2005) p. 91; Raven (2005a) p. 63; Boardman, SI (2004); Campbell of Airds (2000) pp. 71‚Äì72, 114‚Äì115; Roberts (1999) p. 200; Murray, A (1998) p. 5; McDonald (1997) pp. 189‚Äì190 n. 120; Munro; Munro (1986) pp. 11 ¬ß 7, 283 n. 13; Barrow (1980) p. 139 n. 110; Macphail (1914) pp. 110‚Äì111; Origines Parochiales Scotiae (1854) p. 201, 201 n. 1; Document 3/0/0 (n.d.). it is clear that Raghnall succeeded in securing the region, and was regarded as the chief of Clann Ruaidhr√≠ by most of his kin. One possibility is that the scheme between Christina and Art√∫r was undertaken in the context of a marital alliance between her and Art√∫r's family, the Caimb√©alaigh.Raven (2005a) p. 63; Campbell of Airds (2004) pp. 142‚Äì143; Campbell of Airds (2000) pp. 71‚Äì72, 114‚Äì115, 226. Robert is otherwise known to have granted the constableship of Dunstaffnage Castle, a former Clann Dubhghaill stronghold, to a certain Art√∫r Caimb√©al.Penman, M (2014) pp. 245‚Äì246; Boardman, S (2006) pp. 45, 54 n. 56; Boardman, SI (2005) pp. 124, 149 n. 4; Campbell of Airds (2004b) p. 142; Campbell of Airds (2000) pp. xiv, xviii, 70, 74‚Äì75, 114, 225‚Äì226; Duncan (1988) p. 242; Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1975) p. 210 ¬ß 287; Thomson, JM (1912) pp. 534 ¬ß 535, 535 ¬ß 368; Origines Parochiales Scotiae (1854) p. 117. The precise identity of this officer is uncertain, however, as there was a father and son who bore this name.Boardman, S (2006) p. 54 n. 56.

The establishment of the constabulary of Dunstaffnage Castle in the 1320s appears to have been undertaken in the context of royally sanctioned encroachment into Clann Ruaidhr√≠ territories. Christina attempted to transfer the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ lordship into the hands of the constable's son. In 1325, a certain \\"\\" suffered the forfeiture of his possessions by Robert.Penman, M (2014) pp. 259‚Äì260, 391 n. 166; Penman, MA (2014) pp. 74‚Äì75, 74‚Äì75 n. 42; Petre (2014) p. 272; Barrow, GWS (2005) p. 389; Brown, M (2004) p. 267 n. 18; McQueen (2002) p. 187; Murray, N (2002) p. 224; Roberts (1999) p. 181; McDonald (1997) p. 187; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 283 n. 15; Reid (1984) p. 416; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203, 203 n. 12; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 205 n. 9; Thomson, JM (1912) p. 557 ¬ß 699; The Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland (1844) p. 483 ¬ß 14; RPS, A1325/2 (n.d.a); RPS, A1325/2 (n.d.b). Although this record could refer to a member of Clann Domhnaill,Cameron (2014) pp. 153‚Äì154; Penman, MA (2014) pp. 74‚Äì75 n. 42; Petre (2014) pp. 272, 268 tab.; McQueen (2002) p. 287 n. 18; Murray, N (2002) pp. 222‚Äì223 tab., 224; McDonald (1997) p. 187; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203, 203 n. 12. another possibility is that the individual actually refers to a member of Clann Ruaidhr√≠.Penman, M (2014) pp. 259, 391 n. 166; Penman, MA (2014) pp. 74‚Äì75; Petre (2014) p. 272; Penman, M (2008); Penman, MA (2005) pp. 28, 84. If this record indeed refers to a member of the latter kindred, the man in question may well have been Raghnall himself. If so, the forfeiture could have stemmed from resistance advanced by Raghnall to counter Christina's attempts to alienate the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ estate from him and transfer it into the clutches of the Caimb√©alaigh.Penman, M (2014) pp. 259‚Äì260. Alternately, the forfeiture could have been ratified in response to undesirable Clann Ruaidhr√≠ expansion into certain neighbouring territories, regions such as the former lands of the disinherited Clann Dubhghaill.Penman, M (2008). Although the now- ruinous Teampull na Trionaid is traditionally said to have been constructed by Christina's niece, √Åine Nic Ruaidhr√≠,Raven (2005a) pp. 255, 326; Macphail (1914) p. 26. this church is recorded to have been in existence during Christina's floruit.Penman, M (2014) p. 359 n. 82; Stell (2014) p. 293, 293 n. 85; Stell (2006) pp. 63 ¬ß 3.2, 102 n. 152; Barrow, GWS (2005) p. 220; Raven (2005a) pp. 63, 255; Munro; Munro (1986) pp. 13‚Äì14 ¬ß 10, 28‚Äì29 ¬ß 18, 283 n. 13; The Royal Commission (1928) p. 48 ¬ß 160; Macphail (1914) p. 25 n. 2; Lindsay; Dowden; Thomson (1908) pp. 136‚Äì137 ¬ß¬ß 142‚Äì143, 236 ¬ß¬ß 142‚Äì143; Liber Insule Missarum (1847) p. 51 ¬ß 50. Although Christina's resignation charter to Art√∫r is undated,Boardman, S (2006) p. 55 n. 62; Campbell of Airds (2000) pp. 71‚Äì72. it could date to just before the forfeiture. The list of witnesses who attested the grant is remarkable,Penman, M (2014) p. 260; Boardman, S (2006) pp. 46‚Äì47. and may be evidence that the charter had royal approval.Penman, M (2014) p. 260. The witnesses include: John Menteith, Domhnall Caimb√©al, Alasdair Mac Neachdainn, E√≥ghan Mac √çomhair, Donnchadh Caimb√©al (son of Tom√°s Caimb√©al), Niall Mac Giolla E√°in, and (the latter's brother) Domhnall Mac Giolla E√°in.Penman, M (2014) p. 260; Boardman, S (2006) pp. 46‚Äì47; Campbell of Airds (2000) pp. 71‚Äì72; Macphail (1914) pp. 110‚Äì111; Document 3/0/0 (n.d.). These men all seem to have been close adherents of Robert against Clann Dubhghaill, and all represented families of power along the western seaboard. An alliance of such men may well have been an intimidating prospect to the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ leadership.Boardman, S (2006) pp. 46‚Äì47. The forfeiture could have been personally reinforced by Robert, as he seems to have travelled to Tarbert Castle‚Äîan imposing royal stronghold in Kintyre‚Äîwithin the same year.Penman, M (2014) p. 260; Penman, MA (2014) pp. 74‚Äì75 n. 42. There is reason to suspect that the establishment of the Caimb√©alaigh constabulary of Dunstaffnage formed part of a plan to create a new western sheriffdom based at Tarbert.Penman, M (2014) p. 245; Boardman, S (2006) pp. 44‚Äì45; Duncan (1988) p. 242; Dunbar; Duncan (1971) p. 14. Although the king had previously allowed the succession of Raghnall's father in the first decade of the century, it is evident that by the early 1320s the Scottish Crown was allowing and assisting in the expansion of families such as the Caimb√©alaigh at the expense of families like Clann Ruaidhr√≠.Penman, M (2014) pp. 245‚Äì246; Boardman, S (2006) pp. 44‚Äì45; Thomson, JM (1912) pp. 533‚Äì534 ¬ß¬ß 350‚Äì353. In fact, it may have been at the Scone parliament of 1323‚Äîperhaps at the same time that work on Tarbert Castle was authorised‚Äîthat the constabulary was granted to the Caimb√©alaigh, along with lands in Benderloch, Ardnastaffnage, Inverawe, and other places in Lorn. This royal grant may well have overturned previous grants of former Clann Dubhghaill possessions to members of Clann Ruaidhr√≠.Penman, M (2014) p. 245; Document 1/53/197 (n.d.). Eilean Tioram, the tidal island upon which sits Castle Tioram, is first attested in Christina's charter to Art√∫r. Christina's charter to Art√∫r grants the latter the territories of Moidart, Arisaig, Morar, the islands of Eigg and Rhum together with the small islands that belonged to them, as well as Eilean Tioram. For his part, Art√∫r and his heirs were compelled to outfit a ship of twenty oars for the common army of the King of Scotland. Whilst Christina's charter includes most of the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ lands noted in her brother's earlier royal grant, it fails to note a significant swathe of lands on Uist. One possibility is that Christina intended for these island territories to be retained by herself or perhaps a male representative of Clann Ruaidhr√≠, whilst diverting the bulk of the family estate to the Caimb√©alaigh. On the other hand, it is also possible that the unnoted island territories were no longer part of the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ lordship.Raven (2005a) pp. 63‚Äì64, 67. Now-ruinous Inchaffray Abbey is recorded to have been patronised by Robert IEwan (2006); Barrow, GWS (2005) p. 220, 412; Lindsay; Dowden; Thomson (1908) pp. 116‚Äì117 ¬ß¬ß 123‚Äì124; Liber Insule Missarum (1847) p. 79 ¬ß¬ß 82‚Äì83. and Christina herself. Two later charter confirmations record that, at some point during her career, Christina granted Teampull na Trionaid (Church of the Holy Trinity), and certain lands in Carinish and Illeray on Uist, to Inchaffray Abbey. The first of these confirmations is a 1389 grant of Gofraidh Mac Domhnaill,Penman, M (2014) p. 359 n. 82; Stell (2014) p. 293, 293 n. 85; Stell (2006) pp. 63 ¬ß 3.2, 102 n. 152; Barrow, GWS (2005) p. 220; Raven (2005a) pp. 63, 255; Munro; Munro (1986) pp. 13‚Äì14 ¬ß 10, 283 n. 13; The Royal Commission (1928) p. 48 ¬ß 160; Macphail (1914) p. 25 n. 2; Lindsay; Dowden; Thomson (1908) pp. 136 ¬ß 142, 236 ¬ß 142; Liber Insule Missarum (1847) p. 51 ¬ß 50. a man whose mother was √Åine Nic Ruaidhr√≠, Christina's niece.Stell (2014) p. 293. The second confirmation is a 1410 grant of Gofraidh's half-brother, Domhnall Mac Domhnaill, Lord of the Isles.Penman, M (2014) p. 359 n. 82; Stell (2014) p. 293; Stell (2006) p. 63 ¬ß 3.2; Barrow, GWS (2005) p. 220; Raven (2005a) pp. 63, 255; Munro; Munro (1986) pp. 28‚Äì29 ¬ß 18, 283 n. 13; The Royal Commission (1928) p. 48 ¬ß 160; Macphail (1914) p. 25 n. 2; Lindsay; Dowden; Thomson (1908) pp. 137 ¬ß 143, 236 ¬ß 143. Whilst is it possible that these two confirmations indeed preserve evidence of ecclesiastical grants made by Christina, it is also possible that the confirmations are unreliable. For example, the records could have been fabricated to include Christina as a means of furthering the territorial claims of the Clann Domhnaill branch descended from Gofraidh.Raven (2005a) p. 63. If the confirmations are reliable, however, they could indicate that Christina was granting away lands formerly held by other members of her family‚Äîlands which may have been forfeited.Raven (2005a) p. 64. Furthermore, if the confirmations are to be believed, Christina's patronage of Inchaffray Abbey could be further evidence of her association with the Bruces, since this religious house in known to have been patronised by Robert himself. The ruins of Saddell Abbey, a religious house originally founded by ancestors of Clann Ruaidhr√≠,Fisher (2005) p. 86; Stringer (2005) p. 58; Sellar (2000) p. 203; Brown, AL (1969) pp. 130‚Äì133. and patronised by Christina herself. Christina's contract with Art√∫r may have had later consequences, as exemplified by the royal executions of two Highland chieftains in 1428: a certain Alasdair Mac Ruaidhr√≠ and E√≥in Mac Artair, both who are recorded to have commanded one thousand men apiece.Boardman, S (2006) p. 126; Boardman, SI (2005) p. 133; Campbell of Airds (2004) p. 142; Campbell of Airds (2000) pp. 114‚Äì116, 226; Brown, MH (1991) pp. 290‚Äì291; Watt (1987) p. 261; Origines Parochiales Scotiae (1854) p. 201; Turnbull (1842) p. 232; Goodall (1759) p. 489 bk. 16 ch. 15; Hearnius (1722b) pp. 1283‚Äì1284. Although the identities of these men are uncertain, it is possible that the former was a member of Clann Ruaidhr√≠,Boardman, S (2006) pp. 126, 137 n. 53; Boardman, SI (2004); Campbell of Airds (2000) pp. 114‚Äì115, 226. and that the latter was a member of the Strachur branch of the Caimb√©alaigh,Boardman, S (2006) pp. 126, 137 n. 53; Boardman, SI (2005) p. 133; Campbell of Airds (2004) p. 142; Campbell of Airds (2000) pp. 114‚Äì115, 226. and seemingly a descendant of Art√∫r himself.Campbell of Airds (2004) p. 142; Campbell of Airds (2000) pp. 114‚Äì115, 226; Origines Parochiales Scotiae (1854) p. 201. As such, the executed chieftains could have been continuing a feud that stemmed from Christina's contested inheritance and connections with the Caimb√©alaigh.Boardman, S (2006) pp. 126, 137 n. 53; Campbell of Airds (2004) p. 142; Campbell of Airds (2000) pp. 114‚Äì116, 226.

Life  Hynce Pt√°ƒçek of Pirkstein came from a side line of the noble Leipa family. He was the son of Jan Pt√°ƒçek of Pirkstein and Jitka of Kun≈°t√°t. From 1420 he was in possession of Rataje nad S√°zavou and he soon rose to the highest court master and mint master of the Kingdom of Bohemia and the acting regent of the royal cities. As a moderate representative of the Hussites he fought in 1434 in the Battle of Lipan on the side of Prague. After Sigismund's death in 1437 he and George of Podƒõbrady, his prot√©g√© and future provincial administrator and King of Bohemia, joined the influential group of nobles who boycotted, the election of Sigismund's son-in-law Albert II to King of Bohemia.

In 1440, Hynce Pt√°ƒçek of Pirkstein along with other nobles founded the regional Landfrieden alliance, to maintain the peace. As leader of the alliance, Hynce Pt√°ƒçek of Pirkstein convened a meeting at ƒå√°slav in 1441, where the alliance decided to take action against the robber baron Jan Kolda of ≈Ωampach, who had illegally occupied several possessions in East Bohemia.

Crime in Spain is combated by Spain's law enforcement agencies.  Crime by type  =Murder= In 2012, Spain had a murder rate of 0.8 per 100,000 population. There were a total of 364 murders in Spain in 2012. Many terrorist attacks have occurred in Spain, the most deadly of which was the 2004 Madrid train bombings. = Drug- related crime = Spain is the principal route of entry of drugs and narcotics into the European Union. Indeed, about half of the cocaine found by law enforcement agencies in Europe is found by Spanish police. Spain has a high number of drug users, leading the table of cocaine users in Europe.  Cocaine importation  Cocaine usage in Spain is high by world standards. Spain is a major transit point for cocaine entering Europe. After arrival in Spain, much of the cocaine is then trafficked to other countries. In 2005, over 50% of the cocaine found by police in Europe was found by Spanish police. The so-called Galician mafia is the main trafficker of cocaine into Spain and to European countries such as the United Kingdom. = Background level of crime against tourists = The US Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs advised travellers in 2011 that Spain had a \\"moderate rate of crime\\". Street crimes against tourists occur in the principal tourist areas. Madrid and Barcelona, in particular, report incidents of \\"pick-pocketing, mugging, and occasional violent attacks\\". In Madrid, incidents have been reported in \\"all major tourist areas, including the area near the Prado Museum, near Atocha train station, in Retiro Park, in areas of old Madrid including near the Royal Palace, and in Plaza Mayor\\". In Barcelona, the largest number of incidents reported also occurred in major tourist areas. Embassy of the United States in Spain issued a warning to its nationals against the increasing violent crime in Barcelona. The embassy highlighted crimes, which were recently committed in the most popular tourist places, such as, the theft of jewelry, money and watches. These offenses have physically harmed the victims in some cases.  Crime statistics  Crime statistics for Spain are published annually by the Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica. Different agencies of Spain and the European Union conduct analysis of the crime data in Spain. Statistics show Spain is one of the European countries with the lowest crime rate, according to a 2005 Gallop Europe research study. The rate of misdemeanours and crimes in Spain was 46 per 1,000 people in 2009. In 2013 Spain had one of the lowest crime rates in Europe.

He was elected in April 2011 as member of the Board of Trustees of the Arab Human Rights Organization in Syria.  Biography  Born in Algeria to Syrian parents from Ariha, a town close to Aleppo, Ammar al- Qurabi trained as a dentist at the University of Aleppo. Qurabi was a member of the banned Arab Socialist Party from 1985 to 1999, and served as Secretary of its Aleppo branch from 1989 until his resignation from the Party in 1999. In addition to establishing the Arab Human Rights Organization in Syria,Arab Human Rights Organization in Syria Qurabi has worked with the Syrian Human Rights Committee, the Arab Commission for Human Rights and Human Rights Watch. He was a founding member and official spokesperson of the Arab Human Rights Organization in Syria from 2004 until his arrest and travel ban in 2006. He led the Arab Commission for Human Rights in Paris and monitored four sessions of the trial of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt between August and September 2007. Qurabi attended the third session of the launch of the Arab Network for Human Rights Information in August 2007. He was involved in the submission of a report on prison conditions in Syria to the Arab Organization for Penal Reformhttp://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session7/EG/APRO_UPR_EGY_S07_2010_ArabPenalReformOrganization.pdf at a conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt on 6 June 2007. He was a member of an Arab fact-finding mission to Gaza in February 2009. Qurabi has published widely on human rights issues (civil liberties, freedom, social and economic rights, gender discrimination, children, migrant workers, political corruption, torture, and abuses in the criminal justice system), documenting abuses and bringing attention to human rights violations in Syria.  Role in the 2011 Syrian uprising  Dr. Ammar Al-Qurabi played a prominent role in highlighting human rights violations by the Syrian authorities during the 2011 Syrian uprising. His National Organization for Human Rights in Syria was main organizer of the Antalya Conference for Change in Syria in June 2011, and though al-Qurabi was one of the conference's main funders as well, he only attended as an observer. A frequent commentator in the Arab media, Qurabi has helped focus international attention on the deteriorating human rights situation in Syria by describing media censorship, the harassment and detention of journalists and bloggers, the arrest of political and human rights activists and violence against protesters and political dissidents. Through the National Organization for Human Rights in Syria, Qurabi has verified and documented reports of torture, ill-treatment, forced disappearance, arbitrary arrest and unlawful detention. He has criticized the lack of judicial independence and arbitrary procedures that have systematically resulted in violations of the right to fair trial, and described Syria's multi-layered security apparatus which continues to detain people without arrest warrants and frequently refuses to disclose their whereabouts for weeks and sometimes months ‚Äì in effect forcibly disappearing them. He has brought attention to the sub-standard health and sanitation conditions of Syrian prisons, and described and documented methods of torture and abuse of prisoners including the use of electric shock; pulling out fingernails; burning genitalia; beating, sometimes while the victim was suspended from the ceiling; dousing victims with freezing water and beating them in extremely cold rooms; hyper-extending the spine; and bending detainees into the frame of a wheel and whipping exposed body parts.  Arrests and restrictions  20 August 2003: Arrested in Aleppo and sentenced by a state security court to three months in prison for establishing and leading an information committee in support of 14 political prisoners facing military court trials.

Nigerian Accounting Standards Board NASB was established in 1982 as a private sector initiative closely associated with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN). NASB became a government agency in 1992, reporting to the Federal Minister of Commerce. The Nigerian Accounting Standards Board Act of 2003 provided the legal framework under which NASB set accounting standards. Membership includes representatives of government and other interest groups. Both ICAN and the Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN) nominate two members to the board. The primary functions as defined in the act of 10 July 2003 were to develop, publish and update Statements of Accounting Standards to be followed by companies when they prepare their financial statement, and to promote and enforce compliance with the standards. IASB had published many of the earlier standards prepared by the International Accounting Standards Committee and its successor the International Accounting Standards Board, but was more involved in enforcement than in updating to the more modern International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). A 2010 report commissioned by the International Monetary Fund said that the NASB did not have adequate funding to achieve its statutory role. NASB urgently needed to hire new staff, retrain existing staff and offer more attractive pay. In June 2010 Mr. Godson Nnadi, Executive Secretary of Nigeria Accounting Standards Board, spoke in favor of a new body to set accounting and auditing standards for Nigeria and other African nations. The new body would be independent of both ANAN and ICAN. As well as ensuring consistency between countries, costs to each country would be lower due to sharing of the effort. Financial Reporting Council On 18 May 2011 the Senate passed the Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria Bill, which repealed the Nigerian Accounting Standards Board Act and replaced it with a new set of rules. The decision was in line with a report submitted by Senator Ahmed Makarfi, Chairman of the Senate committee on Finance. The Executive Secretary of NASB, Jim Osayande Obazee, had strongly supported this bill, which he said would align Nigeria with other countries and improve investor confidence. In June 2011 the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, spoke at a fundraising dinner organized by the NASB for the IFRS academy. Sanusi said that the move to adopt the IFRS would help attract foreign direct investments to Nigeria. At the same event, the NASB Chairman, Michael Adebisi Popoola, called for abrogation of regulations and laws that are incompatible with IFRS. The Financial Reporting Council Bill was signed into law on 20 July 2011. According to Olusegun Aganga, minister of Trade and Investment, \\"More meaningful and decision enhancing information can now be arrived at from financial statements issued in Nigeria because accounting, actuarial, valuation and auditing standards, used in the preparation of these statements, shall be issued and regulated by this Financial Reporting Council. The FRC is a unified independent regulatory body for accounting, auditing, actuarial, valuation and corporate governance. As such, compliance monitoring in these areas will hence be addressed from the platform of professionalism and legislation\\".

She was heiress of Toron as well as a claimant to the throne of Armenia. She married three times; by her second marriage she was Countess of Tripoli, and she only had children from this marriage. Life =Early life and first marriage= Alice was the elder of two children born to Prince Ruben and his wife Isabella; Alice's younger sister was Philippa of Armenia. At the time of her father's death, Alice was four or five years of age. He abdicated and died in 1187, and was succeeded by his brother Leo. Leo was initially the 'Regent and Tutor' of his young nieces but he eventually set them aside and was succeeded by his own descendants. Isabella died sometime between 1192 and 1229, and upon her death, Alice became heiress of Toron; Toron was occupied by Muslims at the time. Around 1189, both Alice and Philippa were betrothed. Alice was betrothed to Hathum, Lord of Sasun and Philippa to a son of the Lord of Sasun. Both sisters married roughly around the same time in 1189. In May, 1193, their spouses were both murdered. The sisters are mentioned by Sempad the Constable as their widows. Sempad also recorded contemporary rumours that their uncle Leo was behind both assassinations.Sempad the Constable, Le Royaume Armenien de Cilicie. Since Alice was only eleven-years-old and Philippa ten, the marriages were likely not consummated.ARMENIA, Medieval Lands =Second marriage= Alice was secondly betrothed to Raymond IV, Count of Tripoli, in order to bring peace between Raymond's family in Antioch and Alice's family in Armenia. They needed permission from Henry II, Count of Champagne, husband of Isabella I of Jerusalem for the marriage, which he gave them after Alice's uncle released Raymond's father Bohemond III, Prince of Antioch. Alice and Raymond were married around 1195. The couple were only married for roughly three years before Raymond died; Alice being pregnant at the time. According to Sempad, it was agreed that any son born of the marriage would succeed her uncle in Armenia.Sempad, 643 (1 Feb 1194/31 Jan 1195), p. 632. Months after Raymond's death, Alice gave birth to a son, Raymond-Roupen.Sempad, 643 (1 Feb 1194/31 Jan 1195), p. 632. After the birth of her son, Alice was sent back to her homeland of Armenia from Antioch by her father-in-law. However, Bohemond agreed to make Raymond Roupen his heir. In 1201, Bohemond died and went back on his word, making his younger son Bohemond Prince of Antioch instead. In 1216, Bohemond was overthrown with the help of Leo, and Raymond Roupen was made Prince of Antioch. However, this only lasted until 1219 when Bohemond conquered and re-gained control. =Third marriage and later life= On 2 May 1219, King Leo died and left Armenia to his younger daughter, Isabelle; under the regency firstly of Adam of Baghras and after his assassination, Constantine of Baberon. Several factions were against the succession and other candidates pressed their claims. Sybilla of Lusignan, mother of Isabelle put her claim on the throne but was exiled by Constantine. Leo's older daughter Stephanie put her claim forward along with that of her young son, but they later died. In 1219, Alice claimed the throne on behalf of her son; to strengthen the claim, in 1220 she married Vahram, Lord of Korikos. In 1222, Constantine had Vahram murdered, Raymond-Roupen either died in battle or died in prison and Alice was imprisoned and later exiled.Armenia, Medieval Lands Raymond-Roupen left Alice with a granddaughter, Maria of Antioch-Armenia, who succeeded as Lady of Toron and unsuccessfully claimed Armenia. Isabelle was then left as the legitimate heir to the throne. After her release, Alice turned to her inheritance rights in Palestine. From her mother she had inherited the rights to Toron and Oultrejordain, and stakes in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, but the Kingdom had not occupied since 1187 by Christians since the Muslim invasion. Toron had been taken over by the Muslims in 1219. Toron was recovered through the treaty of Jaffa in 1229, just two years after al- Mu'azzam's death on November 11, 1227, by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor from Sultan al-Kamil. As Toron was sold in 1220 to the Teutonic Knights together with the territories called the Seigneury de Joscelin, it came to a dispute between them and Alice. She successfully claimed her rights before the High Court and Frederick II assigned the lordship to her. Alice died sometime after 1234. She managed to outlive all three of her husbands, her sister, son and uncle. Toron passed to her granddaughter Maria.

His obituary in The London PhilatelistLondon Philatelist Vol. 15 1905 pp 88-89 referred to him as the \\"Father of Philately\\" and elsewhere he was described as the vieille garde (old guard) of philately having been actively collecting and writing about stamps since 1860.\\"The Death of Dr. Viner\\" in The London Philatelist, Vol. XV, No.172, April 1906, pp. 88-89. In 1921 he was entered on the Roll of Distinguished Philatelists as one of the founding Fathers of philately. Early days According to Fred Melville, Viner first became interested in stamp collecting in about 1855 when a lady friend asked him to help her compile a chart representative of the stamps of the world, but Viner did not start his own collection until 1860. However, he noted in 1882Stamp News, October 1882, Volume 1, Issue 9/10 pp 79-80 that he saw his first collection in 1854 which was based on an earlier collection owned by someone called Scales. Viner was quoted as saying in 1889: \\"I remember counting my stamps with much glee when they reached a hundred.\\" and \\"I saw some collections with two or three hundred and heard of one with five hundred. Cancelled specimens were principally seen; but I can recall one collection rich in unused Naples, Sicily, Tuscany and other Italian States purchased at their several post-offices by a young traveller.\\"Melville, Fred J.

The battalion was raised around volunteers from the Royal Sussex Regiment at Kibrit in the Middle East. Assigned to the 4th Parachute Brigade, they joined the 1st Airborne Division in Tunisia. The battalion fought their first action in Operation Slapstick part of the Allied invasion of Italy. They were then withdrawn to England at the end of 1943. Being held in reserve during the Normandy landings, their second action was in Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands. The battalion landed on the second day of the Battle of Arnhem and unable to reach their assigned objective, it was gradually destroyed over two days of fighting. The surviving men managed to withdraw into the divisional position at Oosterbeek. After holding a position in the perimeter, the handful of men left were evacuated south of the River Rhine. The battalion never recovered from the heavy casualties, sustained during the battle and was disbanded. The surviving men being posted to the battalions of the 1st Parachute Brigade. When the Territorial Army was reformed after the war in 1947. A new 10th Battalion was raised. It was part of the reserve 44th Parachute Brigade in the 16th Airborne Division. However, as a result of defence cuts the battalion was eventually amalgamated with the 4th Battalion. Background British paratroops wearing 'jump jackets', in Norwich during exercises 23 June 1941 Impressed by the success of German airborne operations, during the Battle of France, the then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, directed the War Office to investigate the possibility of creating a corps of 5,000 parachute troops.Otway, p.21 The standards set for British airborne troops was extremely high, and from the first group of 3,500 volunteers only 500 men were accepted to go forward to parachute training.Reynolds, p.4 Additionally on 22 June 1940, a British Commando unit, No. 2 Commando was turned over to parachute duties and on 21 November, re-designated the 11th Special Air Service Battalion, with a parachute and glider wing.Shortt & McBride, p.4Moreman, p.91 It was these men who took part in the first British airborne operation, Operation Colossus, on 10 February 1941.Guard, p.218 The success of the raid prompted the War Office to expand the existing airborne force, setting up the Airborne Forces Depot and Battle School in Derbyshire in April 1942, and creating the Parachute Regiment as well as converting a number of infantry battalions into airborne battalions in August 1942.Harclerode, p. 218 =10th Parachute Battalion= 10th Battalion, The Parachute Regiment was formed in Egypt. The battalion was then assigned to the 4th Parachute Brigade, joining the 156th Parachute Battalion.Cole, p.32 Upon formation, the battalion had an establishment of 556 men in three rifle companies. The companies were divided into a small headquarters and three platoons. The platoons had three Bren machine guns and three 2-inch mortars, one of each per section. The only heavy weapons in the battalion were a 3 inch mortar and a Vickers machine gun platoon.Peters, p.55 By 1944 a headquarters or support company, was added to the battalion, comprising five platoons: motor transport, signals, mortar, machine-gun and anti-tank. With eight 3 inch mortars, four Vickers machine guns and ten PIAT anti-tank projectors.Guard, p.37 Parachute troops jumping from an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley near Windsor in England. All members of the battalion had to undergo a parachute training course carried out at No. 2 Parachute Training School at RAF Kirbrit in Egypt.Reynolds, p.17 Initial parachute jumps were from a converted barrage balloon and finished with five parachute jumps from an aircraft. Anyone failing to complete a descent was returned to his old unit. Those men who successfully completed the parachute course, were presented with their maroon beret and parachute wings.Guard, p.224Guard, p.226 Airborne soldiers were expected to fight against superior numbers of the enemy, armed with heavy weapons, including artillery and tanks. So training was designed to encourage a spirit of self-discipline, self- reliance and aggressiveness. Emphasis was given to physical fitness, marksmanship and fieldcraft.Guard, p.225 A large part of the training regime consisted of assault courses and route marching. Military exercises included capturing and holding airborne bridgeheads, road or rail bridges and coastal fortifications. At the end of most exercises, the battalion would march back to their barracks. An ability to cover long distances at speed was expected: airborne platoons were required to cover a distance of in 24 hours, and battalions . Operations =Italy= On 26 May 1943, the battalion and brigade sailed from Palestine for Tripoli, where it joined the 1st Airborne Division. A shortage of transport aircraft kept the battalion out of the Allied invasion of Sicily. Other units of the division however did take part. The 1st Airlanding Brigade took part in Operation Ladbroke and the 1st Parachute Brigade in Operation Fustian. Both brigades suffered heavy casualties, so that by the time Operation Slapstick was proposed, only the 2nd and 4th Parachute Brigades were up to strength.Ferguson, p.13 Slapstick was in part a deception operation to divert German forces from the main Allied landings and also an attempt to seize intact the Italian ports of Taranto, Bari and Brindisi.Blumenson, p.94 The lack of air transport meant that the division's two available brigades had to be transported by sea. They would cross the Mediterranean in four Royal Navy cruisers with their escorts. If the landing was successful, the 78th Infantry Division in Sicily and the 8th Indian Infantry Division in the Middle East, under the command of the V Corps would be sent to reinforce the landings.Blumenson, p.95 The 4th Parachute Brigade only had the 10th and 156th Parachute Battalions available to take part in the landings. On 9 September 1943, the same day as the Salerno landings by the US 5th Army, the battalion having crossed the Mediterranean in landed at Taranto unopposed.Reynolds, p.37 Their first objective was the airfield of Gioia del Colle inland, was secured on 16 September.Reynolds, p.38 However en route to the airfield near the town of Castellaneta, the battalion came up against a German roadblock defended by a Fallschirmjaeger unit of the 1st German Parachute Division.Dover, p. 82 During their assault on the roadblock, the divisional commander Major-General George F. Hopkinson observing the action, was hit by a burst of machine gun fire and killed.Harclerode, p. 262 At the same time, the 156th Parachute Battalion at San Basilio, carried out a successful flank attack on Fallschirmjaeger defending the town. Two days later, having been only involved in minor skirmishes, the battalion reached Bari and Brindisi. Playing no further part in operations in Italy, the battalion were withdrawn by sea to the United Kingdom, arriving in November 1943. =Arnhem= Arnhem 18 September 1944 The 10th Battalion and the rest of the 4th Parachute Brigade landed to the west of Arnhem on the second day of the battle 18 September 1944. Their objective was to hold a position on the high ground north of Arnhem at Koepel.Peters, p.168 With the 156th Parachute Battalion leading on the right, the 10th Battalion followed slightly behind on the left. By dawn the following day the battalion was just north of the Rotterdam to Arnhem railway line. When they came under attack from German 88 mm guns.Peters, pp.168‚Äì169 Both battalions were ordered to start an assault on the position at 07:00, but after repeated attacks the battalion had got no further forward. The defenders from the 9th SS Panzer Division had been here for two days and were well dug in.Peters, p.173 Casualties were heavy and brigade headquarters obtained permission to withdraw south of the rail line into Oosterbeek. The battalion started to pull back but found most of their intended new positions already occupied by the Germans and by 15:00 had lost communications with brigade. To cross back over the rail line the battalion first had to capture the crossing point at Wolfheze.Peters, p.174 Just before the attack a diversion was provided by the arrival of the 1st Polish Parachute Brigades gliders. Unaware the landing-zones had been captured or were under fire 10 percent of the Poles were killed during the landings.Peters, p.183 The battalion withdrew remaining in contact with the advancing German tanks and infantry and under mortar fire. Part of the rearguard left behind was commanded by Captain Lionel Queripel who was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his actions during the withdrawal.Peters, p.186 As the battalion left the woods they moved onto the open ground of landing-zone L, occupied by the Poles who had just landed. In the confusion both sides open fire on each other, at the same time coming under fire from the following Germans.Peters, p.184 The battalion headed towards Wolfheze and prepared to defend the village assisted by 'B' and 'Support' Companies, 156th Parachute Battalion which had become separated from their battalion.Peters, p.185 Casualties had continued to mount and by 20 September the German tactics were to bombard the British positions with tank and mortar fire.Peters, pp.204‚Äì206 The remnants of the battalion were withdrawn into the perimeter formed by the division around Oosterbeek. Only 60 men were able to continue fighting and this small force were given a position on the north eastern side to defend. One of them was the commanding officer Lieutenant-Colonel Ken Smyth who although wounded remained with the battalion.Peters, p.207 By 21 September pressure from the German attacks had squeezed the perimeter to less than across.Peters, p.222 A German self propelled gun now drove up and down the battalions position, shooting high explosive shells into any buildings they believed to be defended. The battalion having expended all its anti-tank ammunition were unable to do anything to stop the gun.Peters, p.223 The gun was followed up by infantry who fighting at close quarters forced the battalion out of their defensive positions. All the battalions surviving officers were killed or wounded during this attack and the battalion was in danger of being overrun. However small isolated units managed to hold out until reinforced by the Pathfinders of the 21st Independent Parachute Company.Peters, pp. 223‚Äì224 On 22 September the bulk of the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade were dropped south of the river. This drew off some of the Germans from around the divisional perimeter to confront the new threat. The defenders now had to cope with over 100 German artillery guns firing onto their positions.Peters, p.234 By 23 September the battalions position was subjected to constant mortar and artillery fire and incursions by tanks and infantry were becoming more and more frequent. Casualties forced a contraction of the perimeter but first the Germans had to be evicted from the houses behind them which they were to occupy.Peters, pp.247‚Äì254 On 24 September the decision was made by Lieutenant-General Horrocks commander XXX Corps to withdraw what was left of the division south of the Rhine.Peters, p.265 The remnants of the battalion were evacuated over the night of 25/26 September.Peters, pp.279‚Äì283 The casualties sustained were never replaced and the battalion was disbanded after the battle. Of the 582 men of the battalion who landed on 18 September, 92 were killed, 404 became prisoners of War and 96 were evacuated. Territorial Army The 10th Battalion was disbanded in November 1945, but when the Territorial Army was reformed in 1947, a new reserve Parachute Regiment battalion now called the 10th (City of London) Parachute Battalion (Territorial Army) was raised. Re-designated 10 PARA (Volunteer) in 1967, the battalion existed until it was disbanded in 1999. For a time the battalion was represented by 10 (London) Company, 4th Battalion, Parachute Regiment however this was later renamed to B company when the 4th Battalion moved from using numbers to letters for company names. Unit Locations prior to disbanding: HQ Coy ‚Äì Chelsea, 1 Coy ‚Äì White City, 2 Coy ‚Äì Croydon and Blackheath, 3 Coy ‚Äì Finchley, 4 Coy ‚Äì Chelsea, 5 (HSF) Coy ‚Äì Chelsea, Support Coy ‚Äì Aldershot (Machine Gun Pl and Antitank Pl), 2nd Anti- Tank Pln ‚Äì Portsmouth (Briefly), Mortar Pln ‚Äì Leigh-on-Sea. 10 Para took part in many overseas exercises, including Germany, Holland, USA, Gibraltar, Cyprus, Norway, and took part in \\"S type\\" secondments within regular parachute battalions. In 1995 volunteers joined the 2nd Battalion The Light Infantry, an armored infantry formation, on \\"S type\\" secondment for active service in Bosnia on Op Grapple 7 (UNPROFOR) and subsequently Op Resolute (NATO). In the early 1990s, selected 10 Para men also took part in trials of the new low level parachute, and laser rangefinders. The Battalion also formed part of the 5th Airborne Brigade, with greater training emphasis being placed on CQB, FIBUA, additional night jumps, and support roles in hostage rescue, and evacuation. Each year, to remember Operation Market Garden, men from 10 Para would parachute from RAF Hercules aircraft onto Ginkel Heath near Arnhem. On landing the paras would be met by hundreds of Dutch well wishers, school children, and veterans to remember the events of 1944. On the Sunday, they would attend an open-air service at the Oosterbeek Cemetery, often attended by the Dutch Royal family, and key veterans, like retired Major General John Frost.

Crime in Greece is combated by the Hellenic Police and other agencies. The crime rate in Greece has historically been amongst the lowest in Western Europe, and continues to be. During the 1980s, Greek Police Chief Nikon Arkoudeas (ŒùŒØŒ∫œâŒΩ ŒëœÅŒ∫ŒøœÖŒ¥Œ≠Œ±œÇ) led an intense campaign against organized crime, which saw significant success. Since the early 1990s, many illegal immigrants have come to Greece from Eastern and Southeast European countries, Africa and South Asia. Their sudden arrival contributed to an increase in criminal activities throughout the 1990s and 2000s. The Greek Police also had several victories, breaking up mafia organizations, arresting the 17 November terrorist group, successfully organizing security for the 2004 Olympic Games and for breaking up in 2016 the largest criminal organization in the country, responsible for more than 2.000 robberies.  Crime by type  = Murder = In 2011, Greece had a murder rate of 1.7 per 100,000 population.Global Study on Homicide. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2013. There were a total of 184 murders in Greece in 2011. =Organized crime= Organized crime in Greece is on the rise. Domestic as well as foreign criminal groups are well-entrenched in Greek society. Traditionally, people associated with organized crime were known as Men of the night (Œ¨ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøŒπ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒΩœçœáœÑŒ±œÇ). Out of the foreign criminal groups the Albanian mafia is the most prevalent. The activities of the Albanian crime groups in Greece include drug trafficking, human trafficking, extortion and robbery among others. Albanian criminal groups often extort other immigrants to Greece, especially Middle Eastern and Pakistani shopkeepers, and control many nightclubs in the working- class districts of West Athens. Russian groups are less numerous, but they are very heavily armed and dangerous; they are involved in arms trafficking, extortion and cigarette smuggling. Lower-level Romanian and Moldavian groups are involved in theft and human trafficking. Domestic, ethnic Greek criminal organizations are the most powerful and politically well-connected and extensively cooperate with Albanian groups, often hiring Albanians to act as enforcers. Greek criminal organizations are involved in human trafficking, extortion, drug trafficking, kidnapping and the infiltration of legal businesses. They have profited from the rising corruption. That is evident in the fact that Greek crime groups have infiltrated the shipping industry, which is used to traffic cocaine and heroin into the Greek mainland and abroad. Greek police on motorcycle. = Property crime = As of 2011, Greece has seen an increase in property-related crime, thought to be linked to the worsening of economic conditions. Robberies, ranging from street muggings to bank hold- ups and house burglaries, totaled about 80,000 in 2009, up from about 50,000 in 2005. The increase in property crime has seen an increase in the amount of work for private security companies. Nevertheless, the crime rate is still among the lowest in Western Europe. In 2016, the Greek police successfully broke up the country's largest criminal organization in Greece's history, which was responsible for more than 2.000 house burglaries across the country, in an operation where at least 1.000 policemen and 37 judges participated. = Immigrant crime = The Greek police have admitted that armed gangs entering the country from neighbouring Albania or Bulgaria could have been attracted by reports that many people have been withdrawing cash from banks and stashing it in their homes. \\"Greeks confront crime wave amid austerity\\", Chloe Hadjimatheou, BBC News, Athens, 16 August 2012. There are possibly more than 1 million illegal immigrants inside Greece as of 2012. \\"Greece: Illegal Immigration in the Midst of Crisis\\", Charalambos Kasimis, Agricultural University of Athens, March 2012. Cases of immigrant crime such as the 2012 Paros rape have attracted nationwide interest. Illegal immigration to Greece has increased rapidly over the past several years. Tough immigration policies in Spain and Italy and agreements with their neighboring African countries to combat illegal immigration have changed the direction of African immigration flows toward Greece. At the same time, flows from the Arab world and South Asia ‚Äî mainly Afghanistan, Algeria, Iraq, and Pakistan ‚Äî to Greece appear to have increased as well. The evidence now indicates that nearly all illegal immigration to the European Union flows through the country's porous borders. In 2010, 90 percent of all apprehensions for unauthorized entry into the European Union took place in Greece, compared to 75 percent in 2009 and 50 percent in 2008. In 2010, 132,524 persons were arrested for \\"illegal entry or stay\\" in Greece, a sharp increase from 95,239 in 2006. Nearly half of those arrested (52,469) were immediately deported, the majority of them being Albanians. = Tax evasion and corruption = Greece suffers from relatively high levels of tax evasion and political corruption, even though in recents years there has been considerable decrease.Inman, Phillip (9 September 2012) Primary Greek tax evaders are the professional classes The Guardian. Retrieved 6 October 2012 This is to the extent that tax evasion has been described by Greek politicians as \\"a national sport\\" - with up to ‚Ç¨30 billion per year going uncollected.  Extent of Greek tax evasion  The OECD estimated in August 2009 that the size of the Greek black market to be around ‚Ç¨65bn (equal to 25% of GDP), resulting each year in ‚Ç¨20bn of unpaid taxes. This is a European record in relative terms, and in comparison almost twice as big as the German black market (estimated to be 15% of GDP). Several successive Greek governments had in the past attempted to improve the situation, but all failed due to tax evasion's place within Greek culture. A rapid increase in government revenues through implementing a more effective tax collecting system has been recommended. Implementing the proper reforms, is however estimated to be a slow process, requiring at least two legislative periods before they start to work. In the last quarter of 2005, participation in tax evasion reached an estimated 49% of the population, while in January 2006 it fell to 41.6%. A study by researchers from the University of Chicago concluded that tax evasion in 2009 by self-employed professionals alone in Greece (accountants, dentists, lawyers, doctors, personal tutors and independent financial advisers) was ‚Ç¨28 billion or 31% of the budget deficit that year. The Tax Justice Network has said that there are over ‚Ç¨20 billion in Swiss bank accounts held by Greeks. The former Finance Minister of Greece, Evangelos Venizelos, was quoted as saying \\"Around 15,000 individuals and companies owe the taxman 37 billion euros\\". Additionally, the TJN puts the number of Greek- owned off-shore companies to over 10,000.  By location  = Athens = Armed robberies in Athens doubled between 2007 and 2009; however, Athens is still among the safest capitals in Europe. Thefts and break-ins jumped from 26,872 recorded cases in 2007, to 47,607 in 2009. The number of murders in Athens nearly doubled between 2007 and 2009.  Police politics One of the major criticisms addressed to the Greek Police by the Greek media is the politicization of its officer corps. Up until 1981 (when Andreas Papandreou and his Panhellenic Socialist Movement party came to power), almost all senior officers of the Greek Gendarmerie and the Cities Police were dyed-in-the-wool conservative right-wingers. These two agencies were merged in 1984 to create the Greek Police. It is not uncommon for officers to seek the patronage of a political party, and \\"cliques\\" have been formed inside the force, sometimes with a regional basis; for example, most Generals usually originate from the Peloponnese or from Crete.

It is one of the most widely distributed ferns of the wet Old World tropics and adjacent regions, including Polynesia and the Pacific.Russell, A. E., et al. (1998). The ecology of the climbing fern Dicranopteris linearis on windward Mauna Loa, Hawaii. Journal of Ecology 86 765. In parts of the New World tropics its niche is filled by its relative, Dicranopteris pectinatus. Frond closup This rhizomatous fern spreads via cloning, spreading along the ground and climbing on other vegetation, often forming thickets 3 metres deep or more. The stem grows from the rhizome, branches at a 45¬∞ angle, and forms fronds that continue to bud and branch. In this way the growth can continue for a long distance as the plant forms a mat, grows over itself in layers, and spreads.Romanchak, E., et al.

The Nature Conservancy. and can climb 10 high when supported by a tree. The ultimate segments of the leaves are linear in shape, up to 7 centimeters long by a few millimeters wide. The undersides are hairy and sometimes waxy.Dicranopteris linearis. Flora of New South Wales. It can also reproduce via spores. The fern grows easily on poorly drained, nutrient-poor soils and in disturbed habitats and steep slopes. It does not tolerate shade, so once established it will eventually be shaded out by taller vegetation unless it climbs above it. It may suppress the growth of new stands of trees, especially when it becomes a dense thicket. The fern is a keystone species in Hawaiian ecosystems, and dominates many areas in Hawaiian rainforests. It occurs on all the main Hawaiian islands. As a pioneer species in ecological succession, it can colonize bare sites such as lava flows, talus, and abandoned roads. When the fern grows onto a new site it produces layers of stems and leaves repeatedly until there is a network of vegetation. The leaves die and the stems are very slow to decompose, so the network persists. The network then fills with organic forest detritus, forming a litter layer which can be a meter thick. The network is penetrated by the fern's rhizomes and roots, such that the fern serves as its own substrate. Where the fern is eliminated, invasive species of plants can move in, so \\"one important function\\" of the fern is to prevent these plants from encroaching on the rainforest. The fern may have allelopathic effects, preventing the growth of other plants.Ismail, B. S. and C. Tut-Vun. (2007). Effects of the extract of Dicranopteris linearis on seed germination and seedling growth of selected common weeds in Malaysia. Allelopathy Journal 20:2. Also, the fern is a very productive member of the forest ecosystem; despite being a relatively small amount of the biomass in the forest it accounts for over half of the primary productivity in some areas. This plant is used medicinally to treat intestinal worms in Indochina, skin ulcers and wounds in New Guinea, and fever in Malaysia.Toji, T., et al. (2007). Antibacterial activity of Dicranopteris linearis under in vitro conditions. STARS Int. Journal (Sciences). 1:2 191-95. In vitro samples of the fern kill bacteria. The Diliman district in Quezon City in the Philippines' National Capital Region derived its name from Dicranopteris linearis, locally known as \\"Dilim\\" (the suffix \\"-an\\" indicates a place where something, in this case the fern, is common).

He was born in 1593 in G√§vle to a family of a sexton, hence his Latin name. After several years of study at the University of Uppsala he set out on the Grand Tour of Europe, which was financed by three bourgeoisie of G√§vle by 200 Swedish riks-tollars per annum for period of three years. First he entered University of Helmstedt. Later Campanius entered a special papal seminary () called in at University of Olomouc in 1605. Companius complained that his Jesuit instructors in Olomouc were as eager to procure converts to their religion \\"as the Devil to pursue the soul\\". But despite this he really did enjoy his philosophy lectures because of the high standard and of proficiency with which the subject was taught. After completing study in Olomouc, Campanius entered Jesuit College in Braunsberg, however during one of disputes his friend struck a blow on the mouth of one of the Jesuits and they were forced to flee the town. Campanius came back to study in Olomouc, however he became ill there and spent all his money on medical bills. After leaving Olomouc, he spent some time among exiled Swedes in Poland, where he gained support of King Sigismund III Vasa in years 1616‚Äì17. Later he returned to Sweden, managed to hide his Catholic background and secretly reconverted to Protestantism. He even became a rector of a school in Enk√∂ping; according to different sources it was either a grammar school, Gymnasium (school) or a college. In 1622 he took his Master of Arts degree in Uppsala and also presided a disputation in Philosophy of Olaus Unonis Gavelius at Uppsala University. He was charged of being a Catholic during inquisition in 1624. He never admitted that he had been a Roman Catholic during his interrogation, however he admitted that he had had his period of doubts. The first clerical court decided to temporary deprive him of his office until his case had been scrutinized by the judges of the Svea Court of Appeal. The trial before Svea Court of Appeal took place during the third and last week of July 1624. Campanius was again accused of being a Roman Catholic, seducing his students to become Catholics or even Jesuits by inducing them to complete their education abroad at Jesuit institutions and of collaboration with the arch-enemies of Sweden (i.e. emigrants in Poland under leadership of the former king of Sweden Sigismund III.) Campanius spoke very highly of Jesuit tuition methods. On 31 July 1624 he was sentenced to death and executed. Presumably his head was struck of shoulders and placed on a stake as a warning to the general population, as was the custom in Sweden at the time.

Crime in Germany is combated by the German Police and other agencies. Recent trends = Statistics = The official statistics PKS 2018 of 2018 by the Bundeskriminalamt for the year 2017 shows an increase of 39.9% for resistance and attacks against state authority, 13.6% in the spreading of pornographic material, 8.3% in crimes against the german drug law, 6.1% for narcotic- related crimes generally and 5.5% in violations of the german arms law. On the other hand, there is a decrease by 18.2% in sexual assault, rape, sexual harassment including cases with lethal consequences, 16.3% in burglaries, 9.3% in violations of the immigration laws, 7.6% in fraud, 7.5% in theft and 6% in street crime. = European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) = In the EU-SILC survey, respondents were questioned about whether they experienced problems with violence, crime, or vandalism in the area where they live. Between 2010 and 2017, the EU crime average dropped by 3%. All countries in the EU except Germany, Sweden, and Lithuania showed a falling trend of criminal incidents. By type According to Germany's 2010 crime statistics, 5.93 million criminal acts were committed, which was 2% lower than in 2009.Crime rate drops to record low, Deutsche Welle. Retrieved June 2011 According to the Interior Ministry, this was the first time the figure had fallen below six million offenses since 1991 (the year after reunification), and is the lowest crime level since records began. The rate of crimes solved in 2010 was 56%, a record high from 2009's 55.6%. In 2010, internet-related crime climbed 8.1%, with around 224,000 reported cases. The number of house burglaries in 2010 also increased by 6.6%. = Domestic violence = According to 2015 statistics, there were 127,000 victims of domestic violence. (German: H√§usliche Gewalt) 82% of the victims were female. This represented an increase of 5.5% over 2012 statistics. The most commonly reported crime was bodily harm, defined as a slap or a strike of sufficient force to warrant prosecution. Other common crimes were threats (14.4%), grievous bodily harm (German: schwere K√∂rperverletzung), and injury with a deadly outcome (German: Verletzung mit Todesfolge) at 12%. A fourth of the suspects were reported to be intoxicated from the consumption of alcohol. Ex-partner victims were mostly targeted by stalking. =Murder= In 2016, Germany had a murder rate of 1.18 per 100,000 population. Organized crime In the 1990s, the power balance changed in the red light districts of Germany when Russian, Yugoslav, Albanian and Kurds started to operate. In parts of Germany, police asked themselves whether they had suppressed German gangs too much as the gangs that took over were foreign and more brutal gangs. In 2017, statistics suggested that German citizens constitute the largest group of suspects in organized crime trials. From 2016 to 2017, the proportion of non-German citizen organized crime suspects increased from 67.5% to 70.7%. 14.9% of the German citizens involved held different citizenship at birth. =Arab mafia= Die Welt reported in 2016 that Berlin and Bremen have significant problems with organized crime in the form of \\"Arab Families\\", of which seven to nine are criminally conspicuous and today \\"dominate the bulk of organized crime.\\" In another article, Die Welt claimed that prostitutes in the Sch√∂neberg neighborhood are controlled by one family, with German pimps paying them protection money. =Italian organized crime= The 'Ndrangheta, Camorra, and Cosa Nostra all operate in Germany. The 'Ndrangheta has the most robust presence. There are an estimated 1,200 members of the 'Ndrangheta active in Germany, mostly in the cocaine trade. Apart from the 'Ndrangheta, the Neapolitan Camorra has also infiltrated the construction industry in Germany. Five Sicilian Mafia groups are active in the country, but seem to have lost power. Italian crime groups can mostly be found in the Ruhr district and in the west of Germany. In December 2018, German police conducted an operation against the 'Ndrangheta in Germany and arrested 90 suspects for suspected drug dealing and money laundering. Forty-seven suspects were prosecuted. =Outlaw motorcycle gangs= OMCGs such as Hells Angels, Bandidos, Gremium and more recently, Satudarah and Night Wolves, are active throughout Germany. While not all members of motorcycle clubs are criminals, many are reputed to be involved in the red-light districts and the bouncer- scene, who control a large portion of the drug trade within bars and clubs. = Balkan crime gangs = People from the Balkans have strong connections to their home country where they can go underground when they want to evade police. Mafia gangs from Serbia, Kosovo, Croatia, and Albania have close-knit structures similar to those of the Arab clans. Gangs from Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia & Herzegovina have a strong tendency to use violence and according to police, are not discouraged by ordinary police as they have fought in the Yugoslav Wars. A number of these gangsters are ex-special forces who served under warlords during the wars in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo. Gangs from the Balkans are active in illegal gambling, protection rackets, narcotics trade and human trafficking. The Yugoslav wars also mean these gangs have access to firearms, where 700 thousand weapons were stolen in Albania alone. Albanian mafia Albanian mafia families are active in some of the German urban centers, in particular Hamburg. They play an important role in the drug trade and the red light districts of the country. \\"Ethnic Albanians\\" (as the German police officially calls them), who come into Germany typically from Albania or the Republic of Macedonia or Kosovo, have created for a very short time in the last decade, a very powerful criminal network, says Manfred Quedzuweit, director of the Police Department for Fighting the Organized Crime in Hamburg. \\"Here, it could be heard that they are even more dangerous than Cosa Nostra. Albanian \\"banks\\" in Germany are a special story. They are used for transferring money from Germany, which amounts to one billion Euros a year. One of these banks was discovered by accident by the D√ºsseldorf police while checking a travel agency \\"Eulinda\\" owned by the Albanians. \\"We haven't found a single travel-related catalog or brochure at the agency. The computers were nonfunctional, the printer had never been used. We found that \\"Eulinda\\" was a coverup for some other business\\", said high criminal counselor from D√ºsseldorf Rainer Bruckert. \\"Eventually we found out that \\"Eulinda\\" had already transferred $150 million to Kosovo‚Äîfor 'humanitarian purposes'\\", says Bruckert. \\"Money was being transferred by the couriers in special waist belts with multiple pockets. So, in a single one-way trip, it was possible to carry up to six million D-marks.\\" BND reports state that Albanian mafia activities are thoroughly spread throughout Germany. One mafia family in Hamburg, for instance, according to BND reports, has over \\"300 million euros in real estate portfolios\\". Further, the clan has considerable ties to police, judges, and prosecutors in Hamburg. According to British criminal Colin Blaney in his autobiography 'Undesirables', Albanian criminals in Germany also frequently come to blows with British criminals who operate in the nation. Albanian people traffickers have been involved in confrontations with an English organized crime group known as the Wide Awake Firm, including an incident in which a member of the English group was stabbed through the hand. Serbian mafia The Zemun clan is active in Germany and mainly involved in drug trafficking and prostitution. Members are largely ethnic Serbs, some of them former soldiers, but Montenegrins and Bosniaks from the Serbian region of Sandzak are part of the ex-Yugoslavian gangs as well. =Russian mafia= Russian-speaking crime groups, in particular, the Tambov gang are active in cities such as D√ºsseldorf. Money laundering, prostitution and extortion seem to be their activities of choice. Aside from the Russian groups, Georgian, Armenia and Chechen crime groups are active in Germany as well. Very often these gangs and the Russian groups are named together in one breath even when they have little to do with each other. Another major form of Russian-speaking organized crime in Germany consists of so-called criminal Aussiedler families. Aussiedlers are ethnic Germans (also called Volga Germans) that were born in the former Soviet Union. While a lot of Aussiedlers adapted well and quickly mastered the German language, a lot of families held onto the traditional lifestyle they lived in Russia and surrounding states. This led to the formation of individual as well as clan-based groups of Aussiedlers involved in organized criminal activities such as drug trafficking, extortion, prostitution, as well as extreme violence. Due to a large number of Aussiedlers they are seen as the major form of Russian organized crime in Germany. =Turkish mafia= Turkish crime groups which consist of ethnic Turks, Laz and Kurds from Turkey are active throughout Germany in extortion, weapon trafficking and drug trafficking. Often the gangs can be linked to political groups from their home country, such as the Grey Wolves for right- wing Turks and Dev Sol for left-wing Turks and Kurds. In 2014, the annual report on organized crime presented in Berlin by interior minister Thomas de Maizi√®re, showed that there were 57 Turkish and 4 Kurdish gangs in Germany. According to the report, alongside their more traditional fields of drug smuggling, gangs are also increasingly turning their attention to burglary, car theft, and fraud. 10% of Germany's gang members were reported to be Turkish and according to statistics, the activity of Turkish gangs in Germany had decreased. In 2016, Die Welt and Bild reported that the new Turkish motorbike gang, Osmanien Germania, was growing rapidly. The Hannoversche Allgemeine newspaper claimed that the Osmanien Germania was advancing more and more into the red-light districts, which increases the likelihood of a bloody territorial battle with established gangs like the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club and the Mongols Motorcycle Club. =Middle Eastern crime clans= Middle Eastern crime clans have become a major player in the underworld of Germany since the mass emigration of large Middle Eastern families, also called Gro√üfamilie. Especially in cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, and Bremen Middle Eastern clans are highly active in heroin trafficking as well as being involved in the bouncer-scene. Middle Eastern crime families mostly have origins in Lebanon, Afghanistan (mainly in Hamburg) and Morocco (mostly in Frankfurt). Middle Eastern crime clans come from different backgrounds, but the most numerous of them are the Lebanese Mhallami clans such as the Al-Zein Clan and the Miri clan among others. According to a research conducted by the Abba Eban Institute as part of an initiative called Janus Initiative, Hezbollah has built up its own international drug trafficking and money laundering network, with mafia-like structures. The research is focusing on the ties between organized crime and Hezbollah and found clans in Germany that are specifically supporting Hezbollah. According to the Abba Eban Institute, members of the three Shiite extended families Chahrour, Berjawi and Balhas are based in Berlin and North Rhine-Westphalia, and are deeply involved in drug trafficking and money laundering.Al-Kuds-Marsch in Berlin Die Clans, die Hisbollah und die schmutzigen Gesch√§fte, Berliner Zeitung, June 1, 2019  Lebanese gangs  Lebanese clans are active in drug trafficking, including Afghan heroin, cocaine, hashish and methamphetamine, weapon trafficking, extortion, prostitution and loan sharking. The main center of Lebanese organized crime in Germany is Berlin, with other clans spread throughout Bremen and Essen.  Afghan gangs  Afghan clans (often of Pashtun background) are active in Hamburg, a city with a large Afghan population. Like the Turkish and Turkish-Kurdish as well as Albanian gangs in the city, Afghan organized crime is active in hashish and heroin trafficking, extortion and prostitution. = North Africans = Moroccan organized crime groups, often of Riffian descent, on the other hand, have been reported in Frankfurt. Next to the Serbian mafia and Balkan gangs, the Moroccan organized crime has become one of the active main players in the Frankfurt underworld for heroin trade as well as other criminal activities. As of 2018, there had been many incidents of young male North African asylum seekers committing rapes and robberies.https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:4gN2BGw0PxwJ:https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-01-03/germany- must-come-to-terms-with-refugee-crime+&cd;=13&hl;=en&ct;=clnk‚â∑=in =Vietnamese crime groups= Vietnamese groups active in human trafficking and cigarette smuggling have been reported in Germany. Chinese Triads on the other hand have also been reported but don't seem to have substantial power in Germany.  Corruption  Transparency International‚Äôs Global corruption barometer 2013 revealed that political parties and businesses are the most corrupt institutions in Germany. The same report also indicated that petty corruption is not as uncommon as other European countries. The survey showed that 11% of the respondents claim to have been asked to pay a bribe at one point in their life and only a few of those said that they had refused to pay the bribe. By nationality In 2018, the Wall Street Journal analyzed German crime statistics for crime suspects and found that the foreigners, overall 12.8% of the population, make up a disproportionate share of crime suspects (34.7%), see horizontal bar chart. In 2016, 31.4% of all convicted offenders were foreigners, about 3 times higher than the percentage of foreigners living in Germany. According to the Huntington Post in February 2018, out of each of the 15 state justice ministries, 12,300 Muslims are in prison. This constitutes about 20% of the 65,000 prison population in Germany, proving to be an over-representation. The highest shares are in city states of Bremen (29%), Hamburg (28%) but the share is high also in large states such as Hessen (26%) Baden-W√ºrttemberg (26%). The share is lower in the former East Germany. In 2018, the interior ministry published an analysis of the Federal Police Statistic (PKS) for the first time, which included all the people who came via the asylum system into Germany. The report found that the group defined as immigrants, which constitutes 2% of the total population, makes up 8.5% of all crime suspects.  By location  Crimes such as drug trafficking, weapon trafficking, extortion, prostitution, money laundering and contract killing are mostly present in poorly maintained areas of urban centers such as Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Hannover, Duisburg, Cologne or D√ºsseldorf.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Wigan, the archdeaconry of Wigan & West Lancashire, and the diocese of Liverpool. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History The foundation stone was laid on 1 September 1863. The church took three years to build and was consecrated on 15 September 1866. It was the centrepiece of a workers' industrial village, and was paid for by James C. Eckersley, a local colliery proprietor, MP for Wigan, and member of a mill-owning family. The estimate for the cost of its building was over ¬£15,000 (). It was designed by the Lancaster architect E. G. Paley. In 1970 the neighbouring Church of St Thomas closed, and the two parishes merged. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in sandstone from Parbold. The roofs are slated. Its architectural style is Decorated. The plan consists of a five-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a south porch, a two-bay chancel with a chapel to the south and a vestry to the north, and a west tower. The tower is large, in five stages, with angle buttresses rising to the fourth stage. In the bottom stage is a west arched doorway containing double doors, over which is a four-light window. In the third stage is a crocketted niche containing the date 1866 on the west side and two-light windows on the north and south sides. The fourth stage has clock faces, and the top stage contains pairs of two-light gabled and louvred bell openings on each side. At the summit is a frieze decorated with ball flowers under a pierced parapet with crocketted pinnacles. The parapets of the naves and aisles are battlemented, with pierced triangular upstands between the bays. At the east end of the nave are crocketted pinnacles. The two-light clerestory windows are in pairs, and along the aisles are three-light windows. The chancel is at a lower level and has a parapet of pierced trefoils. On its south side, the first bay contains a chapel with a rose window on the south side, and two-light windows on the sides. In the second bays is a three-light window. The east window is large, and has five lights. =Interior= The arcades are carried on alternate octagonal and quatrefoil columns. The paired clerestory windows have detached marble shafts. The stone reredos is ornate. Below the east window is an arcade, and on each side of the window are two tiers of niches containing statues. The south chapel contains furnishings moved from St Thomas' Church. The north and south chancel windows contain stained glass by Hardman. The two-manual organ was made in 1865‚Äì66 by Hill and Son at a cost of ¬£375 (). It is thought that the organ case was designed by Paley. There is a ring of eight bells, all cast in 1896 by Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry.

The existing random early detection (RED) algorithm and its variants are found vulnerable to emerging attacks, especially the Low-rate Denial-of-Service attacks (LDoS). Experiments have confirmed that the existing RED-like algorithms are notably vulnerable under LDoS attacks due to the oscillating TCP queue size caused by the attacks. The Robust RED (RRED) algorithm was proposed to improve the TCP throughput against LDoS attacks. The basic idea behind the RRED is to detect and filter out attack packets before a normal RED algorithm is applied to incoming flows. RRED algorithm can significantly improve the performance of TCP under Low-rate denial-of-service attacks. The design of Robust RED (RRED) A detection and filter block is added in front of a regular RED block on a router. The basic idea behind the RRED is to detect and filter out LDoS attack packets from incoming flows before they feed to the RED algorithm. How to distinguish an attacking packet from normal TCP packets is critical in the RRED design. Within a benign TCP flow, the sender will delay sending new packets if loss is detected (e.g., a packet is dropped). Consequently, a packet is suspected to be an attacking packet if it is sent within a short-range after a packet is dropped. This is the basic idea of the detection algorithm of Robust RED (RRED).

The AQM&DoS; Simulation Platform is able to simulate a variety of DoS attacks (Distributed DoS, Spoofing DoS, Low-rate DoS, etc.) and active queue management (AQM) algorithms (RED, RRED, SFB, etc.).

Design and development In 1929 using experience from the production of licence-built aircraft the company built the CASA III. It was originally designed as a light bomber monoplane for the Aeron√°utica Naval air arm of the Spanish Navy, but since its performance was poor the prototypes were used as touring aircraft, ending up as trainers at Pollensa¬¥s Naval Air School. The CASA III was a parasol wing monoplane with a fabric-covered steel tube fuselage. It had two tandem open cockpits and wide track fixed conventional landing gear with a tail skid. The wings were hinged at the rear spar and they could be folded for storage or transport. The M-CAGG registered prototype first flew on 2 July 1929 and was powered by a Cirrus III piston engine. Within a few weeks the aircraft took part in a handicap air race between Madrid and Burgos and on 25 December 1929 it became the first light aircraft to land in the Canary Islands. The second aircraft was fitted with a Isotta Fraschini Asso 80A engine but it was not a success. In 1930 three CASA III aircraft entered the 1930 Aerial Tour of Europe, but only two actually competed; the prototype which retired with a broken landing gear, and the de Havilland Gipsy I powered third-aircraft (M-CMAM) which arrived too late for the start although it completed the course. A total of nine aircraft were built, all with different engines, including the de Havilland Gipsy III and the Elizalde A6 radial engine. The last aircraft built was delivered to the Spanish Navy. Suitable power plants included:- de Havilland Gipsy I, de Havilland Gipsy II, de Havilland Gipsy III, Isotta Fraschini Asso 80 R., Lorraine 5P, Walter Venus and Elizalde D V.

It was formed on 4 March 1936 at RCAF Station Trenton as a Torpedo Bomber squadron before moving to RCAF Station Jericho Beach in 1938. During the war it was primarily used in an anti-submarine role with Western Air Command, flying from Jericho Beach and Coal Harbour. The squadron flew the Blackburn Shark, Supermarine Stranraer, Consolidated Canso and Consolidated Catalina before disbanding on 7 August 1945.  History  = Formation and prewar service = A Blackburn Shark at Rockcliffe destined for No. 6 Squadron, 1936 No. 6 Squadron was authorized as a Torpedo Bomber unit on 4 March 1936 at the RCAF main training base in Trenton, Ontario, under the control of RCAF headquarters. It began service training with Canadian Vickers Vedette flying boats before receiving Blackburn Shark torpedo bombers from England in January 1937. Flight Lieutenant C.L. Trecarten became commander on 23 November 1936; subsequent prewar commanders were RAF Flight Lieutenant E.A. Springall from 18 February 1938, and Wing Commander A.H. Hull from 13 June of the latter year. In November 1938 it relocated to Jericho Beach, British Columbia, joining Western Air Command there on 5 November after departing Trenton on the first day of the month. The squadron trained in torpedo dropping at Jericho Beach. = Second World War = It was mobilized for the Second World War on 10 September 1939, and flew its first mission on the next day ‚Äì a patrol of the Strait of Georgia area from Gabriola Island to the Pender Islands. These patrols, which had been begun by the RCAF on 2 September, were to identify and report all shipping transiting the Vancouver area. Between 12 September 1939 and 1 May 1940 the squadron detached two aircraft to Ucluelet. It was redesignated as a bomber reconnaissance squadron on 31 October 1939, and flew anti-submarine patrols for the rest of the war. Squadron Leader L.E. Wray replaced Hull on 4 February 1940; subsequent wartime commanders were Squadron Leaders M.G. Doyle from 6 November, B.N. Harrop from 25 August 1941, H.J. Winny OBE from 1 April 1942, G.C. Upson from 25 August, V.A. Margetts from 14 December, and L.A. Harling from 22 September 1943. Its last commander was Wing Commander A.C. Neale AFC from 20 September 1944. The squadron relocated to Alliford Bay on 15 May 1940, and during the year received at least three Noorduyn Norseman floatplane utility aircraft. After receiving Supermarine Stranraer flying boats in November 1941, it gave up its Sharks and Norsemans in December of that year. The squadron came under the control of the newly formed No. 4 Group RCAF on 16 June 1942 and reverted to Western Air Command on 1 April 1944 when the latter was abolished. Between 19 November and 3 December 1942 the squadron relocated to Bella Bella for a movement exercise. The Stanraers were replaced by the Consolidated Canso A between April and May 1943. In September of that year it received Consolidated Catalina IB and IIIAs, giving up its Cansos in November. The squadron again received Cansos in March 1944, operating these and the Catalinas for the rest of its existence. The squadron relocated to Coal Harbour on 23 April 1944, remaining there for the rest of its existence. On 12 March 1945, the Canso crew of Flight Lieutenant Moodie sighted a partially deflated Japanese fire balloon over Rupert Inlet, and forced it down on the south side of Rupert Arm by flying above it. The balloon was subsequently recovered by a ground party and sent to Western Air Command headquarters for inspection. As the war drew to a close, the squadron was disbanded on 7 August after flying its last patrol on 1 August. The squadron flew 2,506 sorties during the war, and had a total of 11,716 operational flying hours and 10,565 non-operational flying hours. Its only losses were two aircraft and nine aircrew killed in non-operational incidents. None of its personnel received decorations. It earned the battle honour Pacific Coast 1941-1945, but was never awarded it due to its disbandment.

They were particularly noticeable among opponents of Spain's Second Republic (1931-1939) - most significantly of the liberal and socialist governments of 1931-1933 and 1936 until the start of the Spanish Civil War. The opposition press and groups tended to fall into one of the categories, which would both hold sway during the period of the Republic. Accidentalists believed that the faults of the Republic (and other types of government, like the preceding monarchy) were not based in the institution itself, but rather in the way it was being run. There was no fundamental flaw, and so means to improve Spain could be taken within the framework of the current system. The acts of a particular government were the only important thing. It was associated with legalism.Preston (2006), p. 43. Catastrophists believed that the problems with the Republic ran deep. This led them to conclude it should be overthrown, and replaced with another system - exactly what depended on the nature of the catastrophist group. Ultimately, the Spanish coup of July 1936 would represent a catastrophist insurrection, and would start the civil war.Preston (2006). p. 44. There were three main groups of catastrophists: the Carlists, the Alfonsine monarchists and the Spanish version of fascists: the Falange. The Carlists were the monarchist supporters of the claim of Infante Carlos and his descendants, with a militia called the Requet√©. The Alfonsine monarchists, who gathered around Renovaci√≥n Espa√±ola, wanted a return to the military government of General Primo de Rivera and the monarchy, and ran the journal Acci√≥n Espa√±ola. The fascists, were embodied from 1933 by the Falange.Preston (2006), p. 45. Of the three groups, the Alfonsine monarchists were the best financed and most influential; the fascists created the most disorder. The Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right's (CEDA) victory in the elections of 1933 was seen as a triumph for democratic means, and accidentalist opposition to the previous government. Catastrophic opposition was eclipsed temporarily, but continued to wait in the wings.Preston (2006), p. 69. In contrast, the elections in 1936, when the political right was beaten by the Popular Front, represented the futility of the accidentalist approach, and heralded the start of a period where opposition was mostly catastrophic in nature.Preston (2006), p. 83. After the election Jos√© Calvo Sotelo became the leading speaker of the anti-revolutionary right in the Parliament, preparing the mood of the right wing masses for a coup d'√©tat. The culmination of the 1936 coup resulted in the start of the civil war, which would be considered a success of catastrophism.Preston (2006), p. 321.

Mthwakazi is widely used to refer to inhabitants of Matebeleland Province in Zimbabwe.Mthwakazi Foundation Inc. Retrieved 2012-08-09. Etymology The word Matabele is an anglicised term that was used by the British, a spelling that is still common in older texts, because they found it difficult to pronounce the word amaNdebele. Moreover, in the early 19th century, the Ndebele lived in territories populated by Sotho-Tswana peoples who used the plural prefix \\"ma\\" for certain types of unfamiliar people or the Nguni prefix \\"ama,\\" so the British explorers, who were first informed of the existence of the kingdom by Sotho-Tswana communities they encountered on the trip north, would have been presented with two variations of the name, first, the Sotho- Tswana pronunciation (maTebele, or Matabele) and second, the Ndebele pronunciation (Ndebele or amaNdebele). They are now commonly known as the \\"Ndebele\\" or \\"amaNdebele\\" under Zimbabwean rule (but were officially known as the Matabele under British ruleOfficial Yearbook of the Colony of Southern Rhodesia, 1924). Background The word Mthwakazi was derived from the name of Queen MuThwa, the first ruler of Mthwakazi territory. The Muthwa pseudo- dynasty survived up to around the 18th century. She was the matriarch of the abaThwa, the San people. With the arrival of Bantu people, Mthwakazi territory became, increasingly, a center of diverse cultures. These local groups maintained their local autonomy, however, boundaries were fluid and intermarriages were common. The later arrival of the Nguni peoples, in the late 18th century and early 19th century, saw the inter-cultural society of Mthwakazi evolving into a sovereign state that was recognised by both neighbouring African states and foreign (European) powers. Mthwakazi has a long history of diverse cultures and arts. Imbongi (poets) began poetically describing the wonderful social structure of Mthwakazi with references like \\"uMbuthwa okazi\\" (the great collective union), which when speaking sounds like Mthwakazi. Mzilikazi is said to have marveled at the great diverse and collective union saying \\"Saze sabasihle isizwe sakoMthwakazi, uMbuthwa okazi!, undlela zimhlophe!, njenginsimu yamaluba\\", loosely translated as: \\"O, how beautiful, great and diverse the union is. It is like a garden of flowers\\". Several peace treaties, marking the borders of Mthwakazi, were signed and Mthwakazi existed as a sovereign state. However, the colonial powers, occupying the eastern neighboring state at the time (British Mashonaland Protectorate), later disregarded these agreements and invaded Mthwakazi on 3 November 1893. Mthwakazi fought a bitter defensive battle at Gadade, Mbembesi, but was overpowered by the enemy which used an arsenal of arms which were technologically more advanced than that of Mthwakazi warriors, hence lost and so began a long period of occupation and rule by conquest. Mzilikazi's settlement in Mthwakazi In 1839, Mzilikazi and his people finally settled north of Ramaquabane River, the south western region of what in 1980 became Zimbabwe. Mzilikazi, contrary to propaganda in Zimbabwean history books, did not conquer Mthwakazi nor did he establish Mthwakazi. In fact, Mthwakazi existed as a highly devolved state with a pseudodynasty of the abaThwa (the MuThwa maternal dynasty). It was led at the time by the Mambo of the Kalanga and included many chieftainships of the Tonga, Sotho, Venda, Nambya, Kalanga, Karanga and others. Mzilikazi negotiated to settle in Mthwakazi and this gentleman's agreement is what led to the understanding that: UMthwakazi wawubuswa ngobudlelwano bukaMambo loMzilikazi, loosely translated as Mthwakazi was governed by a coalition of Mambo and Mzilikazi. It was in the first battle with the Boers, post Mzilikazi's settlement in Mthwakazi, along the Limpopo river that the first sketchy military council was established, which included the chiefs from all over Mthwakazi territory, including notably Mambo of the Kalanga and Mzilikazi. Before Mzilikazi came in to settle in this \\"unnamed\\" land, the Portuguese were the first to arrive and they traded for ivory with the Shona groups in the Mutapa Kingdom. These Shona groups built stone structures such as khami and the great Zimbabwe ruins. The ethnics groups which were found in this \\"unnamed\\" area are the Kalanga, Venda, Xhosa, Sotho, Nambya, Tonga and the Karanga, Zezuru, Korekore, Ndau and Manyika (made up the eastern Shona dialects). The kingdom united the Kalanga tribe, the Wewuska tribe, the Ngsma tribe and the Tafaka tribe under a strong leadership . This kingdom was often attacked from the south by Vendas and Sotho, east by the Shona and west by the Tswana. His arrival was very welcomed as he gave military support to Mambo's kingdom. Ndebele children played and sang a song, \\"Kudala kwakunganje, umhlaba uyaphenduka, kwakubusa uMambo lo Mzilikazi\\" loosely translated as \\"A long time ago, it wasn't like this, Mambo and Mzilikazi ruled together.\\" One thing to point out was that there were many different tribes living in this large territory. The Kalanga people can be seen in Botswana and Zimbabwe, just like the Nambya and Tonga are both in Zambia and Zimbabwea for example. These tribes and others were assimilated by the Ndebele in Zimbabwe. A strong army was to be established, however, by virtue of Mzilikazi already having a standing army, he became by default the \\"Commander in Chief of the Armies\\" (Inkosi yamabutho) and men were enlisted to join his army. The Limpopo river was successfully defended and Mzilikazi became by default the leader of the Mthwakazi. The effects of Mthwakazian success, led by Mzilikazi in campaigns defending the Limpopo line in battles against the Boer attacks of 1847‚Äì1851, were so much that it persuaded the government of the South African Republic to sign a peace treaty in 1852. With time, due to absolute power Mzilikazi was gaining, Mthwakazi developed into a Kingdom. Mthwakazi under Lobengula's leadership Lobengula, (born c. 1836, Mosega, Transvaal [now in South Africa]‚Äîdied c. 1894, near Bulawayo, Rhodesia [now Zimbabwe]), second and last king (1870‚Äì94) of the Mthwakazi (Matabele) nation. Lobengula‚Äîthe son of the founder of the Ndebele kingdom, Mzilikazi‚Äîwas unable to prevent his kingdom from being destroyed by the British in 1893. After Mzilikazi died in September 1868, the succession of Lobengula was not accepted by Mangwane (one of Mzilikazi's older sons) and some of the izinduna (chiefs), and he succeeded to the throne only in 1870 after a period of serious civil war. Lobengula faced a rebellion in June 1870, and in 1872 he repelled an invasion by Mangwane and a pretender backed by the British in the Natal colony. Lobengula maintained Mthwakazi power over a huge section of (Zimbabwean) highveld until the Witwatersrand gold discoveries of 1886 drew attention to the gold in Mthwakazi kingdom and in the neighbouring Mashonaland. Soon after, a treaty of friendship was signed with the British in February 1888 (the Moffat Treaty), however it was distorted by the British government in order to declare the kingdom a British protectorate. In October 1888 Lobengula signed a limited mineral concession with a group of Cecil Rhodes's business associates, led by C. D. Rudd, but it too was distorted: manipulated to appear as a gold concession to his entire kingdom, in 1889 it was accepted as authentic by the British government and used to charter the British South Africa Company (BSAC). Lobengula refused the BSAC access to the areas under his control (Mthwakazi), and in 1890 the BSAC occupied the neighbouring Mashonaland. Due to constant interference and friction between the two sovereign states, a border line was agreed between the Mthwakazi and the British Mashonaland Protectorate. After British settlers failed to find much gold in Mashonaland, Leander Starr Jameson, the BSAC administrator after 1891, induced settlers and some native Mashonaland inhabitants to join an invading force against Lobengula's Mthwakazi kingdom in September 1893 with promises of gold claims, land, and cattle. To justify the invasion, false and mendacious claims were made that the Ndebele intended to attack Mashonaland. Faced with this attack as well as a simultaneous invasion by British imperial forces from the south, Lobengula left his capital, Bulawayo, and the invaders could not capture him, he disappeared in the direction of the Zambezi River. It is conventionally presumed that he died in late 1893 or early 1894; there is no certainty, however, and there were rumours that he had crossed the Zambezi and found refuge with Mpezeni's Ngoni people in North Eastern Zambia. The struggle in Mthwakazi under Rhodesia After the 1893 invasion, Mthwakazi has been ruled by conquest ever since. The existence of Mthwakazi under the \\"Rule by Conquest\\" for more than 120 years, has been perpetuated to deny Mthwakazi statehood, subjecting it to alien interest, domination, subjugation and rendering the rulers to corruptly exploit Mthwakazi's economic resources. The \\"Rule by Conquest\\" emerged as an unprovoked bloody invasion by the British South Africa Company mercenaries, and violated the 1888 Moffat Treaty of Peace and Unity. The invasion was promulgated by Britain through the Royal Charter on 29 October 1889. On 14 August 1893, at Fort Victoria in British Mashonaland Protectorate the BSA Co signed a secret contract called the Victoria Agreement pledging to give each mercenary \\"a free farm 6,000 acres with the title deed value of 9,000 sovereign pounds, 15 gold reefs, 5 gold alluviums, a share of looted cattle (600,000) one half going to the BSA Co another half being shared equal between officers and men, a share of the Kingdoms' mineral consisting of two 20 liters tins of biscuit one full of pure gold with another one full of uncut diamonds all worth 10 million sovereign pounds and a provision of forced and cheap labour of the conquered people once Mthwakazi was conquered.\\" On 18 July 1894, Britain promulgated the Matabeleland Order-in-Council, legitimizing the Victoria Agreement as the jurisdiction of ruling the Mthwakazi by conquest as well as the legal bases of the constitution of the \\"Rule by Conquest\\". Once the Matabeleland Order-in- Council was in place, the BSA Co proceeded to expropriate all the fruitful lands from the inter-cultural society of Mthwakazi, dispossessed them of 600,000 cattle and any other valuable properties, displacing people by exiling them to the inhabitable two Native Reserves where they remained poor, as forced and cheap labour. The BSA Co promptly formed the conquest government which ruled by terror, imposed deprivation situations against the people of Mthwakazi and opportunity reservations for the rulers. The conquerors promulgated harsh laws including the Masters and Servants Act and made the conditions of forced and cheap labour unbearable. The culture and the traditional education system of Mthwakazi was broken down including the crucial support system that was based on the extended families and had assisted the people to help each other during hard times such as death, famine and disasters, were broken down during displacement. The society got disorganized followed by the personality disorganization and permanent extreme poverty of the whole inter-cultural society of Mthwakazi. In 1923, Britain promulgated the constitution of Racial Domination which ruled Mthwakazi jointly with Mashonaland and made the White people the constitutional rulers while it left the inter-cultural society of Mthwakazi without franchise. The racial domination ruled with violence and detentions without trial culminating in the 1970s liberation war which further displaced the people. In 2014, the secessionists Mthwakazi Republic Party and Matabeleland Peoples Congress started a petition to allow the restoration of the Mthwakazi kingdom.

Early life He was the youngest son of Provost George Fordyce (1663‚Äì1733) of Aberdeen, and brother to David Fordyce, James Fordyce, and William Fordyce. He was educated under his uncle, Thomas Blackwell the younger, and was then for some time in the hosiery trade at Aberdeen. He went to London, and found a situation as outdoor clerk to a banker named Boldero. Eventually he became the most active partner in the firm of Neale, James, Fordyce, & Down. Banker and speculator Under his guidance the firm speculated freely, and gained by obtaining early intelligence of the signature of the preliminaries of the Peace of Paris in 1763, and when East India Company stock rose greatly in 1764‚Äì5. With the proceeds of these and other speculations Fordyce purchased an estate and built a fine house at Roehampton, where he lived magnificently. He stood as a candidate for the borough of Colchester at the general election of 1768, and spent nearly ¬£14,000; but was defeated by twenty-four votes. After this he spent money to build a hospital and otherwise cultivate the borough. In 1770 he married Lady Margaret Lindsay, second daughter of James Lindsay, 5th Earl of Balcarres. The tide of fortune then turned; Fordyce lost heavily at the beginning of 1771 in the fluctuations of the market caused by the dispute with Spain about the Falkland Islands. His partners became alarmed, but it is said he succeeded in quieting their fears by showing them a pile of bank notes which he had borrowed for the purpose for a few hours. His losses continuing, he absconded, and the bank stopped payment on 10 June 1772. Financial crash and aftermath The stoppage precipitated a crisis, after a few days, when a major panic arose in the City of London. Sir Richard Glyn and Sir Thomas Hallifax stopped payment temporarily, and a stoppage by Sir George Colebrooke came close. Fordyce, supposedly in danger from the mob, returned and went through an examination at the Guildhall. His debt was about ¬£100,000. Fordyce was again the defeated candidate at Colchester in 1780. He died 8 September 1789, at Mr. Mead's in George Street, Portman Square. A sermon by Thomas Toller, minister sharing a church with James Fordyce, published in London in 1775, describes Fordyce's fall. His widow married in 1812 Sir James Bland Burges.

In the , Middle Ridge had a population of 7,141 people. Geography Middle Ridge is located from the Toowoomba city centre. History Carl Ludwig Heuschele and his wife Anna Catherina (nee Berghofer) with family at Middle Ridge, circa 1890 Middle Ridge was named in the 1860s, as the area between East and West Creeks where the teamsters who camped at Toowoomba turned their teams loose to graze. The Shire of Middle Ridge, a local government area, existed from 1880 to 1917. The shire's centre was at the intersection of Stenner and Hume Streets () now the north-western corner of the locality of Middle Ridge where there was the shire hall, the school and a church. Between 1958 and 1961 three motor racing events took place at Middle Ridge, to coincide with the 'Carnival of the Flowers' in September. A rectangular circuit using Stenner Street-Mackenzie Street-Alderley Street- Rowbotham Street was run in an anti-clockwise direction. There have been several reasons given why racing stopped after 1961 - local farmers claimed that the races stopped their chickens laying eggs; the carnival organisers believed that loud racing engines were incompatible with flowers; or that the races were pulling spectators away from other Carnival events. Middle Ridge State School opened on 27 May 1884.  Education  Middle Ridge State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 203 Spring Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 827 students with 65 teachers (53 full-time equivalent) and 33 non-teaching staff (20 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program.

In his third start, he won an allowance race at Belmont Park in May 1926 for the second win of his career. He went on to place second in a prestigious stakes race at Belmont, running second to Draconia in the Tremont Stakes during the first week of July in his freshman season. His trainer, Fred Hopkins, wheeled him back three weeks later to a third-place finish in the Sanford Memorial Stakes at Saratoga Race Course. In the early autumn, Bostonian won another allowance race. His owners then shipped him west to run at Churchill Downs in the Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes, where he finished second to Valorous. During the winter, his connections decided to freshen him until the spring.  Three-year-old season  Bostonian got a late start to his three-year-old season, making his sophomore debut in New York's key prep race to the Derby, the Wood Memorial Stakes at a mile and one eighth at Aqueduct Racetrack.

He has had a major influence on contemporary veganism. Yourofsky was sponsored by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) between the years 2002‚Äì2005, and has given many public lectures promoting veganism. In 2010, Yourofsky's popularity quickly accelerated around the world (especially in Israel) following the release of a YouTube videoBest Speech You Will Ever Hear - Gary Yourofsky of him giving a speech at the Georgia Institute of Technology, as the video gained millions of views and has been translated into tens of different languages. Yourofsky has been admired by many, and criticized by others for his alleged extreme views. He has been arrested 13 times between the years 1997‚Äì2001, and has spent 77 days in a Canadian maximum security prison in 1999, after raiding a fur farm in Canada and releasing 1,542 minks in 1997. He is also permanently banned from entering Canada and Britain. On March 30, 2017, Yourofsky announced the end of his activist life on his Facebook page, stating: \\"My tank is completely empty, so I will no longer be online or active in any capacity besides helping students with animal rights projects and answering emails from people who are beginning their vegan journeys.\\" Personal life Yourofsky was born into a Jewish family in Detroit, Michigan, United States. He grew up in Oak Park. Yourofsky has \\"a giant tattoo of himself, wearing a mask and holding a rabbit, covering most of his right forearm.\\" In a 2013 interview, Yourofsky described himself as having been a \\"troublemaker\\" in high school. He recalled that he did not sign up for any math classes during the entire four years, in deliberate defiance of the requirements; at the end of his senior year he challenged the principal to hold him back, but she approved his graduation instead.Interview with Yourofsky ([00:20:22]) at the Israeli Educational Television station He holds a B.A. in journalism from Oakland University and a radio broadcasting degree from Specs Howard School of Media Arts. Animal rights advocacy =1996‚Äì2001: Early years as an activist= In 1996, Yourofsky founded Animals Deserve Absolute Protection Today and Tomorrow (ADAPTT), a vegan organization opposed to any usage of animals. By 2001, the organization had around 2,200 members. On March 30, 1997, Yourofsky, alongside 4 members of the Animal Liberation Front (ALF), raided a fur farm in Blenheim, Ontario, Canada, and released 1,542 mink, who were to be killed for their fur. The raid reportedly caused damage estimated at C$500,000 to the farm. He was arrested, tried, and sentenced to six months in a Canadian maximum-security prison in 1999. Out of the six months, Yourofsky spent 77 days in prison. The experience affected Yourofsky, who said \\"[he] was no more than an animal in the zoo. It wasn't pleasant\\", and that it has reinforced \\"[his] empathy and understanding of what these animals go through\\". In the fall of 2000, Yourofsky received $10,000 from PETA to fund the broadcasting of a commercial against \\"the animal slavery enterprise known as the circus\\". The commercial was broadcast 69 times on a local television channel. In 2001, Yourofsky began facing financial problems, such as credit card debt of US$30000, that curtailed his activism for three months of 2001. =2002‚Äì2005: PETA sponsorship= In early 2002, Yourofsky resigned as president of ADAPTT, due to financial troubles. A day after sending his resignation letter, he received a telephone call from Ingrid Newkirk, president of PETA, who offered him a job. Employment negotiations between the two concluded on May 20, 2002, with Yourofsky being made the organization's official national lecturer. In 2002, Yourofsky told a reporter that he would \\"unequivocally support\\" the death of medical researchers in ALF- related arson fires. In 2003, a Yourofsky lecture at East Tennessee State University was canceled as a result of an altercation. A faculty member had placed a stack of pamphlets in support of animal testing on a cart outside the lecture room. After Yourofsky saw the pamphlets, heated words were exchanged. Yourofsky grabbed the cart and propelled it, causing the pamphlets to scatter across the floor. The lecture was canceled and Yourofsky left the building. =2005‚Äìpresent: Leaving PETA and continued activism= Yourofsky was invited to give a talk on \\"Ethical Veganism\\" to a class at University of Southern Indiana on April 2, 2007. The university handbook contained a provision that outside speakers must \\"not advocate violation of any federal or state law\\", and a professor at the university presented material from Yourofsky's website that he found to be infringing that policy to the university provost, resulting in the cancellation of Yourofsky's talk. After objections from free speech advocates at the school, the policy was revised and Yourofsky gave his talk. Part of Yourofsky's well known speech on veganism was featured in the 2012 anti-speciesism movie, The Superior Human?\\"The Superior Human?\\". Official Movie Website A question and answer session after one of Yourofsky's speeches in mid-2010 Yourofsky visited Israel in September 2012 and was interviewed by Israeli television Channel 2. Lectures scheduled for Yourofsky in public schools were canceled by the Israeli Ministry of Education. Nobel Prize laureate J.M. Coetzee commented, \\"Children are naturally sensitive. They can easily be shocked and disturbed by spectacles of gross cruelty. It is therefore understandable that education authorities in Israel should be reluctant to allow animal advocates like Mr Yourofsky access to the classroom. On the other hand, there is an argument to be made that the treatment of animals by the food industry is so excessively heartless, and such an affront to natural justice, that we who by our silence tacitly consent to these outrages deserve to be shocked out of our sleep. In the long run, Mr Yourofsky may well be doing us a larger moral service by confronting us, including the most sensitive of us, by the spectacle of the crimes we participate in.\\" Yourofsky's website states that he has given 2,388 lectures to more than 60,000 people at 178 schools. =Controversies= In a 2005 interview, Yourofsky criticized the Humane Society of the United States, the strategies used by PETA, and its president, Ingrid Newkirk. Yourofsky has been criticized for using terms such as \\"concentration camps,\\" \\"concentration camp trucks,\\" and \\"Holocaust\\" in comparison to the meat and animal industry. Yourofsky has been banned from entering Canada and Britain as a result of his activism, that included freeing minks held captive for slaughter on a fur farm in Canada.

The purpose of the project was to make Sumerian literature accessible to those wishing to read or study it, and make it known to a wider public. The project was founded by Jeremy Black in 1997 and is based at the Oriental Institute of the University of Oxford in Britain. It was funded by the University along with the Leverhulme Trust and the Arts and Humanities Research Board.

An academic study on the means of proliferation of child pornography on the internet is the initial point to start a discussion based on facts and to develop specific counter-measures. The study was realised by Bernd-Dieter Meier, professor at the Kriminalwissenschaftliches Institut (Institute for Criminology) at the Leibniz University Hannover. The study was based on the analysis of court records in Lower Saxony. The study showed that the World Wide Web just plays a minor role in the proliferation of child pornography. Based on this result the initiative focuses on the effective detection of abusive material, especially to facilitate the screening work material seized by the policy. The use of signatures (so to say the digital fingerprints) of already classified abusive material plays a pivotal role the development of further solutions. These signatures are collected at the German Bundeskriminalamt (Federal Criminal Police Office) in the PERKEO-Database and are provided to investigative authorities. The further steps are deriving from the feasibility and the legal and political evaluation of the use of these signatures beyond investigative authorities, e.g. malware detection.Kinderporno-Fahndung bei allen Internetnutzern Zeit-Online December 27, 2011 Since 2010 the White IT-Symposium has been established as an interdisciplinary annual conference on the topic child of pornography and measures against it.White IT-Symposium 2012 Beh√∂rden Spiegel of November 1, 2012 With the purpose of strengthening self-assertion of children and of sensitising parents for the topic of sexual abuse, the initiative funded the \\"Pixi-Books\\", books for pre-school children and their parents, published by the Carlsen Verlag publishing house.B√ºndnis White IT pr√§sentiert Pixi-B√ºcher, Silicon.de December 2, 2011 In 2012 a book of the \\"Pixi-Wissen\\" series was edited to address older children of 9 to 13 years.Ein Pixi-Buch erkl√§rt Sch√ºlern das Internet NDR am December 12, 2012 In 2013 White IT launched an ideas competition to create other ideas to increase the self-assertion and the awareness of the dangers to children and adolescents.Description of the ideas competition on White IT's website  Study on proliferation  The first results of the study were presented November 24 and 25 2010 at a symposium in Hannover.see Netzwelt-Ticker on Spiegel-Online and Heise-Online: Keine Patentl√∂sung gegen Kinderpornografie (No patent solution against child pornography)to the symposium see. c't 2010, No. 26; Speichern, sperren, strafen - Was n√ºtzt gegen Verbreitung von Kinderpornografie (Save, block, punish - what helps against child pornography?)Auf der Suche nach den Verbreitungswegen der Kinderpornografie (Looking for the means of proliferation of child pornography) Zeit-Online of November 25th, 2010 The study itself was presented on May 2 2011 in Berlin.

They were motivated by bragging and mutual exchange among like-minded people. * A significant majority of cases were disclosed by police investigation, not by criminal complaints. * The use of undercover police officers is limited, because newcomers must contribute child pornography themselves before being accepted in these circles. This point is actually mistaken as it fails to take in legal situations other than the German one. The FBI is allowed to distribute material and has done so in sting operations for many years. In the UK the police asked the government for similar powers to distribute images and were granted them by an act of parliament in 2003. * All cases that came to court were most severe offences (levels seven through nine on the COPINE scale.

In an automated translation, the first step in order to understand the controlled language is to know what it is and to distinguish between natural language and controlled language. The main problem in machine translation is a linguistic problem. Language is ambiguous and the system tries to model a language on lexical and grammatical way. In order to solve this problem there are a lot of alternatives, e.g. a glossary related with the text‚Äôs topic can be used.  A controlled language with ten rules  Grammar rules are different for each language. Because of this, the rules for controlled languages are different from one language to another. And there are no rules that have optimal results for all languages. There are however rules which reduce ambiguities in most texts in many languages. According to Uwe Muegge's article \\"Controlled Language Optimized for Uniform Translation\\" (2002) the following ten rules should be applied:Muegge, Uwe: \\"Controlled Language Optimized for Uniform Translation (CLOUT)\\", unpublished manuscript, 2002. # Write sentences that are shorter than 25 words. #*Be brief ( well structured) #*Avoid ambiguity and subordination #*Evaluate the information #Write sentences that express only one idea. #*Simple sentences #*Avoid ( gerunds, juxtaposition, etc.) #Write the same sentence if you want to express the same content. #*Don‚Äôt be afraid to repeat #*Avoid synonyms #Write sentences that are grammatically complete. #*Sentences grammatically and Orthographic correct #*Avoid ellipsis. #Write sentences that have a simple grammatical structure. #*Avoid Juxtapostion, subordination, relative pronouns, etc. #Write sentences in the active form. #*Avoid passive voice #Write sentences that repeat the noun instead of using a pronoun. #*Avoid pronouns like it, their, etc. #Write sentences that use articles to identify nouns. #*Use the, this, etc. #Write sentences that use words from a general dictionary. #*Do not use technical words #Write sentences that use only words with correct spelling. #*Avoid mistakes  Benefits of using a controlled language  It is enabling to produce texts easier to read, more comprehensible and easier to retain, as well as with better vocabulary and style. Reasons for introducing a controlled language include: *Documents that are more readable and comprehensible improve the usability of a product. *Controlled-language guarantees giving objective and structured support in a typically rather subjective and unstructured environment. *Tools-driven controlled language environments enable the automation of many editing tasks and provide objective quality metrics for the authoring process. *More restrictive and controlled language, more uniform and standardized resulting source document and higher the match rate in a translation memory system, and the translation cost is cheaper. *A controlled language designed for machine translation will significantly improve the quality of machine-generated translation proposals and it will reduce the time and cost of human translators editing.  Controlled language and translation One of the biggest challenges facing organizations that wish to reduce the cost and time involved in their translations is the fact that even in environments that combine content management systems with translation memory technology, the percentage of un-translated segments per new document remains fairly high. While it is certainly possible to manage content on the sentence/segment level, the current best practice seems to be to chunk at the topic level. Which means that reuse occurs at a fairly high level of granularity.  References  Sources *AMORES CARREDANO, Jose Javier. Automatic translation systems[on line].

Cain suspended his campaign on December 3, 2011. Economic issues =Bank bailouts, and \\"too big to fail\\"= Cain supported the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) bank bailouts as a way to revive the economy, viewing it as an investment opportunity for the taxpayers. In a 2008 editorial, Cain wrote, \\"Owning a part of the major banks in America is not a bad thing. We could make a profit while solving a problem.\\" In May 2011 regarding his TARP support, Cain said, \\"I don't have any regrets ... I studied the situation. I didn't have trouble with the idea; I had trouble with its implementation, picking winners and losers.\\" In October 2011 Cain said he does not believe in the concept of \\"too big to fail\\" and had stated that he did not agree with the bailouts of \\"JP Morgan and the big banks on Wall Street\\". =Debt ceiling= Cain opposed increases in the debt limit for the federal government. He was quoted in a July 27, 2011, Politico article that: \\"I don't believe the debt ceiling should be raised. I don't believe the debt ceiling hadto be raised ... Those are scare tactics. Those are simply exaggerated scare tactics.\\" =Federal Reserve= Cain believed that there was no need for an audit of the Federal Reserve. Cain also commented that while such an audit is not a high priority for him, he does not object to it. He had stated that he finds it highly unlikely that anything would be found in such an audit, as the internal controls of the Fed are extensive, and that the Fed's problems stem from a politicization of the bank, rather than a failure to exercise due care for those internal controls. =Gold standard= Cain supported the Gold standard, saying that abandoning it \\"allowed Congress to inflate our currency whenever they overspent. Now look at the mess that we have.\\" =Social Security= Cain had criticized the current implementation of Social Security, describing it as a \\"scam.\\" He favored reforming the current system \\"through free market solutions.\\" Several times Cain had referenced the Chilean model of redoing social security. He supported the \\"Chilean model\\" for younger citizens while retaining the current system for current beneficiaries. =Taxes= Cain had supported shifting the tax burden from investment on to consumption. Cain had called for the elimination of taxes on capital gains, and suspending taxes on repatriated foreign profits. He also supported elimination of the estate tax; and in 2007on November 14, 2007 in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee called for the permanent repeal of that tax. Prior to his presidential campaign, Cain supported lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 to 25 percent. Cain testified in front of the House Ways and Means Committee on May 9, 2002, in support of HR 2525, which would institute a national retail sales tax. According to the Washington Times, Cain had been known as a supporter of the broad national consumption tax on retail sales called the FairTax. During his presidential campaign in 2011, Cain introduced his signature \\"9‚Äì9‚Äì9\\" plan for a 9% tax on individuals, sales, and businesses. 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 Plan The \\"centerpiece\\"Does the Herman Cain 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 tax plan have a fatal flaw?

Paul Krugman. October 15, 2011 Deductions, except charitable giving, would be eliminated. The federal sales tax would not apply to used goods. Cain also said that the 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 Plan would lift a $430 billion dead-weight burden on the economy. the 999 plan Cain stated the following summary about the 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 Plan: > Our current economic crisis calls for bold action to truly stimulate the > economy and Renew America back to its greatness.

It taxes everything once and > nothing twice. It taxes the broadest possible base at the lowest possible > rates. It is neutral with respect to savings and consumption, capital and > labor, imports and exports and whether companies pay dividends or retain > earnings. According to the analysis of Howard Gleckman the Tax Policy Center, > When you get right down to it, Cain's [9‚Äì9‚Äì9] plan is a 25 percent flat-rate > consumption tax ‚Äî not all that different from the FAIR tax that he says is > his ultimate goal.

The article also stated that Cain's final tax would be a 30% VAT, as compared to the 15% European Union value added tax.\\"Dial 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 for nonsense.\\" The Economist, October 17, 2011. The Cain plan would change the 35% corporate tax to a 9% transaction tax, which would be flat except for payroll deductions for employees in empowerment zones. 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 Plan www.hermancain.com Cain said the following about the 9% sales tax. > Unlike a state sales tax, which is an add-on tax that increases the price of > goods and services, this is a replacement tax. It replaces taxes that are > already embedded in selling prices. By replacing higher marginal rates in > the production process with lower marginal rates, marginal production costs > actually decline, which will lead to prices being the same or lower, not > higher. The 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 plan =Welfare= Cain had criticized social welfare programs in the United States, stating that, \\"Programs today are designed to make people more dependent rather than less dependent.\\"Q & A: Herman Cain on Faith, Calling, and Presidential Aspirations, Christianity Today, Interview by Trevor Persaud Social issues =Abortion= Cain identified as pro-life and opposed abortion in all cases, except where the mother's life is endangered.Three Republicans battling for spots in Georgia's likely Senate runoff  AccessNorthGa He believed that life begins at conception. He favored defunding Planned Parenthood, an organization he had referred to as \\"Planned Genocide\\" because he views it as guilty of genocide against black Americans. Cain reaffirmed his position two days after a controversial interview during which many of his opponents believed he had changed his stance. In an email to supporters, he said the following: =Affirmative action= Cain supported ensuring that minorities receive the same opportunities as non-minorities. He does not agree with a \\"quota\\" style affirmative action system, which he believed gives an advantage to minorities simply because they are a minority.Herman Cain Letter to the Editor of the Augusta Chronicle, Affirmative action is a negative step , April 28, 2004. =Homosexuality= Cain was an opponent of the legalization of marriage for same sex couples in the United States. He supported the Defense of Marriage Act. He would seek to reinstate the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy. =Islam= Cain had made a number of comments regarding American Muslims, and the hypothetical implementation of sharia law in the United States.Herman Cain: Communities have right to ban mosques, July 17, 2011. Some comments made by Cain regarding Muslims have caused controversy. He said that he was \\"uncomfortable\\" when he found that the surgeon operating on his liver and colon cancer was a Muslim. He later explained: \\"based upon the little knowledge that I have of the Muslim religion, you know, they have an objective to convert all infidels or kill them\\". He had also spoken of his distrust of another Doctor when his name \\"sounded too foreign\\", telling the audience at a Biblically themed amusement park \\"My mind immediately started thinking, wait a minute, maybe his religious persuasion is different than mine! She [the nurse] could see the look on my face and she said, 'Don't worry, Mr. Cain, he's a Christian from Lebanon'. Hallelujah! Thank God!\\" When asked in March 2011, Cain stated that he would not feel comfortable appointing a Muslim to his administration, or as a judge saying: \\"No, I will not ... There's this creeping attempt, there's this attempt, to gradually ease Shariah Law, and the Muslim faith into our government. It does not belong in our government\\" He explained that his view was in reaction to a lawsuit in which the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) sought to block the implementation of a 2008 Oklahoma law which would have denied the use of Sharia law in state courts, and a Florida judge's decision to use Sharia law to settle a dispute within a mosque, despite the Court's decision not to use ecclesiastical law in the past (see Kreshik v. St. Nicholas Cathedral), and a case in New Jersey. Cain had described his position as being \\"careful and cautious.\\" He had also argued that Muslims should be prevented from building mosques in which to teach Jihad unless they have widespread approval from the local community. Cain campaigned for Muslims to be banned from building an Islamic Center at a site in Tennessee, claiming that it was \\"an infringement and an abuse of our freedom of religion\\" and \\"just another way to try to gradually sneak Shariah law into our laws\\". Defending himself against the suggestion that this would be discrimination, during an interview he said: \\"I'm willing to take a harder look at people who might be terrorists, that's what I'm saying\\". On July 18, 2011, Cain declared that communities in the United States had the \\"right\\" to ban mosques. He justified his view by arguing that Muslims are trying to promote Shariah law within the U.S, and also that his position did not amount to \\"religious discrimination\\". CAIR said that his comments were unconstitutional and could give legitimacy to anti-Muslim bigotry. Southern Baptist Convention leader Richard Land also said that Cain had disregarded the constitutional rights of Muslims.Stephanie Samuel, Southern Baptist Leader Chides Cain for Mosque Ban Remarks , Jul. 18 2011. On July 27, 2011, Cain met with Muslim leaders at the All Dulles Area Muslim Society (ADAMS) in Sterling, Virginia. He also toured the ADAMS mosque. After the meeting, he reiterated his opposition to the use of sharia law in courts, but said, \\"I am truly sorry for any comments that may have betrayed my commitment to the U.S. Constitution and the freedom of religion guaranteed by it. Muslims, like all Americans, have the right to practice their faith freely and peacefully.\\"Herman Cain hosts meeting with Muslim leaders Herman Cain hosts meeting with Muslim leaders , July 27, 2011. Foreign policy =About foreign policy= Cain defended his foreign policy knowledge. \\"I'm not supposed to know anything about foreign policy. Just thought I'd throw that out,\\" he said to a Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reporter while on his campaign bus on Monday, the afternoon after his interview with the paper's editorial board. \\"I want to talk to commanders on the ground. Because you run for president (people say) you need to have the answer. No, you don't! No, you don't! That's not good decision- making.\\" =Cuba= Cain said he was not a fan of the \\"Wet feet, dry feet policy\\", in an interview with the television station WPLG. =Prisoner Exchanges= Cain said \\"I could see myself\\" freeing all Guantanamo detainees for one American hostage. He later abandoned this position. =Anwar al- Awlaki= \\"I don't believe that the president of the United States should order the assassination of citizens of the United States,\\" Cain said. \\"That's why we have our court system, and that's why we have our laws.\\" In a brief Q&A; with our panel after his speech, Cain told the crowd that he fully supported Barack Obama's decision to strike Anwar al-Awlaki.Herman Cain Flip- Flopped on the Killing of Anwar al-Awlaki =Libya= When asked about U.S. foreign policy toward Libya, \\"Cain repeated he would have 'assessed the [Libyan] opposition differently,' speaking in generalities about his problem- solving approach,\\" and expressing confusion regarding the issue. \\"Cain suggested on [November 18, 2011] that the Taliban were playing a role in Libya's new government.\\" =Afghanistan= Cain had been supportive of a US presence in Afghanistan, and of the War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent). =Iraq= Cain supported the Iraq War, and opposed any timetable for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, arguing it to be equivalent to surrender. =Iran= Cain favored a \\"diplomatic approach\\" to nuclear disarmament, but that the United States should be wary of the Iranian government. =Israel and Palestine= Cain supported Israel, and believed that the US should aid Israel in defending itself. After President Obama said that the starting point of negotiations for peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians should be based on the 1967 borders with mutually agreed-upon land swaps, Cain said: > I was shocked at the president's position, and I was equally shocked that he > would unilaterally suggest that Israel would move the borders back which > they acquired 44 years ago. This president threw Israel under the bus, there > is no way around it. It demonstrates once again the arrogant disregard of > this president for the opinion of the American people who like the > relationship we have with Israel, and for Israel having the right to make > its own decisions. Cain supported the Palestinian right of return under Israeli conditions. He later commented that he had not understood the question while making his initial answer, but reiterated his support for it under Israeli conditions. This led to criticism regarding his lack of foreign policy experience due to his admitted unfamiliarity with the issue and need for subsequent clarification. Cain was the only Republican presidential candidate at the former Fox News host Glenn Beck's \\"Restoring Courage\\" rally in Israel. Cain pronounced, \\"If you mess with Israel, you're messing with the USA.\\" After Vice President Joe Biden said that the Obama administration would not release Jonathan Pollard \\"over my dead body\\", Cain publicly disagreed with Biden's stance and said that as a supporter of Israel, he personally sympathizes with Pollard. However, he said he would have to review Pollard's case fully before deciding to free him. In late October 2011, Cain said that President Obama's weakness on Middle East policies was emboldening what he referred to as the \\"so-called Palestinian people\\" to seek statehood at the United Nations. =North Korea= Cain opposed any form of negotiation with North Korea, and had argued for maintaining \\"peace through strength\\". =Russia= Cain opposed the New START treaty, because he believed that the US should retain freedom to develop nuclear weapons systems. =China= Yes, they're a military threat,\\" Cain said on the PBS NewsHour, in response to a question from Judy Woodruff. \\"They've indicated that they're trying to develop nuclear capability and they want to develop more aircraft carriers like we have. So yes, we have to consider them a military threat.\\" \\"We already have superiority in terms of our military capability, and I plan to get away from making cutting our defense a priority and make investing in our military capability a priority,\\" he said. Cain addressed the gaffe in an interview with Ginni Thomas of The Daily Caller on Wednesday evening, and attempted to clarify his comments. \\"Maybe I misspoke,\\" he said. \\"What I meant was China does not have the size of the nuclear capability that we have. They do have a nuclear capability. I was talking about their total nuclear capability.\\" =Uzbekistan= Cain continued, \\"Knowing who is the head of some of these small insignificant states around the world, I don't think that is something that is critical to focusing on national security and getting this economy going. When I get ready to go visit that country, I'll know who it is, but until then, I want to focus on the big issues that we need to solve.\\" Other issues Cain in Tennessee on October 15, 2011 =2008 presidential election= In 2008, Cain initially praised Democratic candidate Barack Obama, saying of Obama that \\"His gift is the gift of oratory. That's not just the ability to speak, but the ability to connect with people.\\" He also said that he would consider supporting Obama \\"under the right circumstances\\" but only if he made a serious attempt to \\"reach across the aisle\\". Cain instead endorsed Mitt Romney in the Republican primary, and eventually supported the GOP nominee, John McCain. =Capital punishment= Cain advocates the use of capital punishment in the United States. When asked if the death penalty should be thrown away when evidence comes into question, he replied \\"No. If you do away with it, that will only brainwash people into thinking that they can do whatever they want and get away with it.\\"Tolliver, Lafe. \\"Cain‚Ä¶.Raising Cain!\\" The Toledo Journal, October 14, 2011. =Education= Cain opposes federal education schemes such as No Child Left Behind and advocates \\"unbundling\\" education, weakening the United States Department of Education in favor of state control of education. He had argued for greater performance-related pay for teachers, as well as for vouchers and charter school systems. =Energy and the environment= Cain favored offshore drilling and supported drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). He favored allowing consumers to choose alternative energy sources such as solar and wind through the private market instead of the government providing funding and incentives to particular corporations and industries. Cain's ideology on the climate represents what is termed climate change denial. He had made statements indicating a belief that anthropogenic global warming is a hoax, referring to it as \\"poppycock\\" and claiming that scientists were \\"busted\\" of having \\"manipulated the data.\\" =Health care= Cain supported repeal of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Cain, a cancer survivor, also had said that the PPACA would have killed him. Cain favored allowing the free market to play the largest role in health care. Cain supported the 2012 Ryan budget plan, which sought to privatize Medicare, describing it favorably as a \\"voucher program.\\" =Immigration= Cain believed illegal immigrants should be able to go through the traditional citizenship process but opposed what he had described as a sense of automatic \\"entitlement\\" by people here illegally. Cain was quoted as saying, \\"America can be a nation with high fences and wide open doors.\\" Cain had said he would favor erecting an electric fence on the United States ‚Äì Mexico border, saying \\"It's going to be 20 feet high. It's going to have barbed wire on the top. It's going to be electrified. And there's going to be a sign on the other side saying, 'It will kill you ‚Äî Warning.'\\" He later indicated his statement was an exaggeration as a joke. Cain supported a constitutional amendment stating that children born to illegal immigrants in the U.S. are not U.S. citizens. Cain had also said he does not support changing the Fourteenth Amendment, which states that all persons born in the U.S. and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States. =Occupy Wall Street= In October 2011, Cain described the Occupy Wall Street movement as \\"un-American\\". He further stated, \\"I don't have facts to back this up, but I happen to believe that these demonstrations are planned and orchestrated to distract from the failed policies of the Obama administration. Don't blame Wall Street, don't blame the big banks, if you don't have a job and you're not rich, blame yourself.\\" In response, fellow Republican candidate Buddy Roemer defended the protests.Herman Cain On Occupy Wall Street: ‚ÄòIf You Don‚Äôt Have A Job And You‚Äôre Not Rich, Blame Yourself!‚Äô By Alex Seitz-Wald on Oct 5, 2011 =Second Amendment= Cain believed that any concealed carry law must be dealt with at the state level and that states have the right to control gun rights. =Supreme Court justices= Cain had expressed support for Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. =Sexual harassment legislation= In the early 1990s, following the Clarence Thomas hearings, Cain as the then-CEO of Godfather's Pizza expressed concern about laws making it easier for women to sue their supervisors for sexual harassment: \\"This bill opens the door for opportunists who will use the legislation to make some money. ... I'm certainly for civil rights, but I don't know if this bill is fair because of what we'll have to spend to defend ourselves in unwarranted cases.\\" References Category:Herman Cain Cain, Herman ","title":"Political positions of Herman Cain"},{"id":"31990102","text":"The Pamunkey Indian Tribe Museum is a museum in King William, Virginia, United States, that holds information on the Pamunkey tribe, their history and way of life. The museum was built in 1979 with the aim of preserving the people's inherited identity. When it was built, the intent was to show the houses of the ancient Pamunkey. It now displays ca. 12,000 years of artifacts that represent the Pamunkey people's history from the Ice Age to the present. The museum has followed a display model combining replicas with original Native American artifacts in order to provide a full and authentic view of the tribe's lifestyle. It is mainly the work of Warren Cook, an anthropologist, and Errett Callahan, an experimental archaeologist. Callahan was mainly responsible for the replicas. He also collected many of the artifacts. The several pavilions composing the museum start with the Ice Age, and all archaeological timeframes until the present. In \\"People\\", the ornaments displayed show the way of life of the Pamunkeys at that time. Natural Environment and Settlement show the dwelling places, whereas Subsistence exhibits the tools they used and how they survived. These four themes show up in this order in each archaeological time frame, and are color-coded blue, green, yellow, and red respectively, in order to assist the visitor in moving with ease from one era to the other. The museum also hosts a gift shop where visitors can buy handcrafted items crafted by the Pamunkey tribe. In particular, pottery is made using old techniques and the clay used is dug exclusively in the Pamunkey River.

Ancient pottery from Tepe Hissar Layer III, 2300-1900 b.C. Tepe Hissar is a prehistoric site located in the village Heydarabad just south of Damghan in Semnan Province in Northeastern Iran. The site was firstly discovered in 1877 by Albert Houtum-Schindler and then investigated in 1931 and 1932 by Erich Schmidt, on behalf of the University of Pennsylvania Museum (Schmidt 1933, 1937). A surface survey was carried out in 1972, while in 1976 a re-study project was performed, utilizing modern methods of stratigraphic assessments, ceramic typological analysis and radiocarbon dating, by the University of Pennsylvania Museum, the University of Turin and Iran Center for Archaeological Research(Dyson and Howard, 1989). Other researches, rescue excavations and salvage works were done in the 1990s. The site is notable for its uninterrupted occupational history from the 5th to the 2nd millennium BCE. The quantity and elaborateness of its excavated artifacts and funerary customs position the site prominently as a cultural bridge between Mesopotamia and Central Asia. Periodisation The human occupation has been divided into three major periods (I, II and III) (Voigt and Dyson 1992). The earliest dating is uncertain but established as after 5000 BCE in the Chalcolithic period. This period (Hissar IA and IB) is characterized by mud-bricks buildings and hand-made (IA) and fine wheel-made (IB) ware, decorated with geometric, plant and animal patterns. The most widespread shapes are represented by small cups, bowls and vases. In the second period (Hissar IIA and IIB), dated to the 4th millennium BC and the beginning of the 3rd, the burnished grey ware becomes predominant and the large number of lapis lazuli beads and alabaster finds, as well as the evidence of large-scale production of copper-based alloys and lead-silver, suggests that the site was playing a very important role in the trade and export of metal artifacts and semi- precious stones from the Middle Asia quarries to Mesopotamia and Egypt. The third period of development (Hissar IIIA, IIIB and IIIC, chronologically attributed to the second half of the 3rd millennium BC and the beginning of the 2nd (Bronze Age), can be described as a proto-urban phase, mainly characterized by increased wealth, demographic concentration, mass production of plain ware and the construction of large public and ceremonial buildings. There is considerable cultural continuity from the early Cheshmeh Ali-period settlements in Iran, and into the later Hissar period. > \\"Traditionally, the early ceramic sequence of north-eastern Iran begins with > Neolithic Soft Wares (c. 6000 BC), then Djeitun wares (sixth millennium BC), > Cheshmeh Ali ‚Äúclinky‚Äù wares (c. 5300‚Äì4300? BC), and finally Hissar IA > wares.\\"R. H. Dyson Jr. and C. P. Thornton, ‚ÄúShir-i Shian and the fifth > millennium sequence of Northern Iran,‚Äù Iran 47, 2009, pp. 1‚Äì22 =Burned Building= In the Hissar IIIB period, the Burned Building is worth mentioning. It has been variously interpreted due to the richness of its contents and the presence of burned human bodies and flint arrowheads (Dyson 1972). Firstly interpreted as a fortification, the discovery of a small fire altar suggests that it may be a shrine (Dyson and Remsen 1989). Significant changes happened at the end of the 3rd millennium BC. The well-planned architecture of period Hissar IIIB was abandoned and replaced by the poorly organized structures of the Hissar IIIC period, laid out without regard to the plan of the earlier settlement. Moreover, we can mention the first appearance of truly elite burials, such as those of the so-called ‚ÄúWarriors‚Äù, the ‚ÄúPriest‚Äù and the ‚ÄúLittle Girl‚Äù (Schmidt 1933), some of them contained BMAC items such as grooved stone columns. Agriculture Painted Redware from Tepe Hissar in modern day Iran, 4000 BCE Ceramic The subsistence economy was based on agriculture. From Hissar II onward plant remains indicate ‚Äúan agricultural system based on cereals [glume and free-threshing wheats, naked and hulled barley] and the utilization of local fruit [olive, grapevine] plant resources‚Äù (Costantini and Dyson, p. 66). Lentil seeds, peas and legumes were also present. Animal (cattle, goat and sheep) figurines indicate herding activities (Mashkour 1998). In 1931-32 E.F. Schmidt recorded about eight hundred burials, of which only some have been fully described and published: 33 for the period Hissar I, 24 for Hissar II and 38 for Hissar III. Most of the graves are represented by individual burial in simple pits, with the skeleton laying on its side, in a flexed position and the skull oriented towards east and north- east. Some collective graves are attested and four rich graves of the Hissar IIIC period were found in 1931. Metal production The presence of full-time specialists seems to be attested already in the first Chalcolithic period. Regarding the metal production, already in Hissar I period, both weapons (daggers, knife blades, arrowheads) and other tools (pins, tacks, points and needles) were made. In Hissar II and III copper artifacts increase in quality and variety and include personal ornaments (earrings, pendants, bracelets, bands), tools and weapons (bidents, lances, mattocks, chisels, mace heads), and luxury items (vessels, mirrors, boxes and intricately cast pins and rods). The important site of Tureng Tepe is located in the same area of Iran, and has some parallels to Hissar. A related site of Shir Ashian Tepe is located about 20 km southwest of Hissar; it helped to clarify the chronology of Hissar.R. H. Dyson Jr. and C. P.

As of 2000, Tolleston had a population of 14,289, and was 97.5% African-American. Tolleston is primarily residential, with commercial districts along 11th and 15th Avenues. The housing stock of Tolleston consists chiefly of single-family homes, which as of 2000 had a 92% occupancy rate. The neighborhood was served by the Tolleston Branch of the Gary Public Library which is now closed and is served by the Tolleston Station post office. Distinctive subdivisions within Tolleston include Tarrytown, running for ten blocks north-to-south between Clark Road and Whitcomb Street, and Small Farms at the neighborhood's southern end. Small Farms is the site of some of Gary's most expensive homes. Tolleston Homes Tolleston was platted in 1857 by George Tolle. The Tolleston post office was established in 1860, and a Lutheran church in 1868; by 1870 the town contained approximately 80 families. The early population consisted chiefly of German immigrant farmers and railroad workers. In the late 19th century, sand mining and ice harvesting became the chief local industries. Prior to the founding of Gary in 1906, it was the principal settlement in the region, and Tolleston's Gibson Hotel was used as a base by the officials of US Steel planning the new city. Tolleston was incorporated as an independent town on September 4, 1906, to prevent annexation by Gary. It was annexed nonetheless in 1910, as a byproduct of an annexation dispute between East Chicago and Gary. As a neighborhood of Gary, it was exclusively white until the early 1950s, when legal segregation in Gary ended; it was almost entirely African-American by 1985. Tolleston Homes II Tolleston is the birthplace of astronaut Frank Borman, for whom the nearby Borman Expressway is named. Tolleston is the home of architecturally significant St. Augustine's Episcopal Church. Custom designed by renowned Modernist architect Edward D. Dart in 1958, the historically Black Episcopal church garnered two architecture awards. St. Augustine's Episcopal Church listed on the National Historic Register in 2013. It is located at the corner of Ellsworth Street and 19TH Avenue. Tolleston is also the home of St. John's (Evangelical) Lutheran Church, located on the corner of 10th Avenue and Taft St. Originally a German Lutheran congregation, St. John's has baptismal dating back to 1863 and Church Board minutes from 1870.

He was Master of the Rolls in Ireland. Background and education Temple was born in Ireland, the son of Sir William Temple, provost of Trinity College, Dublin, and his wife Martha Harrison, daughter of Robert Harrison of Derbyshire. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin and spent some time travelling abroad.Dictionary of National Biography On his return he entered the personal service of Charles I and was knighted. Legal career Temple returned to Ireland and on 31 January 1640 succeeded Sir Christopher Wandesford as Master of the Rolls in Ireland and was admitted to the Privy Council of Ireland. When the Irish Rebellion of 1641 broke out in October he served the government in provisioning the city. On 23 July 1642 he was elected Member of the Irish House of Commons for Meath, being described as of Ballycrath, County Carlow. He tended to support the Parliamentary side and in August 1643 he was suspended from his office by the Lords Justices, Sir John Borlase and Sir Henry Tichborne, acting on instructions from King Charles. He was imprisoned in Dublin Castle with Sir William Parsons, Sir Adam Loftus, and Sir Richard Meredith. The main charge against him was of writing in May and June two scandalous letters against the King, which suggested the King had favoured the rebels. After a year's imprisonment he was exchanged, and in 1645 was chosen MP for Chichester in the Long Parliament of the English House of Commons. in compensation for the harsh treatment he had undergone. He received special thanks for the services he had rendered to the English interest in Ireland at the beginning of the rebellion. Title page of \\"The Irish Rebellion,\\" authored in 1641.

History of the Irish Rebellion In 1646 Temple published his Irish Rebellion; or an history of the beginning and first progresse of the generall rebellion raised within the kingdom of Ireland upon the ‚Ä¶ 23 Oct. 1641. Together with the barbarous cruelties and bloody massacres which ensued thereupon,https://archive.org/details/nd6733699/page/n3 which created an immediate and great sensation. Its statements were received with unquestioning confidence, as the work of a professed eye-witness who could speak with authority, and did much to inflame popular indignation in Britain against the Irish.Hadfield, Andrew, Strangers to That Land:British Perceptions of Ireland from the Reformation to the Famine. Rowman & Littlefield, 1994 , (p. 15, 115). Subsequently, the truth of many of its statements have been questioned and it became viewed as a partisan pamphlet rather than an historical treatise. Temple's Irish Rebellion was often praised by authors hostile to Roman Catholicism, including John Milton \\"Almost at once government propagandists, including John Milton, imbibed Temple's prejudices and maintained that their barbarism and incivility denied the Irish individual rights and liberties\\". Ohlmeyer, Jane H. Political Thought in Seventeenth-Century Ireland: Kingdom Or Colony.

The Irish were so incensed against the book that one of the first resolutions of the Patriot Parliament of 1689 was to order it to be burnt by the common hangman. Interregnum In 1647, after peace was concluded between Ormonde and Parliament, Temple was appointed a commissioner for the government of Munster, and on 16 October 1648 was made joint commissioner with Sir William Parsons for the administration of the Great Seal of Ireland. However, he voted with the majority on 5 December 1648 in favour of the proposed compromise with King Charles, and was excluded from Parliament under Pride's Purge. For the next four years he took no part in public affairs, living quietly in London. As a result of his personal experience of the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion, Temple was appointed on 21 November 1653 as a commissioner \\"to consider and advise from time to time how the titles of the Irish and others to any estate in Ireland, and likewise their delinquency according to their respective qualifications, might be put in the most speedy and exact way of adjudication consistent with justice.\\" When this work was completed, he returned to England in 1654, and, expressed his willingness to resume the regular execution of his old office of Master of the Rolls. In June 1655, he returned to Ireland with a highly recommendatory letter in his favour from Cromwell addressed to the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Charles Fleetwood and the Council of State. He received an increased official salary, and from time to time was given several grants of money for special services rendered by him. In September 1654 he was joined with Sir R. King, Benjamin Worsley, and others in a commission for letting and setting of houses and lands belonging to the state in the counties of Dublin, Kildare, and Carlow, and on 13 June 1656 he was appointed a commissioner for determining all differences among the adventurers concerning lands, etc. In recompense for his services he received on 6 July 1658 a grant of two leases for twenty-one years, the one comprising the town and lands of Moyle, Castletown, Park, etc., adjoining the town of Carlow, amounting to about 1,490 acres, in part afterwards confirmed to him under the Act of Settlement 1662 on 18 June 1666; the other of certain lands in the barony of Balrothery West, Co. Dublin, to which were added those of Lispoble (or Lispopple) in the same county on 30 March 1659 for a similar term of years. He obtained license to go to England for a whole year or more on 21 April 1659. Restoration At the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, Temple was confirmed in his office of Master of the Rolls, sworn a member of the Privy Council, appointed a trustee for the '49 officers, and on 4 May 1661 was elected, with his eldest son Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet, to represent Carlow County in Parliament. On 6 May he obtained for the payment of a fine of ¬£540, a reversionary lease from the queen mother Henrietta Maria of the park of Blandesby or Blansby, Pickering, Yorkshire, for a term of forty years. He received a confirmation in perpetuity of his lands in Co. Dublin, including those of Palmerstown, under the Act of Settlement on 29 July 1666; to which were added on 20 May 1669 others in counties Kilkenny, Meath, Westmeath, and Dublin. Other grants followed, including 144 acres formerly belonging to the Phoenix Park on 3 May 1672, and certain lands, fishings, etc., in and near Chapelizod on 16 November 1675. He was appointed Vice-Treasurer of Ireland in 1673.

It is signed on a cartouche which hangs from the artist's self-portrait in the center, saying Iste faciebat Ano Domini 1508 Albertus D√ºrer Aleman. History The painting was commissioned by Frederick III, Elector of Saxony for the All Saints' Church, Wittenberg. Frederick had been D√ºrer's patron since 1496. He himself chose the subject, as his collection of relics included some of the Ten thousand martyrs. The similar 1496 woodcut. D√ºrer had used the same subject for a woodcut of some ten years before, but in the new work he eliminated some macabre details such as the torture of the bishop Acacius, having his eyes stripped through a drill. This scene was replaced by a crucifixion on the right and by the presence of the bishop in chains behind it. thumb The work was repeatedly mentioned in the correspondence between the artist and Jakob Heller of Frankfurt. D√ºrer received 280 florins for it. Description The painting illustrates the legendary martyrdom of ten thousand Christian soldiers perpetrated on Mount Ararat by the King of Persia, Shapur I, by the order of the Roman emperor Hadrian or Antoninus Pius, or, according to other sources, Diocletian. D√ºrer painted numerous different martyrdom scenes within a forest with clearings and cliffs. In the foreground are crucifixions, decapitations, crushing with a hammer. The Persian King is portrayed as an Ottoman sultan, riding a horse on the right. The executioners also wear gaudy Ottoman dress. In the background are prisoners walking through to a cliff from where they are thrown down against rocks and thorny bushes, as well as scenes of fighting, stoning and hitting with huge clubs. At the center of the crowded scene, dressed in black, are two characters who walk placidly, apparently unaware of the horrors around them: one is D√ºrer's self-portrait (holding his signature), the other his friend and humanist Conrad Celtes, who had died a few months before the execution of the painting.

He was the landlord of the village of Vasilevka (now Gogolevo), Poltava oblast and descendant of Ukrainian Cossack noble families of Gogol and Lizogub. Vasili Gogol loved writing comedic stage plays in Russian as well as in Ukrainian, which were successfully put on by the famous theatre patron Dmitri Troshchinsky.  Biography  Vasili was a son of Afanasiy Demianovich Yanovsky (1739-1798) and Tatiana Semenivna Lizogub (1760-1826).

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Windermere, the archdeacon of Westmorland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. Its benefice is united with those of St Mary and St Michael, Cartmel, St Peter, Field Broughton, St John the Baptist, Flookburgh, St Paul, Grange-over-Sands, Grange Fell Church, Grange-Over-Sands, and St Paul, Lindale to form the benefice of Cartmel Peninsula. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The church was built in 1864‚Äì65 and designed by the Lancaster architect E. G. Paley. At the same time Paley designed the village school and vicarage. These were financed by Miss Mary Winfield Lambert of Boarbank Hall, who died in 1857 and bequeathed ¬£2,500 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) towards the church, ¬£1,000 for the school, and ¬£1,500 for the vicarage. Architecture St Mary's is constructed in rock-faced limestone; it has sandstone ashlar dressings, and slate roofs. The architectural style is Decorated. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave with a south aisle under a separate roof, a south porch, and a two-bay chancel with a chapel and organ loft to the north. At the west end is an octagonal bell turret surmounted by a spire-let. Internally, the arcade is carried on round piers. The font is square and plain, carried on an octagonal shaft. The pulpit is carved with corbelled triangular arches. In the east window is stained glass from 1921 by Morris & Co. The stained glass in the east window in the aisle dates from 1950 and is by Abbot and Company. Also in the aisle are two windows with a musical theme, designed by Paul G. Chapman. The two-manual organ was designed by Albert Keates, and was restored in about 1930. See also *Listed buildings in Lower Allithwaite *List of ecclesiastical works by E. G.

Gerrit Pietersz Sweelink (1566-1612) was a Dutch Golden Age painter. Biography Sweelink was born and died in Amsterdam. According to Karel van Mander he was first taught to paint by Jacob Lenartsz, a glasspainter of Amsterdam whose father was a seaman from Zandvoort. Gerrit Pietersz Sweelink in Karel van Mander's Schilder-boeck, 1604, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature He was such a good student that he was recommended to the painter Cornelis van Haarlem by Jacob Rauwaert. He was the brother of the Orpheus of Amsterdam, the organist Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, whose portrait he later painted. He lived in Antwerp many years and was in Rome for even longer. When Van Mander was writing Sweelink was living back in Amsterdam and still painting. Sweelink had taught a few good students, including a painter named \\"Govert\\" in Amsterdam, and Pieter Lastman in Italy. According to the RKD he is known for portraits and mythological and religious pieces.Gerrit Pietersz Sweelink in the RKD He possibly died in 1612, since the engraved portrait of him in the engraving by Simon Frisius for Hendrik Hondius I refers to him in the past tense.

The site presently falls within the de facto Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in Girne District. History The name Panagia Apsinthiotissa refers to Panagia, the Orthodox name for the Virgin Mary, and Absinthe, a toponym derived from the cultivation of wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) shrubs in the area. According to a local legend, the monastery was named after a wormwood bush that covered the mouth of the cave in which a monk had hidden an icon of the Virgin Mary in order to save it during the period of Byzantine Iconoclasm. Many years later, after the restoration of images, the inhabitants of the area saw a strange light shining from this point on the mountain. They found the icon and built a monastery immediately below in the name of the Virgin and the wormwood bush. The monastery was known in western medieval sources as the Abbey of Abscithi or Apinthi.Rupert Gunnis, Historic Cyprus (London, 1936, reprint ed. 1973), p. 434. J. Hackett, A History of the Orthodox Church of Cyprus (London, 1901), p. 90. Sometimes it was simply called Psithia, as in the Chronicle of Georgios Boustronios.Richard McGillivray Dawkins, The Chronicle of George Boustronious, 1456-1489 (Melbourne, 1964). The monastery was probably established in the eleventh or twelfth century as a Byzantine imperial foundation and continued to enjoy a degree of prominence in the Lusignan and Venetian periods. Leontios, the abbot in about 1222, was one of the delegates sent to report the plight of the Orthodox Church under Latin jurisdiction to the Patriarch Germanos II in the Empire of Nicaea. Neophytus, Archbishop of Cyprus, was also in Nicaea at the time, having been banished by the Latin authorities for refusing to take an oath of obedience to the Roman Pontiff.Hackett, A History of the Orthodox Church of Cyprus, pp. 89-90 and 309. Many years later, Boustronios tells us that the Queen of Cyprus worshipped at the monastery in 1486, the implication being that Panagia Apsinthiotissa was under the Roman Church.Dawkins, The Chronicle of George Boustronious, 1456-1489, p. 59. He also reports that pilgrimages were made to Apinthi and Antiphonitis on the fifteenth of August by all the people of Kyrenia.Dawkins, The Chronicle of George Boustronious, 1456-1489, p. 35. After the Ottoman conquest, the monastery became the property of the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem and subordinate to the nearby Monastery of Saint Chrysostom in Koutsoventis.

Architecture The main church of the monastery appears to have been built in the twelfth century and has a cross-in-square plan of the Byzantine type surmounted by a high dome. The narthex, on the west side, has simple Gothic rib vaulting and probably dates to the fifteenth century.Camille Enlart, L'art gothique et la renaissance en Chypre : illustr√© de 34 planches et de 421 figures (Paris, E. Leroux, 1899) Writing in 1918, George H. Everett Jeffery, described the establishment as a ruin.George H.

Recent developments After the opening of checkpoints between the two parts of Cyprus in 2003, a group of Greek and Turkish architects associated with the Cyprus Civil Engineers and Architects Association (CCEAA) and the Chamber of Cyprus Turkish Architects began listing and documenting building as a way of preserving, safeguarding and operating the religious buildings of Cyprus that were abandoned after 1974. The monastery of Panagia Apsinthiotissa is among the places documented by this bi-communal group.

Aviation played a critical role in the fighting on the Eastern Front during this period, in the battles to gain and maintain air superiority or air supremacy, to offer close air support to armies on battlefield, interdicting enemy supply lines, while supplying friendly forces. The Axis air forces were generally better equipped, trained and experienced in executing military tactics and operations. This superiority increased because of the Great Purge in the 1930s and mass expansion of Soviet air forces, which did severe damage to organisational structures. On the opening day, Axis counter-air operations succeeded in destroying 2,000 Soviet aircraft, and gaining air superiority. The success of the strike enabled the Axis to support their armies in highly successful encirclement battles in July to September 1941. Its transport fleet helped fly in vital supplies to the army when the Russian Winter weather made supply difficult on the ground. In particular, the Luftwaffe played an important role on the defensive, countering the Soviet offensive in December 1941. Despite debilitating losses, Soviet aviation also played a crucial role in stemming the invasion and allowing the Red Army to organise defences; first before Leningrad in July, then in slowing down the occupation of the Ukraine, enabling the withdrawal of industries to the Ural Mountains, in the Crimea, enabling a long-term stand at Sevastopol, and then during the defence and counter-offensive at Moscow. In the event, the Axis land and air operations failed to achieve their ultimate goal ‚Äì the defeat of the Soviet armed forces. When operations ended in December 1941, both sides had suffered heavy losses, unparalleled in the history of air warfare to this point.Wagner and Fetzer 1974, p. vi. Some 21,000 Soviet and several thousand Axis aircraft were destroyed. With its factories in the Urals, out of range from Axis medium bombers, Soviet production increased, out-stripping its enemies and enabling the country to replace its aerial losses. The Axis had vastly underestimated Soviet industrial and technical potential. In the following years, Soviet air power recovered from the Purges and losses, gradually gaining in tactical and operational competence while closing the technical gap. Background By 1941, the Axis powers were in a comfortable position after defeating the Allies in Scandinavia, Western Europe and in the Balkans (leaving the British Empire as the only significant opposition). Axis forces deployed in Europe could only be engaged in the air or at sea, while the North African Campaign was unlikely to threaten its European territories. However, by this point of the war, Germany was in dire need of raw materials and oil resources available in the Soviet Union. Adolf Hitler predicted this problem and on 18 December 1940 had issued Directive 21. It ordered the beginning of the preparations for Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the USSR.Glantz and House 1995, p. 31. On the other hand, the war with the British was far from concluded and the United States of America were supporting them, while showing an increasingly hostile attitude towards the Axis. A protracted war in the east could be disastrous, so a quick victory was essential.Plocher 1968, pp. 1, 8. The plan was to destroy the Soviet Union as a military, political and economic power, by occupying the country up to the A-A line (which fell just short of the Ural Mountains). This would yield vast resources such as oil, rare metals, industrial cities and huge populations which would work for the Third Reich as slave labourers. It would also provide enormous living space (German: Lebensraum) to the Reich and destroy what Hitler perceived to be Communism and Jewish Bolshevism (the main themes for the National Socialists since Hitler's political testament in Mein Kampf, published in 1924).Murray 1983, p. 78. His recently acquired allies (Romania, Slovakia and Finland) were to assist militarily and allow their countries to be used as a base for the German Defence Force (German: Wehrmacht) to launch its offensive.Boog 1998, pp. 398, 409, 1041-1042. Although defeated in the Battle of Britain, Germany's Air Force (German: Luftwaffe) played a vital role in the success of the German Army (German: Heer) during the Axis military campaigns against the Western Allies. For Operation Barbarossa, around 65% of the Luftwaffe would be deployed to support the rest of the Wehrmacht in defeating the Soviet Union. German offensive plan Original German plan The German plan for the USSR was to win a quick war, before Soviet superiority in numbers and industry could take effect, and before the Red Army officer corps (decimated by Joseph Stalin's Great Purge in the 1930s) could recover. The method is usually labelled Blitzkrieg, though the concept is controversial and unrelated to any specific German doctrine.Frieser 1995, p. 350: Franz Halder acknowledged that Blitzkrieg was not a pre-planned doctrine, but a method of operational improvisation driven by necessity. Barbarossa's task was to destroy as much of the Soviet military forces as possible, west of the Dnieper River in the Ukraine, in a series of encirclement operations, to prevent a Red Army retreat into the wastes of Russia. There was hope this would be enough to force a collapse of the USSR and then the Wehrmacht could \\"mop up\\" the remaining enemy forces beyond the Dniepr.Murray 1983, p. 79.Citino 2005, p. 292.Glantz and House 1995, p. 30. The Luftwaffe was essential in the kind of operations the Axis' ground forces were going to perform. In the Inter-War period, the Luftwaffe developed its communications, aircraft, training programs, and to an extent its logistics to support mobile operations. Its primary mission was not direct close air support but operational-level interdiction.Corum 1995, p. 54. This entailed attacking enemy logistics, communications and air bases. Air strikes on Soviet war-making potential were forbidden by Hitler. It made little sense to destroy industry that would soon be in Axis hands; the German High Command (German: Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, OKW) did not believe the USSR could transfer its industry to the Ural Mountains. Counter-air operations were considered more important. In order for the Heer and the Luftwaffe's bombers to operate effectively in their roles, the first task of the Axis aviation was to eliminate the Soviet Air Force and deny the enemy the means to interfere with their operations. Once this had been carried out, close air support could be rendered to the ground forces.Plocher 1968, p. 38. This had always been a core tenet of Luftwaffe doctrine.Muller 1992, pp. 7, 36. Once the A-A line had been reached, the Luftwaffe was to destroy the surviving factories in the Urals.Murray 1983, pp. 79-80 and Hooton 2010, p. 153. The Luftwaffe thus began preparations to neutralize the Military Aviation of the Workers' and Peasants Red Army (Russian: Voyenno-Vozdushnyye Sily Raboche- Krestyanskaya Krasnaya Armiya, VVS-RKKA often abbreviated to VVS).Hooton 2010, p. 153. Airborne infantry operations were considered to capture river crossings but the heavy losses during the Battle of Crete consigned the Luftwaffe's paratrooper forces to a reserve role (when deployed, it was usually for special operations).Hooton 2010, p. 154.Plocher 1968, p. 24. Strength of the Luftwaffe =Supporting industry= There was no marked increase in German production in the autumn, 1940, in preparation for this major campaign. On 15 October, General Tschersich, the Luftwaffe's chief of procurement, was basing aircraft replacement on the assumption peace with Britain would be secured, and there would be no further military operations until 1 April 1947. Either the procurement officers of the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (Air Force High Command or OKL) were unaware of Hitler's intentions, or they did not take him seriously.Brookes 2003, p. 14. and Boog 1998, p. 354. Erhard Milch, responsible for production, warned the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German High Command or OKW) that the Soviet Union could not be defeated in 1941. He called for winter preparations and increases in production in the expectation the war in the East, even if successful, would last several years.Plocher 1968, p. 6. Joseph Schmid, senior intelligence officer and Otto Hoffmann von Waldau, Luftwaffe chief of operations, were also opposed to Barbarossa. Schmid still felt the Luftwaffe could defeat Britain by attacking its industries, while Waldau argued that dissipating German air strength along a wide 'air front' was deeply irresponsible.Plocher 1968, pp. 5-6. Waldau's continuing realism and non-concealed criticism of the Luftwaffe leadership and its prosecution of the war, led him to being removed from his post in 1942.Nielsen 1968, p. 166. Milch's skepticism soon became despair. He convinced himself a war in the East would be a disaster, and did everything he could to influence G√∂ring to persuade Hitler not go ahead with Barbarossa. Initially, G√∂ring kept his word, and argued that pursuing a strategy in the Mediterranean Theatre of Operations, particularly in conjunction with the Regia Marina (Italian Navy) against Gibraltar, while weakening the British hold on the eastern Mediterranean would be the most ideal strategy. Hitler dismissed this. Hitler also dismissed the Kriegsmarine's objections that it was the British and their shipping lanes that was the main enemy.Boog 1998, pp. 333-334.Plocher 1968, p. 7. The battles in the Netherlands, Belgium, France and in the Balkans had inflicted losses the Luftwaffe had not fully replaced. By the conclusion of the Balkans campaign, the strain put on German resources and its effects on production was already showing, even before Barbarossa began.Murray 1983, pp. 76-77. The Germans had only 1,511 bombers available for operations on 21 June 1941, compared with 1,711 on 11 May 1940, two hundred fewer.Murray 1983, p. 80. While overall, the Luftwaffe had remained much the same size, it was arguably weaker in crew quality than it had been in 1939, owing to the losses it had suffered, even in successful campaigns.Buckley 1998, p. 132. The failures in production, and the fact that Barbarossa began with an inadequate number of aircraft, would lead to the Luftwaffe being severely depleted by the end of the year, and becoming increasingly ineffective, while consequently the VVS, thought destroyed in the early battles, became increasingly potent by end of 1941.Murray 1983, p. 87.Diechmann 1968, p. 159. The planning for Barbarossa went ahead, regardless of these failures, and the knowledge that experience in Western Europe had shown that while highly effective, close support operations were costly, and reserves needed to be created to replace losses.Plocher 1968, p. 10. In a document issued by the Department of the Luftwaffe General Staff on 15 November 1940, it was clear that production was barely adequate to maintain current strength, much less expansion of the Luftwaffe. It stated: > [Germany's] own [aircraft] production at best ensures maintenance of the > present strength. Expansion is impossible (either in personnel or in > material).Boog 1998, p. 354. The Luftwaffe's production problems in 1941 lay not on the dilettantism of the Nazi leadership, but with a military leadership which did not understand the difficulties in producing modern weapons in large numbers and who evinced little worry about their enemy's capabilities. Udet, who had replaced Milch in technical and production affairs, possessed neither the temperament or technical background to do the job. The Chief of the General Staff, Hans Jeschonnek, displayed little interest in non-operational matters and the requirements of production and planning. Thus operational plans and production plans were not synthesised. In the coming campaigns, with increased commitment of the Luftwaffe, production remained the same.Murray 1983, p. 100. Production had always risen in 1933 to 1937, but thereafter it was allowed to level off, and did not pick up again until 1942. From 1 September 1939 to 15 November 1941, 16 revisions of production and planning were called for and designed, but none were carried through.Nielsern 1968, p. 154. The strength of the Luftwaffe amounted to 4,389 aircraft, of which 2,598 were combat types and 1,939 were operational. The inventory amounted to 929 bombers, 793 fighters, 376 dive-bombers, 70 destroyers (Messerschmitt Bf 110s), 102 reconnaissance, and 60 ground attack aircraft, plus 200 fighters in reserve and 60 miscellaneous types. This force was spread across; 31 bomber, eight dive bomber, \\"one, one-third\\" ground attack, two twin-engine, and 19 single-engine fighter groups (Gruppen).Diechmann 1968, p. 158. Around 68 per cent of the German air strength was operational.Boog 1998, p. 372. =Operational capabilities= The Junkers Ju 87 Stuka. The primary close support weapon of the Luftwaffe in 1941. The Luftwaffe was highly effective at carrying out close support operations,Corum 1995, p. 53. in direct or indirect support of the army and at winning and maintaining air superiority. German doctrine, and experiences in the Spanish Civil War, then Europe, had developed suitable aircraft for the role, such as the Messerschmitt Bf 109, Heinkel He 111, Dornier Do 17, Junkers Ju 88 and Junkers Ju 87. Their aircrews were still highly trained, and despite attrition, still had a cadre of experienced personnel. The air-to-ground support was the best in the World at the time. Forward air controllers (Flivos) were attached to every mechanised and panzer division, to allow for accurate air support, free from friendly-fire incidents and in real time.Corum 2008, pp. 131-133 and Hooton 1997, p. 96.Andrews 1995, p. 1. The German air operations staff, at all levels, also practiced the concept of Auftragstaktik (or mission command) doctrine. It encouraged the improvisation of tactics within the framework of set operational goals and advocated by-passing some levels of command under some circumstances. The air units were told what to achieve by high echelons, but not how to do it. This form of command was encouraged at the lowest levels to maintain the initiative and operational tempo.Hayward 2008, p. 49. The form of warfare was an ad hoc style, but it allowed field commanders to dis-assemble and re-assemble command structures at Air Corps level, and commit them to a crisis, or urgent operations within a short period of time. This gave the Luftwaffe an unmatched degree of tactical and operational flexibility.Hayward 2008, p. 50. However, during the course of Barbarossa the logistical elements had been largely ignored. Chief of the General Staff, Hans Jeschonnek, since his days as chief of the operations staff, had opposed the notion that organisation, maintenance and logistics should be the responsibility of the General Staff. Instead, he proposed that the Staff be kept small and confined to operational matters. Supply and organisation were not the General Staff's concern.Corum 1997, p. 228. The lack of attention to logistical detail was apparent in German plans. Virtually no attention or organisation had been prepared for logistics in the Soviet Union. The Wehrmacht optimistically assumed that mechanised forces could advance into the country without major supply difficulties. Depending on railroad repair teams to mend the Soviet rail system, they believed they could finish the campaign after reaching Smolensk, using it as a jumping off point to capture Moscow. However, the units scheduled to repair rail communications lay at the bottom of German priorities. The ease with which the OKW assumed the Eastern campaign could be won did not take into account the enormous distances. This caused supply breakdowns and a big drop in the serviceability rates, reserves of spare parts, fuel and ammunition. This difficulty would only increase during the autumn rains, when Soviet roads were turned to quagmires. On occasion, only the transport fleet could fly in supplies to keep units operational. The Luftwaffe's operating radius was to go no deeper than Moscow, and stretched from Leningrad to Rostov-on-Don. This meant German air power was operating in a theatre of 579,150 square miles. The Luftwaffe started on a 995 miles front, which extended to 1,240 from Leningrad to Rostov, then a further 620 miles from Leningrad to Murmansk.Plocher 1968, p. 16.Brookes 2003, p. 59. =Strategic capability= Jeschonnek's view of air warfare was also flawed. He believed in the quick war. To this end he advocated throwing in all personnel, even training instructors into short but intensive campaigns. He did not believe in retaining reserves of pilots or material. He also, like Ernst Udet, head of the Technical Department, favoured dive bombers. He insisted all aircraft should have the capability, which retarded the development of capable bombers like the Heinkel He 177, by complicating the design, thus delaying development and production.Corum 1997, pp. 230-231. The lack of a heavy bomber denied the Luftwaffe the chance to hit Soviet factories in the far reaches of the Urals and at least disrupt enemy production. Strategic bombing could have been carried out during the first surprise operations in June 1941, especially on those Soviet armament works that lay within range of the He 111; near Moscow and Voronezh. However, the need for counter air and ground support operations predominated in German air thinking.Faber 1977, p. 222. Hitler demanded close air support for the army, implying at least one Air Corps should be attached to each of the three Army Groups. There were four Air Corps (or Fliegerkorps) in the Soviet Union, giving one possible reserve Corps. Had production been brought up to a level commensurate with total war in 1940 and early 1941, a reserve of one Air Corps could have been set aside for strategic operations to commence with air-land operations. The splitting of tactical and strategic air units, the later being formed into one unified air command, would have done much to clarify the problem of organisation. The Strategic air units could have been freed from ground support duties which they were not trained or equipped for, while being able to carry out strategic bombing as advocated by the late General Wever. The concept of concentrating all available forces for the army, in the decisive battle became invalid, since it was the ability of the Soviets to re- arm and rebuild, through the failure of the Axis to bomb industrial regions beyond the front, that contributed to ultimate failure of Barbarossa to win a decisive victory.Faber 1977, p. 223. It was not until the winter, 1941-42 that Jeschonnek and Hitler revisited the idea of producing a heavy bomber to hit far ranging targets. Fliegerkorps IV was finally ready for operations after the publication of the Luftwaffe study Battle against Russian Armaments Industry in November 1943. However, the project was abandoned as there was no capable aircraft.Overy 1980, p. 59. =Tactics and technical standards= In the tactical arena the Germans held significant leads against the Soviets. While the Soviets were not as primitive in aircraft design quality as believed, it was in tactical deployment, combat tactics, and training, along with accumulated experience that the Germans held qualitative superiority. In particular, the German Finger-four tactic was better and more flexible than the Vic formation adopted by the Soviets. Moreover, all German fighters possessed radios, so they could communicate with each other. Soviet aircraft lacked this, and pilots had to communicate with hand signals.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 11. Despite repeated warnings in the Winter War and Soviet‚ÄìJapanese Border Wars, little to no investment was made in signals or air-to-air communications. During the later conflict, radios were not used and were thus removed. This was mostly because Soviet radios were too heavy and affected combat performance, while the Germans developed light radios.Sterret in Cox and Gray 2002, pp. 182-183. The technical differences were enough to give the Luftwaffe the edge. The latest bomber type, the Junkers Ju 88, could outrun the main Soviet fighter, the I-16, above 3,000 metres (9,000 feet). At that altitude an I-16 could attack only if it took the Ju 88 by surprise. The SB bomber was the equal of the Bristol Blenheim, but it was largely defenceless against the German Messerschmitt Bf 109. In July 1941, waves of unescorted SBs would be shot down in large numbers in an effort to stop the German advance. The Ilyushin DB-3 bomber was both faster and better armed than the British Vickers Wellington, but again, it was still vulnerable to the Bf 109.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 13. In fighter technology, the performance capabilities were closer. The Yak 1 could compete on equal terms with the Bf 109E, while the LaGG-3 and MiG-3 were slower and less manoeuvrable. The Bf 109F held a significant flight performance advantage over Soviet fighters. In manoeuvrability terms, the Polikarpov I-153 and Polikarpov I-15 could outturn the Bf 109, while the Soviets had more experience in the use of air-to-air rockets. German Intelligence =On Soviet industry= Joseph \\"Beppo\\" Schmid, the Luftwaffe's senior intelligence officer. Before the Axis invasion of the USSR, Joseph \\"Beppo\\" Schmid, the Luftwaffe's senior intelligence officer, identified 7,300 aircraft in the VVS and long-range aviation in the western Soviet Union, when the actual figure was 7,850. However, Luftwaffe intelligence ignored the Soviet Navy with its 1,500 aircraft, as well as the air defence units (PVO), which had 1,445 aircraft. The Navy split their Western air forces between the three western fleets; 114 aircraft under the Arctic Fleet, 707 under the Baltic Red Banner Fleet, and 624 under the Black Sea Fleet. The number of aircraft that would face the Axis in the five (Leningrad, Baltic, Western, Kiev, and Odessa) border districts, out of 13 military districts in the west of the country, was 5,440 (1,688 bombers, 2,736 fighters, 336 close support aircraft, 252 reconnaissance, and 430 army-controlled) aircraft. Around 4,700 were considered to be combat aircraft, but only 2,850 were thought to be modern. Of this total, 1,360 bombers and reconnaissance aircraft and 1,490 fighters were combat-ready. Luftwaffe intelligence suggested that a ground support force of 150,000 ground- and aircrew and 15,000 pilots were available.Boog et al 1998, p. 343. The actual strength of the VVS in the western Soviet Union was 13,000 to 14,000 aircraft, as opposed to the 2,800 aircraft considered operational by the Luftwaffe. Schmid estimated that the Soviet air forces were not that strong, and that it would take a long time to build up their strength and deploy it to the western border areas.Boog 1998, p. 340. In fact, the VVS and Soviet aircraft supply was well-organised far behind the front. OKL estimated that the Soviets possessed a workforce of 250,000, 50 fuselage/airframe factories, 15 aero engine factories, 40 factories building aircraft equipment and appliances, and 100 auxiliary factories. It was believed that the purges of the 1930s had severely affected the Soviet aeronautics industry, and that the Soviet Union did not possess the ability to copy foreign models, while lacking the electrometals required to do so. They based this largely on the fact that the Soviets were importing electrometals from Germany, as part of the Nazi-Soviet pact, August 1939.Schwabedissen 1960, pp. 36-38. A report from 1938 concluded; > it seems doubtful the Soviet aircraft industry will be able to equipe the > large air forces the Soviet command is endeavouring to establish....Soviet > air power can no longer be rated as highly as it was two years ago. The Luftwaffe had little intelligence on the VVS. Heinrich Aschenbrenner, the German air attache in Moscow was one of the few in the Nazi regime able to gain any clear insight into Soviet armaments potential, as a result of a visit to six aircraft plants in the Urals in the Spring of 1941. His analysis was ignored by OKL.The Men of Barbarossa: Commanders of the German Invasion of Russia, 1941,Mitcham, Jr., Samuel W., Philadelphia: Casemate, 2009, p.36 On the whole, German views of Soviet air power were still coloured by the impressions of German engineers and officers during their collaboration with the Soviet Union in the 1920s, and the poor performance of the VVS in the Winter War and Spanish Civil War.Boog 1998, p. 337. The most serious omissions were in their underestimations related to the strategic sphere. OKL had vastly underestimated Soviet production capabilities. This reflected a lack of training of the German General Staff in strategic and economic warfare matters. Though a war of attrition and the realisation of total Soviet military potential was the worst-case scenario, it was left out of any planning considerations. The relationship between the civilian sector, Soviet air rearmament, and the morale of the Soviet people were also underestimated. Civilian requirements were considered too high for production to be efficient, and Soviet determination to restrict civilian needs in favour of the war effort was underrated. The Soviet ability to switch production to the Urals, a region which the Germans considered as underdeveloped, was critical to Soviet war materiel production. The Germans did not believe this to be possible. The Luftwaffe's assessment that the rail transport system was primitive also proved to be ill-founded. Reinforcements steadily reached the front during Barbarossa. Production itself was also underestimated. In 1939, the Soviet Union produced 2,000 more aircraft than Germany per year (Germany was producing just over 10,000). A monthly total of 3,500 to 4,000 aircraft were built by the Soviets; Schmid and Ernst Udet, the Luftwaffe's director of air armaments, gave figures of 600 per month, a serious underestimation. Production kept up with the destruction and the Axis capture of industrial regions, and surpassed German production by 3,000 in 1941, by producing 15,735 aircraft.Boog 1998, pp. 352-353. This was in part due to the German belief that the Soviets had insufficient fuel supplies, particularly oil, which would undermine Soviet armaments production. The energy resources (30 percent in the Ural-Volga region, 27 percent in Soviet Asia, and 43 percent in the Caucasus) were used to complete an enormous mechanisation program. The populations' use of fuels for lighting and general civilian needs, caused OKL to assume that the Red Army and VVS could only meet peacetime fuel allocations through restrictions. It was believed that this difficulty would continue for some time.Schwabedissen 1960, p. 41. German intelligence also had a dim view of Soviet logistical capabilities. It viewed the Soviet road and rail networks as incomplete, thus the supply of aviation fuel to the VVS on the frontline would be poor and would curtail Soviet air operations. It was also thought that the bulk of Soviet industry lay west of the Urals, and was thus vulnerable to capture anyway. Although aware that the Soviet Union intended to move 40 to 50 percent of its industry east of the Urals to continue production, the Germans viewed this plan as impossible to carry out.Boog 1998, p. 349. The Luftwaffe also vastly underestimated the Soviet ability to improvise.Boog 1998, p. 350. One of crucial failures of the Luftwaffe was to underestimate the role of civil aviation on the Soviet Union. The Germans believed that it accounted for only 12 to 15 percent of all logistical traffic, and the nature of the Soviet terrain meant that rail was relied upon to deliver around 90 percent of Soviet supplies to the front, making it the prime target. The civil air organisation was deemed too primitive and ineffective. In wartime, it would contribute significantly to supporting logistics.Schwabedissen 1960, pp. 43-45. =On Soviet field organisation= Intelligence correctly predicted that the VVS was in a state of reorganisation since April 1939, and that the restructuring was not yet complete. The OKL believed there to be 50 air divisions in reserve, and 38 air divisions and 162 regiments in the frontline. It was believed that Soviet ground attack aviation would be attached to and support the Army Fronts and strategic bomber and fighter forces would held back for air defence.Boog et al 1998, p. 342. In fact, Soviet sources indicated that 70 air divisions and five air brigades were in the front line in June 1941. Moreover, strategic bomber and fighter defence forces consisted of only 13.5 per cent of their strength and numbers 18 divisions (five fighter and 13 bomber). The ground support units made up 86.5 per cent of their force, and were contained in 63 divisions; nine bomber, 18 fighter and 34 mixed divisions. Another 25 divisions were being set up, and the number of regiments had increased by 80 per cent in the preceding two years.Boog 1998, p. 343. The German intelligence on Soviet aircraft quality was mixed. Schmid rightly deduced that the VVS was technically inferior in aircraft qualityHooton 1997, p. 94. operations and tactics, and would be on the eve of war. However, they underestimated the growth and ability of the Soviet Union to rearm with new, more capable aircraft. The OKL was completely unaware that over 2,739 aircraft including the most modern types had been produced and were in service. Although still lacking in some ways (only the I-16 and SB aircraft had self-sealing fuel tanks), 399 Yak 1, 1,309 MiG-3s, LaGG-3 fighters, 460 Pe-2 bombers and 249 IL-2 ground attack aircraft were available. The OKL had assumed that re- equipment would be slow. Intelligence also believed the Soviets had 1,200 heavy and 1,200 light anti-aircraft artillery. The Soviets actually possessed 3,329 of the former and 3000 of the later, as well as 1,500 searchlights.Boog 1998, p. 345. and Hooton 1997, p. 94. The organisation of Soviet operations was also considered poor. It was thought that the Soviet air forces did not possess communications. Only radio communications, which were operated by underskilled personnel, were operational. Communications existed with the VVS air staff, military districts, air divisions and bases, but not with the flying formations which only possessed RT and other telegraphy personnel. In critical situations it was believed radio traffic became overloaded, and the lack of airborne radio capability meant the VVS could not conduct flexible operations.Boog 1998, p. 348. The OKL's view of Soviet landing grounds was also inaccurate. The Germans considered the underdeveloped nature of the airfields and lack of installations meant that units were exposed to the elements, and could not conduct effective operations from them. The better, or first class air bases, measured in comparison to the three German grades of airbase, were thought to house command staffs and their supply administrations. What mobile airfields the Soviets maintained, were thought to be inadequate because of supply difficulties. Of the 2,000 airfields in the western Soviet Union, just 200 were considered to be of use for bomber operations. In fact, over 250 had been extended, and 164 more main bases were constructed between 8 April and 15 July 1941. Not only was this taking place, but each air regiment was given its own main field, a reserve base and an emergency landing strip. It was also, by order of the Stavka, being separated from its rear organisations. The supply centres were to be organised on the forward airfields, enabling 36 air bases to operate in the western military districts and supply between two and four air divisions. This was carried out to ensure a high state of combat readiness.Boog 1998, pp. 345, 348. =Air reconnaissance= Theodor Rowehl Extensive aerial intelligence flights were carried out on Soviet air bases after 21 September 1940. The main units involved were the high-altitude Junkers Ju 86, Heinkel He 111, and Dornier Do 217, which could fly so high as to be invulnerable to interception by Soviet fighters. In some cases, Soviet aviation was forbidden to try, as Stalin pursued a non-provocation policy. In the event, the Luftwaffe identified over 100 Soviet airfields between Murmansk and Rostov-on-Don. Around 500 flights, at altitudes of up to were carried out by Theodor Rowehl's reconnaissance group, Aufkl√§rungsgruppe Oberbefehlshaber der Luftwaffe (AufklObdL). The flights continued until 15 June 1941, with special emphasis on airfields. Despite two Ju 86s being forced to land in the Soviet Union largely intact, with exposed cameras and film, Stalin did not register any protest. In the event, the AufklObdl and its intelligence played a vital role in the overwhelming initial success in the air.Hooton 2010, p. 154 and Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 12. The PVO and VVS leadership noted the flights heralded an imminent offensive, but Stalin ordered them not to interfere. He was paranoid about provoking the Germans. But when a Deutsche Lufthansa aircraft landed in Moscow without permission, Stalin grew concerned with his air force leaders. He ordered the arrest of General Pavel Rychagov, commander of the VVS and replaced him with Pavel Zhigarev. Rychagov was tortured then executed on 28 October 1941. At this point, the VVS had 1,100 airfields in the west, but just 200 were operational. =On Soviet combat capability= The view of Soviet fighter aircraft, namely the I-16, was positive. But the rest of the VVS' aircraft were deemed obsolete. However, the view formed of Soviet flying crews and operational personnel was not good. In the German view they lacked General Staff training and operational procedure was cumbersome, though they managed to offset some weaknesses by skilful improvisation. Operations were deemed to be lacking in flexibility in attack and defence and they suffered heavy losses for it. Aircrews were considered brave and eager defending their own territory, but showed a lack of fighting spirit over enemy territory. Outstanding pilots were the exception, rather than the norm. Training of Soviet pilots in formation flying was poor, as it was in bombers. Anti- aircraft units showed increased progress but the Luftwaffe saw serious shortcomings in air-to-air and air-land communication.Boog 1998, p. 336-337.Schwabedissen 1960, p. 24. Because of the scarcity of information on the Soviet armed forces, too much reliance was placed on Russian emigres and German repatriated, especially as their attitude was one more in line with Nazi ideology; a strong belief in German cultural superiority and the National Socialist thesis of Germanic racial superiority. The view formed of the Slavic peoples, hammered into the Wehrmacht by Nazi propaganda, prevented the Luftwaffe forming a realistic judgement of Soviet air forces. Even the usually sound and objective Major General Hoffmann von Waldau, chief of the operations staff commented on the Soviets as a \\"state of most centralised executive power and below-average intelligence\\". Perhaps the best summation of German attitudes to intelligence were best summed up by the Chief of the General Staff, Hans Jeschonnek, uttered to Aschenbrenner in a bid to maintain the two country's relations while the Wehrmacht was engaged in the west; \\"Establish the best possible relations with the Soviet Union and to not bother about intelligence gathering\\".Boog 1998, p. 339. =In general= The Luftwaffe's general picture of the VVS was entirely correct in many aspects in the military field; this was later confirmed in the early stages of Barbarossa and in post-war British and American studies, and also in the Eastern Bloc. Soviet sources confirm that the VVS was in a state of reorganisation before the attack, and were retraining on modern machines which made it unready for a major conflict. The deductions about Soviet tactical-operational limitations were to a large degree, accurate. In aircraft types, equipment and training, ground organisation, supply system at the operational level, the dispersal of effort and the operational commands immobility, gave the impression of an air force with limited striking power. On the other hand, there was a systematic failure to appreciate the level of pre-war education in the Soviet military. The ability of the Soviets to improvise and compensate for disorganisation in logistics offset their failings. Extensive use of camouflage and all arms defence against air attack made the Soviets tenacious on the defensive. There was, on the German side, a failure to realise that the unfavourable ratio of Soviet air power to the vastness of territory applied even more so to the numerically weaker Luftwaffe. Soviet Air Forces =Supporting industry = Soviet aviation was heavily supported by a large industry. Hitler had forbidden air reconnaissance flights deep into the Soviet Union until shortly before the beginning of Barbarossa, and the Luftwaffe did not possess the aircraft with the range to be able to reach the Ural factories to see how vast Soviet industry was. Shortly before the invasion, German engineers were given a guided tour of Soviet industrial complexes and aircraft factories in the Urals from 7 to 16 April, and evidence of extensive production was already underway. Their reports to the OKW went unheeded.Schwabedissen 1960, p. 39. Lead engineer and military air attach√©, Oberst Heinrich Aschenbrenner, sent a stark warning that Soviet production was more sophisticated and advanced than first assumed. Hitler's reaction was to speed up preparations; \\"You see how far these people are already. We must begin immediately\\".Plocher 1968, p. 18.Hooton 1997, p. 93. Hermann G√∂ring was told by the experts, from Daimler- Benz, Henschel and Mauser that one aero engine factory in the Moscow region was six times larger than six of Germany's largest factories put together. G√∂ring was furious with the report, and dismissed it. He believed they had fallen for a Soviet bluff.Boog 1998, p. 341. Intelligence reports regarded as negative by the OKL were usually dismissed.Nielsen 1968, p. 167. In particular, Aschenbrenner listed some warnings that German intelligence had not picked up: > The consolidated report of the visit stressed among than other things: (1) > that the factories were completely independent of subsidiary part deliveries > (2) the excellently arranged work --- extending down to details [production > methods], (3) the well maintained modern machinery, and (4) the technical > manual aptitude, devotion frugality of Soviet workers. Other remarkable > features were that up to 50 per cent of the workers were women, who were > employed at work, performed [had work experience] in other countries > exclusively by highly qualified personnel, and that the finished products > were of an excellent quality. Even though it maybe assumed the best factories were shown, the conclusion may also be drawn that other Soviet factories were also capable of the same standards. Soviet industry was highly productive, and on the eve of Barbarossa, possessed at least 9,576 frontline aircraft which made it the largest air force in the World. However, its equipment, like that of the Red Army, was largely obsolescent and suffering from prolonged use. The Great Purges had also hit aircraft manufacturers, and the loss of personnel ended the Soviet lead in aircraft design and aeronautics. At least one designer was shot for a charge of sabotage on the crash of an aircraft, and many designers were sent to Gulags.Glantz and House 1995, p. 37. Indeed, the Head of the VVS, Yakov Alksnis was shot and 400 to 500 aero engineers were arrested from the Commissariat of Aviation Industry. Some 70 were shot and 100 dies in forced labour camps. The others were later put into prison workshops, and allowed to continue their work. The aviation industry was disrupted, severely, and while the damage caused was later patched up in 1941, months of idleness and disorganisation contributed to the disasters in 1941.Bailes 1976, pp. 71-72. While numerically the strongest air force in the world, the VVS was an imbalanced force in comparison to the British, Americans and Germans at the time of Barbarossa. It relied on too few established designers and an over- centralised system which produced aircraft that fell behind the standards of most powers. The VVS was also profoundly influenced by Giulio Douhet, and the theory of air power that was focused on the offensive, and bombing the enemy heartland. It was overloaded with inadequately designed bombers, which were expected to survive in combat. In 1938 production of light and strike aircraft as well as fighters was to be cut in two to allow for more bomber aircraft to be produced.Bailes 1976, pp. 75-76. =Training, equipment and purges= The purges affected the leadership of the VVS. In June 1941, 91 per cent of major formation leaders had been in place for just six months. With the exception of Major General Aleksandr Novikov, commanding the Leningrad District, most would fail in their posts and pay for that failure with their lives. A critical operational omission of the VVS was the failure to disperse its aircraft. Soviet aircraft was left closely 'bunched' into groups, and lined up on airfields, making a very easy target for the Germans.Hooton 2010, p. 155. Soviet training left much to be desired. Stalin's purges had deprived the VVS of its senior and best commanders. It heralded a debilitating decline in military effectiveness. In the event of the Winter War and the German victory in the French Campaign, the Soviet leadership panicked and Stalin ordered a hasty overhaul of the armed forces. Order 0362, 22 December 1940, of the People's Commissar Defence ordered the accelerated training program for pilots which meant the cutting of training time. The program had already been cut owing to an earlier defence order, 008, dated 14 March 1940. It put an end to the flight training for volunteers, and instituted mass drafts. In February 1941, pilot training was cut further leading to a disastrous drop in the quality of pilot training prior to Barbarossa. The officer corps was decimated in the Great Purge and operational level effectiveness suffered. The 6,000 officers lost and then the subsequent massive expansion schemes, which increased the number of personnel from 1.5 million in 1938 to five million in 1941 flooded the VVS with inexperienced personnel and the infrastructure struggled to cope. It still left the VVS short of 60,000 qualified officers in 1941. Despite the expansion of flight schools from 12 to 83 from 1937 to June 1941, the schools lacked half their flight instructors and half of their allotted fuel supplies. Combined with these events, training was shortened a total of seven times in 1939‚Äì1940. The attrition and loss of experienced pilots in Barbarossa encouraged a culture of rapid promotion to positions beyond some pilots' level of competence. It created severe operational difficulties for the VVS.Sterret in Cox and Gray 2002, p. 184.Sterret 2007, p. 76. The process of modernisation in the VVS' frontline strength had started to gain pace and strength. The alleged technical primitivity of Soviet aircraft is a myth. The Polikarpov I-16 fighter and Tupolev SB bomber were just as capable as foreign aircraft. In 1941, the Ilyushin Il-2, Yakovlev Yak-1, Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Gudkov LaGG-3, Petlyakov Pe-2 and Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3 were comparable to the best in the World. Only 37 Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-1 and 201 MiG-3s were operational on 22 June, and only four pilots had been trained to fly them.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 12. The attempt to familiarise pilots with these types resulted in the loss of 141 pilots killed and 138 aircraft written off in accidents in the first quarter of 1941 alone. On 31 August, the first foreign aircraft arrived. The Curtiss P-40 Warhawk was among those handed over but the Soviets did not have Russian-language manuals. The type was evaluated and made it into operations in September/October 1941.Romanenko 2009, pp. 99, 101. Even the most pessimistic German intelligence reports believed, regardless of the numerical superiority of the VVS, the Luftwaffe would be dominant over the battlefield owing to technical and tactical advantages. Air attacks on German ground forces were not considered to be possible, while the Luftwaffe would prove decisive in the role.Plocher 1968, p. 20. Order of battle Luftwaffe assignments =Luftflotte 4= Fliegerkorps V was to support the First Panzer Army and the German Seventeenth Army and German Sixth Army in their quest to capture Kiev and Rostov on an initial front of 215 miles. Rostov was 950 miles from its base at Krak√≥w. Fliegerkorps IV operated on a 350-mile front supporting the German Eleventh Army, Third Romanian Army and Fourth Romanian Army pushing into the Ukraine to conquer the Crimea, on the Black Sea.Plocher 1968, p. 30. The units committed to the Air Fleet were both medium bomber and fighters. Fliegerkorps V under Greim had Kampfgeschwader 51 (KG 51), Kampfgeschwader 55 (KG 55) and I., and II., Kampfgeschwader 54 (KG 54). It was given the complete fighter wing Jagdgeschwader 3 (JG 3). Kurt Pflugbeil and Fliegerkorps IV contained, II./ Kampfgeschwader 4 (KG 4), Kampfgeschwader 27, KG 27, II., III., Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG 77) and I.(J)/Lehrgeschwader 2 (Learning Wing 2). The Deutsche Luftwaffenmission Rumanien (German Air Force Mission Romania) under Hans Speidel had Stab., and III./Jagdgeschwader 52 (JG 52). Luftgaukommando (Air District Command) VIII under Bernhard Waber acted as a reserve. Luftgaukommando XVII under General der Flakartillerie Friedrich Hirschauer was also attached as a reserve. Luftflotte 4 was to coordinate with the Romanian Air Force, though the later was considered independent to the Luftwaffe.Statiev 2002, pp. 1093-1094. =Luftflotte 2= Supporting Army Group Centre's advance on Moscow was, initially, considered the most important objective. Fliegerkorps II and VIII were given the best ground attack units, particularly the former, commanded by von Richthofen. Loerzer's Corps was to support the German Fourth Army and Second Panzer Army on the left of the Army Group's flank. Richthofen supported the Third Panzer Army on the right. The Luftwaffe's front was only 186 miles long, but stretched 680 miles deep. The 1st AA Corps was to help break down border fortresses.Plocher 1968, p. 31. Under Kesselring, the Luftwaffe contained IV./K.Gr.z.b.V. 1, a transport unit with Junkers Ju 52s and Dornier Do 217 for its command headquarters. Fliegerkorps VIII under Richthofen possessed I, and III.,/ Jagdgeschwader 53 (JG 53, Fighter Wing 53), and 2.(F)./122, which was equipped with Ju 88s, Do 17s, Bf 110s and He 111s. II., III., Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27, Fighter Wing 27), II./Jagdgeschwader 52 (JG 52), I., and II., Zerst√∂rergeschwader 26 (ZG 26, Destroyer Wing 26), II.(S). and 10.(S)./Lehrgeschwader 2 (Learning Wing 2). I, Kampfgeschwader 2 and III Kampfgeschwader 3 with Do 17s were also used for ground support, as was I., III./Sturzkampfgeschwader 1 (StG 1, Dive Bombing Wing 1) and I., III./Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 (StG 2) with Ju 87s. Helmuth F√∂rster and Fliegerkorps I, was equipped with Staffeln from Jagdgeschwader 53 (JG 53, Fighter Wing), Kampfgeschwader 1 (KG 1, Bomber Wing 1), Kampfgeschwader 1 (KG 76, Bomber Wing 76) and Kampfgeschwader 77 (KG 77, Bomber Wing 77). Loerzer's Fliegerkorps II contained, I., 11., III., IV., Jagdgeschwader 51 (JG 51), I., and II., SKG 210, I., II., KG 3, I., II., III., Kampfgeschwader 53 (KG 53), and I., II., III./Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 (StG 77). =Luftflotte 1= Supporting Army Group North's advance on Leningrad was supported by Fliegerkorps I. Advancing from East Prussia it was to support the German Sixteenth Army, German Eighteenth Army and Fourth Panzer Army on the left of the Army Group's flank. Richthofen supported the Third Panzer Army on the right. The Luftwaffe's front was only 125 miles long, but stretched 528 miles deep. It was also assigned to dealing with the Soviet Baltic Sea Fleet. Under Alfred Keller, the Luftwaffe contained K.Gr.z.b.V. 106, a transport unit with Junkers Ju 52s and Dornier Do 217 for its command headquarters. Helmuth F√∂rster and Fliegerkorps I, was equipped with Staffeln from Jagdgeschwader 53 (JG 53, Fighter Wing), all of Jagdgeschwader 54 (JG 54), Kampfgeschwader 1 (KG 1, Bomber Wing 1), Kampfgeschwader 1 (KG 76, Bomber Wing 76) and Kampfgeschwader 77 (KG 77, Bomber Wing 77). Fliegerfuhrer Ostsee (Flying Leader East Sea) under the command of Wolfgang von Wild, operated Ju 88s and Heinkel He 115 and Heinkel He 59 floatplanes. Luftgaukommando I, under Richard Putzier was the Luftflotten reserve. =Luftflotte 5= Commanded by Hans- J√ºrgen Stumpff, its main goal was the disruption of Soviet road and rail traffic to and from Leningrad ‚Äì Murmansk, and the interdiction of shipping in the later port, which was bringing in American equipment across the Atlantic Ocean.Plocher 1968, p. 32. The Air Fleet was equipped with 240 aircraft. 1 Staffel JG 77, Stab/Zerst√∂rergeschwader 76 (ZG 76, Destroyer Wing 76), II.(S). and IV.(Stuka)./Lehrgeschwader 1 (LG 1, Learning Wing 1). 5./Kampfgeschwader 30 (KG 30) [single staffel] and I./Kampfgeschwader 26 (KG 26). Battle =Axis air strikes= A destroyed MiG 3, during Barbarossa, 1941. The Luftwaffe's Chief of the General Staff, Hans Jeschonnek, wanted to begin the air attacks before the German artillery started firing. However, Hitler and the OKW decided it may give the opportunity for the Soviets to disperse their air units, and his idea was rejected. Hitler gave the order for the air strikes on airfields to be carried out at dawn. Although many new German bomber crews had only limited training in instrument-flying, the Luftflotten overcame the problem by hand picking experienced crews, who would cross the border at high altitude, to swoop on their targets. The Germans deliberately targeted Soviet fighter air bases first, to knock out potential opposition to its bombers and dive bombers.Leach 1973, pp. 99, 129-130. The first attacks began at 03:00 on 22 June. The Soviets had been caught by surprise, their aircraft bunched together in neat rows which were vulnerable. The results were devastating. At Pinsk aerodrome 39th Mixed Bomber Aviation Regiment of 10th Mixed Aviation Division lost 43 SBs and five Pe-2s on the ground after attacks by KG 3, which lost one bomber. Further to the west, 33rd Fighter Aviation Regiment of the 10th Mixed Aviation Division lost 46 I-53 and I-16s to fighter-bombers of JG 51. Messerschmitt Bf 110s of SKG 210 destroyed 50 aircraft at Kobryn airfield, near the headquarters of 10th Mixed Aviation Division and the Soviet Fourth Army. The airfield based the 74th Attack Aviation Regiment, which lost 47 I-15s, 5 I-153s and 8 IL-2 aircraft on 22 June. Slightly later, KG 54 attacked airfields in the area, and its 80 Ju 88s destroyed 100 Soviet aircraft. However, the Luftwaffe and its allies were far from alone in the skies. The VVS flew 6,000 sorties in comparison to the German 2,272 sorties and VVS ZOVO put 1,900 aircraft into the air. They put up bitter resistance in the air scoring a few successes. Such was the intensity and determination of the Soviet pilots they disregarded their losses and fought with a resolve which surprised German airmen. In several cases Soviet pilots rammed German machines, known as tarans.Begstr√∂m 2007, pp. 14-16. The Stavka were stunned by the initial assault and took several hours to realise the disastrous situation and respond.Begstr√∂m 2007, pp. 17-18. They ordered every available VVS bomber into the air. Without coordination and fighter escort, they suffered catastrophic losses, and flew, quite literally, to the \\"last man\\".Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 19. The Germans believed the bravery of Soviet bomber crews to be unequalled in this regard. In the event, the VVS' bombers kept coming, and on several occasions the Bf 109s wiped out entire formations. It was only 10 hours after the first Axis attacks, at 13:40, that commander of the VVS KA, Pavel Zhigarev, was able to order the long-range aviation into action. The 96 Long-Range Aviation Regiment of 3rd Bomber Aviation Corps put 70 DB-3s into the air but lost 22 with many others returning damaged. The German fighter pilots had it very easy under these circumstances; unescorted bombers in a target-rich environment. JG 53 claimed 74 air victories for two losses. III./JG 53 claimed 36 air victories alone and 28 on the ground. JG 51 was credited with 12 fighters and 57 bombers. JG 54 accounted for 45 air victories and 35 on the ground for one Bf 109 damaged. The Bf 110s of SKG 210 accounted for 334 Soviet aircraft against 14 airfields. It lost seven Bf 110s destroyed or damaged. At the end of the day, German reports claimed 1,489 Soviet aircraft destroyed on the ground alone. At first, these figures were believed to be barely credible. Even Hermann G√∂ring refused to believe the figures and had them secretly checked. In fact, German officers checking the airfields, which were soon overrun by the Wehrmacht, counted over 2,000 wrecks. Soviet sources confirm these totals. The VVS Baltic District lost 56 aircraft on 11 airfields. VVS ZOVO lost 738 of its 1,789 aircraft on 26 airfields. The VVS Kiev District had 23 of its airfields bombed it lost 192 aircraft, 97 on the ground. In addition, 109 training aircraft were destroyed. VVS Odessa, in the south lost 23 aircraft on six airbases. The Long-Range Aviation and naval air forces reported the loss of 336 aircraft. Entire units were nearly wiped out. The 9th Mixed Aviation Division lost 347 out of 409 aircraft including the majority of the 57 MiG 3 and 52 I-16s of its 129th Fighter Aviation Regiment. The division's commander, Sergey Chernykh was shot for the failure.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 20. Only the VVS Odessa, under the command of Fyodor Michugin, was prepared for the assault, losing only 23 aircraft to Emanoil Ionescu's Romanian Air Corps. Ionescu lost four per cent of his strength on this date, the worst Romanian losses on a single day in the 1941 campaign.Statiev 2002, p. 1097. In all, two waves of Axis attacks had struck. In the morning, the first wave destroyed 1,800 aircraft for two losses, while the second wave lost 33 Axis machines but destroyed 700 Soviet aircraft.Hooton 1997, p. 95. The Soviet official history of the VVS only admits to \\"around\\" 1,200 losses.Fetzer and Wagner 1974, p. 35. In the air battles, Axis losses were more significant. In some cases Luftwaffe losses, relevant to their strength were \\"shocking\\"; KG 51 lost 15 Ju 88s in one action. lost 10 He 111s over the airfields. In contrast other bombers units suffered lightly. claimed 40 Soviet aircraft on the ground, for no loss. Total Luftwaffe losses amounted to 78 on 22 June; 24 Bf 109s, seven Bf 110s, 11 He 111s, two Ju 87s, one Do 17 and 10 miscellaneous types. The Romanian Air Force lost four Blenheims, two PZL P-37 fighters, two Savoia-Marchetti SM.79, one Potez 633, one IAR 37 and one IAR 39. Losses amounted to 90 other Axis aircraft. The Soviet claims were a considerable exaggeration; \\"more than 200 enemy aircraft\\" were claimed to have been destroyed on the first day.Fetzer and Wagner 1974, p. 36. The balance of power in the air was altered for the next few months. The Luftwaffe had attained air superiority, if not supremacy at this point. The low German opinion of Soviet combat capabilities had been confirmed, and was bolstered by information provided by captured VVS personnel. The Soviet bomber fleet had been crippled; its remaining forces continued costly attacks on the German rear. The VVS recovered once surprise had worn off. The autumn weather also provided breathing space to partially rebuild.Boog 1998, p. 766. =Luftflotte 2, first encirclement battles= For the first eight days, the Axis put Soviet air bases under intense pressure in a bid to exterminate their air forces while providing the close support demanded by the army. Fedor Kuznetsov, commander of the North-Western Front (Baltic Military District) ordered the large 3rd, 12th and 23rd Mechanised Corps to counterattack the advance of Army Group North. Luftflotte 1's KG 76 and 77 inflicted heavy losses on these columns. It is known the 12th Mechanised Corps lost 40 tanks and vehicles to air assaults. A lack of specialised close support aircraft forced the Germans deployed the Ju 88 in the role, and lost 22 of them in action.Brookes 2003, p. 40. The air attacks on the previous day had reduced the effectiveness of the VVS North-Western Front. They sent unescorted bombers which suffered heavily without fighter escort, which was absent owing to losses in the opening air strikes. Elsewhere, the Luftwaffe helped breakdown Soviet resistance. Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen's Fliegerkorps VIII operated unopposed in the air destroyed large amounts of Soviet ground targets. On 24 June, a Soviet counterattack at Grodno was defeated, and VVS forces from 13 BAD lost 64 SBs and 18 DB-3s against JG 51. On 24 June 557 Soviet aircraft were lost. In the first three days, the Germans claimed 3,000 Soviet aircraft destroyed. Soviet figures put this higher; at 3,922. Luftwaffe losses were 70 (40 destroyed) on 24 June.Bergstr√∂m 2007, pp. 22-24. The Soviet attack lost 105 tanks to air attacks.Brookes 2003, p. 40. Soviet sources acknowledged the lack of coordination between ground and air forces was poor, and that Soviet fighters failed to protect the ground forces which \\"suffered serious losses from enemy bomber attacks\\".Fetzer and Wagner 1974, p. 37. The Luftwaffe delivered a series of destructive air raids on Minsk, and rendered good support to the Second Panzer Army Soviet fighter aviation achieved some success, being held back from fighter escort duties to cover the industrial cities. Soviet bombers tried in vain to destroy German airfields to relieve the pressure.Bergstr√∂m 2007, pp. 24-25. In two notable battles, typical of the campaign, the 57th Mixed Aviation Division lost 56 aircraft on the ground and a further 53 bombers were lost against JG 27 and 53. JG 51 claimed 70 on 25 June, while the Luftwaffe claimed 351.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 25. Heinkel He 111s over the Soviet Union, 1941. The Luftwaffe also flew support for the ground forces, with Richthofen's Fliegerkorps VIII flying valuable support missions. The Soviet 4th Army under Pavlov Kobrin had its headquarters destroyed near Brest-Litovsk by Ju 87s from StG 77.Brookes 2003, p. 33. The fortress in Brest-Litovsk was destroyed by an 1800 SC Satan bomb, dropped by KG 3.Hooton 1997, p. 96. The German Army struggled to maintain the pockets when it did succeed in encircling Soviet formations. Often, the Red Army broke out at night, through gaps. In the day, small groups broke out, avoiding roads and obvious routes. The Luftwaffe failed to interdict because reconnaissance aircraft warned the Soviets. Richthofen developed ad hoc tactics; armed reconnaissance.Mitcham 1988, p. 137. His commanding officer, Kesselring, ordered Luftflotte 2 to fly armed reconnaissance missions, using bombers and Henschel Hs 123s from LG 2, to suppress the Soviet ground forces being encircled by the Second and Third Panzer Armies. The Red Army eased German operations by failing to utilise radios and relying on telephone lines, which had been damaged by air attacks, causing communicative chaos. Dmitriy Pavlov, commander of the Western Front, could not locate his units. Nevertheless, Red Army's standing instructions to fire with all weapons on close support aircraft caused a rise in German losses. Luftflotte carries out 458 sorties on 28 June, half that of 26 June. On 29 June just 290 sorties were flown. The proximity of German forward airfields prevented even more aircraft being lost.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 25. Entire Soviet armies had been surrounded in the Battle of Bia≈Çystok‚ÄìMinsk.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 27. Kesselring, Loerzer and Richthofen concentrated on supply centres in the Minsk and Orsha region. Disrupting communications prevented the Soviets from relieving the pocket.Mitcham 1988, p. 138. Pavlov and his staff were summoned to Moscow and shot. Semyon Timoshenko replaced him. On the same day, an all out effort was made by the VVS Western Front to stop further Axis progress. The 3rd Bomber Aviation Corps, 42nd, 47th and 52nd Long-Range Aviation Division and the TB-3 equipped 1st and 3rd Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment, long-range aviation, struck at German positions at low-level to prevent them crossing the river Berezina at Bobruysk. The result was carnage. German Flak units and fighters from JG 51 decimated the formations. It was a disastrous air battle for the Soviets, which cost them, according to German claims, 146 aircraft. After this, the VVS Western Front could muster only 374 bombers and 124 fighters on 1 July, from a force of 1,789 ten days earlier. On a more positive note, the VVS' 4th Attack Aviation Regiment saw action in June. It was equipped with the Ilyushin Il-2 Shturmovik, and although only trained to land and take off in them, their crews were thrown into the fight. German fighter pilots were shocked by the effectiveness of their heavy, armour, which deflected their fire. Still, the regiment lost 20 crews killed in these battles from a force of 249.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 26. The Bia≈Çystok pocket fell on 1 July and the two Panzer Armies pushed on towards another pocket, west of Minsk. Luftflotte 2 supported the armoured columns in relays and helped encircle four more Soviet armies near the city. Fliegerkorps VIII provided considerable support, as it was equipped for the task. Bruno Loerzer's Fliegerkorps II was not achieving as much success, supporting Heinz Guderian's Second Panzer Army south of Minsk. Logistics were stretched and Loerzer could not direct their bomber and long- range reconnaissance units which were further to the rear. The Panzers had outrun its air support. However, to ensure seamless cooperation from close support aircraft based within 100 km from the front, Major General Martin Fiebig, chief of staff for Fliegerkorps VIII, was established as Close Support Leader II (Nahkampff√ºhrer II). It was an ad hoc group, which allowed Fiebig to take command of Fliegerkorps II's close support units, SKG 210 and JG 51, supporting the Second Panzer Army. Guderian, though not always in agreement with Fiebig's methods, was grateful for the quality of air support. The German army became spoiled with the level of air support, and wanted air power to support operations everywhere. von Richthofen maintained that the Luftwaffe should be held back, and used in concentration for operational, not tactical effect. In the event, Fiebig had been operating without radios for the most part, and friendly-fire incidents were avoided by the use of signal panels and flags. In operational terms, the Luftwaffe, and in particular Richthofen, had performed vwell. Using the Flivos, forward radio liaison officers, the mechanised divisions could summon air support very quickly, usually after a two-hour wait. The Luftwaffe did particular damage to Soviet railways, which Soviet doctrine relied on, aiding the Axis armies. Although one major supply bridge at Bobruysk was knocked out, 1,000 Soviet workers repaired in 24‚Äì36 hours, showing Soviet resolve. The Soviet Union was too open for attacks on road intersections to have much effect on preventing supplies reaching the line, or enemy units retreating, so bridges were focused on. The Luftwaffe continually attacked Soviet airfields around Smolensk and Polotsk. Gomel also received special attention. Luftwaffe interdiction against Soviet communications was also considerable. General Franz Halder noted: \\"The number of track sections occupied with standing trains is increasing satisfactorily\\".Brookes 2003, p. 41. In the event, 287,000 prisoners were taken in the Minsk operation. Kesselring's Luftflotte 2 had destroyed the VVS Western Front by early July. Over 1,000 air victories were filed by German pilots, while another 1,700 were claimed on the ground. Soviet sources admit to 1,669 losses in the air, between 22 and 30 June. In the same period the Soviets claimed 662 German aircraft (613 in the air and 49 on the ground). German losses were 699 aircraft. Some 480 were due to enemy action (276 destroyed and 208 damaged).Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 28. After only slightly more than a week of fighting, the Luftflotten at the front saw their strength drop to 960 aircraft. In total the VVS suffered 4,614 destroyed (1,438 in the air and 3,176 on the ground) by 30 June. By the end of the fighting in the border areas on 12 July, the Soviet casualties had risen to 6,857 aircraft destroyed against 550 German losses, plus another 336 damaged.Boog 1998, p. 764. The disasters of the VVS were largely down to two reasons; the better tactics used by the Luftwaffe and the lack of communications between Soviet pilots. The Luftwaffe used Rotte (or pairs) which relied on wingman-leader tactics. The two flew 200 metres apart, each covering the others blind spot. In combat the leader engaged while the wingman protected his tail. Two Rotte made up a Schwarm (section) and three Schwarme made up a Staffel in stepped up line astern formation. It allowed the formation to focus in looking for the enemy rather than keeping formation. Soviet aircraft fought with little regard for formation tactics, usually along or in pairs without tactical coordination. The lack of radios in aircraft made coordination worse. When the Soviets did use formation methods, the German Finger-four was much better than the Soviet V formation.Brookes 2003, p. 37. =VVS North-Western Front vs Luftflotte 1= Aleksey Ionov and his VVS North-Western Front had avoided the near destruction of the VVS Western Front, but at the cost of conceding much territory. Alfred Keller's Luftflotte 1 had defeated the attempted Soviet counterattack in Lithuania, then the Fourth Panzer Army and Erich von Manstein's LVI Panzerkorps outflanked the Red Army, reaching Daugavpils on 26 June, and advance of 240 kilometres in four days. It was nearly the case, as much of its forces had been largely destroyed. A number of Soviet aircraft had been abandoned, as was seen on 25 June, when III./JG 54 occupied the airfield near Kaunas found 86 undamaged Soviet aircraft, the remains of 8th Mixed Aviation Division. Luftflotte 1 controlled the skies over the battlefields. The VVS forces had lost 425 aircraft in the air and 465 on the ground in the first eight days. Another 187 had sustained battle damage. Out of 403 SB bombers available on 22 June 205 had been shot down, 148 lost on the ground and 33 damaged by 30 June. Fighter losses included 110 I-153s, 81 I-16s, and 17 MiG-3s. The problem for the Luftflotte, was it lacked close support aircraft. It was forced to use medium bombers in the role.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 29. Unable to summon adequate forces, Ionov turned to the VVS KBF, the air force of the Red Banner Baltic Fleet. The plan revolved around a massive air strike, at the bridges in Daugavpils and the airfield, occupied by JG 54 at Duagava. The Soviets had not learned the tactical lessons from the previous air battles and sent their bombers unescorted. 8 BAB, 1MTAP, 57th Bomber Aviation Regiment, and 73rd Bomber Aviation Regiment were intercepted en route. Further attack by 36 bombers from 57th and 73rd Bomber Aviation Regiments was also intercepted. Another attack was made in the evening of 30 June. The 57th and 73rd Bomber Aviation Regiments also fought in the battles. The day cost the Soviets 22 destroyed and six damaged. Ivonov was placed under arrest. His successor, Timofey Kutsevalov took command of the remnants of the VVS North-Western Front, but it had ceased to be a force to be reckoned with. The VVS KBF now assumed responsibility for most air operations.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 30. As Kutsevalov assumed command of the VVS North-Western Front, Nikolai Fyodorovich Vatutin assumed command of Northwestern Front, Red Army. On the first day of his command, he threw the 21st Mechanised Corps into action at Duagavpils to recapture the bridgehead. Despite the lack of close support aircraft, which was eased with the arrival of 40 Bf 110s from ZG 26, Luftflotte 1 delivered a series of air attacks, which accounted for around 250 Soviet tanks. After the attack, the Fourth Panzer Army launched an attack across the Daugava River. The state of the VVS North-Western Front meant Aleksandr Novikov's Northern Front became responsible for operations in the Baltic. It had escaped damage, owing to its assignment in the far north, near Murmansk. However, when the Panzer Army began a breakout of the bridgehead, heavy rain prevented large- scale air operations. When the weather cleared, the Soviet committed unescorted bombers from 2nd Mixed Aviation Division, but lost 28 to JG 54.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 31.Brookes 2003, p. 43. With air superiority Luftflotte 1's KG 1, KG 76 and KG 77 interdicted Soviet communications, slowing down the Soviet ground forces, who failed to reach the area before the Germans broke out. Fliegerkorps I in particular contributed to the success, and the Panzers met only weak opposition. Some Soviet aerial resurgence was seen on 5 July, but the threat was dealt with and 112 Soviet aircraft were destroyed on the ground. A soviet counterattack still occurred, and wiped out a forward advance party of the 1st Panzer Division. Again, the Luftwaffe interdicted and the three bomber groups flew ground support missions at Ostrov, cutting off all supply lines to the city and destroyed 140 Soviet tanks for two bombers lost. More Soviet air strikes against the spearheads were repulsed with high losses.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 33. On 7 July, Soviet aviation did play an important role in slowing the German advance and forcing the Fourth Panzer Army's advance north east, to Leningrad, to stop. They succeeded in getting among German troop and vehicle concentrations and spreading havoc on the congested bridges at the Velikaya River. But they did so at a dreadful price, and lost 42 bombers to JG 54. Between 1 and 10 July, the VVS flew 1,200 sorties and dropped 500 tons of bombs. Army Group North reported heavy losses in equipment. Specifically the 1st Panzer Division noted these losses were caused by air attack. Franz Landgraf, commanding the 6th Panzer Division, reported particularly high losses. However, while some units had nearly been wiped out (2nd and 41st Mixed Aviation Division had lost 60 bombers), the prevented the Fourth Panzer Army from reaching Leningrad, before the Red Army prepared suitable defences. It unlikely that the Red Army could have prevented them from doing so without the intervention of the VVS.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 34. The Soviets were now over the most critical phase. Novikov now drew the conclusion that Soviet air forces could be effective by instituting changes. All bombers were to be escorted, Soviet fighter pilots were encouraged to be more aggressive and take part in low-level suppression attacks, and more night strikes owing to an absence of German night fighter forces would be less costly. Soviet forces did increase their effectiveness. Despite Loerzer's Corps claiming 487 Soviet aircraft destroyed in the air and 1,211 on the ground between 22 June and 13 July, aerial resistance was clearly mounting. On 13 July Army Group North counted 354 Soviet machines in the skies. All this compelled the Luftwaffe to return to bombing airfields. Of particular concern was the taran tactic. The VVS carried out 60 of these attacks in July. In mid- July the battered Fourth Panzer Army reached the Luga River, 96 kilometres south of Leningrad. The Germans closed on Lake Ilmen also. At this point, Army Group North was subjected to the heaviest air attacks thus far. Novikov had concentrated 235 bombers from the North and North-Western Front. It supported an offensive by Alexsandr Matveyev's Soviet 11th Armyon 14 July. Flying 1,500 sorties they helped push back the Germans 40 kilometres and inflict heavy losses on the 8th Panzer Division. The Luftwaffe struggled to be effective because of logistical problems. The only supply road from Pskov to Gdov was impossible to use owing to scattered attacks by Soviet forces. Instead, the Ju 52 transports had to bring in supplies by air. It remain the case until mid- August.Plocher 1968, p. 145. Unable to support the Army Group any further, fast moving operations ended and the battles became slow and attrition based. Army Group North had scored an operational victory, by advancing and securing the Baltic states, but failed to capture Leningrad or destroy the Red Army's North-Western Front. By the end of July 1941, the VVS had flown 16,567 sorties in support of the ground forces.Wagner and Fetzer 1974, p. 49. =Stalemate at Kiev= Simultaneous operations were begun against Yevgebiy Ptukhin's VVS KOVO (Kiev) South-Western Front. Alexander L√∂hr's Luftflotte 4 supported Gerd von Rundstedt's Army Group South which was to capture Kiev and conquer the Ukraine. The Southwestern Front, Red Army was quick to react, destroying bridges along the River Bug. The Germans prepared pontoon bridges, and the VVS South West tried to halt the Axis crossing points. The Soviets claimed to have cause havoc among the advancing Germans but 2nd and 4th Bomber Aviation Corps suffered significant losses against Kurt Pflugbeil's Fliegerkorps IV. JG 3 were particularly successful, shooting down 18 bombers on 23 June. Although the Luftwaffe acknowledged that the VVS KOVO offered it the strongest resistance in June 1941, it did not save Ptukhin, who was arrested on 24 June and shot in February 1942.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 37. Indeed, the air battles had been costly for Luftflotte 4 and German Army reconnaissance units, which lost 92 aircraft (55 written off) from 22 to 25 June. In return, they flew 1,600 sorties against 77 Soviet airbases, and destroyed 774 Soviet aircraft on the ground and 89 in the air. When the Soviet 8th Mechanised Corps resumed an attack against the First Panzer Army, support for the Corps resulted in 22 German aircraft being shot down. Fliegerkorps IV's losses represented the lion's share of otherwise moderate German losses to date.Bergstr√∂m 2007, pp. 38-39. Fliegerkorps V received critical help from the Royal Hungarian Air Force (Magyar Kir√°lyi Honv√©d L√©gier≈ëthe). It consisted of 530, mostly obsolete combat aircraft, including 86 German Ju 86 and Italian Caproni Ca.135. It supported Pflugbeil's Corps in support of the First Panzer Army which was struggling against the Southwestern Front. Both Axis aviation groups played a decisive role in ground support operations. Attacks of the 15th Mechanised Corps destroyed 201 tanks by 30 June causing the Southwestern Front to withdraw. A Soviet counterattack on 1 July was routed by Fliegerkorps IV. On that day 220 motor vehicles and 40 tanks were knocked out by KG 51, KG 54 and KG 55. But losses were high; KG 55 lost 24 He 111s and another 22 damaged; KG 51's strength dropped by one-third, while KG 54 lost 16 Ju 88s put out of action. Nevertheless, air superiority was won, and Soviet rail and road communications were interdicted. The First Panzer Army achieved a breakthrough at Polonnoye-Shepetovka on 5 July while Pflugbeil's Fliegerkorps V assisted, destroyed 18 supply trains and 500 wagons. However, the battles resulted in heavy attrition with both German and Soviet units being withdrawn.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 39. At heavy cost, constant air attacks brought the First Panzer Army's advance to a halt. The Luftwaffe noted that the Soviets used their aviation to gain time, while the Red Army established a defence at Kiev.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 40. Further south the Romanian Third Army and German Eleventh Army advanced toward Mogilev on the Dniestr river and towards Chernovsty in the north. Axis aviation performed well. On 7 July III./KG 27 claimed 70 lorries destroyed while Axis fighters inflicted heavy losses to the VVS South-Western Front. The VVS managed, on rare occasion to catch the Luftwaffe on the ground. 55th Fighter Aviation Regiment knocked out 11 Ju 87s from StG 77 in this regard on 12 July. However, the battle for Moldavia ended that same day. The Romanians had lost 22,765 men (10,439 killed and 12,326 wounded). Its air force had flown 5,100 sorties and shot down 88 Soviet aircraft for 58 losses. JG 77 claimed 130 destroyed in the same period. The Soviet Air Forces admitted 204 losses, but it may have been higher. Its strength fell from 826 non-serviceable to 358, a decrease of 468. German losses amounted to 31 destroyed and 30 damaged.Bergstr√∂m 2007, pp. 40-41. =Luftflotte 2 over Smolensk= Kesselring (left), with his chief of staff, Wilhelm Speidel (centre), and Hermann G√∂ring (right) The victory at Bia≈Çystok‚ÄìMinsk was the first of two major encirclements for Army Group Centre. The second took place in the Battle for Smolensk. On 9 July the Third Panzer Army captured Vitebsk.Brookes 2003, p. 42. For the Smolensk-Orsha operation Fiebig's Close Support Command II provided direct ground support, Fliegerkorps VIII, focused on the northern part of the front, while Loerzer's Fliegerkorps II focused on the Soviet rear areas.Plocher 1968, p. 97. During the first five days of July 1941, Luftflotte2 logged 2,019 sorties and destroyed 353 Soviet aircraft for 41 losses and 12 damaged. On 5 July 183 Soviet aircraft were destroyed on the ground, by Do 17s from III./KG 2 and III./KG 3. Soviet reinforcements still poured in; the 46th Mixed Aviation Division and its IL-2s from 61st, 215th and 430th Attack Aviation Regiment, which had been kept in reserve, began operations. They attacked XXXXVII Panzerkorps. One IL-2, flown by Nikolai Malyshev of the 430th Attack Aviation Regiment, took 200 hits and remained in the air. The ground-attack aircraft caused enough damage to delay the German attack. Meanwhile, German aviation also proved decisive. West of Orsha, the 17th Panzer Division was surrounded by a counterattack on 8 July, and Ju 87s from StG 1, transferred from Fliegerkorps VIII, helped the division breakout. On 11 July Luftflotte 2 helped Guderian's Second Panzer Army across of the Dniepr, contributing 1,048 sorties. Soon afterwards, the 10th Panzer Division encircled the Soviet 13th Army's 12th Mechanised and 61st Rifle Corps by capturing Gorky. Soviet aviation concentrated on the Germans and wiped out an SS Regiment. The front became confused, with large Red Army forces moving east to escape Guderian, and powerful concentrations moving forward to block it. The Luftwaffe concentrated on both streams. Soviet aviation was continually in the air and opposing German air attacks. On 16 July, a major effort of 615 sorties against the Soviet 21st Army in the Bobruysk area, claiming 14 tanks, 514 trucks, nine artillery and two anti-aircraft guns. By 17 July, the 16th and 20th Soviet armies were surrounded at Smolensk and the Soviet 21st Army near Orsha and Mogilev. However, plentiful air support encouraged the German army units to become reluctant in advancing without air cover. German forces became inclined to retreat if the Luftwaffe was not present in strength. The army complained air liaison was not effective enough. Commander of Fliegerkorps VIII, von Richthofen, argued that it took time to organise sorties.Bergstr√∂m 2007, pp. 46-47.Plocher 1968, pp. 97-98. The Southwestern Front Red Army, and the South- Western Front, VVS, had suffered heavily and the three armies were effectively destroyed. But their delaying strategy tied down German forces for a month. They even succeeded in pushing back the 10th Panzer to Yelnya. The VVS, having suffered terrible losses, was now in a position of numerical and qualitative inferiority. The Germans outnumbered the Soviets five to one in tanks, and two to one in artillery, but also two to one in serviceable aircraft. On 20 July the VVS KOVO had only 389 aircraft (103 fighters 286 bombers). The effectiveness of German fighter units, particularly JG 51, saw the new Pe-2 units nearly wiped out. The 410th Bomber Aviation Regiment lost 33 out of 38 bombers it had brought with it on 5 July. The IL-2 equipped 4th Attack Aviation Regiment had only 10 of the 65 aircraft after just three weeks. The Soviets had cleverly concentrated their air power at Yelnya, and the mixture of a decline in Luftwaffe strength (to 600 in the central sector) compelled the Germans to withdraw from the salient.Bergstr√∂m 2007, pp. 46-48 and Hooton 1997, p. 97. The tired German Fourth Army and German Ninth Army closed the pocket around Smolensk. SKG 210, the Bf 110-equipped close support unit destroyed or knocked out 165 tanks, 2,136 motor vehicles, 194 artillery, 52 trains and 60 locomotives with wagons. In the campaign since 22 June, it had accounted for 915 Soviet aircraft, 823 on the ground. Still, some 100,000 Red Army soldiers escaped by Kesselring's estimate. Most escaped at night, which showed even when the Luftwaffe had air superiority, it lacked the all-weather, round the clock capability to prevent the withdrawals. Walther von Axthelm's I Flak Cops played an important part in operations south of Smolensk. As well as using his 101st and 104th motorised regiments, each with three heavy and one light battalion, supported the Second Panzer Army. It was used to protect the ground forces, and claimed 500 Soviet aircraft between 22 August and 9 September, but was also used against ground targets. It claimed 360 Soviet vehicles in the same period.Brookes 2003, p. 42. and Plocher 1968, pp. 98-99.Hooton 1997, p. 97. =First Axis problems= The most concerning aspect for the Axis at this stage as the lack of aircraft. The VVS Western Front had received 900 new aircraft in July. In contrast, Luftflotte 2 had lost 447 in the opening battles for Smolensk, 6 to 19 July. On the Eastern Front the Luftwaffe had lost 1,284 aircraft, half of its original strength. The Kampfgruppen still contributed to the fighting; claiming 126 trains and 15 supply bridges destroyed at Orel, Korobets and Stodolishsche. Another 73 precious motor vehicles, 22 tanks, 15 rail cars had also been destroyed by German air attacks along with another 40 on 25 July. As the pocket was finally destroyed in early August, the Luftwaffe contributed with another round of claims; 100 tanks, 1,500 trucks, 41 artillery pieces and 24 AAA batteries in Smolensk alone. The intensity of the air war over Smolensk it indicated in the number of operations and sorties flown; 12,653 German and 5,200 Soviet. Hitler's attention shifted to Leningrad, and Richthofen's Fliegerkorps VIII was dispatched on 30 July. Hitler's Directive 34 demanded the capture of the port city. Army Group Centre was ordered onto the defensive.Bergstr√∂m 2007, pp. 48, 50. The increased size of the operational theatre, and the ability of the Soviets to replace losses (partly through American Lend-Lease) affected the Luftwaffe's influence on the ground battle. Soviet production replaced aircraft at an \\"astonishing\\" rate, while damage to rail and communication lines were repaired very quickly, meaning German air attacks in this regard could only have temporary effect. The size of the operational theatre meant that German fighter operations were also difficult. While in quality of aircraft, combat tactics, morale and technical standard, the Luftwaffe was still ahead, the Soviets were showing a considerable ability to gain air superiority over the front as the inadequate number of German aircraft was unable to garner air control everywhere. Only local superiority could be obtained, whenever the Bf 109s appeared in strength. German Army forces continually complained about Soviet superiority in the air. The complete supremacy over the front, won in the initial strikes, was beginning to slip away.Diechmann 1968, pp. 160-161. The lack of aircraft for long-range reconnaissance was also a problem. In order to maintain the pressure, and locate any potential Soviet build-up operations, the Luftwaffe needed strategic reconnaissance assets. The large size of the theatre made this essential. However, the lack of units and aircraft meant only select regions could be kept under observation. It was determined the required two daily reconnaissance operations against any one line was impossible to implement for these reasons. Thus the Wehrmacht's air intelligence sections unable to act as the eyes of the army and alert it to danger. What units were available were concentrated in the areas of main pressure.Diechmann 1968, pp. 161-162. Another difficulty was communications. The Air Signals Corps was put under severe pressure. Radio signals over vast areas were vulnerable to interception so telephone lines were used instead. The line from Richthofen's Fliegerkorps VII to Kesselring's command train at Luftflotte 2 was 780 miles. Telephone communications were vulnerable to Partisans. However, the development of radio and their use with forward air controllers, the Flivos was critical and remained unaffected. In this tactical sphere, reports received could be acted upon in real time by use of radio in a short time, lessening the ability of the enemy to react. It enabled the Luftwaffe to respond quickly to fluid events right at the front.Diechmann 1968, p. 162. =Stalemate before Moscow= The central role played by the Luftwaffe was evident when Richthofen's Fliegerkorps VIII was moved to Luftflotte 1 in early August. This left only Fliegerkorps II under Loerzer in the central from, splitting Kesselring's Air Fleet in two. Loerzer lost StG 77 to Luftflotte 4, but gained III./KG 26, I./KG 28 and KGr 100. The lack of substantial air support forced Army Group Centre to abandon a drive on Moscow, and instead to Roslava, where the Soviet 28th Army was putting pressure on the army group's southern flank, in coordination with the other elements of the Reserve front to the north east, at Yelnya. Guderian's Second Panzer Army defeated the 28th Army, and captured 38,000 prisoners. An important part of the victory achieved by Fliegerkorps II owing to weak Soviet air defences. Most of the 3rd Bomber Aviation Corps in the area, under the overall direction of Georgy Zhukov, was protected Moscow and focusing on Yelyna, south east of Smolensk.Bergstr√∂m 2007, pp. 54-56. At Yelyna, VVS Reserve Front, under Boris Pogrebov attacked German positions relentlessly, but suffered heavy losses to JG 51, the main German fighter wing in the area. But while the battles in the Fliegerkorps II area went in the German favour, the north, where Fliegerkorps VIII had operated, there was little to stop the VVS gaining air superiority. The German Ninth Army acknowledged that the \\"enemy enjoys air superiority in the whole army sector.\\" The Soviets also began using fast ground attack aircraft. It made interception difficult and German fighter units often arrived late. Pursuing the Soviets was unprofitable over enemy lines because of strong Soviet AAA fire. The attacks caused light losses, but it lowered the morale of the soldiers. The VVS brought in large numbers of aircraft from all over the country, though most were obsolete and training machines. This brought the strength of VVS to 3,700 by August. But ill-trained and inexperienced crews resulted in continuing heavy losses. Yet by 30 August, the VVS had sustained air superiority, though it failed to help Zhukov make any head way at Yelnya, and Guderian achieving a series of tactical success at Roslavl and Krichev. The effect of Soviet aviation was evident in the severe losses among German transports. By 31 August, the Luftwaffe had lost 1,320 (820 destroyed) since 22 June including 170 Army reconnaissance aircraft and 97 transports and liaison machines. The overwhelming majority were lost to air attack. The VVS reported the loss of 903 aircraft from 10 July to 10 September. The Soviets believed the Blitzkrieg had been stopped short of Moscow. Many started to hope for an imminent turning point in the war. However, the focus of the Wehrmacht had shifted to the north and south; to Kiev and Leningrad.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 56. =Luftflotte 1, the Baltic, advance on Leningrad= Alexander L√∂hr, c-in-c Luftflotte 4 (left) and Richthofen of Fliegerkorps VIII. Richthofen's Corps was a specialised ground attack organisation. In accordance with Hitler's new directive and Luftwaffe flexibility, Fliegerkorps VIII was moved to Luftflotte 1 from Luftflotte 2 to give the former much needed ground support units. II./ and 10(s)./LG 2, III./JG 27, II./JG 52, Do 17s from Stab., I./KG 2, III./KG 3 and Ju 8s from I., III./StG 2 and II./StG 1 and III./StG 1 now came under the air fleet's order of battle. On 8 August, the Fourth Panzer Army opened its assault on the Luga Front, south west of Leningrad.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 57. Commander of the Red Army Northwestern Front, Markian Popov demanded all out attacks on the Axis by the VVS. Although the VVS North- Western Front had 560 aircraft, they were dispersed because of another attack by the Finnish Army in the Karelian Isthmus, north of Leningrad. To support the defence in the north, 162 Soviet aircraft were dispatched. The VVS KBF Naval Aviation was tied up in supporting the Soviet 8th Army in the Battle of Estonia and attacking Berlin. The weather cleared on 10 August enabled Alexsandr Novikov to send 2 BAD and 7th Fighter Aviation Regiment of 5th Mixed Aviation Division from the Lake Imlen and Karelian Isthmus regions. IL-2s from 288th Attack Aviation Regiment claimed large success against Axis ground forces as the VVS North-Western Front flew 908 sorties. Luftflotte 1 flew 1,126 operations on 10 August, claiming ten tanks, 200 motor vehicles and 15 artillery pieces. , on Luftflotte 1's order of battle since 22 June, was invaluable in attacks on Luga, without which the Fourth Panzer Army could not have advanced. The German Army also reported heavy enemy ground attacks, which compelled ZG 26 and II./JG 54 to turn its attention to Soviet airfields claiming 17 to 22 destroyed. On 13 August the Fourth Panzer reached the rail line connecting Tallinn to Leningrad. Novikov dispatched 126 navy aircraft to assist the 8th Army, but air cover was limited. The German Eleventh Army reached Lake Novgorod, north of Lake Ilmen, which would cut communications from Moscow to Leningrad. The battle lasted for 11 days. StG 2 played a vital part, knocking out supply bridges and destroying the fortress in the city. Novgorod was abandoned on 24 August. Luftflotte 2 noted the strength of Soviet air defences were greater than in the central sector.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 58. The Northwestern Front, Red Army, attempted to relieve the pressure in the Novgorod sector. It launched a counterattack near Staraya Russa. All of Fliegerkorps VIII was thrown into countering the attack supplemented by KG 76 and KG 77 from Fliegerkorps I. The attacks destroyed the Soviet concentrations. I./KG 4 conducted rolling attacks all over the front which had a devastating effect on Soviet troop's positions. Do 17s from KG 2 destroyed 18 tanks in one mission on 17 August. The Luftwaffe also maintained pressure on local airfields to maintain air superiority. ZG 26 destroyed 20 Soviet aircraft and damaged 13 more on 19 August, though the Germans claimed 40 for one loss.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 59. The next day another 18 were destroyed in counter air operations by ZG 26.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 60. Fliegerkorps I also contributed decisively to the battle, attacking and destroying Soviet rail traffic.Plocher 1968, p. 148. On 20 August the German Eighteenth Army captured Narva, cutting off and encircling Tallinn and the Sixteenth Army captured Chudovo, cutting one of the two main communication lines from Moscow to Leningrad. Fliegerkorps VIII dropped 3,000 tons of bombs in the preceding 10 days in support of these operations. Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb shifted the XXXXI Panzerkorps south west, instead of north east towards Leningrad. He intended to surround the Soviets in the Luga-Novgorod area. But the Soviets were well prepared, not least in the air. The VVS North West received 402nd and 6th Fighter Aviation Regiments which revived Soviet air power there. Equipped with 32 new LaGG-3 fighters, it boasted strength of 174 aircraft on 24 August. The German noticed that the Soviets had improved in quality. The bulk of the 299 aircraft available in the north were given to the VVS Leningrad Front. Only the 1st and 55th Mixed Aviation Division were assigned to the VVS Karelian Front. Ju 88A of Lehrgeschwader 1 over the Eastern Front, 25 September 1941. Richthofen moved his units to Spasskaya, 48 kilometers north east of Novgorod to support operations. The XXXXI Panzerkorps succeeded in encircling the Soviets, but in their defence the PVO 7 Fighter Aviation Corps engaged Fliegerkorps VIII in a series of intense air battles on 25 August. Over the next four days more battles took place. JG 54 claimed 188 victories in August; the 7 Fighter Aviation Corps admitting 44 losses between 20 and 30 August, for 25 claims made. The 26th and 191st Fighter Aviation Regiment lost 17 fighters between them, while the 35th and 44th Fighter Aviation Regiments suffered the loss of five between them, from a force of 154 fighters (113 serviceable). The hardest hit German units were StG 1 and KG 77, which lost 20 and 14 respectively. Over the next few days, Operation Beowulf captured the small Estonian islands and the Luftwaffe turned its attention to Leningrad.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 61. Messerschmitt Me 321 transports brought in supplies for the infantry formations ashore, while bombing attacks were carried out against coastal batteries during further operations, such as Nordwind. On 21 October all the Baltic islands were declared under Axis control. The Luftwaffe's losses eight Ju 88s, two Bf 110s, two Bf 109s and an air-sea-rescue aircraft. It flew 1,313 sorties against Saaremaa island, claiming 26 batteries, 25 artillery pieces, 26 motor vehicles, 16 field emplacements, seven bunkers, seven barracks, one ammunition dump and two columns of horse-drawn transport. In addition four motor torpedo boats, three minesweepers, 13 merchant ships and four smaller ships were sunk. In the air 15 enemy aircraft were destroyed.Plocher 1968, pp. 170-171. The Luftwaffe also did much damage to the Soviet Red Banner Baltic Fleet during the Baltic advance. Ju 88 units operating over Estonia inflicted severe losses on Soviet shipping. KGr 806 sank the Soviet destroyer Karl Marx on 8 August 1941 in Loksa Bay Tallinn. During the Soviet evacuation of Tallinn, more damage was done. On 28 August the Ju 88s had more success when KG 77 and KGr 806 sank the 2,026 grt steamer Vironia, the 2,317 grt Lucerne, the 1,423 grt Atis Kronvalds and the ice breaker Kri≈°jƒÅnis ValdemƒÅrs (2,250 grt). The rest of the Soviet \\"fleet\\", were forced to change course. This took them through a heavily mined area. As a result, 21 Soviet warships, including five destroyers, struck mines and sank. On 29 August, the Ju 88s accounted for the transport ships Vtoraya Pyatiletka (3,974 grt), Kalpaks (2,190 grt) and Leningradsovet (1,270 grt) sunk. Furthermore, the ships Ivan Papanin, Saule, Kazakhstan and the Serp i Molot were damaged. Some 5,000 Soviet soldiers were lost. Luftwaffe Commander Baltic had been set up in April 1941, and brought together units under an ad hoc command system to disrupt Soviet sea traffic around Leningrad. The White Sea ‚Äì Baltic Canal was rendered unusable for some time after a major lock was knocked out at Povenets on 15 July. From 22 June to 31 August, 1,775 sorties was flown against the canal; 737 by the 806th Coastal Air Group, 339 by JG 54 and eight by II./KG 1, and a number by small naval air squadrons. They sank 66,000 tons of shipping including five destroyers and another 17,000 tons of merchant shipping damaged, probably beyond saving. One heavy cruiser, 17 destroyers and 132,000 tons of merchant shipping was damaged for the loss of 11 Ju 88s and five Bf 109s. Three Arado Ar 95 and one Arado Ar 196 was lost. The VVS lost 46 aircraft in defensive operations. On 26 October, Leningrad had been completely surrounded, and there was little need to attack the canal passing through, since it was blocked by siege. Luftwaffe Command Baltic was disbanded on 26 October and some of its units sent to Fliegerkorps I.Plocher 1968, pp. 175-176. =Luftflotte 4 at Uman= The Southwestern Front under the command of Mikhail Kirponos had offered severe resistance to Army Group South, under von Rundstedt. In mid-July it halted the Axis advance west of Kiev. Frustrated, Rundstedt instructed the bulk of his army group to head south, towards Uman. The intention was to envelop the Soviets via a flank attack on their open left flank. Luftflotte 4 under Alexander L√∂hr was ordered to support the operation.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 62. The Luftwaffe's attacks on Soviet railway lines had a tremendous impact on the Red Army's ability to conduct operations west of the Dnieper. It enabled the First Panzer Army to capture Bila Tserkva, south west of Kiev. The German Eleventh Army prepared to cross the Dniestr river in a northerly direction. It was soon realised the Germans were attempted an encirclement operation, and the VVS was called in. The VVS Southern Front was still engaged in Moldavia, so the battered VVS South Western Front had to be deployed. Kirponos told Astakhov, commanding the VVS formation, \\"Take all you've got and throw it against the tanks...! Keep on attacking! This is your main task!\\" The few bombers left took to the air. Fortunately bad weather prevented German fighters intercepting effectively and considerable damage was done to German columns, but the offensive could not be stopped. StG 77 supported the Eleventh Army to Yampol, while German bombers pounded rail transports despite low cloud and rain. claimed 20 trains destroyed on 20 July. Luftflotte 4 flew continuous interdiction attacks, and there was little to stop them. With the VVS needing to concentrate its diminished assets at the critical points, Soviet units were ordered back to Kiev to rebuild and help prevent the Germans crossing the Dniepr. The Soviets effectively abandoned the skies over Uman. By 25 July it became clear the effect of air interdiction was having, when a Soviet communication to Moscow stated; \\"All efforts to withdraw the 6th and 12th Armies to the east and north east are fruitless.\\"Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 63. But attrition was starting to show in the German ranks. Several German formations had to be sent home owing to their depleted state. Stab./JG 53, I./JG 53, I./KG 54, III./KG 51 and III./55 had all been withdrawn to Germany. I./KG 54 had been particularly successful, claiming thousands of vehicles, 240 aircraft and hundreds of tanks and artillery destroyed at a cost of 23 aircraft. On 7 August the Soviets attempted to relieve the pocket by launching a surprise counter offensive at Boguslav, halfway between Kiev and Uman. For a while it seemed as the entire German flank was going to give way and prompt a suspension of operations at Uman. The Luftwaffe tipped the balance back in the Axis favour. Kurt Pflugbeil's Fliegerkorps V conducted rolling attacks on the attacking Soviet 26th Army. In two days 148 motor vehicles and 48 Soviet tanks were destroyed which stopped the attack. Rolling attacks were used in turn against the trapped Soviet armies. On 10 August Luftflotte 2 destroyed another 300 vehicles and 54 tanks. Fliegerkorps V claimed 420 motor vehicles, 58 tanks and 22 artillery batteries. The battle ended with 79,220 soldiers of the two armies dead, and 103,054 captured, although a large number were civilians that had been rounded up.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 64. =Two Luftflotten against Kiev= Soviet South-Western Front's commander, Semyon Budyonny, decided to abandon most of the western Ukraine, in light of the Uman disaster. Only the port of Odessa was to be held. His 26th Army, which had been successfully been holding the Germans 96 kilometres south of Kiev. The army was ordered to withdraw across the Dniepr. Von Rundstedt now focused on an encirclement of Kiev from the south, aimed at destroying the 26th Army.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 66. Von Rundstedt turned to the Luftwaffe to repeat the victory at Uman, be destroying logistics and communication lines in order to prevent the 26th Army's retreat. L√∂hr ordered his units into action. The main retreat route was across the Dniepr, river, so bridges were a prime target. StG 77 and its Ju 87s were called upon to make unbroken attacks on the bridges, particularly at Kanev. The VVS concentrated all available fighter forces in defence of the bridges. The air battles opened on 13 August when the 88th Fighter Aviation Regiment fought over the bridgehead, against JG 3, which were concentrated there to ensure the Ju 87s were able to carry out their assignments unhindered. Through a skilfully handled withdrawal, the 26th Army was able to escape. Luftflotte 4 failed in its operations to isolate the Soviets, and the defenders themselves blew the bridge once their move was complete. L√∂hr, with help from Kesselring's Luftflotte 2, turned to preventing the remnants of the Red Army's Southwestern Front escaping over the lower Dniepr. Luftflotte 2 supported Guderian in the north. On 17 August Robert Ritter von Greim's Fliegerkorps V opened intensive operations against the traffic centres of Dnepropetrovsk, but the air fleet was too weak after eight weeks of operations and was unable to achieve success. Operations were soon shifted to helping the First Panzer Army across the river at Zaporozhye, and Cherkassy. The 11th Panzer Division captured a bridgehead at Gornostaypol before the Soviets could destroy it. The Soviet 5th Army, north of Kiev, followed the 26th Army across the river on 23 August. The same day, after Hitler's order to focus on Leningrad and Kiev, Guderian's Second Panzer Army, Army Group Centre, pushed south at Gomel with the aim of joining with Rundstedt to the east of Kiev. Fliegerkorps II used JG 51 and SKG 210 to support him.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 67. Radio station of the V. Fliegerkorps near Zvenyhorodka on 11 September 1941 KG 3 and KG 53 destroyed the rail stations at Chernogov, 160 kilometres to the south as Guderian broke through the weak Soviet flank, at the junction of the 13th and 40th Soviet Armies, advancing 96 kilometres in the first day and seized bridgeheads at Novhorod-Siverskyi. Kirponos, commanding VVS South-Western Front ordered his forces against the bridgehead at Gornostaypol, but lost 33 of his aircraft in the process. One IL-2 of the 74th Attack Aviation Regiment did knock out the bridgehead with one hit. The loss of the bridge seriously delayed the advance of the German Sixth Army. Meanwhile, 210 Attack Aviation Regiment attacked the bridgehead at Dnepropetrovsk. It claimed several tanks and 13 German vehicles. The Romanian, Hungarian, Italian and Slovakian air units were involved in the combats. The 22 Gruppo Caccia had 51 Macchi C.200s on strength and claimed successes for no losses. To defeat Guderian, the newly formed Bryansk Front under Andrey Yeremenko sought to encircle Guderian's spearhead. It was given the best Soviet equipment, and new T-34 tanks to do the job. He was also assigned the new VVS Bryansk Front under Fydor Polynin. The front had 464 combat aircraft. In August 1941 the new Stavka Reserves, indicated the Soviet ability to replace losses, including six RAG (Reserve Aviation Groups) equipped with the most modern aircraft. It was also supplemented by aircraft from flight schools, from the Transcaucasus Military District, from the Moscow PVO and the naval air forces. The VVS formations suffered high losses against the veteran German formations, JG 51, losing 35 aircraft on 27 August. Fliegerkorps II's bombers delayed reinforcements through interdiction. But when the Soviets did strike on 29 August, it compelled Guderian to go over to the defensive.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 68. Fliegerkorps II attacked the Chernigov bridgeheads to slow down Soviet reinforcements while SKG 210 provided close air support. The VVS was in constant action against German bridgeheads on airfields. At the end of August, Luftflotte 4 was down to 320 bombers, around 100 operational fighters, and 35 reconnaissance machines. The VVS North- Western Front and Southern possessed 493 bombers, 473 fighters and 20 reconnaissance aircraft. Most were concentrated in the first Front. The VVS Southern Front could muster only 119 serviceable machines. Its units had sustained heavy losses in the past four weeks. As Guderian reached the Seym river, halfway between Kiev and Kursk, JG 3 and the Slovak 12 Letka, under the command of Ivan Haluznicky, were concentrated in order to protect them, and were involved in intense air battles with the 249th Fighter Aviation Regiment. The intervention of German bomber units had a huge impact. At Chernigov, KG 28 bombed supply bridges and artillery concentrations. Other units were also involved. In a measure of the effectiveness of German bombers, KG 3 was credited with 349 trains, 488 trucks, 30 tanks and 450 Soviet aircraft on the ground. It also shot 21 fighters down in combat since 22 June. As a result of air attacks, the Bryansk Front called off the offensive. Counterattacks were ordered by Budyonny against the German Seventeenth Army and First Panzer Army. The Soviet 38th Army attacked, but was pinned down by heavy air attacks. It reported; \\"Impossible to move in the open terrain due to aerial attacks\\". Soviet air attacks suffered heavy losses to German fighters. Joseph Stalin intervened personally and over 90 per cent of Soviet aviation to counter Guderian in the north and support the Soviet 40th Army, down to 5,000 soldiers and 10 tanks.Bergstr√∂m 2007, pp. 68-69.Plocher 1968, p. 147. Guderian's army seized more important bridgeheads at Lubny and Lokhvitsa, the latter by the 3rd Panzer Division. The 38th Army's attempt to prevent this was a disaster. The Luftwaffe's rolling attacks destroyed the remnants of the army. The VVS Bransk Front and VVS South-Western Front had lost an opportunity to intervene. German fighters established an air umbrella over the First Panzer Army under Ewald von Kleist as he moved rapidly north to meet Guderian.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 69. On 14 September, the two Panzer Armies were ordered to close the pocket. Guderian established contact with Kleist at Lubny the same day, trapping 450,000 Soviet personnel. The Luftwaffe was now asked to help retain the Red Army within the pocket so they could be destroyed. Fliegerkorps V destroyed 727 trucks operating from Kirovograd. I./KG 55 was credited with 675 trucks, 22 tanks and 58 trains in the Battle of Kiev. One crew destroyed seven trains in a single sortie. Fuel was short owing to logistical shortcomings, and the less fuel thirst Ju 87s were to finish off the trapped forces. On 16 and 17 September, StG 77's Ju 87s destroyed 920 vehicles in the pocket and eliminated the fortress there. Soviet manpower losses were severe. Morale in the pocket was close to collapse. From 12 ‚Äì 21 September 1941, Fliegerkorps V claimed 42 aircraft destroyed on the ground and 65 in the air, plus 23 tanks and 2,171 motor vehicles. To this total were added 52 trains, 6 anti-aircraft batteries, 52 trains, 28 locomotives destroyed and another 355 damaged motor vehicles, 41 horse-drawn wagons and 36 trains damaged. A bridge and 18 rail lines were severed. The cost was 17 aircraft lost and 14 damaged, nine men killed, five wounded and 18 missing.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 70.Boog 1998, p. 784. Fliegerkorps V had flown 1,422 sorties and dropped 567,650 kg of bombs. The Luftwaffe helped maintain the effectiveness of the encirclement, preventing many, but not all, Soviet formations from escaping.Cooper 1981, p. 229. In particular, the destruction of rail lines prevented Soviet forces from reinforcing the line, or withdrawing.Cooper 1981, p. 227. =Luftflotte 5 over Karelia= The original plan for operation \\"Silver Fox\\". Hans-J√ºrgen Stumpff's Luftflotte 5 was responsible for Axis air operations over the far north, along with the Finnish Air Force. The port of Murmansk and the Kirov railway were the major objectives; the later was Murmansk's life line to the Soviet interior. The port was the only ice-free port in northern Russia. Only the 7th Army and 14th Army were deployed. The 7th almost covered the entire Soviet-Finnish border between Lake Ladoga and the Kola Peninsula. The 14th Army protected the northern Kola, the Kirov railway and Murmansk port. The German forces suffered from huge logistics issues. It was only when the Swedish government allowed them to transport their forces through Sweden that these problems were eased. The aim of the Axis was to capture Murmansk, the severe the Kirov railway and isolate the Kola Peninsula. The air war started in the north before 22 June. 72 SAP VVS was involved in running air skirmishes with reconnaissance aircraft. On 22 June only small raids were carried out owing to weather conditions. One of the air fleet's units, Fliegerf√ºhrer Kirkenes (Flying Leader Kirkenes), was responsible for air superiority and anti-shipping operations over Murmansk. Almost immediately, German bomber crews of KG 30 came to respect the heavy AAA defences over Murmansk. The Soviet fighter units were also more experienced the most others. Half had seen action during the Spanish Civil War, Battles of Khalkhin Gol or during the Winter War with Finland. The 145th Fighter Aviation Regiment, 137th Bomber Aviation Regiment and 202 SAP carried out most Soviet operations. caused serious damage to Murmansk's port facilities on 29 June and knocked out its power plant. Ju 87s of IV.(St)/LG 1 helped support the ground advance of Eduard Dietl's XIX Mountain Corps. Without the Ju 87s and their continuous attacks on Soviet positions, an advance to Murmansk could not have been made. The VVS struck at German logistics in Liinahamari and Petsamo. The 137th Bomber Aviation Regiment sank one freighter and inflicted heavy damage to the Wharf area and oil tanks in the ports. After advancing only 24 kilometres Dietl's force was halted. Worse was to follow, when the Soviet Northern Fleet landed Soviet marines behind Dietl's force at the Rybachiy Peninsula. LG 1's Ju 87s could not be concentrated on the force, as they were shifted 320 kilometres to the south to help the Finnish-German XXXVI Corps push to Salla in a bid to isolate the Kola, a plan named Operation Silver Fox. The simultaneous battles stretched German resources. In the north Dietl's force was attacked on 2 July by the 72 SAP which flew 45 operations and dropped 400 bombs in three hours. failed to interdict Soviet naval forces and airfields which supported the landing at Rybachy, not least because of VVS fighter defences. The Germans' response was to bring in elements of JG 77, a Bf 109-equipped unit. Supported by Freya radar with a range of 128 to 160 kilometres, increasing numbers of Bf 109s and Bf 110s put the VVS under pressure. In what may be described as psychological warfare, the German pilots practised \\"helter-skelter\\" tactics, whereby German fighters attacked bombers and fighters singly but relentlessly to create the impression there were more Axis fighters in combat than there were. They inflicted fearsome losses on the VVS. 147th Fighter Aviation Regiment lost 33 out of 53 I-153s by 9 July. The 145th Fighter Aviation Regiment recorded a loss of 14 losses from 22 June to 10 July. On 14 and 16 July the Soviet Fleets landed more forces behind Dietl. LG 1's Ju 87s were shifted back to support the Mountain Corps. On 20 July the Soviet destroyer Stremitelnyy was sunk along with the patrol ship SKR-20/Shtil in the Kola Bay by LG 1. Just days later it was moved back to support the offensive at Salla. The unit was treated like a fire-brigade, rushing from one hot spot to another. IV(St)./LG 1's Ju 87s suffered more than any other Stuka unit in 1941, losing 25 of its 36 aircraft. Badly depleted, it could not support a breakthrough to isolate the Kola Peninsula, nor could it support the capture of Murmansk by Dietl. The advance halted 64 kilometres short of the Kirov railway, and three years of positional warfare set in. The greatest success of the Axis in the north came not against the Soviets, but the British Royal Air Force (RAF). On 25 July 200 P-40s were given to the Soviet Union by Winston Churchill. As a naval strategist, the Far North appealed to Churchill for intervention. He sent the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) to conduct an attack on Finnish bases at Kirkenes and Petsamo. On 30 July the aircraft carrier Victorious and Furious were dispatched to deliver the strike forces. Fairey Albacores of 817 Squadron, Fairey Swordfish from 812 Squadron, escorted by six Fairey Fulmars of 801 Squadron took off. The operation from Victorious was a disaster. 20 Albacores from 827 and 828 Squadrons, and nine Fulmars from 809 Squadrons were intercepted. The FAA losses indicated 13 lost and nine Albacores damaged. Twelve five airmen were killed and 22 captured. Hurricanes played an important air defence role in 1941. Britain's decision to aid the Soviets meant sending supplies by sea to the far northern ports, and as the convoys would need to sail within range of German bases from the based in neighbouring Finland, it was decided to deliver a number of Hurricane Mk IIBs, flying with Nos. 81 and 134 Squadrons of No. 151 Wing RAF, to provide protection. The carrier Argus delivered 48 P-40s and 39 Hurricanes in August. =Siege of Leningrad= In early September 1941, the Soviet forces surrounded Novgorod and the Luga river and 20,000 Soviet soldiers were captured. With this force removed, the Army Group North could begin operations against Leningrad. Operating with a flexible command structure, the forces of Luftflotte 1 were reinforced with other formations. Wolfram von Richthofen's Fliegerkorps VIII joined Fliegerkorps I from Luftflotte 2 to give Luftflotte 1 much needed ground support units. On 6 September, the air attacks began with an intensity not yet seen in aerial warfare. The two German air corps carried out 1,004 sorties on the first day. From this total, 186 were brought to bare on a front measuring less than 16 square miles. The 186 operations were flown in a series of attacks lasting 11 hours.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 82.Plocher 1968, p. 146. The Luftwaffe was free from the interference from Soviet fighters. By concentrating two Fliegerkorps on the entire sector, the Germans achieved numerical superiority. Luftflotte 1 mustered 481 aircraft (203 bombers, 166 fighters, 39 Bf 110s, 12 long-range reconnaissance aircraft and 60 Ju 87s). The VVS Leningrad Front could only muster 286 aircraft (163 operational). Most were fighters. On 14 September, just 21 bombers and strike aircraft were on the order of battle (11 SBs, two IL-2s, six Pe-2s and two Ar-2s). This left the VVS Leningrad Front short of hitting power. On 8 September Army Group North attacked with the Eighteenth Army on the left and the XXXIX Corps on the right, forming a two-pronged attack. Fliegerkorps VIII put the defending Soviet 54th Army under severe pressure, forcing it back from Lake Ladoga and cutting the city off from the Soviet hinterland. The focus of German air operations shifted to the centre of the city. On the night of 8 September, beginning at 18:55, 6,327 incendiaries alone were dropped by 27 Ju 88s causing 183 fires. Leningrad's Badayevo warehouses were hit, destroying the entire sugar reserve of 2,500 tons. Crews from KG 4 flew two missions per night while the Fliegerkorps flew hundreds of missions in an effort to destroy Leningrad from the air. Missions were mainly flown at night, owing to heavy Soviet AAA fire and fighter defences, reinforced by 7 Fighter Aviation Corps. On 9 September, Luftflotte 1 carried out 479 sorties. On 10 September, it flew 436. On 11 September, the Axis ground forces advanced into the breaches created by the Luftwaffe. The German bomber units flew 478 sorties on 11 September, and pilots from the VVS KBF's 5th Fighter Aviation Regiment had to fly seven missions per day.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 83. On 12 September Zhukov ordered Aleksandr Novikov, commander-in-chief of the VVS North-Western Front to dispatch all available aircraft against German troop concentrations and airfields. Despite heavy pressure by Soviet fighter bombers, the German 58th Infantry Division captured Krasnoye Selo, inside the city district of Leningrad.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 86. The Stavka pulled together aircraft from various commands to supply the encircled city from the air on 13 September. The Civil Air Fleet contributed PS-84s (Lisunov Li-2s) from both the Special Northern Aviation Group and six Squadrons from The Moscow Air Group (MAGON GVF). The Long-Range Aviation contributed aircraft from 7th Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment and 39 TBAE from KBF's transport fleet. Apart from three of MAGON GVF's squadrons, which flew directly from Moscow to Leningrad, most operated out of Tikhvin. Through late September, 100 tons arrived daily from Soviet civil aviation. In October, it increased to 150 tons daily. Losses were light owing to the Soviet tactic of flying in fog and darkness, avoiding German fighters. When Tikhvin was captured in November, TB-3s from 14th Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment in addition to 7th Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment. On 9 November, Stalin personally ordered that 200 tons daily were to be flown in over the following five days. 127th and 154th Fighter Aviation Regiments were handed over for escort operations. Although some formations were intercepted, most went undetected. The transports made a considerable contribution to the starving city. The MAGON GVF flew in 6,186 tons, including 4,325 tons of food and 1,271 tons of ammunition from 10 October to 25 December. Soviet fighters flew 1,836 sorties escorting them.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 95. A Soviet counter offensive on 14 September drove the Germans back from Sosnovka and Finskoye Koyrovo, with support from the VVS and Red Banner Fleet. The Luftwaffe responded with an aerial onslaught that surpassed the pressure exerted on the first day. German bomber units flew 606 operations against Soviet positions. Three large ships were spotted by German air reconnaissance trying to make it through to Leningrad across Lake Ladoga (it had not yet frozen). Ju 87s from StG 2 were sent to intercept and sank two of them. The VVS also made a maximum effort against German forces. JG 54 was called upon to protect German supply columns and spearheads under attack on the Luga-Leningrad highway south of Krasnogvardeysk. On Friday 19 September, six major German air attacks against Leningrad caused serious damage. Bombs hit a hospital killing 442 people. Fliegerkorps I record the loss of six aircraft. Logistics issues struck soon after, and the declining number of operational German fighters and increased demands from the German bomber crews for escort against increasingly resistant Soviet fighters left the VVS in control of the air over Leningrad. A combination of this and aggressive Soviet air attacks forced Hitler to abandon Leningrad's capture. Instead, he turned east, toward the wedge that had cut the city off from the Soviet hinterland, and to the Red Army forces that were trying to break it.Bergstr√∂m 2007, pp. 86-87. The Soviet 54th Army was renamed the 48th Army in September. It had been depleted to 6,000 men after the Battle of Novgorod. But reinforced, it began to threaten the German XXXIX Corps occupying the wedge that cut Leningrad off from the rest of Russia. Provided with effective air support, they forced the 8th Panzer Division back on 24 September. Fliegerkorps VIII had been returned to Luftflotte 2, and the Fourth Panzer Army was sent to Army Group Centre. In addition, Fliegerkorps I's III./KG 4 and KG 76 had been sent to the central sector for the upcoming attack on Moscow. At this point, the Soviets nearly re-established communications with Leningrad, and driving the German XXXIX Corps back. The army turned to the Luftwaffe to fly in reinforcements quickly. The Spanish Blue Division, the German 72nd Infantry Division from France, and the 7th Fliegerdivision were all flown in by I., II., IV./KGzbV 1, KGrzbV 106, I., and II./LG 1 of the Luftwaffe's transport units. The Germans withdrew several units from Luftflotte 1. JG 53 headed back to Germany leaving JG 54 as the air fleet's only fighter unit and Fliegerkorps VIII was given back to Kesselring for the Moscow offensive. The VVS North-Western Front was reduced to the size of a division, with only 191 aircraft on strength by 22 September. It had sustained 1,283 combat losses including 749 in the air. On the Northern Front (including the arctic), total losses amounted to 2,692 since 22 June. Only 450 replacements had reached the line. Several divisions, including the 2 BAD and 41st Mixed Aviation Division were almost destroyed. It was fortunate that Soviet intelligence correctly determined that the Germans were abandoning the Leningrad offensive, and moving their armour to the central sector. It was decided that Moscow was the more vulnerable city, so the Red Army and VVS concentrated its greatest resources there.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 88. =Luftflotte 2; Defeat at Moscow= =Strategic bombing= In November 1941, the Wehrmacht was already near Moscow. But from the rear of the Soviet Union, military equipment and armaments continued to arrive. The main supplier was GAZ, which was in Gorky (now Nizhny Novgorod). Therefore, the German command developed a plan to destroy the industrial potential and occupation of the city. Thus, Germany was counting on gaining control over the entire Volga region. On 4 November, the Luftwaffe began bombing of Gorky. After the first raid, some workshops of GAZ and the Dvigatel Revolyutsii plant were damaged. The main building was destroyed at the Nitel plant, which caused the death of the director and management. The second attack on the city brought much more destruction. GAZ was almost completely disabled. On its territory, many shops and adjoining social facilities were destroyed. References ;Citations ;Bibliography * Andrews, William.

It portrays the emperor Maximilian I. History In the Spring of 1512, the newly elected emperor Maximilian I of Habsburg sojourned in Nuremberg, where he got acquainted with D√ºrer. To celebrate the emperor and his house, the artist conceived the large Triumphal Arch woodcut, for which he was rewarded with 100 yearly florins. The preparatory drawing. In 1518, during the Diet of Augsburg, Maximilian called D√ºrer to portray him. The artist met the emperor in the castle and made a pencil drawing of him, from which he later painted the panel portrait. On the drawing's margin, he noted: \\"Is the emperor Maximilian that I Albrecht D√ºrer portrayed in Augsburg, up in the high palace, in his small room, Monday 28 June 1518\\". The oil panel was completed when the emperor had already died, with some variants from the initial drawing. The latter is now housed in the Albertina, Vienna. Description The emperor is portrayed from three-quarter on a green background. The arms lie on an unseen parapet coinciding with the lower boundary of the painting, according to the Flemish painting tradition. His left hand holds a large pomegranate, a symbol of cohesion in diversity and thus of the Holy Roman Empire (the grains representing his subjects). Maximilian wears a gown with a very wide fur collar and a broad-brimmed dark hat, with a brooch in the center. His grey hair crown his aged (Maximilian was 59 at the time) but still aristocratic face. In the upper left is the Habsburg coat of arms and Golden Fleece chain, near a long inscription in capital characters which gives the titles and the deeds of the emperor.

Regalado. A story of romance, the novel revolves around love, marriage, adultery, unfaithfulness, treachery, hatred, disowning, and forgiveness. May Pagsinta'y Walang Puso was one of the novels Regalado had written during the Golden Age of the Tagalog Novel (1905-1935). Description May Pasginta'y Walang Puso was first published in 1921. After obtaining permission from Eriberto Regalado, a relative of I√±igo Ed Regalado, the novel was republished by the Ateneo de Manila University Press in 2001. The novel exposed the historical ambience of the Philippines Plot The novel is composed of three parts. The first part tackles the budding relationship between Sela and Fidel. However, Fidel did not marry Sela. The second part narrated Sela‚Äôs suffering caused by Fidel's unfaithfulness. Sela found a new lover in Rufo. The last part shows how Sela was haunted by her past, a past that also became her source of happiness. Apart from Sela, Fidel, and Rufo, the other characters were Rafael and Marya. Language A novel belonging to The Golden Age of the Tagalog Novel (1905-1921), the language used by I√±igo Ed Regalado was described by Roberto T. A√±onuevo as a Tagalog-language that challenges the reader to study the language and the history of the Philippines, particularly in Tagalog literature. Regalado wrote the novel when adultery was a sensitive topic in Philippine literature, thus he used language that was not obvious or vulgar, although may still be considered by Philippine society of the time as \\"controversial and dense in content\\". Regalado tamed his language by using words and descriptions that were metaphorical, parable-like, and allegorical, particularly those that are pertaining to women.

He is best known as the author of the second book on China that was published in Europe, and the first author of such a book to obtain wide circulation outside of Portugal. The foremost scholar of the European literature about Asia, Donald F. Lach, noted in 1965 about Escalante, \\"Very little is known about his biography\\". However, a significant amount of research on Escalante, spearheaded by Rufo de Francisco, was carried out in the late 20th century. Biography Drawing of the Tower of London made by Bernardino de Escalante in his manuscript dated 1586. He is one of the few important personages of the period whose original drawings have been preserved.Bernardino de Escalante was born in Laredo, Cantabria, and came from a lineage of Cantabrian hidalgos. His father, Garc√≠a de Escalante, was a sea captain and shipowner. Based in Laredo, then one of the most important ports of Spain's northern coast, Garc√≠a de Escalante engaged in sea trade and participated in a number of important military campaigns. Some of Bernardino's early training was as part of the crew of his father's boat, on its twice-a- year journeys to Flanders. Bernardino's mother, Francisca de Hoyo, belonged to a well-connected family as well: her sister Catalina de Hoyo was married to Prince Philip's (later, King Philip II's) secretary, Pedro del Hoyo. Following his uncle Pedro, young Bernardino de Escalante entered the retinue of the future King Philip II in 1554. He was aboard his father's boat, La Concepci√≥n, which was part of the fleet taking Prince Philip to England for his wedding with Mary I of England. The knowledge of Britain which he acquired during his 14 months' stay there shows in his later writing. In 1555-1558, Bernardino de Escalante participated in the war in Flanders, and fought at St. Quentin. It is not known whether he returned to Spain in 1559 (during which year his father died, the Peace of Cateau-Cambr√©sis was signed, and Philip II returned to Spain), or stayed in Flanders until the end of the mop-up operations in January 1561. Soon after returning to Spain, Escalante felt that the period of European wars was over, and he also deserved a peaceful life, perhaps as a scholar or ecclesiastic. He went to study, although which university he attended is unknown. It is known that in the 1570s he enjoyed a benefice at a Laredo church, and served as the commissar of the Spanish Inquisition for the Kingdom of Galicia, often making business trips to Lisbon and Sevilla. BIOGRAF√çA DE BERNARDINO DE ESCALANTE At some point he was apparently transferred to Sevilla, then Spain's main port for the America trade; in 1581, he was an inquisitor in that city, and was also the majordomo of the Archbishop of Seville, Rodrigo de Castro Osorio. Spanish archives contain memorials written by Escalante for Philip II, his ministers and top archbishops, dated between 1585 and 1605. They discuss a variety of geopolitical issues, in particular related to the uneasy Anglo-Spanish relations, and, according to the 20th-century historian J.L. Casado Soto (who published these documents in 1995), were studied by \\"Philip the Prudent\\" and his officials.; see also the table of content of the volume. Discurso de la navegacion Folios 61 (verso) and 62 (recto) of the Discurso. See the examples of (corrupted) Chinese characters said to mean \\"heaven\\" and \\"king\\" Of particular historical interest is Escalante's first published book, Discurso de la navegacion que los Portugueses hacen a los Reinos y Provincias de Oriente, y de la noticia que se tiene de las grandezas del Reino de la China (Discourse of the navigation made by the Portuguese to the kingdoms and provinces of the Orient, and of the existing knowledge of the greatness of the Kingdom of China). Published in Sevilla in 1577, it became, according to Donald F. Lach, the second European book primarily dedicated to China, after Gaspar da Cruz' Tratado das cousas da China (1569). =Content of the Discurso and its sources= Escalante Discurso was a fairly small book, 100 folios (i.e., 200 pages in the modern system of page-counting) in octavo with wide margins. It can be conceptually divided into two parts. The first 5 chapters (folios 1-28) cover the history of Portuguese explorations along the route from the Iberian Peninsula to the South-East Asia. The remaining chapters (chap. 6-16, on folios 28-99) attempt a systematic description of China - its geography, economy, culture etc., to the (rather limited) extent known at the time to the Europeans (primarily Portuguese). The last folio (100) contains a brief description of the author's sources. Escalante is not known to have traveled to China. As he explains on the last page of his Discurso, his work is primarily that of synthesis. His literary sources were primarily Portuguese, viz. the above mentioned 1569 book by the Dominican Gaspar de Cruz (who had preached in Guangzhou for a month), and the coverage of China in the 3rd D√©cada of the D√©cadas da √Åsia by Jo√£o de Barros (the 3rd D√©cada was published in 1563; Barros never went to Asia either, but in his Lisbon office had access to Chinese books and a literate Chinese slave who was able to read and interpret them for him.Barros mentions the help of a Chinese person in the \\"interpreting\\" an atlas and other books: P. 189 in a later edition of the 3rd D√©cada]). Escalante had also been interviewing Portuguese merchants who had traveled to the China coast, and even some \\"people of China\\" who had come to Spain (\\"los mesmos naturales Chinas que an venido √† Espa√±a\\"). =Influence of the book= Unlike da Cruz's treatise, which apparently remained fairly obscure outside of Portugal, Escalante's book was quickly translated to other European languages. The English translation, by John Frampton, appeared in 1579, under the title A discourse of the Navigation which the Portugales doe Make to the Realmes and Provinces of the East Partes of the Worlde, and of the knowledge that growes by them of the great thinges, which are in the Dominion of China. Escalante's Discurso was one of the main sources for a much bigger book: Juan Gonz√°lez de Mendoza's Historia de las cosas m√°s notables, ritos y costumbres del gran reyno de la China (1585), which became Europe's standard reference on China for several decades. =Chinese language and characters in the Discurso= Folio 62, verso. See the (corrupted) character Âüé (city) Chapter XI of the Discurso discusses Chinese writing system, as well as education in China. While Escalante's description of the Chinese writing is generally similar to that given by da Cruz (absence of a phonetic alphabet; around 5000 different characters, each representing not just a syllable, but a particular meaning; usefulness of the written languages for communication between people who speak mutually incomprehensible languages of China, or even languages of other nearby countries such as Japan, Ryukyu, and Vietnam; writing in vertical columns), there are also significant differences. While da Cruz gives a first-hand account of the \\"purser\\" of a Chinese boat explaining to him the essentials of the writing system (after he had finished writing a note to the Vietnamese port authorities), Escalante gives an abstract textbook-type description. da Cruz gives the correct pronunciation (tiem) of one character (the one with the meaning \\"heaven\\" - i.e., obviously, Â§©, whose modern Pinyin transcription is tian), but does not actually show the characters. Escalante's book shows 3 sample characters, even if quite deformed and hardly recognizable, while his phonetic values are harder to interpret. Escalante's sample of characters is not the earliest known example of hanzi/kanji printed in a European book: the earliest published examples known to researchers appeared in a collection of Jesuit letters from Asia printed in Portugal in 1570; however, those were drawn from a Japanese, rather than Chinese, context.Jo√£o Soares,Bispo de Coimbra (ed. com.), Cartas que os padres e irm√°os da Companhia de Jesus,que andao nos Reynos de Iap√°o escreuer√°o aos da mesma Companhia da India,e Europa,des do anno de.1549 ate o de.66.

This page has links to the actual publication, and reference to the research paper that discusses its priority: Oskar Nachod, \\"Die ersten Kenntnisse chinesischer Schriftzeichen im Abendlande\\". In: Hirth Anniversary Volume. Asia Major, Introductory Volume (Leipzig,n.d. [1923]), pp. 235-273, especially p. 239 f. concurs with this view. The letter in question is one sent from Japan by the Jesuit Balthasar Gago, dated 23 September 1555; the actual page with the six Japanese characters is 106 verso, and the same words in hiragana follow on the next page: folio 106 verso and 107 recto Escalante's sample became quite influential, primarily via the two publications that reproduced his discussion of the Chinese writing systems (including his characters): * Abraham Ortelius's atlas Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (1584 edition), where these examples appeared in the brief text accompanying Luis Jorg√© de Barbuda's map of China,. Barbuda's map is reproduced as one of the plates between pages 752-753. * Mendoza's Historia ... de la China (1585), whose chapter on Chinese writing is based on Escalante.See Mendoza's text, in English translation, in: . Reprint of the 1588 English edition, edited by Sir George T. Staunton, Bart.; introduction by Richard Henry Major As the characters given by Escalante (and faithfully reproduced by Barbuda and Mendoza) are quite deformed, there has been a fair amount of discussion among commentators and translators of their works as to what their original form was. * The first character, said to mean \\"heaven\\" and have the sound value Guant, is, according to the 1853 Hakluyt Society commentators, George Staunton and R.H.

Life The son of Legh Watson of Lyme Handley in the parish of Prestbury, Cheshire, by his wife Hester, daughter of John Yates of Swinton, Lancashire, he was born at Lyme Handley on 26 March 1725, and educated at the grammar schools of Eccles, Wigan and Manchester. He matriculated from Brasenose College, Oxford, 8 April 1742, graduating B.A. 1745 and M.A. 1748. On 27 June 1746 he was elected to a Cheshire fellowship of his college. In December 1746 Watson took holy orders and entered on the curacy of Runcorn, Cheshire; but moved three months later to Ardwick, Manchester, where he was also tutor to the sons of Samuel Birch. From 1750 to 1754 he was curate of Halifax, Yorkshire, and in September 1754 was presented to the perpetual curacy of Ripponden in Halifax parish. On 17 August 1766 he was inducted to the rectory of Miningsby, Lincolnshire, which he resigned on 2 August 1769 on being promoted to the rectory of Stockport, Cheshire. It was believed that he owed his preferment to hardline Whig views. He died at Stockport on 14 March 1783. Works He was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1759, and contributed six papers on Roman and other antiquities to Arch√¶ologia. His major works were: The History and Antiquities of the Parish of Halifax, 1775, 4to, a second edition of which was begun in 1869 by F. A. Leyland, but left unfinished; and Memoirs of the Ancient Earls of Warren and Surrey and their Descendants, Warrington, 1782, 2 vols.. The latter was heavily illustrated attempt to prove that Watson's patron, Sir George Warren, was entitled to the earldom of Warenne and Surrey. Two earlier limited editions were printed in 1776 and 1779. He also published four pamphlets between 1751 and 1764, one of them criticising the ‚Äòabsurdities‚Äô of the Moravian hymn-book. He made extensive manuscript collections relating to local history, particularly of Cheshire, which were preserved, and were used by George Ormerod, John Parsons Earwaker, and other antiquaries. Gilbert Wakefield, who was Watson's curate at Stockport and married his niece, describes him as one of the hardest students he ever knew, as well as an agreeable man. In the Palatine Note-book (i. 24) is an account of a visit paid to Watson in 1780 by Thomas Barritt. Family He was twice married: first, on 1 June 1752, to Susanna, daughter of Samuel Allon, vicar of Sandbach, Cheshire; secondly, on 11 July 1761, to Ann, daughter of James Jacques of Leeds. He left one son by the first wife, and a son and daughter by the second.

The area of the district is . Its administrative center is the town of Velsk. Population: The population of Velsk accounts for 43.6% of the district's total population. History The area was originally populated by the Finno-Ugric peoples and then colonized by the Novgorod Republic. After the fall of Novgorod, the area became a part of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Historically, it was a part of Vazhsky Uyezd, a vast area including almost all of the basin of the Vaga River. Velsk was first mentioned in the chronicles in 1137, and was granted the status of a posad in 1550. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Archangelgorod Governorate. In 1780, the governorate was abolished and transformed into Vologda Viceroyalty. Vazhsky Uyezd was split, and the area of the current Velsky District became a part of the newly established Velsky Uyezd. In 1796, Velsky Uyezd was transferred to Vologda Governorate and remained there until 1929, when several governorates were merged into Northern Krai. On July 15, 1929, the uyezds were abolished, and Velsky Uyezd was split into Velsky, Verkhovazhsky, and Ustyansky Districts. Velsky District became a part of Nyandoma Okrug of Northern Krai. In the following years, the first-level administrative division of Russia kept changing. In 1930, the okrug was abolished, and the district was subordinated to the central administration of Northern Krai. In 1931, Verkhovazhsky District was merged into Velsky District, and in 1935, it was reestablished. In 1936, the krai was transformed into Northern Oblast. In 1937, Northern Oblast was split into Arkhangelsk Oblast and Vologda Oblast. Velsky District remained in Arkhangelsk Oblast ever since. From 1929 to 1959 (with a brief break between 1931 and 1935), Rovdinsky District existed, with its administrative center located in Rovdino. It was initially formed as a part of Nyandoma Okrug on July 15, 1929, when Shenkursky Uyezd was split into Shenkursky and Rovdinsky Districts. On September 11, 1959, the district was abolished and split between Shenkursky and Velsky Districts; the district's administrative center Rovdino became a part of Shenkursky District. Geography The district is located in the valley of the Vaga River, a major left tributary of the Northern Dvina. It is split by the Vaga and its major tributaries, the Ustya (right, with the left tributary, the Kokshenga River), the Kuloy (right), the Puya (left), the Vel (left), and the Pezhma (left).

According to imam Fadil Murati, there are 50,000 Muslims in Vojvodina, of which 20,000 in Novi Sad.http://www.rtv.rs/sr_lat/politika/vojvodjanski-imam:-muslimani-u-srbiji- nisu-ravnopravni_208698.html Besides Muftiship of Novi Sad of the Islamic Community in Serbia, which includes most of the Muslims of Vojvodina, rival Islamic Community of Serbia is also nominally present in the region and it is organizationally divided into Med≈ælis of Baƒçka and Med≈ælis of Banat. History Muslims in some main cities of Vojvodina during Ottoman administration (16th-17th century) Islam appeared in the territory of present- day Vojvodina in the 16th century, when this area became part of the Ottoman Empire. Syrmia was part of the Ottoman Empire since 1526 (including the period of vassal Syrmian duchy of Radoslav ƒåelnik that existed from 1527 to 1530), while Baƒçka and Banat were included into Ottoman Empire later, in 1541-1545 (Baƒçka) and in 1552-1556 (Banat). Ottoman leader who conquered Banat was Muslim Serb Mehmed pa≈°a Sokoloviƒá, whose army included 8,000 janissaries and 100,000 akindjias, of whom 20,000 were Serbs. During the Ottoman administration in the Balkans and in the Pannonian Plain, many Serbs converted to Islam, which was a condition for advancement in the state service. Some Muslim Serbs were in high administrative positions, like bej Malkoviƒá, who was the first Ottoman administrator of Beƒçkerek or Hasan pa≈°a Predojeviƒá, who was administrator of the Sanjak of Segedin in 1592. During the time, descendants of Muslim Serbs developed a separate ethnic identity and today are known as Bosniaks. During the Ottoman administration, villages in Vojvodina were populated by Serbs, while cities were populated by ethnically and religiously diverse population which included Muslims (Turks, Muslim Serbs, Arabs), Serbs, Romani, Greeks, Cincars, Jews, etc. Some cities of Vojvodina were majority Serb, some majority Muslim, while some had mixed populations. All settlements had mosques, while important cities also had administrative buildings, baths, Muslim schools and other public buildings. Main street (ƒçar≈°ija) usually had main trading and manufacturing shops. City of Beƒçkerek in 1697-98, including mosque with minaret that dominating the city City of Sombor in 1698, including mosques with minarets and Christian church with tower that dominating the city According to the records, following important cities of Vojvodina had sizable Muslim populations in Ottoman times: * Mitrovica (modern Sremska Mitrovica) was an important Muslim city. According to 1572 data, its population included 598 Muslim and 18 Christian houses. City also had 17 mosques and did not had a Christian church. * Beƒçkerek (modern Zrenjanin) was one of the most important cities in Banat. Because local Serbs from Beƒçkerek helped Ottoman conquest of Banat, Mehmed pa≈°a Sokoloviƒá turned this city into his endowment (vakuf) and its citizens were liberated from all military taxes. City was divided into two parts (mahalas) - one Muslim and another Serb. * Sombor had 14 Muslim religious objects, of which 5 mosques and 9 mahala masjids. * Varadin (modern Petrovaradin) had Muslim majority in Ottoman times. In Podgraƒëe (oldest part of modern town), there was about 200 houses and mosque of Sulejman-han, while two smaller mosques also existed: mosque of Had≈æi-Ibrahim and mosque of Husein. Besides two Muslim quarters (mahalas), there was also a Christian quarter with 35 Serb houses. * Vr≈°ac was mainly populated by Muslims in Ottoman times. * Titel was populated by Muslim and Serb population. Ottoman Empire was divided into provinces (pashaluks or eyalets), which were divided into smaller units - sanjaks. In the territory of Banat there was a first- level Ottoman administrative unit, the Eyalet of Teme≈üvar, while Sanjak of Syrmia and Sanjak of Segedin existed in Syrmia and Baƒçka. Both sanjaks initially were part of the Eyalet of Budin, but Sanjak of Segedin was later included into the Eyalet of Egir. After Habsburg conquest of Vojvodina (late 17th and early 18th century), almost entire Muslim population left from this area. Some of the Muslim refugees were later resettled in Bosnia and Herzegovina, mainly in its northern part and in the vicinity of river Bosnia, where they were known as \\"Unƒëurovci\\" (\\"refugees from Hungary\\"). Their larger settlements had \\"urijas\\" (rough municipal terrains), like in Vojvodina. Habsburgs also destroyed almost all traces of Islamic culture in Vojvodina and first mosque in Vojvodina after Habsburg conquest was built only in 2008 in Subotica, after almost three centuries. Modern Muslim population of Vojvodina mostly descending from migrants who came to Vojvodina after World War II from Muslim areas of former Yugoslavia - Macedonia, Kosovo, Sand≈æak and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1991, Islamic Community of Vojvodina with seat in Novi Sad was formed. With the formation of the Islamic Community in Serbia (in 2007), Islamic Community of Vojvodina became its part and was officially named the Muftiship of Novi Sad. In April, 2009, there was a clash of two groups of Muslim believers in front of the masjid of Islamic community in Adamoviƒáevo Naselje in Novi Sad, when members of the rival Islamic Community of Serbia attempted to take over administrative offices of the Muftiship of Novi Sad and to replace imam Fadil Murati.http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2009&mm;=04‚ÖÜ=17&nav;_id=356054 Another clash between the two communities occurred in Beoƒçin in March, 2011.http://www.islamvojvodina.com/00home.htm Religious objects Masjid in Adamoviƒáevo Naselje in Novi Sad Muftiship of Novi Sad possesses the following religious objects: *Masjid in Adamoviƒáevo Naselje in Novi Sad, exists from 1979, *Masjid in Subotica, exists from 2001, *Masjid in Veliki Rit in Novi Sad, exists from 2005, *Masjid in Beoƒçin, exists from 2006, *Muhad≈æir Mosque in Subotica, built in 2008.

In 1961 the Italian art historian Roberto Longhi recognized it as by D√ºrer, and, a few years later, the work was acquired by the collection currently owning it.

The Range State School opened on 1 July 1909. In December 1909 it was renamed Rangeville State School. In 1955 William Brennan, Roman Catholic Bishop of Toowoomba, invited the Christian Brothers to establish a boys' school in eastern Toowoomba.

Edwards was a left-handed batsman who initially bowled left-arm medium pace before turning to slow left-arm orthodox. He was born in Merstham, Surrey. Having played for the Surrey Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship since 1907, although infrequently so, Edwards made his only first-class appearance for Surrey against Oxford University in 1909, taking 3 wickets in the match. He continued to play Minor Counties Championship matches for Second XI until 1911, after which he was released along with several other players and staff, after Surrey encountered financial difficulty. He joined Buckinghamshire for the 1914 Minor Counties Championship, making his debut against Wiltshire. This was to be the start of a prolific career for Buckinghamshire in Minor counties cricket, one in which he represented the county until 1946, with only World War I and World War II truncating his playing career. Edwards made 165 appearances for Buckinghamshire in the Minor Counties Championship. He finished his career with the county having taken 1,082 wickets at an impressive average of 10.91 runs. His most prolific season was in 1923, when in 10 matches he took 104 wickets at an average of 9.99. He was regarded by Sir Pelham Warner as one of the best slow-left arm bowlers in the country. His move down to Minor Counties cricket did not put an end to this first-class playing days. Edwards' next appearance in first-class cricket came for the Minor Counties cricket team against HDG Leveson-Gower's XI. He went wicket- less in the XI's first-innings, before taking 4 wickets in their second. He was selected to represent the Players in the annual Gentlemen v Players fixture in 1925. His next appearance came for the Minor Counties against the touring South Africans in 1929, bowling only 6 overs in the match without taking a wicket. That same season he appeared for the Minor Counties against Lancashire at Old Trafford, where he took the wicket of Thomas Halliday for the cost of 59 runs from 18 overs. His final first-class match turned out to be his most successful, which came against the West Indians in 1933. He took 8 wickets in the West Indians first-innings, for the cost of 98 runs. He followed this up by taking a further 2 in their second-innings, giving him a 10 wicket-haul in the match. Edwards also played non-county cricket, appearing as Haslingden Cricket Club's professional from 1925 to 1929. He also played for Slough Cricket Club, taking all 10 wickets in a match on three occurrences for the club. Following his retirement, he coached cricket at Eton, Uppingham and for 16 years at Millfield. He died in Winscombe, Somerset on 10 July 1970.

Simca had been established as a French subsidiary of Fiat and the Simca 6 was developed from the Simca 5 which itself had been a version of Fiat‚Äôs Topolino rebadged and manufactured in France as a Simca. With the launch, at the 1947 Paris Motor Show, of the Simca 6, the company‚Äôs Nanterre based development office demonstrated a hitherto unseen level of independent thinking for a Simca production model. The Simca was distanced from its Fiat origins by a modified ¬´ Americanised ¬ª front end, featuring a widened and lowered front grill, flanked by raised headlights integrated into the wing panels, along the lines featured by the then newly introduced Peugeot 203 and Renault 4CV. The rear overhang was extended with the addition of a small boot, accessible only from the interior of the car and almost entirely filled by the spare wheel. In addition to the small 2-door, 2-seat coup√© style body, a small van capable of carrying up to 250 kg was available. Claimed output from the 569 cm¬≥ engine was boosted from 12 to 16.5 bhp achieved at 4,400 rpm. The engine employed overhead valves operated with a side-mounted camshaft. The light-weight 6 inherited its predecessor‚Äôs excellent fuel economy, with 5 litres of fuel propelling it over a distance of 108 km, equivalent to more than 61 mpg (UK gallons). The advertised maximum speed of 90 or 95 km/h (56 or 59 mph) also reflected the car‚Äôs light build, and was considered excellent for a car of this size and price. In most respects, the principal mechanical elements followed conventional practice. The four speed gear box featured synchromesh on the top two ratios. Stopping power came from drum-brakes on all four wheels. Despite having its first public presentation at the 1947 Motor Show, the car got off to a slow start, with just 11 produced during the closing month of 1947 and 191 during the whole of 1948: during these years the older Simca 5 remained the company's smaller volume model. However, in 1949 the Simca 6 fulfilled its manufacturer's plans and replaced its predecessor. More than 16,000 Simca 6s were produced during its production run which came to an end in 1950: after this loyal Simca customers would need to upgrade to the larger (and far more commercially successful) Simca 8. Unlike its predecessor, the 6 was not seen as a commercial success, and it was not until 1961 that Simca would return to the small car sector (in French terms), with their Simca 1000. By the time the Simca 6 production run ended, the Italian Fiat Topolino on which it was based had also been upgraded: The Topolino C, arriving two years later than the Simca 6, featured the upgraded mechanical components first seen on the Simca, as well as a modern square front grill; but the Fiat offering came without the American style chrome of the Simca, and the Fiat's headlights were positioned at a lower level. In retrospect Italian sources tend to view the Simca 6 as a French version of the upgraded Fiat Topolino while French sources stress the independent development of the Simca.

Early life Arthur Elmore Bostwick was born on March 8, 1860 in Litchfield, Connecticut to David Elmore Bostwick (1821‚Äì1872) and Adelaide McKinley (1830‚Äì1900). His paternal grandparents were Joel Bostwick and Nancy Stone. His father died when he was 12, and his mother supplemented the family income by various means to afford his education at Litchfield Institute, and later at Yale University, where he received his BA in 1881, and his PhD degree in 1883. Career After graduating from Yale, He taught high school in Montclair, New Jersey, for two years, before engaging in literary work on Appletons' Cyclop√¶dia of American Biography, Appletons' Annual Cyclop√¶dia and Funk & Wagnall's Standard Dictionary. With his cousin John D. Champlin, he edited a popular Young Folks' Cyclopedia of Games and Sports (1890). He started his library career in 1895 as chief librarian at New York Free Circulating Library, where his former boss William W. Appleton (1845‚Äì1924) had founded and chaired the library committee. He viewed libraries as venues for popular education, in contrast with many librarians at that time, like John Shaw Billings, who viewed them as mainly for reference use. In 1899, he moved to the Brooklyn Public Library. He accomplished much, though civil service struggles persuaded him to move back to former position in 1901, and in a merger with New York Public Library he became chief of circulation, with Billings as director. Here too he accomplished a great deal, but struggles with Billings persuaded him to move on and accept the opportunity to head the Saint Louis Public Library in 1909. At St. Louis, he remained head librarian until 1938, and associate librarian until his death. He found the system with four branches, and expanded it to 19. In American National Biography, John Mark Tucker criticizes his service during World War I because he removed pro- German material from the library shelves. Joseph Alfred Borom√©, in Dictionary of American Biography, praises his liberality during this time because he refused to halt circulation of German books. Bostwick was president of the American Library Association 1907‚Äì08 and the American Library Institute 1909‚Äì11. In 1925, he visited China at the request of a library association there to inspect facilities and make recommendations. Personal life In 1885, he married Lucy Sawyer. They had three children.

The protests started as non- violent demonstrations in the cities of Negombo and Katunayake, however, they quickly turned violent, as the Sri Lanka Police struggled to contain the large crowds. On 30 May 2011, a 21-year-old man, Roshen Chanaka was killed by police gunfire. The death of Chanaka prompted widespread discontent with the Sri Lankan Police, and as a result, the Sri Lanka Army were deployed to deal with the developing situation.Haviland, C (2011), 'Sri Lankans protest over killing of co-worker', BBC News, 2 June, Retrieved 15 March 2020, Available at: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-13631758 The protests ended on 6 June with President Mahinda Rajapaksa announcing substantial amendments to the PSBP, which included a revised saving scheme for all workers in the FTZ. History In early May 2011, the Sri Lankan government was set to pass a Private Pension Bill that would break down fund contributions into three separate deposits; for employees, migrant workers and the self employed.Ahmad, K. (2003) Sri Lankan health workers strike over 'salary anomaly'.(Medicine And Health Policy). The Lancet. [Online] 362 (9389), 1049‚Äì1049 While this was the official description provided by the Sri Lankan government, the proposed scheme was in fact formulated around employees allocating a fixed percentage of their income to a membership fund, which would make up their pension. Once this reserved money had been depleted, the employers were longer entitled to any pension and may have even be forced back into the workforce as a result.Sunil, W (2011), 'Sri Lankan government to reintroduce amended pension bill', International Committee of the Fourth International, 9 June, Retrieved 16 March 2020, Available at: https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2011/06/slpb-j09.html This was the primary motivation for the subsequent protests, the Sri Lankan Workforce, particularly those working in the FTZ, were disenchanted and demanded a fairer scheme that would ensure that their retirement is secure.Derks, A. (2010) Stitching Identities in a Free Trade Zone: Gender and Politics in Sri Lanka by Sandya Hewamanne. American Anthropologist. [Online] 112 (2), 328‚Äì329 The proposed bill would effectively introduce compulsory saving for retiring FTZ workers, a notion that spearheaded the protests to follow. Prathiba Mahanamahewa, a Sri Lankan Lawyer at the time, described the bill as unfair in an interview with AsiaNews; \\"But once they retire, and the money spent from the individual account is finished the person ceases to be a member of the fund, in short, they are no longer entitled to a pension. This is unacceptable, because everyone should be able to enjoy life after their retirement.\\" Both employers and employees expressed disdain for the proposed bill, which would decrease their base salaries by 2%. A female garment worker in the Katunayake FTZ stated during the protest; \\"They are going to give a pension to us only at the age of 60. The girls come to the FTZ to earn some money for their marriage dowry. After working about five years, they get their provident fund and the gratuity fund for that. We are not prepared to give that money to the government after shedding sweat for years\\". Protests FTZ workers began non-violent demonstrations on 24 May 2011 in Negombo and Katunayake. Approximately 200,000 FTZ workers, mostly female garment workers, marched in the streets chanting and expressing their discontent with the government's new pension bill with a number of banners. The protestors tore down a large picture of President Mahinda Rajapaske at the Katunayake Junction. The protestors expressed their discontent with the Rajapaske government with a number of chants which included; \\"Ask the Great King [Rajapakse] to come here and answer these questions! Ask the labour minister to come and answer these questions!‚Äù \\"Whose force is this! The workers' force!‚Äù. While the protests were originally intended to be non-violent, as police attempted to contain the protests in the following days, the large crowds became increasingly more violent. Outnumbered, the police were forced to physically separate the crowds, as they were disrupting traffic and other workers in the area. The police fired intimidation shots to disperse the large crowds, however, they were using live ammunition.Perera, A (2011), 'SRI LANKA: A Life Lost in Protest Against Pension Bill', Inter Press Service News Agency,10 June, Retrieved 16 March, Available at: http://www.ipsnews.net/2011/06/sri-lanka-a- life-lost-in-protest-against-pension-bill/ On 30 May, Roshen Chanaka, a 21-year-old FTZ worker, was shot by police on the streets of Katunayake. Chanaka's death sparked widespread outrage amongst the already disenchanted protestors as the level of violence at each protest began to increase dramatically. Police in the areas were now intent on breaking up the protests and were more willing to use violent dispersion tactics. Retired Sri Lanka High Court judge Mahanama Tilakaratne was tasked with leading a commission into the events of Chanaka's death in 2017. Through his research he contended that the death of Chanaka could have easily been avoided through legitimate orders from Sri Lankan police hierarchy. Tilakaratne's findings also revealed that the police acted with extreme prejudice against the protesting FTZ workers, many of the police officers were using excessive force with weapons that included iron rods, chains and clubs. The police were also accused of beating women and children in the protests, as well as stealing personal items from the protestors. It was also concluded that over 800 police officers failed to wear their identification numbers on their uniforms during the protests.1\\\\. Berenger, L (2017),‚Äô SHOOTING AT FTZ WORKERS IN SRI LANKA: \\"POLICE BEHAVED LIKE HOOLIGANS\\"‚Äô, Sri Lanka Brief, 23 July, Retrieved 28 May, Available at: https://srilankabrief.org/2017/07/shooting-at-ftz-workers-in- sri-lanka-police-behaved-like-hooligans/ Tilakaratne described the police's conduct as \\"deplorable'; \\"The report further states \\"In the circumstances, Police Officers acted contrary to the law, the superior officers were indifferent and failed to issue proper orders which enabled those of lower ranks to behave like thugs. Behaviour of the workers inside the Zone was such that Police in the circumstances acted in excess of the powers given to them by law, and deserve to be punished\\". Following the death of Chanaka, the Sri Lanka Army were deployed by President Rajapaske to end the protests. The Sri Lanka Army were effective in their ability to diffuse the developing situation. The Army set up multiple physical deterrents including blockades and reinforced patrols which substantially decreased the influx of protestors into Negombo and Katunayake. Impact Roshen Chanaka's death had a substantial impact on the subsequent events of the protests. The Sri Lankan government issued an apology regarding his death, and soon authorised for the Sri Lankan Army to replace the police force in dealing with the protestors. The Army were substantially more effective in dealing with the situation than the police, crowds were quick to disperse and compliant with the Army's directives. As a result, the protests came to an end on 6 June. A public funeral service was held for Chanaka towards the end of the protests. The funeral was attended by approximately 5000 FTZ workers as well as Chanaka's family and friends. The parents of Chanaka were vocal about their discontent regarding the proposed private pension bill, and spoke about this in depth during the funeral. Towards the end of the service, the funeral had effectively become a non-violent protest of its own, with thousands chanting and rallying against the Rajapaske government. The Army was on alert at the funeral, and was able to quickly diffuse the protest. The impacts of the protests also rippled into the Sri Lankan labour market and economy, with almost all FTZ's shut down during the two-weeks. 40,000 FTZ workers walked out of their factories following Chanaka's death, with many factories unable to fully recover from the mass walkout. It was estimated that the protests cost the Sri Lankan Economy more than 579 million Rupee (Approximately US$7.5 million).Hewamanne, S (2012) Negotiating sexual meanings: Global discourses, local practices, and Sri Lanka‚Äôs Free Trade Zone (FTZ) factory workers. Ethnography. [Online] 13 (3), 352‚Äì374. The protests themselves shut down 70% of factories within Sri Lanka's Free Trade Zones and also blocked access to Bandaranaike International Airport for a period of five days. Result of Protests The protests resulted in an immediate response by the Sri Lankan government. On 9 June, the government elected to suspend the proposed bill and seek to reintroduce the legislation with new amendments and consultation with relevant trade unions that represent the FTZ in Sri Lanka. A new bill was to be formulated in consultation with trade unions and leaders within Free Trade Zones. On 7 June, the Rajapaske government conducted a meeting with representatives from Free Trade Zones in Negombo and Katunayake as well as trade union officials to formulate a decision. The Sri Lankan Government eventually passed a revised pension bill that included increased employee benefits in retirement, as well as removing the previous compulsory saving that was proposed. The amended bill also introduced a monthly instalment payment program for retiring FTZ workers. This method granted employees greater autonomy over their retirement funds. The protests were a success for members of the Sri Lankan FTZ. Trade union officials were also pleased with the government's prompt action following the damaging protests. The salaries of those working in the FTZ became completely accessible. The revised pension bill has seen no further adjustments as of 2020. Legacy FTZ discontent still exists in parts of Sri Lanka today, the Sri Lankan government still struggles to from a positive relationship with its FTZ workers. This is prevalent in the fact that in 2018, workers at a glove factory in Katunayake, the same site of the 2011 protests, began protesting against FTZ unions for alleged labour abuses. FTZ workers have cited this discontent with the government on multiple occasions, with disease and poor living conditions said to be two of the main issues that FTZ workers have faced in recent years. In July 2016, approximately 3000 workers in Sri Lanka's FTZ protested against anti-union discrimination. A spokesperson from the protest stated: \\"Protesting workers demand that employers stop threats of physical attacks, recognize unions as collective bargaining agents, reinstate all employees dismissed for trade union activities, stop employing precarious workers with the intention to bust union activities, and punish the officials engaged in sexual harassment\\".Ainsworth, E (2016), 'Sri Lanka: thousands protest against anti- union discrimination at FTZs', Industriall, 6 August, Retrieved 29 May, Available at: http://www.industriall-union.org/sri-lanka-trade-unions-protest- against-anti-union-discrimination-at-ftzs In January 2019, workers in the Sri Lankan FTZ protests against numerous cases of unfair dismissal.

On the way up, George, a claustrophobic, panics and, on the 49th floor, Madeline hits the emergency stop button to torment him. Henry presses the lobby floor button, but the elevator only descends by a few feet and stops. Henry presses the call button and alerts security. When the elevator fails to move, security dispatches a maintenance crew. While waiting for help, the group talk with each other. Jane, who says that her son died in Iraq in the last year, confronts Henry and says her husband lost everything because Barton Investments pushed junk bonds. In her anger, she planned on \\"making a point\\" at the party. Suddenly, Jane collapses and dies of a heart attack, but before she dies, she admits that she has a bomb. After arguing, Celine checks Jane's body and finds the bomb secured around her waist by means of a bike lock. Don tries to look for a way out via the ceiling, to no avail. Don stops Celine from smoking, and she asks when he became a concerned father. Maureen overhears and demands an explanation; Don confesses he is possibly the father of Celine's unborn child. Maureen is distraught. Henry once again calls security, but he angers them and they stop responding. Maureen documents the events with her phone and sends them to her television station, which picks up the story and starts running the footage she has captured. The others force open the doors, and Don attempts to climb out. The opening is too small, but he uses Jane's walking stick to press the elevator call button. At the same time, Madeline presses several buttons on the control panel. The elevator's brakes deactivate, and Don's arm is severed as the elevator drops several floors. Mohammed uses a necktie as a tourniquet to slow the blood loss. Henry is left confused and dazed. George suggests that they pry open the doors again to see if the elevator has lined up with a floor in their drop, but they discover that the elevator stopped between floors, much to their dismay. Martin brings up the local news on his phone, and they watch a live interview with the bombmaker. The man was good friends with Jane's son and felt that he owed their family. He estimates it will detonate in ten minutes. Desperate, George suggests dismembering Jane's body to separate her from the bomb and throw it down the shaft. When he loses his nerve, an angry Henry takes over and promises each person $1 million if they survive. While they are trying to tear the bomb off, a security guard on the intercom tells them that the bomb squad is there and lowering the elevator. They open the doors, make a small opening, and help all but Martin escape. When only Martin is left, he knows that the opening is not big enough for him to fit through. George desperately orders the SWAT members to raise the elevator to rescue Martin. As they lower the elevator to the basement to get him out there, Martin weeps, knowing his death is imminent. Before the bomb explodes, he regains his composure and realizes he is the hero, as he helped everybody survive. Don is taken to hospital, and George asks Henry about the $1 million he promised each of the group, which he ignores. George and Mohammed have a brief discussion outside the building about what lies ahead for them. A news reporter asks George how he stayed so brave during the ordeal, to which George lies and said he had to stay calm for everybody there, then races off after a phone call from his wife, who had no idea what happened, to pick something up from the store. Mohammed looks on.

Regalado. The theme of the novel revolves around love, romance, treachery, and endurance. In the novel, Regalado depicted the City of Manila during the American occupation of the Philippines but before World War II. Sampagitang Walang Bango was one of the novels Regalado had written during the Golden Age of the Tagalog Novel (1905‚Äì1935). Plot Set during the second decade of American occupation and colonization of the Philippines, Regalado invented in Sampagitang Walang Bango the characters Bandino, Nenita, Pakito, and Liling. Bandino was the playboy husband of Nenita. The alienated Nenita, weakened and rebelling against Bandino's indecencies, succumbed to an extramarital affair with Pakito, a lawyer. Pakito was a man engaged to be married to Liling, a modest and demure woman. After discovering Nenita's affair with Pakito, Bandino tried to commit suicide. Only Bandino's daughter was able to stop him from shooting himself. Bandino, with his daughter, left the Philippines. Nenita, already abandoned by her husband, was also left by Pakito to fend for herself. Description Sampagitang Walang Bango was published in Manila by P. Sayo. Apart from being a narrative about infidelity, particularly in the so-called wealthy and high- class people of Manila, the 271-page novel described a Philippine society when its traditional Filipino values were being tarnished and windswept by the norms and lifestyles from the Western world. Sampagitang Walang Bango was written by Regalado during a time when the \\"highly westernized middle and upper classes\\" of Filipinos were beginning to appear and establish themselves in Philippine society. According to literary critic Soledad Reyes, Sampagitang Walang Bango presented scenes depicting the lifestyle of wealthy Filipinos during the \\"second decade of American rule\\" and the \\"deepening American colonization\\" of the Philippines. Examples are the Manila Carnival (a yearly \\"Mardi Gras\\" before the onset of Easter held in the Philippines from 1908‚Äì1939, with a series of nine balls (formal dance parties) that were presided over by the queen of the carnival), lavish parties, outings during the weekends, and the fashion trends of the times. The mixed themes of \\"love, self-control, and infidelity\\" were portrayed by the author as events that happened within a \\"carnival-like milieu\\". The 2001 edition of the novel was published by the Ateneo de Manila University Press, and was edited with an introduction written by literary critic Roberto T. A√±onuevo. A variation of Sampagitang Walang Bango is Regalado's Anak ng Dumalaga (Child of the Pullet). Film adaptation Sampagitang Walang Bango was adapted into a film in 1937. The film version was directed by Ferm√≠n Barva for Filippine Films and starred Leopoldo Salcedo and Angelita \\"Rhumba\\" Rey.

He played representative level rugby union (RU) for New Zealand, Auckland, and at club level for Ponsonby RFC. He also played representative level rugby league (RL) for New Zealand and Australasia, as well as at club level for Wigan, as a forward (prior to the specialist positions of; ), during the era of contested scrums, and coached club level rugby union (RU) for Grammar RFC. Early years Francis was born in Wanganui, New Zealand. He was educated at Auckland Grammar.Arthur Francis stats.allblacks.com Rugby union career Francis played club rugby union for Ponsonby RFC, and was part of successive Auckland Rugby Union championships between 1908 and 1910. Francis made his Auckland d√©but in 1904 and scored a penalty in the 1905 Ranfurly Shield victory over Wellington. Francis made his All Blacks d√©but in 1905 against Australia and became an automatic selection, playing in a total of ten Test matches in the next five years. In 1910 Francis and teammate George A. Gillett rescued Anglo-Welsh Lions player Percy Down, who had fallen into the sea, keeping him afloat until a rope was lowered from the ship upon which Down was about to return to Great Britain. Rugby league career Francis switched codes in 1911 during the season, joining the Auckland Rugby League competition. He played for Newton Rangers and scored a try in his debut game in the code. He represented Auckland and New Zealand in his inaugural season, touring Australia, before being selected to be part of the Australasia side that toured Great Britain at the end of the year. In 1912 he captained New Zealand on his second tour of Australia. However, halfway through the tour, Francis left the touring party to take up a contract with Wigan. Arthur Francis played as a forward, i.e. number 10, in Wigan's 21-5 victory over Rochdale Hornets in the 1912 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1912‚Äì13 season at Weaste, Salford, on Wednesday 11 December 1912.

He studied at the National Academy of Design in New York City and in Rome, Italy. He expatriated to Rome in 1841 when he was appointed U.S. Consul to Ancona, in the Papal States. thumbnailleft Portrait of James E. Freeman by Charles Loring Elliott, 1846, oil on canvas, 30 1/8 x 25 1/8 in. (76.5 x 63.8 cm). National Academy, New York Early life and career in America Freeman was born on Indian Island, in New Brunswick, Canada, less than one mile distant from Eastport, Maine, where his parents lived. His father, Joshua Edwards Freeman, was a merchant and navigated the waters between the bustling seaports frequently with his wife Eliza Morgan Freeman. In 1816 Freeman was sent to live with relatives in rural Otsego County, New York, but little else is known of his early life or his family circumstances. In 1826 Freeman moved to New York City in order to study painting. There he encountered William Dunlap, a noted portraitist and history painter, whose works the young Freeman could have seen in upstate New York. Dunlap encouraged Freeman to enroll in the National Academy of Design in New York City, a nascent institution of which Dunlap was a founding member. Freeman joined the National Academy of Design's Antique School in its inaugural year, 1826, alongside two other notable American painters, William Sidney Mount and William Page. Freeman debuted at the National Academy of Design's Fourth Annual Exhibition in 1829 with Portrait of a Gentleman (unlocated). He was elected an Associate Member of the National Academy of Design on May 14, 1831 and elected to the prestigious position of Academician on May 1, 1833. By 1831 Freeman began to paint fancy pictures, typically life-sized, single-figure (occasionally multi-figure) paintings which were similar in appearance to portraits but possessed a greater expressiveness and which frequently depicted hired models rather than paying sitters. Many of Freeman‚Äôs associates, including Samuel F. B. Morse, Charles Cromwell Ingham, Henry Inman, Mount, and Page, were also painting fancy pictures, as was Washington Allston, who began painting them in the first decade of the century. Freeman would also have been familiar with 18th-century European fancy pictures by Joshua Reynolds, Jean- Baptiste Greuze, and Thomas Gainsborough, as well as the 17th-century secular works by Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo that inspired the genre. Like many aspiring American painters of the era, however, Freeman continued to rely upon bespoke portraiture for his livelihood and became semi-itinerant in the 1830s, seeking and fulfilling commissions in Cooperstown, New York, Litchfield, Connecticut, New Orleans, Louisiana, and Utica, New York, from his home base in New York City and, later, Albany, New York. Financed by his enlightened patron base in Albany, led by John Adams Dix, Freeman embarked for England in September 1836. He carried letters of introduction from Morse to the esteemed Anglo-American painter Charles Robert Leslie in London and the eminent Danish neoclassical sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen in Rome. Traveling through England, thence to Paris, Marseilles, and the Italian port of Leghorn, Freeman arrived in Rome on November 30, 1836, and took quarters at Via Laurina 97. There were only two other American artists concurrently residing at Rome, the neoclassical sculptor Thomas Crawford and the painter Frederick William Philip. Freeman and Crawford were allowed to attend the life school of the so-called English Academy, which convened nightly to work from nude models in the deconsecrated church of San Giovanni della Ficozza at Via dei Maroniti 29. Their British peers there included Morris Moore, Patrick Allan-Fraser, Edward Matthew Ward, and the brothers Robert Scott Lauder and James Eckford Lauder. James E. Freeman, Masaniello, 1837, oil on canvas, 29 1/2 x 24 5/8 in. (74.9 x 62.5 cm). Private collection During his brief nine-month sojourn in Rome Freeman painted Masaniello (private collection), a fancy picture of the Italian folk hero Tommaso Aniello, known as Masaniello, who led a successful uprising against Spanish rule of Naples in 1647 and became a potent symbol of Italian unification. Freeman's choice of subject matter reveals his own early support for the cause of the Italian Risorgimento.Freeman departed Rome in September 1837 and is recorded back in Albany, New York that December. Consulship and political activities Freeman's return to the United States proved disappointing, as he received neither the financial support nor critical approbation that he had anticipated. Assisted by his Albany political connections, namely Dix, Horatio Seymour, Thurlow Weed, and William H. Seward, he lobbied the administration of Martin Van Buren for a consulship to enable him to settle permanently in Italy. In April 1840 he was officially named the first U.S. Consul to Ancona, part of the Papal States. He sailed from New York City in January 1841, received his exequatur in Rome that spring, and visited Ancona that July. His position was essentially a sinecure, however, and Freeman soon designated a local man to serve as his vice-consul and returned to Rome to pursue his art. He never went to Ancona again. On May 14, 1848 Freeman married Horatia Augusta Latilla, an Anglo-Italian sculptor in Florence. They made their home together at Via Capo le Case 68 in Rome, which also contained their studios. Domestic bliss and artistic pursuits were marginalized shortly thereafter, however, as a series of revolts spread throughout the peninsula in the wake of the French Revolution. Rome became embroiled after the assassination of Pope Pius IX's prime minister, Pellegrino Rossi, on November 15, 1848. Soon thereafter the pope fled Rome and the Roman Republic was established in February 1849, the volatile situation proved overwhelming to the U.S. Consul to Rome, Nicholas Brown III, and he enlisted Freeman's assistance, since he still held the title of U.S. Consul to Ancona. When French troops bombarded Rome in June 1849 in order to restore the pope's temporal authority over the city, most foreigners fled the violence and turmoil, but Freeman remained. His firsthand chronicle of the siege was published in the New York Evening Post that August. Within days after the French breached the city walls on June 30, 1849 and occupied Rome, Consul Brown claimed to be ill and hastily departed his post, appointing Freeman acting consul in his absence. Freeman embraced the opportunity to assist those who had fomented and abetted the revolution. He personally erected the American flag on Margaret Fuller's balcony on Piazza Barberini, after her pro- Italian, anti-French dispatches to the New York Tribune placed her in danger. He hid the apostate Italian priest Alessandro Gavazzi in his home for three nights and helped him escape to England.John W. King, Alessandro Gavazzi: A Biography (London: J. W. King, 1857), 41. Most significantly, Freeman contrived a sort of improvised passport for thousands of Italians who faced certain death if captured by the French or Austrians, ensuring their safe passage out of Italy and, ostensibly, to America. All of this he apparently did out of personal conviction and with the expectation that his diplomatic post would immunize him from prosecution; however, his consulship to Ancona was suddenly revoked and given to the sculptor Joseph Mozier and a new consul replaced Brown at Rome. Fortunately, the American Charg√© d'Affaires Lewis Cass Jr. attached Freeman to his legation, thereby guaranteeing he could stay on at Rome as an artist after the pope was reinstalled. Artistic career in Italy James E. Freeman, Costume Picture, 1857, oil on canvas, 59 1/4 x 45 1/2 in. (150.3 x 115.5 cm). Private collection For more than forty years, Freeman remained a prominent fixture of the vibrant art scene in Rome, painting fancy pictures of humble Italian contadini, impish street urchins, Madonna-like rustic beauties, and blind mendicants for an international clientele. These sentimental character studies were appealing for their artless beauty, an ideal closely allied to the 18th-century cult of sensibility, which advocated that strong emotional responses to visual and literary stimuli could help foster compassion and ethical behavior. Freeman‚Äôs dedication to the communicative potential of the fancy picture resulted in a remarkably cohesive oeuvre that constitutes his lasting legacy to American art. In many of his works Freeman expressed his ardent support for nationhood and religious freedom in Italy, as well as abolition and tolerance in the United States. In his painting The Savoyard Boy in London (1865, Smithsonian American Art Museum). Freeman makes parallels between Italy‚Äôs internal struggle for unification with the American Civil War. James E. Freeman, The Savoyard Boy in London, 1865, oil on canvas, 54 1/2 x 43 3/4 in. (138.4 x 111.2 cm). Smithsonian American Art Museum Artistically, Freeman reached the pinnacle of his career by mid-century. American tourists, however, were slow to return to Rome after the political tumult that defined the late 1840s, so he began to cultivate a new base of European‚éØprimarily English‚éØclients, who already recognized and esteemed the idiom of the fancy picture in which he specialized. Freeman's fortunes continued to decline in the 1860s as aesthetic tastes changed and his physical abilities‚éØhis eyesight most notably‚éØdeclined with age. He increasingly devoted his energies to literary pursuits, beginning with Photographs from Recent Pictures by J. E. Freeman, N.A. (1870), in which he coupled photographs after his paintings with prose and poetry, and culminating with two volumes of memoirs. Memoirs In 1877 Freeman published the first volume of his memoirs, entitled Gatherings from an Artist‚Äôs Portfolio, followed in 1883 with Gatherings from an Artist‚Äôs Portfolio in Rome. As their titles suggest, the collection of anecdotes and stories that fill the two volumes of Gatherings is similar to the miscellaneous scenes that fill an artist‚Äôs sketchbooks. Freeman alternated chapters on some of the eminent people he knew in Rome, such as John Gibson, William Makepeace Thackeray, Crawford, and the Italian Princess Borghese (n√©e Guindalina Talbot) with others devoted to the contadini who populated his fancy pictures, such as Giovannina of Saracinesca, the young boy Angelo, and ‚ÄúLa Nonna,\\" who he called \\"my venerable model.‚Äù The memoirs proved popular with both the public and the critics, and they were likened to Nathaniel Hawthorne‚Äôs The Marble Faun and Our Old Home, as well as to William Wetmore Story‚Äôs Roba di Roma. Today Freeman's Gatherings continue to be consulted by scholars for their unique insight and invaluable historical information about the international art scene at Rome in the 19th century.

It led to the deaths of five people, and the hospitalisation of twenty others, some in critical condition, after consuming alcoholic drinks mixed with methanol, served at the yacht's bar. A consignment of fake whisky had been supplied by a distributor with a fictitious address. Incident The Russian women were employed as managers and tour guides with Russian travel agencies, and came to Bodrum in the western Turkish Riviera for a promotion trip organized by Russian tourist company Mostravel. Together with Russian employees of local Turkish travel companies, the women took a yacht voyage along the coast of Turkish Riviera in southwestern Turkey, a popular tour known locally as \\"Blue Cruise\\" (). The yacht Orhan-5 was chartered for this purpose, and sailed from May 26‚Äì27, 2011 with some 60 Russian tourists aboard. The mass poisoning occurred during a party on the night of May 27 aboard the yacht. Twenty passengers suffered from alcohol poisoning after consuming drinks served from the yacht's bar. The Russian women enjoyed drinking whiskey with cola. Anastasia Lavrenko, one of the young women aboard, told a Russian newspaper that they all had 10-12 glasses of cocktails. She added that even though she felt the alcohol tasted unusually strong, she did not realise anything. Arriving in Antalya the next morning, the tourists went to their hotel to rest for the next day's flight back home. Many of them experienced motion sickness, vomiting and loss of consciousness. The victims were hospitalised and diagnosed with alcohol poisoning. Victims Some twenty Russian citizens and a Turkish man were affected by alcohol poisoning. Three women died, others were hospitalized in Antalya and Denizli, with six placed in intensive care stations in critical condition. On May 30, Marina Sheveleva (), born in 1989, died as the first victim at a hospital in her country, after her condition worsened during the flight to Moscow. Two other Russian citizens, Maria Shalyapina (), born in 1983, and Aigul Zalayeva (), born in 1991, died in the following days at the hospital of Akdeniz University in Antalya. On the night of June 5, 2011, 28-year-old Alexandr Zhuchkov () died in the hospital of Pamukkale University in Denizli, where he had been in intense supportive care since May 28. He became the fourth Russian victim. His body was transferred to Russia by the Russian Consulate. Twenty-two-year-old Viktoria Nikolaeva (), who was being treated in the intensive station of Akdeniz University's hospital in Antalya, died due to brain damage in the evening hours of June 20, 2011. The fifth victim died in the early morning hours of July 4, 2011. Investigation Turkish police immediately launched an investigation into the mass poisoning. Samples of alcohol were taken from the yacht for analysis. The Investigation Committee of the Russian Federation also opened an investigation. It is believed that the whiskey served contained methanol, making the drink toxic. The Turkish Minister of Agriculture, who is also responsible for carrying out food safety control in the country, stated that the alcoholic beverage served on the yacht was supplied by the company \\"Jasmine\\", based in Northern Cyprus, and was imported by the company \\"Birlik Gƒ±da\\" in Ankara. About 12,000 bottles of fake whiskey labeled \\"Mister Burdon\\" were distributed in the provinces of Ankara, Mersin, Antalya and Muƒüla. Turkish police found out that the address of Birlik Gƒ±da was fictitious. The ministry stated that the methyl alcohol in the whiskey consumed was three times higher than normal. Police made 22 arrests and seized thousands of bottles of bootleg liquor.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13687187 References Alcohol poisoning Category:2011 health disasters Category:Accidental deaths in Turkey Category:Alcohol-related deaths in Turkey Category:21st century in Antalya Category:Bodrum Category:Crime in Turkey Category:Deaths from food poisoning Category:Food safety scandals Category:Health disasters in Turkey Category:Mass poisoning Category:Methanol poisoning incidents Category:Russian diaspora in Turkey Category:Tourism in Turkey Category:Turkish Riviera ","title":"2011 Turkish Riviera mass alcohol poisoning"},{"id":"31991725","text":"We Built a Fire is the second full-length album from Icelandic band Seabear.

When the process reaches the crossing point at a=50 at t\\\\approx3000, both the original process and its reflection (red curve) about the a=50 line (blue line) are shown. After the crossing point, both black and red curves have the same distribution. In the theory of probability for stochastic processes, the reflection principle for a Wiener process states that if the path of a Wiener process f(t) reaches a value f(s) = a at time t = s, then the subsequent path after time s has the same distribution as the reflection of the subsequent path about the value a. More formally, the reflection principle refers to a lemma concerning the distribution of the supremum of the Wiener process, or Brownian motion. The result relates the distribution of the supremum of Brownian motion up to time t to the distribution of the process at time t. It is a corollary of the strong Markov property of Brownian motion. Statement If (W(t): t \\\\geq 0) is a Wiener process, and a > 0 is a threshold (also called a crossing point), then the lemma states: : \\\\mathbb{P} \\\\left(\\\\sup_{0 \\\\leq s \\\\leq t} W(s) \\\\geq a \\\\right) = 2\\\\mathbb{P}(W(t) \\\\geq a) Assuming W(0) = 0 , due to continuity of Wiener process, each path (one sampled realization) of Wiener process on (0,t) which ends up at or above value/level/threshold/crossing point 'a' the time t (W(t) \\\\geq a) must have crossed a threshold 'a' ( W(t_a) = a) ) at some earlier time t_a \\\\leq t for the first time . (It can cross level 'a' multiple times on the interval (0,t), we take the earliest.) For every such path you can define another sampled path of Wiener process W' on (0,t) that is reflected or vertically flipped on the sub-interval (t_a,t) symmetrically around level 'a' from the original path.( a-W'(t)=W(t)-a ) That reflected path also reached value W'(t_a) = a on the interval (0,t) and is also a Wiener process or Brownian motion. Both original and reflected paths form set of paths that reach value 'a' on (0,t) and they are twice as many as those that end up at or above threshold 'a' (original path only) at time t. If each path is equally probable (imagine symmetric random walk from 0 on trees) then reaching threshold 'a' at any time on (0,t) is twice as likely as ending up at or above threshold 'a' at the time t. What about paths that reach level 'a' on (0,t) and then end up somewhere at value W(t) < a at the time t? Are they accounted for? Yes. There are exactly those reflected paths that are counted towards the number of the paths that reached threshold 'a' only and they are exactly as many as those that ended up above threshold 'a' at the time t. Once Wiener process reached threshold 'a' , then due to the symmetry there is an equal probability (p=0.5) it will end up above or below threshold 'a' at any future time t. So conditional probability: P(W(t) \\\\geq a  W(t_a)=a)=0.5 . Paths with W(t) < a that never reach threshold 'a' are never considered. In a stronger form, the reflection principle says that if \\\\tau is a stopping time then the reflection of the Wiener process starting at \\\\tau , denoted (W^\\\\tau(t): t \\\\geq 0), is also a Wiener process, where: : W^\\\\tau(t) = W(t)\\\\chi_\\\\left\\\\\\\\{t \\\\leq \\\\tau\\\\right\\\\\\\\} + (2W(\\\\tau) - W(t))\\\\chi_\\\\left\\\\\\\\{t > \\\\tau\\\\right\\\\\\\\} and the indicator function \\\\chi_{\\\\\\\\{t \\\\leq \\\\tau\\\\\\\\}}= \\\\begin{cases} 1, & \\\\text{if }t \\\\leq \\\\tau \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, & \\\\text{otherwise }\\\\end{cases} and \\\\chi_{\\\\\\\\{t > \\\\tau\\\\\\\\}} is defined similarly. The stronger form implies the original lemma by choosing \\\\tau = \\\\inf\\\\left\\\\\\\\{t \\\\geq 0: W(t) = a\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Proof The earliest stopping time for reaching crossing point a, \\\\tau_a := \\\\inf\\\\left\\\\\\\\{t: W(t) = a\\\\right\\\\\\\\} , is an almost surely bounded stopping time. Then we can apply the strong Markov property to deduce that a relative path subsequent to \\\\tau_a, given by X_t := W(t + \\\\tau_a) - a , is also simple Brownian motion independent of \\\\mathcal{F}^W_{\\\\tau_a} . Then the probability distribution for the last time W(s) is at or above the threshold a in the time interval [0,t] can be decomposed as : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbb{P}\\\\left(\\\\sup_{0\\\\leq s\\\\leq t}W(s) \\\\geq a\\\\right) & = \\\\mathbb{P}\\\\left(\\\\sup_{0\\\\leq s\\\\leq t}W(s) \\\\geq a, W(t) \\\\geq a\\\\right) + \\\\mathbb{P}\\\\left(\\\\sup_{0\\\\leq s\\\\leq t}W(s) \\\\geq a, W(t) < a\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\mathbb{P}\\\\left(W(t) \\\\geq a\\\\right) + \\\\mathbb{P}\\\\left(\\\\sup_{0\\\\leq s\\\\leq t}W(s) \\\\geq a, X(t-\\\\tau_a) < 0\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align}. By the tower property for conditional expectations, the second term reduces to: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbb{P}\\\\left(\\\\sup_{0\\\\leq s\\\\leq t}W(s) \\\\geq a, X(t-\\\\tau_a) < 0\\\\right) &= \\\\mathbb{E}\\\\left[\\\\mathbb{P}\\\\left(\\\\sup_{0\\\\leq s\\\\leq t}W(s) \\\\geq a, X(t-\\\\tau_a) < 0 \\\\mathcal{F}^W_{\\\\tau_a}\\\\right)\\\\right]\\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\mathbb{E}\\\\left[\\\\chi_{\\\\sup_{0\\\\leq s\\\\leq t}W(s) \\\\geq a} \\\\mathbb{P}\\\\left(X(t-\\\\tau_a) < 0 \\\\mathcal{F}^W_{\\\\tau_a}\\\\right)\\\\right]\\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\mathbb{P}\\\\left(\\\\sup_{0\\\\leq s\\\\leq t}W(s) \\\\geq a\\\\right) , \\\\end{align} since X(t) is a standard Brownian motion independent of \\\\mathcal{F}^W_{\\\\tau_a} and has probability 1/2 of being less than 0. The proof of the lemma is completed by substituting this into the second line of the first equation.M√∂rters, P.; Peres,Y. (2010) Brownian Motion, CUP. : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbb{P}\\\\left(\\\\sup_{0\\\\leq s\\\\leq t}W(s) \\\\geq a\\\\right) & = \\\\mathbb{P}\\\\left(W(t) \\\\geq a\\\\right) + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\mathbb{P}\\\\left(\\\\sup_{0\\\\leq s\\\\leq t}W(s) \\\\geq a\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbb{P}\\\\left(\\\\sup_{0\\\\leq s\\\\leq t}W(s) \\\\geq a\\\\right) &= 2 \\\\mathbb{P}\\\\left(W(t) \\\\geq a\\\\right) \\\\end{align}. Consequences The reflection principle is often used to simplify distributional properties of Brownian motion. Considering Brownian motion on the restricted interval (W(t): t \\\\in [0,1]) then the reflection principle allows us to prove that the location of the maxima t_\\\\text{max} , satisfying W(t_\\\\text{max}) = \\\\sup_{0 \\\\leq s \\\\leq 1}W(s) , has the arcsine distribution. This is one of the L√©vy arcsine laws.

His work has been displayed across three continents ‚Äì from the largest video screen on the planet in Times Square, New York, to the Royal Photographic Society's Print Exhibition in the Royal Albert Hall in London. With clients ranging from high- end hotel groups such as W Hotels and Shangri-La, to National Parks, to airlines and marketing companies, his work has a presence in many countries around the world in both advertising and collectible fine art prints. His signature iconic landscapes and cityscapes have been published by National Geographic and used by tourism boards around the globe, while he continues to sell limited edition prints to collectors worldwide. In 2016, his latest venture ‚Äì a collaboration with Minor Hotel Group ‚Äì resulted in his opening of the \\"world‚Äôs most exclusive photo gallery\\", on the Maldivian island of Huvafen Fushi, where visitors can only access the exhibition by seaplane or speedboat.  Early life  From an early age Reiffer developed his interest in photography through spending time with his father, watching him develop images in a self-built darkroom in their family home. Awards and recognition Reiffer is a Fellow of the British Institute of Professional Photography\\"Members, Paul Reiffer\\", British Institute of Professional Photography. and Associate of the Royal Photographic Society,\\"London Portfolio\\", The Royal Photographic Society. having been accepted by both organisations for direct entry at an Associate level due to the breadth of his existing portfolio. He was a finalist in the 2010 Landscape Photographer of the Year for his images of the British coastline and won awards for his portraiture work in the controversial BIPP Professional Photography Awards 2012. In 2015, he was presented with the UN/UNESCO \\"International Year of Light\\" award for his images of Shanghai at night and is currently a shortlisted finalist for the 2016 British Professional Photography Awards.  Photographic style  Notably angered in 2015 by the increasing levels of post-processing that was becoming acceptable in the photographic world, Reiffer began a campaign to educate customers and viewers in the difference between \\"taking it\\" and \\"faking it\\" - starting with his review of \\"how far is too far?\\" when it came to many photographers using computer-aided tools to enhance their images beyond reality. Reiffer is a supporter of \\"getting it right in-camera\\" and through his use of behind-the-scenes iPhone and GoPro images captioned \\"What I See Right Now\\", attempts to demonstrate that his images, while corrected for minor issues using software, are indeed accurate representations of the scene he captured with his camera at the time. He often provides information on how an image was captured, with details on filters used and camera settings.  Partnerships  Reiffer is a National Geographic contributor, with his work from New Zealand featuring in their 2016 Hardback book \\"Greatest Landscapes\\". He maintains active partnerships with photographic industry manufacturers such as Rollei and SanDisk, along with being one of a handful of officially recognised Phase One Ambassadors worldwide. In August 2018, Reiffer produced the launch images for the Phase One IQ4 Series of Medium Format Cameras, using their latest 151 Megapixel digital back.  Workshops and Tuition  Across a range of worldwide locations, Reiffer is known in the photography community for providing hands-on workshop education to all levels of student. His collaboration with Danish camera manufacturer Phase One took that one step further in 2015 when he was able to start offering workshops using the latest medium format cameras for all attendees to use \\\\- including the XF100MP, the world's highest resolution medium format digital camera.  Maldives Gallery - pr@hf  In January 2016, Reiffer launched his first gallery in the Maldives - pr@hf \\\\- on PER AQUUM Huvafen Fushi.

It represented one of the earliest methods for constructing tangents to curves. The method hinges on the observation that the radius of a circle is always normal to the circle itself. With this in mind Descartes would construct a circle that was tangent to a given curve. He could then use the radius at the point of intersection to find the slope of a normal line, and from this one can easily find the slope of a tangent line. This was discovered about the same time as Fermat's method of adequality. While Fermat's method had more in common with the infinitesimal techniques that were to be used later, Descartes' method was more influential in the early history of calculus. One reason Descartes' method fell from favor was the algebraic complexity it involved. On the other hand this method can be used to rigorously define the derivative for a wide class of functions using neither infinitesimal nor limit techniques. It is also related to a completely general definition of differentiability given by Carath√©odory .

Giuca's conviction was unanimously overturned in 2018 on grounds that lead prosecutor Anna-Sigga Nicolazzi had withheld favorable evidence from the defense. However, the New York Court of Appeals reinstated Giuca's conviction in June 2019. Background At the time of his arrest, Giuca was living in a three-story family home in Prospect Park South, Brooklyn, while studying criminal justice at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, and occasionally working as a film and TV extra.Backstage: More on John Giuca's Case, Anderson Live website, November 6, 2012 On October 11, 2003, Giuca was out partying with friends in Manhattan. Mark Fisher, unknown to Giuca, ended up in the group's company after meeting a fellow student, Angel DiPietro, at an Upper East Side bar and following DiPietro and a girlfriend to Giuca's for an impromptu party. Also in attendance were Albert Cleary and Antonio Russo, neighborhood friends of Giuca. Police responded to reports of gunfire at 6:30 a.m. and found Fisher's dead body on Argyle Road, just 50 feet away from Cleary's bedroom window and three blocks away from Giuca's house. Fisher had been shot five times. Russo, who had been in trouble with the law previously, cut his hair that morning and left for California. A year later, Russo and Giuca would both be charged with murder and stand trial as co-defendants with separate juries. At trial, the prosecution alleged that Giuca was the leader of a gang and Fisher's murder was ordered by Giuca for \\"street cred\\". Giuca's supporters say he was simply a young man with friends from a variety of backgrounds. Investigation  According to Giuca, he last saw Fisher sitting on Giuca's sofa draped in a blanket. Giuca said he had fallen asleep after the party ended and had no knowledge of the murder. Giuca's house was searched and he was repeatedly stopped and frisked. According to author and former NYPD detective Robert Mladinich, Albert Cleary became a prime suspect as he was involved in a beating in the Bronx and that case was still active. Fisher's family was unhappy with how their son's murder was being investigated and felt that some officials were eager to have the case forgotten. Under pressure to get results in the high-profile case, police announced witnesses were being uncooperative. Media attention leading up to the 2005 Democratic primary for District Attorney frequently highlighted the investigation into Fisher's death, and much of the coverage was critical of the District Attorney's office for failing to apprehend the killers. In February 2004, D.A. Charles Hynes convened an ‚Äúelite‚Äù task force led by Michael Vecchione and Anna Sigga- Nicolazzi. After a year of little progress in the case, witnesses began to come forward, implicating Russo and Giuca. Russo was arrested on November 19, 2004, and Giuca was arrested on December 21, 2004. Map detailing the location of Mark Fisher's body in relation to John Giuca's and Albert Cleary's homes. 2004 Criminal trial =Prosecution arguments= In her opening argument in Giuca's trial, lead prosecutor Nicolazzi offered a theory explaining the murder that she hoped to substantiate with testimony by Giuca's former girlfriend and by his best friend. She claimed Giuca's fantasies about being a crime boss had led him to form a gang known as the \\"Ghetto Mafia\\" and to orchestrate Fisher's murder. The prosecution accused Giuca of giving Russo a gun, bringing Fisher to Russo and participating in beating Fisher. Prosecution evidence included the witnesses‚Äô hearsay accounts of what Russo had said about his own involvement and of Giuca's role in the murder. Cleary, an original suspect now turned state's witness, testified that, hours after the body was discovered, Giuca said, \\"we may have had something to do with that.\\" Cleary said that Giuca mentioned that he had led Fisher out the house to where Russo was waiting with a gun to rob Fisher, but when Fisher put up a fight, Russo had shot him dead. Cleary also offered that, in the weeks before the murder, Giuca spoke about having the gang kill someone, and had shown him a Ruger .22 pistol at his house. After witnesses offered conflicting accounts, Nicolazzi produced her final witness, junkie John Avitto, who claimed that while imprisoned at Rikers Island he had overheard Giuca confess to the murder, but with a completely different account of the events. =Defense arguments= Giuca pled not guilty to the crime. Defense attorney Sam Gregory told the court that if Russo had committed the murder, it was without Giuca's knowledge, participation or approval, and that prosecution witnesses had given untruthful and contradictory testimony. Gregory said that Cleary had given evidence before a grand jury while failing to mention that, prior to the murder, Giuca had allegedly become angry when Fisher sat on a table in Giuca's house. The defense also asserted that Cleary, who had been convicted of an unrelated assault, considered himself to be a \\"tough guy,\\" and implied that Cleary could have told Russo where to find the gun that was used to kill Fisher. Giuca's defense attorney explained to the court that Giuca had not aided Russo, but that under pressure to get results in the case, prosecutors had coerced Cleary's and Giuca's ex-girlfriend, Lauren Calciano, to give false testimony about Giuca having confessed to involvement in the murder. Gregory also dismissed Avitto's testimony as a complete fabrication aimed at winning leniency from the authorities.Teen Slain For Booze, Jury Told, NY Daily News, September 23, 2005 =Verdict and sentencing= Giuca and Russo were tried together, but with two separate juries. The felony murder rule allows a person to be held responsible for a murder committed in the course of a felony or by being complicit to the felony, regardless of intent. After three hours of deliberation, a jury found Giuca guilty on charges of second-degree murder, robbery and multiple counts of criminal possession of a firearm. Russo's jury took two days to find him guilty. In October 2005, Giuca and Russo were each given a sentence of 25 years to life.  Free John Giuca  After Giuca's sentencing, a group wearing T-shirts bearing the slogan \\"Free John Giuca\\" distributed pamphlets outside the courthouse. In the pamphlets, the group claimed that only a small portion of the 150 people who had been subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury had been called to testify in the trial, and that Giuca had not led a gang. According to Giuca's supporters, injuries to Fisher's body indicating a left-handed assailant, the location of Fisher's body and details of 911 calls alerting the police all implicate a crucial prosecution witness in the murder of Fisher.DD-5 police report, Interview of Albert Cleary, Case No. 3106, Complaint No. 70919 - 10/14/2003 and 11/16/2003 Russo and Giuca were brought to trial six weeks before the primary election in which Hynes won a hotly contested nomination battle. Giuca's supporters also pointed to a case in which courts determined prosecutorial misconduct by Hynes' office.  \\"Mother Justice\\"  Giuca's mother, Doreen Giuliano, has led a fight to free her son that has attracted widespread attention from media outlets in the United States and abroad, including Nightline, On the Case with Paula Zahn, The Early Show, Anderson Live, Vanity Fair, The New York Times, The Guardian and the Sydney Morning Herald. She has also been featured in online media including The Huffington Post and the Gothamist. Giuliano's crusade has earned her the nickname \\"Mother Justice\\". Allegations of misconduct Guica's supporters have adduced police statements, prosecution arguments and what they believe to be multiple inconsistencies in witness testimony. They claim that the prosecution brought a contradictory case by arguing for multiple mutually exclusive motives and outcomes, such as asserting that Giuca had pulled the trigger while also accusing Giuca of having ordered the killing to occur while he was not at the scene. = Charles Hynes = Allegations of prosecutorial misconduct by former District Attorney Charles Hynes have been raised in several cases similar to Giuca's. Those recently winning appeals in such cases include Anthony Yarbough, Jonathan Fleming, Darryl Austin, Robert Hill, Alvena Jennette, David Ranta, William Lopez, Ronald Bozeman, Darrell Dula, Jabbar Collins and Jeffrey Deskovic. Hynes has since become notorious for wrongful convictions and politically motivated prosecutions. = Jason Allo = Looking for evidence that could win her son a new trial, Giuliano investigated members of the jury. After somehow obtaining jurors' home addresses, which are not officially available to the defendant, Giuliano targeted juror Jason Allo, whom a friend of Giuca's had recognized in the courtroom. Using the alias Dee Quinn, Giuliano rented an apartment close to Allo's residence, transformed her appearance and established a close relationship with him. Giuliano secretly recorded her conversations with Allo. After nearly a year, she had collected audio of Allo allegedly talking of his biased and antisemitic attitudes toward Giuca (mistakenly believing Giuca to be Jewish) and connections to the case that should have disqualified him from serving on the jury. However, State Supreme Court Justice Alan D. Marrus dismissed the recordings, ruling that they were unreliable, and condemned Giuliano's surreptitious activities as \\"reckless\\". Giuliano then began to investigate those who had testified against her son, starting with John Avitto, Giuca's former cellmate who had testified under oath that Giuca had told him he had committed the murder. While digging through files, Giuliano found that prosecutor Anna-Sigga Nicolazzi had met with Avitto before he gave his testimony and had struck a deal with Avitto to free him of his pending drug charges in return for favorable testimony in court. Avitto has since recanted his testimony.  Recantations  Two of the four prosecution witnesses were former suspects in the case. Three of the four witnesses have recanted, two of whom have alleged that they were intimidated and threatened in order to coerce their testimony. The third witness who recanted has admitted that he received a deal from prosecutors for help resolving his own case, providing incentive for him to lie. = John Avitto = On July 8, 2013, John Avitto recanted his testimony and testified in 2015, apologizing in open court to Giuca. = Lauren Calciano = In 2014, Giuca's ex-girlfriend, Lauren Calciano, officially recanted her testimony. She had originally testified that Giuca had told her that he had given Russo the gun to rob Mark Fisher. In recanting, Calciano asserted that she was pressured by prosecutors to incriminate Giuca. = Anthony Beharry = Anthony Beharry testified that a day or two after the murder (though he could not remember which day exactly), he and Giuca phoned each other back and forth, during which time Beharry nervously took the gun, put it in the trunk of his car and left it under a box on the street for someone else to pick up. He later recanted, indicating that he had not seen Giuca for approximately a week after the murder and that he was pressured to implicate himself and Giuca. Appeals Using Giuliano's Jason Allo recordings, a legal brief was filed by Giuca's attorney Lloyd Epstein, arguing that Giuca did not receive a fair trial because Allo had failed to disclose his connection with and knowledge of people in the case. Giuca's lawyers said that \\"Allo's failure to disclose his personal knowledge of Giuca disqualified him as a juror regardless of whether he acquired this knowledge before or during the trial, or both.\\" The Appellant Division 2nd Department denied the request for a hearing to review evidence of juror misconduct against Allo. Through his attorney, Allo has said the allegations made about him are not true. In November 2010, a panel of four judges ruled that even if alleged statements the former juror had made to Giuliano were true, there were no grounds for overturning Giuca's conviction. On May 14, 2013, federal judge Frederic Block denied Giuca's federal habeas petition. In February 2014, an attorney acting for Giuca submitted a petition to Hynes' replacement as Brooklyn district attorney, Kenneth P. Thompson, requesting that the conviction be voided. In the petition, it was alleged there had been prosecutorial misconduct, a failure by the defense lawyer at trial to point out multiple inconsistencies in the prosecution's case and recantation of testimony by key prosecution witnesses. On June 9, 2016, Giuca was again denied in his appeal for a new trial. \\"I have denied the defendant's motion to vacate the judgment,\\" Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Danny Chun announced in court. The judge also ruled that Giuca had received a fair trial. Mark Bederow, Giuca's attorney, confirmed that he would appeal the verdict, saying \\"His rights were violated. I have no doubt that when it gets up on appeal, [the case] will be vacated.\\" 2018 conviction reversal  On February 7, 2018, a state appellate court in Brooklyn reviewing Nicolazzi's case against Giuca unanimously overturned the conviction and sent it back to the Brooklyn district attorney's office.  Aftermath of conviction reversal  = Russo's confession = On March 22, 2018, Antonio Russo confessed to killing Mark Fisher. In a statement that was passed along to Giuca's lawyer, Russo told detectives that he had committed the murder after leaving Giuca's home with Fisher, also stating that the gun was Russo's. = Subsequent bail hearings = On February 20, June 28 and September 6, 2018, Giuca was denied bail despite having his conviction overturned. = New York Court of Appeals = On June 28, 2018, in a letter to the Brooklyn district attorney, New York's highest court announced it would hear Giuca's case, with oral arguments scheduled for April 30, 2019. =Amicus curiae= In the months leading up to the April 30th oral arguments, a large number of amicus curiae briefs were written in support of Giuca, from parties including the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Innocence Project, American Civil Liberties Union, New York Civil Liberties Union, New York State Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Legal Aid Society, Bronx Defenders, Center for Appellate Litigation, Office of the Appellate Defender and Chief Defenders Association of New York. = Oral arguments, April 2019 = The appeals court heard arguments on April 30, 2019 to determine whether Giuca should be granted a new trial. Mark Bederow, a former prosecutor turned criminal defense attorney, represented Giuca. He filed a brief arguing that the prosecution's key witness in the murder trial, John Avitto, had only testified to avoid incarceration for violating the terms of a drug-treatment program. This information had not been given to the defense at trial and Giuca argued that such a disclosure could have changed the outcome of the trial. Giuca's defense claimed evidence shows that prosecutors were in contact with officials from Avitto's drug treatment program to monitor his status. Prosecutors denied any arrangement with Avitto. = June 2019 decision = On June 11, 2019 the New York Court of Appeals ruled that, even if prosecutors had failed to disclose material that may have helped Giuca's defense, the outcome of the trial likely would have been the same. Chief Judge Janet DiFiore, writing for the majority of the court, wrote: \\"We hold that, to the extent there was any suppression of impeachment material, there is no reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been different if the information at issue had been disclosed.‚Äù Associate Judge Jenny Rivera wrote in a dissenting opinion that prosecutors had an obligation to provide the defense with information that may have supported arguments against Avitto's testimony. Associate Judges Leslie Stein, Michael J. Garcia, Rowan D. Wilson and Paul Feinman signed the majority opinion with DiFiore. Associate Judge Eugene Fahey took no part in the case. = August 2019 Appeal = On August 6, 2019, the Guica legal team filed a CPL 440.10 motion to vacate his conviction based on a taped interview where jailhouse informant John Ingram tells prosecutor Nicolazzi that Russo had confessed to him that he had killed Fisher alone, with his own gun. The tape was only handed over to the defense team by current ADA Melissa Carvajal, on June 4, 2018. In this newly filed motion, Bederow argues that Ingram‚Äôs interview is exculpatory for Giuca and by law should have been turned over to his lawyer before trial‚Äî13 years ago. The state responded to the motion on November 26, indicating that the lead Prosecutor could not recall whether she had handed over the tape. Nonetheless, they affirm that there is ‚Äúno reasonable possibility‚Äù that the Ingram recording would have led jurors to acquitting Guica. Guica responded this on January 31 outlining that had the jury known that (a) Russo admitted robbing and murdering Mark Fisher by himself and that Giuca refused to get rid of the murder weapon for him and (b) Nicolazzl's previous suppression of evidence of key witness John Avitto's motive to lie, (as per Justice Jenny Rivera's dissent on June 11, 2019, in People v. John Giuca, 33 NY3d 462, 483 (2019)), it is reasonably possible that the cumulative impact of this evidence, would have led to a different outcome at trial. = December 2020 Evidentiary Hearing = On August 18, 2020, Brooklyn Judge Danny Chun ruled that tape handed over to John's lawyer 13 years later, which exculpates Giuca, necessitates a new hearing. Over a Skype call, Chun ordered a hearing \\"to determine whether or not the people either suppressed, or failed, or did not turn over the tape in question ‚Äù. The tape contains an Interview with Joseph Ingram (now deceased) and Lead Prosecutor Anna-Sigga Nicolazzi, in her office, where he recounts Russo‚Äôs telling in which the other kid, John Giuca, had no role in the crime. The Brooklyn's DA office refutes that the people suppressed or failed to turn over the tape in question.

He was born at Hampstead, London. Biography Educated at Sherborne School, Earls-Davis went up to Cambridge University but, like many students of his time, then joined the armed forces during World War II. He was an officer in the Irish Guards and was wounded in action in 1944. He was thus 26 by the time he started his first-class cricket career as a lower-order left-handed batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler at Cambridge in 1947. In his first game, against Worcestershire, he took five wickets in the match, including Don Kenyon twice. In the following match against Gloucestershire, he took four wickets for 87 in the county's first innings, and these proved to be the best bowling figures of his career. But he did not maintain this form and dropped out of the team before the University Match, and therefore did not win a Blue. In wartime non-first-class matches, Earls-Davis had played for Sussex and he appeared in a second eleven match in 1947, scoring 58 as a middle-order batsman. But by 1949 he was playing non-first-class matches for Somerset and in 1950, when the Somerset captaincy was a matter for discussion following the resignation of the 1949 captain, George Woodhouse, Earls-Davis was one of several amateurs mentioned as potentially available. In the event, he played only once, making four runs and bowling five wicket-less overs on a spinners' wicket at Worcester. Outside cricket Earls-Davis returned to Sherborne School as a teacher. He married in 1958 and had two sons and a daughter. He died on 5 April 2016.

It is the last section of the ape vertebral column. Most commonly in humans it comprises 3 to 5 fused (or, more rarely, separate) vertebrae, and is approximately 4 to 10 cm in length. The coccyx is attached to the sacrum by a fibrocartilaginous joint, called the sacrococcygeal symphysis, allowing for some (but little) movement. Anatomical diagram of a healthy coccyx Causes Causes of coccyx fracture can vary greatly, but are most commonly confined to falls into the seated position, or childbirth. Risk factors The following risk factors have been identified for coccyx fracture: * Lack of/reduced muscle mass * Advanced age * Osteoporosis * Being of the female sex (due to the wider pelvis typically found in females) * Violence Symptoms of coccyx fracture include: * Pain that increases in severity when sitting or getting up from a chair, or when experiencing bowel movement * Provoked pain over the tailbone * Nausea * Bruising or swelling in the tailbone area Diagnosis The standard workup of a suspected coccyx fracture includes medical history and a physical examination including a rectal examination. X-ray has no quantifiable clinical impact, and is regarded as a waste of resources and unnecessary exposure to ionizing radiation. Treatment If the coccyx fracture is severe enough, short-term hospitalisation may be required, although this is extremely rare. More often, self-care at home is administered. Sitting on soft surfaces is recommended, as this reduces pressure on the coccyx. A 'donut' or 'wedge' cushion may be purchased ‚Äì these are simply cushions with a hole in them to ensure that no weight is placed in the injured tailbone. Painkillers such as ibuprofen are also recommended, as is a diet high in fibre to soften stools and avoid constipation. Doctors will not usually attempt to correct a bad alignment, as muscles in the area are powerful and can pull the bone back into the 'bad' position. The bone is also very difficult to immobilise simply due to the sheer number of muscles attached to it, as well as the position. =Surgery= Following a coccyx fracture, surgery is not usually required. However, if the pain continues even after the fracture has healed, and is severe enough to cause serious disability, surgical removal of the coccyx (coccygectomy) may be required.

Engines with Renumbering Lists, issued by the Chief Mechanical Engineer‚Äôs Office, Pretoria, January 1912, pp. 7, 12, 15, 35 (Reprinted in April 1987 by SATS Museum, R.3125-6/9/11-1000) Manufacturer In 1904, orders were placed with the North British Locomotive Company (NBL) for two Pacific type locomotives for the Natal Government Railways (NGR). They were designed by NGR Locomotive Superintendent D.A. Hendrie for passenger traffic on those sections of the mainline between Ladysmith and Charlestown which did not have very severe gradients. When they were delivered and placed in service early in 1905, they were designated the NGR Class A, also commonly known as the Hendrie A, and numbered 325 and 326.North British Locomotive Company works list, compiled by Austrian locomotive historian Bernhard Schmeiser Characteristics The boiler of this Class was noted for its free steaming qualities. The engines used saturated steam, had Stephenson valve gear and were built on plate frames. The cylinders were inclined 1 in 18 and were arranged outside the plate frames, while the balanced slide valves were arranged inside the frames. After these two engines, Hendrie adopted Walschaerts valve gear and outside valves on all his subsequent locomotive designs for its greater accessibility. D.A. Hendrie The locomotives had Belpaire fireboxes with firebar rocking finger grates. To accommodate the wide and deep firebox, Hendrie made use of a bridle casting along the same lines as the one which was first introduced by H.M. Beatty on his Cape Government Railways (CGR) 6th Class of 1903, later the on the South African Railways (SAR). With a bridle casting, the widening of the locomotive frame at the back end was accomplished by uniting the narrow front part of the frame and the wider rear part by the heavy steel casting. This method of widening the frames for the firebox continued on the SAR until the general adoption of bar frames for mainline locomotives by 1927 rendered it no longer necessary. Service =Natal Government Railways= The two locomotives ran their first trials on 31 January and 3 March 1905 respectively. As intended, they were placed in service between Ladysmith and Charlestown and were shedded at Charlestown. They worked the mail trains on this section for many years. =South African Railways= When the Union of South Africa was established on 31 May 1910, the three Colonial government railways (CGR, NGR and Central South African Railways) were united under a single administration to control and administer the railways, ports and harbours of the Union. Although the South African Railways and Harbours came into existence in 1910, the actual classification and renumbering of all the rolling stock of the three constituent railways were only implemented with effect from 1 January 1912.The South African Railways - Historical Survey. Editor George Hart, Publisher Bill Hart, Sponsored by Dorbyl Ltd., Published c. 1978, p. 25. In 1912, these two Pacifics were renumbered 762 and 763 and designated on the SAR. They were later transferred to the Witwatersrand for a short period, after which they worked on the Komatipoort-Waterval Boven section until they were withdrawn by 1936.

The name is derived from Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden (1714‚Äì1794); an attempt to connect the name to Saint Kevin (Old Irish C√≥emgen) is regarded as spurious. A prominent company located on Upper Camden St for over a century was Earley and Company (1861‚Äì1975). They were ecclesiastical furnishings and stained glass manufacturers and retailers. The firm was one of the largest and most prestigious ecclesiastical decorators both in Ireland and the U.K. There were two cinemas on the street: The Camden Cinema and the Theatre De Luxe. The Camden Cinema was located at 55 Upper Camden St., where the headquarters of Concern Worldwide is now located. It closed around 1912. The Theatre De Luxe was opened in 1912 by Maurice Elliman, a Jew who escaped the pogroms in Eastern Europe. The first building was designed by Frederick Hayes, MRIAI, and built by George Squire & Co. It was enlarged and rebuilt in 1920.Irish Times, 4 September 1920 The exterior was remodelled in Art deco style in 1934. It closed in 1975.

He was born at Sydney, Australia and died following a ski-ing accident at Davos, Switzerland. Background and education The son of an Australian doctor who took his medical degree at Oxford University and then settled at East Grinstead, Sussex, Frazer was educated at Winchester College where he was an all-round sportsman. As a cricketer he was a left- handed middle-order or opening batsman and a left-arm fast-medium bowler; however, his bowling \\"mysteriously deserted him ‚Äì possibly a result of gymnastics\\", according to his obituary, written by his Winchester contemporary Douglas Jardine in the 1928 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, and he did not bowl in first-class cricket. Cricket and soccer at Oxford Frazer won an exhibition scholarship to read natural sciences at Balliol College, Oxford; he stayed at Oxford for four years from 1920 to 1924, completing his degree in three years and gaining a first-class honours, and then staying on to do chemistry research for a further year. His sporting record at Oxford was patchy. He played in the two non-first-class trial matches at the start of the 1921 season, but was not selected for the first-class team, instead making his first-class debut against the university side for Somerset: this was not an unusual arrangement for Somerset's matches with the universities in the first third of the 20th century, giving the county the chance to try new players (and also filling gaps in its largely amateur team) and allowing the university cricket club the opportunity to see potential players of its own. In the single match that Frazer played for Somerset, scoring 4 and 14, a second Oxford freshman (and chemist), Guy Blaikie, also played for the county side; unlike Frazer, Blaikie returned to Somerset for further matches in subsequent seasons. Frazer did not play for Oxford that summer or the next, instead turning out for Sussex, for whom he was qualified by residence, in a couple of County Championship matches in 1921, and a further five games in 1922. He had no great success in these matches, with a highest score of just 40, made in the match against Warwickshire at Hove in 1922. In 1923, he captained one of the teams of \\"seniors\\" in a trial match and saved the game for his side by making an unbeaten 81 in the second innings: \\"his driving was powerful and his hitting on the leg side was very clean,\\" said Wisden in its report in the 1924 Almanack. However, he again failed to appear in any first- class games for the university first team and he once more played in a single match against the university cricket team, this time for Free Foresters in a first-class match in June; he then appeared in nine Sussex matches at the end of the university term, raising his personal highest score marginally to 43 in the game against Gloucestershire at Bristol. In September 1923, before starting his postgraduate year, Frazer was a member of a Free Foresters side that toured Canada, playing seven two-day matches. While Frazer did not play first-class cricket during his undergraduate time at Oxford, he did play for the university's soccer team, winning a blue in the 1922/23 match against Cambridge at outside-left. He won a second blue in his postgraduate year when, in the report in The Times, he was \\"the most dangerous forward on the Oxford side\\". In 1924, as a postgraduate student with more time, Frazer finally played first-class cricket for Oxford University. He played in most of the team matches in the 1924 season, batting mainly in the middle order, but his best score and his only total ever of more than 50 was made as an opening batsman, with 81 in the match against H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's XI at Eastbourne, a rather weak team composed entirely of amateurs, many of them not in the first flush of youth (Ernest Smith, the captain, was 54 and had played for Oxford University 36 years earlier in 1888). Frazer's timing for a big innings was immaculate: the next Oxford game was the University Match and he duly won a cricket blue to go with his two soccer blues, scoring 5 and 20 in his two innings in a nine-wicket defeat by Cambridge. Frazer played seven further matches for Sussex when the university term was over, without success, and appeared for two amateur teams in first-class matches against Oxford University in 1925, but that was the end of his first-class cricket career. After university According to his obituary in The Times, Frazer was awarded a first-class degree in 1924 and then stayed for a further year at Oxford to act as a chemistry \\"demonstrator\\" at Balliol. He then left to pursue a career in business in London. His death in a ski-ing accident appears to have been widely mourned. The Times obituary says: \\"Frazer was undoubtedly one of the most brilliant all-round men of his generation and all who knew him felt he would have gone far.\\" It adds that \\"it is significant that when his death became known at Davos, the championship ski contest was suspended, although he was not himself a competitor\\". A response to the original obituary, published 12 days later, talked of his work in physical education with young people in a deprived part of the East End of London; it ends with fulsome praise: \\"If Jack Frazer was typical and representative of the rising generation, we need not despair of England yet.\\" His younger brother, Charles, played a few first-class cricket matches for Oxford University in 1927 and 1928.

The accident Liu Wei lost his arms at the age of 10 after touching a high-voltage wire during a game of hide-and-seek.Subtitles of his video profile (YouTube) He regained consciousness after 45 days of critical condition. His parents told him he should learn how to eat by himself, otherwise no one could take care of him when they become old. His mother kept telling him that he is not different from the others. In the hospital, he met an armless painter, which inspired him to learn to use his feet to write, brush his teeth and eat. At the time, he dreamed of becoming a soccer player. He was encouraged by Liu Jingshen, vice-chairman of the Beijing Disabled Persons' Federation, to do daily chores with his feet and started swimming two years later. He won two gold medals and one silver at the National Swimming Championship for the Disabled in 2002. He learned how to do other daily activities such as navigating online, eating, dressing and brushing his teeth. He considers himself more fortunate than those without enough to eat, debunking ideas of those who believe him unhappy. Becoming a musician He started playing the piano at age of 18 or 19 (sources vary) to pursue his childhood dream of being a musician. His first teacher quit as he considered it impossible for someone to play with their toes. However, Liu, who was studying music theory, persisted and taught himself in secret how to play, despite cramps and abrasion,Armless Pianist Liu Wei: \\"You either die or live life splendidly\\" (My Motivational Diary) often practicing seven hours a day. As he said, the melodies he can play are limited due to the length of his toes and he cannot play certain pieces he loves because he cannot reach across octaves. Nevertheless, he aims to become such a good pianist that people won't notice that his arms are missing. Appearance in the talent show In his first appearance, Liu received a standing ovation from the audience, many of whom were moved to tears, for a performance of \\"Mariage D'amour\\" by Richard Clayderman on August 8, 2010. The semifinal took place on September 12, and he played \\"You're Beautiful\\" in Shanghai Stadium at the final on October 10, accompanied by his singing. The jury panel of China's Got Talent, Shanghai stand-up comedian Zhou Libo, Taiwan singer-actress Annie Yi and mainland pop composer Gao Xiaosong, all praised Liu's performance. As a prize for his achievement, Liu was invited by Taiwanese singer Jolin Tsai to be a guest act on her Myself World Tour in Shanghai, which would give him the chance to perform in Las Vegas for three months. In addition, he was likely to get a contract with Fremantle Media and Sony Music Entertainment, and his itinerary was to include Hong Kong, Paris, Vienna and Taipei. In 2010, he won the Guinness World Record of typing the most letters alphabetically in 1 minute, using the feet: 251 letters.

It is also known as The Temple or The Cumberland Temple, in celebration of the victorious Duke of Cumberland's army over the forces of the pretender Prince Charles Edward Stuart at the battle of Culloden in 1746. The tower was most probably designed by Daniel Garrett and comprises four storeys and a roof terrace linked by a small spiral staircase. The estate, comprising Yorke House, was demolished in 1823, and the remaining buildings and parklands, including the tower, became part of Temple View. The isolated position of the tower meant that it was used less and less, and was increasingly subject to vandalism and theft.

He was a leading figure in Johnny Adair's C Company, one of the most active sections of the UDA, before later falling out with Adair and serving as West Belfast brigadier. Early years Courtney was born in Belfast in July 1963.David Lister & Hugh Jordan, Mad Dog: The Rise and Fall of Johnny Adair and 'C' Company, Mainstream, 2004, p. 56 In the late 1970s and early 1980s Courtney was part in a gang of teenagers from Belfast's Shankill Road and nearby districts who spent their days near the Buffs Club on Century Street in the nearby Oldpark district. This gang included Johnny \\"Mad Dog\\" Adair with whom Courtney formed a friendship.Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, pp. 29‚Äì30 The gang as a group had joined C8, one of around eighteen teams of 30 to 60 men that made up C Company of the 2nd Battalion of the Ulster Freedom Fighters, over a period of several months in 1984.Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, pp. 47‚Äì48 Courtney and Adair became closer as the 1980s went on and on 23 November 1985 they attended the \\"Ulster Says No\\" rally against the Anglo-Irish Agreement at Belfast City Hall together.Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, p. 51 According to Courtney the signing of the Agreement saw a surge of recruits to the UDA in general and C Company in particular, leading to an upswing in violent activity.Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, p. 55 Courtney had a reputation as something of a petty thief and even suffered a punishment beating from more senior members of the UDA for a spate of burglaries on the Shankill. However Courtney was taken away from these habits by William \\"Winkie\\" Dodds, an old family friend of the Courtneys who was five years older than Mo. Initially recruiting just Courtney, before also adding Adair and others from Oldpark, Dodds trained the youngsters in weapons use to prepare them for active service. UDA activity Courtney was soon sent out as a gunman and was allegedly active in killing by around 1987.Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, p. 59 During the 1980s he headed an Active Service Unit (ASU) of the UDA in West Belfast.Peter Taylor, Loyalists, Bloomsbury, 2000, p. 204 He was questioned in regards to the 1989 murder of Pat Finucane in 2002.Henry McDonald & Jim Cusack, UDA ‚Äì Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terrorr, Penguin Ireland, 2004, p. 377 During the late 1980s, Courtney was part of a movement within the UDA that became frustrated with the directions being taken by the UDA leadership. He argued that too little was being done by the movement in terms of killing republicans as the leaders were too happy to sit back and become rich from extortion and racketeering. Courtney was soon involved in conspiracies to overthrow the UDA leadership.Taylor, Loyalists, pp. 204‚Äì205 These however came to nothing as the fallout from the Stevens Inquiries saw the existing leadership swept aside. For his part, Courtney would go on to become part of the new leadership that emerged in the 1990s around Johnny Adair. Courtney was jailed in 1991 for robbery, theft and hijacking, and soon became a leading figure within the Maze prison. Along with Adair and Michael Stone, he met Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) politician and then Lord Mayor of Belfast, Rev Eric Smyth in the prison to discuss the possibility of a future prisoner release scheme.Adair's lieutenant shifts sides to UDA He gained a reputation as a fearsome fighter and took a leading role in the battles with the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) during the internecine loyalist feud between Adair's men and the UVF in 2000. On 19 August 2000 when the feud broke out fully during the \\"loyalist day of culture\\" held on the Shankill Road, Courtney was identified as one of three UDA gunmen who shot at UVF members who had barricaded themselves in the \\"Rex Bar\\". Three people were injured in the gun attack with others wounded from a series of physical attacks by C Company members.Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, pp. 289‚Äì290 Adair was returned to prison as the feud escalated and there he became close to the Shoukri brothers, leading figures in the North Belfast UDA. Courtney, along with other Adair cohorts such as Gary \\"Smickers\\" Smyth, teamed up the Shoukris whilst Adair was imprisoned and ran a lucrative drug dealing operation together.Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, p. 309 In the 1990s he was the subject on an interview by British journalist Peter Taylor for his televised documentary and book Loyalists. During the interview he recounted his time as a gunman in the late 1980s when he was \\"on the go seven days a week\\" and \\"couldn't even afford a pint\\". Return to UDA mainstream In late 2002 when Adair and his ally John White were expelled from the UDA Courtney remained loyal to \\"Mad Dog\\" and was the main guard at Adair's Shankill Road house, known colloquially as the \\"Big Brother House\\" after the setting of the then popular TV series.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 378 However Adair had grown suspicious of the new relationship between Courtney and the Shoukris, whom Adair had come to see as rivals, and, believing that they were plotting against him, sent a hit team to kill Courtney. He managed to avoid the attack after being warned about it by his C Company colleague Donald Hodgen.Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, p. 329 Following the killing of popular UDA man John Gregg, the leadership of the UDA under Jackie McDonald offered members of the UDA loyal to Adair the chance to defect back to the mainstream UDA whilst putting the word around that they intended to launch an all-out assault on Adair's Boundary Way stronghold on the lower Shankill. Realising that Adair's time was up, Courtney prepared to defect by visiting the mother of Johnny Adair's wife Gina Crossan and threatening her unless she told him the whereabouts of Adair's arms cache. Although Adair's mother-in-law was unable to give him the information he sought, Courtney was able to take weapons and money from a nearby C Company arms dump. He subsequently took these to the \\"Heather Social Club\\", the headquarters of those on the Shankill loyal to the mainstream UDA, where he affirmed his split from Adair and his new loyalty to McDonald.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 384 Courtney denounced Adair as a \\"treacherous bastard\\" for the attempted hit against him.Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, p. 328 Adair's supporters fled the Shankill a few days later (with Adair himself back in prison), and in a public show of loyalty to the new UDA regime, Courtney was filmed by television cameras defacing a mural Adair had ordered painted extolling the friendship between the UDA and the Loyalist Volunteer Force. This was part of a wider removal of murals, posters and graffiti in support of Adair and C Company.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 388 Alan McCullough Courtney regained his influence within the UDA and replaced \\"Fat Jackie\\" Thompson as brigadier of the West Belfast UDA.Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, p. 335 As a result, it was he that Alan McCullough, who had fled to England with Adair, phoned in mid-2003 seeking permission to return to the Shankill having grown tired of life in exile in Bolton. McCullough promised Courtney to tell him the whereabouts of a huge haul of drugs stashed by C Company as well as the address of Gina Adair, whose house McCullough even shot at to prove his loyalty to the new leadership. McCullough was given permission to return although when he did so he was killed by the UDA at Mallusk near Templepatrick in a double cross on 28 May 2003.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 393 McCullough's murder caused widespread revulsion on the lower Shankill mainly on account of the treacherous nature of the killing. This resulted in Courtney, who still feared for his position within the UDA because of his long associations with Adair, going into hiding as he feared a possible retaliation. Courtney, along with Ihab Shoukri, was arrested and charged with the murder of McCullough a few days later.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 394 He had been discovered in Carrickfergus where he had gone into hiding.Finucane suspect charged over UDA feud killing However Courtney was acquitted of the murder in 2006. In a Diplock court trial the judge ruled that there were flaws in the evidence provided by McCullough's family and an anonymous \\"witness A\\".Loyalist cleared on murder charge Following his release, the Court of Appeal passed judgement that his acquittal had been unsound and ordered a retrial. Not long after this, in January 2007, Courtney was the victim of a savage attack on the Shankill Road by an old UVF rival.Mo Attacked At the retrial Courtney was given an eight-year prison sentence after confessing to manslaughter.Top loyalist given eight years from bbc.co.uk His version of events, which was accepted by the court, was that Courtney believed he was to be involved only in a knee-capping of McCullough but that another person present had actually done the killing.Loyalist admits feud manslaughter Following his imprisonment, Barbara McCullough, the deceased's mother, claimed that Courtney had been a police agent and informer.Courtney is a tout: Victim's mother Subsequent activity Courtney has continued to be linked to the Finucane and in 2007, whilst serving his sentence for his involvement in McCullough's death, he was named as one of the two gunmen to kill Finucane in an affidavit filed in a Belfast court by Metropolitan Police officer Detective Chief Inspector Graham Taylor, who was at the time heading the investigation into the killing.Courtney 'killed Finucane' Courtney was released from prison and returned to his home in the Glencairn area to the north of the Shankill. However in 2013 Courtney was convicted of the assault of Tracey Coulter at the offices of the Lower Shankill Community Association. According to court reports Coulter had gone to the offices to speak to Courtney's associates about the death of her cousin, a drug-user, a week earlier. During Coulter's visit she had become embroiled in an argument with an unnamed man when Courtney intervened and head-butted her.Loyalist William 'Mo' Courtney guilty of head-butting woman during drugs confrontationLoyalist William 'Mo' Courtney guilty of head-butting woman Courtney is due to be sentenced in January 2014. Coulter, who is the daughter of Jackie Coulter (a close associate of Adair's who was killed in the 2002 feud with the UVF), had her house burnt down in an arson attack soon after Courtney's conviction. She publicly accused the UDA of being behind the attack.Tracey Coulter says UDA behind 'arson attack' on her Belfast home In December 2013 Courtney was again brought before the courts, to face charges of harassing Coulter in the aftermath of his previous conviction, as well as threatening to kill campaigner Raymond McCord, who was with Courtney during the alleged incident.William 'Mo' Courtney denies threat charges Courtney was given a suspended prison sentence of four months and ordered to pay Coulter ¬£500 for the incident.Loyalist William 'Mo' Courtney gets suspended sentence for headbutt He was subsequently also found guilty of threatening to kill McCord, although a similar charge relating to Coulter was dismissed.William 'Mo' Courtney convicted on threat to kill charge =North Belfast feud= Beginning in 2013 and continuing into the following year, a loyalist feud broke out within the UDA North Belfast Brigade between the supporters of its leader John Bunting and a dissident tendency based in Tigers Bay who sought to oust Bunting and install Robert Molyneaux as a replacement.UDA feud escalates over bid to oust north Belfast 'brigadier' John Bunting From the start Bunting, as well as fellow brigadiers Jackie McDonald and Jimmy Birch, stated that elements within the West Belfast Brigade were closely involved with the dissidents and as a result the West Belfast Brigade split from the rest of the UDA.UDA feud escalates over bid to oust north Belfast 'brigadier' John Bunting Courtney was widely reported as one of the leading figures in the conspiracy and in early 2014 UDA leaders approached Matt Kincaid, offering him the chance to re-integrate the West Belfast Brigade with the wider UDA if he expelled Courtney and Jim Spence. Kincaid rejected the proposal however, opting instead to support Courtney and Spence. In September 2014 it was reported in the Belfast Telegraph that Bunting, McDonald and Birch, as well as the head of the Londonderry and North Antrim Brigade had met to discuss the feud as well as the schism with the West Belfast Brigade. According to the report they agreed that West Belfast Brigade members loyal to the wider UDA should establish a new command structure for the brigade which would then take the lead in ousting the three men they identified as the biggest trouble-makers, namely Courtney, Spence and Eric McKee from their existing leadership positions. It was also stated that the West Belfast breakaway leaders had recruited Jimbo Simpson, a former North Belfast brigadier driven out of Northern Ireland over a decade earlier, and were seeking to restore him to his former role.

It has been designated since January 1950 by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. The present chancel and nave date back to the 13th century. The church stands at the northern end of Ruislip High Street, near the Manor Farm site. History Entrance gate to St Martin's Church A church for Ruislip appears in the 1086 Domesday Book but is believed to have been replaced by the present church in 1245, when an increase in the parish population called for a larger building. Stones with markings from the Norman period have been found in the grounds, believed to be from the original building. While Ruislip was under the ownership of the Bec Abbey, the monks bestowed the name St. Martin upon the church, dedicating it to Saint Martin of Tours from Normandy.Bowlt 2007, p.10 The Proctor-General of the Bec Abbey, William de Guineville, is believed to have insisted upon the rebuilding of the church. He had held the position since 1242 and lived in the priory at Manor Farm. The first recorded vicar of the church was William de Berminton in 1327.Bowlt 1994, p.17 Between 1404 and 1414, the Bec Abbey lost its lands following heavy taxation during the Hundred Years War. By 1422, the condition of the building had deteriorated, at which point it was given to the Dean and Canons of Windsor. They had the chancel built later in the 15th century, while the parishioners themselves rebuilt the south aisle in 1440. The church tower was also built in the 15th century with a set of bells. Thomas Bettz left ¬£26 13 4d in his will in 1463 to pay for the repair of the bells. An extension to the south aisle was added in 1500.Bowlt 2007, p.11 In 1870, the church building was substantially restored by the architect George Gilbert Scott.Newbery et al 1996 In 1958, the rood beam was added as a memorial to the local Gower family. The Ruislip war memorial dedicated to those killed in the First World War was moved from its original position in the church graveyard in 1976, to be near the entrance to Manor Farm.

The park features Albany's only outdoor non-wading swimming pool, along with several tennis courts, basketball courts, and football and baseball fields. Within the park is the James Hall Office, a National Historic Landmark, and the Thomas O'Brien Academy of Science and Technology (TOAST) an elementary school. In 2018 the park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Lincoln Park sits mostly in a large basin or ravine carved by the Beaver Kill, a stream that flowed from the west to the Hudson River. In 1626 the commander of the Dutch Republic's colonial outpost Fort Orange along with a company of six soldiers accompanied their allies, the Mohicans, in their war against the Mohawks. They were ambushed on the site of the future Lincoln Park near Delaware Avenue, during the battle the commander and three of the soldiers died. As the city grew the kill (Dutch for creek) and the land in the area came to be owned by the Dutch Reformed Church. Evert Wendell, perhaps illegally as a squatter, built saw and grist mills and a brewery on that land prior to 1737, using the water power from the kill. These improvements were located near the Lincoln Park swimming pool and where Hawk Street would be if extended through the park. By 1800 the mills were deteriorated and abandoned, and soon after were sold as pasture. Due to the fine natural clay banks along the gorge carved by the Beaver Kill several brickyards came to be established in Lincoln Park during the 19th century, mostly along Morton Avenue between Hawk and Eagle. The Beaver Kill's natural waterfall, west of the intersection of Park Avenue and South Swan Street provided for waterwheel power for local industry. Industry continued to be located around the falls, especially breweries which would dump so much waste product into the Beaver Kill that the falls became known as Buttermilk Falls. What is today the southwestern corner of the park was once owned by James Hall who owned an office built around 1852 and a house around 1880 along Delaware Avenue. The first portion of the park to be opened was a children's playground that was built by the Mother's Club (today the Women's Club of Albany), and this included Hall's land. It was Albany's first park that was more than passive, it was the city's first public playground and was called the Central Playground. Hall's office became the location of indoor children's activities, and the site of his house would later become the site of today's tennis courts. 1878 map of streets and Beaver Creek in future Lincoln Park West of Hawk Street was the location of Martinville, an Irish shanty town from the US Civil War era, named for its builder James Martin. Through Chapter 449 of the Laws of 1890 the Commissioners of Washington Park received authorization to acquire land for Beaver Park, an irregular shaped area corresponding to the majority of present-day Lincoln Park east of Swan Street. Under plans drawn by Charles Downing Lay and Arnold Brunner, published in 1914 as Stvdies for Albany the eastern section of the park was developed. The original plan was more elaborate and grand than what was actually built. But the basic plan for athletic fields, a swimming pool, bathhouse, and children's activities were kept. These developments in the early 20th century included the destruction of Martinville in 1910 and a swimming pool in 1915 was constructed, but was contaminated due to the proximity of the sewer that was the underground Beaver Creek. In 1930 the current swimming pool was constructed in its place. In 1954 Albany Public School 24 (PS 24) was built in the northwestern corner of the park off Delaware Avenue, previously having been in an 1893 building several blocks north. In 1990 the school was renamed the Thomas O'Brien Academy of Science and Technology (TOAST). In 1982 a proposal was made to Mayor Erastus Corning 2nd for a civic center in the eastern section of Lincoln Park. The mayor was receptive to the plan and inquired to the state about use of parking facilities at the Empire State Plaza in conjunction with the civic center. The next year another group of investors proposed to the mayor regarding a civic center in Lincoln Park. The mayor, who would die four months later, responded with \\"Please discuss this with Jim Coyne\\", who was the Albany County executive. Later that year Coyne announced plans for a county-owned civic center facility, and though the Lincoln Park site was proposed at public hearings, the first site chosen was in Latham before finally settling on South Pearl Street in Downtown Albany (today the Times Union Center). In 1989 the prologue to the first Tour de Trump featured a loop through Lincoln Park. In 1993 South Swan Street within the park, from Morton Avenue to Myrtle Avenue, was renamed Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and a statue of King was erected at the corner of said boulevard and Morton Avenue. Martin Luther King III was in attendance at the unveiling as the guest speaker. The statue comprises an tall statue with panels of granite etched with images from throughout his life and of lines of his speeches. The Lincoln Park pool bathhouse was gutted and renovated in 2001 at a cost of $3 million. Festivals Many festivals, concerts, and parties have been held over the years in the park. In 1949 the \\"I am an American\\" Day celebration in Lincoln Park overshadowed the first annual Tulip Fest in Washington Park. Over 25,000 people attended the anti-Communist Cold War event which featured heavy-weight boxing champ Jack Dempsey and two-time-Oscar-winning actor Harold Russell. As part of their farewell tour the Ramones played in Lincoln Park at the University at Albany, SUNY's 1996 Party at the Park. The Northeast Rugby Union's Division II Women's Championship was held in Lincoln Park in 2002. As part of the 300th anniversary of the Dongan Charter incorporating Albany as a city, Lincoln Park was the site of a hot-air balloon launch and a reenactment of a skirmish of US Revolutionary War forces. The annual NYS Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Memorial Observance ends each year with a \\"Beloved Community March\\" that travels from the Empire State Plaza concourse entrance on Madison Avenue to Swan Street (which turns into Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard at the entrance to the park) and ends at the King Monument with the laying of a wreath. Facilities and activities Lincoln Park as seen from the Corning Tower of the Empire State Plaza. The park contains the larger of Albany's two public pools, the Lincoln Park Pool. It covers approximately , is deep in center, and can hold over 300 swimmers at a time. The pool may be the largest cement pool in the Northeastern US. In 1988 the pool was given a half a million dollar renovation after leaking so badly the year before that it was losing a quarter of its water daily. The park also has a wading pool and spray pool. Lincoln Park has multiple tennis courts, basketball courts, handball courts, and playgrounds as well as ball fields. A youth fitness center (ages 7‚Äì19) with a gym, weight room, and activities such as wrestling, karate, dance fitness, and cardio. Since the park's primary purpose is as a public outdoor sports/fitness activity center, the park sees many spontaneous non-traditional activities by the public ranging such as T'ai chi on the tennis courts. Until 2011, two public schools were located within Lincoln Park, though the land they sit on was owned by the City School District of Albany and not by the city as part of the park. They are the Thomas O'Brien Academy of Science and Technology (TOAST) and the Sunshine School. TOAST still operates as a pre-K through 5 elementary magnet school and the Sunshine School was used for transitioning at-risk students in grades 9-12 from places such as jail, prison, juvenile detention centers, New York State Office of Children and Family Services, or drug treatment facilities. In January 2011 The Sunshine School was moved to Watervliet Ave. and the Sunshine School building was offered for sale in 2012. The Sunshine School is located in James Hall's former office. TOAST has an associated Outdoor Learning Center in the park and a Geological Rock Park that opened in 2001. Adjacent to the school's Geological Rock Park are 50 1-2 ton boulders from across the state of New York that are being temporarily stored there until a permanent home can be given to them on the grounds of the New York State Museum, both the state's boulders and the Geological Rock Park are open to the public. Capital District Community Gardens (CDCG) has a community garden with 51 plots located in the park off Eagle Street. For 55 years the American Little League of Albany has sold Christmas trees on the tennis courts in the park as a fund raiser. As of 2015, the park has been a regular training ground for Albany's Gaelic Football club, the James Connolly Albany Rebels.https://www.albanyrebels.com/training- schedule See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Albany, New York References External links * Category:Urban public parks Category:Parks in Albany, New York Category:Parks on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:National Register of Historic Places in Albany, New York Category:Protected areas established in 1900 Category:1900 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Lincoln Park (Albany, New York)"},{"id":"31992557","text":"Tim Harrysson (born February 10, 1992) is a Swedish professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing with Kumla HC of the Hockeyettan (Div.1) He previously played with Link√∂pings HC in the Elitserien during the 2010‚Äì11 Elitserien season.

Martyn was the son of Sir William Martyn and his wife Susan Prestwood, of Exeter. He was educated at Broadgates Hall, Oxford matriculating on 8 March 1611, at the age of 17. He became a student of the Middle Temple in 1613. He was knighted by King James I at his Court at Newmarket on 12 February 1624. He was landowner of Oxton and Kenton and in November 1639 he became High Sheriff of Devon.William George Willis Watson The house of Martin In 1641, in a year of plots and treasons, Martyn was proclaimed a traitor by the king, and he was excepted from the offer of a general pardon together with Sir George Chudleigh, Sir John Northcote, and Sir Samuel Rolle. He was included in an order clearing proclaimed persons issued on 7 December 1642. In June 1646, he was elected Member of Parliament for Devon in the Long Parliament. He was added to the committee of militia for Devon in 1648 and was excluded under Pride's Purge at the end of the year. Martyn died at Netherex at the age of 59. It is said that before he died, as he lay sick at his house, one of the bells of the church began to toll of its own accord and continued for about a quarter of an hour until the time of his death. A monument was erected in Kenton church. Martyn married Elizabeth Symes, of Pounsford, Somerset. His daughter, who married a wollen draper of Watling Street in the city, provided sanctuary for the five members that King Charles tried to arrest in the House of Commons.

Parataxical integration exists when two people, usually intimate with each other (i.e. parents and children, spouses, romantic partners, business associates), are reciprocally reactive to each other‚Äôs seductions, judgmental inaccuracies, hostile comments, and manipulations or other \\"triggering\\" behaviors. One says or does something causing the other to react, setting off a cyclical \\"ping-pong\\", \\"tit-for-tat\\", \\"you-get-me-and-I-get-you-back\\" oscillation of verbal and/or behavioral reactions. Development The concept first appeared in Sullivan's The Interpersonal Theory of Psychiatry, published in 1953. It was developed further by his prot√©g√©, Lorna Smith Benjamin, in her Interpersonal Diagnosis and Treatment of Personality Disorders (1996). Benjamin saw parataxical integration as typical in the interpersonal behavior of couples with unresolved autonomy (i.e. separation, boundary) and identity issues. Erik Erikson had himself described the unconscious, reciprocal reactivation (without using Sullivan‚Äôs terms) in his essay, ‚ÄúThe Problem of Ego Identity,‚Äù and in Identity and Anxiety, by Stein et al. (1960). Usage Though the term itself is not used in much of the professional peer-reviewed literature, the interpersonal manifestation to which it refers appears regularly in the case study literature of the \\"family systems\\" school of psychologists, including Don D. Jackson, Jay Haley, Gregory Bateson, Virginia Satir, and Salvador Minuchin. Parataxical integrations are also presented in similar studies reported by Ronald D. Laing, Aaron Esterson, and anthropologist Jules Henry, largely during the 1950s and 1960s. Harold Searles and Charles McCormack describe manifestations of parataxical integration in their works on borderline personality disorders in the 1980s and 2000s. Paul Watzlawick et al. describes the concept in his book, Change, noting, \\"... the circularity of their interaction makes it undecidable ... whether a given action is the cause or effect of an action by the other party ... either party sees its actions as determined and provoked by the other's actions ...\\". Rodger Garrett also employs the concept in his millennial-era work on borderline personality disorder and family of origin etiology, typically using the term ‚Äúreciprocal reactivity‚Äù along with it. Reciprocal reactivity was studied by Gary Sperduto et al. in the 1970s, and it is clear from the abstract of his paper (see below) that his definitional terminology equated to that of Sullivan. Numerous mass-market psychology authors, many writing about the topic of \\"co-dependence,\\" including Melody Beattie, Pia Mellody, Anne Wilson Schaef, and Barry & Janae Weinhold, describe the interpersonal manifestation without using Sullivan‚Äôs term per se. Co-dependence expert Pia Mellody describes the behavioral manifestations of parataxical integration at length in an audio presentation available online. Sources L.

He joined the Union Army at the outbreak of the Civil War as a 2nd lieutenant in Battery D, 5th United States Artillery commanded by 1st Lieutenant Charles E. Hazlett. Gettysburg On the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg, Hazlett's Battery (3rd Division, V Corps), consisting of six 3-inch 10-pdr Parrott rifles, was rushed to the top of Little Round Top by Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren. Maneuvering the guns by hand up the steep and rocky slope of the hill was a difficult achievement. However, this effort had little effect on the action of July 2. The artillerymen were exposed to constant Confederate sniper fire and could not work the guns effectively. More significantly, they could not depress the guns' barrels sufficiently to defend against incoming infantry attacks.Pfanz, pp. 223-24. During the intense fighting, Hazlett was mortally wounded and command of the battery passed to Rittenhouse. Brig. Gen. Henry Hunt, the Union chief of artillery, was with Rittenhouse when the Confederate cannonade of July 3 began. They tried to estimate the number of Confederate guns.The Artillery of Gettysburg, Bradley M. Gottfried, p. 195.

In August 1864, Rittenhouse was brevetted to captain and to major in March 1865. Post-war & personal life Rittenhouse was married to Elizabeth Shapter (1842‚Äì1904) in 1868 and together they had four children: Benjamin Franklin (b. 1869), Sterling (1873‚Äì1875), Elizabeth Caldwell (1877-1904), and Basil Norris (1879‚Äì1945).

He is regarded as the Henri Langlois of India because of his lifelong dedication towards the preservation of films in India. A passionate film archivist, he worked at the NFAI for over three decades, collecting films from India and from all over the world. He was instrumental in acquiring for the archive several landmark Indian films like Dadasaheb Phalke's Raja Harishchandra and Kaliya Mardan, Bombay Talkies films such as Jeevan Naiya, Bandhan, Kangan, Achhut Kanya and Kismet, S. S. Vasan's Chandralekha and Uday Shankar's Kalpana. In 2012, Celluloid Man, an award- winning documentary was made on his life and works, by Shivendra Singh Dungarpur.  Early life and education  Born and brought up in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, Nair developed an interest in cinema early in his life. His initiation into films began with Tamil mythological films in the early 1940s such as K. Subramaniam's Ananthasayanam and Bhakta Prahlada. His fascination for cinema began here, though his family did not support his interest in films. He graduated in science from the University of Kerala in 1953. Soon afterwards, he went to Bombay to pursue a career in filmmaking.  Film and Television Institute of India  Though he got some practical training in branches of film making from film makers of Bombay, particularly Mehboob Khan, Bimal Roy and Hrishikesh Mukherjee, he realised that he did not have the ideal qualities to become a filmmaker himself. His interest lay more in the field of academics. As advised by Jean Bhownagary of Films Division of India, he appeared for an interview at the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), was selected and joined the institute in March 1961 in the position of research assistant. While at FTII, he assisted Marie Seton and Professor Satish Bahadur in initiating and conducting the film appreciation classes of FTII. He also conducted early work to establish the film archive set up as a separate wing of FTII. He corresponded with the curators and directors of established film archives in the UK, USA, France, Italy, Poland, Soviet Union and other countries. All of them advised an independent autonomous entity for NFAI and not as a wing of FTII.  National Film Archive of India  The National Film Archive of India was founded in 1964 and Nair was appointed to the post of assistant curator in November 1965. He established the archive from scratch by collecting films from all over India and the world and was promoted as director of the archive in 1982. He spearheaded the NFAI, Pune for nearly three decades and built up the archive which now enjoys a vibrant international reputation. Landmark acquisitions include the Dadasaheb Phalke films and films of New Theatres, Bombay Talkies, Minerva Movietone, Wadia Movietone, Gemini Studios and AVM Productions. He was instrumental in introducing the works of world masters of cinema like Ingmar Bergman, Akira Kurosawa, Andrzej Wajda, Mikl√≥s Jancs√≥, Krzysztof Zanussi, Vittorio De Sica, Federico Fellini, apart from significant Indian film makers like Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, Mrinal Sen, V. Shantaram, Raj Kapoor and Guru Dutt to FTII students, film society members, and other film study groups in the country. He was also instrumental in setting up the International Film Festival of Kerala. When he retired in April 1991, he had collected over 12,000 films, of which 8,000 were Indian. Post-retirement After his retirement, he lived in Pune not very far away from the NFAI and the Film and Television Institute of India. After a prolonged illness he died on March 4, 2016 at Sahyadri Nursing Home in Pune. He is survived by a daughter who lives in Thiruvananthapuram and two sons who live in Pune and Canada. Awards and recognition Nair was awarded the Satyajit Ray Memorial Award in 2008. Shivendra Singh Dungarpur, a film archivist who considered Nair his \\"guru\\", produced Celluloid Man, a documentary chronicling the life of Nair. The documentary premiered at the Il Cinema Ritrovato in Bologna, Italy in June 2012. Later it won two National Awards at the 60th National Film Awards, including Best Biographical Film and Best Editing. The film was released in India on 3 May 2013 to coincide with the centenary of Indian cinema.

It constitutes a \\"formal description of the musical intuitions of a listener who is experienced in a musical idiom\\"Lerdahl, Fred/Jackendoff, Ray (1983): A Generative Theory of Tonal Music, Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, p. 1. with the aim of illuminating the unique human capacity for musical understanding.Lerdahl, Fred and Ray Jackendoff (1983). A generative theory of tonal music. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. The collaboration between Lerdahl and Jackendoff was inspired by Leonard Bernstein's 1973 Charles Eliot Norton Lectures at Harvard University, wherein he called for researchers to uncover a musical grammar that could explain the human musical mind in a scientific manner comparable to Noam Chomsky's revolutionary transformational or generative grammar.Chomsky, Noam (1957). Syntactic Structures. The Hague: Mouton; Chomsky, Noam (1965). Aspects of the Theory of Syntax. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Chomsky, Noam (1966). Topics in the Theory of Generative Grammar. The Hague: Mouton. Unlike the major methodologies of music analysis that preceded it, GTTM construes the mental procedures under which the listener constructs an unconscious understanding of music, and uses these tools to illuminate the structure of individual compositions. The theory has been influential, spurring further work by its authors and other researchers in the fields of music theory, music cognition and cognitive musicology.Jackendoff, Ray (1987). Consciousness and the Computational Mind. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Temperley, David (2001). The Cognition of Basic Musical Structures. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Lerdahl, Fred (2001). Tonal Pitch Space. New York: Oxford University Press; Lerdahl, F., & R. Jackendoff (2006). The Capacity for Music: What Is It, and What's Special About It? Cognition, 100.1, 33‚Äì72. The theory GTTM focuses on four hierarchical systems that shape our musical intuitions. Each of these systems is expressed in a strict hierarchical structure where dominant regions contain smaller subordinate elements and equal elements exist contiguously within a particular and explicit hierarchical level. In GTTM any level can be small-scale or large-scale depending on the size of its elements. =The structures= I. Grouping structure GTTM considers grouping analysis to be the most basic component of musical understanding. It expresses a hierarchical segmentation of the piece into motives, phrases, periods and still larger sections. II. Metrical structure Metrical structure expresses the intuition that the events of a piece are related to a regular alternation of strong and weak beats at a number of hierarchical levels. It is a crucial basis for all the structures and reductions of GTTM. III. Time-span reduction Time-span reductions (TSRs) are based on information gleaned from metrical and grouping structures. They establish tree structure-style hierarchical organizations uniting time-spans at all temporal levels of a work.Their function is double: they establish tree structure relations (time-span trees), and they provide rhythmic criteria to supplement pitch criteria that determine the structural importance of events (p. 119). The TSR analysis begins at the smallest levels, where metrical structure marks off the music into beats of equal length (or more precisely into attack points separated by uniform time-spansA time-span is a length of time spanning from one metrical event up to, but not including, the next event. (This is the minimal condition on time-spans.)) and moves through all larger levels where grouping structure divides the music into motives, phrases, periods, theme groups and still greater divisions. It further specifies a ‚Äúhead‚Äù (or most structurally important event) for each time-span at all hierarchical levels of the analysis. A completed TSR analysis is often called a time-span tree. IV. Prolongational reduction Prolongational reduction (PR) provides our \\"psychological\\" awareness of tensing and relaxing patterns in a given piece with precise structural terms. In time-span reduction, the hierarchy of less and more important events is established according to rhythmic stability. In prolongational reduction, hierarchy is concerned with relative stability expressed in terms of continuity and progression, the movement toward tension or relaxation, and the degree of closure or non-closure. A PR analysis also produces a tree-structure style hierarchical analysis, but this information is often conveyed in a visually condensed modified \\"slur\\" notation. The need for prolongational reduction mainly arises from two limitations of time-span reductions. The first is that time-span reduction fails to express the sense of continuity produced by harmonic rhythm.Harmonic rhythm is the pattern of durations produced by changes in the harmony at the musical surface. The second is that time-span reduction‚Äîeven though it establishes that particular pitch-events are heard in relation to a particular beat, within a particular group‚Äîfails to say anything about how music flows across these segments.F. Lerdahl and R. Jackendoff (1983). The generative theory of tonal music. p.122 =More on TSR vs. PR= It is helpful to note some basic differences between a time-span tree produced by TSR and a prolongational tree produced by PR. First, though the basic branching divisions produced by the two trees are often the same or similar at high structural levels, branching variations between the two trees are often observed as one travels further down towards the musical surface. A second and equally important differentiation is that a prolongational tree carries three types of branching: strong prolongation (represented by an open node at the branching point), weak prolongation (represented by a filled node at the branching point) and progression (represented by simple branching, with no node). Time-span trees do not make this distinction. All time-span trees branches are simple branches without nodes. (Although time-span tree branches are often annotated with other helpful comments.) The rules Each of the four major hierarchical organizations (grouping structure, metrical structure, time-span reduction and prolongational reduction) is established through rules, which are divided into three categories: #The well-formedness rules, which specify possible structural descriptions. #The preference rules, which draw on possible structural descriptions eliciting those descriptions that correspond to experienced listeners‚Äô hearings of any particular piece. #The transformational rules, which provide a means of associating distorted structures with well-formed descriptions. =I.

Aixa was also known by the Muslims as Aisha al-Horra (meaning the honored), due to the fact that she was one of the living descendants of the Prophet Muhammed. She was politically active and exerted influence upon the policy of state during the last years of the Emirate of Granada. Aixa is one of the best known women of the history of the Emirate of Granada. Life Aixa was born a member of the ruling Nasrid dynasty of Granada, likely the daughter of Muhammed IX. She personally owned several palaces and properties. Aixa was first married to Muhammed XI; after his death in 1455, she was married by his successor Said to his heir, Abu l-Hasan Ali. Her second marriage was likely an attempt to make peace between the rival factions of the dynasty. Aixa was exiled to another palace with her sons after her spouse fell in love with his Christian slave Isabel de Sol√≠s and married her. In 1482, Aixa allied herself with the opposition party Abencerrages and had her husband deposed in favour of her son. Aixa was politically active during the reign of her son Muhammed XII, also known as Boabdil. She is said to have prevented harassment of the Christians in Granada. In 1483, she handled the negotiations for the release of her son, who had been taken captive by Castile. Aixa was known to be an extreme patriot, since she wanted to continue to fight to the death using women, children, and old men, even though the army of Granada was defeated by Ferdinand and Isabella of Castile and Aragon. She blamed the defeat on traitors in the kingdom who allowed themselves to betray their country for large sums of money and property if they would convince their king to surrender the Kingdom of Granada. After the fall of Granada in 1492, she followed her son into exile‚Äîfirst to Alpujarras, and in 1493 to Fes. A famous legend says that when her deposed son Muhammad XII left Granada after its fall, he turned around and looked back upon it. Aixa then replied: :\\"You weep like a woman for what you could not defend as a man.\\" :ÿßÿ®ŸÉ ÿßŸÑŸäŸàŸÖ ÿ®ŸÉÿßÿ° ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ≥ÿßÿ° ÿπŸÑŸâ ŸÖŸÑŸÉ ŸÑŸÖ ÿ™ÿ≠ŸÅÿ∏Ÿá ÿ≠ŸÅÿ∏ ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ¨ÿßŸÑ :Ibki l-yawma bukƒÅ'a n-nisƒÅ'i  øalƒÅ mulkin lam ta·∏•fadhu ·∏•ifdha r-rijƒÅl Sources * Dolores Mir√≥n, Universidad de Granada, Andaluc√≠a Comunidad Cultural, Biograf√≠as de Mujeres Andaluzas Aixa * Carpeta Did√°ctica : al-Andalus Al-√Åndalus III: el Sultanato De Granada (1232-1492) y Una Breve Rese√±a Sobre la Alhambra * R.H.
