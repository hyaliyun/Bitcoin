She is a senior investigator and radiation epidemiology branch chief at the National Cancer Institute.  Education  Berrington de Gonz√°lez received a D.Phil. in Cancer Epidemiology from the University of Oxford. Her 2001 dissertation was titled Epidemiological evidence for the risk of cancer from diagnostic X-rays. Her university supervisors were Sarah Darby and David Cox.  Career  Berrington de Gonz√°lez was on the faculty at the University of Oxford and then Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health before moving to the Radiation Epidemiology Branch at NCI in 2008. She was awarded NIH scientific tenure in 2012, and was promoted to Branch Chief in 2014. She is a senior investigator in the Radiation Epidemiology Branch. Berrington de Gonz√°lez serves on two radiation risk committees for the National Academy of Science and previously served on the UK Health Protection Agency's Advisory Group on Ionising Radiation, and the UK Breast Screening Programme's Advisory Group. Berrington de Gonz√°lez is currently a member of the NAS Nuclear and Radiation Studies Board and has participated in many national and international radiation committees. She served on the editorial board for the American Journal of Epidemiology. Berrington de Gonz√°lez is co-PI of the UK Pediatric CT scans cohort, which was the first epidemiological study to suggest a direct link between CT scans and subsequent cancer risk. She also leads studies on the risk of second cancer after proton therapy and other emerging radiotherapy techniques.  Research  The overarching goal of Berrington de Gonz√°lez's research is to quantify the potential cancer risks from this important source of radiation exposure in order to provide information for public health and clinical purposes. Her interdisciplinary training in epidemiology and biostatistics allow her to pursue this goal using both theoretical risk projection modeling and also by conducting epidemiological studies of medically exposed populations. The studies vary across the dose-spectrum from low-dose diagnostic and screening procedures to high-dose radiotherapy, with distinct opportunities and challenges in each area. = Diagnostic and screening tests = Berrington de Gonz√°lez has conducted a series of risk projection studies to estimate the potential cancer risks from both diagnostic and screening examinations, including: cardiac stress tests, CT colonography and lung CT screening. To perform these studies she and other collaborators developed the NCI Radiation Risk Assessment Tool (RadRAT), which is interactive computer software that uses state of the art risk projection models to estimate lifetime cancer risks and incorporates Monte Carlo simulation methods to assess the impact of uncertainties in the assumptions and data. She recently became the NCI Principal Investigator for the UK Pediatric CT scans study, which is a retrospective cohort study of 250,000 children who had one or more CT scans as children or adolescents. = Therapeutic radiation exposure = Berrington de Gonz√°lez has conducted a number of studies using the SEER cancer registries to evaluate patterns of second cancers and the second cancer risks related to radiotherapy treatment. She is currently developing a cohort of breast cancer survivors using the electronic medical records from Kaiser Permanente Health Plans to study the late effects of various breast cancer treatments. She is also developing methods to project risks from high-doses of radiation exposure and conducting a pilot study to assess the feasibility of performing the first multi-center study of the second cancer risks from proton therapy and IMRT.  Awards and honors  Berrington de Gonz√°lez is an elected member of the American Epidemiological Society.

After graduating in medicine in 1947, Hargrave took a house job at Westminster Hospital after which he completed his national service with the Royal Air Force in Egypt and Kenya. Upon returning to Wootton Bassett in 1950, he became a general practitioner and a clinical assistant to the ear, nose and throat clinic at the Princess Margaret Hospital, Swindon.

Early life Michael Hargrave was born on 8 December 1923, in Simla, British India, the elder of two sons of a decorated First World War pilot who was posted there by the Royal Air Force. Hargrave was sent to England to attend Harcourt Preparatory School at Weyhill, following which he attended St Edward's School, Oxford.

In April 1945, he was among eleven medical students from Westminster who volunteered to help relieve a famine in Holland, a part of the Netherlands still occupied by the Germans but awaiting liberation. On the day of departure, the students were informed that they were instead being sent to help at the recently liberated Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany. At Belsen, army medics were trying to prevent the spread of disease and save those they could. Hargrave described in his daily journal the process by which the huts in Camp One were cleaned, disinfected and turned into basic temporary hospitals, after which its inmates were cleaned, disinfected and then moved out. He led this process in hut 210 and performed treatments including the excision of eyelid cysts and tuberculous glands in the neck. He became accustomed to seeing boils, gangrene, diarrhoea, typhus and severe malnutrition. Supervision and briefings were given by nutritionist Arnold Peter Meiklejohn, Brigadier Hugh Glyn-Hughes and Colonel James Johnston. Hargrave also taught a Polish girl, Zosia Wi≈õniowska, how to speak English. Career In 1947, Hargrave graduated in medicine and took up his first house job at Westminster Hospital.

Family Hargrave married nurse Joy Thompson in 1948, a year after qualifying as a doctor. They had a daughter, Sally, and a son, David. Both developed polio in 1953, two years before the first injectable Salk vaccine. David made a full recovery, but Sally, who was nine months old at the time, was left with a paralysed leg. She became a secretary and David a GP in Portland, Dorset. Death and legacy Hargrave was diagnosed with a brain tumour, and died on 25 July 1974.

World War II 1 AA Group was formed on 1 October 1942 when Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick 'Tim' Pile, Commander-in-Chief of Anti-Aircraft Command (AA Command), scrapped its previous conventional structure of Corps and Divisions.

However, in January 1944 it resumed night raids on London, which became known as the 'Baby Blitz'. These raids employed new faster bombers with sophisticated 'pathfinder' techniques and radar jamming. For example, on the night of 21 January 200 hostile aircraft were plotted approaching the South Coast in two waves, which intermingled with returning aircraft of RAF Bomber Command. This caused problems of identification and restrictions on fire, but the guns of 2 AA Group and then 1 AA Group engaged as the raiders approached London. Only one-fifth of the raiders reached the city, the remainder turning away to bomb open country. AA guns brought down eight aircraft and RAF Night fighters with S/L assistance also had successes. At the end of January London Docks received a 130-strong raid dropping flares and incendiaries as they had in the London Blitz of 1940‚Äì41: about one-third reached their target and five were shot down. February began with a 75-strong raid, of which only 12 reached the IAZ and four were shot down. On 13 February only six out of 115 bombers reached London. The climax came with five raids in the week 18‚Äì25 February varying from 100 to 140 in strength. These met intense AA fire from the Thames Estuary onwards and fewer than half made it to central London: the AA score was 13 shot down while the night fighters and S/Ls added 15, with another shared. Facing these casualty rates, the Luftwaffe switched to targets away from London until 24 March, when a 100-strong raid on London lost four aircraft, and finally on 18 April a raid of 125 aircraft lost 14 shot down and only 30 reached the IAZ. Although much damage was caused in London, the rising efficiency of the HAA guns and radar made the enemy's losses unsustainable.Collier, Chapter XXI.Collier, Table XLII.Routledge, pp. 409‚Äì10. By February 1944, 1 AA Gp was responsible for the AA Operations Room at Brompton Road and the following GORs: * 301 Stanmore * 320 Hastings * 329 Vange * 330 Chelmsford together with a number of ordnance depots and miscellaneous establishments, including the AA Command Staff Duties School, Research Workshops and Camouflage Experimental Section, and 37 Radio Installation Detachment. In May 1944 the group was joined by 99 Group, Pioneer Corps, with 801, 809, 814, 817, 818, 841 and 844 semi-mobile smoke companies (in August 801 and 841 Companies were replaced by 4 Company, Non-Combatant Corps). =Operation Diver= Ground crew prepare a V-1 for launch. AA Command had been steadily losing men and units to the build-up of 21st Army Group for the planned Allied invasion of Europe (Operation Overlord). In April 1944, while the Baby Blitz was still under way, it was ordered to deploy much of its strength to defend the Overlord concentration areas and embarkation ports. In addition, it was preparing for the anticipated arrival of V-1 flying bombs, codenamed 'Divers'. In the event, the first of these did not arrive over England until a week after the D Day landings had begun, and AA units were able to redeploy from their Overlord sites to begin Operation Diver. However, early results of AA fire by 1 and 2 AA Groups against the small, fast, low- flying missiles were disappointing. Even shooting down those that reached the IAZ caused significant damage, so a ban was imposed on fire in this area.Routledge, pp. 408‚Äì12. ATS members operating an AA identification telescope at a 3.7-inch gun site firing against V-1 flying bombs, 21 July 1944. At the end of June Pile ordered a change in AA Command's tactics: instead of deploying mobile 3.7-inch guns in the Diver Belt, the most up-to- date power-controlled static guns, radars and predictors would be used, which involved a massive redeployment of guns uprooted from all over Britain and emplaced on temporary 'Pile Platforms'. The task was made bigger by the decision to move the Diver Belts to the coast itself, giving the guns a free fire zone out to sea. On 16 July 1 AA Group was ordered to form a 'Diver Box' of gun defences across the Thames Estuary, forward of a line from Chelmsford in Essex to Chatham, Kent. The removal of so many guns, and the silencing of those remaining in the IAZ, led Londoners to believe that the city was being defended by the RAF alone.Routledge, pp. 412‚Äì16. 3.7-inch HAA gun in action near London, 29 August 1944 (note AA shell bursts in the distance). As 21st Army Group began to overrun the V-1 launching sites in Northern France, the Luftwaffe turned to launching the missiles from aircraft over the North Sea, and 1 AA Group's Diver Box was heavily engaged. It was equipped with 136 Mark IIC 3.7-inch guns with No 10 Predictors and SCR-584 radar (some manned by three US Army AA Artillery battalions), 210 Bofors guns, and two Z Batteries of mobile nine-rocket launchers manned by a converted S/L regiment. The HAA guns began using the proximity VT fuze with great success. A number of the guns were mounted on the Maunsell Forts in the Thames Estuary. In addition there were 400 20mm guns provided by the RAF Regiment and the Royal Navy. To control these guns the Box was divided into four sectors under 37, 49, 56 and 68 AA Brigades.Routledge, pp. 413‚Äì15. A Heinkel He 111 H-22 carrying a V-1 flying bomb. Success rates for AA Command began to rise during this second Diver deployment: from a 9 per cent success rate in July, the average rose to over 50 per cent. On one day 68 missiles were destroyed out of 96 plotted. The weekly total of missiles reaching London fell from a peak of 362 in July to 100, then down to 10 in September. A further redeployment of guns from the South Coast through London to the East Coast was ordered on 21 September. 3 AA Group HQ was brought from Bristol to take over command of the London IAZ, and a new 9 AA Group took over East Anglia, leaving 1 AA Group to concentrate on the Diver Box and the Thames/Medway and Dover defences (though this was still a massive command temporarily controlling 10 AA brigades). The second phase of V-1 attacks ended in mid-January 1945. AA Command's success rate in this phase was impressive: out of a total of 492 V-1 targets, 320 were shot down, and only 13 reached London.Routledge, pp. 415‚Äì18. =Order of Battle late 1944= From mid-October 1944, 1 AA Group had the following order of battle: Static 3.7-inch HAA gun on a Pile Platform in action in Essex, 9 October 1944.* 5 AA Bde ** 1 HAA rgt; 3 LAA rgts * 26 AA Bde ** 4 HAA rgts; 1 AA area mixed rgt * 28 AA Bde ** 2 HAA rgts; 2 LAA rgts * 37 AA Brigade ** 4 HAA rgts; 3 LAA rgts * 40 AA Bde ** 4 HAA rgts; 2 LAA rgts * 48 AA Brigade ** 2 HAA rgts * 49 AA Brigade ** 2 S/L rgts; 2 AA area mixed rgts * 56 AA Brigade ** 6 S/L rgts * 57 AA Brigade ** 2 HAA rgts; 3 LAA rgts * 102 AA Brigade ** 1 HAA rgt; 4 LAA rgts In October 1944, 1 AA Group's HQ establishment comprised 49 officers, 27 male other ranks, and 105 ATS personnel.AA Command Organisation Table, October‚ÄìNovember 1944, TNA file WO 212/148.

As the Cold War developed, there was a need for new weapons, leading to the rise of Surface- to-air missiles and 'blind fire' radar control, with the consequent decline of HAA guns and searchlights. There was also political pressure for defence budget cuts. In March 1955 AA Command and its groups were disbanded and the remaining AA defence units in the UK came under control of the Home Commands and Districts.Routledge, Chapter 31. 1 AA Group completed its disbandment on 31 October 1955.

He wrote several influential books on Swiss rudimental drumming, or Basler Trommeln, that are still thought of as the authoritative sources for Swiss drumming in America. Biography Dr. Fritz Robert Berger was born in 1895 in Switzerland and is sometimes referred to as the \\"Drummel-Doggter\\". He studied the Basel style of snare drumming, called Basler Trommeln or Basle Trommel, and published the book Das Basler Trommeln, Werden und Wesen Berger, Franz. Das Basler Trommeln, Werden und Wesen. Trommel Verlag, 1928. in 1928. This book outlined the Swiss rudimental system in a novel notation system that was much easier to read for drummers from outside of the Basel tradition. Previously, Basel notation had been either onomatopoetic, using syllables written out in letters to represent the rhythms, or later a set of symbols or hieroglyphics that were difficult to understand (without Basel-specific training).Beck, John H. Encyclopedia of Percussion. Routledge, 2013. Neither system used the normal elements of western music notation. Berger's monolinear notation system used established musical note values and symbols and placed them on a single-line staff. Similarly to other rudimental notation systems in America, Scotland, and France, his system placed right hand notes above the line and the left hand notes below it so that the sticking was obvious.Dean, Matt. The Drum: A History. Scarecrow, 2011. In the 1930s, Berger travelled around North America teaching his Swiss rudimental style to various drum corps, marching bands, and rudimental percussionists who had largely not been familiar with Swiss drumming before his arrival.Bloom, Ryan Alexander. Encyclopedia Rudimentia. New York: Hudson Music, 2019. Berger's Swiss student Alfons Grieder continued to promote Berger's interpretation of Swiss drumming in North America, starting in the 1960s, long after Dr. Berger returned to Europe.Chandler, Eric Alan, \\"A History of Rudimental Drumming in America From the Revolutionary War to the Present.\\" (1990). LSU Historical Dissertations and Theses. 4901. Berger is known to have performed Liberman's Giegy Festival Concerto for Basle Trommel and Orchestra several times, including a performance as late as 1961 at Royal Albert Hall in England for the BBC Festival of Light.Blades, James. Percussion Instruments and Their History. Bold Strummer, 1992. Later in life, Berger wrote additional books on Basel drumming such as Das Basler Trommeln in 1956 for the Swiss audience and Instructor for Basle Drumming, Berger, Fritz. Instructor for Basle Drumming.Basel: Trommel Verlag, 1964. which was published in 1964, just after his death, and circulated widely in American Ancient Drumming circles. He also published several pieces of music, including 3 volumes of Trommelm√§rsche between 1959 and 1965.Berger, Fritz. Trommelm√§rsche. Vols 1-3. Basel: Trommel Verlag, 1959-1965. The Berger Lesson 25 is a Hybrid Rudiment named for Fritz Berger. It is primarily due to Berger's (and later Grieder's) influence that the Percussive Arts Society 40 International Rudiments sheet includes the Swiss rudiment the Single Flammed Mill and uses the Swiss names Swiss Army Triplet and Flam Tap in place of the Ancient American equivalents. This naming convention appears to be a point of contention for Jack Pratt and the International Association of Traditional Drummers who vocally object to the Swiss influence on American rudiments Publications *Das Basler Trommeln, Werden und Wesen - 1928 *Das Basler Trommeln - 1956 *Instructor for Basle Drumming - 1964 *Trommelm√§rsche Vols 1-3 - 1959-1965  References  Category:1895 births Category:1963 deaths Category:20th-century male musicians ","title":"Fritz Berger (percussionist)"},{"id":"61866631","text":"Cork and Youghal Railway (from Viceregal Commission 1906 map) GS&WR; Penrose Quay and C&YR; Summerhill stations The Cork and Youghal Railway (C&YR;) was a company that built and operated a short railway built in the early 1860s in Ireland linking Cork with Youghal, a small resort with harbour at the mouth of the Munster Blackwater. There was an additional branch to Cobh (Queenstown), a deepwater port in Cork Harbour associated with transatlantic liners. The railway was forced into administration within a few short years due to the bankruptcy of major shareholder David Leopold Lewis and was taken over by the much larger Great Southern and Western Railway (GS&WR;). The branch to Cobh became the main line and by the late 1980s was the only part of the previously extensive rail network around Cork City to remain operational apart from the main line to Dublin. 2009 seen the Youghal branch re-open to while the remainder of the route is being converted to a greenway in the 2020s. History =C&YR;= A group company called the Cork and Waterford Railway was established in the 1840 which explored a route between the two major south coast cities via Youghal and Dungarvan. Had this come to fruition it has been commented the traffic levels on the line would likely have been significantly larger. The rights to build a line from Cork to Youghal was established in law in 1854. The C&YR; was initially under the chairmanship of Isaac Butt, member of Parliament for Youghal, and leader of the Irish Party in the House of Commons. Little progress seems to have been made until the arrival of a financier from London, David Leopold Lewis. Lewis had grand plans to turn Youghal into a \\"Brighton-by-the-sea\\" resort and approached the project with gusto, not only buying C&YR; shares at a 40% premium, acquiring a pleasure steamer to trips up the Munster Blackwater, and culminating in the purchasing of most the town of Youghal from William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire in 1861. Butt was replaced in 1959 by Cusack Patrick Roney who had board level experience with the Cambridge and Lincoln Railway Company and Eastern Counties Railway in England; and the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada. Murray and McNeil credit Roney with keeping the C&YR; enterprise going despite the activities of Lewis; though Roney does seem to extol the railway; Youghal with its rejunvination by Lewis; and the Lewis pleasure steamship trip up the Blackwater in his book How to Spend a Month in Ireland. 10 November 1859 saw the to section of the line opened for traffic by George Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland who also cut the first sod of the Cobh branch and knighted John Arnott, the incumbent Lord Mayor of Cork and a C&YR; director, all on the same day. Passengers were conveyed the two miles from King Street in Cork to Dunkettle by horse omnibus, an extra 40 minutes being allowed. Services extended to Youghal from 23 May 1860. From 1 October 1860 until May 1861 a temporary way was laid to the new terminus at , passing over the tunnel of the Dublin main line and convenient to the GS&WR; Penrose Quay station, carriages on that section being hauled by Flemish horses. Following the laying of the permanent way the first scheduled first steam-hauled train for Youghal departed Cork Summerhill on 30 December 1861 at 09:45. The progress on the line to Cobh was delayed by The Admiralty being concerned that the six span steel bridge to Fota Island and the Belvelly bridge to Great Island would be a hindrance to navigation. Transatlantic liners had been calling at Cobh since the 1850s and the traffic on the Cobh branch was to exceed than on the Youghal line. The C&YR; seems to have been marketed as the Cork, Youghal and Queenstown Direct after this time, and seems to have been successful in capturing traffic from the Cork, Blackrock and Passage Railway and their ferries. Lewis's financial over-ambition caught up with him in 1865, he was to be made bankrupt for the third time, owing ¬£850,000. His only assets being C&YR; shares this contributed to the GS&WR; taking over operation of the railway from 1865 and buying it completely in 1866 for ¬£310,000. Lewis was sent to gaol and died in 1868 with this emerging to have been his third bankruptcy. Roney also was to die in 1868 before he was 60. =GS&WR;= The GS&WR; found the C&YR; to be in a run-down condition but took steps to improve it to GS&WR; standards, to the extent shareholders complained about the expenditures. The GS&WR; implemented a junction from their line to the C&YR; line in 1868. and doubled the line first to Cobh Junction in 1869, and then to Cobh in 1882, making in the main line with mileposts from . The line to Youghal then became the branch and the mileposts measured from Cobh Junction as zero. The GS&WR; also paid substantially for a deep water harbour at Cobh. From 1 July 1876 the Dublin to Cork daily mail train was extended to Cobh. It was known as the \\"American Mail\\" as it was possible to take mail from liner, transport it to Dublin for the steam Packets to mainland Britain and train to London, thereby cutting the delivery time by a day. In 1893 the GS&WR; closed their Dublin Penrose Quay station and the Summerhill station and replaced them with , originally known as Glanmire Road. As with other railways Civil unrest took its toll with the bridges to Great Island destroyed on 8 August 1922. The Daytime mail trains were stopped from running through to Cobh after this point. =GSR, CI√â and Irish Rail= The lines passed to the Great Southern Railways (GSR) with the amalgamation of 1925. Nationalisation into CI√â followed some twenty years later in 1945 with control passing to Iarnr√≥d √âireann (Irish Rail) in 1987. Up to the 1960s Cobh had been the main departure point for Irish Emigrants to America, thereafter transatlantic air travel began to dominate and the liner trade died off. More recently this has been replaced to some extent by Cruise Ship tourists. The last regular scheduled passenger train between Cobh Junction to Youghal ran on 2 February 1963 and was subsequently replaced by a bus service. On 30 July 2009 following a 35-year campaign the line was re-opened to at a cost of ‚Ç¨75m. In July 2015 Irish Rail indicated they had no intention of re-opening to Youghal as funds would be better spent on the existing network. They indicated they supported a Greenway as it would free them from existing maintenance costs whilst retaining a license to re-open the route in the unlikely event that became an option. By April 2020 a ‚Ç¨15 euro project to open the Midleton to Youghal Greenway had begun but was being delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Route The initial main line runs in a relatively straight direction from Cork to Youghal some, to the east. The branch to Cobh (formerly Queenstown) forks off south at (formerly Cobh Junction), some from Cork. Bridges and other works take the railway via the small Harpers Island and larger Fota Island to the port town of Cobh on Great Island, the largest island in Cork Harbour. Rolling stock The C&YR; bought seven with driving wheels from Neilson and Company, and also three of the configuration with driving wheels from the same company. All passed to the GS&WR; on takeover. The company commenced with eight passenger coaches from Ashburys, Manchester, England. 20 freight wagons were built locally by Long & Co. of Youghal. Long also built a director's saloon carriage, named Crinoline. By the time of takeover the C&YR; had accumulated 25 passenger carriages and 29 wagons, all of which passed to the GS&WR.; The Railway magazine note the GS&WR; used the tank locomotives designed by Alexander McDonnell in 1883 as the preferred locomotive for the lines. The second half of the 1950s seen the replacement of steam locomotives with diesel locomotives and railcars. The lines are currently worked by diesel railcars as part of the Cork Suburban Rail services. Services The regular general service for the line remained fairly constant at about five scheduled services each way to Youghal, supplemented by freight and special trains. The Cobh branch has typically had an hourly service since 1863. Accidents The line has been relatively free of accidents. The most serious was a collision at Summerhill in which over 100 people were injured, though without fatalities, where a train ran through a signal on 9 July 1882. The derailment of a MacDonald at points may have been due to the wheel profiles being rather sharp and the track being slightly out of gauge.

It was one of the first delta wing aircraft. Design and development The first tailless aircraft that Alexander Lippisch saw was the Weltensegler glider, which flew briefly at the second Rh√∂n contest in 1921. He was impressed by its initial stability, though a turn led to an uncontrolled spiral dive followed by breakup and the death of its pilot. In response he built several models and also designed the full size but disappointing Espenlaub E 2. After some time designing more conventional types and becoming Technical Head of the RRG in 1925 he returned to the tailless glider layout. in 1927. He began in 1927 with the RRG Storch, which was rather like the Espenlaub and was progressively modified. All of these aircraft had wings with sweep on both leading and trailing edges. In 1930 his first design with a straight, unswept trailing edge flew; he named it the Delta I. left Its straight leading edge was swept at 20¬∞. Following the standard practice of the time the wing had a single spar, with plywood covering ahead of it, forming a torsion resistant D-box. There were diagonal internal struts close to the wing roots and further ply skin strengthened these areas. The rest of the wing was fabric covered. The thickness was decreased markedly by the upward slope of the underside, providing dihedral. The Delta's trailing edge was equally divided between outboard ailerons and inboard elevators. As on the Storch, the wing tips were cropped and carried small, roughly triangular, ply-covered fins mounting longer, rounded rectangular, fabric covered rudders. The inner surfaces of the fins and rudders were cambered as a conventional tail rudder would be but the outer surfaces were flat. The rudders operated independently, each with its own foot pedal. To turn to port, for example, the pilot would press only the lefthand pedal to swing its rudder outwards where it acted more like an airbrake, turning the glider to port with its drag. above: the motorized Delta IM The fuselage of the original glider was a simple, oval-section, ply-covered nacelle. Its pilot sat in an enclosed cockpit under the wing, with a transparency in the wing edge ahead and another above. A pair of smaller windows on each side provided landing views. Landings were made on a nearly nacelle-length sprung skid. There was a second cockpit at about mid-chord with another transparency above it and a pair of windows on each side. The fuselage tapered to an angled vertical knife-edge. The addition in 1931 of a pusher configuration, , horizontally opposed Bristol Cherub III well above the rear of the wing with its small, metal, two-bladed propeller just beyond the trailing edge significantly altered the fuselage, though it did not lengthen it. A raised roof line continued from the engine housing forward, providing space above the wing for three windows on each side for the observer and a more conventional, framed cockpit above and forward of the wing. The lower fuselage was modified by a fixed, tricycle undercarriage with closely spaced, trousered main legs, rubber-sprung mainwheels with low pressure tyres, a shrouded, steerable nosewheel and a little tailwheel. As a result the empty weight increased by compared with the glider. The wing remained unchanged. Sometimes known as the Lippisch Delta IM, the motorized Delta was named \\"Hermann Kohl\\" after the leader of the first East-West North Atlantic crossing. Operational history The glider version of the Delta I first flew in 1930 and took part in that year's Rh√∂n contest. RRG then converted it into the powered Delta IM and G√ºnther Groenhoff conducted its first flight in 1931. Though take-offs have been described as \\"difficult\\", Groenhoff said it was light on the controls and capable of any manoeuvres expected of conventional aircraft including a loop. Independent observers at a demonstration did not see the latter but were impressed with its manoeuvrability, its apparent reserves of power, despite the small engine, and its reluctance to stall. It flew until 1933 when it crashed heavily.

Early life and education Fanny Metcalfe was born on 1 February 1829 to Charles James and Elizabeth Metcalfe of Roxton House, Roxton, Bedfordshire. She had an older sister, Anna Sophia, and at least one brother. She was educated both at home and in Berlin. She and her sister were sent there in c. 1850 to improve their language skills and to assist them in learning the skills necessary to earn a living. With their mother, the sisters founded a school, \\"Highfield\\", in Hendon by renting a villa and opening a boarding school in 1858. Within 5 years they moved to larger purpose-built premises. Soon it was one of the top schools for young ladies. Alumnae included Ida Margaret Graves Poore and Blanche Athena Clough. Girton College Metcalfe was determined to provide excellent education for women at all levels, and with her sister's support went on to work on the setting up Hitchin College in 1869, which later became Girton College, Cambridge. She worked with Emily Davis, whose idea it was. They had met as a result of her involvement with the London Association of Schoolmistresses. Metcalfe was responsible for advising on the curriculum and disciplinary issues. These were her areas of expertise at Highfield. She also recruited students for the new college. In the early days her connection to the college was informal, but in 1869 she was appointed to the executive committee. Her experience with logistics meant that she also contributed on the planning of their buildings and gardens. Conscious that a degree course would be more difficult than the secondary education the students were used to, Metcalfe pushed for improved health care, defined tutorials and developing processes to assist the women facing the new challenge. Later life In 1882 Metcalfe went on to assist in the creation of Westfield College in London, which was headed by a Girton College alumna, Constance Maynard. Both Metcalfe and her sister Anna sat on the Westfield council at various times, and the college was located a short distance from Highfield. Metcalfe had poor health in later life but remained involved and active until she died on 30 May 1897 in Marylebone, London. She was buried in St Mary's Church, Hendon.

In 1920, he became the principal of the all-black Gay Street School in West Chester, Pennsylvania.  Early life  Joseph R. Fugett was born on June 17, 1890, in Baldwinsville, New York to Joseph Martin Fugett and Electra Josephine Bakeman Fugett. His father, Joseph Martin, was formally enslaved in the state of Tennessee; and his mother, Josephine (the daughter of Oliver Bakeman and Sarah Day Bakeman), was from the state of New York. His mother, Josephine, was a direct descendant of Revolutionary War participant, Henry Bakeman. In 1900, Fugett lived in Van Buren, New York with his parents and siblings (Frank M., Bessie J., James K. and Sarah E.). He graduated from Waterloo High School.  Education and career  Fugett attended Cornell University, where he studied agriculture and became a member of the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, the first black intercollegiate Greek-lettered fraternity. He served as general secretary of Alpha Phi Alpha from 1912 to 1913, as treasurer at the Fourth General Convention, and as incorporator when the fraternity was incorporated on April 3, 1912. On October 21, 1908, Fugett was an initiate at the Alpha Chapter Annual Banquet. In 1975, Fugett entered the Omega Chapter. After graduating from Cornell, Fugett became an animal husbandry instructor at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. He later taught at Bordentown High School in New Jersey, and at Delaware State University. He came to West Chester in 1920, and earned a master's degree in education from the University of Pennsylvania in 1926. Fugett was an active member in both the National Education Association and the Elementary School Principals Association. He was also a charter member and President of the Suburban Philadelphia Elementary School Principals Association. The State Department of Public Instruction invited Fugett to be a part of a statewide committee whose purpose was to prepare educational materials on cultural competency. In 1945, Fugett served as secretary to Major Richard R. Wright at the United Nations Conference on International Organization. During the commencement ceremony at Cheyney University in 1957, Fugett was cited for \\"advancing education, serving the community, and enlightening human relations.\\" During the second year of the West Chester NAACP, Fugett served as one of the branch officers.  Legacy  When Fugett retired as principal of the Gay Street School in June 1965, the local school board renamed the school to Fugett Elementary School in his honor. At a ceremony to formally rename the school, it was proclaimed that October 13, 1965 would be declared \\"Joseph R. Fugett Day.\\" When Fugett Elementary School closed in 1977, the Fugett name was transferred to another local school. Thus, East Junior High became J. R. Fugett Middle School. Fugett's name is included on a plaque which lists notable West Chester area teachers. For many years, Fugett lived in West Chester, Pennsylvania, with his wife, Hazel Estelle Schloss Fugett (November 11, 1892 ‚Äì January 9, 1965), and two sons, Joseph R. Fugett Jr. and Jean Schloss Fugett Sr. (November 5, 1927 ‚Äì July 19, 2016). In 2004, Fugett's son, Jean Schloss Fugett Sr., became the first black man to join the Maryland division of the Sons of the American Revolution (SAR).

Operational history Upon introduction the boat immediately became a commercial success and racing fleets were quickly started in North America, Europe and Australia. The International Hobie Class Association describes the boat's sailing characteristics: \\"the 17 is a heavy air machine. The added leverage of the wings for trapezing makes the 17 go upwind like no other catamaran, and the main is easily depowered with a 6:1 downhaul, the mast rotator, 2:1 outhaul and a 7:1 mainsheet. Downwind, the boat is pitchpole resistant (not ‚Äúproof‚Äù) and a bit underpowered, which makes working the waves a high priority. Downwind, the boat is sailed at 90¬∞ to the apparent wind. The 17 is uncomfortable to race in under 7 knots of breeze, since most of the time you'll be sitting on the forward wing tube. Weight is kept as far forward as possible while keeping the bow tips out of waves and to keep from pitchpoling. In very light air downwind, racers will often stand out on the bow, holding on to the bridle wire to keep the sterns out of the water. Raising the windward rudder downwind is a common practice.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats * Nacra 5.2 References External links *Official support webpage Category:Catamarans Category:Dinghies Category:1980s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts ","title":"Hobie 17"},{"id":"61866811","title":"Swimming at the 2001 World Aquatics Championships ‚Äì Women's 100 metre freestyle"},{"id":"61866818","text":"Fatima Aziz (born 1969) is an Afghan physician and politician.

Sir John Denham had taken possession of the castle for the Royalists in mid-November, but after the Royalists had been turned back from London at the Battle of Turnham Green, a Parliamentarian force under the command of Sir William Waller approached the castle. After Denham refused to surrender, Waller's forces successfully stormed the castle. They captured it in under three hours, mostly due to the unwillingness of the Royalist troops to fight. This allowed the Parliamentarians to get close enough to breach the gates, after which the garrison surrendered. Background Farnham Castle, near the town of Farnham in Surrey, is a twelfth-century castle which was the home to the Bishop of Winchester, Walter Curle. At the outbreak of the civil war, most of the area around Farnham favoured the Royalists. In August 1642, King Charles I raised his royal standard in Nottingham and declared the Earl of Essex, and by extension Parliament, to be traitors, marking the start of the First English Civil War. That action had been the culmination of religious, fiscal and legislative tensions going back over fifty years. Both sides attempted to recruit the existing militia and new men into their armies.The Breakdown of 1641‚Äì2. On 8 September, George Wither was given a commission as captain of a cavalry troop raised in Surrey. Just over a month later, on 14 October, with the addition of two squadrons described by the historian Stephen Manganiello as \\"weak, poorly-armed squadrons of volunteer horse with but 60 muskets between them\\", he occupied Farnham Castle. Wither repeatedly requested additional troops and weapons to hold the castle, but when the Royalist army approached London in November 1642, after the Battle of Edgehill, Farnham Castle was considered of no strategic value, and Wither was ordered to abandon the castle. On the night of 8 November he evacuated his men and what ammunition he could, and Royalist forces under Sir John Denham took possession of the castle the next day. Denham had been appointed the High Sheriff of Surrey earlier that year by the King, and had also been issued with a commission of array, a medieval device for levying soldiers which had not been used since 1557. Denham's forces subsequently ransacked Wither's estate, ejecting his wife and children. Wither himself had been sent with his troop to Kingston upon Thames, and they subsequently fought in the Battle of Turnham Green on 13 November. Prelude Sir William Waller was tasked with clearing the south east of England of Royalist forces. The Royalist army was turned back from London after the stand-off at Turnham Green; the King retreated to Oxford, leaving a garrison at Reading.The Advance on London. With London no longer threatened by the King's large army, the commander of Parliament's army, the Earl of Essex, wanted to clear the Royalists out of the south east of England completely. Command of the operation was given to Sir William Waller, a Member of Parliament and experienced soldier, who had rapidly gained seniority within the Parliamentarian army. Most Royalist forces in the area withdrew to Reading or Oxford, but Denham remained at Farnham Castle. In his biography of Denham, Brendan O Hehir drew a parallel between Denham's experience and Wither's, saying that each had experienced \\"isolation amidst a rising enemy tide\\". Farnham Castle was not easily defensible, and Denham's troops reinforced the gate, barricading it with piles of wood. Battle On 30 November, the Parliamentarian force commanded by Waller, which comprised cavalry and dragoons, approached the castle and demanded its surrender. Denham refused, as the Parliamentarians had not brought any artillery with which to bombard the castle. The Royalists were well stocked; as well as plentiful weapons and ammunition, they also had 300 sheep, 100 oxen and plenty of other food. The inexperienced Royalist soldiers shied away from fighting, unwilling to show themselves on the castle walls and hiding behind the castle's defences instead. After three hours of fighting, in the absence of substantial defensive musket-fire, Waller's troops were able to get close enough to attach a petard to the gate. Despite the meagre defence, Colonel Anthony Fane, one of the Parliamentarian officers, was shot in the cheek, and died from the wound at his home in Kingston shortly thereafter. According to Elliot Warburton, in his 19th century history, Memoir of Prince Rupert and the Cavaliers, Fane was \\"almost the only person slain\\". Once the Parliamentarians had destroyed the gate, they were still unable to gain entrance to the castle because of the wooden barricade; however, the garrison surrendered after they had broken through and entered the keep. The Royalist courtier, Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon was disdainful of the efforts of Denham and his men, writing in his history of the war that they \\"were taken with less resistance than was fit,\\" and \\"deserved not the name of a garrison.\\" Aftermath Denham and his men were taken prisoner and sent to London, where they arrived on 3 December. The common men were quickly released, but others were held for longer at Lambeth House. It is unclear exactly when Denham was released, but it was before 23 March 1643. After gaining his freedom, he joined the King in Oxford. He soon after petitioned to Charles I on behalf of Wither, who had been captured, brought to Oxford, and faced the death penalty for fighting against the King. Denham pled to the King to spare Wither, as \\"while Wither lives, Denham will not be the worst poet in England.\\" Wither was given a reprieve, but after his release, he seized Denham's estate with Parliament's permission in an effort to offset his financial losses during the war. Denham retired from military life, and is best remembered as a poet; he published an array of propaganda for the Royalists during the war. Waller captured over ¬£40,000 worth of plunder, along with gunpowder and shoes. He subsequently captured Winchester, Arundel and Chichester, and within one month, he had asserted Parliamentarian dominance over Surrey, Sussex and most of Hampshire. His successes saw him appointed as Major-General of the West the following spring, and he was sent by Essex to attempt to claim the south west of England for Parliament. Farnham Castle was subsequently used by Waller as his base of operations; after the war it was slighted by Parliament.

A student of Giovanni Getto, he received his baccalaureate from the University of Turin in 1974 with an undergraduate thesis on Gabriele D'Annunzio. From 1975 to 1981 he was Assistant to the Chair of Italian Literature, a post held by Getto. From 1982 to 1999 he was a research fellow and lecturer; from 1999 to the present he has held the position of Full Professor and Chair of Italian Literature at the University of Turin‚Äôs Atheneum. Ficara was co-director of Nuovi Argomenti (1989-1999) and literary critic for Panorama (1988 ‚Äì 1997) and La Stampa (1978 - 2012). He currently collaborates with the Sunday edition of Il Sole 24 Ore and is co-director of Lettere italiane, a journal founded by Vittore Branca and Giovanni Getto. He is a corresponding member of the Lorenzo Valla Foundation and the Bembo Foundation. He is director of the De Sanctis Foundation of Rome and president of the De Sanctis Prize for Essay Writing. Ficara has been a visiting professor in the United States at UCLA, Stanford University, the University of Chicago and at Columbia University. He has also taught in Paris at the Sorbonne and at the Coll√®ge de France, as well as in various European universities. Literary critic, historian of literature and of literary-philosophical systems, and comparatist, his areas of study are Francesco Petrarca, Giacomo Leopardi, Giacomo Casanova and eighteenth-century European literature, Alessandro Manzoni, and twentieth-century Italian literature, with a particular interest in Montale and the question of the novel‚Äôs origins. His literary criticism merges non-fiction and textual criticism in order to elucidate the hermeneutics of the literary work: ‚ÄúWhy is criticism always less an explanation of and commentary on the text and more an alternative to a text that does not exist? Or rather: why is criticism itself no longer necessary for a work that explains everything on its own? [...] Contingent upon the writer‚Äôs ‚Äòoriginal' prose, the critic‚Äôs applied prose exists, in effect, because the other text exists even more.‚ÄùStile Novecento, Venice, Marsilio, 2007, pp. 218-219 \\"Ficara is one of those scholars who believes that (and attempts to put into practice) the writer‚Äôs contribution should not be viewed as secondary with respect to the professional contribution of the critic. Writing is a different means of speaking about literature, a more free, or more vertiginous or concise means to say the same things as the critic. [...] Ficara, who has set out on this particular path, is quite adept at concocting these mixtures of narration and interpretation, these moments and flashes in which we don‚Äôt know whether the narrator or the critic will prevail\\" (Gian Luigi Beccaria, Stile Novecento: il romanzo delle idee, \\"Tuttolibri-La Stampa\\", 16 June 2007, p. 5). \\"For Ficara what matters is the struggle, leading to an exchange of position, between narrative play and the awakening of the conscience: 'pure play in Laurence Sterne', 'play that yields to awareness in Alessandro Manzoni', 'dream-play of the conscience in Italo Calvino'. Fiction exists in the service of truth and truth does not exist without storytelling and without a 'crossroads of perspectives.‚Äô\\" (Alfonso Berardinelli, Il Novecento davanti a noi, Il Sole 24 Ore, 13 January 2008, p. 37).

The novel follows the story of a young Jewish immigrant living in New York who wishes to marry a wealthy man and escape the bounds of her lower-class upbringing. Yezierska drew inspiration for the novel from the lives of Rose Pastor Stokes and her husband J. G. Phelps Stokes, as well as her own relationship with John Dewey. The novel was published by Boni & Liveright, and it was adapted into a film of the same name in 1925.  Synopsis  The novel's main character, Sonya Vrunsky, is the daughter of Russian-Jewish immigrants living in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. At the beginning of the novel, Sonya is working as a journalist at a local Jewish newspaper, however she yearns to escape the lower-class world of the immigrant community. She sets her sights on marrying a wealthy, Christian man, named John Manning, who lives in the much wealthier and upper-class Upper East Side of Manhattan. Sonya uses her ethnic background as a Russian Jew to portray herself as exotic and exciting, which ends up being, as she had hoped, appealing to John. Eventually, Sonya and John become married. Once married, however, Sonya soon realizes that the kind of life that she had desires for so long is not what she initially thought it would be like. Sonya leaves John, and by the end of the novel, Sonya has found a successful career as a fashion designer and has married a fellow designer whom she truly loves.  Reception  When first published, Salome of the Tenements received a wide variety of reviews. Some praised Yezierska's writing style and admired how the novel depicted immigrant communities that were often under-represented in literature. On the other hand, many critics found Sonya's attempt to pull herself up out of poverty by marrying a rich man to be both shocking and off- putting.

Newsome runs a Twitter account and blog, using the name Hood Naturalist, to communicate science, advocate for environmental equality and promote diversity in biology and other scientific careers. The nickname \\"Hood Naturalist\\" reflects her upbringing in an urban environment, and is an attempt to counter the assumption that all naturalists grow up in rural or wilderness areas. Her research and science outreach efforts have been featured in a number of podcasts and radio shows, such as NPR's Short Wave and Science Friday, and was cast in the 2017 environmental documentary film Behold the Earth. In April 2019, Newsome was part of a team of women who criticised Discovery's response to science through song. Their response was a lip-synced music video set to \\"Let Me Blow Ya Mind\\", and portrayed a diverse bunch of women doing science, demonstrating that science is for everyone. Later in April 2019, Newsome released a rap music video, \\"Anything For The Count\\", a remix of \\"Clout\\" by rapper Offset. The video demonstrated her love for birding and why it is important to study and protect birds. In 2020, to respond to a series of events including the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed Black man who was shot while running nearby Newsome's field site in southern Georgia and the racism faced by Black birder Christian Cooper in Central Park, Newsome and Earyn McGee co-organised Black Birders Week, a weeklong series celebrating Black birders and Black nature enthusiasts on social media.

Her work at the institute involved the design of synthetic oligonucleotides and, separately, the use of oligopeptide frequency data to classify proteins. Later career and research When Makarova's husband moved to the US to work with Eugene Koonin in the National Center for Biotechnology Information, Koonin found Makarova a position as research fellow at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, studying Deinococcus radiodurans, a bacterium that can survive highly extreme conditions. In 2001, Koonin hired Makarova to join him at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. At the center, beginning in 2006, Makarova and her co-workers investigated the CRISPR-Cas9 system and its biological function as a bacterial immune system.

The building was constructed in 1903 and was in danger of collapse in 2012 when fund raising was commenced to complete structural repairs. History The modern city of Gherla was founded by the Armenian community in 1700 with the approval bought from Vienna, with the consent of Emperor Leopold I. In the beginning the Jews were only permitted to live in the small villages surrounding the actual city. One of the villages, Iclod, even as early as 1772 had a large Jewish population, with a house of prayer and a cemetery. Many of the Jews who lived in Iclod went to work every day in Gherla. During the 1830s, the first Jews settled in Gherla. Initially they were only allowed to settle in one suburb, Candia, but after a while they were expelled. Only after the 1848 revolution were the Jews allowed to live in the city of Gherla proper. The congregation was established in the 1850s by which time the restrictions on settlement of Jews in town has been rescinded. The community grew at a gradual pace. By 1860s the congregation already had a kosher butcher, a synagogue and a mikvah (ritual bath). The cemetery was opened in the 1870, until then, the burials took place in the Jewish cemetery of Iclod. Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef ha-Kohen became the first official chief rabbi of Gherla's Jewish community in 1880, acting as the spiritual leader, religious instructor, and even shochet (kosher slaughterer) of the community, and under his guidance many religious institutions were set up. He served until his death in 1920. Following the death of Rabbi ha-Kohen, his son-in-law, Rabbi Avraham Shlomo Elias became the rabbi of Gherla. After his death in 1930, his son Jakov Samuel Elias took over the spiritual leadership of the congregation In 1944 he was deported with the rest of the Jewish population and died in a camp near Auschwitz in 1945. The Jews of Gherla worked in various branches of industry and trade; several factories were owned by Jews. The largest of these was the distillery founded by Jakov Dov Feldmann, who employed many Jewish workers. At the turn of the twentieth century, Feldmann was the congregation's president. By 1903 there were multiple small synagogues operating in the city. That year, a large and elaborate synagogue was built to accommodate the increasing Jewish population. Religious life flourished, especially thanks to the construction of the new synagogue, the improving Jewish educational system, and the formation of a society which met at the synagogue to study the Talmud. Around this time a number of rabbis moved to the city, notable among them the Hassidic rabbi Baruch Rubin, and small religious schools popped up in individual homes, leading to the establishment of a larger \\"Talmud Torah\\" school in 1922, which housed an elementary school. Other institutions formed as well, such as the Chevra Kadisha (burial society), several organizations which helped take care of the needy members of the community, and even a kind of a guest house for the poorer visitors in the city. A modern mikveh (ritual bath) facility was constructed on the banks of the Somes canal and inaugurated in 1925. By 1930, census figures show that there were 1037 Jews in Gherla. The presidents of the congregation between the two world wars were Samuel Teleki, a landowner and distiller; Simcha Klein, a landowner; and Albert Fischer, a furniture factory owner. During this period of thriving Jewish life, the Zionist movement which was sweeping through Transylvania attracted some followers in Gherla, and precipitated some meetings and events. The first Zionist organization in Gherla was established in 1919. The various Zionist youth groups, such as the Aviva and Barissia, as well as Betar, were launched during the 1920s. The Zionist women were gathered in the WIZO (Women's International Zionist Organization). The non-Zionist Agudath Yisrael also had a local chapter. However, because the Jews of Gherla were Orthodox and at the time Zionism was shunned by the majority of traditional Jews, most of the community was less receptive or even openly hostile to Zionist ideology, and the movement did not gain as wide a following or as vibrant a cultural life as it did in some other Transylvanian cities. Nevertheless, some Zionists managed to reach leadership positions in the congregation. The highest point was reached by Albert Fischer who was also the congregation's president. With the coming of World War II, and specifically the partition of Transylvania on August 28, 1940, everything changed. Gherla along with the rest of northern Transylvania became part of Hungary. The Hungarian government began to make life difficult for the Jews with anti-Semitic laws such as those that prohibited Jews from attending university or having government jobs. Starting in 1942, Gherla became the headquarters of a labor service drafting board. In June 1942, the board conscripted 424 Jews for labor service from Cluj, Gherla and surroundings. The draftees were assigned to labor service battalions and sent to the Eastern Front in Ukraine where most of them perished. Those that survived and returned were subsequently sent to Dachau where a large majority perished. In 1943 and 1944 more Jews from Gherla were conscripted to labor service, but the majority of them were deployed within Hungary, most of these labor servicemen survived. Of note are the actions of Imre Revicky, a colonel in the Hungarian army, who tried to deal more compassionately with the Jews. Despite Revicky's job overseeing Jewish labor; he punished his subordinates for beating the workers, risking his own life repeatedly and saving the lives of hundreds of Jews in this way. He is a righteous among nations at Yad Vashem. Following the beginning of Germany's occupation of Hungary, on March 19, 1944, the Jews of Gherla were subjected to the Nazi's Final Solution program. Marked with yellow stars and expropriated, the Jews were forced into the local brickyard ghetto on May 3, 1944. On the same night, the Jews who lived in villages in the Gherla and Chiochis districts were also taken to this ghetto where 1600 Jews were crammed. The ghettoization was carried out under the immediate command of Mayor Lajos Tamasi, Police Chief Erno Bereczki and Police Chief Inspector Andor Ivanyi. On April 26, all of them had taken part in a secret conference chaired by Laszlo Endre, Hungary's State Secretary in the Ministry of the Interior. On May 18, 1944, the population of the ghetto of Gherla was loaded onto cattle car trains and transferred to the ghetto of Cluj. They were all deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau in the transport of May 25, where the overwhelming majority was killed in gas chambers or died later due to the harsh conditions. A single exempted Jewish family, consisting of the First World War disabled veteran Hillel Pataki, his wife and his unmarried son, were allowed to remain in Gherla, but they were on house arrest, could not leave the house without permission and they had to wear a white armband for identification. The family succeeded in saving most of the synagogue's Torah scrolls. When the war ended, only about 40 Jews returned home and they reestablished the community. A shelter and communal kitchen, which initially was supported by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, was able to provide meals every day for desperate refugees. In 1945, the survivors renovated the synagogue, which had been used as a warehouse for confiscated Jewish owned property. The Hassidic Rabbi Rubin's son-in-law, Mozes Frischman, was among the survivor's and he became the congregation's postwar rabbi. By 1947, following an influx of displaced refugees, 210 Jews lived in the city. After the formation of the State of Israel, many started to immigrate to the new Jewish homeland. By 1956, the congregation had 140 members and by 1966 the membership had declined to 21. In 1971 there were only 4 Jewish families in the city. By 2002, there was only one observant Jew, Zoltan Blum a Holocaust survivor, who was named honorary citizen of Gherla in June 2015. Mr. Blum is still being solicited by school children and various organizations to talk about his Holocaust experience. Since 2008, many of the former Jewish residents of Gherla who now live in Israel, United States, Canada and Australia have been actively trying to find some creative solutions to saving the beautiful synagogue of Gherla which has been neglected for decades. They formed an organization, ‚ÄúThe Jewish Community of Gherla‚Äù with members from all over the world. Mr. Alexandru Sommer, a resident of Gherla, of Jewish descent, whose grandmother perished at Auschwitz is the president and is actively involved in maintaining and providing access and safekeeping the Jewish Cemetery and the Synagogue. In the spring of 2016, the organization raised enough funds to build a Holocaust Memorial Monument on the grounds of the synagogue. In addition to being a memorial to the 1600 Jews that were deported from the Gherla ghetto, and memorializing the names of the 1040 known victims, the monument is also intended to raise awareness about the fate of the synagogue and be a catalyst for fundraising efforts to repair the Gherla Synagogue.Randolph Braham, The Geographical Encyclopedia of the Holocaust in Hungary, Northwester University Press, Evanston, Ill, 2013Michael Bar-On, Benjamin Herskovits, Sefer Zikaron Szamosujvar(Gherla)-Iklod-es Kornyeke, Publisher Irgun Yots, Tel Aviv, 1971 References Category:Synagogues in Romania Category:Synagogues completed in 1903 Category:Buildings and structures in Cluj County ","title":"Gherla Synagogue"},{"id":"61867106","text":"Lucia Borgonzoni (born September 18, 1976) is an Italian politician and member of the Senate of Italy.

He was father to Paul Revere, the famous American silversmith and patriot. Biography Rivoire was born in Riocaud, France, and on November 21, 1715, emigrated to his uncle Simon's house on the Isle of Guernsey. This was recorded in a family bible: \\"Apollos Rivoire, or son, was born the thirtieth of November, 1702, about ten o'clock at Night and was baptized at Riancaud, France, Apollos Rivoire, my brother was his Godfather and Anne Maulmon my sister-in-law his Godmother. He set out for Guernsey the 21st of November, 1715.\\" While there he was apprenticed to his uncle, who soon afterwards sent the boy to Boston with instructions to his correspondents to have him learn the goldsmith's trade. Rivoire arrived in Boston about 1715 and was apprenticed about 1720 to John Coney. By the time Coney died in 1722, he had anglicized his name to Paul Rivoire. After Coney's death, Rivoire bought his freedom for about ¬£40; the estate's inventory records \\"Paul Rivoire's Time abt Three Year & half as pr indenture ¬£30/0/0,\\" with an additional record reading \\"Cash received for Paul Rivoire's Time, more than it was prized at, ¬£10.\\" In 1723 he briefly revisited Guernsey, but returned to Boston and established himself as a gold and silversmith. At that time, his family name was variously spelled, \\"Reverie\\" and \\"Revear\\" being common. He married Deborah Hitchbourn on June 19, 1729, and with her ultimately had 12 children, of whom Paul Revere was the third. He advertised his shop location in The Boston Weekly News- Letter, May 21, 1730: \\"Paul Revere, Goldsmith is removed from Capt. Pitts at the Town Dock to North End over against Col.

A. californiense is generally distributed around the world and it is frequently found on dung and in soil near the entrances of animal burrows.  History and taxonomy  As one of the first species selected in the genus Auxarthron, A. californiense was first isolated from pack rat dung in 1963, at California. The genus Auxarthron was erected by Orr and Kuehn to accommodate species with swollen septa of the peridial hyphae, formerly classified in genus of Gymnoascus. However, both Apinis(1964) did not accept this new genus, because they could also observe swollen septa in other species of Gymnoascus. Although this feature may not be significant for distinguishing new genera, the genus Auxarthron could also be identified on the basis of the presence of wall thickenings in the vicinity of septa which they called \\"knuckle joints\\". The genus Auxarthron is related to Amauroascus and Arachnotheca, but differs from these two genera in possessing dark ascomata with distinct appendages. In 1965, this taxon was examined on cellophane buried in calcareous fen soil and on bird dung.  Growth and morphology  Colonies grown at freezing agar are at first white, then yellow, tan to yellow-brown and granular. then the colonies turn powdery. Colonies grow slowly on YpSs agar and become umbonate in center. The color of the colonies are often brownish and the reverse is reddish-brown in center to yellowish at the margins. This restricted, granular appearance with a reddish-brown reverse colony makes it distinguished from other species in the genus. Cylindrical or oblong conidia are produced in asexual reproduction. Conidia are pale yellow-orange, smooth to slightly rugose. Both intercalary and apical conidia were observed.  Appearance  Ascomata of A. californiense are globose. Young ascomata are rosy, and turn orange-brown at maturity. Ascospores are oblate and they have a pale yellow- brown color. This punctate ascospores appears broadly around the colony, forming a reticulate structure. The peridial hyphae of A. californiense also have a pale orange-brown color. These septate peridial hyphae are asperulate and cuticularized. A loose network appears with all the peridial hyphae together. A. californiense have uncinate appendages. Different from other species in the genus, the appendages of A. californiense are arise at odd angles from the ascocarps. In other species, the appendages are projecting forth at right angles. A. californiense is similar to Uncinocarpus uncinatus, in having thick-walled appendages that are hooked at the tip. However, the crozier-shaped tips of A. californiense have an acute end while the tips of U. uncinatus have a blunt and parallel end.  Habitat and ecology  Auxarthron species, like most Onygenaceae, have usually been isolated from strongly anthropized soil, enriched with human or animal keratinaceous remnants. The genus Auxarthron is considered as keratinolytic on the basis of hair perforation studies. However, the keratin degradative ability was not found in the specie A. californiense, different from other species in the genus. By Phylogenetic studies, this absence of keratinolytic ability shows that during the course of evolution the keratinolytic ability of Auxarthron genus is decreasing. In 1998, A. californiense was isolated on the veil, tunic and wood fragments on the remains of a ninth century Longobard abbess at Pavia, Italy. The presence of A. californiense in this habitat indicates that A. californiense might be able to utilize some of the nutrients in human decomposing substances.

Life and activism  Craggs was born Helen Millar Craggs in Westminster, London in 1888, daughter to Sir John Craggs, an accountant, who donate money for tropical medicine research, and she had seven siblings. Craggs was educated at Roedean and wished to study medicine, but her father refused that idea and Craggs went to teach science and physical exercise at her formed school for a time. Although Craggs' mother supported suffragism and was a lead committee member in the national and Kensington Conservative and Unionist Women's Franchise Association, she deplored activism. Craggs used a pseudonym 'Helen Millar' (perhaps to protect her family and her teaching post) when she joined the Women's Social and Political Union activists during the Peckham election in 1908. She was chalking pavements and handing out campaigning literature on the women's suffrage. Craggs assisted Flora Drummond with the aim of ousting Winston Churchill in the successful campaigning wiping out his majority on this and other equality themes during the election in Manchester. Churchill was then put forwards for the Dundee seat, where WSPU were ready to challenge him again Within two years, Craggs had to leave an unsympathetic home to become a full time WSPU organiser at 25 shillings per month, living in rented property in Bloomsbury. Craggs was joined at the Women's Press shop by Mary Richardson who spoke about the obscene abuse whispered by male 'bystanders' and others who came in to tear up the suffrage materials. The Museum of London has an image of Craggs on a horsedrawn carriage for distributing the Votes for Women newspaper. Craggs was close to Emmeline Pankhurst's son Harry, who suffered from polio, and visited his nursing home throughout and was with him when he died in January 1910. Craggs became organiser, after Grace Roe, at Brixton WSPU branch, and later at Hamstead. Within the movement, Craggs befriended Ethel Smyth, Evelyn Sharp and Beatrice Harradan. Craggs also spent time with Marie Newby in Devon influencing the campaign there. Craggs was also in Wales and identified as the protester who jumped out at the Home Secretary at Llandaff Cathedral during a Royal Visit at Cathays Park saying 'it was a shame he was going about the country while suffragettes where starving in prison' In November 1910, Craggs went to the Paragon Theatre, Whitechapel at 2a.m. to hide in the freezing roofspace overnight before Lloyd George was due to speak. Craggs broke through the crowd from her hideout shouting at the Chancellor about women's rights, and was thrown brutally down a stone staircase. A bystanding man who said 'women pay taxes too' was beaten. Cardiff University Archive has an image of Craggs from the Daily Sketch in 1912. In 1912, Craggs was imprisoned in Holloway Prison for smashing windows and went on hunger strike. Later Craggs was arrested for carrying materials for causing arson, near Nuneham Courtney, the home of Government Cabinet member, Lewis Harcourt. WSPU insisted Craggs was acting alone, as this was the first threat to property. The incident was described in detail in court about two women hiring a canoe, and surprise encounter with a policeman, to whom Craggs said they were camping nearby and had come to 'look around the house'. The constable later identified Craggs, but the second woman (Norah Smyth) escaped and police found food and WSPU flag colours (white green and purple) and phone numbers of the property and the Oxford Fire Station. Craggs wore ' a striking costume prominently displaying the suffragist colours' when she appeared in Bullingdon Petty Sessions court the next day and admitted her intent would not give her name. Craggs was held in remand due to the seriousness of the crime (as 8 people were in the house) and sentenced at the Assizes court in Oxford, bailed at ¬£1000, half was provided by Ethel Smyth. Craggs was sent for 9 months with hard labour in Oxford Prison, and wrote thanking Hugh Franklin for allegedly getting photographs of the property. Craggs was moved to Holloway Prison, again went on hunger strike and was force fed five times in two days and suffered internal and external brusing for 11 days then released due to her health. Lewis Harcourt gave ¬£1000 donation to the League for Opposing Women's Suffrage. Craggs moved to Dublin where she trained at the Rotunda Hospital as a midwife, married a London East End General practitioner, Duncan Alexander McCrombie, from Aberdeen. Her parents did not attend the wedding in 1914. Craggs trained as a pharmacist to support her husband's practice. Craggs was widowed in 1936, at a young age, starting in business making jigsaws as a means of earning income for her two children, Sarah (Sallie) (born in 1923) and John Alexander Somerville (born in 1925).  Later life  After World War II, Craggs and her daughter emigrated to North America, settling in Canada, and saw Christabel Pankhurst sometimes in Los Angeles Craggs returned to London became private secretary and then the second wife to Lord Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, a long-standing suffrage movement leader and sponsor from Surrey, three years after his first wife suffragette Emmeline had died, on St. Valentine's Day, 14 February 1957.

Afterwards, she found certain life experiences such as visiting a doctor difficult. She looked for help, typing ‚Äòrape, body image, can‚Äôt go to doctor‚Äô into Google search. Whilst working as a student nurse, she interviewed thirty women who had experienced sexual assault and discovered that she was not the only person who sometimes had difficulties. All the women told her it was hard to enjoy sexual intercourse, they had problems looking in the mirror and had issues with access to healthcare. For example, a woman told her that the person who assaulted her had said \\"If you relax it'll be over with quicker\\" and when a healthcare professional said the same words it brought back the original trauma. Amara founded the My Body Back Project in London in August 2014, intending to set up a website and create a support network for survivors of sexual assault. One year later, the project began a clinic at St Bart's Hospital in London dedicated to survivors of sexual assault. The clinic was set up as a result of asking women what they wanted and its success meant that the idea was quickly proposed to make it a nationwide service. Recognition Theresa May, at the time Prime Minister, wrote to Amara that ‚ÄúThrough sheer determination you have established the UK‚Äôs first sexual health and maternity clinic for women who have experienced sexual violence. The success of the ‚ÄòMy Body Back Project‚Äô is testament to your extraordinary dedication to supporting vulnerable women and you should feel proud of everything the project has achieved.‚Äù Amara was listed as one of the ten \\"brightest and best\\" feminists by The Independent newspaper in 2015.

There are two named segments, from San Jos√© to Santa Ana the name is , and from Santa Ana to Caldera the name is (Jos√© Mar√≠a Castro Madriz National Road), also known as (San Jos√©-Caldera Highway), Description The design of the route dates from 1978, due to financial, political and bad management, it was opened thirty-two years later, in several segments since 2005. The route begins next to the National Gymnasium in Mata Redonda district of San Jos√© canton, and continues west with four lanes, two in each direction, then from the loop road Route 39 to the toll booths in Escaz√∫ there are six lanes, three in each direction. Afterward, until Ciudad Col√≥n there are four lanes, two in each direction, then only two lanes, one in each direction until the junction with Route 23 at Caldera Port in Puntarenas. In San Jos√© province the route covers San Jos√© canton (Hospital, Mata Redonda districts), Escaz√∫ canton (San Rafael district), Santa Ana canton (Pozos, Uruca, Piedades, Brasil districts). In Alajuela province the route covers Alajuela canton (San Antonio, Gu√°cima, San Rafael, Turr√∫cares districts), Atenas canton (Jes√∫s, Concepci√≥n, Escobal districts), Orotina canton (Orotina, El Mastate, Hacienda Vieja, Coyolar, La Ceiba districts). In Puntarenas province the route covers Esparza canton (Caldera district). In the holidays, the route becomes mostly a single direction highway eastwards from Caldera to San Jos√© in advantage of the returning beach goers coming back to the Greater Metropolitan Area. =Toll booths= There are four toll booths at San Rafael de Escaz√∫, San Rafael de Alajuela, Atenas and Orotina. History In 1973, the Jos√© Figueres Ferrer administration decided to relocate the main Pacific port from Puntarenas to Caldera bay, making it evident that with a new highway connecting Ciudad Col√≥n with Orotina, the new port would be only 80 km from San Jos√©, just an hour away. In the mid-1970s, a preliminary design was drafted along the left (south) margin of the Virilla River (crossing towns such as El Rodeo, Piedras Negras and San Pablo de Turrubares) that seemed the most economical, passing through low-cost uncultivated lands. But over time the elected design was along the right (north) margin of the river (La Gu√°cima, Turr√∫cares, Concepci√≥n), which had more expensive lands for expropriation. The financial crisis in the early 1980s prevented further progress. However, in 1986 in the first government of √ìscar Arias (1986‚Äì1990), US$40 million was obtained from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to build the new road, although that administration finished without the loan being used. The same happened during the four-year period of Rafael √Ångel Calder√≥n Fournier (1990-1994). The opportunity didn't take advantage of those resources, and the IDB withdrew upon expiration of the loan period of use. The country uselessly paid US$3 million in interest. At the end of the 1990s, without available financing, private concession was considered, but it was necessary for the government to acquire more than half of the required lands, an opportunity that the owners took in their advantage to inflate the prices. Although they were reported to the Public Prosecutor's Office in 1997, it was considered that such abuse is not criminalized in the Criminal Code. In total, it took about twenty years to acquire the land for this work of public interest. Several major bridges were constructed in 1997 with US$25 million borrowed from Venezuela. They were completed and inaugurated in the administration of Miguel √Ångel Rodr√≠guez (1998‚Äì2002), and the road, which did not yet exist, was also inaugurated and named. The administration of Abel Pacheco (2002‚Äì2006) tendered the project by concession in 2004, and only one bid was received, from the Argentine company Jos√© Cartellone, which soon went bankrupt. The company tried to give the contract to Lavalin of Canada, but a year later withdrew claiming that the right of way was not yet available. When the second administration of √ìscar Arias (2006‚Äì2010) arrived, the concession was negotiated directly with the Spanish company Autopistas del Valle, a winner of the San Jos√©-San Ram√≥n highway since 2005, but it did not obtain immediate financing. Finally, a sister consortium of Autopistas del Valle, called Autopistas del Sol, was hired to build Ciudad Col√≥n-Orotina and also improve La Sabana-Ciudad Col√≥n and Orotina-Caldera, which was already built, and raised the cost to US$120 million. The company claimed that the road would cost 3 times more (US$370 million) than budgeted. The road infrastructure was mostly completed until almost five years after initial works, without penalizing the delay. Similarly, the same road designs were used more than 30 years ago, already obsolete by then, because changing them involved a larger budget in jobs and expropriations. The toll collection charged to the concessionaire began prematurely, with the route unfinished. Users were very critical of the amount to be paid and the location of the collection booths. In addition, the concessionaire managed to get the contract to include a guarantee of \\"minimum annual income\\", so that if the toll collected does not reach the expected amount, the government will have to pay the remainder. With such controversies and without having been completed in its entirety, the road officially opened on January 27, 2010, with an intense and continuous period of construction since January 9, 2008. Since then, the highway was delivered and managed by Autopistas del Sol with a public works concession contract (Law 7762 of Costa Rica) for its maintenance, for an extended period of 25 years. Together with the Constructora San Jos√©-Caldera, the concessionaire worked overtime to finish as soon as possible. In March 2014 Autopistas del Sol sold most of its shares to the Spanish company Globalv√≠a Infraestructuras S.A., with which the latter assumed control of the concession. To carry out the work, technologies such as hydro-demolition, rubblizing, the use of carbon fiber and the manufacture and extension of asphalts were implemented. On average, the trip to Caldera can be done in just over an hour, when it would take up to two hours by using Route 1. =Future widening= As the 1970s design proved to be obsolete upon opening due to having only one lane in each direction in most of the route, there have been plans to widen the design by adding and addendum to the concession contract, which is still in discussion as of September 2019 with plans to finish the required paperwork before the end of 2021.

The club fields both senior' and reserves' teams for men & women, and operates a junior academy under license from Football Federation Victoria. Although based primarily in Bulleen, the club trains at hosts home matches at various venues in Balwyn North, Kew, Kew East, and Wantirna to accommodate for the youth academy. The club was founded in February 2015 following the merger of Boroondara Eagles FC and Old Carey Grammarians SC, the most recent of three mergers of four original and two merged clubs that were all based in the inner-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, the earliest of which was founded in 1982. History The football club's earliest history dates back to 1982 with the founding of Italian backed club, Epping Eagles SC, later renamed as 'Eagles United' and finally 'Kew Eagles', the oldest of the four original clubs that would make up the present club. The second club, Doncaster Inter SC, also an Italian backed club was founded in 1986 as 'Intercity'. Eagles & Inter would never play against each other competitively as they were in different respective leagues, and would eventually merge in early 1994 to create the Templestowe Eagles SC, being the first of three mergers to occur.

The third original club of the present club would be Boroondara Lions SC, founded in 2003. It's five years of existence as a standalone club in seasons 2003-2007 saw the senior men's team finish mid table in the seventh tier league every season. The lions would never competitively face its future merger clubs, and eventually merged with Templestowe Eagles for the 2008 season to become the Boroondara Eagles. Despite optimism and established off-field stability, seasons 2008-2010 proved difficult for the revamped Eagles in seeing relegation twice down to tier six for the 2011 season which would later prove significant in the club's history. The last of the original clubs was to be Old Carey SC, founded in 2005 by alumni and parents of the Kew based independent school, Carey Baptist Grammar School, that would play out of their sports complex in Bulleen. After mixed results in 2005-2010, the senior men's team would find itself in tier six for 2011, the same league as its future merger partner.

It is classified as an exceptional forest ecosystem. Location The Lake Auger Old Forest Old Forest is in the unorganized territory of Lac-J√©r√¥me in Minganie Regional County Municipality of the C√¥te-Nord region. It lies to the west of Lake Auger. It is in the watershed of the Little Watshishou River. The forest covers a rugged area of , and is northwest of Havre-Saint-Pierre. The forest is administered by Quebec ªs Ministry of Natural Resources, Wildlife and Parks, Forest Environment Directorate. It was designated old-growth forest in 2005, and has IUCN management category III. A map of the ecological regions of Quebec shows the Lac Auger Old Forest in the east spruce/moss subdomain. Flora The Lac- Auger Old Forest mainly consists of stands of black spruce (Picea mariana) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea), or stands of black spruce alone, over 200 years old. The oldest trees are about 285 years old. The forest has not been seriously affected by fire, insect infestations or windstorms, and has never been modified by human activities. It has developed naturally, and has trees of varied ages from saplings to mature and senescent trees of great age, with much wood litter including the fallen trunks of large trees. The natural renewal process probably predates the oldest trees in the forest. Although old, the trees are relatively small due to the harsh climate, with few larger than in diameter or in height. The forest grows on medium or steep slopes covered with thin glacial till. There is also black spruce in sphagnum moss in damp areas, and white spruce (Picea glauca) on the richest sites, often at the foot of slopes along the many streams that criss-cross the area. There are some white birch (Betula papyrifera) in openings in the forest caused by windstorms. Fir and black spruce also dominate the undergrowth. The other undergrowth plants are not very diversified, and include hypnaceous mosses and common broad leaf plants such as Canadian bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), blue-bead lily (Clintonia borealis) and creeping snowberry (Gaultheria hispidula).

A small congregation of about 180 people, Smithton Community Church, hosted steady crowds for three years resulting in over 250,000 visitors. History The revival began in March 1996 when Pastor Steve Gray, the pastor of Smithton Community Church, was experiencing a personal crisis. Having pastored for 13 years in this small town, Gray was ready to quit due to discouragement over some aggressive, and possibly undeserved, criticism. The church was relatively successful for the town size, but Gray believed he had reached his limit of talent and emotional strength. The revival began during a Sunday night church service after Gray had spent two weeks away, mostly in solitude, but also attending some services at the Pensacola Revival in Brownsville, Florida, where he received some inspiration and hope. Upon entering the front door to the sanctuary, Gray felt electrified by the \\"lightnings of God\\" and began jumping up and down. The congregation reacted to the moment by taking off their shoes and going to the front of the church in celebration, seeing that their pastor was touched somehow. After the revival began, visitors began to attend the church from the local region, then people came from all 50 states, and eventually 50 other countries including Singapore, Australia, France, Germany, Israel, and Japan. The church ran six services per week and often had 600‚Äì1000 visitors. In 2000, the congregation moved to Kansas City. It is reported that at the church size was about 300 at that time and it is said 85 percent of the families made the move. Commenting on the reasons for the move, Pastors Steve and Kathy Gray felt \\"the town's 532 residents had grown weary of revival crowds that outnumbered the town's population and where recharged Christians and new believers found few ministry opportunities. However, a Christianity Today article \\"Smithton Revival: Revival's Relocation Pits Pastor Against Alienated Followers\\" reported...\\"Five and a half years after revival marked by twirling and jumping broke out in rural Missouri at the Smithton Community Church (SCC), its pastor and two- thirds of the congregation have relaunched their revival at the new World Revival Church (WRC) in the more populous Kansas City. But some members who stayed behind in Smithton feel disillusioned and are disturbed because they have lost their church. We wanted more of God, says Jerry Spencer, 56, a former lay leader of the defunct SCC. Unfortunately, we surrendered our lives to a movement and a man's revival. (OCTOBER 1, 2001) https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/october1/14.18.html \\" Kansas City provided an opportunity for people who wanted to join the congregation to find jobs and housing. Edith Blumhofer, director of Wheaton College's Institute for the Study of American Evangelicals, says the revival's relocation is surprising in its scale. \\"People who jump at a religious movement with enthusiasm do what it takes to be fully immersed in it,\\" she says. \\"But for a whole church body to move is unusual, especially from a rural to urban setting.\\" The congregation in Kansas City is called World Revival Church. Pastors Steve and Kathy Gray lead the church. The congregation is about 700‚Äì1000 members.

Whilst in Dunedin, Bernardelli published a study on the decline in intelligence in New Zealand school children. After extensive interviews, she determined that intelligence had declined 1.43 points in a generation. This was a lesser decline than had been detected in England, a finding which did not surprise Bernadelli, who explained: \\"on the one hand, differentials in family restriction are so far less pronounced in New Zealand, and selectiveness of migration, on the other hand, makes the hypothesis that New Zealand was able to start its recent history with a comparatively small quota of prolific, but dull, backward, and feeble-minded stock appear likely.\\" Bernardelli joined the Psychology Department of the University of Auckland as a Senior Lecturer in 1962, and led the behavioural science programme from 1976.

Scheer mentioned the name, in passing, in a phone conversation, saying \\"some of us up here have been kicking around Columbia.\\" Collins initially thought it was \\"a bit pompous\\" but the name eventually stuck as he could not think of a better alternative and his crewmates Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong had no objections. Collins was also influenced to accept the name because of its similarity to Columbiad, the name of the space gun in Jules Verne's 1865 science fiction novel From the Earth to the Moon, Following the mission and after a tour of U.S. cities, Columbia was given to the Smithsonian Institution in 1971. It was designated a \\"Milestone in Flight\\" and displayed prominently at National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., alongside the 1903 Wright Flyer.

She began her career in 2016, and in 2018 she played her first main role as Akari Amano in the anime television series Ms. Vampire who lives in my neighborhood.  Biography  Sasahara learned to play the piano at a young age and dreamed of becoming a singer during her elementary school years. She was persuaded against pursuing that career by her parents, who advised her that becoming one was difficult. While in junior high school, she played the clarinet as a member of her school's brass band. Around this time, she was encouraged to pursue a career in voice acting by her father, who told her that she could sing, act, and appear on TV in that line of work. Her father then encouraged her by printing out an audition form for a role in the Japanese dub of the film The Golden Compass, although she ultimately did not push through with auditioning. Nevertheless, as she had already been interested in anime and manga, the experience influenced her to investigate voice acting more and learn about anime production. During her third year of high school, Sasahara applied for enrollment at the Japan Narration Acting Institute. After passing the entrance examinations, she enrolled at the school while also going to university. While in her third year of training, she received a notification that the she had been accepted into the I'm Enterprise talent agency; she then debuted as a voice actress in 2016.

It is known as , between Route 1 in Puntarenas province and Monteverde. It is the main access road to the dairy farms and tourist-attraction rain forests of Monteverde. Description In Guanacaste province the route covers Abangares canton (Sierra district), Tilar√°n canton (Quebrada Grande, Cabeceras districts). In Puntarenas province the route covers Puntarenas canton (Guacimal, Monte Verde, Acapulco districts). History While it has historically been mostly a gravel road, there have been recent efforts to asphalt the road in its entirety due to its use by tourists. Work started in June 2017, with a projected end date of September 2018, to stabilize and widen some sections of the road. Work also began to pave the remaining 17-kilometer dirt and gravel section from Guacimal to Santa Elena. However, some of the residents have concerns about the effect of increased traffic and visitors on the area. By December 2018, the contractor Grupo Orosi had a 22% advance on the work, with a three-month delay after the original project end date. The contract was canceled due to the lack of progress and financial uncertainties of the contractor. There were also concerns by the National Laboratory of Materials and Structural Models (LANAMME) about the quality of the material in use. The last segment remains unpaved as of October 2019, while awaiting a new contract with a different company to continue the work, projected to start in May 2020.

Part of a worldwide network of Tibet Houses, Tibet House US focuses on the promotion and preservation of Tibetan culture through education on philosophy; cognitive or mind science based on the workings of mind and emotions; techniques of mediation and mental transformation; and contemporary and ancient arts and culture. These are presented to the public utilizing: * Lectures, classes and workshops on mind science, philosophy and meditation classes, with teachers from many traditions including the Dalai Lama, Deepak Chopra, and psychiatrists and meditation teachers such as Mark Epstein, Joe Loizzo and Sharon Salzberg. * A gallery that presents a rotating permanent collection and multiple exhibitions yearly of modern and ancient works from Buddhist cultures including Tibet, Mongolia, Korea, Japan and Russia. * Museum exhibitions, conferences, print publications and media productions including online courses, books, a biography of the Dalai Lama in graphic novel form and a quarterly magazine. * Lectures and events for the Tibetan community. * A traditional Tibetan shrine room. * A library of books and videos. * Online digital archives. * Tours to areas of Buddhist cultural influence. History In 1987, Columbia University professor and THUS President Robert Thurman, the first western Buddhist monk, actor and Chairman of the International Campaign for Tibet, Richard Gere, and modern composer and THUS Vice President Philip Glass, founded the organization, located in the Flatiron district of New York City. THUS' aim is to present and preserve Tibet's intangible culture heritage when it is threatened inside and outside Tibet, and give a contemporary understanding of the contributions of this minority culture, endangered by ever \\"more assimilationist policies, designed to absorb these minorities into the fold of one Chinese nation,\\" although The Constitution of the People's Republic of China \\"stipulates: \\"All ethnic groups in the People's Republic of China are equal. The state protects the lawful rights and interests of the ethnic minorities and upholds and develops a relationship of equality, unity and mutual assistance among all of China's ethnic groups. Discrimination against and oppression of any ethnic group are prohibited.\\" ...and they have the freedom to preserve or change their own folkways and customs.\\" Often working in cooperation with other educational and cultural institutions, THUS has sponsored teachings in New York by the Dalai Lama, and organized a three day conference in 2011, The Newark Peace Education Summit, that explored the policies and methods used by communities to establish peace. Participants included the Dalai Lama and fellow Nobel Laureates, anti-landmine activist Jody Williams, and Iranian civil rights activist Shirin Ebadi; Cory Booker, Martin Luther King III, economist Jeffrey Sachs, Deepak Chopra, Rabbi Michael Lerner; anthropologist Wade Davis, who shared a stage with representatives of the Navajo, Dene, and Hopi nations; and many other international and local activists. A Shrine for Tibet: The Alice S. Kandell Collection, \\"a visual knockout of a book\\" published by THUS, was the accompanying publication for the traveling exhibition In the Realm of the Buddha at the Smithsonian. THUS also serves as a meeting place for the local Tibetan and Tibetan Buddhist communities to hold programs and events. The Art of Freedom Award, honoring outstanding contributions reflecting THUS' mission, has been presented to author and human rights advocate Eliot Pattison, director Martin Scorsese, and artist Roy Lichtenstein, among others. Fundraising events include a yearly auction and dinner, and a benefit concert at Carnegie Hall organized by Phillip Glass that has featured Patty Smith, David Bowie, Laurie Anderson, Iggy Pop, Bj√∂rk, Debbie Harry, Gogol Bordello, FKA Twigs, and many other musicians over its thirty-plus years history. Collections THUS started the Repatriation Collection and the Old Tibet Photographic Archive in 1992. Containing over 3,000 objects and images from Tibet, these archives document the destruction of over 6000 monasteries, temples and historic buildings and the contents that were pillaged.Michael Carrington.

He belonged to a generation of communalist, indigenous thinkers in Mexico which included Floriberto D√≠az and Jaime Mart√≠nez Luna. His writings are influenced by anarchist ideas and call for the defense of the Chatino language and culture and for the autonomy of the Chatino land, which extends from the coast to the highlands of the Sierra in southeast Oaxaca.

So many words will germinate in this Chatino silence, that perhaps the forest will rise up again tomorrow.\\". Tom√°s Cruz Lorenzo was born on 21 December 1950 in San Juan Quiahije, Oaxaca, Mexico. He was born to one of the most traditional and marginalized Chatino communities in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico. He completed some schooling, but his professional training began at the age of 20 years old when he was a sacristan to his town's church, during the priesthood of Edmundo Avalos in Panixtlahuaca.

In 1981 he joined an organization called \\"Conasupo- Coplamar,\\" where he continued working until a few months before he was murdered. Conasupo-Coplamar's primary goal was community organizing, which they achieved by hiring a large number of community leaders. As a Conasupo supervisor, Tomas had to travel to all different towns and get to know the rest of the Chatino communities, which sharpened his political thinking. Despite his young age, elders were known to seek his advice. Tom√°s was 38-years-old when he was gunned down on the night of 26 September 1989, while he was waiting for the bus back to Oaxaca . A few days later the crime was reported to the First Forum for Indigenous Human Rights, which took place that year in Matias Romero, Oaxaca . 30 years later, his murder remains unsolved. Tom√°s like many other indigenous leaders was murdered during the tenure of Salinas de Gortari and Heladio Ramirez Lopez as president and governor subsequently . Political thought Cruz Lorenzo is considered an anarchist thinker, and his thought was influenced by the teachings of Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n, Kropotkin, and Pierre Clastres. He intended to pursue many research projects, but was unable due to his continuous activism and early death. His incomplete projects included studies of the changes in the notion of time among the Chatino people over a span of fifty years and methods for re- establishing traditional modes of social relations, as well as documenting his community's history and the violence and repression against the Chatino region. right Written work His quest for learning and understanding influenced him to write about the struggles within his community. He was a co- founder of the publication Nuevo Milenio, which served as a platform for documenting and drawing attention to the issues faced by the Chatino people. Some of his publications include, \\"De porqu√© las flores nunca se doblegan con el aguacero\\" (Why the Flowers Never Break in a Rainstorm), \\"Problemas forestales en tres comunidades Chatinas en 1977\\" (Problems related to the Forests in Three Chatino Communities in 1977), \\"Las sorpresas pol√≠ticas en Juquila\\" (Political Surprises in Juquila), and \\"Reflexiones de un amanecer en mi comunidad\\" (Reflections on a Dawn in my Community), among others.

Its first director was appointed in 1896, in the preceding years, the department was under the guidance of the Surveyor-General. Public works department in British colonial territories performed various functions, PWD carried out new constructions as stipulated in a budget as well as maintenance of government buildings, harbors, vehicles, sewage, water supply and equipment and furnishing connected to the projects. In addition, PWD provided technical advise to other departments in the colony. One of the early projects of the department was laying rail tracks from Lagos to Ibadan, in addition, it executed construction of motorable dirt and gravel roads, the first of which began construction in 1905 as a feeder to the railway. Between 1925 and 1926, PWD began developing a trunk road system in the colony and in 1926, metalling and tarring of the Lagos - Abeokuta road was in progress.  Branches  = Roads and bridges = The initial road projects began in 1906 as developments out of the railway as it was extended from Lagos to other locations north of the colony. Paths were cleared for road developments linking Ibadan to Oyo, Osogbo to Ilesha and Ede to Iwo. After the great war, a road linking Lagos to Ibadan was built, and between 1922 and 1923, a route linking to Ibadan with Benin through Ife, Ilesha and Akure was completed.and in the East a route to Onitsha from Enugu through Owerri was constructed. In 1926, PWD was responsible for 2,900 miles of motorable services, but those roads were built with minimum standards and many were only motorable during dry seasons. Other efforts of the department include the construction and management of a road bridge over River Challawa in Kano, the bridge was opened in 1928 having eight steel spans, a 150 feet span and remaining seven spans were 100 feet each. In addition, the 2,306 feet long Carter bridge, the first bridge linking Lagos Island with the mainland was opened in 1901 and managed by PWD. In 1926, a Central Roads Board sanctioned a programme to develop a road trunk system and feeders roads that are fit for modern vehicles, subsequently, designs were drawn to create a route connecting Lagos with Kano, and improve on the route linking Oshogbo, Benin and Asaba via Ilesha was also approved. Improvement were made to enlarge the Lagos to Abeokuta route and a route was created linking Abeokuta to Ijebu-Ode. Other new or improvement projects included Lokojo to Okene, Port Harcourt to Aba, Abakaliki to Ogoja, Jebba to Share, Zungeru-Bida, and Keffi to Nasarawa. Included in the new program were plans to replace wooden bridges with steel and iron. Trunk A roads linking major town and cities were handled by PWD and were later called federal roads, while the feeder roads were handled by native aiuthorities. = Waterworks = The department also managed major waterworks project and was directly involved in the provision of pipe borne water to communities in Lagos, Enugu, Kano, Kaduna and Jos. The first waterworks plant was built in Lagos; flow of water from Iju River was diverted into two settling tanks each capable of holding four million gallons before it was allowed to flow through sand filters and then pumped into an underground reservoir. In Enugu, the waterworks project used infiltration galleries to draw water from a spring before it is stored in a water reservoir. Other facilities managed by the division included Ogunpa Waterworks, Port Hasrcourt, Aba and Okenne waterworks. = Electricity = The department was the pioneer provider of electricity in Nigeria, the first project was in Lagos and electricity was primarily used for street lighting. The power was generated from generators that were coupled with alternators. The division expanded with the installation of the Iddo power plant. In 1946, electrical division was separated from PWD to form the Nigerian Government Electricity Undertaking. = Buildings = PWD had a building division that constructed and maintained houses for European and African staff, hospitals, post offices, and barracks for the police and Royal West African Frontier Force. The houses of European and African employees were built according to standards set by PWD and were numbered from Type 1 to Type 10. In 1931, the building branch began to develop a residential estate for African government staff in Yaba, Lagos, the construction of Yaba College of Technology, then known as Yaba Higher College began during this period. = Sawmill and workshops = The department managed a sawmill operation at Ijora, Lagos, obtaining softwoods, mahogany and hardwoods supplies from local sources and pitch pine from foreign sources. Product from the sawmill were used by the joinery furniture unit within the complex. The division also incorporated a training school for carpenters and built workshops in major cities of the country such as Enugu, Port Harcourt, and Kaduna. The workshops were equipped with woodworking machinery for manufacturing and maintenance. = Mechanical = The mechanical branch maintained departmental vehicles, moving equipment and mechanical equipment. = Stores = The stores branch under the leadership of a chief storekeeper was in charge of storage of valuable equipment and coordination of equipment use among other branches = Aerodromes = The branch was initiated in the mid 1930s when Imperial Air Mail Services desired regular services between Nigeria and United Kingdom.  Selected projects  *Massey Hospital *European Hospital at Enugu and Jos *Yaba Estate Development Scheme  Structure  PWD was headed by the director of Public Works, who was assisted by regional assistant directors manning three provinces. In the 1920s, three assistant directors where in charge of the Northern, Southern and Western areas and within each area were divisions and sub-divisions.  Sports club  Through the establishment of various sports and recreational facilities for black and white employees across the country, PWD and other government agencies with the werewhithall to fund such facilities contributed to the growth of football in Nigeria.

She is the former press secretary for rapid response at the Human Rights Campaign, an American LGBTQ civil rights organization.  Life and career  Clymer was raised in central Texas, after moving with her mother from Utah at a young age. She joined the United States Army in 2005, and later enrolled in the United States Military Academy. She served in the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard), based at Arlington National Cemetery, until 2012, when she was honorably discharged. After leaving the Army, she moved to Washington, D.C. and took a job as a visitor services representative at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. After working there for a year, she enrolled at Georgetown University and finished her bachelor's degree. In 2017, Clymer began working at the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBTQ advocacy group and political lobbying organization in the United States. In November 2017, she came out as a transgender woman. A Twitter thread about Kathryn Joosten's life by Clymer went viral. Clymer is an outspoken activist on issues including LGBTQ rights, feminism, and veterans' affairs. She has written articles for publications including Glamour, The Independent, NBC News, Vice, and The Huffington Post, and has appeared as a guest commentator on CBS News Sunday Morning. In 2018, staff and later a manager at the D.C. restaurant Cuba Libre demanded Clymer provide an ID prior to using the restroom, incorrectly saying she was legally required to; Clymer refused and provided a transcript of the D.C. Human Rights ActDistrict Requirements in Public Accommodations - Gender Identity and Expression, DC Office of Human Rights which makes it illegal for public accommodations to discriminate based on gender identity. Clymer was removed from the restaurant and police were contacted. The D.C. Attorney General fined Cuba Libre $7,000 for violating the aforementioned D.C. Human Rights Act and required the staff to undergo training in anti-discrimination practices; Cuba Libre later removed the two employees involved and denounced their conduct. The restaurant reached an out of court settlement with Clymer, and made a separate donation to LGBTQ homeless shelter Casa Ruby.  Awards and recognition  In 2020, Clymer was included in Fortune magazine's '40 Under 40' listing under the \\"Government and Politics\\" category.

Summary The club signed 1955-56 French league champion manager Luis Carniglia as its new head coach. New arrivals for the team were goalkeeper Rogelio Dom√≠nguez, a champion with Argentina at the 1957 Copa Am√©rica, and from Nacional de Montevideo Uruguayan defender Jos√© Emilio Santamar√≠a, who played at the 1954 FIFA World Cup and brought attention due to his style of play. These two signings were crucial to boost the defense of the team with an impressive 26 goals conceded during 30 matches in the Spanish league, helping also the offensive line wherein Alfredo Di Stefano and his 19 goals clinched another league top scorer trophy, this time tied with Manuel Badenes (Real Valladolid) and Ricardo Al√≥s (Valencia) . The team, with an excellent balance in defense and offense, won its sixth Spanish league title, finishing 3 points above Atletico Madrid despite a bad row of results during winter. Also, the squad clinched its third consecutive European Cup defeating A.C. Milan 3-2 after extra time at Heysel. In the Copa del General√≠simo, the squad reached another final, and were defeated this time by Athletic Bilbao 0-2.

He doesn't write or sing to formula.\\" Music & Musicians begins their review with, \\"Ending an eight-year absence, Kevin Welch‚Äôs new album shows us all over again why he‚Äôs regarded as an Americana icon.\\" David McGee of The Bluegrass Special includes this statement in his review of the album, \\"A Patch of Blue Sky is a wondrous thing, marked by impeccable songcraft, beautifully restrained and deeply evocative musicianship, heartfelt singing and meaningful stories.\\" Brian Baker of Country Standard Time concludes his review with, \\"The CD proves talent is genetic, with appearances from Welch's son Dustin and daughter Savannah (and her band, The Trishas), but most of all it is pure evidence of the timeless beauty and scuffed wisdom in Kevin Welch's songs.\\" The San Francisco Examiner reviews the album and writes, \\"A Patch of Blue Sky\\" ‚Äî featuring a now-adult Dustin on banjo and slide, plus daughter Savannahon on vocals ‚Äî is his first solo set in eight years.

His best-known designs include the Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk Order, the Czech circulating fifty-heller and the Czech circulating twenty-crown. He is also the author of the commemorative coin Nov√© Mƒõsto Pra≈æsk√© (Prague's New Town) from the set of Charles IV, which was awarded the Most Beautiful Gold Coin of the World (2001) at the turn of the millennium.  Biography  Vladim√≠r Oppl was born on 19 January 1953 in √öst√≠ nad Labem. After finishing the Ceramics High School in Bechynƒõ, he studied at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague under professors Jan Kavan and Josef Malejovsk√Ω. During that time he began to be interested in the medal design, namely after he won his first competition - he designed a commemorative medal for the Julius Fuƒç√≠k's 75th birth anniversary. After finishing his studies he worked for ten years as a lecturer at the Academy and as a sculptor. After the Velvet Revolution in 1989 he started working independently. At present he lives and works in Prague.  Works  Vladim√≠r Oppl regularly participates in contests for coin and medal design announced by the Czech National Bank, prepares proposals for the Czech Mint, the Prague Mint, the National Treasury and foreign clients. He seeks his motives almost exclusively in the Czech history. His best-known designs include the Czech circulation coin with a nominal value of 20 crowns (1993 model), a Czech 50-heller coin (1993 model), a platinum medal Church of Sts. Vitus weighing half a kilogram or a set of gold and silver medals Codex Gigas and gold coins Czech Crown with a nominal value of 1000, 2500 and 5000 CZK (1994). Among his most successful coin designs is the commemorative coin for the 650th anniversary of the founding of Prague's New Town by Charles IV. It was named the most beautiful gold coin for 1999 in the traditional competition organized by the US magazine for numismatics, \\"World Coin News\\" and the publisher \\"Krause Publications\\". In 1996 Oppl, the sculptor, re-recreated, together with Martin Ceplecha, the original Otakar ≈†paniel's lion emblem from 1962. In August 1997 the granite copy was fitted under the statue of Jan ≈Ωi≈æka at V√≠tkov National Monument. Vladim√≠r Oppl is also the author of the prestigious Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk Order in all classes. Since 2014, he has been working closely with the National Treasury, a distributor of commemorative coins and medals. Every year the Treasury publishes several of its own issues, the back and face of which are decorated with designs embossed according to Vladim√≠r Oppl. His designs are characterized by a unique, easily recognizable handwriting. What is typical for author's work are the fine elaborate details and an often complicated but easy to read composition. The medalist seeks inspiration for his filigree work in unusual areas, for example in embroidery on medieval fabrics of royal robes. In 2014 and 2015 the National Treasury issued two medals, designed by Vladim√≠r Oppl, stamped from 1 kg of pure silver. The first one was issued to commemorate the 670th anniversary of the founding of St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague. The second one paid tribute to the Father of the country - Charles IV, from whose imperial coronation 660 years have passed. Vladim√≠r Oppl's motifs also decorate many National Treasury collections. Among the most popular are, for example, the collection of the Greatest Personalities of the Czech Nation, Life of Charles IV. or the golden collection Magic Prague, which commemorates the well-known Prague myths and legends. In August 2017, the medalist work with the Czech National Bank (ƒåNB) to honor the upcoming centennial anniversary of the birth of the Czechoslovak republic. For the edition \\"Important personalities of the Czechoslovak state\\" (\\"V√Ωznamn√© osobnosti ƒçeskoslovensk√©ho st√°tu\\") he designed three different reverse sides for the jubilee circulating twenty crowns. They featured portraits of the three Czech and Slovak founders: Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk, Edvard Bene≈° and Milan Rastislav ≈†tef√°nik.

The purpose of the society is to promote interest in and the study of entomology in Norway and to establish contact between the interested parties. The society is open to both amateurs and experts. Anyone with an interest in insects or other arthropod groups can become a member. Local branches of the society are located in the largest Norwegian cities, and they organize excursions to particularly interesting sites and guides, who offer advice connected with identifying species and preparing collected material. History The society was founded by ten enthusiasts; none of them were entomologists by profession, but two were biologists. All of them shared an interest in insects. Thomas Georg M√ºnster originally came up with the initiative, and he served as the society's first chairman. The following year, two more members joined the society and it received its first charter. Work with butterflies and beetles occupied the society's members during its early years. Institutions were allowed to become members of the society in 1921, the first one being the Norwegian College of Agricultural in √Ös. in 1922 the society started admitting individual members from abroad. Membership of the society gradually grew, and in 1930 there were about 40 individual members. The society had about 400 members in 2008. The society is open to anyone that would like to be a member. This has not always been the case; previously, another member had to recommend individuals for membership in the society, and membership was approved after assessment by the board. For example, Arne Semb-Johansson became a member in 1939 at the recommendation of Fridthjof √òkland. In the process, he received a letter from Leif Reinhardt Natvig, stating: \\"Through Dr. √òkland I have been informed that you would like to become a member of the Norwegian Entomological Society. To that end, I am bound to obtain some information from you: date of birth, place of birth, position, and which insect group you collect or are especially interested in. I will then present the matter at the society's next board meeting. Yours, Leif Reinhardt Natvig.\\" Later Semb-Johansson received a second letter: \\"I have the honor to inform you that you have been admitted as a member of the Norwegian Entomological Society.\\" Surveying insects in Norway In order to be able to survey the prevalence of Norwegian insects, a simple geographical system for locating sightings was needed. In 1924, Thomas Georg M√ºnster and others created a system that divided Norway into bio- geographical sectional areas for botanists and zoologists using number codes. Eventually it turned out that this was little used. In 1943, Andreas Strand came up with a new system called Inndeling av Norge til bruk ved faunistiske oppgaver (Division of Norway for Use in Fauna Tasks), popularly known as the Strand System. In it, Norway was divided into 37 regions based on municipal and county boundaries, and it took into account that the fauna in the interior parts of the country differed from the fauna on the coast. Therefore, most Norwegian counties are divided into smaller areas (e.g., inner, outer, north, or south). Strand chose letter codes instead of numbers; for example, HOY is the code for outer Hordaland (Hordaland, ytre). The system was revised in 1981 by Karen Anna √òkland because the municipal boundaries had also been revised. This system is recommended by the society and is used in all publications. Since the 1960s, UTM coordinates have routinely been used for mapping species. Since 1978, the European Invertebrate Survey (EIS) system has been recommended. In this system, Europe is divided into squares of . In a separate limited system for Norway, the squares are adapted to the Norwegian map and numbered from 1 to 189. For example, Oslo is in the square designated EIS 28. This gives the Norwegian map a grid that is well suited for demarcating a species' distribution. In May 2008, the Norwegian Species Observation System (Artsobservasjoner) was launched; this is an internet-based service where sightings can be published. The Norwegian Entomological Society is one of five organizations working with the Norwegian Biodiversity Information Centre (Artsdatabanken) to operate the website. Journal and other publications There were no Norwegian entomological journals in the early years. The first publications by Norwegian entomologists appeared in the Swedish Entomologisk Tidskrift (Entomological Journal), which was not unexpected because Norway was in a union with Sweden. Other articles also appeared in series published by the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters and in Nyt Magazin for Naturvidenskaberne (New Journal for the Natural Sciences). This situation was not satisfactory, and the first issue of Norsk Entomologisk Tidsskrift (now Norwegian Journal of Entomology) appeared in May 1921. *Norwegian Journal of Entomology is the association's research journal, and it is sent to all members. It is issued twice a year. The journal has been published since 1921; it was originally called Norsk Entomologisk Tidsskrift and it has changed its name several times. Back issues are posted online and can be read at the Norwegian Entomological Society's website. *Catalogus Coleopterorum Daniae et Fennoscandiae (Register of Beetles of Denmark and Fennoscandia) inventoried beetles and was published in 1939. It was the first complete register of the distribution of a group of insects in Norway. *Atalanta norvegica (The Norwegian Atalanta) was published from 1967 to 1983, and it was a companion publication to the Norwegian Journal of Entomology. It was dedicated to the study of Norwegian butterflies. The journal is no longer published, but it can be read on the Norwegian Entomological Society's website. *Insekt-Nytt (Insect News) is written in a popular science style and is the society's members' magazine. It was first published in 1976, and it appears four times a year. It contains material on collection and preparation, literature on Norwegian insects, brief presentations of insects or insect groups, and new discoveries. Other arthropod groups such as arachnids are also covered in the magazine. Issues of the magazine over five years old can be read on the Norwegian Entomological Society's website. *Insecta norvegiae (Insects of Norway) is a journal that publishes major works such as individual volumes, checklists, bibliographies, and so on. It is published at iregular intervals. *Norske Insekttabeller (Norwegian Insect Tables) is a series of inexpensive Norwegian- language booklets with identification tables for smaller groups of Norway's insect fauna. All the booklets are available on the Norwegian Entomological Society's website. *Catalogus Lepidopterorum Norvegiae (Register of Norwegian Butterflies) appeared in 2002, and it is based on about 125,000 sightings of butterflies in Norway. Its information is available in a searchable database.

His work is largely within the documentary genre and has been broadcast by publishers such as Discovery, Inc., National Geographic, Seeker, YouTube, and OZY. To date, Addison has been to all seven continents with work in states such as Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Bolivia, East Timor, Benin, South Africa, Myanmar, Oman, Western Sahara, Vietnam, Togo, Brazil, and Mexico. Early life and education Addison was born on June 15th, 1979 in New York Hospital to his parents Patrick O'Dea (1938 - 2007) and Sara (n√©e Greenway) O'Dea. Raised as the eldest of three brothers in New York City, the family traveled internationally extensively for both personal and professional reasons. O'Dea initially attended the Buckley School, followed by Indian Mountain School and international baccalaureate for high-school at the Dwight School in Manhattan. He holds a BSc. from New York University. Work His work includes writing, directing, and producing film and television about subjects such as the origin of voodoo through West African Vodun in Togo and Benin; exploring ancient Quranic libraries in the Sahara; the principals of afterlife in Vietnamese Buddhism; and the relationship between cloistered cults, like Santa Muerte, and organized religion. His current projects include producing Eugene Jarecki's new scripted feature \\"Tuareg Project\\" (working title). It is an action film about a member of the Tuareg people native to the Sahara. He is also the writer and producer of a new documentary series called Beat Nation, currently in development with Ginedo Films, also produced by Nabil Elderkin and Mattia Bogianchino. = Discovery TRVLR = His largest project to date is writing and directing the thirty six episode series Discovery TRVLR for Discovery, Inc. and Google. Filmed on all seven continents, the series centers around a ‚ÄúGuru, Renegade, Entertainer or Explorer‚Äù in each environment as they pull the curtain back on varying rituals, unique traditions and life-threatening quests that encompass their culture.‚Äù At that time, Discovery TRVLR was Discovery's largest virtual reality project to date. The series was designed by O'Dea to go to as remote locations as possible and focus on the universality of the people who live there. Rather than sending a message of 'we are all the same' or forcing Western ideals on the characters, the idea is to create an elegant juxtaposition at a hyperlocal level. ‚ÄúDefying convention‚Äù in Communist Vietnam is significantly different when contrasted alongside the same idea in Catholic Mexico. From an interview with Addison in Filmmaker about the show: > ‚ÄúA core tenet of TRVLR is access, getting into closed communities that are > otherwise not open to visitors. Given how popular the travel genre is, you > have to work harder as a producer and director to seek out these communities > and earn their trust. That meant we were shooting in locations that required > negotiations for safe passage through gangland and armed security.‚Äù References External links *Official Website Cheddar interview Category:Living people Category:1979 births Category:People from New York City Category:American documentary filmmakers Category:American film directors Category:New York University alumni ","title":"Addison O'Dea"},{"id":"61869179","text":"The 2019‚Äì20 North Alabama Lions men's basketball team represented the University of North Alabama in the 2019‚Äì20 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.

Golf career Waltman started his career as an assistant professional Pretoria Country Club. He showed promise as a teenager and, at the age of 18, beat Bobby Locke in the first round of the 1957 South African Professional Match Play Championship. His victory was referred to as \\"one of the greatest surprises in South African golf for several years.\\" Waltman was an unknown teenager and Locke was considered one of the best golfers in the world and would go on to win the British Open four months later. Waltman won his first big tournament, the 1961 South African Open, by an extraordinary eight shots. Two years later he would win the event again by shot over colored golfer Sewsunker Sewgolum. In addition to these triumphs he won multiple other events on the South African circuit and the 1963 Dutch Open. Missionary work Waltman was considered a \\"potential superstar\\" but abruptly quit golf at the age of 25 after completing the 1964 Masters Tournament. Waltman stated, \\"I wanted a purpose for my life. I was devoting my whole life to a game. Being so involved in golf limited me. Man is his own biggest enemy.\\" The golf commentator Henry Longhurst elaborated, \\"Gradually the sheer materialism of this form of life and the unceasing emphasis on money began to sicken him, as it must have done so many before him. The difference was that he did not threaten to give it up. He just gave it up.\\" He became a Christian missionary. As of 2006, he was still a missionary.

A thirty-six year veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency, he best known (publicly) as their Director of Public Affairs in the 1980's as the CIA began to recraft their public image after finding it difficult to shed the reputation it gained in the mid-1970's as a rogue agency accused of shocking abuses of power. Previous to masterminding the public perception of the agency, Lauder was the Deputy Inspector General, the acting Chief of Latin American Division, and held a number of classified posts before then. Early life George Lauder was born in New York City to his parents Katherine Varick Lauder and Edwin Storrs Dewing. His parents divorced when he was very young and his mother gave her children her surname. Katherine Lauder was a member of the Lauder Greenway Family whose wealth allowed him to attend Andover, Yale for his undergraduate degree, and earn a law degree from the University of Virginia. Lauders college education was interrupted by the advent of World War II, when he joined the U.S. Navy as a lieutenant and was a navigator for seaplanes and aircraft carriers in the South Pacific. He would ultimately graduate from the class of 1945 in 1947 from Yale. CIA After graduating law school, Lauder joined the CIA in 1951. From 1951 until 1978 he was a covert operations officer posted in several countries. All these assignments and postings are still classified by the CIA. Due to a single unredacted internal document dated June 29th, 1977 (that was released as part of a FOIA request), Lauder is revealed to have been the Acting Chief, Latin American Division at that time. Given the date, Lauder was in charge of all CIA activities in Latin America during a portion of Operation Condor. = Report on Cuban Complicity in the Assassination of JFK = At the direction of E. Henry Knoche, Lauder, while with the Latin American Division, lead a team in a comprehensive investigation into Cuban complicity into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. From mid-October 1976 to June 1977, Lauder compiled a report that drew an extensive road map between a disgruntled La Cosa Nostra lead by Santo Trafficante trying to have Fidel Castro, Raul Castro, and Che Guevara assassinated instead. In one of the final nails in the coffin of JFK conspiracy theories, the report found no clear links between the Cuban government and the killing. Soon after this report was filed by Lauder, he left covert operations on an unconfirmed date to become the Deputy Inspector General for the CIA. =Director of Public Affairs= In 1981, there was a significant expansion of the CIA. Overseas operations had expanded, including covert actions intended to influence events in other countries, and President Reagan had given the agency authority to conduct operations within the United States. By 1983, the ramifications of this expansion were being felt and late that year, William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence, named Lauder the Director of Public Affairs. Over the course of his tenure, Lauder was the agencies public face to the United States amidst the end of the Cold War, the Nicaraguan Contras affair, Iran Contra, the 1985 Beirut car bombings, and other other seminal events in the history of the CIA. Lauder was also constantly sparring with journalists such as David Ignatius, Bob Woodward, and Jack Nelson. Lauders departure from the CIA in May 1987 coincided with the death of Casey and the start of congressional hearings on the Iran Contra scandal. Awards & Citations Over the course of his career, Lauder received the CIA's Distinguished Intelligence Medal and Medal of Merit. Family Lauder married Laurita Blatz on April 25th, 1952. They had four children together including daughters Frederica Lauder and Leigh Lauder and a son, George V. Lauder of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard.

Beginning with an eclectic training in natural sciences and urban planning Andrew became interested in statistical modelling of human behaviour, particularly in relation to major aspects of the life-course. After teaching in Wales and the USA and a postdoc in Cambridge he was appointed as statistician to the MRC Child Psychiatry Unit at the Maudsley hospital. Familiarisation with a range of statistical models led to a collaboration with Sophia Rabe-Hesketh in the development of a program and influential conceptual framework that integrated multilevel, structural equation and generalized linear models. With an intervening appointment in medical and social statistics at the University of Manchester he returned to King‚Äôs College London in 2010. His varied applied work has largely focussed on atypical behavioural and neurodevelopmental child development, particularly of children on the autism spectrum.

As a rare species of fruit fly endemic to Hawaii (‚Äúthe Big Island‚Äù), the fly often experiences reproductive isolation. Despite barriers in nature, D. silvestris is able to breed with D. heteroneura to create hybrid flies in the laboratory. Male D. silvestris demonstrate many elaborate courtship displays like wing waving and courtship songs to attract females to their territories. To defend these territories, males behave aggressively and fight with one another. This species demonstrates sexual selection through female choice, as indicated by an evolutionary enhancement of extra tibia bristles occurring in certain D. silvestris populations in the last 700,000 years.  Description  Island of Hawaii (the Big Island), USAKipuka encircled by lava flow in Hawaii D. silvestris has a large body, long legs, and slim wings. This fly has a round head shape, which is typical for fruit flies. While females have a completely dark yellow or orange face, males have a black face with a horizontal yellow stripe between the frons and the clypeus. The antennae are black in males and yellow in females. The lateral part of the mesothorax varies from brown to black pigmentation, and yellow pigmentation can be found on the edge of the top side in some individuals. Unlike females, males have two rows of long bristles along the upper sides of their forelegs. There is some variation in the number of male tibial bristles, as 20-30 extra bristles can be found in the middle of the two rows in north and east populations of Hawaii. These extra bristles create an irregular third row, which is related to the fly's courtship ritual and may have arisen due to geographic isolation from ancestral south and west populations. This species is tolerant to colder temperatures and vulnerable to heat stress due to higher temperatures, which affect sperm mobility and survival. This is consistent with the flies' preference for cooler environments found at higher elevations. There are three phylogenetically early chromosomal inversions in D. silvestris that are associated with elevation changes, possibly reflecting an adaptive shift to altitude that contributed to evolution in Hawaiian Drosophila.  Distribution and habitat  Currently there are about 1,000 Drosophila species native to the Hawaiian Islands, and, D. silvestris inhabits the Big Island. Extensive lava flow from volcanoes fragments the geographical distribution of this species around the island. The flow of lava creates kipukas, isolated habitable patches of vegetated land, which can range from several square meters to several square kilometers in size. D. silvestris inhabits high- altitude, cool rainforests on the slopes of all five volcanoes in Hawaii (Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa, Kilauea, Hualalai and Kohala), specifically in altitudes ranging from . The most ancestral populations of this fly species are found on Hualalai, the third youngest volcano on the island.  Evolution and taxonomy  Topographic map of volcanoes on the Island of HawaiiA quarter of the world's Drosophilidae species are endemic to the Hawaiian Islands evolving from an ancestral continental species which arrived 26 million years ago due to Hawaii's extremely diverse ecosystem and vegetation causing speciation. D. silvestris only inhabits the Island of Hawaii (the Big Island), which is 400,000 years old. D. silvestris is a member of the \\"picture-winged\\" group, which consists of 112 Hawaiian Drosophila species known for their unique light and dark wing patterns. This group consists of four subgroups; D. silvestris is a part of the planitibia, or idiomyia, subgroup, which is known for consisting of flies that produce courtship songs by vibrating their wings. D. silvestris and other recently evolved planitibia species emit less complicated and higher frequency courtship songs compared to this subgroup's more ancestral flies. D. heteroneura, another member of the plantibia subgroup, is a close relative of D. silvestris. Both of these fly species are native to Hawaii, and genetic similarities such as the sharing of a unique inversion in Chromosome 3 provide evidence that these fly species are derived from the same ancestral Hualalai population despite being morphologically distinct. The close evolutionary relationship between these two species is supported by a lack of this inversion in D. planitibia and D. differens, the more ancestral members of the planitibia subgroup. One of the most easily- visible differences between D. silvestris and D. heteroneura is in head shape: while D. silvestris heads are round, the D. heteroneura males have broad, hammer-shaped heads that reflect their head-butting fighting style. Polygenic inheritance may be responsible for this large between-species difference in male head morphology; it may have evolved to aid females in species-specific identification of mates. These species are mostly sympatric and broadly overlap in inhabiting geographic regions, though D. heteroneura prefers living in the understory of rainforests while D. silvestris typically selects areas of higher altitude. Field studies have shown males of both species sharing territories on a tree branch and females of both species laying eggs on the same host plant.Conant, P. (1978) Lek Behavior and Ecology of Two Sympatric Homosequential Hawaiian Drosophila: Drosophila heteroneura and Drosophila silvestris. M.Sc. Thesis, University of Hawaii. These two species can produce fertile hybrids in the laboratory despite exhibiting reproductive isolation in the wild due to prezygotic barriers like species-specific mating behavior patterns. Analysis of mtDNA restriction sites and phylogenies of males in Hawaiian fly populations found that D. silvestris with two rows of bristles have a closer genetic distance to D. heteroneura than D. silvestris with three rows of bristles. This close mtDNA lineage may be due to early hybridization between the two species in Hualalai or other areas in west Hawaii where the ancestral two-row population resides. West and east D. silvestris populations have distinct maternal lineages.  Territoriality and Mating  = Lekking = This species follows a lek mating arrangement where the female will observe potential mates and select based on the attractiveness of their courtship displays. Due to this mating system, female mate choice may play a significant role in the reproductive success of males. Males behave aggressively towards one another by shoving or chasing opponents away to control territory. This occurs when rival flies extend their wings laterally and stick their legs out in a \\"stilt-walk\\" then advance towards each other head-on while bobbing their heads up and down. Once they are at a close distance, they will directly interact by shoving the other male backwards. They will also use their forelegs to aggressively slash at each other. The evolution of the large body size in this species may be due to strong selection pressures since male body size is correlated with fighting success. Adult males signal their willingness to mate by creating their lek, which incorporates a small segment long of a horizontal tree fern or bare plant stem. These easily-visible leks are found above their plant substrate, where females feed and oviposit on fermenting wood. To defend against damage from winds, these leks are often chosen to be underneath the canopy of large trees. The number of males per plant varies, as males are often alone in their territories but can also cluster in groups. Up to ten males can occupy a single shrub by establishing separate territories on their own fern or branch. While these adult males are visibly exposed, immature males are often hidden. Females will also be concealed unless they are in search of courtship and are enticed by the wing-waving display of an adult male. A male D. silvestris will walk back and forth in his lek while waving his wings to entice females to enter his territory. The flies have sharp eyesight, allowing the female to be visually informed by the male's species-specific pigment patterns to identify whether they are the same species. The male behaves agonistically towards any insect that enters his lek, so when a female D. silvestris comes towards him, he will behave aggressively until he is able to establish her identity. = Courtship = In the first step of courtship, one of the sexes laterally extends their wings and repeatedly waves them in air in the shape of a circle; this is followed by the male standing in front of the female. Once they are facing each other, the female will use her legs to slash at him and he will transition by circling around her. He will eventually stand behind her and place his head underneath her wings for 1.2 seconds before creating sounds by vibrating his laterally extended wings. In addition to producing simple courtship songs by vibrating his wings, the male will create low-amplitude purring noises by bobbing his abdomen. Next, the male D. silvestris will stroke his bristled foreleg tibia against the abdomen of the female to stimulate her. He will then attempt to inseminate the female by moving the tip of his abdomen towards her genitalia. The additional 20‚Äì30 tibial bristles found in D. silvestris males located in north and east Hawaii populations are a secondary sex characteristic and indicate the influence of sexual selection. Because the island of Hawaii is less than 500,000 years old, these extra bristles may represent a relatively new physical enhancement in courtship derived from the ancestral trait of only having two rows of bristles. Females from the derived populations (in the north and east) will mate with males from both the derived and ancestral populations. In contrast, females from the ancestral populations (in the south and west) will not mate with males from derived populations, instead only selecting males with only two rows of bristles. Sperm from the male will be stored inside the female's spermatheca. A female can easily mate again if her supply of sperm decreases; this contrasts with the wide variability of male reproductive success, as many males rarely mate and some may even remain virgins.  Life cycle  Clermontia, a common lobelioid Hawaiian host plant for D. silvestris D. silvestris females deposit their eggs on the decaying or fermenting bark of principal host plant Clermontia, a large, branched shrub scattered throughout the understory of Hawaiian rainforests. Egg deposition also occurs on the fermenting bark of Cyanea and Cheirodendron. For females, the pupal stage is when ovarian development starts. The ovaries do not fully mature until three weeks after eclosion. Neither sex is fully mature when it ecloses from the pupae. Males mature earlier: about one week after eclosion at which point their sperm is motile. Vitellogenesis, or the deposition of yolk into an oocyte, is necessary for ovarian maturation in a female. When an immature female is housed with sexually mature males, the female is behaviorally unreceptive to their sexual displays, yet vitellogenesis will occur about four days earlier than expected.  Food resources  Larvae and adults primarily feed on the fermenting bark of Clermontia due to its relatively large size compared to other Hawaiian lobelioids. The major ancestral host plant for members of plantibia subgroup is Clermontia, with derived species like D. silvestris evolving to feed on Cyanea and Cheirodendron, other flowering plants where females deposit their eggs. These plant substrates are often located in the dense understory of Hawaiian rainforests, underneath lekking sites.  Enemies  Vespula pensylvanica, a predator of D. silvestris Vespula pensyIvanica, a species of yellowjacket, is invasive to Hawaii and preys on D. silvestris and other members of Drosophila, resulting in significant population decline. Other predators include insect-eating birds endemic to Hawaii, such as the Chasiempsis sandwichens.  Conservation  D. silvestris and other flies in Hawaiian rainforests are sensitive to habitat loss due to climate change. Habitat loss due to the loss of endemic fauna as temperatures steadily rise may impact the distribution and survivability of these flies, which are already rare and declining. Habitat loss can be further exacerbated by logging, agriculture, and other human practices that destroy natural terrain. Feral pigs, goats, and other mammals will eat host plants like Clermontia and trample on terrain, threatening the habitat and food sources for these flies. In addition, trampling on terrain creates favorable soil conditions for the proliferation of invasive plant species that can outcompete native species. D. silvestris and other \\"picture- winged\\" flies interact with host plants and other organisms in Hawaiian rainforests, making them helpful for measuring the health of the ecosystem.

The station was the first in the Wood River Valley and spawned a successful FM station, KSKI-FM, which remains on the air. It ceased broadcasting due to economic difficulties spurred by the launch of radio station KECH-FM, which was KSKI-AM-FM's first competitor in the Sun Valley area. History KSKI signed on the air on November 17, 1960. The station was initially licensed to Sun Valley and gave the resort town its first full-time radio service, broadcasting from studios located in the Sun Valley Lodge at the resort and a transmitter in Ketchum. The original owner was Radio Sun Valley, Inc., with Roger Hagadone as president. It was not long before KSKI sought to move from Sun Valley. In 1963, it filed its first application to relocate its studio base and transmitter to Hailey; later that year, it went silent for what turned out to be two years while the station made the move. The FCC granted the application on September 8, 1965; while KSKI was to go on air from Hailey on December 1, it did not sign on until February 10, 1966. On February 1, 1969, Kent Frandsen became KSKI's general manager; four years later, he bought the station from Hagadone under the name Sun Valley Radio, Inc., for $1 plus the assumption of more than $41,000 in liabilities. Frandsen's ownership of KSKI saw the station apply in 1974 for a new FM station on 93.5 MHz, which would transmit from Bald Mountain and bring with it an expansion of the studios in Hailey. The FCC finally granted the KSKI-FM application in January 1977, and the station went on the air that August 3. KSKI AM simulcast its new FM sister from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. and again from 7 p.m. to midnight. KSKI-AM-FM were known for their eclectic mix of music programming, aiming to serve listeners in a market that had no other radio stations; the pair also gained a small but devoted audience in the larger Twin Falls area. The AM station changed its call letters to KNRC on December 2, 1985, but changed back to KSKI on July 1, 1987. (this change is missing from the FCC database) The station was airing a crossover country format by 1989. In November 1989, KSKI-AM-FM was sold to Silver Creek Communications, a company of businessman John McCaw, Jr., for $950,000; while McCaw owned cable systems and was in the middle of acquiring TV station group LIN Broadcasting, his other radio holdings were all in Alaska. The AM station continued to operate until late 1992. Economic difficulties in the local advertising market caused by the launch of competing station KECH-FM, which had taken to the air in 1988, prompted Silver Creek to shutter the AM station and send the license to the Federal Communications Commission for cancellation. Not long after, Silver Creek converted the operations of KSKI-FM to an automated service known as \\"The Mountain\\", programmed specifically for ski resort areas with special Sun Valley-specific inserts from its base at KZYR in Colorado.

A little known, or at least often forgotten about, way of expressing formulas for arithmetic functions and their summatory functions is to perform an integral transform that inverts the operation of forming the DGF of a sequence. This inversion is analogous to performing an inverse Z-transform to the generating function of a sequence to express formulas for the series coefficients of a given ordinary generating function. For now, we will use this page as a compendia of \\"oddities\\" and oft- forgotten facts about transforming and inverting Dirichlet series, DGFs, and relating the inversion of a DGF of a sequence to the sequence's summatory function. We also use the notation for coefficient extraction usually applied to formal generating functions in some complex variable, by denoting [n^{-s}] D_f(s) =: f(n) for any positive integer n \\\\geq 1, whenever :D_f(s) := \\\\sum_{n \\\\geq 0} \\\\frac{f(n)}{n^s}, \\\\quad \\\\Re(s) > \\\\sigma_{0,f}, denotes the DGF (or Dirichlet series) of f which is taken to be absolutely convergent whenever the real part of s is greater than the abscissa of absolute convergence, \\\\sigma_{0,f} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}. The relation of the Mellin transformation of the summatory function of a sequence to the DGF of a sequence provides us with a way of expressing arithmetic functions f(n) such that f(1) eq 0, and the corresponding Dirichlet inverse functions, f^{-1}(n), by inversion formulas involving the summatory function, defined by :S_f(x) := {\\\\sum_{n \\\\leq x}}^\\\\prime f(n), \\\\quad \\\\forall x \\\\geq 1. In particular, provided that the DGF of some arithmetic function f has an analytic continuation to s \\\\mapsto -s, we can express the Mellin transform of the summatory function of f by the continued DGF formula as :\\\\mathcal{M}[S_f](s) = -\\\\frac{D_f(-s)}{s}. It is often also convenient to express formulas for the summatory functions over the Dirichlet inverse function of f using this construction of a Mellin inversion type problem. Preliminaries: Notation, conventions and known results on DGFs =DGFs for Dirichlet inverse functions= Recall that an arithmetic function is Dirichlet invertible, or has an inverse f^{-1}(n) with respect to Dirichlet convolution such that (f \\\\ast f^{-1})(n) = \\\\delta_{n,1}, or equivalently f \\\\ast f^{-1} = \\\\mu \\\\ast 1 \\\\equiv \\\\varepsilon, if and only if f(1) eq 0. It is not difficult to prove that is D_f(s) is the DGF of f and is absolutely convergent for all complex s satisfying \\\\Re(s) > \\\\sigma_{0,f}, then the DGF of the Dirichlet inverse is given by D_{f^{-1}}(s) = 1 / D_f(s) and is also absolutely convergent for all \\\\Re(s) > \\\\sigma_{0,f}. The positive real \\\\sigma_{0,f} associated with each invertible arithmetic function f is called the abscissa of convergence. We also see the following identities related to the Dirichlet inverse of some function g that does not vanish at one: :\\\\begin{align}(g^{-1} \\\\ast \\\\mu)(n) & = [n^{-s}]\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta(s) D_g(s)}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ (g^{-1} \\\\ast 1)(n) & = [n^{-s}]\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\zeta(s)}{D_g(s)}\\\\right).\\\\end{align} =Summatory functions= Using the same convention in expressing the result of Perron's formula, we assume that the summatory function of a (Dirichlet invertible) arithmetic function f, is defined for all real x \\\\geq 0 according to the formula :S_f(x) := {\\\\sum_{n \\\\leq x}}^{\\\\prime} f(n) = \\\\begin{cases} 0, & 0 \\\\leq x < 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sum\\\\limits_{n < [x]} f(n), & x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\setminus \\\\mathbb{Z}^{+} \\\\wedge x \\\\geq 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sum\\\\limits_{n \\\\leq [x]} f(n) - \\\\frac{f(x)}{2}, & x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^{+}. \\\\end{cases} We know the following relation between the Mellin transform of the summatory function of f and the DGF of f whenever \\\\Re(s) > \\\\sigma_{0,f}: :D_f(s) = s \\\\cdot \\\\int_1^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{S_f(x)}{x^{s+1}} dx. Some examples of this relation include the following identities involving the Mertens function, or summatory function of the Moebius function, the prime zeta function and the prime counting function, and the Riemmann prime counting function: :\\\\begin{align}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta(s)} & = s \\\\cdot \\\\int_1^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{M(x)}{x^{s+1}} dx \\\\\\\\\\\\ P(s) & = s \\\\cdot \\\\int_1^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\pi(x)}{x^{s+1}} dx \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\log \\\\zeta(s) & = s \\\\cdot \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\Pi_0(x)}{x^{s+1}} dx.\\\\end{align} Statements of the integral formula for Dirichlet inversion =Classical integral formula= For any s such that \\\\sigma := \\\\Re(s) > \\\\sigma_{0,f}, we have that :f(x) \\\\equiv [x^{-s}] D_f(s) = \\\\lim_{T \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{2T} \\\\int_{-T}^T x^{\\\\sigma+\\\\imath t} D_f(\\\\sigma+\\\\imath t) \\\\, dt. If we write the DGF of f according to the Mellin transform formula of the summatory function of f, then the stated integral formula simply corresponds to a special case of Perron's formula. Another variant of the previous formula stated in Apostol's book provides an integral formula for an alternate sum in the following form for c,x > 0 and any real \\\\sigma > \\\\sigma_{0,f}-c where we denote \\\\Re(s) := \\\\sigma: :{\\\\sum_{n \\\\leq x}}^{\\\\prime} \\\\frac{f(n)}{n^s} = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi\\\\imath} \\\\int_{c-\\\\imath\\\\infty}^{c+\\\\imath\\\\infty} D_f(s+z) \\\\frac{x^z}{z} dz. Direct proof: From Apostol's book Special cases of the formula If we are interested in expressing formulas for the Dirichlet inverse of f, denoted by f^{-1}(n) whenever f(1) eq 0, we write D_f(s) = 1 + s \\\\cdot A_f(s). Then we have by absolute convergence of the DGF for any \\\\Re(s) > \\\\sigma_{0,f} that :\\\\begin{align}\\\\int \\\\frac{x^{\\\\imath t}}{D_f(\\\\sigma+\\\\imath t)} \\\\,dt & = \\\\int \\\\left(\\\\sum_{j \\\\geq 0} (\\\\sigma+\\\\imath t)^{j} \\\\times \\\\sum_{k=0}^{j} (-1)^k D_f(\\\\sigma+\\\\imath t)^k \\\\frac{\\\\log^{j-k}(x)}{(j-k)!}\\\\right) \\\\, dt.\\\\end{align} Now we can call on integration by parts to see that if we denote by F^{(-m)}(x) = \\\\sum_{n \\\\geq 0} \\\\frac{F^{(n)}(0)}{n!} x^{n+m} \\\\times \\\\frac{n!}{(n+m)!} denotes the m^{th} antiderivative of F, for any fixed non- negative integers k \\\\geq 0, we have :\\\\int (ax+b)^k \\\\cdot F(ax+b) \\\\, dx = \\\\sum_{j=0}^{k} \\\\frac{k!}{a \\\\cdot j!} (-1)^{k-j} t^j F^{(j+1-k)}(ax+b). Thus we obtain that :\\\\begin{align}\\\\int_{-T}^T \\\\frac{x^{\\\\imath t}}{D_f(\\\\sigma+\\\\imath t)} \\\\, dt & = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\imath} \\\\left(\\\\sum_{j \\\\geq 0} \\\\sum_{k=0}^j \\\\sum_{m=0}^k \\\\frac{k!}{m!} (-1)^m (\\\\sigma+\\\\imath t)^{m} \\\\left[D_f^k\\\\right]^{(j+1-k)}(\\\\sigma+\\\\imath t) \\\\frac{\\\\log^{j-k}(x)}{(j-k)!}\\\\right) \\\\Biggr_{t=-T}^{t=+T}.\\\\end{align} We also can relate the iterated integrals for the k^{th} antiderivatives of F by a finite sum of k single integrals of power-scaled versions of F: :F^{(-k)}(x) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \\\\binom{k-1}{i} \\\\frac{(-1)^i}{(k-1)!} \\\\int \\\\frac{F(x)}{x^i} \\\\, dx. In light of this expansion, we can then write the partially limiting T-truncated Dirichlet series inversion integrals at hand in the form of :\\\\begin{align}\\\\frac{1}{2T} \\\\int_{-T}^T \\\\frac{x^{\\\\imath t}}{D_f(\\\\sigma+\\\\imath t)} \\\\, dt & = \\\\frac{1}{2T \\\\cdot \\\\imath} \\\\left(\\\\sum_{j \\\\geq 0} \\\\sum_{k=0}^{j} \\\\sum_{m=0}^k \\\\sum_{n=0}^{j-k} \\\\binom{j-k}{n} \\\\frac{(-1)^{k+n+m} \\\\cdot k!}{(j-k)! \\\\cdot m!} (\\\\sigma+\\\\imath t)^{m} \\\\frac{\\\\log^{j-k}(x)}{(j-k)!} \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\sigma+\\\\imath t} \\\\left[A_f^k\\\\right](v) \\\\frac{dv}{v^n} \\\\right) \\\\Biggr_{t=-T}^{t=+T} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\frac{1}{2T \\\\cdot \\\\imath} \\\\left(\\\\sum_{j \\\\geq 0} \\\\sum_{k=0}^{j} \\\\sum_{m=0}^k \\\\frac{(-1)^{j-k} \\\\cdot (-s)^m}{m!} \\\\frac{\\\\log^{k}(x)}{k!} \\\\int_0^1 s \\\\cdot D_f^{j-k}(rs) \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{rs}\\\\right)^k \\\\, dv\\\\right) \\\\Biggr_{s=\\\\sigma-\\\\imath T}^{s=\\\\sigma+\\\\imath T} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\frac{s\\\\left(e^{-s}+O_s(1)\\\\right)}{2T \\\\cdot \\\\imath} \\\\int_0^{1} \\\\frac{x^{1-\\\\frac{1}{rs}}}{1+D_f(rs)} dr \\\\Biggr_{s=\\\\sigma-\\\\imath T}^{s=\\\\sigma+\\\\imath T} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\frac{\\\\left(e^{-s}+O_s(1)\\\\right)}{2T \\\\cdot \\\\imath} \\\\int_0^{s} \\\\frac{x^{1-\\\\frac{1}{v}}}{1+D_f(v)} \\\\, dv \\\\Biggr_{s=\\\\sigma-\\\\imath T}^{s=\\\\sigma+\\\\imath T}.\\\\end{align} =Statements in the language of Mellin transformations= =A formal generating-function-like convolution lemma= Suppose that we wish to treat the integrand integral formula for Dirichlet coefficient inversion in powers of (\\\\imath t)^k where [(\\\\imath t)^{k}] F(\\\\sigma+\\\\imath t) = F^{(k)})(\\\\sigma) / k!, and then proceed as if we were evaluating a traditional integral on the real line. Then we have that :\\\\begin{align}\\\\hat{D}_f(x; \\\\sigma, T) & := \\\\int_{-T}^T x^{\\\\sigma+\\\\imath t} D_f(\\\\sigma+\\\\imath t)\\\\, dt \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\sum_{m \\\\geq 0} \\\\int_{-T}^{T} x^{\\\\sigma+\\\\imath t} (\\\\imath t)^m \\\\frac{D_f^{(m)}(\\\\sigma)}{m!} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\sum_{m \\\\geq 0} \\\\int_{-T}^T t^{2m} x^{\\\\sigma+\\\\imath t} \\\\frac{(-1)^m D_f^{(2m)}(\\\\sigma)}{(2m)!}\\\\,dt + \\\\imath \\\\times \\\\sum_{m \\\\geq 0} \\\\int_{-T}^T t^{2m+1} x^{\\\\sigma+\\\\imath t} \\\\frac{(-1)^m A^{(2m+1)}(\\\\sigma)}{(2m+1)!} \\\\,dt.\\\\end{align} We require the result given by the following formula, which is proved rigorously by an application of integration by parts, for any non- negative integer m \\\\geq 0: :\\\\begin{align}\\\\hat{I}_m(T) & := \\\\int_{-T}^{T} \\\\frac{(\\\\imath t)^m}{m!} x^{\\\\imath t} \\\\,dt \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\sum_{r=0}^{m} \\\\frac{\\\\left(x^{\\\\imath T} + (-1)^{r+1} x^{-\\\\imath T}\\\\right) (-\\\\imath)^{r+1}}{\\\\log^{k+1-r}(x)} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{T^r}{r!} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\frac{\\\\cos(T \\\\log x)}{T \\\\log x} \\\\times \\\\sum_{r=0}^{\\\\lfloor k/2 \\\\rfloor} \\\\frac{(-1)^{r+1} T^{2r}}{\\\\log^{k-2r}(x) (2r)!} + \\\\frac{\\\\sin(T \\\\log x)}{T \\\\log x} \\\\times \\\\sum_{r=0}^{\\\\lfloor k/2 \\\\rfloor} \\\\frac{(-1)^{r+1} T^{2r+1}}{\\\\log^{k-2r-1}(x) (2r+1)!}.\\\\end{align} So the respective real and imaginary parts of our arithmetic function coefficients f at positive integers x satisfy: :\\\\begin{align}\\\\operatorname{Re}(f(x)) & = x^{\\\\sigma} \\\\times \\\\lim_{T \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\sum_{m \\\\geq 0} D_f^{(2m)}(\\\\sigma) \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\hat{I}_{2m}(T)}{2T} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{Im}(f(x)) & = x^{\\\\sigma} \\\\times \\\\lim_{T \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\sum_{m \\\\geq 0} D_f^{(2m+1)}(\\\\sigma) \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\hat{I}_{2m+1}(T)}{2T}.\\\\end{align} The last identities suggest an application of the Hadamard product formula for generating functions. In particular, we can work out the following identities which express the real and imaginary parts of our function f at x in the following forms To apply the integral formula for the Hadamard product, we observe that :\\\\begin{align}\\\\sum_{r=0}^{\\\\lfloor k/2 \\\\rfloor} \\\\frac{(-1)^{r+1} T^{2r}}{\\\\log^{k-2r}(x) (2r)!} & = -\\\\frac{1}{2}[z^k]\\\\left(\\\\frac{e^{\\\\imath T \\\\sqrt{z}}}{1-\\\\frac{z}{\\\\log x}} + \\\\frac{e^{-\\\\imath T \\\\sqrt{z}}}{1+\\\\frac{z}{\\\\log x}} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sum_{r=0}^{\\\\lfloor k/2 \\\\rfloor} \\\\frac{(-1)^{r+1} T^{2r+1}}{\\\\log^{k-2r-1}(x) (2r+1)!} & = -\\\\frac{1}{2}[z^{k}]\\\\left(\\\\frac{e^{\\\\imath T \\\\sqrt{z}}}{1-\\\\frac{z}{\\\\log x}} - \\\\frac{e^{-\\\\imath T \\\\sqrt{z}}}{1+\\\\frac{z}{\\\\log x}} \\\\right).\\\\end{align} From this observation, the formula stated below is now a standard application of the cited integral formula to compute the Hadamard product of two generating functions. : :\\\\begin{align}\\\\operatorname{Re}(f(x)) & = \\\\lim_{T \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\left[\\\\frac{x^{\\\\sigma}}{2T} \\\\times \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi} \\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^{\\\\pi} \\\\left(D_f(\\\\sigma+\\\\imath T \\\\cdot e^{\\\\imath s}) + D_f(\\\\sigma - \\\\imath T e^{\\\\imath s})\\\\right) \\\\left(FUNC(e^{-\\\\imath s})\\\\right) \\\\, ds\\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{Im}(f(x)) & = \\\\lim_{T \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\left[\\\\frac{x^\\\\sigma}{2T} \\\\times \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi} \\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^\\\\pi \\\\left(D_f(\\\\sigma+\\\\imath T \\\\cdot e^{\\\\imath s}) - D_f(\\\\sigma - \\\\imath T e^{\\\\imath s}\\\\right) () \\\\, ds \\\\right].\\\\end{align} Notice that in the special case where the arithmetic function f is strictly real-valued, we expect that the inner terms in the previous limit formula are always zero (i.e., for any T).

Wijewardene used Arcadia as a holiday retreat and to host distinguished guests during weekends, notably Lord Soulbury, Sir Fredrick Rees and Fredrick Burns who were members of the Soulbury Commission. On recommendations of the Soulbury Commission, Sri Lanka gained dominion status and independence in 1948. The house which remained in the Wijewardene family was used by family members such as Ray Wijewardene and Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Jean Thompson (born 1940) is a New Zealand statistician who served as president of the New Zealand Statistical Association from 1991 to 1993. Because she was a girl, Thompson was prevented from taking any mathematical subjects in high school until sixth form, when she was the top of her school's physics class. At university, she wanted to study statistics, but there was no program in that subject, so she earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics. She worked in the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (New Zealand), in their Applied Mathematics Division. She learned statistics on the job, and used an Elliott 503, the first scientific computer in New Zealand, to perform her analyses.

Most of his surviving works are watercolors and sketches.  Biography  He showed an early aptitude for art and, from 1919, was already associated with artistic circles in the Rhineland. He studied at the Essen campus of the Folkwang University of the Arts with the Dutch artist, Johan Thorn Prikker; following him when he went to teach at the Royal Kunstgewerbeschule, Munich, in 1921. He transferred to the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf in 1923, where he was a Master Student of Heinrich Campendonk and Heinrich Nauen. Levin in the 1930s Upon completing his studies in 1926, he received his first major commission: a mural for the GeSoLei. His earnings enabled him to make a study trip to Paris. In 1931, he would return to France; spending a summer in Marseille which was especially productive. From 1925 t0 1932, he was a member of the \\"Rheinischen Sezession\\" and \\"Young Rhineland\\". He held numerous exhibitions in D√ºsseldorf, Berlin and Nurnberg. From 1930 to 1939, he shared a studio in D√ºsseldorf- Stadtmitte with and other lesser-known artists.Immermannstra√üe 66, 4.

Reder was elected a member of the College of New Scholars of the Royal Society of Canada in 2018. As a faculty member at Simon Fraser University, she was a founding member of the Indigenous Literary Studies Association and served on the council from 2015-2018. Early life and education Reder comes from a Cree speaking M√©tis family born in Saskatchewan. Her family comes from La Ronge, √éle-√†-la-Crosse and Lac Dor√©, Quebec. Her father was a member of the army and the family lived off an army base until Reder was five years old. Her parents did not graduate high school and preferred that Reder speak English over the Indigenous tongue. Reder says she began to see the importance of accurately representing Indigenous people in the media when her mother read \\"Halfbreed\\" by Maria Campbell. She stated this was the only book she saw her mother read and her mother was excited to read a book that accurately represented her life. Growing up, Reder says the only Native literature she read was Pauline Johnson's book \\"The Song my Paddle Sings.\\" While attending York University for her Masters of Arts, Reder chose to focus on Aboriginal literature but found it difficult to find courses. She instead chose to focus on nineteenth-century Canadian literature. She was disappointed to learn that these studies focused on white women and lacked information on Indigenous authors. After earning her MA, Reder took a leave of absence from school to deal with her family. When she returned for her PhD in 2001, the school curriculum now included more Aboriginal focused content. In response to the Kimelman Report, Reder wrote that adult adoptees who were affected by these policies have begun to speak out about their losses: loss of their cultural identity, lost contact with their natural families, barred access from medical histories, and for status Indian children, the loss of their status.Reder, Deanna.

University of British Columbia Career In 2010, Reder published \\"Troubling Tricksters: Revisioning Critical Conversations\\" with Linda M. Morra through Wilfrid Laurier University Press. Troubling Tricksters was a collection of text revolving around the trickster discourse in Indigenous literature. In 2012, Reder was one of the core faculty members involved with the introduction of a new First Nations studies program at SFU. The new program, which became effective in April 2012, included certificates in First Nations studies research and major, minor, and joint major with archaeology and linguistics. The following year, Reder was part of a council of Indigenous and settler scholars that created the Indigenous Literary Studies Association (ILSA). As president of ILSA, she coordinated with Sam McKegney at Queen's to organize a literary award recognizing Indigenous authors in Canada. In 2015, she became a Co-Investigator with Daniel Heath Justice and Margery Fee on a SSHRC-funded project called The People And The Text. The project aimed to collected ignored texts and literature from Indigenous Canadians during the time of British colonization. Two years later, Reder edited Read, Listen, Tell: Indigenous Stories from Turtle Island with Sophie McCall, David Gaertner, and Gabrielle L'Hirondelle Hill. In 2018, Reder and Alix Shield published documents that had been omitted from \\"Halfbreed\\" as they had been deemed libellous. The documents were Campbell's account of being raped by Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers as a youth. She was also elected a member of the College of New Scholars of the Royal Society of Canada. She sits on the Board of Directors of the non-profit Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences. In June 2019, Reder was part of the committee that elected to remove a piece of art that misrepresented Aboriginal people as passive in the European colonization period of British Columbia.

Anti-Japanese activism  When the Empire of Japan occupied Northeast China in 1931 following the Mukden Incident, Liang participated in anti-Japanese activities organized by the underground Communist Party of China, and was expelled by his high school. He moved to Xiamen, Fujian, where he worked as an editor at the magazine Pinghua () and published articles condemning Japanese aggression. After Pinghua was shut down by the Kuomintang government, Liang returned to Shanghai to continue his education, and lived at the off-campus dorm of Jinan University, then located in Zhenru in the outskirts of Shanghai. In 1935, when the December 9th Movement broke out in Beijing against Japanese encroachment in North China, Liang joined Jinan students to petition the Kuomintang government in Nanjing to actively resist Japanese aggression. On the train to Nanjing, he met fellow petitioner Zhu Hanzhang (), a Jinan University student who later became his wife. In the summer of 1936, Liang moved to Kuala Lumpur, British Malaya. There he taught at Zunkong Middle School () founded by his brother Piyun, and organized anti-Japanese groups such as the Selangor Anti-Imperialism Union under the guidance of the Malayan Communist Party.  Wartime career  When Japan launched its full-scale invasion of China in July 1937, Liang returned to China to join the resistance. He enlisted in the New Fourth Army and fought in the guerrilla war in northern Jiangsu province. In 1940, he was appointed the county magistrate of Rugao and joined the Communist Party of China. He was later appointed county magistrate of Nantong and fought many battles against the forces of Japan and the puppet Wang Jingwei regime, even temporarily taking over the Japanese-occupied county seat of Haimen. During the Chinese Civil War which broke out after the surrender of Japan, Liang served as Commander of the 33rd Brigade of the and Chief of Staff of the 29th Corps of the People's Liberation Army. He fought in major battles including the Battle of Huangqiao, the Huaihai campaign, the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign, the Shanghai Campaign, and the Battle of Fuzhou.  People's Republic of China  After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Liang was appointed the first Mayor of Xiamen, Fujian, and worked to restore industrial production after the end of the civil war. In March 1956, he became Vice Governor of Fujian and a member of its provincial party standing committee. He was dismissed during the Cultural Revolution, but was restored to the party standing committee in early 1975, and appointed Deputy Director of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee. In November 1977, Liang was transferred to the national government to served as Minister of Light Industry. = Guangdong Province = In November 1980, at the beginning of the reform and opening era, Liang was transferred to Guangdong together with Ren Zhongyi, to replace Xi Zhongxun and Yang Shangkun, who had been transferred to Beijing. Liang served as First Party Secretary and Mayor of Guangzhou, the provincial capital, while Ren was appointed the provincial Party Chief. In March 1983, Liang was promoted to Governor of Guangdong, succeeding Liu Tianfu. He concurrently served as President of Jinan University, which had been reestablished in Guangzhou. He stepped down as governor in July 1985 and was succeeded by Ye Xuanping. Ren, Liu, Liang, and Ye were all considered reform pioneers who propelled the economic development of Guangdong in the 1980s. From 1985 to 1988, Liang served as Director of the Guangdong Provincial Advisory Commission, and concurrently as the first chairman of China Travel Service Group Corporation (CTS) of Hong Kong. In May 1988, he was elected a member of the Standing Committee of the 7th National People's Congress and served as Vice Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of the NPC. Liang was a member of the 12th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and a member of the 2nd, 5th, 6th, and 7th National People's Congresses. Liang died on 25 February 2006 in Guangzhou, aged 89.

Koldewey named it Lindeman Bai after Moritz Karl Adolf Lindeman (1823 ‚Äì 1908), secretary of the Association for German Polar Exploration (Verein f√ºr die Deutsche Nordpolarfahrt) in Bremen. Later, during the 1929‚Äì1930 Expedition to East Greenland led by Lauge Koch, more thorough surveys were made and the fjord was found to become narrow to the west and extend further inland, thus the water body was renamed \\"Lindeman Fjord\\".

He began his career as a baritone, but moved on to heldentenor and has performed roles in all tenor parts of Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen at Der Ring in Minden. He has appeared at major international opera houses and concert halls, and made recordings. Mohr is a professor of voice at the Hochschule f√ºr K√ºnste Bremen. He also runs an agricultural estate where he founded a music festival.  Career  Born in Neum√ºnster, Mohr studied voice at the Musikhochschule L√ºbeck from 1980 with Karl Heinz Pinhammer, and graduated in 1985 with distinction in the Konzertexamen (concert exam). He won prizes at international competitions already during his studies, such as the International Vocal Competition ¬¥s-Hertogenbosch, the VDMK competition in Berlin and the Walther Gruner Competition in London. He further studied with Anna Reynolds. = Baritone = Mohr made his operatic debut at the L√ºbeck Opera in 1984 as Silvio in Leoncavallo's Pagliacci. He was engaged as a baritone at the Theater Bremen (1985 to 1997) and Nationaltheater Mannheim, and then moved to the Oper Bonn in 1990, where he collaborated with notable directors such as Giancarlo del Monaco, J√ºrgen Rose, Werner Schroeter, Andr√°s Fricsay and . His roles there included Luna in Verdi's Il trovatore, Germont in Verdi's La traviata, Eisenstein in Die Fledermaus by Johann Strauss, Peter in Humperdinck's H√§nsel und Gretel, Almaviva in Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro and Papageno in Die Zauberfl√∂te. He took part in the world premiere of Manfred Trojahn's Enrico at the 1991 Schwetzingen Festival with the ensemble of the Bavarian State Opera. He appeared as a guest at the Opernhaus Z√ºrich, the Semperoper in Dresden, and the Liceu in Barcelona, among others. In concert, he performed the solo parts in Carl Orff's Carmina burana, Ein deutsches Requiem by Brahms, and Britten's War Requiem. Mohr has worked freelance since 1997. He collaborated with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and performed at the Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival and Ludwigsburg Festival, among others. = Tenor = Mohr turned to roles of the tenor and heldentenor repertoire, performing the title role of Mozart's Idomeneo and Siegmund in Wagner's Die Walk√ºre directed by Robert Carsens in the 2005/06 season at the Cologne Opera. He appeared as Wagner's Parsifal at the Theater Erfurt in 2006. In operetta, he was Danilo in Lehar's Die lustige Witwe in Cologne, and Eisenstein in Die Fledermaus at the Bavarian State Opera. Mohr performed the role of Max in Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz in both Cologne and at the Theater St. Gallen. Mohr appeared as Loge in Wagner's Das Rheingold at the Oper Leipzig in 2013. A review noted: \\"Thomas Mohr as Loge was a standout, his tenor full of colour and flexibility, revealing the complex character of a trickster who is also a sympathetic demigod. He infused meaning to every word, whispering intrigues and plotting schemes. His clear and ringing high notes cut through the orchestra; his legato made me realize that Wagner could be sung as Mozart.\\" Mohr also performed the title role of Siegfried in G√∂tterd√§mmerung there in 2016. In the project Der Ring in Minden, he sang Loge in 2015, Siegmund in 2016, then the title role of Siegfried in 2017, with a review noting good declamation, rhythmic precision, tender legato, and brilliance in the final duet, and finally Siegfried in G√∂tterd√§mmerung in 2018. In the complete cycle in 2019, he sang all four roles. = Teaching = Mohr has been professor of voice at the Hochschule f√ºr K√ºnste Bremen since the 2002/03 semester. Among his students is tenor Mirko Ludwig. = Agriculture and festival = Mohr also runs an agricultural estate, Isemohr, in Kleinkummerfeld near Neum√ºnster.

His first experience in Latin America was in Argentina where he worked at the Consejo Nacional de Desarrollo (Conade) in 1964-65 under the auspices of the Harvard Development Advisory Service. He teamed with British economist Geoffrey Maynard to develop a stabilization model which was applied by the following administration during the period 1967-1970.

Scored for four-part choir, solo tenor and organ, the pieces were written between 1944 and 1956 \\"for the King's College, Cambridge\\" ( in Latin). The first of the pieces were first published by Novello in 1947, and they have become a popular piece of music in the Anglican church music repertoire.  Text  The text of the first service setting for the daily service of Mattins in the Anglican church consists of two pieces: the , an ancient Latin Christian hymn; and the a setting of Psalm 100. The setting of the evening canticles, part of the Anglican daily service of Evening Prayer, consists of the (Song of Mary) and (Song of Simeon). Mary sings the Magnificat (\\"My soul doth magnify the Lord\\") on the occasion of her visit to Elizabeth, as narrated in the Gospel of Luke (). Simeon sings the Nunc dimittis (\\"Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace\\") when Jesus is presented in the temple (). Howells also set the text of the Office of the Holy Communion to music; like the morning and evening offices, the text is taken from the Book of Common Prayer. Because the Anglican liturgy is originally derived from the Roman Catholic Ordinary of the Mass, the pieces correspond with the sections of a Mass setting: , , , , and . Each section is titled in Greek or Latin, but the text is in the English translation, and the Gloria is sung at the end of the service according to the liturgy of the Book of Common Prayer.  Composition  Collegium Regale was dedicated to Kings College King's College, Cambridge (pictured: the chapel) In 1941, Howells took the post of acting organist of St John's College, Cambridge, standing in for Robin Orr who was away on active service in World War II. Howells attended a tea party held by Eric Milner-White, then Dean of King's College. There, he also met the Director of Music at King's, Boris Ord, and the organist of Gonville and Caius College, Patrick Hadley. The three men challenged Howells to a bet of one guinea that he could not compose a canticle setting for the Choir of King's College Chapel. Howells successfully produced a setting of the ; he later remarked that it was \\"the only Te Deum to be born of a decanal bet\\". Following the challenge made at the Deanery tea, other settings followed: the for Mattins in 1944, and in 1945 he completed the and for Choral evensong. He revisited the music in 1956 for his setting of the Office of the Holy Communion (Collegium Regale). Praising the Collegium Regale settings, Paul Spicer, a pupil of Howells, has stated that \\"one guinea kickstarted music for the Anglican Church into a whole new phase of existence\\". Howells's Collegium Regale evening canticles are among his best-known works and noted for their use of choral voices. While many Anglican settings of the begin with full choir or male voices, Howells opens the work with treble voices, emphasising the feminine voice of Mary's song. Correspondingly, the words of Simeon in the are initially conveyed by a solo tenor voice. Explaining his choice of voices, Howells stated that \\"‚Ä¶ if I made a setting of the Magnificat, the mighty should be put down from their seat without a brute force which would deny this canticle‚Äôs feminine association. Equally, that in the Nunc dimittis, the tenor‚Äôs domination should characterize the gentle Simeon. Only the Gloria should raise its voice.\\" Selected recordings * A Celebration Of Herbert Howells ‚Äî The Choir of King's College, Cambridge, Stephen Cleobury (Argo, 1992) * Howells: Requiem, Take Him, Earth, For Cherishing (And Other Choral Works), Choir Of St John's College, Cambridge, Christopher Robinson, Iain Farrington (Naxos, 1999) See also *List of compositions by Herbert Howells  References  Works cited   External links  * Keller, Benjamin T.: An Historical Perspective on the Choral Music of Herbert Howells as Found in the Anglican Canticle Settings Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis for Saint Paul's Cathedral (Dissertation) University of Arizona 1986 Category:Choral compositions Col Reg Category:1944 compositions Category:Compositions by Herbert Howells Category:King's College, Cambridge ","title":"Collegium Regale (Howells)"},{"id":"61871522","text":"Bugry () is a rural locality (a settlement) in Novonikolayevsky Selsoviet, Rubtsovsky District, Altai Krai, Russia.

Among the personal issues faced by the sisters and those surrounding them: Chessy's affair, the return of their long-lost father, Juts' relationship with Josephine, her unforgiving mother-in-law, and the adoption of Nicole by Juts and Chessy. In the aftermath of Pearl Harbor, the residents of Runnymede face new challenges: Civil defense, racism against the only Japanese resident of Runnymede, and other events, both comic and dramatic, such as mistaking migrating Canadian geese for German bombers, and how the sisters open the Curl n' Twirl salon to pay off a debt due to damage caused by one of their fiercest fights. The narrative spans a decade in the life of the sisters and the zany inhabitants of Runnymede, ending in 1950, with Wheezie and Juts feeling older and wiser, and just as dedicated as ever to their fractious relationship.  Characters  * Wheezie and Juts Hunsenmeir: The continually quibbling sisters, who lead the madcap adventures of the town of Runnymede. Wheezie is upset at reaching the age of forty, while Juts is upset at her inability to have a child. * Chessy Smith: Husband of Juts, has an affair with dance teacher Trudy Archer. * Nicole \\"Nickel\\" Smith: Adopted daughter of Juts and Chessy. * Mary: Wheezie's daughter, facing the scandal of teen pregnancy. * Cora Hunsenmeir: Mother of Wheezie and Juts, maid and friend of Celeste Chalfonte. * Josephine Smith: Juts' judgmental and unforgiving mother-in-law. * Hansford Hunsenmeir: Long-lost father of Wheezie and Juts, husband of Cora. * Celeste Chalfonte: Beautiful, willful, aristocratic woman, in her middle sixties. In a 39-year relationship with Ramelle. * Ramelle Chalfonte: Celeste's long-term partner, and the wife of Celeste's brother, Curtis.  Reception  Chicago Tribune critic, Michael Bolden, celebrates the return to the \\"fascinating\\" town of Runnymede. Though he finds the novel to fall flat at times, is forgiving due to the entertainment Loose Lips provides: \\"Brown's comedy is like a visit with relatives whose behavior both amuses and horrifies you. At times, you can't help but laugh aloud, and when the spectacle ends, you understand the people a little more, even if you think they're crazy.\\" Similarly, the Kirkus review enjoyed the return to the familiar and beloved Runnymede and its \\"wacky\\" denizens, and found that Loose Lips is filled with \\"vivid characters and strong women. The frequent one-liners often seem more sitcom than novel material, going nowhere and telling less, but there are still good laughs along the way.\\" The Denver Post positively describes the Hunsenmeir sisters as women who \\"insist on grabbing life by the throat. ('Life can't pass us by,' says Juts. 'We ARE life.'),\\" yet finds the characters to be \\"self-indulgent - more sitcom characters than people you want to like,\\" in spite of Brown's \\"sharp dialogue.\\" Critic Sybil Downing concludes that \\"although Loose Lips is light and generally forgettable, Brown's keen observations on life and its comedic side so often edged by tragedy make it worth the read.\\"  References   External links  * Category:1999 novels Category:American LGBT novels Category:Lesbian literature ","title":"Loose Lips (novel)"},{"id":"61871564","text":"Thomas Blomqvist (born 15 January 1965) is a Finnish politician, born in Eken√§s in current Raseborg.

It premiered at the 2019 San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival, where it won the Silver Shell for Best Director and the Jury Prize for Best Screenplay. At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, young newlyweds Higinio and Rosa are worried about the risk of reprisal killings, as Higinio is a Republican. He hides in a hole underneath their house with his wife's help. Despite the constant threat of discovery, as the Falangists search for him, the couple's love helps them to remain resilient. Higonio becomes increasingly isolated in his hiding spot, where he stays until the 1969 amnesty. The story is told in chapter-like sections, each with titles alluding to the themes. Plot In 1936, at the start of the Spanish Civil War, a newly-married man who has criticized Franco's army and government fears that he will be the victim of reprisal killings and goes into hiding. As Falangists search for him, he hides under the floor of his house with the help of his wife. The first section, titled ‚Äúcampeada‚Äù (\\"to run‚Äù) depicts his first period where he is on the run from his pursuers. The next section is titled ‚Äúesconder‚Äù (‚Äúto hide‚Äù) shows his betrayal by his neighbor, and then his move to a trench dug under the kitchen. The next section is titled ‚Äúdetenci√≥n‚Äù (‚Äútemporary loss of freedom‚Äù). During this section, the couple start to imagine that the Nationalists will win the civil war, but this is only a fantasy. The next section is titled ‚ÄúPeligro‚Äù (\\"danger\\"). As the political situation worsens, Higinio's wife is arrested, but she does not betray her husband's hiding place. The next section is titled ‚Äúencerrar‚Äù (‚Äúshut down‚Äù). It is about his isolation in his hiding spot. His wife gets pregnant with their child, and at times she is gone from the house for periods. When two gay men start staying in the house, Higinio befriends them. The next section is called ‚ÄúApartado‚Äù (‚Äúremote‚Äù). Higinio starts to feel very isolated and detached from outside world, which he can only see in glimpses through the curtains or from muffled spunds. He tries to follow the news on the radio and TV to learn more. In the ‚Äúcambiar‚Äù (‚Äúchange‚Äù) and ‚Äúfranco‚Äù (‚Äúfrank‚Äù) sections, Higino goes through a major change. With the birth of his son, Higinio starts to reconsider whether he should remain in hiding. His wife tells him the family has been needing his help. In the next section, his wife and son start to question why he remains in hiding, arguing that no one is still looking for him. In the neighborhood, it is becoming well known that he is living under the house. However, he has become habituated to his isolation, and it is hard for him to leave his hole. The next chapter is titled ‚Äúdesenterrar‚Äù. Higinio realizes that it is probably safe to come out of hiding. When the Franco government announces an amnesty, and pardons him for his political offenses, he still cannot leave the trench. After 33 years, his isolation has become his normal life. The final chapter, ‚ÄúSalir‚Äù (‚Äúgo out‚Äù), begins when his wife, Rosa, leaves him, realizing that Higinio is too trapped in fear. Finally, he manages to leave the hole in 1969, as many other \\"topos\\" (\\"moles\\") show themselves again.

He received the John Howland Award in 1988. Early life Dancis was born on March 19, 1916, in Brooklyn and was raised in the Bronx. He attended Columbia College from 1931 to 1934 and received an M.D. from Saint Louis University School of Medicine in 1938. After graduating, he returned to New York City to complete a rotating internship and a residency in pediatrics at Queens General Hospital. He served in the U.S. Army from 1941 to 1945 and was stationed in Hawaii. He achieved the rank of Captain. He subsequently completed his training in pediatrics at Bellevue Hospital. Career and research Dancis was appointed as an academic in the Bellevue Hospital pediatrics department led by L. Emmett Holt Jr. In the early 1950s, in order to advance his understanding of biochemistry, metabolism and radioisotopes, Dancis spent a year each at the New York University Department of Biochemistry and the Sloan Kettering Institute. He noticed that none of the staff members at Bellevue were particularly interested in neonatology, or study of the newborn, and so decided to \\"fill the vacuum\\" himself. He made significant contributions to the research of inborn errors of metabolism; this included identifying with colleagues the enzyme defect that causes maple syrup urine disease. He also published important research on familial dysautonomia, Lesch‚ÄìNyhan syndrome, and retinopathy of prematurity. He was particularly interested in the placenta, studying its role in synthesis as well as transport of substances from mother to fetus. Dancis was appointed chairman of the pediatrics department at the New York University School of Medicine in 1974. He was elected president of the American Pediatric Society in 1983 and received the APS's most prestigious award, the John Howland Award, in 1988. During his career, he authored a total of 258 publications. Death Dancis died in New York City on March 30, 2010.

He apprenticed about 1765 to his father, then joined his shop on Front Street, between Chestnut and Walnut Streets. On June 15, 1780, he married Ruth Hoskins at Burlington, New Jersey. In 1784 he took over his father's business, then from 1785-1791 partnered with his brother, Nathaniel Richardson, as I. & N. RICHARDSON. On December 12, 1795, George Washington appointed him Assayer of the Philadelphia Mint, which position he held until his death. From 1795-1802 he partnered with James Howell in Philadelphia PA as RICHARDSON & Co., from 1802-1810 worked solo, and ultimately sold his business to Howell. Richardson is best known for his Washington Indian Peace Medals, as he created some of the 1793 and all of the 1795 medals. This followed naturally from his earlier assistance to his father in the Friendly Association for Regaining and Preserving Peace with the Indians by Pacific Measures (founded 1755).

Troja earned a M.Phil. in physics and astronomy at Palermo in 2005 under Fabio Reale. Her graduate thesis was titled XMM-Newton observations of the supernova remnant IC 443: analysis of the thermal X-ray emission. She completed a Ph.D. in physics and astronomy in 2009 under advisor Giancarlo Cusumano. Her dissertation was titled Gamma-ray bursts in the Swift era: evidence of long lived central engines and implications for progenitor models. From July 2009 to July 2012, Troja was a postdoctoral fellow at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) under advisor Neil Gehrels.  Career  Troja was a research associate at University of Maryland, College Park (UMD) and GSCF from July 2012 to July 2013. In July 2013, she became the Swift Guest Investigator Program Lead at GSCF. She became an assistant research scientist at UMD and GSCF in July 2015. = Research = Troja researches high energy astrophysics, gamma-ray bursts, and electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational waves. In her career Troja worked on a variety of different aspects of the GRB phenomenon, although her focus is the connection between short duration GRBs, neutron star mergers, and gravitational wave sources. In 2017 she led the discovery of X-ray emission from the gravitational wave source GW170817. Troja's main interest is to investigate the observational signatures of compact binary mergers, that is, binary systems composed by either two neutron stars (NS-NS) or a neutron star and a black hole (NS-BH) which slowly spiral into each other and eventually collide due to energy losses to gravitational radiation. Compact binary mergers lie at the intersection of several key aspects of modern astrophysics: * they are the most likely cause of short duration gamma-ray bursts; * they are strong sources of gravitational wave radiation, and prime candidates for direct detection with advanced LIGO and Virgo; * they are the most promising r-process sites for the formation of all the heavy elements (i.e. gold, platinum, uranium, ‚Ä¶) found on Earth. These three fundamental areas of investigation are at the core of Troja's research. = Awards and Honors = Troja has won the following awards: * NASA Silver Achievement Medal (2018) *Italian Bilateral Scientific Cooperation Award (2018) to recognize an Italian eminent scientist who, in performing his/her research abroad, has made a remarkable contribution to the advancement of science and technology, thus improving Italy‚Äôs S&T; relations with foreign countries and with International Organizations.

Marketing Strategy and Management (5th Edition). MacMillan International Higher Education, 2014 The classifications are for yellow goods, red goods, and orange goods, with orange goods being goods that have a mix of yellow and red characteristics. The classification of goods into yellow, red, and orange categories is roughly equivalent to the categories of shopping goods, convenience goods, and specialty goods. Yellow goods Yellow goods (also called \\"shopping goods\\" or \\"white goods\\") are durable consumer items such as large household appliances that have a long period of useful life, and which are replaced rarely.Kroon, Richard W. A/V A to Z: An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Media, Entertainment and other Audiovisual Terms. McFarland, 2010. p. 111 While yellow goods are sold in low volumes, they have high profit margins.Kroon, Richard W. A/V A to Z: An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Media, Entertainment and other Audiovisual Terms. McFarland, 2010. p. 111 Yellow goods have a higher unit value than convenience goods and people buy them less often; as such consumers spend more time comparison shopping for yellow goods than for red goods. As well, there is a much greater role for personal selling (from salespeople) for yellow goods than for red goods, and there is more selective distribution of yellow goods. Yellow goods often need to be adjusted or customized by the store before they are delivered to the customer. The consumer goods term \\"yellow goods\\" is different from the construction and agricultural industry term of the same name, which refers to bulldozers, tractors, and similar equipment. Red goods Red goods (also called \\"convenience goods\\") such as food are consumed completely when the consumer uses them; as a result, they are replaced frequently and sold in high volumes.Kroon, Richard W. A/V A to Z: An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Media, Entertainment and other Audiovisual Terms. McFarland, 2010. p. 111 Red goods have low profit margins. Kroon, Richard W. A/V A to Z: An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Media, Entertainment and other Audiovisual Terms. McFarland, 2010. p. 111 Red goods need heavy advertising and competitive pricing, along with a well-developed selling organization to manage the widespread and numerous points of sale. As red goods are widely available through a wide distribution network, consumers do not have to spend much time searching for them. Orange goods Orange goods (also called \\"specialty goods\\") are moderately durable goods that wear out with regular use and have to be replaced, such as clothing.Kroon, Richard W. A/V A to Z: An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Media, Entertainment and other Audiovisual Terms.

It was a collaboration between two American, non-profit news organizations, The Marshall Project and ProPublica. The article was written by Ken Armstrong and T. Christian Miller. It won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting and the 2015 George Polk Award for Justice Reporting. The article alternates between two true stories of events occurring between August 2008 and June 2012. The first narrative is about a woman in Lynnwood, Washington, known pseudonymously as \\"Marie\\", who reports being raped to the police. After repeated interrogation by the police, who do not believe her, she says that her report was false. She is subsequently charged with a gross misdemeanor for false reporting. The second narrative details the police investigations into a serial rapist in Colorado, who is known to have raped four women and made a fifth attempt. The man is arrested in February 2011, and subsequent evidence on his hard drive reveals that Marie, not previously known to the local investigative team, was raped by him. T. Christian Miller of ProPublica had been reporting on law enforcement failures in identifying rapists throughout 2015. In August, he learned of the case of Marie and contacted her lawyer, discovering that Ken Armstrong of The Marshall Project was already working on a similar story. They began to collaborate, with Armstrong writing about Marie's story in Washington and Miller writing about the police investigation in Colorado. Marie agreed to speak to Armstrong after six months of communication. The article was further informed by other interviews and thousands of pages of public records material. The article was later adapted into the Netflix series Unbelievable, which has received critical acclaim. The article also provided the basis of Miller and Armstrong's full-length book A False Report: A True Story of Rape in America (2018). Background =History= \\"An Unbelievable Story of Rape\\" was written by Ken Armstrong and T. Christian Miller. A collaboration between The Marshall Project and ProPublica, it was published on both websites on December 16, 2015. Colorado publication Westword reprinted the article as their cover story on May 19, 2016. The Marshall Project and ProPublica are American non-profit online news organizations. The Marshall Project specializes in criminal justice. T. Christian Miller was a senior reporter at ProPublica. Throughout 2015, he had been reporting on the failure of law enforcement to trace rapists, including the case of Darren Sharper, a football player who raped nine women. Miller had discovered that a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) database to identify serial murderers and rapists was mostly unused in the cases of rape, as most police departments fail to upload sexual assault reports. His article \\"The FBI Built a Database That Can Catch Rapists ‚Äî Almost Nobody Uses It\\" was published in July 2015. By August 2015, Miller was working on a report about the Washington and Colorado serial rape cases, with focus on the woman who recanted a report of rape after intense police interrogation, proven true years later by the rapist's conviction‚Äîknown in the article by her middle name \\"Marie\\". Miller called the woman's lawyer and discovered she was in contact with Ken Armstrong of The Marshall Project, who had been working on an article about the case for several months. The teams decided to collaborate. =Research and writing= Armstrong's editor Joe Sexton and Miller's editor Bill Keller had worked together at The New York Times. Numerous other editors contributed to the article, including managing editor Kirsten Danis of The Marshall Project. As the two reporters and two primary editors were all male, the team ensured that they consulted various women, some with knowledge of the case and some without, particularly in regards to how graphic or detailed to make the description of Marie's rape. Miller wrote the sections about the woman in Colorado, while Armstrong wrote the sections about the investigation in Washington. The sections are ordered alternately, with an opening paragraph about the woman in Washington being charged with false reporting. The structure was proposed by Sexton. The first draft was 15,000 words in length, shortened to 12,000 in the final version. Keller and other editors recommended cutting down on the ending of the article, yielding a short epilogue. For the article, Armstrong and Miller made public records requests to police departments and prosecuting attorney's offices in Washington and Colorado. They received thousands of pages of documents, including investigative reports, case reviews, crime scene photographs and footage of surveillance and O'Leary after his arrest. News coverage, criminal justice guidelines and court transcripts were also consulted. Extracts of an external report made of the police department that investigated Marie's case were made public for the first time in the article. After seven months of email and phone communication with Marie's lawyer, Marie agreed to speak to Armstrong. It was the first time she had agreed to be interviewed by a journalist. Armstrong and Miller also interviewed two of Marie's foster parents and her friend, her public defender and civil suit attorney. The pair spoke to various police officers, including Detectives Stacy Galbraith and Edna Hendershot who investigated the Colorado cases. Three officers in the Lynnwood Police Department were interviewed, including Mason, one of the officers who handled Marie's request. The interviews were made late in the process, the department having refused earlier requests for comment. The other officer, Rittgarn, declined to be interviewed. The perpetrator of the serial rapes, Marc O'Leary, was also interviewed. A brief audio recording of Marie describing her rape is included in the article. Summary In Lynnwood, Washington, an 18-year-old woman, referred to as \\"Marie,\\" reported being bound, gagged and raped at knifepoint to police. Following police confrontation about inconsistencies in her story, she said that she made the incident up. In March 2009, she was charged with a gross misdemeanor, fined $500 and put on probation. Marie had been sexually and physically abused in early life and was in foster care for most of her childhood. She joined Project Ladder at age 18, a program designed for people transitioning from foster care to living alone. In Golden, Colorado, during January 2011, Detective Stacy Galbraith interviewed a woman who was raped at gunpoint for four hours. When Galbraith talked to her husband, also a police officer, he observed familiarity with an incident reported to his police department in Westminster. Galbraith began collaboration with Westminster Detective Edna Hendershot, who had investigated two cases in which women aged 59 and 65 were raped in similar ways. They also discovered a burglary where a masked man had attempted to tie up a 46-year-old woman, who jumped out of her window and was badly injured. The four known cases took place in different suburbs of Denver. The man had gone to extreme lengths to avoid leaving DNA evidence, but touch DNA from the same paternal family line was found at three of the four crime scenes. Marie had made her report in August 2008 to Sergeant Jeffrey Mason and Jerry Rittgarn. Police guidelines advised that rape victims should not be interrogated, as they may be uncertain of details or report conflicting information. Investigating Marie's report, police found evidence of an assailant and abrasions to Marie's vagina and wrist. However, two of Marie's former foster parents began to disbelieve her due to her seemingly calm demeanour, one reporting doubts to the police. Following this, and Marie's conflicting account of when she phoned a friend, Mason and Rittgarn made Marie repeat her story, Rittgarn saying that he disbelieved her. He asked if the rapist was real and she said \\"no.\\" Without reading the Miranda warning, they asked her to write that she had made a false report. She wrote instead that she had dreamed the incident, now unsure of what happened. After hours of further questioning, Marie wrote that she had been lying. Project Ladder staff made Marie return to police when she said she made the report under duress. She asked to take a polygraph test‚Äîthough such tests do not provide reliable evidence‚Äîbut declined when Rittgarn threatened jail and loss of housing if she failed it. Mason filed a false reporting charge; such charges in similar circumstances were rare. Marie became the subject of media reports and an attack website. She quit her Costco job and considered suicide. In October 2008, one of Marie's foster parents saw a report of a woman in Kirkland, Washington, raped in the same way as Marie. Kirkland police abandoned this lead after Lynnwood police told them at least twice that Marie's account was a lie. In February 2011, a report was unearthed of a suspicious vehicle registered to army veteran Marc Patrick O'Leary, who lived in Lakewood, Colorado, and whose description matched the attacker. FBI agents collected DNA evidence from his brother which showed one of them was the rapist. A search warrant led to the arrest of O'Leary. He possessed a mask, gun, women's underwear and other identifying evidence. Photographs of Marie were found on O'Leary's hard drive. O'Leary had watched women for hundreds of hours, breaking into their houses multiple times before each rape. In December 2011, O'Leary was sentenced to 327.5 years in prison for four incidents in Colorado. In June 2012, he was sentenced to an additional 38.5 years for two incidents in Washington. An external report by Sergeant Gregg Rinta, who worked for the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office as a sex crimes supervisor, condemned the handling of Marie's case. It described the officers' behaviour as \\"bullying\\" and highlighted threats of jail and housing assistance removal as \\"coercive, cruel, and unbelievably unprofessional.\\" An internal review also concluded that Mason and Rittgarn's behaviour was \\"designed to elicit a confession of false reporting.\\" In 2015, the commander of Lynnwood's Criminal Investigations Division said that practices had since changed. Neither Mason nor Rittgarn were disciplined. After Marie approached Mason, he offered an apology. Marie sued the city, winning $150,000. By the time of the article, Marie was married with two children. Response The article won the 2015 George Polk Award for Justice Reporting, presented by Long Island University, and the 2016 Al Nakkula Award for Police Reporting, awarded by the University of Colorado Boulder and Denver Press Club. It also won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting, the article being described as \\"a startling examination and expos√© of law enforcement's enduring failures to investigate reports of rape properly and to comprehend the traumatic effects on its victims\\". It was a finalist in the 2016 National Magazine Awards in the Feature Writing category. Nora Caplan-Bricker of Slate reflected that \\"Marie's story helps remind us that false reports of rape are the exception, not the rule\\", believing that the article shows the \\"ruinous consequences\\" and \\"ubiquity\\" of rape victims being disbelieved. Writing for the alternative Wisconsin newspaper Isthmus, Bill Lueders praised the article and compared it to his own reporting about a similar case from 1997 to 2001, where a woman was charged by police after ostensibly making a false report of rape, but was later proven truthful by DNA evidence leading to her rapist's conviction. The University of Colorado Boulder reported in 2016 that law enforcement officials had requested to use the article in training. Jennifer Gentile Long, CEO of AEquitas: The Prosecutors' Resource on Violence Against Women, commented that the article presented an \\"extraordinary learning opportunity for both criminal justice professionals and ordinary citizens alike\\". Journalist Pamela Colloff referenced the article as an example of good reporting on criminal justice, as it is told from the perspective of a survivor. Related media \\"An Unbelievable Story of Rape\\" was published on December 16, 2015. In the days following, Miller and Armstrong published two subsequent articles: \\"A Brutal Crime, Often Terribly Investigated\\" enumerated five recommendations for police institutions to improve their handling of rape cases, while \\"Rape is Rape, Isn't It?\\" commented on the changing definition of rape used by the FBI. In December 2015, ProPublica published a podcast episode where Miller and Armstrong discussed the article. At the Investigative Reporters and Editors' 2016 conference, the pair gave a talk about their experience writing the article. In July 2016, they appeared on the Longform podcast to discuss the article. Armstrong appeared on Utah Public Radio in November 2016, discussing the article on Access Utah. = \\"An Anatomy of Doubt\\"= \\"An Anatomy of Doubt\\" is the 581st episode of the American radio program and podcast This American Life. It adapts \\"An Unbelievable Story of Rape\\". Credited as a collaboration with The Marshall Project and ProPublica, it debuted on February 26, 2016. The hour-long episode features Ira Glass, Ken Armstrong and Robyn Semien and includes interviews with Marie, Mason and two of Marie's foster parents. = A False Report= Armstrong and Miller adapted their article and additional research into a 304-page book, A False Report: A True Story of Rape in America. It was published on February 6, 2018 by the Crown Publishing Group. The book expands upon details of the case like O'Leary's perspective and subjects such as victim blaming and social media harassment. Mason was interviewed for the book, but Rittgarn refused to speak to the authors without being paid. The book received mostly positive critical reviews, with Hamilton Cain of Star Tribune calling it an \\"instant true-crime classic\\". Emily Bazelon of The New York Times praised that the authors \\"tell their story plainly, expertly and well\\", and the style of alternating between Marie's story and the other Denver sexual assaults was praised by Claudie Rowe of The Seattle Times and Cain. However, though Rosita Boland of The Irish Times enjoyed the early sections of the book, she found it to have a \\"curiously flat style overall, without any distinctive voice\\". =Unbelievable= The Netflix miniseries Unbelievable is an eight-part adaptation of \\"An Unbelievable Story of Rape\\", also drawing from \\"An Anatomy of Doubt\\" and A False Report. It premiered on September 13, 2019. The main characters are based on Marie (Kaitlyn Dever), known in the series as Marie Adler, and Detectives Edna Hendershot and Stacy Galbraith, who were renamed as Grace Rasmussen (Toni Collette) and Karen Duvall (Merritt Wever). Marie, Armstrong and Miller were consulted during the production. Netflix reported that \\"Unbelievable\\" had garnered 32 million views by the end of September, where a \\"view\\" entailed watching at least 70% of an episode. This made it the seventh-most viewed television series on the platform from August 2018 to September 2019. The program was nominated for numerous awards, including four nominations each at the Golden Globe Awards and the Critics' Choice Television Awards, with one win at the latter. On Rotten Tomatoes, the series has a rating of 98%, based on 82 reviews, with the summary: \\"Heartbreaking and powerful, Unbelievable transcends familiar true- crime beats by shifting its gaze to survivors of abuse, telling their stories with grace and gravity.\\" On Metacritic, the program has a rating of 83 out of 100 based on 25 reviews, indicating universal acclaim.

In 1884, the two-year-old Tyrant was conditioned for racing on the Rancho Del Paso's three-quarter mile training track but it was decided that the colt was not yet ready for the rigors of competition and Tyrant only began his racing career as a three-year-old in 1885. Tyrant's easy win in the Withers Stakes marked the first time that a California horse with its California trainer had won a major race for three-year-olds on the East Coast. Racing at age four, Tyrant won the Distillers' Stakes at the Kentucky Association track in Lexington. Stud career Retired to stud at his owner's Rancho Del Paso, Tyrant met with limited success as a sire. Among his offspring, Tyrant's most successful runners included The Manxman, winner of the 1898 Carter Handicap.

He stayed in this position for six months and then left for a permanent mission at the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. The memoirs of his nine years at the State Department are found in his book \\"Ambassador Without Embassy, Lawyer Without Client\\", which describes his missions in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Canada, Malaysia and Kazakhstan. Afshari set out on the road to Damascus on the , about a month after Khalid of Saudi Arabia died and the beginning of Fahd of Saudi Arabia's reign. From July 1982, he was employed in the Iranian mission in Jeddah, a month earlier, on , Khalid of Saudi Arabia had died and Fahd of Saudi Arabia followed him on the throne. His autobiographical reminiscences, contains a chronicle of Iranian-Saudi-Arab relations: In 1933, Crown Prince Saud ibn Abd al-Aziz made an 8-day trip to Iran and met with Reza Shah Pahlavi. Between 1944 and 1948 diplomatic relations between the two governments were interrupted The Saudi religious police had arrested the Iranian pilgrim, Hajji Abu Talib al-Yazdi in the Grand Mosque in Mecca, accused him of throwing excrement on the Ka'bah, brought to justice, found guilty and beheaded. In 1948 diplomatic relations were resumed until 1979 with a delegation of goodwill. Ruhollah Khomeini had dialectically developed his idea of a theocracy from the Wahhabi real state. From 22 September 1980 to 20 August 1988 during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, Saddam Hussein relied on the full support of Fahd of Saudi Arabia. On May 7, 1984, allegedly four McDonnell F-4 fighter jets of the Iranian Air Force entered Saudi Arabia in an attack on an oil tanker in the Persian Gulf. On May 8, 1984, two Iranian fighters of same type of aircraft were shot down. Alaeddin Boroujerdi, the Iranian Charg√© d'affaires, intended for the post of Ambassador, was expelled. The Iranian government did not send whose language assets had been to poor to be designated as an diplomat. Power conservation interests led to the regulation of mutual pilgrimage. On July 31, 1987, 402 people lost their lives in conflicts between Iranian Hajjis and Saudi Arabian Crowd control (275 Iranians, 85 Saudis, including police, and 42 pilgrims from other states). On August 1, 1987, in Tehran, the Saudi embassy was raided, looted, illegally deprived of the presence of personnel, ill-treated, and the homes of Saudi diplomats attacked, resulting in a sarcastic officer dying of his injuries. The Iranian Charg√© d'Affaires in Riyadh, Hussein Sadeqi, was declared persona non grata and had to leave Saudi Arabia within 48 hours. In this situation, Parviz Afshari became Iranian charg√© d'affaires in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia). For the 1988 pilgrimage, the Saudi government cut the 150,000 to 45,000 visas for Iranian pilgrims to Mecca and broke diplomatic relations.Associated Press, 1987 Hajj Incident, But the Deputy Chief of Mission at the Iranian Embassy in Riyadh, Parviz Afshari, complained a heavy police guard was still stationed around his embassy premises.

While Kurdistan Region has a representation in Moscow, Russia has a consulate general in Erbil which opened on 28 November 2007. Relations between the Kurds and the Russians date back to the second half of the 1800s when Russian interest in Kurds because of expansionist ambitions. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union supported the Kurdish rebels against Iraq until the European power withdrew politically from the Middle East in the late 1970s because of the Middle-Eastern backlash from the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. After the Cold War, Russia established ties with the newly- founded autonomous Kurdistan Region and relations are described as ambivalent and contradictory but Moscow has been sympathetic to the Kurdistan independence movement for decades which also included military support for the Kurds. Today, the two parties mainly cooperate in the energy sector. Unlike most of the other European powers, Russia did not criticize the unilateral 2017 Kurdistan Region independence referendum and continued to invest in the Kurdish region despite growing tensions between Kurdistan and Iraq. This made analysts believe that Russia was attempting to fill the gap which America had created from its criticism of the referendum. Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Kurdish Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani in June 2017 and in May 2018. According to Kurdish officials, the Russian investments worth billions of dollars in the 2010s, prevented the Kurds from going bankrupt as a large portion of their budget went to the fight against ISIL. Kurdish-Soviet relations (1945-1980s) =Barzani's exile in Russia (1945-1958)= The Kurdish leader of the nationalist movement Mustafa Barzani went to exile in the Soviet Union in 1945 after the Kurdish rebellion was quelled and remained there for 13 years until he returned to Kurdistan in 1958 to resume the independence campaign. During his exile, he received an education and also established close ties to the KGB and the Russian Red Army which generated the belief among Americans that he was a Russian agent. Despite ideological differences and Barzani's nationalist ideology, the Soviets began supporting his men militarily throughout the 1960s and 1970s. During the Cold War, Barzani had close ties to the Soviet Union, believing that an independent Kurdistan could only be established with Soviet support. =Military assistance amid ambiguous relations (1958-1980)= Just one year after returning to kurdistan, Barzani returned to Moscow to hold talks with First Secretary Khrushchev wherein the Soviets uttered their support for Kurdish autonomy and willingness to support the Kurds militarily and financially. As Barzani returned from his trip to Russia, he began strengthening his grip on Kurdistan and defeated the Pro-Iraq Kurdish tribes. By 1961, the Kurdish rebels amounted to between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters as Iraq lost all influence in Iraqi Kurdistan. As Iraqi-Kurdish relations deteriorated, the Soviet support for the Kurds was delicate since Iraqi General Qasim was leaning towards communism and any antagonizing move would tilt Iraq towards the United States. When the Ba'athist coup of 1963 took place, the Soviet Union took the opportunity to pressure Iraq to recognize Kurdish rights which resulted in the Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish Autonomy Agreement of 1970 in which Baghdad would recognize Kurdish autonomy. However, with the failure of negotiations, the Soviets signed a friendship treaty with Iraq in April 1972 which shifted the Kurdish- Soviet relations to the worse in spite of a high-level meeting between the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in August 1972. After the treaty with Baghdad, Moscow stopped publicly mentioning the Kurds. In the second half of 1972, Kurdish and Russian media began a smear campaign against each other. In 1975, the Second Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish War ended when Iraqi forces crushed the Kurdish uprising with Soviet weapons. However, Soviet military support for the Kurds continued even after their collapse in 1975, as Mitrokhin documents confirm that Moscow aided the Kurds in the early 1980s. In the aftermath of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Moscow withdrew from the region politically because of criticism to the invasion. Russian return to Kurdistan (2003-) The American invasion of Iraq in 2003 made it possible for the Kurds and the Russians to open a new chapter in their relations. Russia became one of the first countries to open a representation in Kurdistan Region which was inaugurated in 2007, however relations remained unexploited due to fear of Turkish antagonism. The relations are mainly focused on the energy sector as Russian companies have invested billions of dollars in the region during the 2010s. In 2012, Gazprom and Kurdistan Region signed a contract for the exploration and oil production of two oil blocks which later rose to three oil blocks. In February 2017, Rosneft injected $2.1 billion dollars as Russia received its first 600,000 barrels of Kurdish oil in April 2017, while Gazprom signed an agreement with the Kurdish authorities in June 2017 worth $400 million. ISIL entering Iraq in the spring of 2014, prompted the World to deliver weapons to the Peshmerga. The Russian involvement in the equipping of the Kurdish soldiers was limited to three shipments in total. In the third dispatch, the Russians solely delivered five batches of the Soviet-era ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft. On the Russian approach to Kurdistan in the 2010s, Russian analyst Barmin argued that: Analyst Varfolomeeva argued that Russia needed Kurdistan to be viable to maintain its business relations and to not antagonize with the region which is why Russia did not criticize the referendum in 2017.

She is a physical scientist in the atmospheric chemistry and dynamics laboratory in the earth science division at Goddard Space Flight Center. Her research includes aerosol-cloud- chemistry-climate interactions. She received the NASA Exceptional Achievement Medal in 2005.  Early life and education  Chin was born in Shanghai, China. Beginning at the age of nine, Chin attended the Children's Music School at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music for three years to study piano. When she was thirteen, her education abruptly stopped due to the Cultural Revolution. After a little more than two years idling at school with chaos everywhere in China, Chin was sent to a farm in the very north of China near Siberia, three days away from Shanghai by train, as part of Mao Zedong's educated youth program. Many other children her age were sent there as well. More than forty children lived in one room. They each had a ‚Äúliving‚Äù space of two feet. She worked on that farm for nine years, until Chairman Mao's death, which ended the Cultural Revolution. For nine years, a Chin and group of other children quietly studied math, physics and chemistry. Her parents and friend's mother in Shanghai sent them textbooks and they taught themselves. At the farm, they had no phones. Electricity had to be turned off no later than 9 p.m., so they studied in the evenings with candlelight. In 1977, the National College Entrance Examination that were stopped during the Cultural Revolution, resumed. Chin had to take two college entrance exams, a preliminary and a final. Because of her studies at night, she passed the preliminary exam. After the preliminary test results came back, Chin was given two hours to choose a college and a major from the hand-written list posted on the walls inside a classroom in a local elementary school. She chose one college that was near her home in Shanghai as well as others in different places. Chin received a B.S. degree in chemistry from East China Normal University in 1982, a M.A. degree in chemistry from Ball State University in 1986, and a Ph.D. degree in Atmospheric Sciences from Georgia Tech in 1992. During her graduate study in Georgia Tech, Chin was involved in field experiments measuring atmospheric constituents, laboratory study determining atmospheric photochemical reaction rates and product yields, and one-dimensional photochemical model estimating stratospheric sulfur budget. Her dissertation was titled An atmospheric study of carbonyl sulfide and carbon disulfide and their relationship to stratospheric background sulfur aerosol. Chin's doctoral advisor was Paul Wine. Between 1992 and 1995, Chin was a postdoctoral fellow in the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences where she worked with 3-dimensional regional and global atmospheric chemistry and transport models for studying tropospheric ozone, aerosols, and trace gases.  Career  Chin was a Research Scientist at Universities Space Research Association from 1995 to 1997 and a Research Scientist/Senior Research Scientist at Georgia Institute of Technology from 1997 to 2003 before she joined the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in 2003, concentrating on atmospheric model development and satellite data analysis. Chin is a Physical Scientist in the Atmospheric Chemistry and Dynamics Laboratory, Earth Science Division, at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). = Research = Chin has served as principal investigator for many research projects since 1997 that involve global and regional modeling of tropospheric aerosols and chemistry. She and her coworkers have developed the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) model, which has been used to simulate tropospheric aerosols and related gas species, CO, and radionuclides for climate, air quality, and global change studies, with a spetial focus on analysis of satellite and sub-orbital observations. Chin's research at GSFC includes aerosol-cloud-chemistry-climate interactions, regional and global air quality, transport of aerosols and trace gases, aerosol impacts on global energy balance, and modeling and analysis of data from satellite, ground-based, and airborne observations.  Awards and honors  In 1997, Chin received the Editor's Citation for excellence in refereeing from the Journal of Geophysical Research. In 2005, she was awarded the exceptional achievement award and NASA Exceptional Achievement Medal from GSFC.

In 1773 a two- storey wing of stone rubble was constructed at the building's rear to hold a large dining room to provide meals and other services for visiting notables, with the kitchen and other offices below. This wing is now known as the Old Assembly Room and retains its plain 18th-century marble fireplace and paneling. The original early 18th-century jury benches survive while the Kings Arms were made by William Puckridge of London in 1743. Beneath this is the entrance to the town's Pannier Market. South Molton Museum South Molton Museum is located on the Guildhall's first floor and is managed by South Molton Town Council and volunteers. The Museum displays the social history of South Molton and its development across the centuries. The Museums's collections reflect the life and times of the historic market town and the surrounding district including two Town Charters, granted by Elizabeth I and Charles II, local archaeological finds, agricultural implements, items of domestic interest, textiles, documents, maps, toys, etc. Apart from the permanent exhibition there is also a regularly changing programme of displays.Home Page - South Molton Museum Displayed are the Newsham Fire Engine used in the town from 1736 to 1886 until it was replaced by the Merryweather Fire Engine which was still in use until the early 1930s and which is also displayed.South Molton and District Museum - Devon Museums website References Category:South Molton Category:Guildhalls in the United Kingdom Category:Buildings and structures in South Molton Category:1739 establishments in England Category:Grade I listed buildings in Devon ","title":"Guildhall, South Molton"},{"id":"61872197","text":"James Ostrer (born 1979) is a British photographer living in London.

Nerus was active in the political movements for the independence of Indonesia from 1920 until 1931. During this period, he established the Batak Karo Association in 1924, and joined the Indonesian National Party in 1930. His further activities caused him to be exiled in Boven-Digoel several times. During the Japanese occupation, he was freed, but later imprisoned again. During this time, he led the recruitment for the Heiho auxillay soldiers in the Karo area. After the independence of Indonesia, Nerus returned to his hometown, Kabanjahe, which at that time was in the state of East Sumatra. He was appointed as the head of the information affairs in Berastagi in 1947, and later as the member of the People's Representative Council of the United States of Indonesia in 1949, representing East Sumatra. After the dissolution of the parliament, he was seated in the Provisional People's Representative Council, as a member from the National People's Party. In the vice presidential election on 14 October 1950, Nerus nominated himself as a candidate. He only obtained 1 vote (allegedly from himself). During his term as a member of parliament, Nerus submitted a motion, along with other four members from the Democratic faction. The motion urged the government to give priority to the defense law over the other defenses, which, according to the initiators of the motion, are merely a consequence of the said main law. The motion furthermore calls for the discussion of the 5 bills concerning the army, which are currently being discussed, to be postponed pending the defense law. Nerus died on the night of 12 March 1955 at the Central Civil Hospital in Jakarta. He was buried at a public graveyard in Medan. After his death, the party nominated Bena Sitepu Pandebesi as his replacement. Pandebesi was inaugurated as the member of the People's Representative Council on 16 June 1955.

The divine force is born in the Kingdom of Sripuram, and is given the name Vaishnavi. On the birth of Vaishnavi, her father is called by the tridevi's in their lok. The tridevis tell Vaishanvi's father that Vaishanvi is not a oridnary human and her life has a goal which she has to complete. They tell him that when Vaishnavi is aware of her powers you have to let her take her own decisions and you won't interfere in any way. Vaishnavi's father agrees but when her mother Maharani Samridhi find about the promise her husband made to tridevi's, afraid of losing her only daughter she decides to keep her away from narayan temple in their palace. But eventually Vaishnavi sees the Vishnu temple and she realizes her powers. The shows follow a series of incidents where Vishnavi helps the people in her kingdom. It includes, mata rani's bhandara and defeating many asurs but with no violence because this is her goal that she has to finish the evil in humans not the humans. Later, the tridevis give different type of knowledge to Vaishnavi and revokes her inner powers.Later she goes on a meditation for several years in order to fully transform into a mata rani. Years later, Vaishnavi is grown up and she sets out to help her devotees. Bhaironath, a tantrik, is asked by his guru (his guru is a nice man) to find a divine energy he saw through his powers. Bhaironath sets out to find the energy but since he is very evil and looking for the energy who is none other than Vishnavi. He is not able to find her. When he finally sees her, he develops some feelings for her which are wrong and Vaishnavi warns him about the same but he does not listen at last Vishanvi beheads his head. Mahadev sets out to end the world as Vaishnavi killed Bhaironath and as the tridev's and tridevi's had a deal that if Vaishnavi kills anyone Mahadev will end the world. But Vaishanvi explains Mahadev that she didn't kil Bhaironath but gave him mukti and the reason behind beheading his head is that his head was full of arrogance and anger. Mahadev calms down. After this starts the journey of Mata rani and her devotees and how she helps her devotees.

It was selected as the Danish entry for the Best International Feature Film at the 92nd Academy Awards, but it was not nominated. The film won the 2019 Nordic Council Film Prize. Plot Anne is a lawyer working on the prosecution of a rape case. She is married to a physician, Peter, and they have two daughters, Frida and Fanny. Peter's teenage son from his past marriage is Gustav, who lives in Sweden with his mother Rebecca. The family plans for Gustav to move in with Anne and Peter. Gustav arrives but begins to conflict with Peter, pushing for the right to move out on his own despite being a minor. One day, Anne returns home to find there has been a break-in and burglary. The incident is reported to the police, but afterwards Anne finds an item in Gustav's laundry that was in her bag, stolen during the break-in. She realizes he was responsible for the robbery and confronts Gustav with the evidence. However, Anne promises to keep the matter a secret if Gustav does his part in the household. Time passes and one night, Gustav brings his girlfriend Amanda home. Anne hears the couple having sex and is aroused. Peter and Anne entertain guests on their balcony, but Anne leaves the group to take Gustav to a bar. There, she kisses him. Later, she enters his bedroom and the two have sex. The two begin a sexual relationship; during which, Gustav interviews Anne, asking her various questions including about her first sexual relationship. Anne says it was with someone she should not have had sex with, but she does not want to talk about it. The family celebrates Frida and Fanny's birthday. When Anne and Gustav step away, Gustav kisses her. A guest, Lina, witnesses the encounter and upset, leaves the party. Anne frets Lina will tell Peter, and breaks off her relationship with Gustav. Gustav and Peter leave to spend time at their cabin; Peter returns and tells Anne that Gustav wants to go to a boarding school, and Gustav and Anne had an affair. Anne angrily denies the accusation, saying Gustav hates her for ending Peter and Rebecca's marriage. She also tells Peter Gustav was responsible for the burglary. Anne, Peter and Gustav then sit down together, where Anne continues to deny the affair. Gustav threatens to report Anne for the affair, but she replies he is not a credible witness. Gustav is kicked out of the house but later goes missing from his school. A hunter discovers Gustav's body near the cabin, where he froze to death.

Location The Little Watshishou River originates in Lake Gallienne, and flows southwest to enter the Gulf of Saint Lawrence from the village of Baie-Johan-Beetz. The river flows through the unorganized territory of Lac-J√©r√¥me in Minganie Regional County Municipality. Lower down it flows through the municipality of Aguanish. The mouth of the river is in the municipality of Baie-Johan-Beetz, Minganie. Quebec Route 138 crosses the river near its mouth. The river is about long. It drains a watershed of . It lies between the basins of the Watshishou River to the west and the Pashashibou River to the east. The watershed contains the For√™t ancienne du Lac-Auger. The river roughly defines the boundary between the lower boreal biological zone to the north and the hemiarctic zone to the south. The river has moderate hydroelectric potential in its northern section. Name The topnym Watshishou is also used for the nearby Watshishou River. It is probably the same as the \\"R. Oueachechou\\" on Boish√©bert's 1715 map, and Oydchechou on Bellin's 1744 map. Later maps spell it Watcheeshoo, Watsheeshou, Watscheeshoo , Watsjishu and Watchichou. The Dictionary of Rivers and Lakes of the Province of Quebec (1914 and 1925) gives it as Watshishou. In the Innu language it means \\"white mountain\\" or \\"bright mountain\\". It probably refers to the landmark polished granite Watshishou Hill, high to the east of the mouth of the Watshishou River. Others say the word comes from watsh (mountain) and shu (small), meaning small mountain. Fishing Joseph Tanguay, originally from Berthier, settled at the Little Watshishou River in 1854. Tanguay and his sons fished mostly for salmon on the Corneille, Petite Watshishou, Watshishou and Quetachou rivers. In 1862 Tanguay moved to Baie Piashti, which was renamed Baie Johan-Beetz in 1925. Today the Baie-Johan-Beetz Outfitter supports fishing on the river, including for Atlantic salmon and landlocked salmon. There are seven fishing holes on the stream, which can be fished with waders or from a boat from mid-June to the end of August. The outfitter provides three chalets on the river between the highway and the Gulf. The Pourvoirie du Lac Holt also supports fishing on the river. The Little Watshishou River has icy, often tumultuous waters, with beautiful rapids and waterfalls. Fish species include Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), American eel (Anguilla rostrata) and ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius). Atlantic salmon use the last of the river, up to a waterfall that blocks their way. A 2018 North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization (NASCO) Rivers Database Report gave the status of the river as \\"Not Threatened With Loss\\". In May 2015 the Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks of Quebec announced a sport fishing catch-and-release program for large salmon on sixteen of Quebec's 118 salmon rivers. These were the Mitis, Laval, Pigou, Bouleau, aux Rochers, Jupitagon, Magpie, Saint-Jean, Corneille, Piashti, Watshishou, Little Watshishou, Nabisipi, Aguanish and Natashquan rivers. The Quebec Atlantic Salmon Federation said that the measures did not go nearly far enough in protecting salmon for future generations. In view of the rapidly declining Atlantic salmon population catch-and-release should have been implemented on all rivers apart from northern Quebec.
