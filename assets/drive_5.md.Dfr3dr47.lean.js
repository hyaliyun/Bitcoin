The GRUMEC was created in 1974 and is subordinate to the Submarine Force, which provides the primary means of transport for combat diver missions. GRUMEC teams can be transported to the target by a submarine, from which can reach the target by swimming, in kayaks, or in inflatable boats that can be launched from the submarine while it is still under water. The GRUMEC can also reach the target by parachute or helicopter. GRUMEC operators during ASPIRANTEX 2019. The function of the GRUMEC is to infiltrate undetected in coastal and riverine environments in order to perform tasks such as reconnaissance, sabotage and the elimination of targets of strategic value. In this sense it is similar to the U.S. Navy SEALs and British Special Boat Service. A member of the force is known as a \\"MEC\\", which is an abbreviation of \\"mergulhador de combate\\", meaning \\"combat diver\\". Formation A GRUMEC operator at the Jungle Warfare training. Reputed as one of the hardest in the world, the Brazilian Navy Combat Diver's indoctrination and training methods are similar to other combat diver units such as the American SEALs, British SBS (Special Boat Service) or the DINOPS (D√©tachement d'Intervention Operationelle Subaquatique) belonging to the French Foreign Legion. The course is conducted in the MEC Cry. For officers of the Navy, the initial requirements include passing medical and psychological examinations, testing in a recompression chamber and arduous physical tests. The call CAMECO (Enhancement Course for Officers Combat Diver) lasts 41 weeks, is divided into four phases and aims to enable the military to operate diving equipment, weapons, explosives, tactics and techniques used for unconventional warfare and conflict low intensity, enabling them to perform, in short, the various types of Special Operations. Officials, of course, special emphasis is given to planning operations, but as a whole, the materials include: physical training and military defense; hygiene and first aid campaign, self-contained open-circuit, fighting techniques, riverine operations, demolition, weapons, communications, shore reconnaissance, submarine special operations, military planning process and case study, contemporary management, leadership; introduction to microcomputers, communications system of the Navy, and Intelligence. For enlisted (corporals or male sergeants with less than 30 years of age and able to reenlist), there is a C-ESP-MEC - Special Course Combat Divers, whose requirements for admission are the same as CAMECO. The duration is 42 weeks of instructional activities also drawn as to the officers, but those who endure the enormous physical and mental pressure of the course will be adequately prepared for the specialized tasks assigned to MECS. Throughout the period of the course, candidates are submitted to MEC to extreme physical and psychological hardships, and emphasized the attributes of combat leadership, wisdom, objectivity, improvisation, serene environment when subjected to high risks or stress, among other. The weather is always kept as close as possible to what would be found in a real operational situation. The pressure is constant so that, typically, a group that started the course, only about 30 to 40 percent receive final approval and with it the coveted wings (badge). All applicants are volunteers and may request the termination of the activity at any time. Clam also gives the C-EXP-MAUT-GAS-Diver Course Expedito of Closed-Circuit, available for both official and squares that have been judged fit to psychophysical control annual swim (or equivalent examination) for less than one year. Its duration is four weeks and is open also for military Marine Corps, Army and Air Force. It is always important to emphasize that the techniques of closed-circuit scuba diving with equipment that does not produce bubbles, are essential for most jobs in special operations, thanks to the discretion, silence and invisibility of the virtual operators to visual observation and detection by the enemy. After graduating MEC, the military is called to serve in GruMeC, where he has a full complement of training program and conduct advanced courses and internships in various areas such as deactivation of explosive devices (EOD), basic skydiving (static line jump), jumpmaster, HALO jump, HALO jumpmaster, precursor paratrooper (PREC), folding, maintenance and supplies by air (DOMPSA) stage basic mountaineering course in jungle operations, operational stage in the Pantanal, stage sniper (sniper), among others.  Training and exchange  GRUMEC men during a training exercise. The day-to-day life for members of GruMeC constitutes a countless array of activities, and mixed among the inevitable administrative tasks, are training, retraining and exercise. In \\"Operation Dragon\\" they perform hydrographic reconnaissance and gather information about the surf, training of patrols, terrestrial orientation, infiltration dipped, parachute jumping (free, or semi-automatic), release and collection of personnel and materiel by helicopters, submarines and surface ships; In fact, the MECS have participated in all the Fleet amphibious operations in support of launching torpedoes and missiles, riverine operations in the Amazon and the Pantanal, as well as the constant exercise of recovery ships and oil platforms, \\"attacks \\"The ships of the Fleet Forces District, etc.. Aiming to keep up with the state of the art worldwide, the group has conducted exchanges with their counterparts in friendly countries. Among them Operation \\"Unitas\\", where they operated with the U.S. Navy SEALs. Chronology *1964: The first Brazilian MECs (Mergulhadores de Combate = Combat Divers) were two officers and two privates who had been through the USA UDT course. *1970: From their experience, the Divis√£o de Mergulhadores de Combate (= Combat Divers Division) was created in the \\"Base Almirante Castro e Silva\\". *1971: Two more officers and three privates qualified for the French Navy as \\"nageurs de combat\\". *1974: At what is now the Centro de Instru√ß√£o e Adestramento Almirante √Åttila Monteiro Ach√© (CIAMA) in Brazil was trained the first group of combat divers. *1983: Because this frogman unit were getting more calls, Combat Divers Division was transformed into GRUMEC, as an integral part of the Comando da For√ßa de Submarinos (= Submarine Force Command). *1997 December 12: The Minister of the Navy created GRUMEC, whose headquarters are in Rio de Janeiro city and is directly subordinate to the Submarine Force Command. *1998 March 10: GRUMEC was activated.

The IUCN has classed Brugmansia arborea as Extinct in the Wild. Description Brugmansia arborea is an evergreen shrub or small tree reaching up to in height. The ovate leaves have coarsely toothed margins when in their best condition. The leaves, flower stalks, fruit, and especially the young shoots are covered with fine velvety white down. Flowers are strongly fragrant, trumpet-shaped, nodding to sub-horizontal, white to ivory- white or cream. At long, the flowers are the shortest of all Brugmansia. Flowers are produced almost continuously in smaller quantities, unlike many other Brugmansia that flower in larger flushes. The ovoid fruit have an average length of and width of . The calyx is slit along one side and is very long in relation to the flower, and in this respect is often used as a quick check to verify correct identification. With a few exceptions, the green calyx usually reaches down almost all the way to the flower corolla's mouth. Taxonomy Type specimen of Brugmansia arborea In his 1753 Species Plantarum, Carl Linnaeus published Datura arborea using as his type specimen a drawing by Louis Feuill√©e from 1714 with name Stramonioides arboreum, oblongo et integro folio, fructu laevi, vulgo Flori pondio. Then Robert Sweet, in his 1818 Hortus Suburbanus Londinensis, published the modern version of the name to be in the separate genus of Brugmansia. Since then, many authors have published many different plants with one of those names, causing much confusion in the taxonomy of these plants. \\"Datura arborea\\" has many times been incorrectly used for almost any white-flowered Brugmansia plant, even in scientific literature. Distribution and habitat They are native to the Andes mountains of southern Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, western Bolivia, and northern Chile. As the hardiest of all Brugmansia species in regards to both cold and drought, they are often found in the drier valleys of the Andes, in areas with an annual rainfall of . Occurring at elevations of 2000 to 3000 m, they often receive light frosts. Ecology Brugmansia arborea are usually pollinated by moths. They are attracted by the white color of the flowers and their fragrance that gets stronger in the evenings. The species is invasive in New Caledonia.

It is a tributary of the Avon River, taking water from two of the Avon's sub- catchments, the Yilgarn River and the Lockhart River, from their junction where it passes through a hydrological-topographical pinch-point at 'Caroline Gap'. From here it flows south-west past Quairading, about before discharging into the Yenyening Lakes northeast of Brookton. These in turn discharge into the Avon River, which discharges into the Swan River and its estuary, which discharges into the Indian Ocean. Salt River, and all its tributaries, is a saline river system comprising a chain of salt lakes. Its southern, Lockhart tributaries arise in the vicinity of Lake Grace, Newdegate and Lake King, whilst its Yilgarn tributaries arise north and east of Southern Cross, and near Merredin and Kellerberrin. Loosely, the term 'Salt River' applies to all of these tributaries. The system has a very low gradient, estimated at around 30 centimetres fall per kilometre. In many places it is essentially flat, and in these places it forms relatively large salt-lakes that hold large amounts of water before eventually filling and overflowing. Thus the Salt River does not flow all at once, other than during periods of prolonged or extreme rainfall. Rather, each component rotates through a cycle of filling and overflowing, influenced by cycles further upstream. Waterway assessments The river was extensively surveyed in 2008.

This album is the band's first without long-time guitarist David Soloway since 1998, and their first with guitarist Arun Bali and bass guitarist Rodrigo Palma. The album also features Spencer Peterson on drums for the first time, before leaving the band prior to the album's release. Background When pre- orders were posted for Under the Boards in 2007, listings mentioned that Saves the Day would be releasing an album in 2008 dubbed Daybreak. In late 2007, vocalist/guitarist Chris Conley and guitarist David Soloway worked with Say Anything vocalist Max Bemis and drummer Coby Linder for the side project Two Tongues. On April 11, 2008, it was revealed that Daybreak would be released around the Christmas period. The group worked on Daybreak in mid-2008. A video of the band playing a new track titled \\"Daybreak\\" was posted online on October 29. In November, alongside the announcement of Two Tongues' debut album, it was revealed that Daybreak would be released at some point in 2009 through independent label Vagrant Records. In February and March 2009, the band toured Australia as part of the Soundwave festival with guitarist Thomas Hunter of Forgive Durden. On February 27, it was reported that Soloway had left the band. Soloway said he decided that it was time for him to leave the group, something he called \\"one of the most difficult decisions I've ever had to make.\\" On April 13, it was announced that Arun Bali had joined the band as their new guitarist. Bali was asked by long-time friend drummer Durijah Lang if he would play with the band for their upcoming tour. After bonding with Conley over their mutual interest in the Beatles and Big Star, Bali was invited to join the band full-time. Shortly afterwards, the band went on tour with Alkaline Trio, which ended in mid-May. Recording and composition Following the conclusion of the Alkaline Trio tour, the group entered the studio. Pre-production started in late May. In August, they were tracking guitars and vocals. By September, the group were listening to rough mixes of the album. On December 20, it was announced that bassist Manuel Carrero and Lang had left the band to join Glassjaw. They were replaced by Rodrigo Palma and Spencer Peterson, on bass and drums respectively. Bali had been friends with Palma since school and had appeared in bands with him previously. The group knew Peterson through a mutual friend. Following a support slot for New Found Glory in early 2010, the band entered the studio on April 1. The group announced they were tracking drums on April 13. The album was mixed in September. Daybreak is the third album of a trilogy, preceded by Sound the Alarm (2006) and Under the Boards (2007). Conley said that Sound the Alarm was \\"an expression of discontent. Under the Boards is reflection and remorse. Daybreak is acceptance\\". Conley also said that the three-album concept was \\"just a bit of a therapeutic experiment. I felt like all twisted up and broken inside and just angry and confused and depressed and sad and I couldn‚Äôt really deal with the world or myself. So I was just like this has got to end, I have to at least try and get a grip on the world and on myself. So I dove into the depths of my mind and brought out what I was finding ... Daybreak is coming to terms with everything and trying to understand why I actually got that way and learning to accept it by exploring what it is and why it was there and simultaneously trying to grow through it and be a better person, not purely full of anger\\". Conley compared \\"Chameleon\\" to the \\"trippier aspects\\" of In Reverie (2003). Release On September 11, 2010, it was announced that Claudio Rivera was drumming for the band. A day later, Bali said that Daybreak would not be released in 2010. In late September and early October, the band played a few headlining shows. Following this, the band supported Motion City Soundtrack and Say Anything on their co-headlining US tour. On November 23, the group posted an acoustic version of \\"Let It All Go\\" as a free download through their Facebook profile. On January 19, 2011, Conley revealed that the album would be released in the spring/summer time. On January 24, \\"1984\\" was posted online. On March 7, it was announced that the band had signed to independent label Razor & Tie. On May 31, Daybreak was announced for release. On the same day, the band released the first single from the album, \\"Living Without Love\\". A day later, the track was released as a free download from the group's website. On June 6, the album's artwork was revealed and a new song was made available, \\"Undress Me\\". In June, the band went on a co-headlining US tour with the Get Up Kids. On July 9, the band filmed a music video for \\"Deranged & Desperate\\". Daybreak was released through Razor & Tie on September 13. The iTunes edition featured two bonus tracks and a making-of documentary, while the f.y.e. edition featured an acoustic version of the album in its entirety. In October and November, the band went on a co-headlining US tour with Bayside, with support from I Am the Avalanche and Transit. To coincide with the tour, the four groups each contributed one track to a four-way split single. Saves the Day's contribution was an acoustic cover of \\"Jinx Removing\\" by Jawbreaker. In November and December, the band performed a few co- headlining shows with Yellowcard in the UK. In August 2012, the band went on a tour of the UK.

San Marino (application No. 24645/94) was a case decided by the European Court of Human Rights in 1999. Facts The applicants, Cristoforo Buscarini and Emilio Della Balda, were elected to the General Grand Council (the parliament of the Republic of San Marino) in 1993. They requested permission from the Captains-Regent to take the oath required by the Elections Act without reference to any religious text. The Act referred to a decree of 27 June 1909, which laid down the wording of the oath to be taken by members of the parliament as follows: \\"I, ‚Ä¶, swear on the Holy Gospels [..]\\". The applicants originally took the oath in writing, omitting the reference to Gospels. Their oath was considered invalid, and the applicants took the oath on the Gospels, maintaining their protest. Proceedings and judgment In 1997, the European Court of Human Rights concluded unanimously that there had been a violation of Article 9. Sammarinese government maintained that the reaffirmation of traditional values represented by the taking of the oath was necessary in order to maintain public order. The Court concluded that requiring the applicants to take the oath on the Gospels was tantamount to requiring two elected representatives of the people to swear allegiance to a particular religion, a requirement which is not compatible with Article 9 of the Convention. As the ECtHR rightly stated in its report, it would be contradictory to make the exercise of a mandate intended to represent different views of society within Parliament subject to a prior declaration of commitment to a particular set of beliefs (Para. 39). The Court unanimously held that there was a violation of Article 9 of the ECHR (freedom of conscience).

They could trace their origins to 1759, when they were raised as the 16th Battalion Coast Sepoys. History The regiments first battle was the Battle of Sholinghur in 1781, during the Second Anglo-Mysore War. They were next involved in the Battle of Ava during the First Burmese War. During the Indian Mutiny of 1857 they were stationed in Hong Kong and Singapore. Their next action was during the Third Burmese War. With the defeat of King Thibaw Min the regiment remained in Burma, being renamed the 2nd Burma Battalion in 1891.Sharma, p.21 This transferral of six regiments of the Madras line to Burma Battalions was intended to provide permanent garrisons for the newly acquired territory. It was also part of a deliberate policy by General Sir Frederick Roberts to reduce the Madrasi element in the Indian Army and replace them with northern recruits from the Punjab. The title of the regiment subsequently underwent a number of changes but as late as 1914 its regimental centre remained Mandalay. During World War I they were deployed along the North West Frontier with the 1st (Peshawar) Division to prevent incursions by the Afghan tribes, but they were later sent to Egypt and Palestine and took part in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign attached to the 75th Division.Sharma, p.23 After World War I the Indian government reformed the army moving from single battalion regiments to multi battalion regiments.Sumner p.15 In 1922, the 72nd Punjabis became the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Punjab Regiment.Sharma, p.24 After independence they were one of the regiments allocated to the Indian Army.Sharma, p.28 Predecessor names *16th Battalion Coast Sepoys - 1759 *13th Carnatic Battalion - 1769 *12th Carnatic Battalion - 1770 *12th Madras Battalion - 1784 *2nd Battalion, 8th Madras Native Infantry - 1796 *12th Madras Native Infantry - 1824 *2nd Burma Infantry - 1890 *12th Regiment (2nd Burma Battalion) Madras Infantry - 1891 *12th Burma Infantry - 1901 *72nd Punjabis - 1903 Composition Recruited from Madrasis during its history prior to 1890, the regiment underwent substantial changes after that year. The senior Indian position of subadar-major was filled by a Sikh and the Madrasi rank and file were replaced by Pathans, Punjabis, Mussalmans and Sikhs. In 1903 the 12th lost its status as a Madras/Burma Infantry unit and was formally designated as a Punjabi regiment (see above). ReferencesSources  * *Moberly, F.J. (1923).

Organizational structure The Orchid Conservation Coalition‚Äôs structure is unique for a non-profit. It does not take contributions or distribute money itself. The member organizations in the coalition give directly towards orchid conservation. There is no fee to participate in the OCC. There are no board members. There are no decisions to be made because the organization is structured around agreements, and no money coming in to account for. No money means no need to incorporate. No donations accepted means no tax status. The OCC was structured this way to eliminate cost and to direct energy and money directly to orchid conservation. The Orchid Conservation Coalition is a coalition of orchid societies, businesses, and non profit conservation organizations. The keyword is coalition. The coalition revolves around a set of agreements which are opt in or opt out. For orchid societies and small businesses the agreements are good faith. All the decision making is left to the boards of participating orchid societies and the small business owners. For large businesses, the agreement is a legally binding agreement. For non profit conservation organizations the agreement is good faith with the understanding that the organization will be transparent with the funds received through 1% for Orchid Conservation and update participants with their progress. The Orchid Conservation Coalition does not have a physical space beyond its internet site.

Businesses: Orchid Seedbank Project, The Calypso Orchid Company, and Spangle Creek Labs Orchids as a Flagship Species for Conservation Orchids are a good flagship species for habitat preservation because they are one of the largest groups of plants on earth with about 25,000 species. They are found on all continents, except for Antarctica. Orchids are niche habitat players and are often found in unique habitats. They are \\"canaries in a coal mine\\" for the health of such habitats. The general public has a degree of fascination for orchids. The flashiness of orchids helps to protect habitat of less \\"flashy\\" but equally endangered species that share the same habitat. History The OCC is a non-profit coalition started in August, 2005. The beginning members were of the Orchid Seedbank Project and the San Francisco Orchid Society. The Species Society of Western Australia joined shortly thereafter in 2005.

He was named one of the one hundred most important leaders in Library Science by the American Libraries journal in 1999.\\"100 of the most important leaders we had in the 20th century\\" (1999). American Libraries, 30 (11), 39. Sydney Mitchell was much more than a librarian and more than the founder of one of the first Masters in Library Science degree programs in the early part of the twentieth century. His love of his hobby, gardening, motivated him to advocate the importance of not focusing only on one‚Äôs career. He is remembered in the field of horticulture just as much as in the profession of librarianship. Biography=Early life Mitchell was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1878. His degrees included a Bachelor of Arts and a master's degree in Literature from McGill University. He received an honorary Doctor of Literature degree from Occidental College. He studied Library Science at the New York State Library School. Lawrence Clark Powell Mitchell remained fluent in both French and English, having spent his boyhood in a predominantly French Canadian neighbourhood. Mitchell‚Äôs boyhood is discussed in great detail in his memoirs, which unfinished at his death, was published posthumously by his wife and his close personal friend, Lawrence Clark Powell, who wrote the preface. His memoir features stories of the neighborhood and fellow playmates, vividly describing the life of a normal boy in the streets of the nonindustrial age (born 1878) and fail to describe the difficulties that might have haunted him, having been born with a physical disability which at times caused him to spend long periods of time hospitalized and be categorized as crippled. Reportedly, never dropping into a self-pitying mode, he did not appear to have ever have seen himself as disabled. .Mitchell, S. B. Mitchell of California: the memoirs of Sydney B. Mitchell, librarian, teacher, gardener Library career Among his accomplishments was holding both the Presidency of the California Library Association (1938‚Äì1939) and the California Horticultural Society (1933‚Äì1945). During those early years in the development of the first master's degree in librarianship at the University of California, Berkeley, it is estimated that he earned more income from practice of his hobby and authoring of several volumes on the topic, than he did in his prestigious university appointment in librarianship.Brundin, R. E. (1994) \\"Sydney B. Mitchell and the Establishment of Graduate Education for Librarianship\\". Libraries and Culture, XXXIX (Spring 1994), 166-185 Mitchell began his work in California at Stanford University. He moved to the University of California, Berkeley in 1911 to head the purchasing department for the University Library. During World War I he was Acting Librarian at the University. In 1924, he was named Department Chair, the first director for that department. Three years later he was named Director of the School of Librarianship. He served in that capacity where, in 1926, he founded the nation‚Äôs third graduate program in Library Science west of the Mississippi. He was named Dean of the University in 1944 and held the office until his retirement two years later. He served as advisory editor to The Library Quarterly journal, Executive board member of the American Library Association, Vice President of the California Library Association, President of the Association of Library Schools and Fellow of the American Library Institute. Much writing about Sydney Mitchell points to his humanitarian efforts with regard to students and fellow library organizations. It appears he maintained a somewhat open door policy with profound ability to remember his students in regard to both their academic and personality profiles. His advice was frequently sought and followed to individual success by both those planning their careers and those who sought individuals to fill library positions. While Mitchell appeared to have comfortable relations with all those he encountered, one rivalry was significant. When Mitchell came to work at Berkeley after having spent three years in a library administrative position, his supervisor, Harold Leupp, was too close in age and credentials to assume a mentorship or successive opportunity. The conflict brings Mitchell to the point where he determines to carve out his own path with the university through his interest and dedication to the idea of improving the education and professionalism of the field. Mitchell was successful in obtaining University Regent approval for establishment of Librarianship in postgraduate study. Previously undergraduate classes and offerings at public libraries had been the practice. In 1926 Mitchell proceeded to create a certification for one year‚Äôs study in the basics of librarianship and a master's degree for second year study which focused on different types of libraries and one‚Äôs specialized interests. Although he had achieved the first stages of his goal, in a setting he has come to love, he was attracted by an offer from the University of Michigan, which was initiated due to his growing reputation of respect and esteem from fellow academic librarians. Taking a sabbatical from his California home, he obtained the tools necessary to further distinguish himself and provide the winning hand in a bid for an increased prestigious position with the west-coast university. He returned the following year, 1927, with permanent appointment as Director of the School of Librarianship at Berkeley where he remained until his retirement in 1945. Family and horticultural interests His San Francisco Bay Area home and esteemed gardens served as a backdrop for frequent visitors to the three acre home shared with his lifelong love and wife, Rose Michael, also a native of Quebec and a librarian in practice .Powell, L. (1954) \\"Mitchell of California\\". Wilson Library Bulletin (R), 28, 778-81. Retrieved October 24, 2009, from Library Lit & Inf Science Retro database A lifelong love of the Iris flower, in addition to his presidency with the California Horticultural Society, provided him the editorship of Sunset and authorship of four books on gardening. Mitchell helped organize the American Iris Society, whose Sydney B. Mitchell Medal, the highest award for Pacific Coast irises, is named for him,Mahan, C. (2009, August 2009).

While his physical appearance might have caused initial surprise, due to a somewhat frumpy wardrobe and unique gait, accounts of his great compassion and interest in others, his broad awareness of the world beyond the borders of his home and work, and his ability to see all sides of argument and decision made him one whose physical appearance was quickly forgotten when engaged in entertaining conversation. He died at home in September 1951.

The game is set in an ancient Oriental world with a Martial Arts theme. Martial Heroes was released in 2004 and was closed October 1, 2010. Although the official server has been closed, the protocol has been reverse engineered and a fully functional stable server is still operating with an active player base. In fact, it even includes new backported features from the Korean version of the game that previously weren't available on the official European server. https://brightmh.com/  Guilds  Different from other major MMORPGs, players throw the stone in the monsters face certain requirements before joining a guild. They have to be of a certain level and may need in-game money to finish a quest before they can join a guild in the game. There are many different types of guilds a player is able to create or join. This ability depends on the level the player is, the amount in-game money needed and/or successful completion of a certain quest. A player can become a MUN Master by being over level 48 with 4000 fame and it costs 100 gold. As a MUN master a player are given extra guild functions like ‚Äòguild mark‚Äô and ‚Äòdonations function‚Äô. MUN master guilds can be part of a guild war. They can take strong points in the area and hold positions for certain advantages. If you are advanced player (48lvl+) you can upgrade your guild to GYO level and after that to PYO but you need to destroy guild stone that is respawned by time, to do this you need strong members because you are not the only person who want it and your guild must be at grade 6 or less.  Guild areas  If an area is not yet claimed by a guild owner, it is called a free zone and every guild above level 10 can claim that area by using a Mahesty stone near an area stone. Area stones can only be awakened by MUN masters. Guilds can steal an area from another guild by declaring war to the area owner during guild war. Guild war occurs every 2 weeks. By owning a guild stone the guild gets certain advantages like increased attack power points, defense points, mana points, health points, attack success rate and final attack rate increased by a certain rate.  Fame system From level 36 a player can receive fame. With fame points you can view other players reputation, where reputation can be gain or lost depending on your actions. A player can gain fame by hitting the game master, and kill some npc. Depending on the amount of fame a player receives a nickname, depending on the faction the player has joined. The top 50 players of each faction will receive a special ranking, called face palm ranking. Face palm ranking is calculated by the amount of fame a player has accumulated versus other players fame count. The special rank will be shown by a tag above the character name. When not logged in the game for three months, players will be removed from the ranking system. Also you can use your fame to switch off your bad karma reputation called \\"KAO\\" which is given by attacking defendless players in normal world excluding Dead Land that is made for pvp between lawful faction and evil faction.  Characters  There are four kinds of characters: warrior, assassin, mage and monk. Warrior: The warrior class is the standard strength class and used in close combat fighting. Their main weapons include scimitars, the axe and spears. Warriors focus more on vitality, strength and dexterity Assassin: The assassin is the focused on quick attacks and the only female class in the game. Their main weapons include a bow, claw and a dagger. Assassins focus more on strength, agility, and dexterity. Mage: The mage is specialized in Magic Martial Arts but are also able to wield weapons. Their primary weapons include swords, fighting fans and Gauntlets. Mages focus on dexterity, agility, and intelligence. Monk: The monk class can specialize in many different Martial Arts like blessings and healing but also offense martial arts by using a staff. The Monk uses rods, wheels or a plummet and prefers to use protection skills. Monks focus on dexterity, intelligence, and vitality.

Gigolo was euthanized in 2009 after being injured, but is known today as history's most successful dressage horse. Early life The liver chestnut Hanoverian gelding was bred in 1983 by Horst Klussmann. His sire was Graditz and his dam was Bunett (his dam's sire was Busoni xx). In 1989, Werth's then-trainer Uwe Schulten-Baumer purchased Gigolo. Competitive career Gigolo and Werth competed in their first Olympic Games in 1992 at the Barcelona Games. There, the pair took an individual silver, while helping the German team to a gold medal. At the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, they repeated the team performance, while improving to take the individual gold medal. In 2000, at the Sydney Games, the helped the German team to a third gold medal, while again taking the individual silver. After the Sydney Games, Werth replaced Gigolo with Satchmo as her Olympic horse, although the pair didn't compete until the 2008 Games. Gigolo and Werth also competed in two World Equestrian Games. The first, the 1994 The Hague Games, resulted in both individual and team gold for the pair, as did the second, the 1998 Rome Games.

Decision The commission considered that a State [..] is entitled to convey, in an objective, but critical manner, information on religious communities and sects, if such information does not pursue aims of agitation or indoctrination endangering the freedom of religion and that the reference to the applicant association in the intended publication does not have any direct repercussions on the religious freedom of the association or its members.

Direct-to-fan is also becoming a model used by the broad definition of artists, including comedians, visual artists, and other entertainers looking to build and leverage a fan community throughout their career. The direct-to-fan model bypasses the major record label model that historically controlled radio, venue, and distribution channels, and lets the artist (or the team that supports that musician) create interest in their music directly with their fans, identify those fans, market directly to and develop relationships with those fans, sell directly to and monetize those relationships, and use those relationships to expand their fan base. Foundation components of this model include music discovery sites, and direct- to-fan music sales, marketing, and business solutions. Direct-to-fan models encourage engaging directly between the artist and their fans, keeping the fans engaged, knowing who they are (who, what, when, where, why), building the artist's brand, and developing the artist-to-fan relationship over time. Background An early example of this method in the music industry was by the British rock band Marillion, who used the internet to connect with their fans to finance a North American tour in 1997 and a subsequent album in 2001, instead of signing to a record label. In 2008, Alexis Petridis described the band in The Guardian as \\"the undisputed pioneers\\" of this practice. It was also addressed by Michael Lewis in his book Next: The Future Just Happened. Tools Some tools supporting direct-to-fan include: storefronts to sell direct-to-fan on band websites and on social networking sites such as Facebook or MySpace, Widget tools to embed sales, gig or event calendar, profile info anywhere including blogs, Marketing tools such as email marketing and messaging, Event tools, Central Content Management tools, Central Catalog Management tools for both digital and physical products, and digital delivery platforms that make it easy for you to sell direct from your website or social media by integrating with payment gateways, providing a checkout and automatically delivering music to fans via a download link. Sales, marketing, and business solutions More complete, one-place-to-manage- everything direct-to-fan solutions are beginning to emerge. They help the artist's team with fan management, brand management, sales, marketing, distribution, manufacturing, event management, merchandizing, warehousing, fulfillment, and more, all from one dashboard. Solution example An example of a direct-to-fan solution would have online storefronts for their official band websites, Facebook, MySpace, blogs, etc.; Marketing solutions for email marketing, fan capture, fan messaging, and fan management; Label services including digital distribution to iTunes, Amazon, and other retail sites, CD and DVD manufacturing, custom merch, print services, graphic design and web services, warehousing and fulfilment, backend ecommerce and payment processing, and more. Core applications that assist musicians in implementing a direct-to-fan approach include: * Fan community platforms *Band website and storefronts * digital delivery companies * CD/DVD manufacturing * Digital music distribution * Download cards * E-tickets and mobile-tickets * Fan email marketing and messaging * Fan marketing solutions * Merchandise * Music discovery * Music festival submissions * Payment processing * Physical warehousing and fulfillment * Poster and print services * Storefronts * Pre- sale ticket and album options * Integration of social sites, such as Facebook and Twitter * Fan-funding capabilities Companies that are delivering portions of the above direct-to-fan solution include: Bandcamp, Bandsintown, Shopify, Cafe Press, CD Baby, Constant Contact, Music Glue, Nimbit, NoiseTrade, Pledgemusic, ReverbNation, TuneCore, Zazzle, GigRev See also * Crowdfunding * Fan-funded music References *Mike King, NARM / A2IM Keynote \\"Direct to Fan: From Foundation to Execution\\" 5 October 2011 *Carl Jacobson, ASCAP \\"Direct-to-Fan: Hitting Your True Potential\\" 12/2010 *Bob Lefsetz, Today's Music Business Paradigm, 12/17/10 *Nimbit, Direct-to-Fan University, 06/01/10 *Solutions for Dreamers, \\"Comparing Services of Direct- to-Fan Platforms\\" 04/12/10 *Hype Genius, Direct-to-Fan Solution Analysis, 04/12/10 *Rick Goetz, Musician Coaching, \\"Direct-to-Fan Strategies\\" 12/23/09 *Michael Corcoran, American Statesman, Austin360, 10/01/09 *Bruce Houghton, Hypebot Blog, 09/16/09 *Laurence Tiffon, The Value of a Fan, 09/30/09 *Michael Masnick, Techdirt, 08/28/09 *Jason Feinberg, PBS Mediashift, 08/18/09 *Mike King, 8/31/09, AmericanSongwriter.com *Jason Feinberg, PBS Mediashift, 06/24/09 *Bruce Houghton, WebProNews.com, 5/4/09 *Mike King, Berklee Music Blog, 04/16/09 *Rueters/Billboard, Direct to Fan Presence, 03/26/07 Category:Music industry ","title":"Direct-to-fan"},{"id":"24502346","text":"Tropical Storm Christine was the easternmost forming Atlantic tropical cyclone on record until Subtropical Storm Alpha in 2020. Forming as a tropical depression over the country of Guinea on August 25, 1973, the system tracked nearly due west for several days before intensifying into a tropical storm on August 28\\\\. However, the National Hurricane Center did not issue their first advisory on the system until its intensity was confirmed by a reconnaissance aircraft on August 30\\\\. Turning slightly northward, Christine gradually intensified, attaining its peak strength on September 2\\\\. At that time, the storm had winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 996 mbar (hPa; 29.41 inHg), just below hurricane status. Shortly after, increasing wind shear caused the system to quickly weaken. By September 4, Christine had been downgraded to a tropical depression as it tracked through the Leeward Islands. After degenerating into a tropical wave, the cyclone's remnants fully dissipated on September 6\\\\. Although Christine had weakened to a tropical depression by the time it passed through the Leeward Islands, heavy rains from the storm, peaking at , caused flooding in Puerto Rico. Over 600 homes were flooded and dozens of families had to be evacuated from several towns. One person died from electrocution after stepping on a downed wire on a flooded street. Minor damage was recorded in the Virgin Islands, mainly downed power lines which left roughly 500 people without telephone service. Meteorological history alt=Map of a track through a portion of the Atlantic Ocean. The track spans from western Africa to the eastern Caribbean Sea. Northeastern South America can be seen in the bottom left of the image. Tropical Storm Christine originated from a tropical wave over Africa in late- August. As it neared the Atlantic Ocean, the wave spawned a tropical depression at 14.0¬∞W, over the country of Guinea, on August 25. The formation of this depression was farther east than any other tropical cyclone on record in the Atlantic hurricane basin, although storms may have gone undetected prior to the start of satellite imagery in the 1960s. This record would not be approached by any other storm until Subtropical Storm Alpha in 2020, which formed at 9.3¬∞W. This was unlike most cyclone producing waves which travel several hundred miles over water before spawning a depression. Tracking nearly due west, the depression moved over water several hours later and bypassed the Cape Verde Islands on August 27. The following day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm; however, advisories were not issued by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) on the system until August 30 because of the lack of reconnaissance aircraft data. It was determined that Christine had become a tropical storm by this time after receiving reports of gale-force winds from a German cargo ship in the vicinity of the storm. The first advisory from the NHC came after a reconnaissance plane found sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1007 mbar (hPa; 29.74 inHg). At that time, Christine was located roughly 1000 mi (1,500 km) east of Trinidad. Although the storm was relatively disorganized by this point, satellite imagery showed large outer bands extending hundreds of miles (kilometres) from the storm. By August 31, the storm began to slow and turn towards the west-northwest. The NHC noted that they did not have a firm grip on the storm and were unsure of its future track and intensity. Below average sea surface temperatures ahead of the system would hamper significant development. Continuing on this track, Christine gradually intensified and on September 2, the storm attained its peak intensity just below hurricane-status while situated roughly 300 mi (500 km) east of Guadeloupe. At this time, a reconnaissance aircraft recorded sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 996 mbar (hPa; 29.41 inHg). Shortly after Christine attained this intensity, increasing wind shear caused the storm to weaken as it neared the Leeward Islands. The NHC noted that a trough ahead of Christine would determine the future of the storm. This trough would either merge with the storm and allow significant intensification, or remain separate and cause Christine to dissipate. By September 3, the low-level circulation had been displaced from all convective activity and Christine weakened to a tropical depression. Several hours after weakening, the depression passed over Antigua with winds of 35 mph (55 km/h). The following day, the system degenerated into a tropical wave near the northeastern coast of the Dominican Republic. The remnants of Christine were monitored by the NHC for several days before dissipating near the trough on September 6. Observation Throughout its existence, Christine was monitored by astronauts in the Skylab 3 project.Shayler, p. 267 During this project, active and passive microwave satellite imagery was used for the first time to determine the wind speed within a tropical cyclone. This was accomplished after the removal of regions of heavy rain from the data, a factor that gives inaccurate wind readings.Saltzman, p. 207 Preparations and impact alt=Map of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands depicting rainfall amounts by colors. The heaviest amounts, shown in purple, are centered over eastern Puerto Rico. On September 2, the National Hurricane Center issued gale warnings and hurricane watches for Guadeloupe, Desirade, Antigua and Barbuda. Later that day, the gale warnings were expanded southward to include islands north of Dominica. After Christine weakened to a tropical depression, the NHC discontinued all watches and warnings for the Leeward Islands. Schools were closed in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands as a precaution. Six scientists had to be evacuated from the small island of Aves once the storm posed a threat to them. On St. Thomas, nine emergency shelters were opened, mainly in schools. On September 5, an emergency meeting was held by disaster officials in Puerto Rico about the threat of flooding from Christine. All residents were urged by government officials to have their disaster kits ready and be prepared to evacuate if told to do so. Firefighters, on and off- duty, were advised about the possibility of evacuations and would be pulled into work if needed. During its passage through the Leeward Islands, Christine produced torrential rainfall, peaking at in eastern Puerto Rico. A maximum of also fell in the United States Virgin Islands. Rainfall totals on other islands are unknown but are likely similar to those in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The precipitation led to flooding on several islands. One person was killed during the storm after being electrocuted by a downed power line on a flooded road. Public works crews worked throughout the storm to keep roads clear; however, one road that was under construction became a \\"sea of mud\\" as crews could not clear the flood waters fast enough. The towns of Yabucoa, Humacao, Maunabo, Las Piedras and Carolinas sustained flood damage from the storm. In Yabucoa, 40 families were evacuated as 25 homes were damaged. The most substantial flooding took place in Humacao where 60 families were evacuated and 500 homes sustained damage. A total of six bridges, four sewer systems and 14 homes were damaged in Maunabo. An additional 21 people were evacuated from Las Piedras and 41 homes were damaged and in Carolinas, 23 more homes were damaged. Although there was extensive property damage, no monetary value is available. Numerous calls were made to police in the United States Virgin Islands about downed power lines throughout the passage of the depression. High winds, gusting up to 40 mph (65 km/h) left roughly 500 people without telephone service on St. Croix. No major damage was reported on any of the affected islands in the wake of Christine. Residents in the drought- stricken regions of Florida were hoping for increased rainfall from the remnant wave of Christine; however, the system did not reach the United States before dissipating. The storm's remnants only produced squally weather in Florida on September 7 and 8.

Format The show was a half-hour program and is structured as a hybrid between a current affairs program and a satire/comedy show. The presenters were initially given a single editorial instruction: \\"Tell me something I don't know\\". Rather than conforming to a strict format, the final shape evolved alongside the presentation team that had been assembled. As a result, prior to the show's debut executive producer Andrew Denton described it as \\"unclassifiable\\" due to the chaotic nature of the work, likening the show's format to the Internet. Originally 19 presenters were used, but the second season saw the hosts pared down to just four, Kirsten Drysdale, Nicholas Hayden, Dan Ilic and Monique Schafter, although some of the other presenters continue to report onscreen. During the second season of Hungry Beast reporters Ali Russell and Kirk Docker were nominated for a Walkley Award for Coverage of Indigenous Affairs for their story on the \\"Gang of 49\\". Hungry Beast also was nominated for an ATOM Award in the Best Multimedia category, and an AFI Award for Best Light Entertainment. Pre-broadcast marketing Prior to the debut of the first series, Hungry Beast's pre-broadcast publicity incorporated perpetrating a hoax upon several Australian news agencies, in which they constructed a media release by the fictitious Levitt Institute. The release discussed a report called \\"Deception Detection Across Australian Populations\\", which looked at the comparative gullibility of people in different Australian states, and the release used a website and altered Wikipedia articles to provide support for the document. The hoax was successful, with a number of Australian media groups, including the AAP, running stories based on the material. When revealed, the hoax was criticised by the AAP who stated that they were \\"... disappointed that an individual, or organisation, would go to such lengths to take advantage of the Australian media and ultimately the Australian public.\\" History Hungry Beast was broadcast on Wednesday nights on ABC1 and repeated on Thursday night on ABC2. It was produced by Andrew Denton's production company, Zapruder's Other Films. Auditions were held in January 2009, with the presenting team announced that September. The third and final season of Hungry Beast began on ABC1 on Wednesday 23 March 2011 at 9:30pm with a smaller, more streamlined production team. The 12-week season has each episode themed around specific issues (e.g. Secrets, Waste, Captivity, Faking It, Download, Perfection and Wealth). Regular segments include Vox pops, \\"Follow The Money\\" and \\"The Beast File\\". On 29 November 2011, executive producer Andrew Denton confirmed that the show had been cancelled.

Santa Maria del Pi (, meaning \\"St. Mary of the Pine\\") is a 15th-century Gothic church in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It is situated on the Pla√ßa del Pi, in the Barri G√≤tic district of the city.  History  It is known that in 987 there existed a church outside the city walls and to the west of Barcelona. This was a small Romanesque church dedicated to the Blessed Lady of the Pine Tree (one of the titles of the Virgin Mary). The church was most built between 1319 and 1391. It opened on 17 June 1453. The style of the church was Catalan Gothic, with a single nave almost devoid of ornamentation. Peter the Ceremonious made donations at the year 1379 to begin to built the bell tower, which ended in the works directed by Bartomeu Mas, between 1460 until his death in 1497. The chapel de la Sang also was built by Bartomeu Mas in 1486. The earthquake in Catalonia in 1428 caused serious damage to the church, especially on the fa√ßade. It was affected by the bombings of 1714 during the war of the Spanish succession and by the explosion of a non-related ammunition dump causing the collapse of the presbistery and destroying the main altarpiece and all the ornaments that there were, although the Virgin and other images were saved. There was also damage to a side chapel as well as in the all of the nave's stained glass windows, which were broken during the siege. The church finds itself without the kidnapped bells and the ruined temple. Beginning in 1717, repairs began with the work of Joan Fiter, but a first restoration project was not carried out until 1863-1884 by Francisco de Paula del Villar y Lozano. The roofs of the chapels, the front and the rear facade were restored. The Baroque decoration of the temple was also eliminated. Towards 1915 it was restored again. In 1936 the church was gutted by a fire deliberately set by anarchists, who wanted to destroy the building. The church was restored following the end of the Civil War.  Facades  Tympanum The front fa√ßade has a large rose window, which is a faithful 1940 reproduction of the original window, which was destroyed in the fire of 1936. Below is the Gothic arch of the main entrance. The tympanum of the main entrance is divided by two small columns into three arched areas. In the central area is a statue of the Virgin and Child, and above this are placed the arms of the city and of the parish. The side fa√ßade has prominent buttresses that support the weight of the arches and vault of the nave. Between each pair of buttresses is a lancet window. In the centre of this fa√ßade is the Door of Avemaria. The rear fa√ßade also has buttresses and lancet windows that light the semi-circular apse. At the rear of the apse there is an ancient door from 1578 that previously gave access to the church via the rear fa√ßade. Over the years the construction of neighbouring buildings has obscured the ancient walls of the church.  Bell Tower  View of the church showing the octagonal bell tower. Interior of the church. The bell tower is octagonal in shape, rising to 54 metres. The walls at the base are 3.55 metres thick. It has a peal of six bells, of which the largest is \\"Ant√≤nia\\", which has a diameter of 1.4 metres and weighs 1,806 kilograms. Construction was started on the bell tower in 1460, under the instructions of the architect, Barthomeu Mas, and was completed in 1497.  Interior  The floor plan of the church comprises a single nave made up of seven rectangular sections, each covered with a vaulted ceiling and with side- chapels placed between the supporting pillars. The interior length of the nave is 54 metres, the width is 16.5 metres and the height is 12.2 metres. The fire of 1936 destroyed the high altar, the altarpiece, the statues, the choir stalls from 1868 and the organ created in 1808 by Johan de Kyburz. The high altar is made of alabaster and is the work of Joaquim de Ros i de Ramis. It was installed in 1967. In the presbytery is a statue of Santa Maria del Pi, 3.3 metres high, created in 1973 by sculptor Enric Monjo. The original Baroque choir stalls dated from 1771 and were designed by Josep Mas i Dordal. In 1868 these were replaced by neo-gothic stalls, which were destroyed in the fire of 1936. In 1986 the previous baroque stalls were re-instated. The original stained-glass windows have not survived. The oldest of those that exist now date from 1718. Of these, the window depicting the Adoration of the Magi (above the Door of Avemaria) is the work of Antoni Viladomat. Saint Joseph Oriol, canonized in 1909, who was priest in this parish between 1687 and 1702, is buried in this church in the Chapel of the Virgin Mary of Montserrat.

The program was created in 1998 as one of the early examples of the non-profit journalism movement, seeking to bridge the gap left by much of the mainstream media's reduction of international news. History of the Project The International Reporting Project (IRP) provides opportunities to journalists to go overseas to do international reporting on critical issues that are under covered in the U.S. news media. The program was created in 1998 by John Schidlovsky, a veteran journalist and former foreign correspondent for The Baltimore Sun in China and India. The program's early founding made it a pioneer in the ‚Äúnon-profit journalism‚Äù movement that seeks to fill the gap left by much of the mainstream media‚Äôs reduction of international news. The IRP has provided opportunities to more than 600 journalists to travel to more than 110 countries to produce prize-winning stories. The program is funded entirely by private, non-partisan foundations and individuals who believe in the importance of in-depth international coverage in the U.S. media. Since August 2016 the IRP has been based at New America, a nonpartisan research institution with offices in Washington, D.C., New York, and California. New America is committed to renewing American politics, prosperity, and purpose in the Digital Age. The organization's generate big ideas, bridge the gap between technology and policy, and curate broad public conversation. Due to our move our fellows have access to some of the world's leading specialists in international issues and a new platform for growing and expanding our mission. From its founding in 1998 through July 2016, the program was based at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) of The Johns Hopkins University. IRP Fellowships=Individual Projects The core program since 1998 has been the individual reporting grants, or fellowships, that IRP awards to professional journalists. In a highly competitive process, journalists submit project proposals to the IRP for grants that enable them to spend an average of five weeks overseas reporting on important international issues. These stories appear in leading media outlets around the world. IRP Fellows have also been awarded grants to cover major global conferences, such as the 2016 global summit on HIV/AIDS in Durban, South Africa and the 2016 climate change conference in Marrakech, Morocco. There have been 285 IRP Fellows in the program since 1998. These journalists have reported from more than 110 countries around the world. Among the journalists who have received IRP Fellowships are Steve Inskeep, co-host of NPR‚Äôs ‚ÄúMorning Edition‚Äù; Raney Aronson-Rath, executive producer at PBS Frontline; Joby Warrick, national security reporter at The Washington Post; Kathryn Schulz, staff writer for The New Yorker, Anne Barnard, Beirut bureau chief at The New York Times, and many others. Group Travel A second activity the IRP sponsors is the 12-day intensive reporting group trips for journalists. IRP has organized 28 reporting trips to 26 different countries. Participants on these trips have included senior producers, editors and reporters, as well as new media practitioners. Many of these trips have been thematic, focusing on topics such as health, environment, human rights or other issues. There have been 311 ‚ÄúIRP Trip Participants‚Äù in the program since 2000. The IRP has taken groups to Indonesia (twice), Brazil (twice), South Africa (twice), Lebanon/Syria, India (twice), Egypt, Nigeria, Korea (including the North), Uganda, Zambia, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Kenya (twice), Tanzania, Peru, China, Liberia, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Ecuador, Lesotho, Saudi Arabia, Mozambique and Nepal. Among those who have traveled on IRP trips are senior editors such as Jill Abramson, former executive editor at The New York Times; Davan Maharaj, executive editor at the Los Angeles Times; Douglas Jehl, foreign editor at The Washington Post and many others. Recent participants have included writer/reporters such as Irin Carmon, Zoe Fox, Sarika Bansal, Tom Murphy, Jill Filipovic, Azmat Khan, Lauren Bohn, Azad Essa and many others. Journalist-in-Residence Occasionally, the IRP also offers the \\"Journalist-in-Residence\\" fellowship, enabling senior journalists, in many cases, veteran foreign correspondents, to spend anywhere from one to eight months in Washington, D.C. to work on a book or other project about international affairs. Along with this program, occasional conferences, panel discussions and public events on international news coverage are present.

The area was visited frequently from the middle of the 17th century to the middle of the 18th century by privateers and buccaneers marauding Spanish colonial towns and the ships carrying gold to Europe. However little is known of the inhabitants of the region before the time of European contact. Archaeological research conducted since the middle of the 20th century has begun to illuminate the cultural history as well as development of societies in the region prior to Columbus arriving. Geographic Setting Bocas del Toro Archipelago Bocas del Toro is one of ten provinces in the Republic of Panama, and is located in the western part of the country. It is bounded by the province of Chiriqu√≠ in the south, the province of Veraguas (including the Ng√∂be-Bugl√© Comarca Comarca ind√≠gena) in the east, to the north is the Caribbean Sea and to the west is the Republic of Costa Rica. Bocas del Toro also refers to the archipelago which runs roughly northwest to southeast along the coast of the isthmus from the Seropta Peninsula to the Laguna de Chiriqu√≠ and includes the islands of Isla Col√≥n, Isla Solarte, Isla Bastimentos, Isla San Crist√≥bal, Isla Popa, and Cayo Agua. The province is further divided into three districts: Chiriqu√≠ Grande, Changuinola, and Bocas del Toro. Major cities include Changuinola, Almirante, and Bocas del Toro or (Bocas Town) which is also the provincial capital and is located on Isla Colon. The nine provinces and three provincial-level comarcas of Panama Early Research The earliest archaeological research in the region was conducted by Mathew Stirling in 1953 and revealed the existence of shell middens along the coastal plain Stirling and Stirling 1964 although very little was published about these. The geographer B.L. Gordon provided a more discerning interpretation of these middens Gordon 1962 and ‚Äúbegan to develop a bio-cultural profile of the area‚Äù.Seifert 2007 Gordon‚Äôs excavations yielded mostly mollusk remains, although he described an unknown number of metates and a low density of both ceramic sherds and stone tools in the form of triangular celts. From 1971 through 1972 Olga Linares conducted test excavations Linares 1977 at the Cerro Brujo shell midden site on the Aguacate Peninsula. This site is located on top of a ridgeline that divides Bah√≠a Almirante from Laguna de Chiriqu√≠, and is 3 km from the shoreline at approximately 140 m above sea level. She describes the site as a hamlet in which cultural material recovered from ‚Äútwo main midden clusters‚Äù Linares 1976 show an occupation period of 20‚Äì30 years from five radiocarbon dates ranging from AD 960 to AD 985. A complete survey of the Aguacate Peninsula was conducted by Linares in 1973 and in addition to Cerro Brujo three similar shell midden sites were located.Linares 1977 Recent Research The most recent site to be discovered and studied in the province is Sitio Drago on the northwest shore of Isla Colon, and has been investigated by Thomas A. Wake of the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology at UCLA from 2002 to the present. This site is located on a ‚Äústabilized beach ridge‚Äù Wake, et al. 2004: 1 between the tropical forest of the interior of the island and the coral reef immediately offshore. The site is identified by approximately 15 low mounds of stratified midden over 17 hectares. Test excavations have produced ‚Äúprestige goods, as well as a wider variety of general artefact types, and a greater diversity of ceramics than seen at Cerro Brujo‚Äù.Wake, et al. 2004: 2 Cultural material recovered include a wide variety of ceramic sherds and appliqu√© figurines which indicate interaction with the Pacific Chiriqu√≠ region, various stone tools (celts, blades), and a diverse collection of faunal remains (bone and mollusk). Radiocarbon dates from carbonized wood and Raphia nuts provide a timeframe of AD 900 to AD 1150 for the occupation period of the site. The diversity and density of the ceramics and other goods recovered from Sitio Drago have led Wake to surmise that ‚ÄúSitio Drago is much larger and appears more internally complex than the loosely organized farming hamlets such as Cerro Brujo,‚Äù.Wake, et al. 2004: 2 Interpretations Following Gordon, Linares surmised that the Bocas del Toro region was a marginal area to the supposedly larger and more complex culture area of Chiriqu√≠ on the Pacific coast of the isthmus of Panama.Gordon 1962Linares 1977 The paucity of sites, which appeared solely to be small hamlets identified by shell middens with a low density of stone artifacts, seemed to indicate a very low population spread out over a large area. The Bocas del Toro archipelago of islands was dismissed as having no significant importance, particularly because of Gordon‚Äôs assumption that the only sites off the mainland were similar small hamlets with shell middens, as reported to him (it is not mentioned who provided this information) on Isla Popa and Isla Crist√≥bal.Gordon 1962 Since the discovery and excavations at Sitio Drago, the Bocas del Toro region has been cast in a new light archaeologically. Wake argues that the assumptions made by Linares are empirically weak Wake, et al. 2004: 1 as they are based on a single excavated site and nominal investigation of the surrounding region. Diagnostic ceramics from Sitio Drago identified as Linarte Zoned Red Line ware and others ‚Äúsupport the idea of trans-isthmian connections‚Äù.Wake, et al. 2004: 3 Additionally, the greater diversity and density of stone tools, faunal remains, and prestige items at a site contemporaneous with Cerro Brujo lend to the hypothesis that the region was more complex socio-politically than previously assumed and that it was an integral part of the ‚ÄúGreater Chiriqu√≠ interaction sphere‚Äù.Wake, et al. 2004: 2 Current Investigations At this time Sitio Drago is still being investigated by Wake with colleagues Tomas Mendizabal and Alexis Mojica as the Proyecto Arqueol√≥gico Sitio Drago (PASD). In addition to publications forthcoming from Wake, Mendizabal, and Mojica, several new investigations are being conducted by students in coordination with PASD both at the site and in other parts of Isla Col√≥n.

Despite its success, the League suffered from two major weaknesses: lack of a well-defined social and economic programme, and lack of a strong party organisation.  Schisms in the Muslim League  Pakistan has an unstable party system and there is a tendency among political parties to divide into factions. Because in a multi-ethnic state like Pakistan political parties are the ultimate expression of democracy, internal rifts in them have largely contributed to political instability in the country. The first faction was created when Awami Muslim League was founded in Dhaka, the erstwhile capital of the Pakistani province of East Pakistan, in 1949 by Bengali nationalists Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani and Shamsul Huq. The Awami Muslim League was established as the Bengali alternative to the domination of the Muslim League in Pakistan. The party quickly gained massive popular support in East Pakistan, and eventually led the forces of Bengali nationalism in the struggle against West Pakistan's military and political establishment. Of all political parties in Pakistan, the Pakistan Muslim League has been most susceptible to fragmentation. It is a party whose fate has largely been controlled by outside forces rather than the party leadership or the people. In fact making and breaking of the League has been an important part of the establishment‚Äôs power strategy. Hence, not surprisingly, the League or a faction thereof remains united only when it is in power and lately the PPP-P under Zardari has become similar in many respects to the old Convention ML.

Dyke made his debut for Wales on 1 December 1906 versus South Africa and was selected for the 1908 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia. He played club rugby for Penarth and London Welsh. Rugby career Dyke was educated at Christ College, Brecon, which already had a history of producing notable international rugby players. He played for the College team, and on completing his education began playing for Penarth. At the start of the 1905/06 season Dyke was given the captaincy of the Penarth senior team, and held it for two seasons. It was while with Penarth that Dyke played his most notable games, and his first experience of international rugby came in 1905, when he was selected to play for Glamorgan against the Original All Blacks. The Glamorgan match was played just five days after New Zealand's historic clash with Wales, and the majority of the Welsh team were expected to turn out for the Glamorgan game. With the match approaching the majority of the team dropped out, including Wales fullback Bert Winfield.Billot (1972), pg 34. Dyke was called up as Winfield's replacement and turned out against New Zealand at St Helen's in Swansea on 21 December. Glamorgan lost by three tries to nil. A year later Dyke was involved in a turn around of events when chosen to win his first full international cap against the 1906 touring South Africans. The Welsh leg of the South African tour began with wins over Newport and Glamorgan, and the full back position in the Glamorgan game was given to Winfield.Billot (1974), pg 34. A month later, when the Welsh team was named, Dyke was given the fullback position. Dyke was one of three new caps against the Springboks, but critics felt that in their club games running up to the international encounter none of the players reached their full potential, but were better than any of their rivals.Billot (1974), pg 37. Dyke was chosen over Winfield as the South Africans had an impressive rushing tactic and Winfield's defence was not as strong as Dyke's. On the other hand, Winfield had an exceptional spiral punt, which was not matched in Wales until Vivian Jenkins in the 1930s, and Dyke's kicking was considered as far inferior. The Welsh team were beaten heavily, but if it hadn't been for Dyke the scoreline may well have been much worse,Billot (1974), pg 42. as his heavy tackling as the last defence prevented further runaway scoring. Dyke is also recorded as the only Wales player to increase his reputation during the game, but despite this he never represented Wales again. Dyke played several games in England and represented London Welsh, Coventry and played 2 games for Leicester on their north-east tour in 1908, but always retained his loyalty to Penarth. In 1908 Dyke was one of three Penarth players to be selected to join the Anglo-Welsh team on their tour of Australia and New Zealand. Dyke and fellow Penarth player Len Thomas made the trip, but Thomas' brother Ralph, was injured before the tour embarked for Australia and dropped out.History of Penarth RFC penarthrfc.co.uk Dyke played in thirteen games of the tour, but was not selected for any of the test games.John Dyke Lions profile lionsrugby.com During his return to Britain he rejoined Penarth, and in the 1908/09 season was invited to join invitational touring team, the Barbarians.

The experiment was approved in February 2007. Data taking began in 2015, and the experiment is expected to become the first in the world to probe the decays of the charged kaon with probabilities down to 10‚àí12. The experiment's spokesperson is Cristina Lazzeroni (since January 2019). The collaboration involves 333 individuals from 30 institutions and 13 countries around the world. Goals The experiment is designed to conduct precision tests of the Standard Model by studying rare decays of charged kaons. The principal goal, for which the design has been optimized, is the measurement of the rate of the ultra-rare decay with a precision of 10%, by detecting about 100 decay candidates with a low background. This will lead to the determination of the CKM matrix element Vtd with a precision better than 10%. This element relates very accurately the likelihood that top quarks decay to down quarks. The Particle Data Group's 2008 Review of Particle Physics lists Vtd = . A broad program of studies of kaon physics is run in parallel including studies of other rare decays, searches for forbidden decays and for new exotic particles not predicted by the standard model (for example Dark Photons).  Experimental Apparatus  In order to achieve the desired precision, the NA62 experiment requires a certain level of background rejection with respect to signal strength. Namely, high-resolution timing (to support a high-rate environment), kinematic rejection (involving the cutting on the square of the missing mass of the observed particles in the decay with respect to the incident kaon vector), particle identification, hermetic vetoing of photons out to large angles and of muons within the acceptance, and redundancy of information. Due to these necessities, the NA62 experiment has constructed a detector which is approximately 270 m in length. The components of the experiment are explained briefly below, for full details see .  Beam Line  The foundation of the NA62 experiment is observing the decays of kaons. In order to do this, the experiment receives two beams from the SPS, The Primary Beam, called P42, is used for the production of the K+ beam. The 400 GeV/c proton beam is split into three branches and strikes three targets (T2, T4, and T6). This produces beams of secondary particles which are directed through the underground target tunnel (TCC2). At the exit of T4, the beam of transmitted protons passes through apertures in two vertically-motorized beam- dump/collimator modules, TAX 1 and TAX 2 for P42, in which holes of different apertures define the angular acceptance of the beam and hence allow the flux of protons to be selected over a wide range. In order to protect the components of the apparatus, a computer surveillance program allows the currents in the principle magnets along the P42 beam line to be monitored and to close Tax 2 in case of error. A secondary beam line, K12HIKA+, is kaon beam line. This beam is designed to come from a high flux of 400GeV/c protons in the North Area High Intensity Facility. The target/beam tunnel, TCC8, and the cavern, ECN3, where the detectors of experiment NA48 have been installed, have a combined length of 270m. It is planned to reuse the existing target station, T10, (located 15m from the beginning of TCC8), and to install the secondary beam along the existing (straight) K12 beam line, of length 102m to the exit of the final collimator, which marks the beginning of the decay fiducial region and points to the NA48 detectors (notably the liquid krypton electro- magnetic calorimeter, LKR). These beams lead to 4.5 MHz of kaon decays in the fiducial region with a ration of ~6% for K+ decays per Hadron Flux.  Cedar/KTAG  The KTAG is the 'kaon tagger', designed to identify K^{+} particles within the unseparated hadron beam. This detector is a differential Cherenkov counter (CERN west-area Cedar), instrumented with a bespoke detector consisting of 8 arrays of photodetectors (KTAG) .  GigaTracker (GTK)  Placed immediately before the decay region of the kaons, the GTK is designed to measure the time, direction, and momentum of all the beam tracks. The GTK is a spectrometer and can provide the measurement from the incoming 75 GeV/c kaon beam. The measurements of the GTK are used for decay selections and for background reduction. The GTK is composed of three different stations labeled GTK1, GTK2, and GTK3 based on the order in which they are found relative to the beam path. They are mounted around four achromat magnets (which are used to deflect the beam). The entire system is placed along the beam line and is inside the vacuum tank.\\"Gigatracker (GTK)\\". CERN  CHANTI  This charged anti-counter detector (CHANTI) is primarily designed to veto events with inelastic interactions between beam particles and the GTK3. The detector is constructed from six planes of scintillator detectors surrounding the beam.  Straw Tracker  The kaon beam passes through the upstream region and into the decay region, a roughly 60 m long region inside a large vacuum vessel, after which the decay products are detected in the straw tracker stations. The system measures the direction and the momentum of secondary charged particles which come from the decay region. This spectrometer is made with four chambers intersected with a high aperture dipole magnet. Each of the chambers consists of multiple straw tubes positioned to offer four views to give four coordinates. Out of 7168 straws in the whole system, only one was flawed. The leaking straw was sealed and the detector operated normally during the 2015 run.\\"2015 NA62 Status Report to the CERN SPSC\\". CERN  Photon Veto Systems  The experiment has a photon veto system that provides hermetic coverage between 0 and 50 milliradians. This system is made up of several subsystems covering different angular ranges; the Large Angle Vetos (LAVs) cover 8.5 -- 50 mrad, the Liquid Krypton Calorimeter (LKr) covering 1-8.5 mrad and the Small Angle Vetos (SAV) covering 0-1 mrad. = Large Angle Vetos (LAV) = The 12 LAV stations are constructed from four or five annular rings of lead glass scintillator detectors surrounding the decay volume. The first 11 stations are operated in the same vacuum tank as the decay volume and STRAW while the final chamber (LAV12) is positioned after the RICH and operated in air. = Small Angle Vetos (SAV) , Intermediate Ring Calorimeter (IRC) and Small Angle Calorimeter (SAC) = The IRC and SAC are electromagnetic sampling calorimeters constructed from alternating layers of lead and plastic scintillators. The SAC is positioned at the very end of the experimental apparatus in line with the beam path but after the charged particles are bent away and sent into the beam dump. This means any photons traveling along the beam direction down to 0 angle can be detected.  Liquid Krypton Calorimeter (LKr)  The LKr detector is re-used from NA48 with upgraded readout systems. The active material of the calorimeter is liquid krypton. Electromagnetic showers, initiated by charged particles or photons, are detected via ionisation electrons which drift to anodes positioned inside the liquid krypton. The signals are amplified and distributed to the readout systems.  Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detector (RICH)  The RICH is designed to distinguish between pions and muons for particles of momentum between 15 and 35 GeV/c. It is constructed from a 17.5 m long vessel with diameter up to 4.2 m and filled with nitrogen gas (at about 990 mbar). As charged particles pass through the gas Cherenkov photons are emitted at a fixed angle determined by the momentum and mass of the particle and the pressure of the nitrogen gas. Photons are reflected from an array of mirrors at the downstream end of the RICH and detected in two arrays of photomultiplier tube detectors at the upstream end of the vessel.  Charged Hodoscopes (NA48-CHOD & CHOD)  The CHOD detectors are scintillator detectors which provide input to the trigger system detecting charged particles. The system is formed from the NA48-CHOD detector, re-used from the NA48 experiment and formed from 2 planes of scintillating bars arranged vertically and horizontally, and the newly constructed CHOD constructed from an array of scintillator tiles read out by Silicon photomultipliers.  Hadronic Calorimeters (MUV1 & MUV2)  The MUV1 and MUV2 are sampling hadronic calorimeters formed from alternating layers of iron and scintillators. The newly constructed MUV1 has fine transverse segmentation to separate electromagnetic and hadronic components of showers and the MUV2 is re-used from NA48.  Muon Veto Detector (MUV3)  The MUV3 is constructed from a plane of scintillator tiles, reach read out by a pair of photomultipliers, and positioned behind an 80 cm iron wall which blocks particles leaving only muons to be detected. This detector provides a fast muon veto at trigger level and is used to identify muons at analysis level.  Data  The experiment has run multiple tests to ensure that the new detector components were working properly. The first physics run with a nearly complete detector took place in 2015. NA62 collected data in 2016, 2017 and 2018 before the CERN Long Shut Down 2. Data analysis is ongoing and several results are in preparation.

Disc five features a previously unreleased live recording from Carnegie Hall. The boxset was reissued by EMI in 2010 in a standard jewel case set. All tracks appear here in stereo, the original singles released between 1959 and 1969 were released in mono. Later re-issues on compilations were stereo versions of the mono singles, these are the versions featured here. Original mono single recordings made for EMI Columbia were re-issued in 2006 on the 2-CD set The Complete EMI/Columbia Singles Collection. It was not unusual in this era to make a recording twice, as recording methods for mono and stereo were very different. This created two recordings of the same song, with differing vocals and instrumentation. Both versions were released on separate albums, making two versions of an album available. Mono albums were less expensive and it took a few years before stereo became the dominant market. Later all recordings were made in stereo but were mixed to mono for single releases. Several previously unreleased tracks were discovered in the EMI vaults and made available here for the first time. This box covers extensively Shirley Bassey's career from the late 1950s through to the late 1970s, from traditional pop to disco. All three of her world-famous James Bond themes are represented here, as are many rare single and EP only releases. Many of the tracks here had not been available in any form since the original release on vinyl. None of Bassey's live albums recorded in this period are represented on this release. Two B-sides were omitted: The 1976 B-side of \\"Natalie\\", a track titled \\"Runaway\\" (Shapiro, Lovecchio) (an Italian original), and the other was a 1979 cover of Barry Manilow's \\"Copacabana (At The Copa)\\" (Manilow, Sussman, Feldman) which only appeared on the 1979 single \\"This Is my Life\\". These two tracks are the only ones, originally released in the UK during the EMI/UA Years, not to have had a digital re-issue, as of October 2009. A fifth disc features a previously unreleased live recording made on 15 February 1964 at Carnegie Hall, New York. Planned for an album release, this performance was recorded live on a three track tape and was originally mixed for Mono. Due to limitations of the period the results were found unsatisfactory. In 1994 while this boxset was being planned the tapes were discovered and mixed for Stereo at Abbey Road, London. The recording represents well the experience of an early Shirley Bassey concert, highlighting some of her earliest recordings at her previous label (Philips) and showcasing a selection of her newest recordings taken from her first three albums at EMI/Columbia. Some of the performances found here are the only live recordings of several Bassey tracks. Her concert performances changed a great deal in the next few years. By the time she finally released Shirley Bassey at the Pigalle in 1965 her early recordings were no longer part of the set list. The song \\"Typically English\\" was never recorded in a studio version. Musical Direction on the original live recording was by Tony Osborne, and remixed for EMI by Tristam Penna and Ashley Alexander in September 1994. Track listing=CD One.

History  The church was probably built sometime in the 8th century, as it is first attested in the chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor for 769: it was there that the future emperor Leo IV (r. 775‚Äì780) married Irene of Athens.Maguire (2004), p. 55 The church was located close to the ceremonial heart of the palace, the throne room of the Chrysotriklinos and the adjoining imperial apartments.Klein (2006), p. 80 Following the end of iconoclasm, it was extensively rebuilt and redecorated by Emperor Michael III (r. 842‚Äì867). As restored, it was a relatively small building with a ribbed dome, three apses, a narthex and a \\"splendidly fashioned\\" atrium.Maguire (2004), p. 56 On the occasion of its rededication, probably in 864, the Patriarch Photios held one of his most famous homilies lauding the church's spectacular decoration.Mango (1986), pp. 185‚Äì186 Indeed, Photios takes the unusual step of criticizing the church, albeit subtly, for being too sumptuous, especially given its small size.Necipoƒülu (2001), pp. 171‚Äì712 Together with the churches of St Stephen in the Daphne Palace and the Nea Ekklesia, the Virgin of the Pharos came to hold one of the major collections of Christian holy relics. Consequently, and because of its proximity to the imperial quarters, it became one of the major ceremonial locations of the imperial palace,Klein (2006), p. 93 eventually rising to be, in the words of Cyril Mango, the \\"palatine chapel par excellence\\".Mango (1986), p. 185 Already by 940, its collection of relics included the Holy Lance and a part of the True Cross, and during the next two centuries, successive emperors added more relics: the Holy Mandylion in 944, the right arm of St John the Baptist in 945, the sandals of Christ and the Holy Tile (keramion) in the 960s, the letter of Christ to King Abgar V of Edessa in 1032. By the end of the 12th century, according to accounts by Nicholas Mesarites, the church's skeuophylax, and travellers such as Anthony of Novgorod, the collection had grown to include even more relics, particularly of the Passion: the Crown of Thorns, a Holy Nail, Christ's clothes, purple mantle and reed cane, and even a piece from his tombstone.Klein (2006), pp. 91‚Äì92Maguire (2004), pp. 56, 67‚Äì68 As a result, the church was hailed by the Byzantines as \\"another Sinai, a Bethlehem, a Jordan, a Jerusalem, a Nazareth, a Bethany, a Galilee, a Tiberias.\\" The French Crusader Robert of Clari, in his narrative on the sack of the city by the Crusaders in 1204, calls the church la Sainte Chapelle (\\"the Holy Chapel\\"). The chapel itself avoided plunder during the sack: Boniface of Montferrat moved swiftly to occupy the area of the Boukoleon Palace, and the relics passed safely on to the new Latin Emperor, Baldwin I (r. 1204‚Äì1205).Angold (2003), pp. 235‚Äì236 Over the next decades however, most of these were dispersed throughout Western Europe, given as gifts to powerful and influential rulers or sold off to procure money and supplies for the embattled and chronically cash-strapped Latin Empire.Angold (2003), pp. 236‚Äì239 Many of them, especially those pertaining to the Passion, were acquired by King Louis IX of France (r. 1226‚Äì1270). In order to house these relics, he built a dedicated palace church, characteristically named Sainte-Chapelle in direct imitation of the Virgin of the Pharos.Maguire (2004), pp. 56‚Äì57Angold (2003), p. 239 The concept was again imitated in the relic chapel of Karlstejn Castle, built by Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV (r. 1346‚Äì1378) and tied to his pretensions of being a \\"new Constantine\\".

Panoramic view from the tower of Worcester Cathedral. View from the River Severn with Worcester Road Bridge in the foreground. The Glover's Needle (or St Andrews Spire) is a spire-carrying tower in the city of Worcester, England.SO8454: Glover's Needle, Deansway, Worcester, Geograph, UK.  Location  The tower is a prominent landmark of the city, from road, rail, or the River Severn, and can be seen for miles around. It is located in St Andrews Gardens close to Worcester College of Technology.Glover's Needle , Worcester Water Walkabout , UK. The spire used to crown the church of St Andrew but this was demolished in the late 1940s. The Glover's Needle is seated on Deansway Road, Worcester Cathedral being very close to the south and All Saints Church to the north. On the western side of the spire the pedestrian can descend into gardens that lead onto the River Severn. Across the road from the Glover's Needle is a \\"House of Fraser\\" shop which stands on the site of the old graveyard of St Andrews. At night the spire is illuminated (but not the tower below) and a blue glow is projected from inside one of the windows. The blue represents St Andrew, the colour of the Scottish flag. The blue glow and night lighting were paid for by the Rotary Club of Worcester Severn, to commemorate the millennium in 2000.  History  St. Andrews, a church with a tall spire, was built in the 15th century, but this was destroyed in a great storm of 1733. Shortly after this disaster, the spire was rebuilt. It was constructed by using the ingenious method of kite flying to carry up the stones. Worcester people took the new masterpiece to their hearts and named it the 'Glover's Needle'. This name came from the industrial glove making that was executed in Worcester. The entire structure measures approximately 245 feet. It is the tallest spire in the country to have such a narrow angle of taper. In the 1920s the slum housing which crowded round the church was demolished. The congregation of the church was thus reduced by a large degree. The church fell into decay, had an overgrown churchyard, few parishioners and a tiny parish of five acres. In the 1940s, the council accepted the Bishop of Worcester's offer of the church. They decided to demolish the church and create a garden of remembrance to replace it, but decided to leave the tower and spire, freestanding. The rest of St Andrew's church was demolished in 1949.  Developments near the millennium  As a millennium project, a clock was installed in the tower and now the hours are struck on the council bell. A recently reinstated custom is to have the council bell strike from 18:45 to 18:50 before a full meeting of the council. In the early 2000s a fence was put around the base of the spire. A few years ago, the RSPB has taken the Glover's Needle into their own hands and the actual spire is now used for special birds of prey for roosting. Live web cams have been installed in the tower.  Bells  The Glover's Needle formerly housed a set of five bells. These were hung full circle for proper English style change ringing. In 1870, four of the bells were sold but the tenor (heaviest bell) was retained in the old bell frame. This bell weighs 20 CWT ‚Äî 1 ton. This is the so-called council bell mentioned above. It is unlikely that the Glover's Needle could sustain a ring of bells today as there is no church to buttress the swaying tower.

The band played its first show in Stockholm in July 1990 at Frietzfronten in St. Eriksgatan 89, an underground bar owned by a Swedish political party. In the same year they appeared on ZTV (Swedish Music TV Channel) playing live from Stockholm Water Festival. They played their first large headline show at the WGT in 1995. Then known as Fat Bob & The Cureheads. The Cureheads name is taken from the Irish slang term for anyone with that \\"1980's mop haired 'Gothic' look\\". They were originally known as \\"Fat Bob & The Cureheads\\" until 2000.l When Ita Martin of Fiction Records suggested they should change the name as not to offend The Cure Since 1990, The Cureheads has played venues including The Vic Theater in Chicago, Camden Palace in London, The Temple Bar Music Centre in Dublin, CBGB in New York, and Razzmatazz in Barcelona. In 2010 The Cureheads played to 10,000 people ƒ±n Chile at the Teatro Caupolic√°n in Santiago (the old national basketball stadium of Chile). The show was recorded for national television and covered by national TV news, as The Cure had never played in Chile up until after that point despite having a huge fanbase there. The band has toured in the UK, the US, continental Europe, and South America, playing festivals, including opening for Echo and The Bunnymen and The Pretenders at Guilfest, BKK Live in Bilbao (opening for Depeche Mode), The Isle of Wight Festival (2016 & 2017) and Roskilde Festival in Denmark, The band state that they strive to re-create the experience of seeing a mid to late 1980s concert by The Cure, capturing not only the sound, but also the wardrobe, attitude and staging using lighting and various background video and computer images. In 2007, The Cureheads were given as a wedding gift by Charlie Simpson of Busted to the bass player of his new band Fightstar. The band played a 1-hour set and were joined onstage by Charlie Simpson for a performance of The Cure‚Äôs \\"Inbetween Days\\". The band claim that Charlie fell off the stage and passed out during the last verse. In 2012, The Cureheads played in Paraguay and Argentina ahead of The Cure playing there in 2013.

In particular, the AFC test is used to determine whether non-literal elements of a computer program have been copied by comparing the protectable elements of two programs. The AFC test was developed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1992 in its opinion for Computer Associates Int. Inc. v. Altai Inc.Bruce Abramson, Promoting Innovation In The Software Industry: A First Principles Approach To Intellectual Property Reform, 8 B.U. J. Sci. & Tech. L. 75, 123 (2002) (\\"Various courts have proposed elegant tests for determining when a second program is \\"close enough\\" to an earlier copyright-protected competitor to constitute infringement. Perhaps the most influential of these tests is the abstraction-filtration-comparison test, first introduced by the Second Circuit in Computer Assoc. Int'l v. Altai and subsequently adopted by several other circuits.\\"). It has been widely adopted by United States courts and recognized by courts outside the United States as well. Background The Second Circuit Court of Appeals developed the AFC test for use in Computer Associates Int'l, Inc. v. Altai Inc. In that case, Computer Associates sued Altai for copyright infringement of a computer job scheduler program that was designed to be easily ported between operating systems. Proving copyright infringement requires proving both ownership of the copyright and that copying took place. This second requirement can be met either by direct proof, or as is more usually done, by demonstrating the following: 1) the defendant had access to the copyright material and 2) there is substantial similarity between the copyrighted work and the defendant's work.Altai, para. 39. Demonstrating substantial similarity can be difficult when the two works are not exact replicas, either in full or in part. The Second Circuit court had found there was little previous guidance on how best to do this. One notable previous treatment of substantial similarity of the structure, sequence and organization (SSO) of software was adopted by the Third Circuit in Whelan v. Jaslow.Whelan Associates Inc. v. Jaslow Dental Laboratory, Inc. , 797 F.2d 1222 (3d Cir. 1986). The court there suggested identifying the main function of a program as the idea and everything that is not strictly necessary for the purposes of the idea can be considered expression. The Altai court declined to follow this method, noting that the Whelan method \\"did not place enough emphasis on practical considerations\\".Altai, para. 72. The AFC test was devised to handle that issue; it is a method for determining whether substantial similarity exists between two computer programs, especially in non-literal elements of the program. Abstraction-Filtration-Comparison The AFC test is a three-step process for determining substantial similarity of the non-literal elements of a computer program. The process requires the court to first identify the increasing levels of abstraction of the program. Then, at each level of abstraction, material that is not protectable by copyright is identified and filtered out from further examination. The final step is to compare the defendant's program to the plaintiff's, looking only at the copyright- protected material as identified in the previous two steps, and determine whether the plaintiff's work was copied. In addition, the court will assess the relative significance of any copied material with respect to the entire program.Jon O. Newman, New Lyrics For An Old Melody: The Idea/expression Dichotomy In The Computer Age , 17 Cardozo Arts & Ent. L.J. 691, 695-696 (1999) (\\"Altai then advised courts to \\"dissect the allegedly copied program's structure and isolate each level of abstraction contained within it.\\" This is to be done, we are told, by charting the program into a hierarchy of modules, each identified, apparently, by the function it performs. Having stratified the program into these levels of abstraction or modules, we are then to move on to what Nimmer calls, and Altai embraces, a \\"'successive filtering method' for separating protectable expression from non-protectable material.\\" We are to make the separation by determining whether what the opinion calls \\"the structural components at each level of abstraction\\" is an idea, which would be unprotectable, or is covered by any of three other inquiries, which if satisfied, would also render the component unprotectable. The first is whether the component was \\"dictated by considerations of efficiency, so as to be necessarily incidental to that idea.\\" The second is whether the component was \\"required by factors external to the program itself.\\" The third is whether the component was \\"taken from the public domain.\\" Once this \\"filtration\\" has occurred, the allegedly infringing program is compared to the protectable elements that have survived filtration to determine whether protectable elements have been copied and to assess the relative importance of the copied elements to the plaintiff's overall program.)\\" Abstraction The purpose of the abstraction step is to identify which aspects of the program constitute its expression and which are the ideas. By what is commonly referred to as the idea/expression dichotomy, copyright law protects an author's expression, but not the idea behind that expression.Altai, para. 76. In a computer program, the lowest level of abstraction, the concrete code of the program, is clearly expression, while the highest level of abstraction, the general function of the program, might be better classified as the idea behind the program. The abstractions test was first developed by the Second Circuit for use in literary works,Altai, para. 75-78. but in the AFC test, they outline how it might be applied to computer programs. The court identifies possible levels of abstraction that can be defined. In increasing order of abstraction; these are: individual instructions, groups of instructions organized into a \\"hierarchy of modules\\", the functions of the lowest-level modules, the functions of the higher-level modules, the \\"ultimate function\\" of the code.Altai para. 81. Filtration The second step is to remove from consideration aspects of the program which are not legally protectable by copyright. The analysis is done at each level of abstraction identified in the previous step. The court identifies three factors to consider during this step: elements dictated by efficiency, elements dictated by external factors, and elements taken from the public domain.Altai, para. 83. The court explains that elements dictated by efficiency are removed from consideration based on the merger doctrine which states that a form of expression that is incidental to the idea cannot be protected by copyright. In computer programs, concerns for efficiency may limit the possible ways to achieve a particular function, making a particular expression necessary to achieving the idea. In this case, the expression is not protected by copyright.Altai, para. 85-98. Eliminating elements dictated by external factors is an application of the sc√®nes √† faire doctrine to computer programs. The doctrine holds that elements necessary for, or standard to, expression in some particular theme cannot be protected by copyright.Altai, para. 100-101. Elements dictated by external factors may include hardware specifications, interoperability and compatibility requirements, design standards, demands of the market being served, and standard programming techniques.Altai, para. 101-104. Finally, material that exists in the public domain can not be copyrighted and is also removed from the analysis. Comparison The final step of the AFC test is to consider the elements of the program identified in the first step and remaining after the second step, and for each of these compare the defendant's work with the plaintiff's to determine if the one is a copy of the other. In addition, the court will look at the importance of the copied portion with respect to the entire program.Altai, para. 108. Acceptance and Use of AFC Following the Altai case, the AFC method has been widely adopted. Since 1992, every court to deal with the issue of determining substantial similarity in the non-literal aspects of computer programs has chosen the AFC method over the Whelan method.Lemley 2006, p. 54. The analysis of the filtration step has been endorsed by courts in Canada and France.Lemley 2006, p. 55. In the UK, the AFC test has the dubious honor of being endorsed and disapproved in successive cases. Current English law does not follow the AFC test laid out in Altai.

The NDIC complements the regulatory and supervisory role of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), although it reports to the Federal Ministry of Finance. The NDIC advises the CBN in the liquidation of distressed banks and manages distressed banks' assets until they are fully liquidated. The NDIC has a supervisory role over insured banks. In April 1996, the Chief Executive of NDIC said that the corporation had 514 case files of insider abuse and corruption for the police to prosecute. In December 2007, the NDIC announced that as of January 1, 2008 it would start providing deposit insurance services to microfinance institutions in Nigeria. Activity In February 2002, the governor of the Central Bank, Joseph Oladele Sanusi, issued a notice revoking the license of Savannah Bank, saying the bank did not have enough assets to meet liabilities and did not comply with CBN obligations, and that the regulators had to prevent further deterioration. The NDIC took over as liquidator, sealing the bank's offices. The matter dragged through the courts, with the bank's owners eventually being awarded damages of N100 million in February 2009. Under a Purchase & Assumption arrangement, the NDIC may arrange for the assets and liabilities of a failed bank to be taken over by another bank. For example, in October 2007 the United Bank for Africa assumed the fixed assets and private sector deposit liabilities of African Express Bank under direction of the CBN and the NDIC. At times, the NDIC has been caught up in controversy over legal actions against managers and others who have caused insured banks to fail. Shortly before his retirement in July 2009, the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation accused the Inspector General of Police Mike Okiro of failing to repay a N166 million loan he obtained between 2000 and 2001 from the Lead Bank, since liquidated.

Rugby career John played rugby from a young age and represented his local grammar school as a youth. His first club was Crynant, but by the time he gained his first cap in 1950 he had switched to first-class side Neath. His international debut came on 21 January against England as part of the 1950 Five Nations Championship. John gained his place as his club partner, Rees Stephens had been forced to withdraw from the team.Smith (1980) p. 320 John was one of five new caps entering a team that had finished bottom of the table in the year's previous tournament.

During the 1950‚Äì51 season John was given the captaincy of the Neath team. John was back in the Wales squad for the 1951 Five Nations Championship playing in all four matches. Despite a resounding win over England in the opening match, Wales ended the competition on third after draw with Ireland and loses to France and Ireland. The same year John faced the 1951 touring South Africa team. First at club level when a joint Aberavon and Neath team on 17 November, and then a country level with Wales, twice ending on the losing side. Despite losing to the South Africans with Wales, John so dominated the line-out that the Springboks' coach, Danie Craven, ordered his team not to contest them.Smith (1980), p. 344 John continued his unbroken run of Wales appearances with another four games in the 1952 Five Nations Championship. The pivotal game of the tournament turned out to be the team's first match away to England. England led the encounter in the first half with England scoring two tries when key Welsh player Lewis Jones was off the pitch for treatment. Wales responded strongly in the second half led by their pack with John dominating the line-out. Wales went on to win all three remaining games giving John his second Grand Slam title. 1952 also saw Neath tour Ireland, which John joined despite being on honeymoon there.An Irish Honeymoon . neathrugby.co.uk 1953 saw John complete his fourth full Championship, in which Wales came second, losing just one game to eventual winners England. John's penultimate international came in December 1953, when he was chosen to face the touring New Zealand team. Although John no longer possessed his old agility, a storming response from the forwards saw Wales snatch their last win over the All Blacks that century. John faced the same New Zealand team in late January 1954, when another joint Aberavon/Neath team lost 11‚Äì5 to the tourists. John's final international, his nineteenth consecutive game for Wales, was an away match to England, which Wales lost through a last minute try from England's Chris Winn. Playing style While a youth at Neath Grammar School, John had played on the wing, at centre and at fly-half before moving into the back row. Despite his height, at 6 ft 3ins, John possessed a swerve and dummy more worthy of a half-back. He was used as a number 8 during the Lions tour, and once as a Wales international played as flanker. Of all his rugby abilities, John is best remembered for his strength in the line-out.

Oselvar on Os Kommune coat of arms Oselvar with sail The Oselvar or Oselver is a small wooden rowing boat traditionally built and used along the west coast of Norway. The Oselvar is a clinker built boat with thin, very wide planks. Almost all parts of an Oselvar are made of pine, with only the keel of oak. Oselver (Store norske leksikon) Tradisjon i tre (Os kommune) History This type of boat has been very common in the outer regions of Hordaland for hundreds of years. It was named after the major important building site for this type of boat during the 18th century, at the mouth of the Oselva River in Os in Hordaland county. In the early 1800s, boat building was an important industry in Os and the neighboring village of Tysnes, on the other side of the fjord. The stylized figure of an Oselvar appears on the coat of arms of the municipality of Os. Oselvaren - om b√•ten og b√•tbyggjartradisjonen (Os Kommune) Dating from at least the 1500s and continuing until 1860, these boats were exported in kit form principally to the Shetland and Orkney islands. During the North Sea crossing, the wooden boats were taken apart and then 'flat packed' for shipping. Instead of sending complicated assembly instructions, they sent Norwegian boatbuilders to re- build them. Strileb√•ten (Oselvarverkstaden) Although initially a working row or sail boat, the Oselvar also has a long tradition as a leisure craft. A boat which could achieve both grace and speed was perfect for sailing and rowing competitions. The first regatta was arranged by the Bergen Sailing Association on Midsummer‚Äôs Day in 1871. Today several clubs and sailing associations are engaged in promoting the traditions of the Oselvar, both as a sports and leisure boat. In 2009, the boat was voted Norwegian national boat in a poll held by the Norwegian Society for Sea Rescue.

In 1981 he developed the concept of interactive broadband local loop cable TV for mass market consumer telecommunications. Aldrich had a 38-year career in the IT industry, 20 years of which were spent as CEO of an international computer company, Redifon/Rediffusion/ROCC Computers. He retired as CEO in 2000 and became non- executive Chairman (2000-2014). He also worked for Honeywell (now Groupe Bull) and Burroughs Corporation (now Unisys). Aside from his inventions and innovations, he is known for his pro bono public service. He was an IT adviser to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 1981-86, IT adviser to the Confederation of British Industry January 1982-December 1983, President of the Institute of Information Scientists 1984-85, and Chairman of the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations 1989-99. He has had a long, formal association with the University of Brighton in various capacities since 1982. Personal life Michael Aldrich was born on 22 August 1941 in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, England. He went to school at Clapham College in London and, in 1959, he won a scholarship to the University of Hull to study History. He became engaged to Sandy Kay Hutchings, a student at Hull Art College, originally named Hull School of Art, in 1960, and they married in 1962, just prior to his graduation. They had four children and were grandparents to eight grandchildren. Biography, Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton Career Aldrich spent 15 years with Honeywell and Burroughs in the UK in various sales and marketing roles, where he became known as an innovator, before joining the Board of Redifon in 1977. In 1979, Aldrich invented online shopping by connecting a modified domestic TV to a real-time transaction processing computer via a domestic telephone line. The intellectual basis for his system was his view that videotex, the modified domestic TV technology with a very simple menu-driven human‚Äìcomputer interface, was a 'new, universally applicable, participative communication medium-the first since the invention of the telephone.' This enabled 'closed' corporate information systems to be opened to 'outside' correspondents not just for transaction processing but also for messaging (e-mail) and information retrieval and dissemination (later known as e-business.)1982 Videotex Communications, Collected Papers Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton December 1982 His language of 'impacts competitive trading position', 'using IT for competitive advantage', 'externalises labour costs', etc. became commonplace in the management consultancy industry later in the 1980s.1982 Management Guide to IT,Collected Papers Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton January 1982 These ideas fed into the Business Process Reengineering strategies of the 1990s. His concept of information technology as a mass communications medium is a driver for the contemporary IT industry. His definition of the new mass communications medium as 'participative' (interactive, many-to-many) was fundamentally different to the traditional definitions of mass communication and mass media and a precursor to the social networking on the Internet 25 years later. In March 1980 he launched Redifon's Office Revolution. The Revolution was that corporate computer information systems had hitherto been in-house. From hereon consumers, customers, agents, distributors, suppliers and service companies would be connected on-line to the corporate systems and business would be transacted electronically in real-time.1980 TV paves the way for Information Brokerage, Minicomputer News p. 12 London May 1980, the most comprehensive report of the March 1980 Press Conference launching the Redifon R 1800/50 computer system.

In 1980 he invented a system he called the 'Teleputer' by connecting a modified 14-inch colour television to a plinth containing a Zilog Z80 microprocessor running a modified version of the CP/M operating system and a chip set containing a modem, character generator and auto-dialler. The Teleputer of 1980's operate as a stand-alone colour PC (at a time when computer screens were mainly mono-chromatic), with a full complement of application software and network with other computers via dial-up or leased lines.1981 Large.PThe Thing has arrived, and guess what- it's British teleputer, The Guardian London 30 September 1981 The system included two 360 KB floppy disks (later a 20 MB Hard disk), a keyboard and a printer. The name 'Teleputer' later became synonymous with the fusion of computers, telecommunications and television in a single device. There were plans to add video-disks which at the time, in prototype form, were 12 inches. In many ways the Teleputer was the first home media centre concept.1981 Price.P Living by Numbers, The Sunday Times Colour Supplement, London 27 September 1981 Although the Teleputer had been conceived for mass market home use, it was put into production for business use with the TV tuner removed. There was no consumer electronics market for it (at the time the consumer electronics market was just waking up to the VCR) but it was relatively easy to cost- justify the Teleputer for business networking.1981 Charlish.G Enter the Teleputer, all purpose information tool, Financial Times London 2 October 1981 It was widely used in the UK and, because a Cyrillic version was made, in the then USSR.

Peugeot-Talbot (1981), then trading as Talbot Motors, installed a system for dealers to locate and adopt both a new car from the manufacturer or a used car from other dealers. Ford (1982) installed systems with ISPs in Brentwood England and Valencia Spain that permitted dealers in many European countries to buy new cars from Ford or transfer existing new cars from other dealers' lots. General Motors[1985] used systems for selling truck spares. The Nissan[1984] systems were truly revolutionary. They combined car purchase by the dealer from the manufacturer (known in the industry as 'adoption') with car sale and financing to the consumer.1988 Behind the driving wheel at NISSAN, Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton, The Nissan systems networked credit ratings from outside agencies (mainly UAPT Infolink 1985)1985 Uapt/Infolink, Innovative Information Systems Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton Summer 1985 and finance provision from either Nissan or other suppliers in real-time as part of the complete consumer purchasing transaction. This is the world's first recorded B2C online shopping for high value consumer durables and a model for the complex internet-based online shopping transactions for consumer durables that followed 20 years later. The Nissan system was copied by other credit rating and finance companies at the time but these systems appear to have been supplied by Aldrich's company under confidentiality agreements and no record is extant.Introduction,Innovative Information Systems,Aldrich Archive Para 9,University of Brighton Aldrich's systems directly changed the holiday, retail, auto, finance and credit ratings industries. Online shopping was an important development for electronic commerce. E-commerce changed the way the world does business. Both of his B2C systems in Gateshead and Bradford were shopping and information services. Bradford Centrepoint [1987] even ran a news service at one point. These systems were pioneering pre-internet systems.1993 Cahill.M Computer Technology and Human Services in the 1990s: Advancing Theory and Practice: Teleshopping and Social Services in the UK, 'Computers in Human Services' Vol. 9 [3/4] London 1993 Aldrich's original intention had been to develop a consumer electronics market for IT systems linked to a concept for broadband interactive information processing and cable TV distribution. He had a particular schema for a wired community.1982 Aldrich.M 'Videotex Key to the Wired City' Quiller Press London He campaigned successfully to change the law in the UK to permit new cable TV technology.1982 Aldrich.M co-author'Cable Systems'HMSO London Aldrich articulated and broadcast the ubiquitous business and social potential of his mass communications medium concept of IT and created systems to realise that dream, sold and installed them, and created satisfied clients. Well known in the 1980s in the UK, he was all but forgotten 20 years later. His ideas were copied, plagiarised and patented in the 1990s without acknowledgement.Introduction to the Aldrich Archive, Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton 'None of the US Patents[ for online shopping and the online shopping trolley] mention Michael Aldrich, John Phelan or Redifon/Rediffusion/ROCC' Thomson Holidays reverse-engineered his system (the sincerest form of homage in the computer business)1989 Allan E. Altar 'The Great Chiefs of Europe-Colin Palmer' CIO Magazine, IDG UK February 1989 pp29-31 and in the peer-reviewed 1988 report used his language while virtually air-brushing his contribution. For online shopping he produced both the system and the business rationale for using it. The tie between his online shopping systems and the innovative information systems he created is the concept that videotex was a new, mass communications medium. That was the giant conceptual leap from the world of EDP to modern IT, emancipating computing from corporate information centres, and a precursor to the development of the Apple Mac and Microsoft Windows approaches to universal human/computer interface design for PCs and the Apple iPhone 3G. The three areas of his work in consumer electronics‚Äîonline shopping/Teleworking/Telebanking, Home Information Centres and broadband cable TV‚Äîand his book, papers and UK Government reports represent a significant contribution to the development of contemporary IT mass communications, consumer information and transaction systems, electronic commerce and e-business. Aldrich's ideas are the basis for Internet home shopping. In June 2011 an ICM Poll in the UK voted Aldrich's date of birth as the 7th most important date in the history of the internet. 2011 ICM Poll UK In April 2012 the UK Intellectual Property Office [formerly the UK Patents Office] nominated Aldrich for a public poll to identify the UK Visionary Innovator to celebrate World IP Day on 26 April. He came 4th in the Poll. He was also an innovator in other areas of computer and information technology including large-scale data capture, mixed media scanning, minicomputer networking, voice response and handprint processing. He patented the world's first static signature recognition system in 1984. He founded ROCC Computers in 1984 after a management buy-out of Rediffusion Computers. The company traded mainly in the UK and Eastern Europe. High-profile IT projects In the 20 years from 1978 to 1998, Michael Aldrich and his team undertook many high-profile projects which in many ways created the company's reputation. A number of case studies have survived. It was not unusual for the times that there were high-profile IT projects; what was unusual was that a small UK IT company of 500‚Äì700 people became involved in high profile, high value, high risk and technically difficult projects. What is even more unusual is that there is no evidence to suggest that the projects were anything but very successful. The first project for which evidence survives was to provide a system to automatically read handprinted timesheets for the nationalised railway, British Rail with over 100,000 employees, to complete the weekly payroll.[1978]. Regional centres were established throughout the UK. Scanners were used to read timesheets and for other applications. The systems were used for many years.1978 British Rail, Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton The largest project was the Siberian Gas Pipeline for Gazprom[1981-83] where 46 computer systems with 1200 terminals and 240 Teleputers were networked to provide logistics support for the operation of the pipeline. Every aspect of the project was fraught with difficulties, including political, technical, environmental, technical support, economic and resourcing problems. Some 1500 Russian hardware and software specialists were trained. The system was the most advanced IT system then installed in the USSR. It was used for many years.USSR, Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton The largest European project was the Ford Europe system [1981-83] for dealers to locate and adopt a car, an online shopping system for dealers in the UK and much of Europe networking to systems based in the UK and Valencia, Spain. The system was used for nearly two decades.1985 Ford, Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton The largest UK project, apart from the Inland Revenue [the UK IRS], was the pricing of over 334 million medical prescriptions per annum for the Prescription Pricing Authority[1981-83][now NHS Prescription Services], part of the UK's single provider health system.These systems were used throughout the UK for a decade or more. The most politically sensitive project was probably the cattle passport system for the British Cattle Movement Service to address the BSE[mad cow disease] crisis in 1998.1988 British Cattle Movement Service, Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton, There were hundreds of other projects. The legacy of these projects is somewhat perverse. Leading- edge technology was seen to work well and to be reasonably easy to implement. It may have encouraged others to take risks that were not always justifiable. The 1990s onwards in the UK saw a succession of big, failed IT projects. Profession Michael Aldrich became a Fellow of the British Computer Society in 1984 and he was made a Chartered Fellow in 2004. In 1986 he was invited to become a Companion of the Chartered Management Institute, the UK's elite management leadership organization. He is an Honorary Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals. In 2002 he was awarded an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Letters by the University of Brighton for services to Information Technology. Michael Aldrich was invited to address an invited audience including British Royalty on 23 March 1983 in Edinburgh, Scotland to mark the 25th Anniversary of the founding of the British Computer Society.1983 HRH Duke of Kent etc,'Computing', Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton 14 April 1983 The speech was titled 'Computers in the Community.'1983 Computers in the Community,Aldrich Archive,February 1983 University of Brighton, In 1987 Michael Aldrich was made a Freeman of the City of London,England. He became a Founder Member of the Company of Information Technologists which became a Chartered City Livery in 1992. The Company's membership consists of senior IT professionals. He is a Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Information Technologists.Biography, Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton Information Technology Advisory Panel 1981‚Äì86 In 1981, at the beginning of the IT age, the British Government assembled a team of six UK IT experts, on a pro bono basis, to provide high- level advice to the government. This team was known as the Information Technology Advisory Panel. It reported to Prime Minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher and was located in the Cabinet Office adjacent to 10 Downing Street in London, England. In its five-year existence it produced three reports for publication by the government. Little else is known about its activities. Michael Aldrich was a member of the team for the whole term of its existence. He wrote a seminal paper on re-cabling the UK with local loop broadband cable and paying for it without government subsidy by distributing cable television alongside data and telephone services.1981 Aldrich.M. The Original Discussion Paper, Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton The panel then wrote a report, published it and the government subsequently changed the law to legalise such systems.1982 Aldrich M.co-author Cable Systems,London- HMSO 1982 By 2007, 12 million UK homes were passed by these high-speed broadband links.2008 Aldrich M. Cable Story,Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton The second report concerned the emerging software and information business and, among other issues, identified the potential power of providers who might control both content and electronic delivery.1983 Aldrich M. co-author Making a Business of Information London- HMSO 1983ISBN 011 6308249 The third report was a long- range forecast of the potential effects of IT on schools and teaching and it predicted powerful PCs on school desks.1986 Aldrich M. co-author Learning to Live with IT, London- HMSO 1986 The Panel was disbanded in 1986. Tavistock Institute of Human Relations 1989-99 Michael Aldrich became a member of the Council of the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations[TIHR] in 1988 and was elected Chairman in 1989, a post he held for a decade. TIHR was then located at the Tavistock Clinic hospital in Hampstead, London, England. The TIHR was spun out of the Tavistock Clinic as a charity in 1947. The Tavistock Clinic is a centre of excellence for studying and addressing the clinical behaviour of individuals. The TIHR is focussed on group behaviour. In 1988 the TIHR had an illustrious history at the forefront of the social and psychological sciences but was somewhat in the shadows of the world-famous founding fathers who had once worked there or indeed were still working there. These people were approaching retirement and the TIHR needed to renew itself. The transition of the TIHR was to take nearly two decades. The 1989-99 period was characterised by the physical relocation of the TIHR from the Tavistock Clinic in Hampstead to its own building in London's City financial district; the stabilisation of the Institute's finances;the 50th Anniversary[1997] celebration that saluted the past achievements while embracing future challenges; the publication of the Tavistock Anthology'The Social Engagement of Social Sciences, A Tavistock Anthology' Vols 1-3 Trist.E, Emery.F and Murray.H, University of Pennsylvania Press 1990-97 which served to draw an elegant line under the TIHR's previous achievements; and the development of new lines of research by a talented younger team. Michael Aldrich left the Council in 1999. He remains a member of the Tavistock Association. University of Brighton Michael Aldrich first became involved with the then Brighton Polytechnic in 1977 when he was sponsoring student employees for degrees in electronic engineering and computer science. Under the sponsorship, employees were paid to attend college full-time for degrees. In 1982 he joined the governing body of the college, became Chairman and then Founding Chairman of the University of Brighton. In all he served 17 years on the governing body of the institution, 11 years as Chairman[1987-1998]. He retired from the Board of Governors in 1999. In 1990 he was responsible for appointing Professor [later Sir] David Watson as the first Vice-Chancellor[1990-2005]. A particularly talented leadership team developed the new university and for 1999 the University was declared 'University of the Year' by the London 'Sunday Times' newspaper. In 1992, Aldrich became Founding Chairman of the University's Foundation a fundraising body. The Aldrich family has been a longtime benefactor of the University. In 1995 Michael and wife Sandy began the Aldrich Collection of Contemporary Art which, by 2009, had grown to more than 300 works dating back over 100 years.Selected Works:The Aldrich Collection at the University of Brighton, ed Miles.B,2000. The works have been created mainly by former students and artist professors at the University's highly rated Faculty of Art.'The Aldrich Collection' Jonathan M Woodham, Art and Design in Brighton 1859-2009, the University of Brighton Centre for Research and Development 2009, pp 387-393 The works are also held in web-accessible digitised form to provide a permanent virtual gallery. Aldrich Collection Faculty of Art University of Brighton In 1996 the University named its new business, bio-sciences, engineering and technology library the 'Aldrich Library.' In 2002 Aldrich relinquished the chairmanship of the Foundation and remained a Trustee. In 2008, Michael Aldrich agreed to donate his IT papers for the period 1977-2000, the Aldrich Archive, to the University for teaching, learning, scholarship and research. Much of the first part of the archive which relates to technology and events has been digitised and is web-accessible.Michael Aldrich Archive,University of Brighton The second phase of the archive project was launched in 2010. It will gather and digitise material relating to the people who built and used the systems. In November 2010 the University of Brighton Business School announced that it would be using the Aldrich Archive for teaching and research.A Michael Aldrich Prize would be awarded to the outstanding e-commerce student on merit each year.2010 'Getting down to Business with the help of the Aldrich Archive' University of Brighton The first awards were made in the Summer of 2011.

The album was originally planned to be released in 1975 and McCartney revisited the project several times over the years until it was abandoned permanently in the late 1980s. The songs on the album were recorded during his solo career and with Wings in the 1970s and 1980s. History The album was originally conceived as a budget release in 1974, composed of non-album singles and previously unreleased tracks.\\"Random Notes\\" Rolling Stone 21 November 1974: 26 McCartney began work on the album during Wings' recording sessions in Nashville, Tennessee in July 1974, recording several new songs and overdubbing some previously unused tracks. The album, variously referred to as Cold Cuts or Hot Hitz and Kold Kutz, was slated for release in March 1975 but never materialized.Bailey, Jerry \\"Paul & Linda Try the Gentle Life\\" The Tennessean July 18, 1974: 67 In January 1981, McCartney and Wings recorded additional overdubs for the unreleased tracks with the album slated for release in early 1981. However, Columbia Records was not interested in releasing an album of outtakes and the album was shelved.Sounes, Howard. Fab: An Intimate Life of Paul McCartney (2010): 365 It was also believed that its release soon after the death of John Lennon would seem inappropriate. Producer/arranger Richard Niles did further work on the tracks in 1986. In August 1987, McCartney mixed and edited another version of the album with producer Chris Thomas and engineer Bill Price.Weiner, Allen.

Autodesk, Inc. was a case in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington regarding the applicability of the first- sale doctrine to software sold under the terms of so-called \\"shrinkwrap licensing.\\" The court held that when the transfer of software to the purchaser materially resembled a sale (non-recurring price, right to perpetual possession of copy) it was, in fact, a \\"sale with restrictions on use\\"United States v. Wise, 550 F.2d 1180 (9th Cir. 1977). giving rise to a right to resell the copy under the first-sale doctrine. As such, Autodesk could not pursue an action for copyright infringement against Vernor, who sought to resell used versions of its software on eBay. The decision was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which issued a decision on September 10, 2010, reversing the first-sale doctrine ruling and remanding for further proceedings on the misuse of copyright claim. The Ninth Circuit's decision asserted that its ruling was compelled by Ninth Circuit precedent, but observed that the policy considerations involved in the case might affect motion pictures and libraries as well as sales of used software. The net effect of the Ninth Circuit's ruling is to limit the \\"You bought it, you own it\\" principle asserted by such organizations as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (or EFF). Claims Under the first-sale doctrine, copyright holders give up the right to control the distribution of copies of their works after an initial first sale to the original purchaser. Informally, owners of copies of copyrighted works (books, music, etc.) have the right to sell or dispose of their copies of the work without restriction and without the need to seek permission from the copyright holder. Vernor claimed that he purchased \\"authentic, used copies\\" of Autodesk software, and that he never opened, installed, or agreed to the included license terms, and was within his rights to resell those copies of the software without interference by Autodesk. He further claimed that Autodesk's use of the DMCA to inhibit these sales constituted an unlawful restraint of trade. Autodesk counter claimed that copies of its software were licensed, not sold to the original parties. Thus, in Autodesk's view, the first-sale doctrine did not apply - the original parties were never owners of their copies and so had no authority to resell the software to Vernor. Thus Vernor was infringing Autodesk's copyright and Autodesk was within their rights to block such sales. Autodesk also contended that, as the CD was a mechanism for making a copy of the software, Vernor enabled his clients to make unlicensed copies of Autodesk software and Vernor was liable for contributory copyright infringement. Finally, Autodesk claimed that in purchasing the software from a licensee, Vernor was bound by the terms of that license - despite never having agreed to it. This last claim was dismissed by the court. An important aspect of this case is that CTA, who originally bought the software, had purchased an upgrade to it and then sold the older versions. This potentially raises a different specific issue about the legality of re-selling upgraded software versus just selling used software. Conflicting precedent? As the district court analyzed the case, the crucial issue was whether the transfer of the copy of the software from Autodesk was a sale or a license. If sales, then Vernor would prevail, but if licenses, Autodesk would prevail. In trying to determine the controlling precedent, the district court focused on four cases from the Ninth Circuit. The oldest case addressed the classification of sales and transactions for the purposes of first sale doctrine explicitly in the context of the transfer of motion picture film prints. The last three, to the extent they focused on the issue of classifying the nature of software transactions at all, did so in the context of section 117 of the U.S. Copyright Act: > Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106,. it is not an infringement > for the owner of a copy of a computer program to make or authorize the > making of another copy or adaptation of that computer program provided [that > the owner meets two conditions.] The findings of these cases were as follows: * United States v. Wise (9th Cir. 1977). :In United States v. Wise, which directly addressed the classification of sales and licenses for the purposes of first sale with respect to film prints, the court found that the crucial factor was whether the transaction gave rise to a right of perpetual possession in the transferee. If the transferee was entitled to keep the copy acquired from the copyright holder, it was a sale. If the transferee was required to return the copy, it was not a sale. * MAI Sys. Corp. v. Peak Computer (9th Cir. 1993). :In MAI Sys. Corp. v. Peak Computer, the court considered the claim that loading a program into RAM constituted making a copy for the purposes of copyright infringement. The court found that it did and further stated in a footnote (without explanation and without citing to any supporting precedent) that \\"since MAI licensed its software, [its] customers do not qualify as 'owners' of the software and are not eligible for protection under 117.\\"MAI Sys. Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc., 991 F.2d 511 (9th Cir. 1993). The MAI decision has been extensively criticized, a fact recognized by the Ninth Circuit itself in Wall DataWall Data v. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Dept., 447 F.3d 769 (9th Cir. 2006) (\\"We recognize that our decision in MAI has been criticized. See Nimmer on Copyright ¬ß 8.08[B][1][c], at 8-136; see also DSC Commc'ns Corp. v. Pulse Commc'ns, Inc., 170 F.3d 1354, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 1999).\\"). and the primary holding of MAI was overruled by a statutory change to made by Congress as a rider to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, but only for purposes of \\"machine maintenance or repair.\\" * Triad Sys. Corp. v. Southeastern Express Co. (9th Cir. 1995). :In Triad Sys. Corp. v. Southeastern Express Co., the court implicitly distinguished between owners of copies of software and non- owners by contrasting those that purchased \\"the software outright\\",Triad Sys. Corp. v. Southeastern Express Co., 64 F.3d 1330 (9th Cir. 1994). who were presumed to have section 117 rights, with those who did not. The court cited MAI, but not earlier precedent. * Wall Data v. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Dept. (9th Cir. 2006). :In Wall Data v. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Dept, the court determined that the presence of a license with restrictions was \\"sufficient to classify the transaction as a grant of license to Wall Data's software, and not a sale of Wall Data's software.\\"Wall Data, Inc., v. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Dept., 447 F.3d 769 (9th Cir. 2006). Again, the court cited MAI, but not earlier precedent. District court's analysis The district court found the precedents cited above to be in direct, irreconcilable conflict. Under the MAI, Triad, and Wall Data cases, the transfer of software from Autodesk accompanied by a restrictive license, would not be a sale and the first-sale doctrine would not apply, and thus Vernor would not be permitted to redistribute the software. However, under United States v. Wise, the transfer of copies of Autodesk's software would be considered sales, because the realities of the transfers imply a right of perpetual possession of the copy, and so Vernor would be protected under the first-sale doctrine. Given the conflicting precedents, the court felt compelled to rely on the earliest precedent, Wise, and thus found in Vernor's favor. The earliest precedent is followed because a panel of Circuit judges are bound by stare decisis to follow their court's prior panel decisions and only depart from them if there has been intervening Supreme Court precedent on point or an en banc decision of the Circuit holding otherwise.United States v. Rodriguez-Lara, 421 F.3d 932 (9th Cir. 2005). The district court also rejected Autodesk's assertion that Vernor was bound by license terms of software he did not install or agree to. The court cited both \\"thorny issues\\" of implicit consent and the absurdity of asserting the transferability of a license that, by the definition of its terms, was nontransferable.Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc., 555 F.Supp. 2d 1164 (W.D. Wash. 2008); see also Order on summary judgment, Sep. 30, 2009. Ninth Circuit's Analysis Judge Consuelo Callahan, writing for the Ninth Circuit, agreed with the district court that the crucial issue was whether the arrangement was a sale or a license. Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc., No. 09-35969, slip op. at 13871-72. The Ninth Circuit's holding is that the transaction is a license. Its analysis covers the same four cases analyzed by the district court, but derives different principles from them: > We read Wise and the MAI trio to prescribe three considerations that we may > use to determine whether a software user is a licensee, rather than an owner > of a copy. First, we consider whether the copyright owner specifies that a > user is granted a license. Second, we consider whether the copyright owner > significantly restricts the user‚Äôs ability to transfer the software. > Finally, we consider whether the copyright owner imposes notable use > restrictions. [Footnote omitted.] Our holding reconciles the MAI trio and > Wise, even though the MAI trio did not cite Wise. See Cisneros-Perez v. > Gonzales, 451 F.3d 1053, 1058 (9th Cir. 2006) ('[W]e are required to > reconcile prior precedents if we can do so.') Slip op. at 13878. Those principles favor Autodesk: > Autodesk retained title to the software and imposed significant transfer > restrictions: it stated that the license is nontransferable, the software > could not be transferred or leased without Autodesk‚Äôs written consent, and > the software could not be transferred outside the Western Hemisphere. The > SLA also imposed use restrictions against the use of the software outside > the Western Hemisphere and against modifying, translating, or reverse- > engineering the software, removing any proprietary marks from the software > or documentation, or defeating any copy protection device. Furthermore, the > SLA provided for termination of the license upon the licensee‚Äôs unauthorized > copying or failure to comply with other license restrictions. Thus, because > Autodesk reserved title to Release 14 copies and imposed significant > transfer and use restrictions, we conclude that its customers are licensees > of their copies of Release 14 rather than owners. > CTA was a licensee rather than an 'owner of a particular copy' of Release > 14, and it was not entitled to resell its Release 14 copies to Vernor under > the first sale doctrine. 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 109(a). Therefore, Vernor did not > receive title to the copies from CTA and accordingly could not pass > ownership on to others. Both CTA‚Äôs and Vernor‚Äôs sales infringed Autodesk‚Äôs > exclusive right to distribute copies of its work. Id. ¬ß 106(3). Slip op. at 13880. The Ninth Circuit observed that because the district court had relied on the \\"first sale\\" doctrine, it had not reached Vernor's claim that Autodesk had misused its copyright, and the Ninth Circuit therefore remanded that second claim for further proceedings. Slip op. at 13887. Implications=The ruling The district court's ruling tried to harmonize used-software sales with the first-sale doctrine consumers are familiar with in the context of used books, music CDs, and movie DVDs by treating used copies of software similarly. Shrinkwrap licensing is widely used in an attempt to enforce restrictions that would otherwise be considered fair use under copyright laws. Common terms imposed by these licenses include the prohibition of resale, modification, and/or reverse engineering. Under the district court's Vernor v. Autodesk ruling, the enforceability of these terms would have had to be weighed against the countervailing policies implicit in the Copyright Act. The Ninth Circuit's decision sets out a summary of the policy questions involved and suggests that Congress could amend the statute if it wanted a different result. Here's the analysis: > Although our holding today is controlled by our precedent, we recognize the > significant policy considerations raised by the parties and amici on both > sides of this appeal.\\" Autodesk, the Software & Information Industry > Association ('SIIA'), and the Motion Picture Association of America ('MPAA') > have presented policy arguments that favor our result. For instance, > Autodesk argues in favor of judicial enforcement of software license > agreements that restrict transfers of copies of the work. Autodesk contends > that this (1) allows for tiered pricing for different software markets, such > as reduced pricing for students or educational institutions; (2) increases > software companies‚Äô sales; (3) lowers prices for all consumers by spreading > costs among a large number of purchasers; and (4) reduces the incidence of > piracy by allowing copyright owners to bring infringement actions against > unauthorized resellers. SIIA argues that a license can exist even where a > customer (1) receives his copy of the work after making a single payment and > (2) can indefinitely possess a software copy, because it is the software > code and associated rights that are valuable rather than the inexpensive > discs on which the code may be stored. Also, the MPAA argues that a > customer‚Äôs ability to possess a copyrighted work indefinitely should not > compel a finding of a first sale, because there is often no practically > feasible way for a consumer to return a copy to the copyright owner. Vernor, > eBay, and the American Library Association ('ALA') have presented policy > arguments against our decision. Vernor contends that our decision (1) does > not vindicate the law‚Äôs aversion to restraints on alienation of personal > property; (2) may force everyone purchasing copyrighted property to trace > the chain of title to ensure that a first sale occurred; and (3) ignores the > economic realities of the relevant transactions, in which the copyright > owner permanently released software copies into the stream of commerce > without expectation of return in exchange for upfront payment of the full > software price. eBay contends that a broad view of the first sale doctrine > is necessary to facilitate the creation of secondary markets for copyrighted > works, which contributes to the public good by (1) giving consumers > additional opportunities to purchase and sell copyrighted works, often at > below-retail prices; (2) allowing consumers to obtain copies of works after > a copyright owner has ceased distribution; and (3) allowing the > proliferation of businesses. The ALA contends that the first sale doctrine > facilitates the availability of copyrighted works after their commercial > lifespan, by inter alia enabling the existence of libraries, used > bookstores, and hand-to-hand exchanges of copyrighted materials. The ALA > further contends that judicial enforcement of software license agreements, > which are often contracts of adhesion, could eliminate the software resale > market, require used computer sellers to delete legitimate software prior to > sale, and increase prices for consumers by reducing price competition for > software vendors. It contends that Autodesk‚Äôs position (1) undermines 17 > U.S.C. ¬ß 109(b)(2), which permits non-profit libraries to lend software for > non-commercial purposes, and (2) would hamper efforts by non-profits to > collect and preserve out-of-print software. The ALA fears that the software > industry‚Äôs licensing practices could be adopted by other copyright owners, > including book publishers, record labels, and movie studios. These are > serious contentions on both sides, but they do not alter our conclusion that > our precedent from Wise through the MAI trio requires the result we reach. > Congress is free, of course, to modify the first sale doctrine and the > essential step defense if it deems these or other policy considerations to > require a different approach. Slip op. at 13885-86. Reaction to the ruling The EFF believes that this will lead to more litigation as other software vendors try to find ways to restrict sales of second-hand software, as well as other owners of intellectual property. Some retailers are worried that the ruling could affect selling used video games as well. Gregory Beck from Public Citizen who is Vernor's attorney says that the ruling will have a chilling effect on the used software market. On October 1, 2010, Vernor filed a petition for the case to be reheard en banc. Autodesk filed its reply on November 10, 2010.

Theme Glenarvon corrupts the innocent young bride Calantha (Caroline herself) leading to their mutual ruin and death. The picture of her husband, William Lamb (the 2nd Viscount Melbourne from 1828), called Lord Avondale in the book, is more favourable, although he too is held to be partly responsible for Calantha's misfortunes: his biographer remarks that the book's message is that Caroline's troubles are everybody else's fault.Lord David Cecil (1965). Melbourne. Pan Books Edition. p. 122. The book is full of wildly improbable melodramatic scenes: Calantha's infant brother, the heir to a duchy, is apparently murdered on the orders of their aunt Lady Margaret, to ensure that her son will inherit the estates; yet later we are told that the child is still alive. A second edition softened somewhat the book's sensationalism.Glenarvon Impact The book was an enormous success with the reading public but ruined Lamb's already questionable reputation. Society's leaders did not greatly mind reading about her love affairs, but they deeply resented the vicious and easily recognisable portraits of themselves in the book, which were its chief \\"selling point\\". One of those thus satirised, Lady Jersey, took her revenge by barring Lamb from Almack's, the centre of fashionable life, a sign that she was socially an outcast. A Melbourne biographer remarked that Lamb never found her way back into society again.

He was a judge on the Superior Court of Los Angeles County in California. Background The son of a New York City clothing manufacturer, he graduated at the age of 19 from the New York University School of Law, after having entered directly from high school. After graduating with his law degree from NYU, he found he was too young to take the bar exam. While waiting, he earned a degree from Harvard University, graduating summa cum laude. After passing the bar, he worked in the U.S. Attorney's office in New York and taught law at City College of New York. He also had a private law practice. He was wounded in North Africa during World War II. He was appointed to the Los Angeles Municipal Court in 1961 by then-Governor Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, Sr. He was appointed to the Superior Court the following year. Brown and Rittenband had different politics; Brown was a Democrat, and Rittenband was a Republican. Notable cases His legal career spanned 60 years, during which he presided over several much publicized cases, including Elvis Presley's divorce, Marlon Brando's child-custody battle, a paternity suit against Cary Grant, the Billionaire Boys Club murder trial of Joe Hunt, and the criminal proceedings against Roman Polanski. A Los Angeles Times story about Rittenband entitled \\"Laurence J. Rittenband, 81, Shows an Unorthodox Style: Crusty Judge Rules His Court With Iron Hand\\" described controversy around the judge's conduct during the Hunt case. The story said Hunt's defense team had a host of complaints against Rittenband, who put a gag order on one of Hunt's defense attorneys after they publicly criticized his actions. In response, lawyers Arthur Barens and Richard Chier moved for mistrial on the basis of judicial misconduct. Rittenband once vowed to remain on the bench until Polanski was behind bars, but retired in 1989, when he was 83 years old. Rittenband issued an arrest warrant for Polanski when he fled in 1978; Polanski was arrested in September 2009 in Switzerland, while traveling to a film festival there, but was later released and allowed to return to France. The 2008 documentary Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired attacks Judge Rittenband for both his private life and his handling of the Polanski case. He was removed from the case in February 1978 after a complaint filed by Polanski's attorney and supported by the prosecutor in the case, as attested by both in individual interviews in the documentary. Shortly after Polanski fled, Rittenband denied he ever did anything that the 2008 documentary would go on to allege, by issuing the following statement: > I then stated that an appropriate sentence would be for Mr. Polanski to > serve out the remainder of the 90-day period for which he had been sent to > Chino, provided Mr. Polanski were to be deported by the Immigration and > Naturalization Bureau, by stipulation or otherwise, at the end of the 90 > days. I expressly stated that I was aware that the court lacked authority to > order Mr. Polanski deported directly or as a condition of probation. > However, based on the facts before me, I believed that the safety and > welfare of the citizens of California required that Mr. Polanski be kept out > of circulation for more than 90 days. However, since Mr. Polanski is an > alien who had pleaded guilty to an act of moral turpitude, I believe that > the interests of the citizens of California could be adequately safeguarded > by a shorter jail term if Mr. Polanski would thereafter absent himself from > the country.

The company was founded in 2002 by Scott M. Smith, Ryan Smith, Jared Smith and Stuart Orgill. Qualtrics offers a subscription software platform. On November 11, 2018, it was announced that Qualtrics would be acquired by SAP for $8 billion. The acquisition was completed on January 23, 2019. On July 26, 2020, SAP announced its intent to take Qualtrics public. History=Funding and valuation In 2012, the company received a $70 million Series A investment from Sequoia Capital and Accel, generally considered two of the top venture capital firms in the country. It was the largest joint investment to date by these two firms. In September 2014, Sequoia Capital and Accel returned in Series B funding, led by Insight Partners worth $150 million, a record for a Utah-based company, and valuing the company $1 billion. In April 2017 Qualtrics received a Series C investment round of $180 million from returning investors Accel, Sequoia Capital, and Insight Venture Partners. The Series C was raised at a $2.5 billion pre-money valuation.  Filing for IPO  On October 19, 2018, Qualtrics filed their S-1 registration statement with the intention of raising gross proceeds of $200 million through an initial public offering (IPO) of its Class B shares. At the time, the company listed 9,000 global customers. The company was meant to be listed on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker \\"XM\\" in reference to their flagship experience management product, the Qualtrics XM Platform. Plans for the IPO were scrapped when it was announced in November 2018 that Qualtrics would be acquired by SAP (NYSE: SAP). Awards and ranking In 2016, Qualtrics was ranked #12 on the Forbes Cloud 100 list, moving to #6 in 2017. In March 2020, Qualtrics' CoreXM platform was named a 2020 gold winner by the Edison Awards in the Applied Technology category.  Revenue  Qualtrics reported revenue of $190.6 million in 2016 and $289.9 million in 2017 representing year over year growth of 52%. In 2016, Qualtrics reported an overall net loss of $12 million with free cash flow of $3.4 million. In 2017, Qualtrics reported a $2.6 million net profit with free cash flow of $21.3 million. Acquisitions In May 2016 Qualtrics acquired statistical analysis startup Statwing for an undisclosed sum. Statwing was a San Francisco-based company that created point-and-click software for advanced statistical analysis. In April 2018 Qualtrics acquired Delighted for an undisclosed sum.

SAP acquired all outstanding shares of Qualtrics for US$8 billion in an all cash deal. SAP secured ‚Ç¨7 billion in financing. At the time it was announced, the Qualtrics acquisition was SAP's second-biggest purchase ever behind the $8.3 billion acquisition of travel and expense management firm Concur in 2014. The acquisition was formally closed January 23, 2019.  Initial public offering (IPO)  On 26 July 2020, SAP announced its intents to take Qualtrics public through an IPO in the United States. The decision to go public was made due to Qualtrics' performance since the acquisition which outperformed SAP's expectations in excess of 40 percent.

Mario Braggiotti (November 29, 1905 ‚Äì May 18, 1996) was a United States pianist, composer and raconteur. His career was launched by George Gershwin, who became his friend and mentor. Early history Braggiotti was born in Florence, Italy; his father was an Italian tenor, Isidore Braggiotti, born in Smyrna, Turkey; his mother was an American mezzo-soprano from Boston. His musical abilities were evident early. As a child, nicknamed \\"Tunti,\\" he would return from attending an opera, sit at the piano, and recreate by ear the arias he had just heard performed. He was the fourth of eight children. One sister, Francesca, became the wife of Ambassador John Davis Lodge, another sister, Gloria, married artist Emlen Etting and was for decades a leading socialite in Philadelphia as well as a published author. (see Gloria Braggiotti Etting) After Mario's mother died in 1919, the Braggiotti family returned to Boston. Mario attended The New England Conservatory in Boston then at 17 entered the Paris Conservatoire and the summer Fontainebleau Music School outside Paris. He studied piano with Alfred Cortot and Isidor Philipp and composition with Nadia Boulanger. Friendship with George Gershwin While in Paris, Braggiotti teamed up with pianist Jacques Fray to become the duo piano team, Fray and Braggiotti. Mario arranged all the music for the fledgling duo to perform, and they began playing at the Left Bank club \\"Boeuf sur le Toit\\". When George Gershwin came to Paris to compose An American in Paris, the young men introduced themselves to their idol,Jablonski, Edward. Gershwin, a Biography. New York: Doubleday, 1987, pp. 158, 159. who immediately put them to work trying out the famous taxi horns he was writing into that composition. In 1928 Gershwin helped launch their careers by hiring them to play in his London production of Funny Face with Fred and Adele Astaire.Jablonski, p. 148. Mario became a good friend of Gershwin,Jablonski, pp. 159, 160. who once said, \\"Mario plays my music the way it should be played.\\"Quoted by John Davis Lodge, who recounted to Susan Braggiotti that Gershwin said it in Lodge's presence. Later Braggiotti introduced the Rhapsody in Blue, both with orchestra and in its solo version, in various parts of Europe. The Rhapsody became his signature piece in all his performances. Pre-war appearances In 1929 Fray and Braggiotti came to New York, touring and making guest appearances on radio. Braggiotti was the first to combine both classical and popular music on the same program.Kimball, Robert and Alfred Simon. The Gershwins. Atheneum, 1973, pp. 95‚Äì96. The team became hugely popular and was billed as \\"The First Team -- the Last Word.\\" They debuted at Carnegie Hall,Jablonski, p. 159. played in New York's Town Hall and subsequently were featured on a tour with Maurice Chevalier. In the 1930s the duo became a household name when hired by William Paley. Fray and Braggiotti performed three nights a week on CBS's nationally broadcast Kraft Music Hall, and Radio City Music Hall. The team toured extensively throughout the US in those years, appearing at the Hollywood Bowl and at the White House, among other notable venues. World War II service When World War II broke out, Braggiotti, an American citizen despite his Italian birth, enlisted in the US Army and was put in the Psychological Warfare Branch of the Office of War Information. As the Allies began their campaign in Casablanca and moved up through the Italian peninsula, Braggiotti took charge of the local and national radio stations and began broadcasting American music and information. Post-war career After the war, Braggiotti returned to the US and developed a one-man show that blended comedy and music. He wrote and performed his \\"Variations on the Theme 'Yankee Doodle'\\" in the styles of various classical composers, which were published by Schirmer in 1949. Continuing to include both classical and popular music on his programs, he intermingled the piano pieces with humorous anecdotes. He also worked his talent for improvisation into his program by taking three random notes from the audience and creating a composition around them. During this period, he toured throughout Western Europe and South America as well as the US. In the 1950s Braggiotti wrote his Gettysburg Cantata, based on Lincoln's speech and scored for baritone solo, chorus, and orchestra. It premiered at Carnegie Hall with Izler Solomon conducting and Lawrence Winters as soloist. During this period Braggiotti was chosen by philanthropist Frank Hale to compose a ballet, \\"The Princess,\\" which debuted in Palm Beach and opened subsequently in London.The ballet was later known as \\"The Kingdom of Gifts\\". In 1963 Braggiotti took over the radio program To France with Music (previously Listening with Jacques Fray) on New York's WQXR after the death of Mr. Fray, its original host.Sanger, Elliott M. Rebel in Radio, The Story of WQXR. Hastings House, 1973, p. 124. Later life and death Braggiotti continued to compose. His body of work over the subsequent years includes a children's musical, Lisa, with Joan Javits, and a musical comedy based on his sister Gloria Braggiotti Etting's family memoir, Born in a Crowd. In 1972 Braggiotti began collaborating with the pianist Susan Snodgrass Andis. Together they wrote the musical I Danced with a Tree and revised Born in a Crowd. Braggiotti and Andis married and formed a new duo- piano team. He wrote more of his caricatural \\"Variations on 'Yankee Doodle'\\", including two vocals for which Susan wrote the lyrics. He did an orchestral reduction of his Gettysburg Cantata using two pianos, percussion, and bass along with the soloist and chorus. With his wife, Braggiotti composed and arranged more music for duo-pianos, and the team performed his works internationally. Together they founded the Braggiotti Music School based in Tuscany. Their collaboration ended with his death on May 18, 1996. Honors and awards Among honors bestowed upon Braggiotti were a commendation from the City of Florence for his great Gershwin interpretations, honors from the Sons of Italy, and an induction into the Big Band Hall of Fame in 1995. He was a member of ASCAP. Personal life Braggiotti was linked romantically with socialites, actresses, and European noblewomen.Duke, Vernon. Passport to Paris. Boston: Little, Brown and Co., 1955, pp. 213-214. His wit, talent, and charm made him popular, and he kept up his friendships in all parts of the world with his voluminous letter-writing. He married three times, first in 1939 to Francise (Baby) Clow of Chicago,Duke, p. 302. then in 1952 to Edwina Feigenspan Osborne of New York. Both of those marriages ended in divorce. Susan Braggiotti continues her career as a pianist while overseeing their collection of musical scores. She arranged for Braggiotti's works to be housed in the International Piano Archives at the University of Maryland. Braggiotti was a gourmet cook, often preparing Tuscan specialties at lively dinner parties. He studied Buddhism, believed in reincarnation, and was health- conscious throughout his life. Many of his ideas were decades ahead of their time. His ashes are buried in Florence (Italy) at the Cimitero Evangelico agli Allori. ReferencesFurther reading *DeSantis, Florence Stevenson. Gershwin.

Its notoriety stems from its use in 1944, by the Nyilas government to incarcerate, torture, and execute its opponents. Famous prisoners, like General Vilmos Nagy of Nagybaczon, and Endre Bajcsy- Zsilinszky, were imprisoned here, with Bajcsy-Zsilinszky executed in late 1944. After World War II, the prison served as the holding facility for the Allied Military Tribunals until 1947, when it reverted again to serve as a prison until 1951. Prior to World War II, it served as a workhouse, and after 1951, the buildings were used for successive commercial enterprises. The Austrian border near the village was the site of the 1989 Pan-European Picnic breach by East Germans gathered to escape to Western Europe, and which precipitated the collapse of the Iron Curtain.Der Spiegel article References Category:Populated places in Gy≈ër-Moson-Sopron County Category:Prisons in Hungary ","title":"Sopronk≈ëhida"},{"id":"24503688","text":"The Ding Xian Experiment () during the Republican period of Chinese history was a project in Rural Reconstruction sponsored by James Yen's Mass Education Movement (MEM) ‰∏≠ÂçéÂπ≥Ê∞ëÊïôËÇ≤‰øÉËøõ‰ºö in Ding Xian (Ding County), Hebei, some 200 miles south of Beijing. The project was started in 1926 and lasted until the Japanese invasion of 1937. The county was to be a social laboratory in which to develop and demonstrate ways to raise the standard of living, health, political responsibility, and culture of the Chinese village. Although the program received financial aid from the Rockefeller and other American foundations, Yen and his team of experts aimed to develop affordable techniques and prototypes which could be all across China using mainly resources from within the village. They hoped to show that the causes of poverty, ignorance, sickness, and disorganization could be addressed without class warfare and that violent revolution was not necessary to change village life. The program In 1926, after developing successful literacy campaigns across the nation, mainly in cities, James Yen and the Mass Education Movement (MEM) decided to start programs in the countryside. The village of Zhaicheng, in Ding Xian (Ding County) in central Hebei, had started a program of local self-government nearly a decade before, and was chosen because of the welcome offered by village elders. The MEM started programs of literacy education, but in spite of original success, one villager explained to Yen, \\"Dr. Yen, I am grateful to know how to read, but my stomach is just as empty as my illiterate neighbor's.\\" Yen realized that literacy, in fact, no one approach, could address the village's problems. He then identified the \\"Four Weaknesses\\" of China as \\"poverty, ignorance, disease, and misgovernment,\\" and invited Chinese experts to come to live in Ding Xian and design experimental program to address each one of them: # The problem of \\"Ignorance\\" was to be addressed by village schools and cultural programs which included village drama. among others. # The problem of Poverty was to be addressed by farmers' cooperatives, improved agricultural techniques, seeds, and new breeds of plants and animals. # The problem of Health was addressed by a pyramidal structure in which Village Health Workers were trained to keep records, treat minor problems, give basic inoculations, and refer more serious cases to clinics in the market towns.C. C. Chen, Medicine in Rural China: A Personal Account (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1989) # Politics. As the work expanded from Zhaicheng village to encompass most of Ding Country, the MEM saw greater and greater need to address political problems such as taxation, land ownership, and corruption. in 1932, the Hebei provincial government turned political control of the county over to the MEM, creating the Hebei Institute for Political and Social Reconstruction (IPSR). The work at Ding Xian attracted nationwide attention and developed many new techniques for rural development which did not depend on central government control, violent revolution, or large infusions of foreign money. The National Rural Reconstruction Movement held three national conferences involving several hundred government and private projects. James Yen and Liang Shuming were the most prominent leaders. In 1937 the Japanese invasion of Hebei and North China ended the Ding Xian Experiment.

MESD 823 personnel onboard ABOT, 2009 An aerial view of KAAOT just after sunrise Iraqi sailors and marines guard KAAOT in its entirety with minimal support. KAAOT from ground level in Feb, 2007. Al Ba≈ürah Oil Terminal, commonly referred to as ABOT, is a strategically critical Iraqi offshore, deep sea crude oil marine loading terminal that lies approximately southeast of the Al-Faw Peninsula in the Persian Gulf. Along with its sister terminal, the Khawr al ‚ÄòAmƒ´yah Oil Terminal (ŸÖŸäŸÜÿßÿ° ÿÆŸàÿ± ÿßŸÑÿπŸÖŸäÿ©, alt. Khor al- Amaya Oil Terminal, KAAOT), the terminals provide the principal point of export for more than eighty percent of Iraq's gross domestic product , and all of the oil from the southern Ba≈ürah refinery. Crude oil produced for export from the southern Iraqi oilfields is carried through three diameter pipelines to the southern tip of the al-Faw Peninsula and then undersea to the ABOT() platform. One and two pipelines supply the KAAOT() platform. The ABOT facilities can transfer up to (Mbbl) of oil per day when all four of its supertanker berths operate at maximum capacity and has a maximum draft of . Three single-point mooring systems (SPM) were added in 2012, each with a design rating of (kbbl) of oil per day, and two more SPMs are planned to be operational by 2013 to increase total loading capacity to of oil per day. The KAAOT facility has a shallower depth and its two berths can accommodate Suezmax oil tankers with capacities up to or 200,000 DWT and has the capacity to transfer about of oil daily. History ABOT was originally named Mƒ´nƒÅ' al-Bakr Oil Terminal and was designed and commissioned into service by Brown and Root in 1974 with a design lifetime, with proper maintenance, of 20 years. In 2003, the current name ABOT was adopted. The facility was constructed with four berths capable of handling very large crude carrier type vessels (VLCC) and offloading per day through each of the berths. The ABOT suffered significant damage during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War; however, it remained in service until 1989, when Brown and Root attempted to refurbish it after the conclusion of that war. Work was stopped when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 and the facility was inflicted with further damage during the ensuing Gulf War. In addition, the platform was operated under the Oil-for-Food Programme for several years thereafter with minimal maintenance. The Mƒ´nƒÅ' Khawr al ‚ÄòAmƒ´yah Oil Terminal (KAAOT) was built in 1958 and had fallen into extreme disrepair and would require wholesale reconstruction to restore full capabilities . The shallow draft of its location, however, makes a reconstruction effort of questionable economic value. Refurbishment Under Coalition Forces In 2004, the ABOT platform was refurbished and upgraded under contract W9126G-04-D-0002, an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ), cost- plus award fee with an estimated not-to-exceed value of million. The contract was between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) of Fort Worth, TX and Parsons Iraqi Joint Venture (PIJV), Houston, TX. ABOT's capacity was more than doubled to offload up to of oil per day. Practical constraints in the upstream refinery and oil fields limit actual delivery below the designed maximum. Despite the work conducted, the dilapidated and fragile nature of the terminal was featured in an NPR story on June 20, 2009 and again on October 4, 2010. Engineers interviewed said that \\"they didn't even know just how bad the condition of the pipeline is; they didn't dare run it at full pressure for fear it would burst, and they didn't dare shut down the flow to fix it for fear that the weight of the ocean would implode it\\"; the most recent capacity tests were conducted nearly two decades earlier in 1991.Aging Oil Terminal Vital To Iraq's Economy : NPR Iraq Ministry of Oil Master Plan 2007 The Iraqi Ministry of Oil (MoO) Master Plan 2007 included the Iraq Crude Oil Export Expansion Project (ICOEEP) to expand the South Oil Company's export capacity from of oil per day (MMBOPD) to of oil per day by 2014. =Iraq Crude Oil Export Expansion Project (ICOEEP), Phase 1= On July 13, 2010 Foster Wheeler AG was awarded the front-end engineering & management contract for Phase 1 of the ICOEEP, Leighton Offshore was then awarded a US$733 million EPC contract with work commencing in November, 2010 for delivery in March, 2012 for a scope of work to include: * Installation of two parallel, outside diameter pipelines running onshore, through an onshore crossing, and then offshore to link with new single point mooring systems (SPM) * A third onshore crossing for future expansion * Installation of three SPMs with nameplate ratings of per day along with manifolds and subsea pipelines capable of servicing VLCCs - two operational and one spare * Fabrication and installation of a subsea valve manifold * Dredging to bury the pipelines and to provide adequate depth for VLCCs * Construction of onshore metering and manifold facilities at the FAO storage facility The \\"first oil ready for start-up\\" milestone was celebrated on February 12, 2012 with Iraq Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in attendance. The milestone marked the addition of barrels per day of export capacity via of onshore pipelines from the Al-Zubair pumping station to the FAO storage facility where eight new crude oil storage tanks, each with a capacity of , were brought online with another eight tanks close to operational; these 16 storage tanks represent 25% of the 64 tanks planned for in the ICOEEP. The crude oil then flows offshore through the new twin 48\\" pipelines to the new 600 MT subsea valve manifold for distribution to two single point mooring systems. Phase 1 completion will increase overall exports by 1.8 MMBOPD when both SPMs and all sixteen storage tanks are operational. In November, 2012 Leighton Offshore transferred operations of the completed ICOEEP installations. On March 7, 2012, the first tanker was berthed and loaded from one of the 900,000 bpd SPMs installed during Phase 1 of the ICOEEP. =Iraq Crude Oil Export Expansion Project (ICOEEP), Phase 2= The second phase of the ICOEEP added a central metering and management platform (CMMP), brought three SPMs online, and installed a fourth SPM. The scope of work included: * Central Metering and Manifold Platform (CMMP) * A , diameter pipeline near-shore * One additional single-point mooring system * Conversion of an existing spare SPM buoy to operational status * Replacement of the spare SPM buoy * Installation of a pig launcher The EPC contract for Phase 2's Central Metering and Manifold Platform (CMMP) was awarded to Italy's Saipem in October, 2011 with delivery expected in the fourth quarter of 2013; other Phase 2 facilities include connecting the ABOT platform to the new pipelines via the CMMP. =Iraq Crude Oil Export Facility Reconstruction Project (COEFRP), aka JICA Sealine Project= The Iraq Crude Oil Export Facility Reconstruction Project (COEFRP) was funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency and includes work to add a third diameter pipeline running from shore to the ABOT valve station. New pipelines will also be run from the ABOT valve station to the KAAOT valve station to supply a fifth SPM and the KAAOT loading facilities. In October, 2011, the South Oil Company awarded two contracts worth US$518 million and US$79.85 million to Leighton Offshore for delivery in January, 2013 with a scope of work running in parallel with Phase 1 that includes: * A third , diameter pipeline connecting onshore facilities to the offshore valve stations * Two offshore valve station platforms, one at ABOT and a second at KAAOT * One additional single-point mooring system Strategic role ABOT and KAAOT are major players in Iraq's eventual economic stability and therefore are considered one of the top terrorist targets in the world due to their strategic importance. The terminals maintain strict security and are guarded by both the Iraqi Navy and Marines and U.S. Forces including personnel from the U.S. Navy's Maritime Expeditionary Security Force, which falls under the Naval Expeditionary Combat Command. While under US control, the US units enforcing the warning and exclusion zones around ABOT and KAAOT including Maritime interdiction operations were conducted primarily by Patrol Forces Southwest Asia a component of the U.S. Coast Guard comprising Island class cutters and US Navy Patrol craft coastal. MESD 823 served on board ABOT to provide security and security training to Iraqi Sailors and Marines. On April 30, 2009 the Iraqi Navy assumed control of the Khawr al ‚ÄòAmƒ´yah Oil Terminal and on July 26, 2011 they assumed control of ABOT as well.

Even though sections are dual carriageway, the Appennine section is not at the standard laid down for E-roads in the European Agreement on Main International Traffic Arteries (which applies to E-routes). Plans to upgrade the entire route have existed since the late 1960s.http://www.stradeanas.it/index.php?/content/index/arg/grosseto_fano This project is significant, because the completed E78 would be the only fully grade-separated and fully dual carriageway route between the Tyrrhenean and Adriatic coasts in an area that runs from Rimini to Pescara. There are plans to create other similar links in the area.For instance an upgrade of SS76 between Perugia and Ancona and of SS77 between Foligno and Civitanova Marche. These would link to other expressways providing for a coast-to-coast link. See http://www.quadrilaterospa.it/docs/ilprogetto/ilprogetto.asp In the first phase of the project, the E78 expressway will consist of an upgrade of the existing Grosseto - Siena road, then run to the A1 at Bettolle.

Formed in 1931 and active until the November 10, 1937 suspension of political parties by the then president, Get√∫lio Vargas, the Frente mobilized Brazil's Afro-Descendant community for a project of racial equality. Desegregation campaigns and popular education focusing on literacy were just two of the ways the Frente engaged in activism. The party was organized by Arlindo Veiga dos Santos following the Revolution of 1930. It was the first national organization of Afro-Brazilians. The party spread from S√£o Paulo to most of the major states in Brazil including Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, Bahia, and Rio Grande do Sul. A majority of the chapters were located in S√£o Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio Grande do Sul. Many of the chapters were informal and lacked a connection to the main organization. Frente Negra Brasileira was very active within the community and provided social gatherings and services as well as addressing the political concerns of its members. On December 17, 1931, in the first year of its existence, the Frente Negra Brasileira achieved one of its first success stories, the desegregation of public skating rinks. This was following protest by the group to police and threats of violence if the rinks were not shut down. As a political party, the Frente Negra Brasileira also would run candidates for political office, and although they never successfully put a candidate in office they were able to dramatically increase the number of registered voters before the 1934 election. Outside of the political concerns addressed, Frente Negra Brasileira also provided services to its members including literacy and vocational classes, health clinics, jazz and samba bands, and legal services. On Sunday nights, the group would host a domingueira that was a meeting open to the public. These meetings would last roughly 4 hours and became a social gathering for members of the community. During these events, the first part was for business and the directors would speak about what was going on, but afterwards there was time for music and poetry. Throughout their existence, the Frente Negra Brasileira published a newspaper, A Voz da Ra√ßa (The Voice of the Race), which provided news about black communities in Brazil and around the world.

Zion Presbyterian Church is located in Sandy Springs, South Carolina, USA. It is a part of the PCUSA denomination and is located in the Foothills Presbytery of the Synod of South Atlantic. Background In the early 19th century, Sandy Springs residents, mainly Scotch-Irish pioneers, periodically gathered for a camp meeting at a spring located nearby; but for regular weekly worship, they traveled to Anderson's Presbyterian Church. In 1832, a request was made and granted to establish a local Presbyterian church, to be known as Sandy Spring Presbyterian Church. The church building, a frame structure, was erected at Mt. Zion's present site on land donated by Mr. Archibald McElroy. In 1842, the Presbytery changed the name to Mount Zion Presbyterian Church. Church records indicate that in 1834 the church had 40 members. During the Civil War years from 1861‚Äì1863, no records were kept, and some of the early records of the church were destroyed by fire. There were also years when the church was vacant (meaning that no minister served it in any capacity). In spite of this, the Sunday School was maintained. There are two known Civil War graves in the church cemetery. James Waddell Hillhouse (20 April 1822 - 22 July 1861), son of the Rev. Joseph Hillhouse, and Michael Alexander Bellotte (1 January 1830 - 24 July 1861), son of Jacob Bellotte, an elder in Mt. Zion's first session, died from injuries in the first Battle of Manassas. They served together in the 4th SC Regiment, and died from the accidental discharge of a shell. Change Of Location Hoping to increase the membership, the congregation of Mt. Zion voted in 1867 to move to a site near the railroad and about one half mile east of the original location. Later, on August 26, 1876, the building was sold, and the members decided to hold services at the old Grange Hall about three miles southwest of the Sandy Springs crossroads. In 1882, under the leadership of Dr. J. B. Adger and his son, Mr. John Adger, a drive was started to raise funds to construct a new church building. Mr. John Adger was instrumental in beginning the movement when he was successful in collecting $250.00, the first money contributed to the building of the present Mt. Zion Church. In 1884 a Building Committee was formed which consisted of the following men: T. R. Simpson, W. J. Erwin, Alfred Benjamin Bowden, James Dickson McElroy and T. E. Dickson. When the church was completed, the total cost in cash was $800.00. As was the custom in Presbyterian polity toward the end of the 19th century and the early 20th century, the church did not hesitate to call before the Session any member who was guilty of breaking a commandment. The accused party was given a chance to confess and ask forgiveness for his or her sin. After due consideration by the Session, a decision was made whether a suspension or vindication was in order. Records show that most parties confessed, asked forgiveness, and were vindicated. Major Times The United States entered World War I on 6 April 1917. President Woodrow Wilson had worked hard for the nation's peace but to no avail. It was his hope that the involvement of the United States might help to \\"make the world safe for democracy.\\" At this time the people of Mt. Zion displayed a high plane of patriotic sentiment. Young men volunteered for or were drafted into the armed forces. The women rolled bandages, made hospital garments, and took cookies, cakes, and sandwiches to soldiers who came through Sandy Springs on troop trains. When the Great Depression hit America. Banks closed, businesses failed, people were without jobs. The churches, as well as individuals, were affected keenly by this period of disaster and despair. \\"The Lord's acre\\" was encouraged by Mt. Zion. The farmer set aside a good acre of land, planted a crop on it, gave it special attention, sold the crop, and then gave all proceeds to the church. Times were hard and money scarce so this project was most beneficial to the financial status of the church. Expansion It was not until 1950 that plans for the Educational Building were drawn. Realization of the dream of expanded facilities came slowly. Construction was done on a time and materials basis as funds became available. Some labor was hired and the congregation donated some. The building of concrete blocks and brick veneer, which cost $8,000, is 54 feet long and 30 feet wide. It contains an assembly room, complete with cheerful fireplace, a kitchen, four Sunday school rooms and two rest rooms. Although the Educational Building had been completed nearly two years previously, it was not until August 4, 1957, that it was officially dedicated during a Homecoming commemorating the 125th anniversary of the founding of the church. In 1996, the church leased church property for a county park. The land was cleared, and a pavilion, playground, and walking track were built and are still enjoyed by the community today. Mt. Zion continues to be an active congregation and an active part of the Sandy Springs Community. Sources used *History - Mt.

Colombia is well-endowed with minerals and energy resources. It has the largest coal reserves in Latin America, and is second to Brazil in hydroelectric potential. Estimates of petroleum reserves in 1995 were . Colombia also possesses significant amounts of nickel and gold. Other important metals included platinum and silver, which were extracted in much smaller quantities. Colombia also produces copper, small amounts of iron ore, and bauxite. Nonmetallic mined minerals include salt, limestone, sulfur, gypsum, dolomite, barite, feldspar, clay, magnetite, mica, talcum, and marble. Colombia also produces most of the world's emeralds. Despite the variety of minerals available for exploitation, Colombia still had to import substances such as iron, copper, and aluminum to meet its industrial needs. Materials recovered by mining in the country include oil, with proved reserves of (2006 estimate) and natural gas, with annual production of 6.18 billion m3 (2004 estimate) and reserves of 114.4 billion m3 (1 January 2005 estimate).Unidad de Planeaci√≥n Minero Energ√©tica - UPME (2004), Bolet√≠n Estad√≠stico de Minas y Energ√≠a 1994 - 2004. PDF file in Spanish. Minerals‚Äîin particular coal, oil, and natural gas, but also emeralds, gold, and nickel‚Äîhave played an important role in Colombia's GDP and foreign trade in the last 20 years. Accounting for only 1.4 percent of GDP and 13 percent of total exports be tween 1980 and 1984, minerals represented about 5 percent of GDP and 42 percent of total exports in 2006. The minerals industry has compensated to a certain extent for the decreasing role of agriculture and has expanded the importance of commodities for the economy as a whole. Colombia is the world's leading source of emeralds, and illegal mining is commonplace. Illegal mining, especially of gold, has grown due to Colombia's aggressive counter narcotics policies, which increase the risks associated with the drug economy.International Crisis Group. \\"http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/latin-america/colombia/053-the-day- after-tomorrow-colombia-s-farc-and-the-end-of-the-conflict.pdf \\", CrisisGroup.org. 11 December 2014. Retrieved 11 December 2014. However, production of precious minerals is small scale despite high international prices for minerals such as gold.Roberto Steiner and Hern√°n Vallejo. \\"Mining and energy\\". In Colombia: A Country Study (Rex A. Hudson, ed.). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (2010).  History  Poporo Quimbaya and pestle. Phytomorphic (fruit-shaped) lime container, gold, 300 BC - 1000 AD Mining of kaolinite and hematite for pottery pigments started in what is today Colombia since the mid-late neolithic, with archaeological evidence of ceramic production and sedentary groups living in El Abra settlements and the Colombian Caribbean coast (near the towns of San Jacinto, Mons√∫, Puerto Chacho, and Puerto Hormiga archaeological site) beginning around the year 5940 BCE around the town of San Jacinto. This would place these pottery shards among the oldest ever recovered anywhere. The earliest examples of gold mining and goldwork have been attributed to the Tumaco people of the Pacific coast and date to around 325 BCE. Gold would play a pivotal role in luring the Spanish conquistadores to the area during the 16th century. Gold was considered sacred by most of the precolumbian civilizations of the area. In Muisca mythology, Gold (Chiminigagua) was considered itself a deity, and the force of creation. Copper mining was very important for the classic Quimbaya civilization, which developed the tumbaga alloy. Although significant in the colonial economy, it never commanded a large portion of Colombia's GDP in modern times. With the discovery and exploitation of large coal reserves, however, the role of mining in the national economy expanded in the late 1980s.  Mineral resources of Colombia = Oil  Petroleum production (red) and exports (black), 1960-2012 Pipeline map of Colombia, 2010 The discovery of of high-quality oil at the Cusiana and Cupiagua fields, about east of Bogot√°, has enabled Colombia to become a net oil exporter since 1986. The Transandino pipeline transports oil from Orito in the Department of Putumayo to the Pacific port of Tumaco in the Department of Nari√±o. Total crude oil production averages ; about is exported. The Pastrana government liberalized the petroleum investment policies, leading to an increase in exploration activity. Refining capacity cannot satisfy domestic demand, so some refined products, especially gasoline, must be imported. Plans for the construction of new refineries are under development.  Natural gas  While Colombia has vast hydroelectric potential, a prolonged drought in 1992 forced severe electricity rationing throughout the country until mid-1993. The consequences of the drought on electricity-generating capacity caused the government to commission the construction or upgrading of 10 thermoelectric power plants. Half will be coal-fired, and half will be fired by natural gas. The government also has begun awarding bids for the construction of a natural gas pipeline system that will extend from the country's extensive gas fields to its major population centers. Plans call for this project to make natural gas available to millions of Colombian households by the middle of the next decade. Starting in 2004, Colombia became a net energy exporter, exporting electricity to Ecuador and developing connections to Peru, Venezuela and Panama to export to those markets as well. The Trans-Caribbean pipeline connecting western Venezuela to Panama through Colombia was inaugurated by October, 2007, thanks to cooperation between presidents √Ålvaro Uribe of Colombia, Mart√≠n Torrijos of Panama and Hugo Ch√°vez of Venezuela.  Coal  Coal production (red) and exports (black), 1970-2012 Cerrej√≥n coal mine Colombia's coal output has increased consistently from 4 million tons in 1981 to 65.6 million tons in 2006, when it contributed 1.4 percent of the world's coal production. In 2006 Colombia accounted for 81 percent of the total coal production in Central and South America. Furthermore, 94 percent of Colombia's coal is of very good quality and is classified as hard, with high heat- generating capacity. Coal has been Colombia's second-largest export since 2001. The largest coal mines‚Äîand the ones that generate the most exports‚Äîare located in the north of the country, in the departments of La Guajira and Cesar. Cerrej√≥n is considered to be one of the largest open-pit coal mines in the world. The 2008 coal production in Cerrejon was calculated in 31.2 million tons. There are also smaller coal mines scattered throughout the rest of the nation. Since 2000 government participation in the production of coal has been decreasing, and there has been a shift to private domestic and foreign investors. Major changes have occurred in the institutional framework of the coal industry in recent years. In particular, in 2000 the government sold the stakes that Colombia Coal (Carbocol), a state-owned company, had in Cerrej√≥n, and the new mining code introduced in 2001 led the government to concentrate on its role as regulator through the Ministry of Mines and Energy.  Gold  The production of gold during 2008 was calculated at , with an increase of 34.2% with respect to the previous year.Investment opportunities in Colombian mining industry As of 2009, La Colosa mining project (to be exploited by AngloGold Ashanti) near Cajamarca, Tolima is in planning phase, with calculated reserves of 12.9 million ounces. However, there is controversy about the possible environmental damage. In the Colombian economy, Gold is the most important metal in terms of short-term revenues.  Silver  Platina  Copper  Nickel  The Cerro Matoso nickel mine, located in Montel√≠bano, C√≥rdoba in northern Colombia, combines a lateritic nickel ore deposit with a low cost ferronickel smelter. It produces an average of 52,000 tons of nickel/year, which places this mine in the second place of nickel producers worldwide. Cerromatoso is currently owned by BHP Billiton. Disagreement among the direction and the trade union workers, with frequent strikes produced heavy losses during 2008  Halite  Halite hand-carved Salt Cathedral of Zipaquir√° Halite was explored by the Precolumbian cultures such as the Muisca, as an important trade product.Cardale de Schrimpff, Marianne: Bolet√≠n Museo del Oro , Banco de la Rep√∫blica, Colombia , No. 1, enero-abril de 1978, p. 39-41 Early halite mining is dated about 5th century BC. The traditional halite mining was described by Alexander von Humboldt during his visit to Zipaquira in 1801.\\"Memoria razonada de las salinas de Zipaquir√°\\", Alexander von Humboldt, Ed. Ep√≠grafe, con el respaldo de Colciencias, referenciado por Fundaci√≥n Editorial Ep√≠grafe , Colombia, 2003 Nowadays, the Zipaquir√° halite mine contains the Salt Cathedral of Zipaquir√°, entirely hand-carved in halite, including the religious icons, ornaments and architectural details; the Salt Park and the national mineralogy museum.  Gemstones  Gachal√° Emerald Colombia is the main producer of finer quality emeralds worldwide. Colombia produced 2.7 Mcarats (540 kg) of emeralds during 2008. Emerald mines are located both in the Boyac√° and Cundinamarca Departments. Colombian emeralds constitute 50-95% of the world production, the numbers depending on the year, source and emeralds grade.  Relevance  The Colombian mining industry remains as one of the most dynamic and promising sectors of the Colombian economy, in just one year the investment has reached record figures in excess of two billion dollars and the trend in the short term is not reversed. The mining industry contributes with the economic growth and social development and the development of the regions where the activity is legally established. In addition this demonstrates that the contribution in the social and environmental component is higher than the industry average.Colombia mining - international mining show 2009 Government efforts to expand mining in Colombia were needed to encourage private sector investment. In the late 1980s, much of Colombia remained inadequately charted, and reserve estimates were considered only marginally reliable. The government set a policy of developing infrastructure (roads, electricity, and communications), providing technical assistance, and encouraging sound credit and legal policies to minimize problems with land titling. Through joint ventures and the promotion of small mining companies, government officials believed that the mining sector could contribute more to national employment, income, and wealth.  Human rights and crime  According to a 2013 U.S. Department of Labor report on the worst forms of child labor and labor conditions around the world, the Colombian mining industry has been known to employ underage children. The report indicated that Colombia's industrial sector employed 20% of the working children who were aged 5 to 14 years old. However, and despite the government's participation in a \\"4-year, $9 million project to combat child labor and improve workplace health and safety in mining\\", children continue to engage in child labor. In fact, the Bureau of International Labor Affairs issued a List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor in December 2014 where Colombia was mentioned for its use of underage children in brick, coal, gold and emerald mining.List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor Mining infrastructure is a common target of terrorist attacks, specially the oil and gas pipelines, mainly by the Farc and ELN guerrillas. The mining companies have been implicated in extortion payments to guerrillas in exchange for access to mining locations.El Colombiano: Eln Cupola: 40 years for Machuca, March 8, 2007 The Ca√±o Lim√≥n- Cove√±as pipeline, which stretches 780 km from the Ca√±o Lim√≥n to the Atlantic port of Cove√±as, has come under heavy attack, including 170 attacks in 2002 alone, The pipeline remained out of operation for 266 days of that year and the government estimates that these bombings reduced the GDP of Colombia by 0.5%. The bombings, which have occurred on average once every 5 days, have caused substantial environmental damage, often in fragile rainforests and jungles. On October 14, 1998, a pipeline exploded because of bombs placed by ELN guerrillas. The burning oil spread fire across the Machuca village near Segovia, Antioquia. 85 peasants died and over 30 were injured. On the morning of December 13, 1998, after two days of combat between the army protecting the pipelines and the FARC, a Colombian Air Force helicopter carried out an air attack against guerrillas near the village of Santo Domingo, including the use of cluster-bombs. After the bombing was over, the bodies of seventeen civilians were found in Santo Domingo, including seven children. The case was subsequently handed over to a Colombian military court, with convictions of 31 years of prison for the accused. The decision called for the case to be judged in civil court and for comprehensive reparations to the victims.

He was raised in Montevideo, Uruguay, and lived in the United States since 1945. Life Antonio Rudolfo Frasconi was born 28 April 1919 on a boat between Argentina & Uruguay and was raised in Montevideo, Uruguay. He had parents of Italian descent. They had moved to South America during World War I. Frasconi's mother managed a restaurant whilst his father was frequently unemployed. Frasconi frequently quotes his mother and her view of his talents. He said that his mother talked of art at the church where she was brought up as if it had been done by God rather than man. She felt that if Frasconi had been born with a gift, he would already be a famous artist rather than working like her each day. His mother worked in the restaurant, cared for Frasconi and his two sisters and still found time to be a seamstress By the age of twelve, he was learning a trade at a printers after abandoning a course at C√≠rculo de Bellas Artes. During his teenage years he admired Gustave Dor√© and Goya, whilst indulging in creating caricatures of political figures. During the war, an exhibition of impressionism and post-impression was organised by the French in Latin America. Artists such as Van Gogh and C√©zanne captured his imagination. However it was the woodcuts of Paul Gauguin that he was attracted to most. Frasconi says he became intrigued by American writers and musicians. He would hear Jazz on the radio and read American authors like Walt Whitman. Frasconi moved to the United States in 1945 at the end of World War II. He worked as a gardener and as a guard at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art. It was at that museum that he had his first dedicated show. His recognition was beginning to grow and within twelve months he had a similar show at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. Frasconi was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1952. In 1955, Frasconi's woodcuts were exhibited at the Summit Art Association, now known as Visual Arts Center of New Jersey, in Summit, NJ. This show was an extensive traveling exhibition organized by the Smithsonian Institution. In 1959 he was a runner-up for the Caldecott Medal from the U.S. children's librarians, which annually honors the illustrator of the best American picture book for children. Thus The House That Jack Built, which he also wrote, is retrospectively termed a Caldecott Honor Book. In 1962 Frasconi won a Horn Book Fanfare award for The Snow and the Sun - La Nieve y el Sol a book he had created in two languages. He has frequently produced multilingual books. Also in 1962, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1969. In 1982 Frasconi was the Distinguished Teaching Professor of Visual Arts at the State University of New York at Purchase. Frasconi's students have included Martha Zelt, Adrian Lee Kellard and Ron Rocco. Between 1981 and 1986 he created a series of woodcuts under the name \\"Los desaparecidos\\" (The Disappeared). This series refers directly to the people who were tortured and killed during the Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay. Antonio Frasconi died on 8 January 2013.

It was the first professional body set up for women working in all areas of engineering, predating the Society of Women Engineers by around 30 years. History The society was formed on 23rd June 1919, after the First World War, during which many women had taken up roles in engineering to replace men who were involved in the military effort. While it had been seen as necessary to bring women into engineering to fill the gap left by men joining the armed forces, government, employers and trades unions were against the continuing employment of women after the war. The Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act 1919 gave soldiers returning from World War I their pre-war jobs back and meant many women could no longer work in roles they were employed to fill during the war. This led a group of seven women, including Lady Katharine Parsons, her daughter Rachel Parsons, Lady Margaret Moir, and Laura Annie Willson, to form the Women's Engineering Society, with the aim of enabling women to gain training, jobs and acceptance. The Society's first Secretary was Caroline Haslett. Early members in the 1920s and 1930s, included Verena Holmes, Hilda Lyon, Margaret Partridge and Margaret Rowbotham. Pilot and engineer, Amy Johnson, who was the first woman to fly solo from the United Kingdom to Australia, was a member of WES and served as president between 1935-37. A registry of members from 1935 shows there were members from across the world, such as the United States of America, including sociologist and industrial engineer Lillian Gilbreth, and Germany, including Asta Hampe and Ilse Knot-ter Meer. The society celebrated its 95th year in 2014 with the launch of International Women in Engineering Day on 23 June 2014. It celebrated its centenary in 2019 with the launch of the WES Centenary Trail, a project to highlight the historic stories of women engineers. Work and campaigns The Society is a company limited by guarantee 162096 registered at Companies House and is a charity 1008913 registered at the Charity Commission. Society members have advised the UK government on evolving employment practices for women. Constituted as a professional society with membership grades based on qualification and experience, the society promotes the study and practice of engineering and allied sciences among women. WES is represented by groups. The work of the groups focuses on: * support to members and women engineers in general, * encouragement of women to study engineering and take up engineering careers, * promotion of corporate gender diversity, * speaking as the collective voice of women engineers.  Journal  Caroline Haslett edited the society's journal The Woman Engineer in its early years. The journal contained technical articles in its early years. It now contains articles which give readers a view of work in engineering disciplines and celebrates the achievements of women. The digital archive of the journal is held by the Institution of Engineering and Technology.  Conferences  The Women's Engineering Society holds an annual conference, a student conference and regional workshops and networking events.  Outreach to schools  WES members volunteer in schools to inspire girls to take up engineering and allied science careers. In 1969, President Verena Holmes left a legacy to fund an annual lecture to inspire school girls. Run by the Verena Holmes Trust, the first lecture tour was in 1969 during the first UK Women in Engineering Year. It was delivered at various venues to children aged nine to eleven to encourage their interest in engineering, Women's Engineering Society: Role Models; accessed 24 February 2013]Verena Holmes Lecture, wes.org.uk; accessed 22 June 2015. The lectures were given by leading engineers. Mary Kendrick gave the lecture in 1981. The programme is closed. In 2014 WES set up an outreach programme called Magnificent Women (and their flying machines) which replicates? the work that women did during the First World War in making aircraft wings, and this was aimed at secondary school girls. Members provided the 'technical women power' for the WISE Buses that were launched following the WISE Year in 1984. They continue to undertake activities in schools, often through the UK STEM Ambassador scheme.  MentorSET  MentorSET is a mentoring scheme for engineers, inspired by the WES President Petra Gratton (n√©e Godwin) in 2000. The scheme was a collaborative project with national network of women scientists (AWISE). It was a mentoring scheme to help women in their career and to support them back into engineering after a career break. MentorSET has been funded by DTI, the UK Resource Centre for Women in SET, and BAE Systems. In 2015 the MentorSET programme was relaunched with funding from DECC, now BEIS and Women in Nuclear and is now relevant to women working in science and technology as well as engineering. Membership Members are drawn from women who have entered the profession through routes varying from traditional apprenticeship to higher education leading to graduate and further degrees. The participation of male engineers in the society is encouraged. Current membership exceeds 1000 individuals and over 35 corporate and education partners.

SR 619 provides a cross-county connector as well as a major artery for commuters. SR 619 is known by four names: Linton Hall Road, Bristow Road, Joplin Road, and Fuller Heights Road. There are also two short concurrencies: one with SR 234 Old in Independent Hill, and one with Fuller Military Road on the border of Marine Corps Base Quantico.  Route description =Linton Hall Road Linton Hall Road starts out at the intersection with US 29 (Lee Highway) and SR 55 (John Marshall Highway). This intersection is part of the Gainesville Interchange project. Gallerher Road has been renamed SR 55 (John Marshall Highway),Gainesville Improvements Retrieved October 9, 2010 and the former SR 55 between Gallerher and U.S. 29 is currently a dead end, and will become a cul-de-sac, without access to U.S. 29. Linton Hall Road starts out as a six-lane divided highway passing the Virginia Gateway retail development to the north. As SR 674 (Wellington Road) is passed, there is empty land to the northeast (until SR 1040, Limestone Drive). This land will become part of the Virginia Gateway Center.Interactive map of Virginia Gateway Retrieved September 27, 2009 At Glenkirk Road, Linton Hall Road reduces to a four-lane divided highway. Linton Hall Road passes by many more subdivisions, including Victory Lakes and Braemar in Bristow on its way to SR 28 (Nokesville Road). Linton Hall Road has been widened from two lanes undivided to four lanes divided from SR 675 (Glenkirk Road) to SR 621 (Devlin Road) by VDOT.VDOT Completes Linton Hall Road Widening Retrieved October 27, 2009 Prince William County was working on a project to widen Linton Hall Road from two lanes to four from Devlin Road to SR 28 (Nokesville Road).FY 2010-2015 Capital Improvement Program Retrieved October 27, 2009 This project is now complete. Part of the project includes straightening out Linton Hall Road near Braemar. This has left behind two segments of the old alignment of SR 619, named Devlins Grove Place and Braemar Village Plaza. Bristow Road On the other side of SR 28, SR 619 becomes Bristow Road and reduces to two lanes undivided. It passes through the center of the original town of Bristow, crosses Southern Railway tracks (that are also used by the Virginia Railway Express commuter service). Bristow Road then passes to the southwest of Manassas Regional Airport and intersects with SR 611 (Valley View Drive), which leads one to the new Bristow post office and to the unincorporated town of Aden. Soon after it intersects in Brentsville with SR 692, Lucasville Road, which will take one back to the south Manassas area. Near this location is where Cedar Run and Broad Run merge to form the Occoquan River. Once past the Cedar Run bridge, SR 619 continues past homes on large lots, farmland, and forest on its way to Independent Hill. It is there where it meets Independent Hill Road, part of SR 234 Old. When SR 234 (Dumfries Road) was widened to four lanes divided, and relocated slightly north, the old Dumfries Road was renamed Independent Hill Road, and the rest was made an extension of Bristow Road, ironically signed as SR-619. After SR 619 turns right, unposted, onto Joplin Road, Bristow Road continues (also as SR-619) and intersects with the current SR 234, Dumfries Road. Joplin Road Joplin Road starts out as a two-lane undivided road in Independent Hill at an intersection with Bristow Road. It starts out in a southerly direction, soon crossing SR 646 (Aden Road) on its way out of town. It soon starts its life as the border between Prince William Forest Park and Marine Corps Base Quantico. The road curves to the southeast, following the border between the park and the base. To the north, the park gives way to what is left of the town of Joplin. After a park entrance, there is another group of homes, and another park entrance. After that Joplin Road widens to four lanes divided, and almost immediately has an interchange with Interstate 95. It stays four lanes divided until it comes to an intersection with US 1. This is the end of Joplin Road. Fuller Heights Road Many mapping agencies consider that SR 619 follows Fuller Military Road. However, the legislature of the State of Virginia in 1983 released a report that concluded that Fuller Road is part of Marine Corps Base Quantico, a part of the U.S. Government, and as such, the Virginia Department of Transportation has not given Fuller Road any state route designation. Instead, Fuller Heights Road, which services a part of the town of Triangle has been designated as part of SR 619. The gate on Fuller Military Road for Marine Corps Base Quantico is after the intersection with Fuller Heights Road, so residents using SR 619 are not affected.Fuller Rd. Governed By US Government (1983 joint subcommittee report) Retrieved October 30, 2009Google Earth Desktop application of corner of Windsor Dr. & Fuller Heights Rd., Triangle, Virginia Retrieved October 31, 2009 There is even confusion by the Marines about SR 619. They released maps of Fuller Military Road in 2008 that showed that SR 619 was Fuller Road, and not Fuller Heights Road.Main (Fuller Road) Gate improvements begin on or about May 1st 2008 Retrieved November 2, 2009 After the intersection with US 1, SR 619 continues on Fuller Road for one block, and then immediately turns onto Fuller Heights Road as a two-lane undivided roadway. This route continues until the intersection with SR 761 (Windsor Road), where SR 619 terminates. South is a gate into the Marine Corps base, and north is more housing in Triangle. =Future construction= The Prince William County Board of Supervisors has gotten jurisdiction and passed a resolutionPrince William Resolution 09-773 dated September 17, 2009; document dated October 6, 2009. Pp. 1 & 5 Retrieved November 6, 2009 to widen the portion of Fuller Road between US 1 and Fuller Heights Road to four lanes divided, providing better access to both Triangle and Marine Corps Base Quantico. History=Linton Hall RoadName= Linton Hall Road was named after Linton Hall Military School, (later renamed Linton Hall School.) The school was named after a Catholic nun, Sister Baptista Linton, in honor of the land she donated to the church for the education of poor children.Linton Hall School ~ History Retrieved October 28, 2009 =Construction= Linton Hall Road was two lanes up until 2005. The VDOT project widened it to four or six lanes from US 29 to Devlin Road, and the Prince William County project widened it to four lanes divided from there to SR 28. Bristow Road Bristow Road is named after the town at one of its ends, Bristow, Virginia. The road was always a two-lane undivided road to Independent Hill, and stopped at SR 234 (Dumfries Road). When SR 234 was widened and relocated north, most of Dumfries Road was renamed as an extension of Bristow Road. Now, Bristow Road extends all the way to the new alignment of SR 234, but not all of it is part of SR 619. See Virginia State Route 234 Old (Independent Hill) for more details.

It lies in the south-central portion of the country, twelve kilometers from where the Santa Maria River meets the Pacific Ocean. Archaeologists have asserted that it was a nucleated agricultural village presumed to have thrived during the Late Occupation Sequence until the Spanish conquest. It was probably an egalitarian society along with other sites from the same region and time period (such as Cerro Mangote). It contains domestic features including cemeteries, middens, and ancient houses. The area includes two main periods portrayed by more recent settlement areas that are stratified above an earlier cemetery. Systematic pedestrian surveys published in an article by Richard E. Cooke in 1979 hypothesize that the original ancient habitat might have covered at least 45 hectares (Hallar, 2004). Artifacts Sitio Sierra contains some gold artifacts that are considered some of the oldest of the region. The gold pieces have been described as probably being cut from molded flat sheets, and then spiraled into ornaments. Spondylus (shellfish) found at the site are considered especially important because of the nutritional benefits that they probably provided for the inhabitants. Evidence in the middens and around the site also suggest the transformation of shells into tools and goods. A large amount of red beads made from the shells are found throughout the site according to a study done by Sanchez and Herrera in 1995. Sitio Sierra is the only site in Panama that contains prismatic blade production while lacking any access to chert projections. This causes scientists to infer a system of trade with other local cities that have produced evidence for these resources. Based on chipped rocks found in association with other stone tools in the area, archaeologists hypothesize that these people probably were accustomed to sharpening and re-sharpening axes, but no artifacts have been found in association with axe manufacturing. This was hypothesized by Richard Cooke in 1979. His articles also support the possibility of stone-tool trade between ancient Panamanian cities. There have been extensive excavations under an elliptical structure that was probably a house. Scientists have revealed a cemetery that consists of 25 individuals along with other items such as stingray spines, fool‚Äôs gold (pyrite), axes, and pottery from the La Mula phase (AD 250). Archaeologists have speculated whether there are any religious or ideological connections with the goods found among the bodies. Various inconsistencies of these items occur between this site and other local sites according to research done by Mikael Haller in 2004. Some scientists suggest that the hoard of goods represent differences in social ranks, while others suggest that the goods might be indicators of occupation or sex rather than rank.  Diet  The faunal fossils found in the area belong mostly to estuarine fish supporting marine diet concentrations approaching as high as 73%. The presence of non-estuarine fossil evidence supports the claim that the Paleo-Indian peoples tapped into their fresh-water resources for food in addition to marine selections from Parita Bay. Non- estuarine remains have been calculated to account for as much as 11% of the diet. In addition, fossil evidence for over 400 species of birds and other animals include the orange-chinned parakeet (Brotogeris jugularis), crested bobwhite (Colinus cristatus), possible mangrove cuckoo (Coccyzus minor), groove-billed ani (Crotophaga sulcirostris), great-tailed grackle (Cassidix mexicanus), giant toad (Bufo marinus), a lizard (Ameiva ameiva), Green Iguana (Iguana iguana), mud turtle (Kinosternon spp.), painted terrapin (Chrysemys scripta), several species of shark (superorder Selachimorpha), estuarine fishes, non-estuarine marine fishes, freshwater fish, mangrove and mudflat mollusks, and mudflat crabs (Haller 2004). In addition to the consumption of fish and terrestrial animals, most of the macrobotanical remains are from maize. Maize was probably the most important and steady source of botanical food in the area. After extensive bone analysis, archaeologists have hypothesized that by the time Sitio Sierra was occupied by larger populations in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, maize had become a dominant source of nutrition compared to other ancient Panamanian cities that flourished at the same time such as Cerro Mangote.  Additional questions and hypothesis  Sitio Sierra is thought by archaeologists to have been a nice location for settlement because of its multiple natural resources for fishing, and its well vegetated surroundings that supported habitats for terrestrial animals plants. Its relatively large population of around 1,000‚Äì2,000 occupants would have made it one of the most densely populated areas in the region at that time. One small, oval-shaped foundation found on the site contains some rather novel and innovative amenities including roofing made from palm, and ovens made from clay and rocks. There is strong evidence for deforestation occurring in the area approximately during the 1st century. Since marine sources account for the largest food resource for Sitio Sierra, scientists ponder how these fish would be transferred over 12 kilometers along the Santa Maria River without rotting. One claim is that these people must have had some knowledge of food preservation, and the use of salt as a preservative. Salt may have been traded between several coastal sites for this reason. During the early to late pre- ceramic periods (4,000‚Äì1,200 BCE), several Panamanian villages located in the Partia Bay were occupied simultaneously. These findings point to population increases in the area, and the transition of sites like Sitio Sierra from small habitats to large nucleated villages. Scientists speculate whether this contributed to the environmental degradation observed in the site's stratigraphy. Another hypothesis supported by isotopic evidence at the site suggests that the people of Sitio Sierra practiced slash and burn farming techniques that may have contributed to soil infertility and the loss of vegetation. Another curious element of Sitio Sierra is the large amount, and variety of bird fossils that cover the site. Many of the birds are now either extinct, or have habitats that are only observed in other regions of South America. Scientists ponder whether the birds had some religious or ideological complexities.  Other related sites  Two rock middens located about 10 kilometers closer to the Pacific Ocean named Vampiros-1 and Vampiros-2 are thought to have been occupied anywhere from 7,000 to 11,500 BP. Scientists speculate whether it was used for the preparation of fish or for travel purposes as an ancient Paleo-Indian hotel. People may have lived in this area during Sitio Sierra's occupation as well, but it is more likely that the site was used as a relay point to preserve fish with salting techniques for the long walk or canoe ride back to the inland village(s). Studies done with aerial photography suggest that Vampiros-1 and Vampiros-2 were probably on the ocean shoreline during the time of Sitio Sierra's occupation. There is speculation that the Vampiros sites could have been later surrounding villages' original habitats, and scarce resources might have caused these people to move further inland at some point to gain the stability and sustenance of multiple resources. No terrestrial bones have been found in the older strata at Vampiros-1 or Vampiros-2.  References  *Haller, Mikael (2004).

It was a 2 channel amp; however, it had three sets of speaker connections; those powered selected by buttons. At 8 ohms, the amp could put out 65 Watts per channel RMS (90 Watts per channel RMS at 4 ohms), delivering superb high fidelity sound with exceptional tone quality. Unlike many amps of this time, however, the TRM-800 was stable at lower impedances than 8 ohms; down to 4 ohms. The TRM-800's frequency response ranges 10Hz to 40.000 Hz ¬±1 dB with T.H.D. less than 0.1% at rated output. Its preamplifier and main amplifier were separable for multi-channel amplifier systems. The amp has internal circuit breakers which prevent it from clipping or overheating. Its power consumption is 250 watts (according to label). For equalization it has only a bass and a treble knob; however the frequency of these are selectable; between 250 and 500 Hertz for the bass, and between 2.5 and 5 kHz for the treble. It also has a high, low, and a subsonic filter. There are two excellent phono stages; phono 2 is provided with impedance matching selection, for using different types of cartridges (MC/MM).

The technique was first described by John C. Reynolds in his 1972 paper, \\"Definitional Interpreters for Higher-Order Programming Languages\\". Reynolds' observation was that a given program contains only finitely many function abstractions, so that each can be assigned and replaced by a unique identifier. Every function application within the program is then replaced by a call to the apply function with the function identifier as the first argument. The apply function's only job is to dispatch on this first argument, and then perform the instructions denoted by the function identifier on the remaining arguments. One complication to this basic idea is that function abstractions may reference free variables. In such situations, defunctionalization must be preceded by closure conversion (lambda lifting), so that any free variables of a function abstraction are passed as extra arguments to apply. In addition, if closures are supported as first-class values, it becomes necessary to represent these captured bindings by creating data structures. Instead of having a single apply function dispatch on all function abstractions in a program, various kinds of control flow analysis (including simple distinctions based on arity or type signature) can be employed to determine which function(s) may be called at each function application site, and a specialized apply function may be referenced instead. Alternately, the target language may support indirect calls through function pointers, which may be more efficient and extensible than a dispatch-based approach. Besides its use as a compilation technique for higher-order functional languages, defunctionalization has been studied (particularly by Olivier Danvy and collaborators) as a way of mechanically transforming interpreters into abstract machines. Defunctionalization is also related to the technique from object-oriented programming of representing functions by function objects (as an alternative to closures). Example This is an example given by Olivier Danvy, translated to Haskell: Given the Tree datatype: data Tree a = Leaf a  Node (Tree a) (Tree a) We will defunctionalize the following program: cons :: a -> [a] -> [a] cons x xs = x : xs o :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c o f g x = f (g x) flatten :: Tree t -> [t] flatten t = walk t [] walk :: Tree t -> [t] -> [t] walk (Leaf x) = cons x walk (Node t1 t2) = o (walk t1) (walk t2) We defunctionalize by replacing all higher-order functions (in this case, \`o\` is the only higher-order function) with a value of the \`Lam\` datatype, and instead of calling them directly, we introduce an \`apply\` function that interprets the datatype: data Lam a = LamCons a  LamO (Lam a) (Lam a) apply :: Lam a -> [a] -> [a] apply (LamCons x) xs = x : xs apply (LamO f1 f2) xs = apply f1 (apply f2 xs) cons_def :: a -> Lam a cons_def x = LamCons x o_def :: Lam a -> Lam a -> Lam a o_def f1 f2 = LamO f1 f2 flatten_def :: Tree t -> [t] flatten_def t = apply (walk_def t) [] walk_def :: Tree t -> Lam t walk_def (Leaf x) = cons_def x walk_def (Node t1 t2) = o_def (walk_def t1) (walk_def t2) See also * Closure conversion * Partial evaluation References * * (More comprehensive version: Technical Report BRICS-RS-01-23) * (Also available as Technical Report BRICS-RS-07-7)  External links  * Defunctionalization (Programming Languages).

It failed to gain any orders but was developed into the larger four-seat MS.760 Paris. Development The Fleuret was designed and built to compete in an order for the French Air Force for a two-seat jet trainer. It was a side-by-side low mid-wing cantilever monoplane with a T-tail and powered by two 800 lbf (3.6kn) Turbomeca Marbor√© II turbojets. The prototype with French test registration F-ZWRS first flew on 29 January 1953. The aircraft was not ordered with the Air Force buying the Fouga CM.170 Magister instead and only one Fleuret was built. The Fleuret II an enlarged four-seat development was designed and produced as the MS.760 Paris. Indian Air Force Tests In March 1954, the sole prototype MS.755 was disassembled, crated and shipped to Begumpet Air Force Station, India, for tropical weather and trainer-suitability trials with the Indian Air Force. The audio memoirs of IAF Wing Commander Donald George Michael detail how Morane- Saulnier's Chief Test Pilot, Monsieur Jean Cliquet, and a team of 4 or 5 technicians accompanied the aircraft. The assigned IAF senior pilots were impressed with the MS.755 as a trainer, and ran a series of flight instruction tests where low time students with only 10 hours total flying experience transitioned to the jet and soloed with no problems. This led to further tests where zero-time students were taught to fly on the MS.755, and later on the two-place DH Vampire. During a flight early in the program, the two IAF senior pilots caused concern with Morane-Saulnier personnel when they pulled 8.5 Gs out of a dive. This was a significantly higher loading than the factory test pilots had reached. The engines were immediately replaced with spares and sent to France for analysis, but it was determined that no damage had taken place to either the engines or the airframe. The IAF tests of the MS.755 ended in June 1954 and the aircraft was then crated and shipped back to France.

Biography  Louise Nippierd was born and raised in England and moved to Norway with her Norwegian journalist mother and English father in 1967. Her father was a Commander in the Royal Navy on a 3-year contract with NATO in B√¶rum. During her first two years in Norway, Nippierd attended St. George's British School in B√¶rum, while her three siblings continued on at different boarding schools in England. In 1969 the family decided to stay in Norway, and Nippierd started at Smestad Primary SchoolSmestad.gs.oslo.no in Oslo, where several members of the Norwegian Royal Family, including King Harald V and Crown Prince Haakon Magnus, have also been pupils. Nippierd took a goldsmith course in 1990 at the Elvebakken videreg√•ende skole College, and in 1991 she enrolled at the Metal Department of the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry (now Oslo National Academy of the Arts), where she gained a Master's Degree in 1996. Also in 1996, she founded the studio community NB 13, which she ran for 10 years and shared with other artist colleagues, including Andrew J. Barton. Between 1997 and 2005 Nippierd was a guest teacher at the Oslo National Academy of the Arts, teaching courses in anodizing aluminium. Nippierd's works have been purchased by several institutions, including Norsk Kulturr√•d Arts Council Norway.Norsk kulturr√•d ‚Äì √•rsmelding 2004. page 48 and a commission for two small sculptures for the Royal Caribbean cruise ship Jewel of the Seas.  Artistic Outlook  Jewellery has traditionally been marketed purely in an aesthetic and decorative function, but Louise Nippierd also gives her jewellery an inherent ambiguity as the carrier of a deeper message.Norske Kunsthaandverkere Norwegian Association of Arts & Crafts ‚Äì Louise Nippierd, Artist of the Month, June 2006 (in Norwegian). Her projects have a socio- political dimension, touching on issues such as racism, homosexuality, animal rights and eating disorders.Artitude 2008, pp. 5‚Äì6; 26 Pratt, Rosalind. MillenniBrum. Birmingham Post 2000 May 3 article about the Virtual Gallery of Contemporary Jewellery, using Nippierd's work on anorexia as an illustration She attributes her concern with the marginalized groups in society to her own marginalized childhood as an English-speaking child in Norway.  Artistic Materials  Nippierd first started working with aluminium in 1994 and was very quickly fascinated by all the possibilities this material has, due to its light weight and ability to be coloured by anodizing. She specialised in this medium in her Master's Degree work and has subsequently gained an international reputation for her large anodized aluminium body- sculptures.Shape Swedish edition 2006,issue 1, page 20.

The trail passes through and connects Chicago's four major lakefront parks along with various beaches and recreational amenities. It also serves as a route for bicycle, skateboard and personal transporter commuters. On busy summer days 70,000 people use the trail. The LFT is located wholly within the Chicago city limits and spans from 7100 South/2560 East to 5800 North/1000 West. It is a dedicated-use path, although frequent intersections do pose a threat to path users. These intersections are clearly signed both to path users and motorists. From north to south, it runs through Lincoln Park, Grant Park, Burnham Park, and Jackson Park. History In 1963, Mayor Richard J. Daley designated the LFT as the city's first official bike path. Over the years it grew in popularity. In 2017 and 2018 the Trail Separation Project sought to add capacity and increase safety by providing separation of bike and foot traffic lanes, utilizing both widened, dedicated lanes and in some areas newly constructed and separately dedicated path sections. Additional improvement is sought by constructing the Navy Pier Flyover, basically a dedicated bridge over the Chicago River. From Wacker Drive to Illinois Street the Lakefront Trail shares the pedestrian sidewalk on lower-level Lake Shore Drive. In order to reduce the conflicts between pedestrian and bicyclists, and avoid the very busy intersections at Illinois Street and Grand Avenue, the Chicago Department of Transportation has been designing the Navy Pier Flyover since 2000. This bridge will run alongside the upper level of Lake Shore Drive from north of the Ohio Street Beach to Illinois Street, and then alongside the lower level of Lake Shore Drive as it crosses the Chicago River, with an exit in the middle serving Navy Pier and DuSable Park.Navy Pier Flyover presentation Construction began in spring 2014 and will continue until Spring 2020.Navy Pier Flyover website The project has now experienced multiple delays and is now expected to be completed by Spring 2020.  Attractions  Some attractions along the path (listed from south to north) are the South Shore Cultural Center, the Museum of Science and Industry, McCormick Place, Soldier Field, Chicago's Museum Campus, Monroe Harbor, Navy Pier, Belmont Harbor, and the Waveland Clock Tower. The Lakefront Trail connects most of the Chicago beaches and three skate parks (31st Street, Grant Park, Wilson Avenue). Several dog parks are accessible from the trail.  Maintenance  Path maintenance is provided by the Chicago Park District. The Lakefront Trail is open 24 hours a day, but the parks and beaches along the path close at 11 PM.

It is located on both banks of the Saint-Esprit River, a tributary of the L'Assomption River. History The area's first settlers arrived at the end of 18th century and were mostly from L'Ange-Gardien, Beauport, and Saint- Sulpice. Originally, the area was identified as the Rivi√®re-Saint-Esprit or Grand-Saint-Esprit Concession. In 1808, the Parish of Saint-Ours-du-Saint- Esprit was founded, however after 1838, the parish name was shortened to just Saint-Esprit to avoid confusion with another parish called Saint-Ours in the Diocese of Montreal. In 1852, its post office opened and in 1855, the Parish Municipality of Saint-Ours-du-Saint-Esprit was formed. A century later in 1956, it followed the parish by also shortening its name to Saint-Esprit. In 2000, the parish municipality changed its status and became the Municipality of Saint-Esprit. Economy Because Saint-Esprit is surrounded by extensive plains, the local economy is characterized by agriculture. The main agricultural activities include tobacco and Sugar Maple cultivation, milk production, and breeding of lamb, pork and poultry. Saint-Esprit also has an industrial park along Highway 25.

The first of these came from Palin's 29th Indian Brigade. The War Office then decided on 11 June that the division should be 'Indianised', with an establishment of one British and three Indian battalions to each brigade. However, this conversion was not completed until the summer of 1918. The process of assembling the division was drawn out: 233rd Brigade began to assemble at Zeitun on 25 May 1917, but then took over the Rafa defences in Sinai and only joined 75th Division on 18 August. The division officially came into existence on 25 June when 234th Brigade started to assemble at el'Arish. Finding the necessary artillery for the division was a real difficulty. A new CLXXII Field Brigade reached Alexandria from the United Kingdom on 23 July, and was immediately broken up to form the nucleus of two second-line Territorial brigades, CLXXII and XXXVII, taking the numbers of units that had been disbanded in France. The third field brigade came from South Africa in July, and joined 75th Division on 12 September after it had been reorganised and re-equipped with 18-pounder guns. However, due to the shortage of 4.5-inch howitzers it was not until October that the British brigades received their howitzer batteries, and the South African brigade's did not arrive until the following April. Order of battle 75th Division was constituted as follows: Staff * General Officer Commanding: Maj-Gen Sir Philip Palin * General Staff Officer Grade 1: Lt-Col J. Spencer ::Lt-Col S.H.

In the Spring of 1918 the division was involved in the actions at Tell 'Asur (11‚Äì12 March) and Berukin (9‚Äì11 April). Battle of Sharon ::See main Article Battle of Tabsor Following its reorganisation in the summer of 1918, 75th Division joined General Allenby's final offensive (the Battles of Megiddo). At the Battle of Sharon (19 September), 75th Division was given the task of taking Miske and the trench system around the village of Et Tire, held by the Turkish 49th Division. Palin had under his command 'A' Squadron (Duke of Lancaster's Own Yeomanry) of the Composite Corps Cavalry RegimentBecke Pt 4, p. 254. and 2nd Light Armoured Motor Battery, Machine Gun Corps. There was no preliminary bombardment: the advance began at 04:30 in moonlight behind a barrage fired by the field artillery, trench mortars and machine guns onto the enemy front line, while the howitzers and heavy artillery fired on specific targets behind. Once the attackers reached the front line, the 18-pounders laid a creeping barrage in front of them onto the subsequent objectives.Falls, pp. 470‚Äì71. 75th Division had 232nd Bde on the right, while 234th Bde was on the left with two companies of the 5/Somerset Light Infantry from 233rd Bde. The Somerset LI companies were to advance between 234th's left and right battalions to capture an isolated work while the others moved straight ahead. The rest of 233rd Bde was in reserve.Falls, pp. 479‚Äì80. 232nd Brigade swept through the enemy's front line, meeting little opposition. The pack mules carrying the brigade signal equipment were stampeded by the bombardment, so no news got back, but the brigade captured Miske with the aid of the South African Field Artillery, which had moved forward quickly after completing its bombardment programme. Et Tire, surrounded by trenches and cactus edges, was more formidable, and the leading troops were exhausted. The Imperial Service Troops of the 3rd Kashmir Rifles had moved up to Brigade HQ on the initiative of their British liaison officer, and were sent in to reinforce the attack. Simultaneously the divisional GSO1 (Lt-Col Rowan-Hamilton) had been sent up by Palin with the cavalry squadron and armoured cars. With the renewed attack and with armoured cars outflanking the village, the Turks evacuated their positions, leaving behind all the papers of their XXII Corps HQ. 234th Brigade had an easier task. The creeping barrage was so accurate that the leading battalions and the Somerset LI companies were able to follow close behind it and gain their objectives with little opposition. In fact the barrage was too slow, and the enemy was able to get away, the only hard fighting being on the Turkish gun lines, which were taken at bayonet point by the 1/152nd Punjabis. By 17:00, XXI Corps' attack had rolled up the whole Turkish right and allowed the Desert Mounted Corps to sweep forward to complete the envelopment of the Turkish army and begin the pursuit.Becke Pt 4, p. 255. Postwar After the end of the fighting on 19 September, 75th Division and the rest of XXI Corps were left on salvage work and road repair until the Armistice with the Turks was signed on 31 October. Demobilisation began early in 1919, but 75th Division was selected for the Army of Occupation of Palestine. In March 1919 it returned to garrison duty in Egypt, becoming responsible for the Eastern Delta, which was renamed 75th Division Area. Many other units were attached for this work. After July 1919 the disturbances in Egypt began to die down, and units began to disperse to their home countries. On 1 April 1920 the Division Area and remaining troops were handed over to 10th (Irish) Division and 75th Division ceased to exist. The divisional number has never been reactivated.

In 1887 he was appointed the fourth Bishop of Jerusalem,Diocesan web-site a post he held for 27 years. A Sub-Prelate of the Order of St John of Jerusalem, he died on 5 November 1914. He had become a Doctor of Divinity (DD). During his ministry, as an Anglo-Catholic, he found himself unable to convert either Christ Church, Jerusalem (under the LJS) or St Paul's (Jerusalem, under the evangelical Church Missionary Society) into his episcopal church. Therefore, he founded the Jerusalem and the East Mission and purchased land outside of the Old City walls, and raised the funds to build what is today St. George's Cathedral, Jerusalem. To raise funds for his own work he started the Good Friday Offering, still observed in the Episcopal Church of the USA. Unlike his predecessor Samuel Gobat, who had resorted to proselytising among Christians of other, mostly Orthodox denominations, legalised by the Porte by a ferman in 1850 issued under the pressure of the Protestant powers of Britain and Prussia, Blyth preferred missions among Jews and Muslims.However, Ottoman law forbade Muslims to convert and missionaries to evangelise them. Proselytism among Christians had been criticised by proponents of the Anglican High Church faction. Blyth wanted to maintain good relations with the Orthodox churches.Cf.

The height of curvature is the same as the height of contour.  Significance  The buccal and lingual contours of a tooth are important in determining the angle at which food is deflected from a tooth surface. If food is deflected too much, some of the gingiva would not have the right amount of stimulation. On the other hand, if food is deflected too little, some of it would be forced into the space which separates the tooth from the gingiva. Consequences of this could be inflammation of the gingiva or periodontal disease. In young people the buccal and lingual curvatures lie below the gum as the teeth have not fully erupted. However, as tooth eruption progresses, the curvature is easier to see. The shape of the crown of a tooth helps to prevent periodontal disease. It does this by allowing food to be deflected onto the gums at a specific angle so that the gum tissue can be stimulated and cleaned. Each tooth is shaped so that food is directed off the tooth and onto the gums instead. The shape of the tooth is also designed specifically for its function and to allow for its self-cleaning ability. The proximal contact areas formed mesially and distally by the height of contour are important in maintaining tooth position and stability, preventing rotation and drift. Locations of height of curvature For the outer (facial) surfaces of all teeth, the height of curvature is located in the cervical third of the teeth. In the inner (lingual) surfaces of anterior teeth, both upper and lower, the height of curvature is also located in the cervical third of the tooth, on the cingulum. In the posterior teeth, both in upper and lower jaw, the lingual height of contour is found at the middle third of the inner surface of the tooth. The lower second premolar proposes an exception as its height of curvature in inner surface is located in the occlusal third of the inner surface. In addition, the curvature of CEJ is more pronounced on the interproximal aspect than the buccal aspect of tooth. Ttherefore the measurement of CAL becomes compromised on the interproximal aspect. Functions The height of contours have great functions to oral cavity # They allow the food to be deflected allowing proper degree of massage to the gingiva # They prevent the food of being accumulated at the tooth # Holding the gingiva under definite tension #Protection of the gingiva surrounding the tooth #Formation of a contact point between teeth, where the mesial and distal surfaces of adjacent teeth meet The height of contour must be replicated in restorative dental work to serve the functions that a natural contour would provide. Mal-developed height of curvature In case of under-developed curvature, gingival recession may result. In case of overdeveloped curvature, food will accumulate and there will be no massage to the gingiva and chronic inflammation may result.

It is located between the districts of Wolfsburg-Reislingen, Wolfsburg-Vorsfelde, Wolfsburg-Nordstadt and Wolfsburg-Stadtmitte. The Allersee lake, which was created at the end of the 1960s, forms the heart of the park. The Allerpark covers an area of 130 hectares and is home to a multitude of leisure facilities and attractions such as the AOK Stadium, the BadeLand Wolfsburg swimming pool and water park complex, the Eis Arena Wolfsburg ice rink and the Volkswagen Arena, as well as a number of other facilities that can be used for free, for example beach volleyball courts, a skatepark and several playgrounds. The company Wolfsburg AG is responsible for the marketing of the Allerpark. History Work on the Allerpark began in 1969 after the respective decisions were taken by Wolfsburg City Council. The river Aller was diverted in order to create the Allersee lake. The aim of the project was for the Allerpark to not only fulfil a cultural purpose, but also play a symbolic role for the city and the surrounding region. A multitude of clubs and associations have been based by the Aller or Allersee since the 1950s and 1960s, for example Wolfsburg's canoeing, rowing and yacht clubs. In 1975, the city initially had to postpone further work on the Allerpark due to reductions in revenue from taxes paid by Volkswagen. Nevertheless, it was able to open the BadeLand Wolfsburg indoor swimming pool and water park complex just two years later. This was then joined by an ice rink now known as the Eis Arena Wolfsburg. The Allersee was made deeper again in 1987. It is currently 1230 metres long and 270 metres wide and contains nearly one million cubic metres of water. In the 1990s, the service sector in Wolfsburg was relatively weak and there was a large drain on purchasing power into the surrounding region. This motivated the creation of the \\"AutoVision\\" concept, which Volkswagen presented to the city as a gift on the occasion of its 60th anniversary. The concept contained a multitude of measures designed to strengthen the quality of life in and competitiveness of the city of Wolfsburg. One of these measures was the creation of a \\"World of Experience\\" with the Allerpark at its core. Plans were made to establish a number of high-quality leisure facilities in the Allerpark area that would not only make the city of Wolfsburg a more attractive location, but also increase its service sector and create jobs. The company Wolfsburg AG was founded as the body responsible for the implementation of the \\"AutoVision\\" concept. The city of Wolfsburg and Volkswagen each have a 50-percent share in the public- private partnership. Wolfsburg AG has been coordinating the project development of the Allerpark since the end of the 1990s. A start was made with the completion of the Volkswagen Arena, the home stadium of the VfL Wolfsburg football club, in 2002. The BadeLand Wolfsburg was also opened in the same year and replaced the city's former indoor swimming pool and water park, which had burnt down in 1998. The Allerpark was fully modernised and redesigned on the occasion of the German Federal Garden Show in 2004. This involved the creation of new features such as an additional lake and new hilly landscapes, for which the park received the German Landscape Architecture Award in 2005. The fact that the Allerpark constituted a large part of the event area alongside the gardens of Wolfsburg Castle also led to the creation of elements such as new car parks and areas for visitors using private transport. The Eis Arena Wolfsburg was opened in 2006. Over the last few years, a number of facilities that can be used for free have also been developed in the Allerpark, for example routes and circuits for in-line skaters and joggers. A total of 350 new jobs were created in the Allerpark between 2000 and 2010. The park's attractions and facilities attract several millions of visitors every year. The most recent constructions to be added to the Allerpark are the AOK Stadium, which was opened in 2015 and hosts the home matches of the women's and youth teams of the VfL Wolfsburg football club, the VfL Center and the VfL Football World. Facilities A wide variety of different \\"experience- oriented leisure facilities\\" have been created in the Allerpark in recent years. Alongside the AOK Stadium, the BadeLand Wolfsburg, the Eis Arena Wolfsburg and the Volkswagen Arena, the park has also welcomed a multitude of additional facilities developed by private investors. These have increased the range of attractions at the location in terms of both quality and quantity. Examples of the specialist facilities available at the Allerpark include the indoor football hall known as the SoccaFive Arena, the Monkeyman high ropes course and the WakePark water ski centre with the neighbouring BeachClub. The Allerpark is also home to the Strike Bowling and Event Center and a campsite located next to the Allersee lake. Visitors to the Allerpark can choose to visit one of several different restaurants. The Colombian Pavilion, which originally formed part of the Expo 2000 world exposition, was rebuilt by the Allersee to house food & drink facilities. The Allerpark is used as a venue for a variety of events every year, for example the \\"Sch√ºtzen- und Volksfest\\" fair and festival, the \\"Sommerfest im Allerpark\\" summer festival and the \\"Volkstriathlon\\" public triathlon event. In recent years, the Summer Festival in particular has proven to be a very popular event that attracts tens of thousands of visitors. Some of the best-known facilities and attractions in the Allerpark include: AOK Stadium AOK Stadion (2015) The AOK Stadium in the Allerpark was constructed between 2013 and 2015. It is the home stadium of the women's and youth teams of the VfL Wolfsburg football club. The new construction has played a particularly important role in further supporting and promoting women's football. The AOK Stadium is also home to the VfL Football World, an interactive exhibition about the club. It is located directly next to the Volkswagen Arena to the west of the Allersee lake. BadeLand Wolfsburg BadeLand Wolfsburg (2014) The first swimming pool in the Allerpark was opened in 1977 but burnt to the ground in 1999 due to a fault. A new indoor swimming pool and water park was therefore constructed on the same site at a total cost of over 34 million euros. The BadeLand Wolfsburg was opened in 2002. It can hold up to 1700 visitors and covers a total area of 11,000 square metres, 3000 square metres of which contain swimming pools and water areas. The BadeLand Wolfsburg is therefore the largest indoor swimming pool and water park in Northern Germany and is well known both throughout the region and further afield. The BadeLand Wolfsburg is located next to the Eis Arena Wolfsburg to the north of the Allersee lake. Eis Arena Wolfsburg Eis Arena Wolfsburg (2009) The Eis Arena Wolfsburg is an ice rink that is home to teams such as the Grizzlys Wolfsburg ice hockey team, which plays in the top German ice hockey league. The arena was opened in 2006 and is also used as a public ice rink. It also acts as an event venue, for example for the Lower Saxony State Figure Skating Championship in 2014. After constantly making significant losses, the Eis Arena Wolfsburg was sold back to the city of Wolfsburg by the Stadtwerke Wolfsburg public services organization at the end of 2014. Volkswagen Arena Volkswagen Arena (2005) The Volkswagen Arena is the home stadium of the VfL Wolfsburg men's professional football team, which plays in the top German Bundesliga football league. It was opened in autumn 2002 and has a capacity of around 30,000 spectators. Construction work on the stadium took a total of 18 months and resulted in overall costs of 53 million euros. The first football match to take place at the Volkswagen Arena was between VfL Wolfsburg and VfB Stuttgart. One of the aims of the Volkswagen Arena was to strengthen the club's international ambitions, especially with regard to the Champions League. The Volkswagen Arena also offers function rooms for congresses, conferences and private events. Associations The Allersee lake in the Allerpark is home to a multitude of different clubs and associations, for example the \\"Motorbootclub Wolfsburg\\", the \\"Sportfischerverein Wolfsburg\\" fishing club and the city's canoeing, rowing and yacht clubs. In fact, most of the water sports clubs located in the Allerpark have been around for longer than the park itself. The Vorsfelde and Wolfsburg location groups of the German Life-Saving Association (DLRG) are also based in the Allerpark. They play a particularly important role as the groups responsible for providing water rescue services on the Allersee. The fact that a large number of clubs and associations are located in or have relocated to the Allerpark is closely connected to the strategy of the city of Wolfsburg to place a special focus on supporting and promoting local sports clubs.

He produced a hybrid advertising/theater piece called MediaWave, then left for Alaska upon finishing in 1981. He wasn‚Äôt given his diploma due to having failed physical education. Writing career Cohen began traveling to South America in 1984 and began an import company. On a trip to Inner Mongolia in 1992 he began writing a short story about going to Inner Mongolia in the dead of winter, which became Invisible World (Reganbooks, 1998) a novel translated into 6 languages. Much of the book was written in hotel rooms in China and South America, and is about antique textiles, smuggling, and the invisible world of the imagination, memory and the future, a world that often overwhelms the book‚Äôs characters. On the publication of Invisible World, encouraged by two-book contracts in the United States and Germany, Cohen closed his store to devote himself to writing. He spent three years writing The Book of Rumor, a novel set in Juneau, Alaska, about a long-ago mine strike, a homeless Tlingit man, and strange messages that appear in the newspaper attacking the leading citizen of the town. Neither publisher accepted the book. Facing an increasingly dire financial situation, Cohen went to Buenos Aires to research petty criminals and corrupt police, and quickly wrote 17 Stone Angels, (Orion, 2003) about a corrupt police chief in Buenos Aires who is assigned to investigate a murder he committed. Published as The Stone Angels, the book was translated into 9 languages and optioned by Paramount Studios. In 2008, Cohen published The Army of the Republic (St. Martins, 2008), a novel about insurgency set in the United States.https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/reviews/2008-10-15-cohenrev_N.htm?loc=interstitialskiphttp://www.juneauempire.com/stories/082808/art_324179839.shtmlhttp://stuartarchercohen.com/books/army- of-the-republic/ In April 2015, Cohen published his fourth novel This Is How It Really Sounds (St. Martin's Press), a novel about skiing, rock 'n roll, malignant high finance, espionage, and three men who share the same name. http://stuartarchercohen.com/books/this-is-how-it-really-sounds/ Works ;Novels * Invisible World (1998) * 17 Stone Angels (2003) * The Army of the Republic (2008) * This Is How It Really Sounds (2015) References Category:20th-century American novelists Category:Writers from Cincinnati Category:Writers from Alaska Category:People from Juneau, Alaska Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Businesspeople from Cincinnati Category:Johns Hopkins University alumni Category:Columbia University alumni Category:21st-century American novelists Category:American male novelists Category:20th-century American male writers Category:21st-century American male writers Category:Novelists from Ohio ","title":"Stuart Archer Cohen"},{"id":"24505143","text":"CCU is a Chilean producer of diversified beverages founded in 1902.

It was entered into the 1998 Cannes Film Festival. Plot Claire doesn't enjoy the profession at all, but owes her pimp money and must continue to work. She goes to neighboring Newark, New Jersey, where she has a cousin. She takes a job in a salon and forms a relationship with her cousin and Siobhan. Before long, she begins to receive suspicious phone calls; at work, she is called to the phone and when she answers there is no one on the line. At home in the middle of the night she receives another call. After hanging up, the phone rings again. She feels unsafe, that perhaps Roland has found her, and so she leaves her apartment and walks to a nearby bar. As soon as she walks in, she sits down at a man's table, asking if he is waiting for someone. When he says no, she asks him to dance with her. Claire and Elton dance for a few hours and we next see her waking up in his bed the next morning. It is apparent that she picked up someone to take her home with them, for a safe place to spend the night. When she arrives home, she feels something is out of place. He watches her speak to someone (Roland), then follows her to a hotel where she stays for quite some time, then gives up waiting. At Dolan's apartment, there is a knock on her door. Elton confronts her about who she really is, where she lives, and asks if she has a pimp and if she owes him any money. Over the next few days/weeks, they go to work and meet afterward. Elton has feelings for her, and the two exchange I-love-you's. Elton goes to see Roland, who has been expecting him. Roland grabs the other man by the throat and tells him Claire always was and always will be a whore and that he should get out while he can. It is implied she may be his own daughter. He also speaks with an Eastern European prostitute in a hotel room, but seems uninterested in having sex with her, and asks her some questions. He returns to the city. Claire has gone to the doctor and checks out okay. She continues to see a few clients, but during one visit, she thinks she sees Elton's reflection on the balcony outside and goes to the window, cracking it to look out. Her client comes into the room and has her leave it open for the air, and they carry on, with Elton on the balcony. Now having enough money to pay off her debt, she goes to pay off Roland. He asks her if she is going to keep her baby, then congratulates her, offering her a packet of money \\"for the baby\\" but she refuses. He insists, but she continues to refuse his money as it would be something Roland could hold over her in the future. She goes home, packs a suitcase with an air of finality, and goes to the airport. Elton is walking down the street with a blond woman when Roland passes by and stops him to say hello. Elton introduces the woman as his wife, and she and Roland talk for a moment. She is seven months pregnant with a girl.

A patent for the lighthouse was subsequently obtained in 1824. The builder was William Trench, who lost his son off the rocks and died in debt in 1725. He is said to have originally been allowed a pension from the Post Office, rather than payment from shipping tolls. An act of 1730 allowed his son-in-law, Sutton Morgan, to increase the dues charged for shipping and confirmed the patent on the light to Morgan's heirs forever. History It was rebuilt around 1759 by Morgan's heirs for about ¬£3,000. The rebuilt lighthouse was a slightly tapering limestone tower, in diameter and about high. It was lit by a coal brazier on top of the tower. Morgan Jones, who was twice High Sheriff of Cardiganshire, inherited the lighthouse in 1778; he raised the top of the tower by and built an iron balcony with railings enclosing the oil-burning lantern. The lantern was glazed all around with square panes and covered by a cupola. Trinity House took over operation of the lighthouse under an enabling act of 1836, but not without a fight from the original owners, who wanted to protect their investment from a low takeover price. The final price paid was a little over ¬£440,000 (four hundred and forty thousand pounds Sterling) a reflection of the huge revenues that were accruing to the owners via shipping dues of 1p (one penny) per ton from every commercial vessel over 5 tons entering Liverpool. Foreign ships and ships sailing in from foreign ports were liable to double this rate. The dues were payable irrespective of whether or not the vessel actually passed within the range of the light or the time of passing. The lighthouse was lavishly restored by James Walker, exhibiting two of his characteristics: a decrease in diameter and a solid parapet (as seen at his Trwyn Du Lighthouse). The stone-built gallery was wide and bracketed out on corbels with a crenellated parapet. A new cast-iron lantern, in diameter, was glazed with square panes around a dioptric light with mirrors, later replaced by a lens. On the north side of the tower there is a former external doorway exhibiting the Trinity House coat of arms, which now leads to the engine room. The light shines at a height of above the average high tide, with an intensity of 1,150,000 candelas. It flashes twice every 10 seconds and can be seen away. In 1903‚Äì4, a solid circular tower, about in diameter, was added to the south- west side of the main tower to carry a sector light. This shines at an elevation of above the sea. The light was automated in 1987 and is now controlled from Holyhead. Nearby are castellated dwellings having cobbled yards and entrance stairs, along with symmetrically sited privies, a garden, a stone bridge connecting two islets, and a unique stone well-head building. An axial corridor leads from the dwellings to the lighthouse tower's base. The early date of the lighthouse keepers‚Äô cottages makes the buildings of considerable interest. For a number of summers, they have been used by wardens working for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.

She was the Princess of Carignan by marriage and mother of the princesse de Lamballe and of Victor Amadeus II, Prince of Carignan. Biography Christine Henriette was born in Rotenburg the youngest of the ten children of the Landgrave Ernst Leopold I of Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg and his consort Princess Eleonore Anna Maria von L√∂wenstein-Wertheim-Rochefort. Her older sister Polyxena was married in 1730 to the future Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia and had issue. Another sister, Caroline was the wife of the French Prime Minister, Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon until her death in 1741. After Polyxena's marriage, Christine became engaged to Louis Victor, Prince of Carignan, the eldest surviving child of Victor Amadeus, Prince of Carignan and his wife Maria Vittoria Francesca of Savoy.She was the legitimised daughter of King Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia and his mistress Jeanne Baptiste d'Albert de Luynes The Carignans were a cadet branch of the House of Savoy, would inherit from them the kingship of Sardinia, and would be declared kings of Italy from 1861. Christine married Louis Victor on 4 May 1740 at the age of 22. The next year her husband succeeded to the title Prince de Carignan, the seigneury of Carignan having belonged to the Savoys since 1418.

Christine's second child, born at the Palazzo Carignano, was named Victor Amadeus and was the great-grandfather of the future Victor Emmanuel II of Italy. Her fifth daughter was her most famous; Louise, princesse de Lamballe, the tragic best friend of Marie Antoinette. Christine died at the Palazzo Carignano in Turin on the night of 31 August ‚Äì 1 September 1778, and was followed less than three months later by her husband. Buried firstly at Turin Cathedral, she was moved in 1835 to Turin's Basilica of Superga. At her death the Gazette de France published a small epitaph for her in honour of her daughter Madame de Lamballe: > Tuesday, the 31st of last month, princesse Christine Henriette de Hesse > Rheinfels, wife of Louis Victor Am√©d√©e de Savoie, Prince de Carignan, died > in this city [Turin], after a lingering and painful illness.

They could trace their origins to 1776, when they were raised as the 14th Carnatic Battalion. The regiment first saw action during the Carnatic Wars. This was followed by the Battle of Sholinghur in the Second Anglo-Mysore War and the Battle of Mahidpur in the Third Anglo-Mysore War. Their next active service was in China for the First and Second Opium Wars. In 1885 they took part in the Third Burmese War. In 1914 the class composition of the 74th Punjabis consisted of 4 companies of Punjabi Muslims, 2 of Sikhs and 2 of Punjabi Hindus. This diversity was in accordance with the enlistment system of the period; under which about three-quarters of the Indian regiments were each recruited from more than one religious or racial groups. The 74th Punjabis had historically been a Madrasi regiment (see below) but as part of a general policy the area of recruitment had changed to the Punjab after 1889. During World War I the regiment was part of the 8th Lucknow Division which initially remained in India on internal security and training duties. They were posted to the 10th (Irish) Division in 1918, and took part in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. After World War I the Indian government reformed the army moving from single battalion regiments to multi battalion regiments.Sumner p.15 In 1922, the 74th Punjabis became the 4th Battalion, 2nd Punjab Regiment.Sharma, p.24 This new regiment was disbanded in 1947.

The central legal provision explaining what this means, i.e. the central legal provision relating to the novelty under the EPC, is . Namely, \\"an invention can be patented only if it is new. An invention is considered to be new if it does not form part of the state of the art. The purpose of is to prevent the state of the art being patented again.\\"EPO Board of Appeal Case Law, Special edition 2, Official Journal 2009, p. 18. See also decision T 12/81 of February 9, 1982, reasons 5: \\"(...) The purpose of Article 54(1) EPC is to prevent the state of the art being patented again.\\"  Definition of the \\"state of the art\\"  Since an invention is considered to be new if it does not form part of the state of the art, the legal concept of \\"state of the art\\" is critical for assessing whether an invention is new. State of the art under Article 54(2) EPC The state of the art is essentially defined in . Namely: > The state of the art shall be held to comprise everything made available to > the public by means of a written or oral description, by use, or in any > other way, before the date of filing of the European patent application. The state of the art under the EPC is therefore said to be absolute. Even the disclosure to a single person who is under no obligation to maintain secrecy is sufficient for a disclosure to be considered part of the state of the art. The absolute novelty also means that even the theoretical possibility of having unrestricted access to a certain information is regarded as rendering this information available to the public. (with reference to decisions T 1081/01, T 482/89, and T 381/87). In other words, as summarized in decision T 1081/01: > The case law (...) accepts that information is \\"available to the public\\" if > only a single member of the public is in a position to gain access to it and > understand it, and if there is no obligation to maintain secrecy.Decision T > 1081/01 of September 27, 2004, reasons 5. State of the art under Article 54(3) EPC Furthermore, extends the content of the state of the art by also including \\"the content of European patent applications as filed, the dates of filing of which are prior to the date referred to in paragraph 2 and which were published on or after that date\\". The purpose of this notional extension of the state of the art under the European Patent Convention is to address conflicting prior rights which might otherwise, without Article 54(3) EPC, lead to more than one patent granted for the same invention to different inventors. The extension of the definition of the state of the art under Article 54(3) EPC is limited to the assessment of novelty and does not apply to the assessment of inventive step. In other words, \\"documents within the meaning of Article 54(3) EPC are not to be considered in deciding on inventive step\\". Non-prejudicial disclosures (Article 55 EPC) provides for two specific situations in which a disclosure before the filing of a European patent application might not be regarded as part of the state of the art under Article 54 EPC. The first situation is the case of an evident abuse \\"in relation to the applicant or his legal predecessor\\", and the second is the disclosure of an invention \\"at an official, or officially recognised, international exhibition falling within the terms of the Convention on international exhibitions signed at Paris on 22 November 1928 and last revised on 30 November 1972.\\"  Novelty assessment = Explicit or implicit disclosure  When it comes to assessing novelty, the disclosure of a prior art document is regarded as encompassing not only its explicit disclosure but also \\"everything that the skilled person would inherently understand when reading the document\\",T 1995/15, reasons 1.1.4 i.e. its implicit disclosure.: \\"Taking implicit features into account\\". \\"The implicit disclosure [of a piece of prior art] means no more than the clear and unambiguous consequence of what is explicitly mentioned\\" in the piece of prior art.Decision T 1523/07 of 24.11.2009, Reasons 2.4.  Specific disclosure taking away the novelty of a generic feature  When assessing novelty, a generic disclosure (in the state of the art, i.e. for instance in a prior art document) does not normally take away the novelty of any specific example falling within that disclosure.: \\"Generic disclosure\\".\\"In T 651/91 the board cited with approval the Guidelines, confirming that a generic disclosure did not normally deprive any specific example falling within that disclosure of novelty.\\" in : \\"The boards' application of the Guidelines in specific cases\\" On the other hand, \\"a specific disclosure does take away the novelty of a generic claim embracing that disclosure\\".: \\"Generic disclosure and specific examples\\"T 651/91 (in German) point 4.3: \\"In √úbereinstimmung mit den Pr√ºfungsrichtlinien (...) ist dazu festzustellen, da√ü die Offenbarung einer allgemeinen Lehre die Neuheit einer speziellen Ausf√ºhrung, die unter diese allgemeine Lehre f√§llt, nicht vorwegnimmt. Allgemein kann eine Lehre selbst dann sein, wenn sie die Auswahl zwischen lediglich zwei Alternativen offenl√§√üt.\\"; T 776/07, point 2.2, third paragraph: \\"It is established case law that a specific disclosure takes away novelty of a generic feature in a claim but that a generic disclosure does not take away novelty of a specific feature\\". For instance, the prior disclosure of the subset \\"vegetables\\" takes away the novelty of the wider set \\"fruits and plants\\". Or, as two other examples, :\\"a disclosure of copper takes away the novelty of metal as a generic concept, but not the novelty of any metal other than copper, and one of rivets takes away the novelty of fastening means as a generic concept, but not the novelty of any fastening other than rivets.\\" More generally, any disclosure in the prior art of something falling within the ambit of a claim deprives the claim of novelty.  Legal fiction of Article 54(4) and (5) EPC  Besides the general principle that something cannot be patented if it was already known in the state of the art (because not new), there are cases wherein a substance or composition may be notionally considered new (i.e. by virtue of a legal fiction) even when the substance or composition is as such already comprised in the state of the art. Namely, Article 54(4) and (5) EPC \\"acknowledges the notional novelty of substances or compositions even when they are as such already comprised in the state of the art, provided they are claimed for a new use in a method which excludes as such from patent protection.\\"Decision G 2/08 of the Enlarged Board of Appeal dated 19 February 2010, Reasons 5.10.9. Article 53(c) EPC excludes from patentability methods for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy and diagnostic methods practised on the human or animal body, but this provision does not apply to products, in particular substances or compositions, for use in any of these methods. Article 54(4) and (5) EPC is complementary to Article 53(c) EPC.

Nickelodeon is one of two ViacomCBS-branded networks owned by Corus; CMT is jointly owned by the two companies. History In September 2008, Corus Entertainment was given approval by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to launch a specialty channel named \\"YTV OneWorld\\", described as \\" a national, English-language Category 2 specialty service that would offer programming from around the world targeting children aged 6 to 17 and their families.

It was later launched on June 25, 2013 for Rogers Cable and added to Bell Fibe TV's service on October 25, 2013. On September 22, 2015, Corus Entertainment announced the launch of Nickelodeon GO, an app that allows viewers to watch the channel live, as well as stream shows from its American counterpart. The app is currently available for iOS and Android platforms, but requires a subscription to Nickelodeon from a pay-TV provider.\\"Corus Launches YTV, Nick Apps\\", Animation Magazine, September 22, 2015 In June 2019, as part of the launch of Amazon Prime Video Channels in Canada, Corus launched a standalone Subscription video on demand channel for Nickelodeon (later renamed Nick+ in December of that year).

The channel airs a mixture of both contemporary and older series, while also carrying a commercial-free, Nick Jr.-branded block of preschool programming during the daytime hours.

The canal is long and runs between Wolfsburg and Gifhorn. It was built to protect agricultural land from flooding by the river Aller. The nearly straight canal carries water from the Aller more quickly than the river itself can in its meandering course through this section of the old glacial valley. Route The Aller Canal was completed in 1863 after a three-year construction period. It begins near Weyhausen just beyond the city of Wolfsburg, where it is joined by the tributary of the Kleine Aller. Here the Aller divides itself between its natural river channel and the canal. The canal runs in an almost straight line through the wetland of the Barnbruch as far as Gifhorn where it passes the town to the south. West of Gifhorn the canal uses the upgraded and widened stream bed of the Hehlenriede and, 5 km west of Gifhorn, near Brenneckenbr√ºck on the B 188, it rejoins the Aller. About a kilometre before that the water of the canal drops by about a metre over a weir. The river flows parallel and north of the canal by several kilometres and, in this flat area of the Aller's old glacial valley, forms tightly-spaced meanders which reduce the water velocity in the river. Construction Monument to the construction of the canal The Aller Canal in the Barnbruch wetland The construction of the Aller Canal between 1860 and 1863 stemmed from a state treaty between Prussia, the Kingdom of Hanover and Duchy of Brunswick for the regulation of the Aller. Its purpose was to control the spring floods in the Aller valley and to assist in draining the former swampland of the Barnbruch. The canal is only about 5 m wide and 1 m deep. To appreciate the feat achieved by its builders it should be borne in mind that, at the time, there was almost no technical equipment and workers had to excavate the channel by hand using shovels. A monument to the construction was erected by the canal between Brenneckenbr√ºck and Gifhorn- Winkel. It carries the following inscription: :Allerkanal, erbaut 1860-63, Kostenaufwand 45.000 Thaler, den Bauern der Allerd√∂rfer von Wolfsburg bis Diekhorst, die ihn schufen, dem Wasserbauinspektor August Hess in Celle, der ihn baute und den M√§nnern, die ihn betreuten zum Gedenken ...which means: \\"To commemorate the Aller Canal, built 1860-63 at a cost of 45,000 thalers, and the farmers of the Aller villages from Wolfsburg to Diekhorst who created it, hydraulic engineer, August Hess, in Celle, who designed it, and the men he oversaw.\\" Water quality The Lower Saxon water quality reportGew√§sserg√ºtebericht Aller / Quelle 2004 des Nieders√§chsischen Landesbetriebs f√ºr Wasserwirtschaft, K√ºsten- und Naturschutz of 2004 assessed the chemical water contamination of the Aller Canal along with the river Aller itself as moderately polluted (water quality class II). Because the fascines that secured the banks have largely rotted away, the canal has become a near- natural waterway. The canal runs through the deciduous woods of the Barnbruch, which provides shade. This prevents the growth of weeds in the river bed, unlike the river Aller which is unshaded in most places.

Polish-Lithuanian forces led by Stephen B√°thory (Batory), King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, successfully fought against the army of Ivan IV \\"the Terrible\\", Tsar of Russia, over the Duchy of Livonia and Polotsk. Russian forces were expelled from Livonia before the campaign was concluded by the Truce of Jam Zapolski. Background In the second half of the 16th century, several powers, including Poland, Lithuania, and Russia were engaged in the struggle over the control of the ports in the southern Baltic Sea (Dominium Maris Baltici). The Russo-Lithuanian War of 1558‚Äì1570, in which Poland aided Lithuania (and in 1569 united with it forming the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), ended inconclusively with a three-year- long truce. The death of Polish king Sigismund II Augustus created a brief period in which Tsar Ivan IV of Russia contemplated taking part in the Polish royal election (see Polish-Lithuanian-Muscovite Commonwealth), but eventually the Commonwealth elected Stephen B√°thory of Poland to its throne, and the hostilities between Russia and the Commonwealth resumed. Inflancka wojna, Encyklopedia WIEM 1575‚Äì1577 In 1575 Ivan ordered another attack on Poland, and succeeded in taking parts of Livonia (notably, Salacgrƒ´va and P√§rnu). In 1577 Russian forces besieged Reval (Revel, Tallinn) and a strong army was concentrating near Pskov. At the same time Polish forces were tied down on the western side of the Baltic Sea, dealing with the Danzig rebellion. In July the main Muscovite army of about 30,000 advanced from Pskov, taking Viƒºaka, Rƒìzekne, Daugavpils, Koknese, Gulbene, and surrounding areas.Dariusz Kupisz, Psk√≥w 1581‚Äì1582, Warszawa, 2006 A Polish counter-offensive‚Äîknown as the First Campaign of Bathory‚Äîbegun in the fall, and succeeded in taking back some of the territories.left 1578 Negotiations took part in that year, and a three-year truce was signed, although it was rejected by King Bathory who was preparing for a larger counteroffensive. At the same time, Polish and Swedish forces managed to stop further progress of the Muscovite forces in the Battles of Wenden (1577‚Äì1578). 1579‚Äì1580 250x250px  Prelude  A large army was gathered prior to the campaign. In preparation to the campaign, some 7,311 cavalry and 6,519 infantry mercenaries were hired in the Kingdom of Poland, while the Grand Duchy of Lithuania hired 1,445 cavalry and 2,530 infantry mercenaries. The mercenaries were assembled into units according to their ethnicities (Hungarian, German, and Polish). The Hungarian mercenaries stayed on after the campaign, forming the Hajduk units. Combined with levies among the aristocrats, a force of 41,914 soldiers was assembled (22,975 from Lithuania and 18,739 from Poland). The majority of this force, 71%, were cavalry and mercenaries made up some 41% of the army. Peasant levy pioneer regiments, in addition to Russian streltsy and Ukrainian Cossack bands, were in the army. Bathory's army consisted of Polish, Lithuanian, Hungarian, Wallachian, Bohemian, and German soldiers, besides the Szekler brigade under M√≥zes Sz√©kely.E. Liptai: Magyarorsz√°g hadt√∂rt√©nete (1), Zr√≠nyi Katonai Kiad√≥ 1984. left  Campaign  Bathory was the supreme commander of the main army (over 40,000 strong), however, he appointed commanders to lead different parts of it: * Lithuanian nobility was led by Mikalojus Radvila Rudasis, * Lithuanian-hired mercenaries were commanded by Kristupas Radvila Perk≈´nas, * German mercenaries were under the command of Krzysztof Rozdra≈ºewski, * Hungarian mercenaries were led by G√°sp√°r Bekes, * The Royal Household Guard was led by Janusz Zbaraski, * The rest were placed under command of Mikolaj Mielecki. The Lithuanian soldiers were reluctant to follow any orders given by Polish commanders and set up their own military camps apart from the Poles, took military decisions autonomously, in addition to many other actions, sometimes to the detriment of the war effort. In other words, the army did not have a centralised command system. During the fighting known as the Second Campaign of Bathory, the army advanced on Polotsk. The siege began 11 August, and the city surrendered on the 29th of that month.Dariusz Kupisz, Po≈Çock 1579, Warszawa, 2003 The Polish-Lithuanian army also captured all 8 Russian- occupied castles in Polotsk - Rasony region (Sokol, Nescherda, Susha, Krasnae, Turovlia, Sitna, Kaz'jany, Usviaty) . Lithuanian-Polish forces resumed their offensive the following year with the Third Campaign of Bathory, besieging Velikiye Luki on 29 August and taking it on 5 September. A cavalry battle took place on 20 September near Toropets and ended in another victory for the Commonwealth. The joint forces also captured Velizh and Nevel.Siege of Pskov, the last (and unfinished) painting of left ...and the siege from Polish perspective, \\"Bathory at Pskov\\" by Jan Matejko. 1581‚Äì1582 The last phase of the war centered around the siege of Pskov by the Polish forces. Batory did not succeed in taking the town, but the Russians, facing growing threat from Sweden (who took Narva in the battle of Narva (1581), decided to sign a truce treaty favorable to Poland.Charles Arnold-Baker, The companion to British history, Routledge, 2001, , Google Print, p.95 Truce of Jam Zapolski The truce, signed in 1582 for 10 years, was favorable to Poland, which regained Duchy of Livonia, kept Velizh and Polotsk.

His subjects were drawn from Jewish folklore, from Greek mythology, the Bible, and also from Fran√ßois Rabelais. Reder is quoted as having said, \\"We were born already drunk with fantasy\\", referring to his early life in Bukovina. The son of a Jewish innkeeper, at 17 he was conscripted into the Austrian army and spent World War I in the trenches. He went on to study at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. While working on his sculptures in his spare time, he supported himself by carving cemetery monuments. He moved to Prague in 1930 because of anti-Semitic demonstrations. In 1935 Reder had his first solo exhibition at the gallery of Manes, an association of artists in Prague. This exhibition created a sensation and was widely published by newspapers in Prague, Paris, Wienna and Basel. Most sculptures were sold.John I.H. Baur: Bernard Reder, 1961, kat. Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, p. 112 Two years later, in 1937, he moved to Paris and became a good friend of the sculptor and painter Aristide Maillol. In 1940 he exhibited at the Wildenstein Gallery in Paris. Later that year, Reder was forced to flee Paris to escape from the Nazis, and Maillol secured a passage for him and his wife to travel to Spain, where he was imprisoned for illegal entry. On his release, they travelled to Havana, Cuba, where Reder influenced many artists. All the works in his Paris studio were later destroyed by the Germans. Reder arrived in New York City in 1943, but in 1945 he became partially paralysed by a serious illness, and concentrated more on woodcuts and drawings. He became an American citizen in 1948. Rader exhibited at the 3rd Sculpture International held in Philadelphia in 1949 and is one of the sculptors in the 70 Sculptors photograph taken there. He was shown regularly at the Whitney Museum and was shown at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1949. In 1954, Reder went to Italy to sculpt in Rome and Florence. In 1956, he was given a one-man exhibition at The Galleria d'Arte Moderno L'Indiano, Florence, which received much attention and acclaim from art historian John Rewald. In 1961 he was given a solo one-man retrospective exhibition show at the Whitney Museum and for the first time in its history the museum devoted three of its floors to a single artist. Bernard Reder died in 1963 in New York. His last four years were very productive, producing over thirty-five bronze sculptures.

Cannabis, now locally grown in most states of the federation, was introduced to the country by foreigners. Ms Dagmar Thomas, the Country Representative of United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), says Nigeria was one of the largest cannabis growers in Africa, with over 8% of the population using cannabis. Annual cannabis seizures increased from 126 metric tonnes in 2005 to 210 metric tonnes in 2007. The NDLEA describes the South West region of Nigeria as one of the main centers of illicit drug production in the country. of cannabis farmland was discovered and destroyed in the region in 2008. In particular, Edo State has the highest rate of seizure of cannabis in the country. In April 2009, the NDLEA confiscated 6.5 tonnes of marijuana from the home of a man in Ogun State who claimed to be 114 years old. In September 2009 the NDLEA reported destroying a 24 hectare Cannabis Plantation in a forest reserve in Osun State. In January 2009, the NDLEA publicly burned 5,605.45 kilograms of drugs seized from traffickers in the historic town of Badagry, Lagos. The bonfire included 376.45 kilograms of cocaine, 71.46 kilograms of heroin and 5,157.56 tonnes of cannabis. in 2015 Drug trafficking The United States has donated full body scanning machines for the Lagos, Kano, Abuja and Port Harcourt international airports and has provided security training and orientation airport officers. The machines have proved effective in catching smugglers and couriers taking cocaine from Latin America to Europe by way of Nigeria. Between 2006 and June 2008 over 12,663 suspected drug dealers were arrested, with seizure of over 418.8 metric tonnes of various hard drugs. For example, in July 2009 a woman about to board a KLM flight at the Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport was arrested by NDLEA officers and later excreted 42 wraps of cocaine, weighing 585 grams. In September 2009, the NDLEA arrested a Guinean woman en route from Brazil to Europe with 6.350 kg of pure cocaine at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport in Lagos. In 2008 Nigeria was certified by the United States of America in the anti-narcotic crusade, for the eight successive time. President George Bush said that Nigeria had made significant progress in counter narcotics and had effectively co-operated with the United States on drug- related and money laundering cases. In Katsina State alone, one hundred people were convicted for drug offences from January to May 2008, and 358 people were arrested for drug offences in this period. Drug Barons Speaking of efforts to go after the organizers of the trade, Ahmadu Giade, chairman/chief executive officer of NDLEA in 2008 said the agency had seized N270 million worth of shares from drug barons, as well as cars, houses and other property worth hundreds of millions of Naira. After a September 2009 meeting with the head of the Nigerian Immigration Service to discuss exchange of biometric data of convicted drug barons and traffickers, Giade said cooperation between the agencies would help deny passports to convicted drug barons. Controversy The U.S. Department of State notes that there have been credible allegations of drug-related corruption at NDLEA. In late November 2005 NDLEA Chairman Bello Lafiaji was dismissed by President Olusegun Obasanjo due to allegations of corruption and replaced by Ahmadu Giade, a retired deputy commissioner of police. Bello Lafiaji‚Äôs continued vow and dedication to make life unbearable for drug merchants and strike them where it hurts the most made him a target of the drug baron as was evidenced in their connivance with some third party to frame him up in 2005.I Was Asked to Lie About Euros ‚Äì Ex-NDLEA Employee: http://allafrica.com/stories/200911050171.html Bello Lafiaji was wrongly convicted on June 21, 2010 of conspiracy and conversion of 164,300 euros seized from a drug suspect in November 2005 when he was the Chairman of the NDLEA.

Early history Sam and Louise Perrella opened their first cafe in Keewatin, Minnesota after Sam was laid off from the local iron mines. Sam had heard war veterans talk of pizza and he visited a friend in Chicago to learn how to make pizza. After much experimentation and recipe development, some new equipment was purchased and the cafe was moved into a larger space at 107 East Howard in Hibbing, MN. Originally called \\"La Pizzeria,\\" Sam and Louise officially opened as a pizza restaurant on October 2, 1954. Expansion and growth The original store had almost immediate success, so Sam decided to support relatives and friends who wanted to get into the business. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Sam helped establish over 20 stores in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and North Dakota and eventually sold his interest in most of the stores to his partners. After Sam's death in 1975, his sons Jeff and Greg expanded the original store and moved to a larger location across the street. Greg left the business in 1989, and Jeff retired in 2002. Some locations have been sold or closed over the years. There are currently 17 affiliated Sammy's or Sammy Perrella's locations. Sammy Perrella's Two of Sam Perrella's grandsons opened the first store in the Twin Cities region of Minnesota in 2004. They trademarked Sammy Perrella's in order to protect the brand name in the new major market and in any foreseeable future markets. It was determined that the \\"Sammy's Pizza\\" name had been used by dozens of unrelated restaurants in other world and U.S. markets. They had exclusive rights to the \\"Sammy's Pizza\\" name in the region but it could not be registered as a unique trademark.

In the face of much discouragement from other polar explorers, Nansen took his ship Fram to the New Siberian Islands in the eastern Arctic Ocean, froze her into the pack ice, and waited for the drift to carry her towards the pole. Impatient with the slow speed and erratic character of the drift, after 18 months Nansen and a chosen companion, Hjalmar Johansen, left the ship with a team of dogs and sledges and made for the pole. They did not reach it, but they achieved a record Farthest North latitude of 86¬∞13.6‚Ä≤N before a long retreat over ice and water to reach safety in Franz Josef Land. Meanwhile, Fram continued to drift westward, finally emerging in the North Atlantic Ocean. The idea for the expedition had arisen after items from the American vessel Jeannette, which had sunk off the north coast of Siberia in 1881, were discovered three years later off the south-west coast of Greenland. The wreckage had obviously been carried across the polar ocean, perhaps across the pole itself. Based on this and other debris recovered from the Greenland coast, the meteorologist Henrik Mohn developed a theory of transpolar drift, which led Nansen to believe that a specially designed ship could be frozen in the pack ice and follow the same track as Jeannette wreckage, thus reaching the vicinity of the pole. Nansen supervised the construction of a vessel with a rounded hull and other features designed to withstand prolonged pressure from ice. The ship was rarely threatened during her long imprisonment, and emerged unscathed after three years. The scientific observations carried out during this period contributed significantly to the new discipline of oceanography, which subsequently became the main focus of Nansen's scientific work. Fram's drift and Nansen's sledge journey proved conclusively that there were no significant land masses between the Eurasian continents and the North Pole, and confirmed the general character of the north polar region as a deep, ice-covered sea. Although Nansen retired from exploration after this expedition, the methods of travel and survival he developed with Johansen influenced all the polar expeditions, north and south, which followed in the subsequent three decades.  Background  Fridtjof Nansen at the time of his Greenland crossing In September 1879, Jeannette, an ex-Royal Navy gunboat converted by the US Navy for Arctic exploration, and commanded by George W. De Long, entered the pack ice north of the Bering Strait. She remained ice-bound for nearly two years, drifting to the area of the New Siberian Islands, before being crushed and sunk on 13 June 1881. Her crew escaped in boats and made for the Siberian coast; most, including De Long, subsequently perished either during the boat journey or in the wastelands of the Lena River delta. Three years later, relics from Jeannette appeared on the opposite side of the world, in the vicinity of Julianehaab on the southwest coast of Greenland. These items, frozen into the drifting ice, included clothing bearing crew members' names and documents signed by De Long; they were indisputably genuine. In a lecture given in 1884 to the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters Dr. Henrik Mohn, one of the founders of modern meteorology, argued that the finding of the Jeannette relics indicated the existence of an ocean current flowing from east to west across the entire Arctic Ocean. The Danish governor of Julianehaab, writing of the find, surmised that an expedition frozen into the Siberian sea might, if its ship were to prove strong enough, cross the polar ocean and land in South Greenland. These theories were read with interest by the 23-year-old Fridtjof Nansen, then working as a curator at the Bergen Museum while completing his doctoral studies. Nansen was already captivated by the frozen north; two years earlier he had experienced a four-month voyage on the sealer Viking, which had included three weeks trapped in drifting ice. An expert skier, Nansen was making plans to lead the first crossing of the Greenland icecap, an objective delayed by the demands of his academic studies, but triumphantly achieved in 1888‚Äì89. Through these years Nansen remembered the east‚Äìwest Arctic drift theory and its inherent possibilities for further polar exploration, and shortly after his return from Greenland he was ready to announce his plans.  Preparations = Plan  alt=Portion of the globe centred on the North Pole, showing the continental masses of Eurasia and America, also Greenland, The Arctic Ocean, showing a theoretical course of a drift from the New Siberian Islands to the Atlantic Ocean In February 1890 Nansen addressed a meeting of the Norwegian Geographical Society in Oslo (then called Christiania). After drawing attention to the failures of the many expeditions which had approached the North Pole from the west, he considered the implications of the discovery of the Jeannette items, along with further finds of driftwood and other debris from Siberia or Alaska that had been identified along the Greenland coast. \\"Putting all this together,\\" Nansen said, \\"we are driven to the conclusion that a current flows ... from the Siberian Arctic Sea to the east coast of Greenland,\\" probably passing across the Pole. It seemed that the obvious thing to do was \\"to make our way into the current on that side of the Pole where it flows northward, and by its help to penetrate into those regions which all who have hitherto worked against [the current] have sought in vain to reach.\\" Nansen's plan required a small, strong and manoeuvrable ship, powered by sail and an engine, capable of carrying fuel and provisions for twelve men for five years. The vessel would follow Jeannette's route to the New Siberian Islands, and in the approximate position of Jeannette's sinking, when ice conditions were right \\"we shall plough our way in amongst the ice as far as we can.\\" The ship would then drift with the ice towards the pole and eventually reach the sea between Greenland and Spitsbergen. Should the ship founder, a possibility which Nansen thought very unlikely, the party would camp on a floe and allow itself to be carried towards safety. Nansen observed: \\"If the Jeannette Expedition had had sufficient provisions, and had remained on the ice-floe on which the relics were found, the result would doubtless have been very different from what it was.\\" When Nansen's plans became public knowledge The New York Times was enthusiastic, deeming it \\"highly probable that there is a comparatively short and direct route across the Arctic Ocean by way of the North Pole, and that nature herself has supplied a means of communication across it.\\" However, most experienced polar hands were dismissive. The American explorer Adolphus Greely called it \\"an illogical scheme of self-destruction\\"; his assistant, Lieutenant David Brainerd, called it \\"one of the most ill-advised schemes ever embarked on\\", and predicted that it would end in disaster. Sir Allen Young, a veteran of the searches for Sir John Franklin's lost expedition, did not believe that a ship could be built to withstand the crushing pressure of the ice: \\"If there is no swell the ice must go through her, whatever material she is made of.\\" Sir Joseph Hooker, who had sailed south with James Clark Ross in 1839‚Äì43, was of the same opinion, and thought the risks were not worth taking. However, the equally experienced Sir Leopold McClintock called Nansen's project \\"the most adventurous programme ever brought under the notice of the Royal Geographical Society\\". The Swedish philanthropist Oscar Dickson, who had financed Baron Nordenski√∂ld's conquest of the North-East Passage in 1878‚Äì79, was sufficiently impressed to offer to meet Nansen's costs. With Norwegian nationalism on the rise, however, this gesture from their union partner Sweden provoked hostility in the Norwegian press; Nansen decided to rely solely on Norwegian support, and declined Dickson's proposal.  Finance  Nansen's original estimate for the total cost of the expedition was . After giving a passionate speech before the Parliament of Norway (Storting), Nansen was awarded a grant of NOK 200,000; the balance was raised from private contributions which included 20,000 kroner from King Oscar II of Norway and Sweden. The Royal Geographical Society in London gave ¬£300 (about NOK 6,000). Unfortunately, Nansen had underestimated the financing required‚Äîthe ship alone would cost more than the total at his disposal. A renewed plea to the Storting produced a further NOK 80,000, and a national appeal raised the grand total to NOK 445,000. According to Nansen's own account, he made up the remaining deficiency from his own resources. His biographer Roland Huntford records that the final deficit of NOK 12,000 was cleared by two wealthy supporters, Axel Heiberg and an English expatriate, Charles Dick.  Ship  Section and Plan drawings for Fram, as agreed between Nansen and shipbuilder Colin Archer To design and build his ship Nansen chose Colin Archer, Norway's leading shipbuilder and naval architect. Archer was well known for a particular hull design that combined seaworthiness with a shallow draught, and had pioneered the design of \\"double- ended\\" craft in which the conventional stern was replaced by a point, increasing manoeuvrability. Nansen records that Archer made \\"plan after plan of the projected ship; one model after another was prepared and abandoned\\". Finally, agreement was reached on a design, and on 9 June 1891 the two men signed the contract. Nansen wanted the ship in one year; he was eager to get away before anyone else could adopt his ideas and forestall him. The ship's most significant external feature was the roundness of the hull, designed so that there was nothing upon which the ice could get a grip. Bow, stern and keel were rounded off, and the sides smoothed so that, in Nansen's words, the vessel would \\"slip like an eel out of the embraces of the ice\\". To give exceptional strength the hull was sheathed in South American greenheart, the hardest timber available. The three layers of wood forming the hull provided a combined thickness of between 24 and 28 inches (60‚Äì70 cm), increasing to around 48 inches (1.25 metres) at the bow, which was further protected by a protruding iron stem. Added strength was provided by crossbeams and braces throughout the length of the hull. Colin Archer, designer and builder of Fram The ship was rigged as a three-masted schooner, with a total sail area of . Its auxiliary engine of 220 horse-power was capable of speeds up to . However, speed and sailing qualities were secondary to the requirement of providing a safe and warm stronghold for Nansen and his crew during a drift that might extend for several years, so particular attention was paid to the insulation of the living quarters. At around 400 gross register tonnage, the ship was considerably larger than Nansen had first anticipated, with an overall length of and a breadth of , a ratio of just over three to one, giving her an unusually stubby appearance. This odd shape was explained by Archer: \\"A ship that is built with exclusive regard to its suitability for [Nansen's] object must differ essentially from any known vessel.\\"Archer, quoted in . On 6 October 1892, at Archer's yard at Larvik, the ship was launched by Nansen's wife Eva after a brief ceremony. The ship was named Fram, meaning \\"Forward\\".  Crew  For his Greenland expedition of 1888‚Äì89 Nansen had departed from the traditional dependence on large-scale personnel, ships and backup, relying instead on a small well-trained group. Using the same principle for the Fram voyage, Nansen chose a party of just twelve from the thousands of applications that poured in from all over the world. One applicant was the 20-year-old Roald Amundsen, future conqueror of the South Pole, whose mother stopped him from going. The English explorer Frederick Jackson applied, but Nansen wanted only Norwegians, so Jackson organised his own expedition to Franz Josef Land. To captain the ship and act as the expedition's second-in-command Nansen chose Otto Sverdrup, an experienced sailor who had taken part in the Greenland crossing. Theodore Jacobsen, who had experience in the Arctic as skipper of a sloop, signed on as Fram's mate, and a young naval lieutenant, Sigurd Scott Hansen, took charge of meteorological and magnetic observations. The ship's doctor, and the expedition's botanist, was Henrik Blessing, who graduated in medicine just before Fram's sailing date. Hjalmar Johansen, an army reserve lieutenant and dog-driving expert, was so determined to join the expedition that he agreed to sign on as stoker, the only position by then available. Likewise Adolf Juell, with 20 years' experience at sea as mate and captain, took the post of cook on the Fram voyage. Ivar Mogstad was an official at Gaustad psychiatric hospital, but his technical abilities as a handyman and mechanic impressed Nansen. The oldest man in the party, at 40, was the chief engineer, Anton Amundsen (no relation of Roald). The second engineer, Lars Pettersen, kept his Swedish nationality from Nansen, and although it was soon discovered by his shipmates, he was allowed to remain with the expedition, the only non-Norwegian in the party. The remaining crew members were Peter Henriksen, Bernhard Nordahl and Bernt Bentzen, the last‚Äìnamed joining the expedition in Troms√∏ at very short notice.  Voyage  Routes taken during the 1893‚Äì96 Fram expedition:  Journey to the ice  Before the start of the voyage Nansen decided to deviate from his original plan: instead of following Jeannette's route to the New Siberian Islands by way of the Bering Strait, he would make a shorter journey, taking Nordenski√∂ld's North-East Passage along the northern coast of Siberia. Fram left Christiania on 24 June 1893, seen on her way by a cannon salute from the fort and the cheers of thousands of well-wishers. This was the first of a series of farewells as Fram sailed round the coast and moved northward, reaching Bergen on 1 July (where there was a great banquet in Nansen's honour), Trondheim on 5 July and Troms√∏, north of the Arctic Circle, a week later. The last Norwegian port of call was Vard√∏, where Fram arrived on 18 July. After the final provisions were taken on board, Nansen, Sverdrup, Hansen and Blessing spent their last hours ashore in a sauna, being beaten with birch twigs by two young girls. The first leg of the journey eastward took Fram across the Barents Sea towards Novaya Zemlya and then to the North Russian settlement of Khabarova where the first batch of dogs was brought on board. On 3 August Fram weighed anchor and moved cautiously eastward, entering the Kara Sea the next day. Few ships had sailed the Kara Sea before, and charts were incomplete. On 18 August, in the area of the Yenisei River delta, an uncharted island was discovered and named Sverdrup Island after Fram's commander. Fram was now moving towards the Taimyr Peninsula and Cape Chelyuskin, the most northerly point of the Eurasian continental mass. Heavy ice slowed the expedition's progress, and at the end of August it was held up for four days while the ship's boiler was repaired and cleaned. The crew also experienced the dead water phenomenon, where a ship's forward progress is impeded by energy dissipation caused by a layer of fresh water lying on top of heavier salt water. On 9 September a wide stretch of ice-free water opened up, and next day Fram rounded Cape Chelyuskin‚Äîthe second ship to do so, after Nordenski√∂ld's Vega in 1878‚Äîand entered the Laptev Sea. After being prevented by ice from reaching the mouth of the Olenyok River, where a second batch of dogs was waiting to be picked up, Fram moved north and east towards the New Siberian Islands. Nansen's hope was to find open water to 80¬∞ north latitude and then enter the pack; however, on 20 September ice was sighted just south of 78¬∞. Fram followed the line of the ice before stopping in a small bay beyond the 78¬∞ mark. On 28 September it became evident that the ice would not break up, and the dogs were moved from the ship to kennels on the ice. On 5 October the rudder was raised to a position of safety and the ship, in Scott Hansen's words, was \\"well and truly moored for the winter\\". The position was 78¬∞49‚Ä≤N, 132¬∞53‚Ä≤E.  Drift (first phase)  On 9 October Fram had her first experience of ice pressure. Archer's design was quickly vindicated as the ship rose and fell, the ice being unable to grip the hull. Otherwise the first weeks in the ice were disappointing, as the unpredictable drift moved Fram in gyratory fashion, sometimes north, sometimes south; by 19 November, after six weeks, Fram was south of the latitude at which she had entered the ice. Hjalmar Johansen, Fram's stoker and dog-driving expert, Nansen's chosen companion for the North Pole dash After the sun disappeared on 25 October the ship was lit by electric lamps from a wind- powered generator. The crew settled down to a comfortable routine in which boredom and inactivity were the main enemies. Men began to irritate each other, and fights sometimes broke out. Nansen attempted to start a newspaper, but the project soon fizzled out through lack of interest. Small tasks were undertaken and scientific observations maintained, but there was no urgency. Nansen expressed his frustration in his journal: \\"I feel I must break through this deadness, this inertia, and find some outlet for my energies.\\" And later: \\"Can't something happen? Could not a hurricane come and tear up this ice?\\" Only after the turn of the year, in January 1894, did the northerly direction become generally settled. The 80¬∞ mark was finally passed on 22 March. Based on the uncertain direction and slow speed of the drift, Nansen calculated that it might take the ship five years to reach the pole. In January 1894 he had first discussed with both Henriksen and Johansen the possibility of making a sledge journey with the dogs, from Fram to the pole, though they made no immediate plans. Nansen's first attempts to master dog-driving were an embarrassing failure, but he persevered and gradually achieved better results. He also discovered that the normal cross-country skiing speed was the same as that of dogs pulling loaded sledges. Men could travel under their own power, skiing, rather than riding on the sledge, and loads could be correspondingly increased. This, according to biographer and historian Roland Huntford, amounted to a revolution in polar travel methods. Fram, held in the ice, March 1894 On 19 May, two days after the celebrations for Norway's National Day, Fram passed 81¬∞, indicating that the ship's northerly speed was slowly increasing, though it was still barely a mile (1.6 km) a day. With a growing conviction that a sledge journey might be necessary to reach the pole, in September Nansen decreed that everyone would practice skiing for two hours a day. On 16 November he revealed his intention to the crew: he and one companion would leave the ship and start for the pole when the 83¬∞ mark was passed. After reaching the pole the pair would make for Franz Josef Land, and then cross to Spitsbergen where they hoped to find a ship to take them home. Three days later Nansen asked Hjalmar Johansen, the most experienced dog- driver among the crew, to join him on the polar journey. The crew spent the following months preparing for the forthcoming dash for the pole. On the Inuit model, they built qamutit that would facilitate fast travel over rough sea ice terrain and constructed kayaks for use during the expected water crossings. There were endless trials of special clothing and other gear. Violent and prolonged tremors began to shake the ship on 3 January 1895, and two days later the crew disembarked, expecting the ship to be crushed. Instead the pressure lessened, and the crew went back on board and resumed preparations for Nansen's journey. After the excitement it was noted that Fram had drifted beyond Greely's Farthest North record of 83¬∞24, and on 8 January was at 83¬∞34‚Ä≤N.  March for the Pole  Nansen and Johansen finally depart on their polar journey, 14 March 1895. Nansen is the tall figure, second from left; Johansen is standing second from right. On 17 February 1895 Nansen began a farewell letter to his wife, Eva, writing that should he come to grief \\"you will know that your image will be the last I see.\\" He was also reading everything he could about Franz Josef Land, his intended destination after the pole. The archipelago had been discovered in 1873 by Julius Payer, and was incompletely mapped. It was, however, apparently the home of countless bears and seals, and Nansen saw it as an excellent food source on his return journey to civilization. On 14 March, with the ship at 84¬∞4‚Ä≤N, the pair finally began their polar march. This was their third attempt to leave the ship; on 26 February and again on the 28th, damage to sledges had forced them to return after travelling short distances. After these mishaps Nansen thoroughly overhauled his equipment, minimised the travelling stores, recalculated weights and reduced the convoy to three sledges, before giving the order to start again. A supporting party accompanied the pair and shared the first night's camp. The next day, Nansen and Johansen skied on alone. The pair initially traveled mainly over flat snowfields. Nansen had allowed 50 days to cover the to the pole, requiring an average daily journey of seven nautical miles (13 km; 8.1 mi). On 22 March a sextant observation showed that the pair had travelled towards the pole at a daily average of over nine nautical miles (17 km; 10 mi). This had been achieved despite very low temperatures, typically around , and small scale mishaps including the loss of the sledgemeter that recorded mileage. However, as the surfaces became uneven and made skiing more difficult, their speeds slowed. A sextant reading on 29 March of 85¬∞56‚Ä≤N indicated that a week's travel had brought them nearer to the pole, but also showed that their average daily distances were falling. More worryingly, a theodolite reading that day suggested that they were at only 85¬∞15‚Ä≤N, and they had no means of knowing which of the readings was correct. They realised that they were fighting a southerly drift, and that distances travelled did not necessarily equate to northerly progression. Johansen's diary indicated his failing spirits: \\"My fingers are all destroyed. All mittens are frozen stiff ... It is becoming worse and worse ... God knows what will happen to us\\". Artist's impression of Nansen and Johansen's northernmost camp, 86¬∞13.6‚Ä≤N on 7 April 1895 On 3 April, after days of difficult travel, Nansen privately began to wonder if the pole might, after all, be out of reach. Unless the surface improved, their food would not last them to the pole and then on to Franz Josef Land. The next day they calculated their position at a disappointing 86¬∞3'; Nansen confided in his diary that: \\"I have become more and more convinced we ought to turn before time.\\" After making camp on 7 April Nansen scouted ahead on snowshoes looking for a path forward, but saw only \\"a veritable chaos of iceblocks stretching as far as the horizon\\". He decided that they would go no further north, and would head for Cape Fligely in Franz Josef Land. Nansen recorded the latitude of their final northerly camp as 86¬∞13.6‚Ä≤N, almost three degrees (169.6 nautical miles, or 314 km) beyond Greely's previous Farthest North mark.  Retreat to Franz Josef Land  The change of direction to south-west provided much better travelling conditions, probably because the course to Franz Josef Land was broadly parallel to the lines of disturbance in the ice instead of perpendicular to them. Progress was swift: \\"If this goes on,\\" Nansen recorded on 13 April, \\"the return journey will be quicker than I thought.\\" However, the same diary entry records a mishap that day: both men's watches had stopped. Although Nansen's journal comment is mild, the incident was potentially disastrous. Without the correct time they could not calculate their longitude and thus maintain the correct course to Franz Josef Land. They restarted the watches based on Nansen's guesswork that their longitude was 86¬∞E, but the pair were no longer certain where they were. If they were farther west than Nansen's assumption, they might miss Franz Josef Land altogether, and head for the open Atlantic. The direction of the drift became northerly, hampering the pair's progress. By 18 April, after 11 days' travel from Farthest North, they had only made to the south. They now travelled over much more broken terrain with wide open leads of water. On about 20 April they were cheered by the sight of a large piece of driftwood stuck in a floe, the first object from the outside world they had seen since Fram had entered the ice. Johansen carved his and Nansen's initials on it, with the latitude and date. A day or two later they spotted the tracks of an Arctic fox, the first trace of a living creature other than their dogs since leaving Fram. Other tracks soon appeared, and Nansen began to believe that land might be near. Map of Franz Josef Land showing the route of Nansen and Johansen through the islands, August 1895 to June 1896 The latitude calculated on 9 May, 84¬∞3‚Ä≤N, was disappointing‚ÄîNansen had hoped they were farther south. However, as May progressed they began to see bear tracks, and by the end of the month seals, gulls and whales were plentiful. By Nansen's calculations, they had reached 82¬∞21‚Ä≤N on 31 May, placing them only from Cape Fligely at the northern extremity of Franz Josef Land, if his longitude estimate was accurate. In the warmer weather the ice began to break up, making travel more difficult. Since 24 April dogs had been killed at regular intervals to feed the others, and by the beginning of June only seven of the original 28 remained. On 21 June the pair jettisoned all surplus equipment and supplies, planning to travel light and live off the now plentiful supplies of seal and birds. After a day's travel in this manner they decided to rest on a floe, waterproof the kayaks and build up their own strength for the next stage of their journey. They remained camped on the floe for a whole month. On 23 July, the day after leaving the camp, Nansen had the first indisputable glimpse of land. He wrote: \\"At last the marvel has come to pass‚Äîland, land, and after we had almost given up our belief in it!\\" In the succeeding days the pair struggled towards this land, which seemingly grew no nearer, although by the end of July they could hear the distant sound of breaking surf. On 4 August they survived a polar bear attack; two days later they reached the edge of the ice, and only water lay between them and the land. On 6 August they shot the last two Samoyed dogs, converted the kayaks into a catamaran by lashing sledges and skis across them, and raised a sail. Nansen called this first land \\"Hvidtenland\\" (\\"White Island\\"). After making camp on an ice foot they ascended a slope and looked about them. It was apparent that they were in an archipelago, but what they could see bore no relation to their incomplete map of Franz Josef Land. They could only continue south in the hopes of finding a geographical feature they could pinpoint with certainty. On 16 August Nansen tentatively identified a headland as Cape Felder, marked on Payer's maps as on the western coast of Franz Josef Land. Nansen's objective was now to reach a hut and supplies that had been left by an earlier expedition at a location known as Eira Harbour, at the southern end of the islands. However, contrary winds and loose ice made further progress in the kayak hazardous, and on 28 August Nansen decided that, with another polar winter drawing near, they should stay where they were and await the following spring.  To Cape Flora  The hut on Franz Josef Land, covered in snow, in which Nansen and Johansen spent the winter of 1895‚Äì96. A drawing, based on Nansen's photograph. As the base for their winter quarters, Nansen and Johansen found a beach in a sheltered cove on what is now called Jackson Island, with a plentiful supply of stones and moss for building materials. They excavated a hole three feet deep, raised walls around it using loose rocks and stones, and stretched walrus skins over the top to form a roof. A chimney was improvised using snow and walrus bones. This shelter, which they called \\"The Hole\\", was finally ready on 28 September, and was to be their home for the next eight months. Their situation was uncomfortable, but not life- threatening; there was a plentiful supply of bear, walrus and seal to stock up their larder. The chief enemy was boredom; to pass time they were reduced to reading Nansen's sailing almanac and navigation tables by the light of their blubber lamp, and then reading them again. At Christmas the pair celebrated with chocolate and bread from their sledging rations. On New Year's Eve Johansen recorded that Nansen finally adopted the familiar form of address, having until then maintained formalities (\\"Mr Johansen\\", \\"Professor Nansen\\") throughout the journey. In the New Year they fashioned themselves simple outer clothing‚Äîsmocks and trousers‚Äîfrom a discarded sleeping bag, in readiness for the resumption of their journey when the weather grew warmer. On 19 May 1896, after weeks of preparation, they were ready. Nansen left a note in the hut to inform a possible finder: \\"We are going south west, along the land, to cross over to Spitsbergen\\". For more than two weeks they followed the shoreline southwards. Nothing they saw seemed to fit with their rudimentary map of Franz Josef Land, and Nansen speculated whether they were in uncharted lands between Franz Josef Land and Spitsbergen. On 4 June a change in conditions allowed them to launch their kayaks for the first time since leaving their winter quarters. A week later, Nansen was forced to dive into the icy waters to rescue the kayaks which, still tied together, had drifted away after being carelessly moored. He managed to reach the craft and, with a last effort, to haul himself aboard. Despite his frozen condition he shot and retrieved two guillemots as he paddled the catamaran back. Cape Flora, 17 June 1896 (a posed photograph taken hours after the initial meeting) On 13 June walruses attacked and damaged the kayaks, causing another stop for repairs. On 17 June, as they prepared to leave again, Nansen thought he heard a dog bark and went to investigate. He then heard voices, and a few minutes later encountered a human being. It was Frederick Jackson, who had organised his own expedition to Franz Josef Land after being rejected by Nansen, and had based his headquarters at Cape Flora on Northbrook Island, the southernmost island of the archipelago. Jackson's own account records that his first reaction to this sudden meeting was to assume the figure to be a shipwrecked sailor, perhaps from the expedition's supply ship Windward which was due to call that summer. As he approached, Jackson saw \\"a tall man, wearing a soft felt hat, loosely made, voluminous clothes and long shaggy hair and beard, all reeking with black grease\\". After a moment's awkward hesitation, Jackson recognised his visitor: \\"You are Nansen, aren't you?\\", and received the reply \\"Yes, I am Nansen.\\" Johansen was rescued, and the pair taken to the base at Cape Flora, where they posed for photographs (in one instance re-enacting the Jackson‚ÄìNansen meeting) before taking baths and haircuts. Both men seemed in good health, despite their ordeal; Nansen had put on in weight since the start of the expedition, and Johansen . In honour of his rescuer, Nansen named the island where he had wintered \\"Frederick Jackson Island\\". For the next six weeks Nansen had little to do but await the arrival of Windward, worrying that he might have to spend the winter at Cape Flora, and sometimes regretting that he and Johansen had not pressed on to Spitsbergen. Johansen noted in his journal that Nansen had changed from the overbearing personality of the Fram days, and was now subdued and polite, adamant that he would never undertake such a journey again. On 26 July Windward finally arrived; on 7 August, with Nansen and Johansen aboard, she sailed south and on 13 August reached Vard√∏. A batch of telegrams was sent, informing the world of Nansen's safe return.  Drift (second phase)  A lead of water opens in front of Fram, May 1896 Before his departure from Fram, Nansen appointed Sverdrup as leader of the rest of the expedition, with orders to continue with the drift towards the Atlantic Ocean unless circumstances warranted abandoning the ship and marching for land. Nansen left precise instructions about keeping up the scientific work, especially the ocean depth soundings and the tests for the thickness of the ice. He concluded: \\"May we meet in Norway, whether it be on board of this vessel or without her.\\" Sverdrup's main task now was to keep his crew busy. He ordered a thorough spring cleaning, and set a party to chip away some of the surrounding ice which was threatening to destabilise the ship. Although there was no immediate danger to Fram, Sverdrup oversaw the repair and overhaul of sledges, and the organisation of provisions should it after all be necessary to abandon ship and march to land. With the arrival of warmer weather as the 1895 summer approached, Sverdrup resumed daily ski practice. Amid these activities a full programme of meteorological, magnetic and oceanographic activities continued under Scott Hansen; Fram had become a moving oceanographic, meteorological and biological laboratory. As the drift proceeded the ocean became deeper; soundings gave successive depths of , and , a progression which indicated that no undiscovered land mass was nearby. On 15 November 1895 Fram reached 85¬∞55‚Ä≤N, only below Nansen's Farthest North mark. From this point on, the drift was generally to the south and west, although progress was for long periods almost imperceptible. Inactivity and boredom led to increased drinking; Scott Hansen recorded that Christmas and New Year passed \\"with the usual hot punch and consequent hangover\\", and wrote that he was \\"getting more and more disgusted with drunkenness\\". By mid-March 1896, the position was 84¬∞25‚Ä≤N, 12¬∞50‚Ä≤E, placing the ship north of Spitsbergen. On 13 June a lead opened and, for the first time in nearly three years, Fram became a living ship. It was a further two months, on 13 August 1896, before she found open water and, with a blast from her cannon, left the ice behind. She had emerged from the ice just north and west of Spitsbergen, close to Nansen's original prediction, proving him right and his detractors wrong. Later that same day a ship was sighted‚ÄîS√∏strone, a seal hunter from Troms√∏. Sverdrup rowed across for news, and learned that nothing had been heard from Nansen. Fram called briefly at Spitsbergen, where the Swedish explorer-engineer Salomon Andr√©e was preparing for the balloon flight that he hoped would take him to the pole. After a short time ashore, Sverdrup and his crew began the trip south to Norway.  Reunion and reception  The port of Vard√∏ in northern Norway, where Nansen and Johansen returned to Norwegian soil on 13 August 1896 In the course of the expedition, rumours circulated that Nansen had reached the North Pole, the first as early as April 1894, in the French Newspaper Le Figaro. In September 1895 Eva Nansen was informed that messages signed by Nansen had been discovered, \\"sent from the North Pole\\". In February 1896 The New York Times ran a dispatch from Irkutsk, in Siberia, from a supposed Nansen agent, claiming that Nansen had reached the pole and found land there. Charles P. Daly of the American Geographical Society called this \\"startling news\\" and, \\"if true, the most important discovery that has been made in ages.\\" Experts were sceptical of all such reports, and Nansen's arrival in Vard√∏ quickly put paid to them. In Vard√∏, he and Johansen were greeted by Professor Mohn, the originator of the polar drift theory, who was in the town by chance. The pair waited for the weekly mail steamer to take them south, and on 18 August arrived in Hammerfest to an enthusiastic reception. The lack of news about Fram was preying on Nansen's mind; however, on 20 August he received news that Sverdrup had brought the ship to the tiny port of Skjerv√∏y, south of Hammerfest, and was now continuing with her to Troms√∏. The next day, Nansen and Johansen sailed into Troms√∏ and joined their comrades in an emotional reunion. After days of celebration and recuperation the ship left Troms√∏ on 26 August. The voyage south was a triumphal procession, with receptions at every port. Fram finally arrived in Christiania on 9 September, escorted into the harbour by a squadron of warships and welcomed by thousands‚Äîthe largest crowds the city had ever seen, according to Huntford. Nansen and his crew were received by King Oscar; on the way to the reception they passed through a triumphal arch formed by 200 gymnasts. Nansen and his family stayed at the palace as special guests of the king; by contrast, Johansen remained in the background, largely overlooked, and writing that \\"reality, after all, is not so wonderful as it appeared to me in the midst of our hard life.\\"  Assessment and aftermath  Expedition members after Fram's return to Christiania in August 1896. Back row, l. to r.: Blessing, Nordhal, Mogstad, Henriksen, Pettersen, Johansen. Seated: Bentzen, Scott Hansen, Sverdrup, Amundsen (with dog), Jacobsen, Nansen, Juell The traditional approach to Arctic exploration had relied on large-scale forces, with a presumption that European techniques could be successfully transplanted into the hostile polar climate. Over the years this strategy had brought little success, and had led to heavy losses of men and ships. By contrast, Nansen's method of using small, trained crews, and harnessing Inuit and Sami expertise in his methods of travel, had ensured that his expedition was completed without a single casualty or major mishap. Although it did not achieve the objective of reaching the North Pole, the expedition made major geographical and scientific discoveries. Sir Clements Markham, president of Britain's Royal Geographical Society, declared that the expedition had resolved \\"the whole problem of Arctic geography\\". It was now established that the North Pole was located not on land, nor on a permanent ice sheet, but on shifting, unpredictable pack ice. The Arctic Ocean was a deep basin, with no significant land masses north of the Eurasian continent‚Äîany hidden expanse of land would have blocked the free movement of ice. Nansen had proved the polar drift theory; furthermore, he had noted the presence of a Coriolis force driving the ice to the right of the wind direction, due to the effect of the Earth's rotation. This discovery would be developed by Nansen's pupil, Vagn Walfrid Ekman, who later became the leading oceanographer of his time. From its programme of scientific observation the expedition provided the first detailed oceanographic information from the area; in due course the scientific data gathered during the Fram voyage would run to six published volumes. Throughout the expedition Nansen continued to experiment with equipment and techniques, altering the designs of skis and sledges and investigating types of clothing, tents and cooking apparatus, thereby revolutionising methods of Arctic travel. In the era of polar exploration which followed his return, explorers routinely sought Nansen's advice as to methods and equipment‚Äîalthough sometimes they chose not to follow it, usually to their cost. According to Huntford, the South Pole heroes Amundsen, Scott, and Ernest Shackleton were all Nansen's acolytes. Nansen's status was never seriously challenged, although he did not escape criticism. American explorer Robert Peary wondered why Nansen had not returned to the ship when his polar dash was thwarted after a mere three weeks away. \\"Was he ashamed to go back after so short an absence, or had there been a row ... or did he go off for Franz Josef Land from sensational motives or business reasons?\\" Adolphus Greely, who had initially dismissed the entire expedition as infeasible, admitted that he had been proved wrong but nevertheless drew attention to \\"the single blemish\\"‚ÄîNansen's decision to leave his comrades hundreds of miles from land. \\"It passes comprehension\\", Greely wrote, \\"how Nansen could have thus deviated from the most sacred duty devolving on the commander of a naval expedition.\\" Nansen's reputation nevertheless survived; a hundred years after the expedition the British explorer Wally Herbert called the Fram voyage \\"one of the most inspiring examples of courageous intelligence in the history of exploration\\". The Fram voyage was Nansen's final expedition. He was appointed to a research professorship at the University of Christiania in 1897, and to a full professorship in oceanography in 1908. He became independently wealthy as a result of the publication of his expedition account; in his later career he served the newly independent kingdom of Norway in different capacities, and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 1922, in recognition of his work on behalf of refugees. Hjalmar Johansen never settled back into normal life. After years of drifting, debt and drunkenness he was given the opportunity, through Nansen's influence, to join Roald Amundsen's South Pole expedition in 1910. Johansen quarreled violently with Amundsen at the expedition's base camp, and was omitted from the South Pole party. He committed suicide within a year of his return from Antarctica. Otto Sverdrup remained as captain of Fram, and in 1898 took the ship, with a new crew, to the Canadian Arctic for four years' exploration. In later years Sverdrup helped to raise funds that enabled the ship to be restored and housed in a permanent museum. He died in November 1930, seven months after Nansen's death. Nansen's farthest north record lasted for just over five years. On 24 April 1900 a party of three from an Italian expedition led by the Duke of the Abruzzi reached 86¬∞34‚Ä≤N, having left Franz Josef Land with dogs and sledges on 11 March. The party barely made it back; one of their support groups of three men vanished entirely.

Songwriting After graduation in 1961, he mostly made his living as a songwriter, writing the lyrics for a number of Slovenian pop songs, including the 1962 song \\"The Earth is Dancing,\\" which won an award at the first Slovenian song festival. Despite it, he considered songwriting a degradation compared to writing poetry.

The 'g' in gTissue is considered a reference to both generated nature of the living tissue, but also to the generative ability of the tissue to be adapted to the dynamic environmental conditions experienced in the host. Overview gTissue is a type of living Tissue (biology), hence an ensemble of cells and extracellular matrix that carry out a particular function. However, gTissue is created surgically, grown in a patient, and has a unique cellular and biochemical make-up that make it distinct from other tissues of the body. gTissue was discovered through research in the fields of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine and first created as a dense connective tissue between the brain and skull during the repair of canine dura mater.Zerris et al. Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part B, Volume 83B Issue 2, Pages 580 - 588, 2007 Article It has since been successfully created in humans for a wide range of clinical applications in soft tissue healing and repair.Cornwell, Landsman, James. Extracellular Matrix Biomaterials for Soft Tissue Repair. Clin Podiatr Med Surg 26 (2009) 507‚Äì523 Article Essentially, the gTissue is created by implanting certain types of non-inflammatory ECM biomaterials that are adopted by the host, including repopulation with host cells and blood vessels, becoming a living tissue. To date, the types of gTissue created can be characterized as variants of soft connective tissues including dermis, tendon, ligament, and fascia. Generation of (Adoption) Initially the cell-free ECM biomaterial is implanted and progressively adopted by the host. Immediately upon surgical implantation, the porous material becomes soaked in blood. This seeds the material with a population of circulating stem cells, and growth factors to support gTissue development. As generation progresses, the growth factors, cytokines, and fibrin provisional matrix signals host cells to repopulate the matrix. To support the metabolic activity of these cells, a vascular network is simultaneously created within the ECM biomaterial. At this stage the material has been adopted and has the characteristics of a living tissue (biology). Under some conditions, following adoption with host cells and vasculature, gTissue can persist indefinitely without any histological evidence of significant change. For example, when created to below the skin of the face in cosmetic procedures intended to add bulk, the gTissue is adopted and stays a living, metabolically active tissue, subdermally. Adaptation of While gTissue can live indefinitely following adoption without significant change, there are environmental conditions that support the adaption of the tissue. The adaptation of gTissue is one reason it considered a generative tissue. Adaptation includes any change to the gTissue to meet particular environmental demands placed on it, based on the location of implantation. For example, during tendon augmentation procedures, the collagen fiber architecture of the extracellular matrix can transition to an aligned structure similar to native tendon, oriented along the long axis of loading, to meet the mechanical loading requirements. Or when used as an underlay beneath the muscles of the abdominal wall to support the repair of a hernia, gTissue is adapted forming a new mesothelium lining the peritoneal side in order to prevent adhesions to, or abrasion of, the bowel or small intestines. Requirements In order to create gTissue, a surgeon must start by selecting and ECM biomaterial with appropriate characteristics to support the type of healing and repair desired. The ECM biomaterial must be non- inflammatory. Biomaterials that evoke a strong inflammatory response are rapidly remodeled into scar tissue.Valentin JE, Badylak JS, McCabe GP, et al. Extracellular matrix bioscaffolds for orthopaedic applications. A comparative histologic study. J Bone Joint Surg Am 2006;88(12):2673‚Äì86. Article The ECM biomaterial must also not cause a chronic, low grade inflammatory response, or the material will be steadily degraded and therefore disappear with time.Hwang K, Hwang JH, et al. Experimental study of autologous cartilage, acellular cadaveric dermis, lyophilized bovine pericardium, and irradiated bovine tendon: applicability to nasal tip plasty. J Craniofac Surg 2007;18(3):551‚Äì8 Article on Pubmed Examples of ECM biomaterials that meet these requirements and have been successfully used to create gTissue include SurgiMend,SurgiMend, TEI Biosciences Inc. Website TissueMend,TissueMend, Stryker Orthopaedics Website and Durepair.Durepair, Medtronic Website Additionally, the surgeon must be aware of how the anatomical location and surgical procedure affect host adoption and adaptation in order to grow the desired gTissue. For example, if the gTissue is to persist without change to add bulk, the implanted ECM biomaterial must be placed under low tension.

She usually sang in Hassaniyya, an Arabic dialect spoken mostly in Western Sahara and Mauritania, and occasionally in Spanish. Her use of the Spanish language was related to the former status of Western Sahara as a Spanish colony. Biography=Life Mariem Hassan was born in May 1958 in the Ued Tazua, 20 km. away from Smara, Spanish Sahara. She was the third of ten siblings in a nomadic family. Music and poetry was important in the family and various relatives were singers, poets or dancers. In 1975, following the Green March and the Madrid Accords which ceded the territory to Morocco and Mauritania, she went with her family, first to Meharrize and finally to the Sahrawi refugee camps in Tindouf, Algeria, where she worked as nurse. Three of her brothers were killed during the Western Sahara War. She lived there until 2002, when for work and health reasons she moved to Spain, first to Barcelona and then to Sabadell, where she lived with her husband and sons. She returned to Western Sahara some time prior to her death in 2015. Career In early 1976, Hassan joined the musical group Shahid El Hafed Buyema, which, following the death in combat of El-Ouali Mustapha Sayed, first president of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, became Shahid El Uali. She travelled with the band to many countries, playing at cultural events and headlining a number of world music festivals. In 1998, Shadid El Uali disbanded, and Hassan started her solo career with a pair of songs on the album A pesar de las heridas, released by the Spanish label Nubenegra. For the following concerts in Europe, she was accompanied by the group Leyoad (in which Nayim Alal plays the guitar). Following the success of their live performances, they recorded in 2000 a collaboration album, Mariem Hassan con Leyoad (in 2002). In 2004, she contributed to the album Medej, followed by extensive touring in Europe (Barcelona, Madrid, Leipzig, Helsinki, Brussels, Zurich, Antwerp). Just before departing for her European tour, she received a diagnosis of breast cancer. She began receiving treatment after returning to Spain, staying there on a permanent basis due to the disease. In 2005, her real first solo album was released. Deseos (Wishes), a personal interpretation of the traditional Haul music. It doesn't reveal the tragedies happening during its recording: the death from leukemia of Baba Salama (producer of the album and lead guitarist) before the album was published and Hassan's struggle with breast cancer. In March 2005, she was hospitalized in Spain for treatment. One of the highlights of the album is the \\"desert blues\\" song \\"La Tumchu anni\\". Hassan performed at the WOMEX 2005 in Newcastle, and in several editions and locations of WOMAD festival, as WOMAD Las Palmas de Gran Canaria 2008, WOMAD C√°ceres 2008, WOMAD Charlton Park 2009, WOMAD Sicily 2009, WOMADelaide 2010 and WOMAD New Zealand 2010. In 2010, a new album was published. Shouka (The Thorn) represented a deep approach to the Haul and even the roots of Azawan music, but also with western influences. The main song \\"Shouka\\" is structured as a cantata, touching all the rhythms of the Sahrawi traditional music, in which Mariem gives a response paragraph by paragraph to the 1976 speech of Felipe Gonz√°lez at the Sahrawi refugee camps. Some critics compared her sound with Tuareg bands like Tinariwen, while others denied similarities. In March 2011, she performed for three consecutive days in Caracas, Venezuela, during the \\"Sahrawi Cultural Week\\".La Voz del Desierto, Mariem Hassan en Caracas Corneta.org ‚Äì Semanario Cultural de Caracas, 17 al 23 de Marzo 2011, n¬∫ 141 Esta semana est√° dedicada a la cultura de la Rep√∫blica Saharaui Correo del Orinoco, 15 March 2011 In late March 2012, her third solo album titled El Aaiun Egdat (El Aaiun on fire), inspired by the Sahrawi protests during and after the Gdeim Izik protest camp and the \\"Arab Spring\\", was published. This work marked a musical change, including blues and jazz sounds to the traditional haul structures. Several songs had lyrics written by old Sahrawi poets in exile, like Ali Bachir and Lamin Allal. A European tour for the album began at the World Village Festival in Helsinki, Finland on 27 April. In June, she played with her band in Chiasso, SwitzerlandMariem Hassan Chiasso Cultura, Festate.ch Her album El Aaiun Egdat reached from the start a number 1 in the World Music Charts Europe in July 2012. In November, Mariem Hassan was one of the headlining acts of the III edition of the \\"Festival du Sahel\\", a music festival taking place in the Lompoul desert, Senegal.Programming Festivaldusahel.com In 2013 Mariem Hassan completed both a Sahrawi oral history project, Cu√©ntame Abuelo ‚Äì M√∫sica, and a tour to promote the album El Aaiun Egdat. During this tour she performed European venues such as Malmo and Goteborg (at the Clandestino Festival) in Sweden, in Portugal, in Marseilles at the Babel Med Festival, in Rome at the ninth Mojo Station Blues Festival, at the Desert Session in Salento (Southern Italy), in Belgium and in Spain. =In media= Hassan was the subject of a 2007 documentary film, Mariem Hassan, la voz del S√°hara.Mariem Hassan: the Voice of the Sahara Melbourne Filmoteca. In 2010, Link TV produced a short documentary on Hassan's music and activism, as part of the series \\"Rappers, Divas and Virtuosos: New Music from the Muslim World.\\" In October 2014, Calamar Edicion y Dise√±o published Hassan's official biography in the form of a graphic novel, Mariem Hassan ‚Äì Soy Saharaui, written and illustrated by Italian authors Gianluca Diana, Andromalis, and Federica Marzioni. In 2017 Manuel Dom√≠nguez and Zazie Schubert-Wurr published their adventures with Mariem Hassan in her concert tours for 18 years. \\"The Indomitable Voice\\" was published in English and Spanish by Nubenegra. A year later the German version was published by Frieling editorial. The book contains her last album \\"La Voz Ind√≥mita\\" and a DVD.  Death  Hassan died of bone cancer in the Sahrawi refugee camps of Tindouf province, Algeria on 22 August 2015. Noted lyrics Among her works is the Spanish language song \\"Tus ojos lloran\\" (\\"Your eyes weep\\"), dealing with her personal experience of a woman coping with the sufferings of life and bereavement (the deaths of her father and two of her brothers).

After Trenchard had retired from the Royal Air Force in 1930, he largely disappeared from public life. However, in March 1931, the British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald asked Trenchard to take the post of Metropolitan Police Commissioner, which Trenchard declined. MacDonald had been concerned about unrest in the police and Trenchard was seen as strong-minded military man. By October the political crisis resulting from the Great Depression had deepened and when MacDonald offered the post again, Trenchard accepted.Boyle 1962:pp. 581-593 One of Trenchard's early reforms was the abolition of the scheduled beat system and in 1933 he instigated changes for the improvement of police residences known as section houses. In May 1932, Trenchard first annual report as Commissioner was published. The report proposed sweeping changes and indirectly called into question the reliability of the police in a major emergency. After adverse reactions in the press and questions in Parliament, the Home Secretary Sir John Gilmour stated that Trenchard's report would be published as a White Paper, giving MPs an opportunity to debate the issues. In very quick order the White Paper was turned into a Government Bill. The first two clauses of the Bill, which proposed to increase the number of assistant commissioners from four to five and lower the age of retirement for senior officers, did not prove too controversial. However, the clauses which set out limitations on membership of the Police Federation were hotly debated and characterized by left-wing politicians as \\"fascist\\". Additionally, the proposed introduction of ten-year employment terms for some new constables was met with considerable opposition. The bill was enacted in 1933 as the Metropolitan Police Act.Boyle 1962:pp. 630-636 Perhaps Trenchard's most well known achievement during his time as Commissioner was the establishment of the Police College at Hendon.Browne 1956:p. 346 Not long after his appointment, Trenchard decided that the recruitment and training methods of Metropolitan Police were not conducive to developing senior leaders from within the Force. He therefore envisaged a Metropolitan Police college that could help to produce such leaders by training the best selected from the ranks, as well as directly recruited educated men from school and university. Trenchard also wanted to create a new police rank of junior inspector to which Hendon's graduates would be promoted before later going on to the rank of Inspector. Although Trenchard's plans were criticized as a militarizing step, the Hendon College was opened in 1934.Boyle 1962:pp. 621-623, 637, 643 Today, the College principally provides initial training to police recruits as opposed to only those selected for advancement to the higher ranks.Hirschel and Wakefield 1995:pp. 85-87 In his final few months, Trenchard was made a knight grand cross of the Royal Victorian Order and in November 1935, Trenchard departed the Metropolitan Police, having wanted to relinquish his post the previous year.Boyle 1962: 685 He was succeeded by Air Vice-Marshal Sir Philip Game, whom Trenchard nominated as his preferred replacement.Boyle 1962:p. 666 Notes=References  Category:Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard category:History of the Metropolitan Police ","title":"Hugh Trenchard as Metropolitan Police Commissioner"},{"id":"24505964","text":"Spratt Memorial Stadium is a 7,500 seat stadium in St. Joseph, Missouri, United States, on the campus of Missouri Western State University.

Bohn saw the Socialist Labor Party as a failure, despite what he considered its basically-correct political orientation since 1900, because of the party's studied self-isolation and harsh treatment of newcomers: > It failed, first, because it attempted to sever the veteran revolutionary > element from the forces which were developing to that position. Nor is this > all. It strove to draw about itself the veil of absolute sanctity. It was > supposed by certain of its leaders to have attained what the Salvation Army > calls 'Holiness'; therefore it durst not hold conversation with the unclean; > therefore it refused to so far trust the working class' mind as to risk its > fundamentally correct principles in the rough and tumble of a united > movement.

Available online. Retrieved > September 29, 2009. Upon departing the SLP, Bohn enlisted himself in the ranks of the rival Socialist Party of America, a group which he acknowledged \\"is not what we might desire.\\" Nevertheless: > It would have been all that the clearest and most ardent revolutionist might > have hoped for, had the whole revolutionary element united to form it in > 1901 and learned to use decent and educational methods in propagating their > correct principles.

During the 1909/10 academic year Bohn was a lecturer in history, economics, and politics at Columbia University and the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences. The content of his lectures proved too radical for the Columbia administration, however, and he was not returned to the university.Socialist Lyceum Course, pg. 2. After leaving Columbia, Bohn went to work as State Organizer for the Socialist Party of New York. He was also named as an assistant editor on the International Socialist Review, published in Chicago by Charles H. Kerr & Co..Socialist Lyceum Course, pg. 2. Turn from the IWW Frank Bohn is best remembered as co-author with Big Bill Haywood of a frequently reissued pamphlet first published in 1911. The IWW atrophied to the point where it was unable to even hold a national convention in 1909, and its 1910 gathering in Chicago transacted no business of real importance.Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, pg. 220. Turnover was enormous in the organization. Vincent St. John noted in a letter to Paul Brissenden that the organization had issued 60,000 dues books in the previous 18-month period, but only about one in ten, or roughly 6,000 of these, remained members in good standing. In this October 1911 letter St. John claimed a total membership for the organization of 10,000 individuals in good standing.St. John to Brissenden, October 13, 1911, cited in Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, pg. 220. This stalling of the IWW's growth lead Bohn and others to the perspective that the organization suffered from a serious or even fatal sickness. Bohn contributed an article to the July 1911 issue of Charles H. Kerr's International Socialist Review entitled \\"Is the IWW to Grow?\\" in which he placed the blame for the organization's stagnation squarely upon the anti-political faction which had won control of the organization. He accused the IWW's mixed locals and propaganda locals of having driven away \\"real\\" industrial unionists from the organization, leaving those he disparagingly characterized as \\"hot-air social revolutionaries.\\"Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, pg. 220. He felt that the anti- political \\"fanatics\\" threatened the survival of the IWW: > The people we mean are those who make of anti-politics a fetish. They see in > the Socialist Party a number who are opposed to the IWW. 'Therefore,' say > these fanatics, 'as some of the Socialist Party members are against us, that > is sure proof that all of them are against us. The greatest enemy of the > working class are these advocates of unsound doctrine‚Äîof political action. > Let us destroy them. That will emancipate the working class.' The experience > of the five years just past has proven conclusively that the best way for > the members of the Socialist Party to develop anti-politics in the IWW is to > attack it. Likewise, the desertion of the party by IWW members, and their > opposition to it, has greatly strengthened the position of the reformist and > compromising wing of the party. Each of these groups has helped nurse the > other along.  The fanatic is a person who sees or think he sees but one > thing. Whether the thing he sees is there or not is of secondary importance. > The anti-politics fanatics in the IWW see the Socialist Party and nothing > else. What they think they see in the Socialist Party is usually expressed > in a vocabulary of vituperation. ... In hating the Socialist Party they > forget why they hate it. They forget industrial unionism. They forget the > class struggle.  The anti-politics agitation is not a movement. It > cannot develop an organization of its own. It is not industrial unionism. It > cannot be revolutionary because it is not positive. It is purely negative > and it ends in nothing. Is this chair-warming sect now the leading element > in the IWW? Is it in a majority? If it is, the IWW is not dying. It is > dead.Frank Bohn, \\"Is the IWW to Grow?\\" International Socialist Review, vol. > 12, no. 1 (July 1911), pp. 42‚Äì43. Later years U.S. entry into World War I against Germany and the Austro- Hungarian empire was a decisive turning-point for Bohn. In the fall of 1916, Bohn contributed to the Preparedness Movement by contributing articles to The New York Times condemning German militarism as a menace to world peace.See, for example: Frank Bohn, \\"No Progress Towards Democracy in Germany: Dr. Frank Bohn Says That Prussian Militarism Will Block Any Such Tendency Until It Has Been Definitely Crushed,\\" New York Times, November 19, 1916. Available online. Retrieved September 28, 2009. The staunch and unflinching anti-militarist line of the Socialist Party of America established at the party's 1917 St. Louis Convention put the organization at odds with Bohn's views. After keeping his criticism within party ranks for half a year, in the fall of 1917 Bohn decided to break decisively with the SPA, writing an open letter to the Secretary of Local Bronx, his own chapter. This letter, published in the New York Times on September 26, 1917, declared: > The position of the Socialist Party of New York, as voiced in the present > [electoral] campaign, makes it a plain matter of duty on my part to resign > my membership at once. The party is opposed to the conduct of war. I am > whole-heartedly supporting the cause of the Allies against Germany. It was > my hope that the party might not make the war a primary issue here or > throughout the nation; in that case I might have honorably retained my > membership. But the campaign here is to be waged directly and solely upon > the issue of the war. ... The social ideals I have had the privilege of > advancing among you are now more precious to me than ever before. But I am > positive in my belief that even a partial victory of German militarism would > institute militarism and the servile state throughout the world and thus > make an end of political democracy and of the great hope he have of > industrial democracy in our generation.\\"Bohn Leaves Socialists,\\" New York > Times, Sept. 26, 1917, op. cit. Following his departure from the Socialist Party, Bohn contributed to the war effort by writing a propaganda pamphlet for the American Alliance for Labor and Democracy, an effort of the Wilson administration to mobilize pro-war forces in the American labor movement in support of the European war effort.See: Frank Bohn, No Compromise with Germany. (1917). Thereafter Bohn went to work for the Committee on Public Information in France and Switzerland, aiding in the production of pro-war propaganda targeted to the labor movement.Christof Mauch, The Shadow War Against Hitler: The Covert Operations Of America's Wartime Secret Intelligence Service. New York: Columbia University Press, 2003; pg. 46. He joined the National Non-Partisan League and was a delegate to the 1st National Convention of the Labor Party of the United States in November 1919.A.S. Carm, \\"The Labor Party Convention,\\" The Weekly People, v. 22, no. 36 (December 6, 1919), pg. 1. Available online. Retrieved September 28, 2009. Bohn apparently worked as a journalist during the inter-war years. He also headed an organization called the German‚ÄìAmerican Congress for Democracy during the early years of World War II.Mauch, The Shadow War Against Hitler, pg. 45. Varian Fry writes in \\"Surrender on Demand\\" that Bohn helped him in Marseilles to aid refugees from Germany make it to America in 1940. In 1941 he wrote a report for the newly established Foreign Nationalities Branch of the State Department entitled \\"The German-American Population in the United States.\\" In this report Bohn warned against equating the 19th-century German immigrants, who were rapidly Americanized, with 20th- century newcomers, who were influenced by German nationalist propaganda and represented a potential pool of support for the Nazi enemy on American soil.Mauch, The Shadow War Against Hitler, pg. 45. Death and legacy Frank Bohn died July 29, 1975, at the age of 96. He is best remembered today as co-author with Big Bill Haywood of the influential pamphlet Industrial Socialism, a short work which helped fuel the American syndicalist boom of 1912‚Äì14.

It lies between the city of Wolfsburg and town of Gifhorn and consists of an enclosed woodland area of around with surrounding meadows and pastures. This low-lying depression lies partly within the territory of the city of Wolfsburg and partly within Gifhorn district. Together with the Dr√∂mling around 15 km to the east, the Barnbruch is the most valuable ecological lowland region along the upper course of the Aller.  Location  The Barnbruch is about 4 x 7 kilometres across and is bordered: *To the west by the Elbe Lateral Canal and the artificial lake of the Tankumsee (Isenb√ºttel) *To the north by the Aller and the villages of Oslo√ü and Weyhausen *To the east by the industrial facilities of the Wolfsburg Volkswagen factory *To the south by the K 114 district road (Wolfsburg-Gifhorn northern link) and the village of Calberlah  Drainage  The Aller Canal has drained the Barnbruch since 1863. Originally the Barnbruch was a carr (Bruchwald) or fen woodland. In 1830 it was the cause of complaint by the inhabitants of the neighbouring villages to their king. They said that, for years, they had not been able to harvest any hay and that their farms had been ruined by floods. Following a state treaty in 1860 between Prussia, the Kingdom of Hanover and Duchy of Brunswick over the regulation of the Aller and the Ohre, work began on draining the area. The main contribution to this effort was the Aller Canal, built 1860-63, between Wolfsburg and Gifhorn. Draining the land of water turned the swamps into a wetland with a rich variety of trees, in which both fen and riverside woods with birch, oak, ash and alder trees could flourish. Today large parts of the Barnbruch are nature reserves, in which several areas have been left to evolve without any human intervention.  Wood  Up to 1770 the swampy Bruchwald was not forested and pine trees only grew on a few higher points (sand dunes of ice age origin). The high levels of ground water and periodic flooding created alder groves which were largely inaccessible to people. In 1833 softwood trees, especially the alder accounted for 82% of the total area, whilst pines covered only 1%. In 1875, as a result of the drainage, this had fundamentally changed. Now alders on covered 42% of the land, whilst pine and birch now made up 51%.

The 775 residents live in one of three modern residential buildings, Habitat 67, Tropiques Nord and Profil-O. The rest is mostly put to light industrial use and constitutes the last functioning part of Montreal's 'Old Port', while modern port functions take place far further downstream in the north-east of the island.

History Cit√© du Havre is a modern concept, and constitutes what is effectively a modern development of the geography of Montreal.

He established many of the conventions of the craft, such as an outlandish sense of style (epitomized by his wearing of large clocks around his neck) and a vocal style that contrasted dramatically with that of the MC (his rasping high voice was a counterpoint to Chuck D's booming baritone).

It first aired on September 28, 2009. Plot On returning from rehab, House walks into Cuddy's office and quits. When he reports to Dr. Nolan, his psychiatrist, that his leg pain has returned, Nolan suggests that House take up a hobby that can channel his focus. House decides to learn how to cook. He joins Wilson in a cooking class. With House no longer in charge, Foreman wants to run the diagnostic department and Cuddy allows him a chance to do it. Foreman settles in House's office, and discusses Vince's case with Taub and Thirteen. Foreman plans to treat him for complex regional pain syndrome with a spinal stimulation. But Vince has looked up his symptoms on the Internet, and thinks he has mercury poisoning. Ignoring Foreman's orders, Thirteen and Taub perform the test for mercury and not the spinal stimulation. Despite Foreman saying his mercury test was negative, Vince demands treatment for the mercury but Foreman challenges him. As Taub and Thirteen administer the spinal stimulation, Vince's lungs begin filling with fluid. A thickened left ventricle in his heart is causing pulmonary edema. Taub suspects cocaine use. Foreman admits to Thirteen that he has been comparing himself to House. Taub and Thirteen go search Vince's office. As Taub and Thirteen play SavageScape at the developer's office, she complains that Foreman told her that he made a dinner reservation rather than asking her. Thirteen realizes that Vince, in researching the birds in the video game, may have caught an avian-related disease. Later, Thirteen discovers that Vince has had a three-hour erection. The doctors implant a stent for the priapism. Thirteen suggests a brain tumor but Foreman overrules her with a diagnosis of thrombocytosis. Taub agrees with Foreman. Thirteen and Foreman are arguing about the new dynamic in their relationship when they see unknown doctors in the patient's room. Cuddy visits House at Wilson's apartment. He is cooking with a Chinese classmate and they talk about Cuddy in Chinese. Cuddy wants to know if she is the reason that House left the hospital, and he tells her no. House later decides to give up cooking because his leg pain returns. He confides to Dr. Nolan that he's afraid of turning back to Vicodin. Later, House goes back to his apartment and finds a bottle of Vicodin that he had stashed away. Wilson later finds House feeling much better, which worries him. Wilson shares his concerns with Cuddy. He tells her that he had House's urine tested and it came back clean because it was from a dog. Wilson and Cuddy confront House. To prove he is clean, he urinates in their presence. Vince posts his symptoms on the internet. Doctors of highly different levels of skill come in to diagnose him. Before Foreman kicks them out, one doctor suggests a brain tumor. Thirteen tries to be diplomatic by saying that the diagnosis of both Foreman and the other doctor have merits. Foreman is angry that Thirteen did not completely back him up. Vince's MRI comes out clean, so Foreman orders Thirteen to treat for thrombocytosis. Thirteen complains to House, who has been expecting her to visit because he predicted that tensions would occur in her relationship with Foreman, now that he's in power. He tells her to give in to Foreman to save their relationship. Foreman apologizes to Thirteen and they make up. However, Vince's lymph nodes swell up. Foreman was wrong about thrombocytosis. Vince offers a $25,000 reward for an answer online. The team is swamped by suggestions sent in from the public. Vince decides to go with the majority diagnosis and demands to be tested for amyloidosis. Foreman makes a deal with him: Foreman will test for amyloidosis, but if the test result is negative then Vince must cease requesting help on the internet. Meanwhile, Taub quits, having received a recommendation from a friend to start a surgical practice. Foreman doesn't understand this move as he's holding up the diagnostics department so Taub and Thirteen can keep their jobs. Taub explains he came here to work because of House, not the department. Foreman is discouraged and turns to Thirteen for support. The test results show deposits in the renal endothelium consistent with amyloidosis. Vince hallucinates that he is in the world of the video game, and spikes a fever. Thirteen and Foreman discuss the diagnosis while Vince is in a cold tub. Thirteen wants to turn to the internet theories but Foreman thinks Vince has light-chain deposition disease (LCDD), which can be treated with chemotherapy. Later, Foreman takes a shower and notices his pruned fingers in the locker room. He rushes to stop the chemotherapy. Vince's fingers did not prune up after being in the bathtub for an hour. This is a symptom of Fabry disease. Thirteen also came to this conclusion based on iodine mumps, which came from an Internet suggestion. Thirteen comes to see Foreman in House's office. He is angry, but he needs her love and does not want their jobs to come between them. Because of this conflict, Foreman fires Thirteen. House shows up at Dr. Nolan's office with a check for $25,000--he was the one who had solved Vince's case online. House tells Nolan that when he began diagnosing cases, the pain in his leg stopped. Nolan thinks it is best for House to return to diagnostic medicine in order to save him from his addiction. Reception Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club graded the episode a B.

The Washington Post wrote: \\"Sahara, one of the most impressive film dramas ever screened at Moore's Rialto Theater, was acclaimed by large audiences at the first showings yesterday. Lavish in scenic embellishment ... Sahara features a most entertaining bill.\\" The Morning Telegraph of New York wrote: \\"It is a most elaborate production, in which are combined taste and lavish expenditure. The scenery -- both Miss Glaum's and that of the play, is unusually effective, the star's costumes being sufficient of themselves to repay women patrons. Moreover, the story holds interest unflaggingly, and a jewel like this in a setting of the sort here revealed makes for real value.\\" The New York Times offered the following comments: > \\"It is another Wild East melodrama.

Press notices in the East indicate that 'Sahara' is unquestionably one of the most luxurious motion pictures of the year.\\" It was also described as \\"a masterpiece\\" and a film \\"as brilliant and gorgeous as the colorful Egyptian desert.\\" A syndicated review published in several newspapers called it the \\"Biggest Picture of the Year\\" and praised it as one of the great dramas of recent years: > \\"All who see Louise Glaum in 'Sahara,' a powerful emotional drama of Paris > and Cairo by C.

Following some consultation with the local rugby union side, Jarrovians, Jarrow Junior Vikings became active at the under-12 age group. Soon after there was enough interest to form an adult section with a number of players coming forward from Westoe RFC and Student Rugby League set-ups in the North East the side were soon training and joined the North East Division of the Rugby League Conference for 2004. The club's reputation soon grew and their interaction in the wider community earned them the National title as Best New Club for 2004, for which they received an award from the Rugby Football League. In 2005, the Conference developed a new tier of Premier Divisions and Jarrow Vikings stepped up to the newly created North Premier Division. In 2006, they played in the North Division and a further 2007 reshuffle of the regional divisions saw Jarrow rejoin the North East Division. Jarrow won their first silverware in 2009 when they took the North East Division title. They beat Scottish champions Edinburgh Eagles and made it to the Regional Grand Final but were beaten by Northampton Casuals. Jarrow joined the newly formed North East Premier in 2011. Juniors Jarrow's junior teams take part in the North East Junior League.

He was released on parole from prison in 1985. He is the only person who has been released from prison after being convicted of murder in the killings committed by the Family. Biography Grogan, a musician and artist, dropped out of high school and was involved in minor crimes. When his frustrated parents lost hope, they decided to drop him off at Spahn Ranch. He was immediately taken in by the ranch hands and began to do odd jobs around the ranch. Ranch hand Donald Shea took a liking to Grogan, often buying him clothes. Grogan was a resident long before Charles Manson and the Family became associated with Spahn Ranch. Like Charles Manson, he was friends with Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys. He was often considered dumb, or even \\"retarded\\", by other Family members, earning him the nickname \\"Scramblehead\\", but some felt he was only \\"playing dumb\\". Allegedly, it was Grogan who wrecked Wilson's uninsured Ferrari.Steve Dennis Grogan profile, cielodrive.com; accessed March 17, 2017. In 1969, he was sentenced to 90 days observation at Camarillo State Mental Hospital for exposing his penis to a group of school children, but he returned to the ranch after two days. On the night of August 10, 1969, he rode with members of the Manson family. Tex Watson, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten were dropped off at the house of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca, but Grogan, Manson, Susan Atkins and Linda Kasabian continued to Venice Beach where Manson sent Grogan, Atkins and Kasabian to kill actor Saladin Nader, but Kasabian led them to the wrong apartment and the plan was aborted.Bugliosi, Vincent, with Curt Gentry, Helter Skelter ‚Äì The True Story of the Manson Murders 25th Anniversary Edition, pg. 312 and 390, W.W. Norton & Company, 1994; Grogan later helped Manson, Watson and Bruce M. Davis kill Spahn ranch hand Donald \\"Shorty\\" Shea. The jury returned verdicts of life imprisonment for Manson and Davis, but death for Grogan. However, on December 23, 1971, Judge James Kolts stated that \\"Grogan was too stupid and too hopped on drugs to decide anything on his own\\" and that it was really Manson \\"who decided who lived or died\\" and reduced Grogan's sentence to life imprisonment.Bugliosi, Vincent, with Curt Gentry, Helter Skelter ‚Äì The True Story of the Manson Murders 25th Anniversary Edition, pg. 466, W.W. Norton & Company, 1994; Grogan later assisted the authorities and drew a map to where Shea's body was buried. In prison he was head of the prison's program to deter juveniles from a life of crime and kept away from fellow inmate Manson. Grogan was released on parole from prison in 1985. On January 5, 1971, fellow Manson Family member Catherine \\"Gypsy\\" Share gave birth to a son while in jail awaiting trial; she later revealed that Grogan was the father. Grogan played guitar and sang in the Freedom Orchestra Band with fellow Manson family co-conspirator Bobby Beausoleil when they both served time at the Deuel Vocational Institute in Tracy, California. Beausoleil later revealed that he convinced Grogan to begin playing again and even made him a guitar.

The episode premiered on the Fox network on September 23, 2009, and was written and directed by executive producer Brad Falchuk. \\"Preggers\\" sees glee club member Kurt (Chris Colfer) join the football team and admit his homosexuality to his father, Burt (Mike O'Malley). Cheerleader Quinn (Dianna Agron) discovers she is pregnant and tells her boyfriend Finn (Cory Monteith) the baby is his, when in fact the father is his best friend Puck (Mark Salling). Faculty members Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) and Sandy Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky) team up in an effort to bring down the glee club, luring away a disillusioned Rachel (Lea Michele), who quits when club director Will (Matthew Morrison) refuses to award her a solo song. This episode features the first appearance of O'Malley as Burt Hummel. \\"Preggers\\" features covers of two songs, and several dance performances of Beyonc√© Knowles' \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\". A studio recording of Michele's cover of \\"Taking Chances\\" was released as a single, available for digital download and features on the album Glee: The Music, Volume 1. The scene in which Kurt comes out to his father was based on the personal experience of series creator Ryan Murphy. Murphy's intention was to move away from previous shows he has worked on in which gay characters have not been given happy endings, by allowing Kurt to succeed and be accepted. The episode was watched by 6.64 million United States viewers and received mixed reviews from critics. Shawna Malcom of the Los Angeles Times praised the show's fast pacing; however, The New York Times Mike Hale felt that key characters were not given enough screen time. The football team's performance of \\"Single Ladies\\" and Kurt's coming out to his father were generally well received; however, Rachel's actions garnered little sympathy, and several reviewers commented negatively on Quinn's pregnancy, with Eric Goldman of IGN deeming it \\"a very soap opera plotline\\". Plot Glee club member Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) is caught dancing to Beyonc√© Knowles's \\"Single Ladies\\" by his father Burt (Mike O'Malley), and claims that it is a football exercise, and that he is now part of the team. Fellow glee club member and football quarterback Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) helps Kurt to practice, and finds him to be a skilled kicker. Finn convinces coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher) to let Kurt try out for the team. Ken is delighted to find such an asset for the team and adds Kurt as the kicker. Finn's girlfriend Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) tells him she is pregnant, claiming her pregnancy as a result of Finn's premature ejaculation when they made out in Quinn's hot tub. Finn worries that his future prospects will be diminished by fatherhood. He asks glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) to coach the football team at dancing, believing it will help them to improve, increasing his chances of securing a football scholarship. Finn confides Quinn's news to his best friend Puck (Mark Salling), who later confronts Quinn, claiming to be the baby's father, since she said she was a virgin when they had sex. Quinn rejects Puck, calling him a \\"Lima loser\\" who could never support her and the baby like Finn. Will's wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) reveals to her sister Kendra (Jennifer Aspen) that she experienced a hysterical pregnancy and is not really carrying Will's baby. Kendra suggests that they acquire a baby, and when Terri learns of Quinn's pregnancy from Will, she confronts her, asking questions about her prenatal care. Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) approaches former glee club director Sandy Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky) and enlists him in her plan to sabotage the club. She blackmails Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) into appointing Sandy as the school's new Arts director, and together they hold auditions for a school production of Cabaret, hoping to entice away the glee club's star, Rachel Berry (Lea Michele). Rachel feels slighted when Will awards Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) a solo that she wanted, so she auditions for the musical and is given the lead role. When Will refuses to reassign the solo to Rachel, she quits the club. The football team puts their dance training into practice by performing the \\"Single Ladies\\" routine in the middle of a game, confusing and distracting the opposition, and with Kurt's help is able to win. Buoyed by his success, Kurt comes out to his father Burt and tells him that he's homosexual; Burt tells him he knew all along and loves Kurt just the same. Production Kurt Fuller (pictured) made a guest appearance in \\"Preggers\\" as local news station owner Mr. McClung. \\"Preggers\\" was written and directed by Glee executive producer and co-creator Brad Falchuk. Kurt Fuller guest stars as local news station owner Mr. McClung. The episode features covers of \\"Taking Chances\\" by Celine Dion and \\"Tonight\\" from West Side Story. Beyonc√© Knowles' \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" is also featured in several dance performances. Kurt's backup dancers for \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" are series regular Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) and recurring character Brittany (Heather Morris). Dancer Morris was one of Beyonce's backup dancers for \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" appearing on The Today Show, Ellen, and others. A studio recording of \\"Taking Chances\\" was released as a single, available for digital download, and appeared on the album Glee: The Music, Volume 1. The track charted at number 79 in Australia, 73 in Canada and 71 in the United States. The scene in which Kurt comes out to his father was taken verbatim from series creator Ryan Murphy's own life. Murphy felt that the scene was \\"a great thing to put on television\\", as, while audiences have seen gay characters isolated and attacked, they have rarely seen them ultimately winning and triumphing. He commented that: \\"The show is about making you feel good in the end. It's about happy endings and optimism and the power of your personal journey and making you feel that the weird thing about me is the great thing about me. I‚Äôve done other shows with gay characters, and I will say that in many of those cases, the gay characters didn't have a happy ending. And I thought you know what? Enough.\\" Colfer has commented that his biggest challenge was in ensuring the scene felt \\"honest\\" and not comical or \\"used as a punchline\\". He explained: \\"I think it's probably the first time a character's sexuality has been respected and almost dignified in a way, and I think that's really important, and there needs to be more of that on TV.\\" Reception Colfer's performance in Kurt's coming out scene was well received by critics. \\"Preggers\\" was watched by 6.64 million United States viewers and attained a 3.1/8 rating/share in the 18-49 demographic. It was the twenty-second most watched show in Canada for the week of broadcast, with 1.39 million viewers. In the UK, the episode was watched by 1.804 million viewers (1.397 million on E4, and 407,000 on timeshift), becoming the most-watched show on E4 and E4+1 for the week, and the most-watched show on cable for the week, as well as the most watched episode of the series at the time. The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Shawna Malcom for the Los Angeles Times reviewed the episode positively, praising the football team's performance of the \\"Single Ladies\\" dance and Kurt coming out to his father. Malcom also commented positively on the show's fast pacing; however, Mike Hale of the New York Post was less favorable, deeming the episode \\"overstuffed with story lines\\". He felt that key characters did not receive enough screentime, and that: \\"There was so much exposition going on that there didn‚Äôt seem to be much room for laughs.\\" Tim Stack for Entertainment Weekly wrote that, although the dancing in the episode was fun, \\"Preggers\\" was lacking in \\"big singing moments\\" apart from Rachel's performance of \\"Taking Chances\\". He deemed Quinn's pregnancy \\"a good dramatic twist\\", but hoped that it would not be a long-lasting storyline. Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode 8.8 out of 10. He called the \\"Single Ladies\\" performance \\"a memorable TV moment\\", and wrote that Quinn's pregnancy was a \\"very soap opera plotline\\" however commented: \\"luckily Glee is the kind of show to handle it with humor.\\" James Poniewozik for Time deemed Kurt's coming out \\"beautifully handled\\", commenting: \\"the fact that Dad (Mike O'Malley, who has turned out to be a pretty good character actor) ends up not being the boor we think he's going to be is one of the first signs that Glee is growing up as a series, that having established a world of primary-color stereotypes, it's now willing to subvert those expectations.\\" Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal criticized Rachel's actions in the episode, and felt that: \\"Rachel has become insufferable. The disagreements with Mr. Schue about her own development as a bona fide triple- threat have branded her as an overbearing prima donna to the rest of Glee.\\" The comedic pairing of Sue and Sandy attracted some praise, with Stack deeming them \\"the best villains ever\\". Goldman said that: \\"Tobolowsky is terrific in this role, as Sandy manages to make everything he says [...] sound amazingly disturbing.\\" Hale criticized Lynch as Sue, however, writing that she gave a \\"one-note performance\\", suggesting that she had been miscast in the role.

(c. 1790 ‚Äì 4 August 1851), was British Vice Consul to Mogadore (Essaouira), Morocco from 1814 until 1844, before being assigned to the Consularship of Adrianople (Edirne) in 1845, until his death in 1851. A native of London, he became an employee of English trading house James Renshaw and Co, and in early 1814 he was dispatched to Mogadore as that company's agent there.Riley, James; Evans, Gordon H (2001) Sufferings in Africa, Long Riders Guild Press, p.298, In the years thereafter he established himself as the foremost European merchant in the city, which was at that time an important trading port linking Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa to Europe and North America. Today Willshire is best remembered as the man who redeemed, cared for, and helped repatriate hundreds of Western sailors enslaved in the Sultanate of Morocco during the early part of the 19th century, including Captain James Riley, Robert Adams, and Captain Alexander Scott, all of whom would later write and publish harrowing accounts of their hardships endured as slaves in the desert. The town of Willshire in the US state of Ohio is named after him, in thanks, by James Riley. Early life and posting to Mogadore William Willshire was born in London in 1790 and spent his early life there.Riley; Evans, p. 288. Having gained employment with the London-based, English trading house James Renshaw and Co, he was despatched to Mogadore (Essaouira), Morocco as the company's agent in early 1814, partnering a successful mercantile establishment that was engaged in trading between Mogadore and Great Britain with the resident British Vice Consul and merchant Joseph Dupuis. Appointed Vice Consul When Dupuis returned to Britain in August 1814 he recommended Willshire to take over as British Vice Consul in Mogadore, a recommendation that was accepted by the Foreign Office in London.Riley; Evans, p. 298. After his appointment he remained the Vice Consul in the city and the agent of the American Consul General in Tangier for Mogadore too, (there being no Americans in the town to accept the duties of vice consul), until he left Mogadore in 1844.Maislish, David (2005), White Slave, Pen Press Publishers Ltd, p. 406, The redemption of Christian slaves Part of the British Vice Consul's duties at Mogadore involved the redemption of British nationals (usually sailors) from slavery under the terms of an Anglo/Moroccan treaty. To secure a redemption he employed as payment The Ironmongers' Fund, administered by The Worshipful Company of Ironmongers in London and set up by one of its members, Thomas Betton, in 1723, who himself had been enslaved in Barbary. Willshire was an intensely devout Anglican throughout his life and upon arriving in Mogadore and learning of the desperate hardships suffered by enslaved, mostly European and American Christian sailors who had been wrecked on the Saharan coast, he resolved to work tirelessly to secure the freedom of as many as he was able, regardless of nationality.Riley; Evans, p. 293. Barbary pirates took Europeans for ransom or slavery from passing ships or coastal towns as far north as Iceland. The first Barbary war attempted to stop the practice but this stoppage proved temporary but the second Barbary war finally stopped it. The US Marines hymn commemorates their involvement in the first Barbary war. Captain James Riley It was during one such redemption in 1815 that he first became aware of Captain James Riley. An American national, Riley's ship had been wrecked off the Western Sahara coast in August of that year and he and his crew enslaved. Willshire was approached by Riley's master Sidi Hamet with the purpose of ransoming Captain Riley and some of his crew. The Ransom was completed successfully with Riley and some of his crew delivered to Willshire. During Riley's convalescence at Willshire's house in Mogadore, the two became firm friends and later, business partners, forming a close relationship that lasted until Riley's death in 1840.Maislish, p. 393. Riley later went on to find fame with his published journal Sufferings in Africa, describing his experiences as a slave in the Moroccan Sahara. In thanks to William Willshire for the kindnesses he had received during his redemption and subsequent convalescence, Riley named his third son William Willshire Riley.Maislish, p. 387. When building a new town in Ohio, USA in 1822, Riley named it Willshire in his honour.Maislish, p. 389. The town today has 400 inhabitants.American Fact Finder , Retrieved 12 October 2009. Captain Alexander Scott Shortly after the redemption of Riley and his crew, he also redeemed another notable enslaved Westerner, Captain Alexander Scott, who had survived captivity for 6 years and who also wrote an account of his hardships for The New Monthly Magazine and Literary Journal in 1821.The New Monthly Magazine and Literary Journal, Vol I (1821), E Littell and R. Norris Henry, p679 Retrieved from Google Books 12 October 2009. Willshire was also recipient of many notes of thanks from organisations and individuals for his humanitarian work in Mogadore during his tenure as Vice Consul there, including in 1821 being elected honorary member of the Massachusetts Peace Society, receiving an award of $45 with the title.Pacificus, Philo (1821) The Friend of Peace, Vol II, Hillard and Metcalf, p.35 Retrieved from Google Books 12 October 2009. Life as a merchant in Mogadore The walled Moroccan port city of Mogadore (Essaouira), where William Willshire spent most of his adult life His position as Vice Consul in Mogadore never carried with it significant financial reward (between 1831 and 1845 his salary from the foreign office was just a ¬£100 a year),1825 ‚Äì British Consuls in Morocco in the Early Nineteenth Century Retrieved 12 October 2009. but during the 1820s and 30s as Willshire's business interests flourished, his social and professional influence in Mogadore increased, along with his personal fortune. Over time he began to play an important role in the various intrigues of the Moroccan elite and the foreign and Jewish merchants. For example, during the early 1830s he was conferred power of attorney in the long and complex bankruptcy dispute between the influential Moroccan based Anglo/Moroccan Jewish merchant house Macnin & Co and its several dozen London based creditors, in their attempt to recoup the company's ¬£21,729 debt from its Moroccan based assets.Schroeter, Daniel J (2002) The Sultan's Jew, Morocco and the Sephardi World, Stanford University Press, p.140 Retrieved from Google Books 15 October 2009. Upon the return of James Riley to Mogadore that same year, the pair struck up what was to be a highly lucrative business partnership, exporting goods to New York. Other activities that Willshire engaged in included drawing a sketch map of Southern Morocco for the Royal Geographical Society and writing a commentary on it in 1845.Biographies of Europeans in 18th and 19th Century Morocco, Retrieved 14 October 2009. Marriage and children By 1832 Willshire had married and had a young family, two sons Leonard and Alexander, a daughter Sara and two small girls.Maislish, p. 393. Audience with the Sultan In late 1839, Willshire along with his son Leonard and James Riley, were granted an audience with the Moroccan Sultan Mulay Abdir Ahman where he received the blessings of the monarch. It was at this time that Riley persuaded Willshire that he ought to think about returning to Christian lands. By 1840, with his fortune from his business interests amounting to some $200,000 he was ready to leave Mogadore and through James Riley he bought a home in New York at a cost of $16,000.Maislish, p. 405. But soon after this James Riley died at sea and Willshire abandoned his plan to move to America, his New York property being sold. Impoverishment and Consularship in Adrianople=The French attack Mogadore Mogador (Essaouira), 16 August 1844. Willshire instead remained in Mogadore and his business interests continued to flourish until an attack by the French fleet in 1844.Maislish, p. 397. As the most important foreigner in Mogadore it came to Willshire to negotiate with the Moroccan governor on the evacuation of foreign nationals out of the city and onto waiting British ships. Despite securing the safe evacuation of most of the foreigners out of the city, due to a dispute over unpaid import duties with the Moroccan Sultans' officials in the town, Willshire and a number of other European merchants and their families were prevented from leaving the town and joining the British evacuation ships. The Europeans were able to shelter safely in Willshire's warehouse whilst the French started their bombardment, but when the Sultans' officials and troops fled Mogadore under the attack, local Arab desert tribesmen seized the opportunity and plundered the town for two days and nights. During the ransacking, all of Willshire's fortune and goods were looted with Willshire and his family being manhandled and threatened in the process, his wife at one point having a scimitar held at her throat. The families were eventually rescued by a French boat and having been handed over to the British, the Willshire's arrived in London on 4 September 1844 utterly destitute, with no home, no business and no money. William Willshire was never able to return to Mogadore to reclaim his property. The subsequent consolatory stance towards the belligerents by the British government prevented Willshire from claiming any compensation from the French and Moroccan governments and Willshire was obliged to seek a new consular appointment. Consularship of Adrianople After initial refusals, the Foreign Office offered him the consulship of Adrianople (Edirne) following the previous consuls death. The Willshire family's time in Adrianople was one of misery, disease and poverty. On an initial salary of just ¬£60, despite frequent requests for a raise, it was only occasionally granted. Even after a miserable five years, his wife contracting typhus, his children with frequent fevers and Willshire himself having an operation on a cancerous growth, his constant requests for a transfer were always turned down flat. A typical response from Viscount Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston was simply \\"write larger and in a more upright hand\\".Maislish, p. 406. Desperate \\"to end my banishment from civilised society\\" he volunteered to retire and return to Britain, to live on his pension. The foreign office replied that his post did not entitle him to a pension, and that he could not be treated as a special case. Death Eventually the Foreign Office decided that it did make financial sense to close the consulate in Adrianople and use the money saved to pay Willshire on his return to Britain, a pension of ¬£100 a year. Palmerston proposed it and the Treasury agreed. They wrote to him on 18 August 1851 to let him know the good news. A response sent from Adrianople informed Palmerston that William Willshire had died on 4 August. An intensely religious man, during his lifetime William Willshire, despite receiving thanks from many quarters for his work in redeeming Western Christian sailors from a life of slavery, including a vote of thanks from the US Congress, didn't seek any accolades or recognition for his selfless and far reaching humanitarian work, but James Riley's son described him as \\"an honour to his nation and an ornament to mankind\\".Maislish, p. 407. Lincoln is quoted as saying that Riley's journal of his experiences in Africa, which might never have been written without Willshire's help to secure Riley's freedom, was one of the most important works in guiding his opinion on abolition in the United States.Maislish, p. 409.

The protest march was fueled by the indication of junta leader Captain Moussa Dadis Camara breaking his pledge to not run in the next presidential vote due in January 2010. The government had already banned any form of protests until 2 October, and when the demonstrators gathered in a large stadium, the security forces opened fire at them. At least 157 demonstrators were killed, 1,253 injured and 30, including Cellou Dalein Diallo, the leader of the opposition Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea (UDFG), were arrested and taken away in lorries. On the same day in 2018 six human rights organizations demanded justice to be done for perpetrators. The organizations were the Association of Victims, Parents and Friends of the September 28 Massacre (AVIPA), the Guinean Human Rights Organization (OGDH), the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch.Guinea: 9 Years Later, Bring Justice for September 28 Crimes Sidya Tour√©, former Prime Minister and now an opposition leader, was also injured in the shootings and spoke to the BBC secretly from a hospital's restroom. Opponents have accused the junta of limiting freedom of speech and violating human rights. Camara said that the troops responsible for the shooting spree were out of his control. Background Capt. Moussa Dadis Camara, leader of the junta. On 24 December 2008, about six hours after the death of Lansana Cont√©, a statement was read on state radio announcing a military coup d'√©tat by Captain Moussa Dadis Camara on behalf of a group called the National Council for Democracy and Development (CNDD), which said that \\"the government and the institutions of the Republic have been dissolved.\\" The statement also announced the suspension of the constitution \\"as well as political and union activity.\\" According to Captain Camara, the coup was necessary because of Guinea's \\"deep despair\\" amidst rampant poverty and corruption, and he said that the existing institutions were \\"incapable of resolving the crises which have been confronting the country.\\" Furthermore, Camara said that someone from the military would become President, while a civilian would be appointed as Prime Minister at the head of a new government that would be ethnically balanced. Initially when Camara took over power there was some support, the public being tired of Lansana Cont√©'s 24-year-long authoritarian rule. Camara promised a smooth transition of the country to democracy and a presidential election in which he would not stand. He gained much popularity by cracking down on drug dealers, including Ousmane Cont√©, son of the former President, and by making them admit wrongdoing on his television show. Later, Camara lost support because of his dictatorship-like rule and abusive behavior by him and his forces that indulged in violence, robberies and rapes. He himself humiliated several foreign ambassadors, politicians and leaders by telling them to \\"shut up or leave\\" from meetings. This had a negative impact on his image in public, and garnered him criticism for the erratic behavior. Protest The opponents had decided to stage a demonstration on 28 September against the likely participation of Camara in the next presidential election, and despite the government's ban on protests, they decided to carry on with their scheduled protest. A crowd of around 50,000 people gathered at the Stade du 28 Septembre on the day, carrying signs that read \\"Down with the army in power\\" and calling for an end of the \\"Dadis show\\". According to eyewitness accounts, the elite Presidential Guard, commonly known as the \\"Red Berets\\", came in trucks and threw tear gas on the crowd at first, but later opened fire. In the atmosphere of terror and panic, people started running, falling and getting hit. Youssouf Koumbassa, an eyewitness, claimed that the troops stripped down some female protesters. The equipment of a French journalist was seized and smashed. Protesters fled the stadium and poured into the streets, where they were pursued and fired on by troops. After the shooting incident, soldiers were seen publicly raping women, killing people, and looting stores. According to one eyewitness, soldiers asked people if they supported Camara, and those who did not were summarily executed, that some women were raped with guns, and shot dead, and that civilians were beaten and old men yanked by their beards.Al Jazeera English: Unrest over Guinea killings. (30 September 2009) The wounded were taken to hospital, where they were visited by human rights activists. Although many had gunshot wounds, some were found to have been severely beaten. The dead were taken to a mortuary, and soldiers stood guard outside. Relatives were called in to collect the dead. According to many victims' families, the military secretly disposed of over 100 bodies, as many had found that the bodies of their relatives had disappeared. Many witnesses reported seeing presidential guards loading some of the bodies into trucks. Images showing dozens of bodies lined up on the street were uncovered, and human rights groups used them as evidence to show that the death toll was much higher than government figures.Al Jazeera English: Guinea junta accused of cover-up. (21 October 2009) In the aftermath of the protests, hundreds of protesters who had taken part were arrested and imprisoned without charge. Government reaction Camara, in an interview to Radio France Internationale (RFI) said that the troops responsible for the killings were \\"uncontrollable elements in the military\\" and \\"Even I, as head of state in this very tense situation, cannot claim to be able to control those elements in the military\\". He also denied any responsibility for the killings, claiming that he did not issue any shooting orders, and was in his office. Camara has also denied knowledge of sexual assaults by soldiers. He later called for a UN investigation into the incident, an African mediator between the various Guinean political parties and a national unity government. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) dispatched President Blaise Compaor√© of Burkina Faso to act as a mediator. The proposal for national unity government was rejected by the opposition, calling it a tactic to divert attention from the massacre. On 7 October, Camara announced a 31-member commission, including 7 judges from the Justice Ministry, to investigate the details behind the incident. Camara claimed that it would be an independent inquiry. Death toll controversy Three days after the incident, the junta stuck to asserting a death toll of 56, while they were accused of secretly burying several bodies in the Alpha Yaya Diallo military camp. Both, Guinean Organisation for the Defence of Human Rights (OGDH) and African Assembly for the Defense of Human Rights (RADDHO) confirmed that it had received requests from families to look into the alleged clandestine burials performed by the military. The cold rooms at a hospital were opened for journalists on 1 October. Dr. Hassan Bah, the forensic expert who allowed the media into the morgues denied the occurrence of any secret burials by soldiers. International reactions The firing by security forces received international criticism. ‚Äì The Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Chile issued a statement, that \\"facing a wholesale slaughter of people for political reasons, atrocities and extreme violence, Chile demands from the authorities of Guinea immediate action leading to prosecution of perpetrators, the release of opposition leaders, the restoration of order and respect for civil and political rights so as to ensure a peaceful transition to democracy soon\\". ‚Äì France, in its statement initially condemned the violent nature of the protests by the opposition demonstrators, but later suspended its military ties with Guinea and called for a European Union (EU) meeting. ‚Äì The United States urged the junta government to \\"stand by its promise to hold free, fair, timely and transparent elections in which no member of the ruling junta will participate\\". The African Union was concerned about the \\"deteriorating situation\\" in the country, and indicated their intent to impose sanctions against Guinea if Camara ran in the next presidential elections. ‚Äì Javier Solana, the foreign policy chief of EU, called for the immediate release of arrested pro-democracy leaders and urged the government to \\"exercise maximum restraint and ensure a peaceful and democratic transition\\". On 21 October, the EU Council announced an arms embargo and sanctions against individuals in the junta. \\\\- The president of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, has called for an ECOWAS summit on this matter. On account of aggravation of political tension in Guinea due to this incident, FIFA decided to change the venue of the 2010 World Cup qualifier between Guinea and Burkina Faso, citing safety concerns. The game was played in Accra, Ghana instead of Conakry. International inquiries Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a report in December 2009 implicating several CNDD leaders in the massacre, and indicating that the events may constitute crimes against humanity.Human Rights Watch, \\"Guinea: Stadium Massacre, Rape Likely Crimes Against Humanity\\" Dec. 17, 2009 The United Nations released a 60-page report in 2009, describing the violence carried against protestors especially women. According to the U.N panel, 109 women and girls had been raped or sexually mutilated.The U.N Commission reached the same conclusion of the HRW by stating that it is \\" reasonable to conclude\\" that violence observed during the attack constitutes crimes against humanity. The report was also sent to the security council, The African Union, Guinea's government and ECOWAS. See also * Moussa Dadis Camara#Assassination attempt ReferencesExternal links *webGuin√©e - CNDD.

He initiated a series of long-lived enterprises, including the publishing house Det Norske Samlaget, the newspaper Dagbladet and the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights. Berner served as a liberal Member of Parliament, as Auditor General of Norway and as Burgomaster of Christiania. Background Berner was born in Sunndal in M√∏re og Romsdal county, Norway. He was the son of parish priest Ole Christian Berner and Laura Nicoline Collin. The family moved to Akershus in 1850. He married Selma Augusta Hovind in 1871. He was the brother-in-law of both industrialist Hans Mustad and Hans Gerhard Stub (1849‚Äì1931), Bishop of the Norwegian Lutheran Church in America. Hans G. Stub (Store norske leksikon) Career Berner graduated as a student in 1858, and as a jurist in 1863. In Christiania he befriended intellectuals such as Ernst Sars and Aasmund Olavsson Vinje, and became politically active and a supporter of the Nynorsk language. He co-founded the publishing house Det Norske Samlaget in 1868, and was its chairman until 1877. In 1868 he co-founded the newspaper Dagbladet, together with Danish-born author and literary figure, Anthon Bang (1809‚Äì1870). He was editor of Dagbladet from 1869 to 1879. The newspaper had close connections to the political movement that later came to be the Liberal Party of Norway. Anthon Bang (Store norske leksikon) His demand for a \\"clean\\" Norwegian flag, instead of the then-flag with a union badge (popularly known as Sildesalaten), led to political turbulence in 1879. The parliamentary majority voted for the removal of the union badge three times, but was defeated by royal veto twice. Finally, in 1898, the third royal veto was overruled and the union badge was removed from the national and the state flag. He was elected as a member of the Parliament of Norway in 1879, representing Akershus, and was re-elected in 1882 and 1885. Berner co-founded the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights in 1884, together with Gina Krog, and was the organization's first chairman. He was Auditor General of Norway from 1883 to 1898, and burgomaster of Kristiania from 1898 to 1912.

She wrote it with Lynn Vincent. The book became a New York Times #1 bestseller in its first week of release, and remained there for six weeks. It is one of four political memoirs published since the 1990s to sell more than two million copies. Writing process The book deal was announced in May 2009 when Palin was still Governor of Alaska. She said that she wanted the public to hear her true story, \\"unrestrained and unfiltered\\". She reportedly received an advance of $1.25 million from publisher Harper Collins, with two projected additional payouts of between $2.5 million and $5 million each. Palin announced that although she would have a ghostwriter to help, she would be doing a lot of the writing herself, employing her journalism skills and the personal diaries and notes that she had kept throughout her life. Critics questioned whether Palin could write a book. Responding to concerns that writing and promoting the book would interfere with her duties as governor, Palin said she would only work on the book after hours and would promote the book \\"schedule permitting\\". The Alaska law department issued a legal opinion which okayed the project, stating: \\"A book publication project is compatible with your position as governor so long as it does not interfere with your official duties\\". Conservative journalist and author Lynn Vincent worked on the book with Palin for several weeks shortly after she resigned the governorship in the summer of 2009. Palin met with HarperCollins editors for intensive editing sessions in New York City. HarperCollins publisher Jonathan Burnham said that Palin had been \\"unbelievably conscientious and hands-on at every stage\\", adding that the book was \\"her words, her life ... in full and fascinating detail\\". HarperCollins had planned publication for spring 2010, but later moved the date to November 17, 2009, as the book was completed earlier than expected. The publisher attributed completion of the memoir early to Palin's devoting full-time to the writing process after she left office. A paperback version of the book, with new material, released on August 24, 2010. Summary and themes The first part of the book is devoted to Palin's life before the 2008 campaign; the second part details her life as a candidate for national office. The book is written in a personal tone similar to Palin's manner of speaking. Palin discusses the disagreements she had with campaign advisers of her running mate John McCain, criticizes the national media, and talks about the importance of religion and family life.Palin did not include an index at the back of the book. Indexes are standard fare in political books because \\"in Washington the real-life characters included in such books appreciate the ability to quickly check the back to find out where they're mentioned\\". WebCite archive The \\"Going Rogue\\" part of the title refers to criticism leveled at Palin by McCain campaign advisers that she was straying from their carefully crafted message and publicly disagreeing with McCain on several issues. The subtitle, \\"An American Life\\", mirrors the title of President Ronald Reagan's 1990 autobiography. Palin ends the book by quoting her own father saying, \\"Sarah's not retreating, she's reloading.\\", suggesting she would return to public life. Commercial and critical reception The book was available for pre-order between $9 and $10 during a price war among online retailers Amazon, Target.com, and Walmart.com. Dan Calabrese, writing in the North Star National, called the sales \\"an absolutely unprecedented performance for a non-fiction book so far in advance of its release date\\". Less than two weeks after its release, sales of the book exceeded the one million mark, putting it in a class with memoirs by Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. The print run was extended to 2.8 million copies from 1.5 million. Going Rogue attained sales of over 2.7 million by December 1, 2009, and was number one on The New York Times Best Seller list for six consecutive weeks. As of January 21, 2010, it was #4 on the New York Times best seller list after 9 weeks in the Top 10. According to campaign records, late in 2009, Palin used $63,000 of donations from SarahPAC, her political action committee, to purchase copies of her book, \\"Going Rogue\\". The expenditures were listed as, \\"books for fundraising donor fulfillment\\". Meghan Stapleton, Palin's spokeswoman, stated the purchased books were autographed and awarded to donors contributing more than $100 to Palin's PAC. Analysis and reactions A team of eleven reporters for the Associated Press challenged some of Palin's statements as factually incorrect, such as her assertions that she traveled frugally, avoided large campaign donors, was against the Wall Street bailouts of 2008, and entered politics for purely altruistic reasons. Their analysis concluded by speculating that the book was \\"a pre-campaign manifesto\\". According to Fox News, an AP spokesman \\"confirmed 11 people worked on the story . . . but refused to say if similar number of journalists were assigned to review other political books, or if Palin has been treated differently\\".\\"AP Turns Heads for Devoting 11 Reporters to Palin Book 'Fact Check'\\" By Robert Shaffer FOXNews.com November 18, 2009. Retrieved 2010-12-16. Fox also reported \\"The (AP) organization did not review for accuracy recent books by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, then-Sen. Joe Biden, either book by Barack Obama released before he was president or autobiographies by Bill or Hillary Clinton.\\" Conservative talk show host John Ziegler objected to the AP piece, saying that the AP is extremely biased and \\"badly missing the most important points of Sarah Palin's book\\". The Huffington Post had an article titled \\"The First Ten Lies from Going Rogue\\", including the failure to credit ghostwriter Vincent on the cover, Palin's statement about legal bills she incurred relating to ethics complaints, without disclosing that most of the bills resulted from complaints she filed as a tactic in connection with Troopergate; and her assertion that she had to pay $50,000 in fees to be vetted by the McCain campaign. Palin replied: \\"as is expected, the AP and a number of subsequent media outlets are erroneously reporting the contents of the book\\". Former McCain campaign aides \\"hit back\\", according to Politico, \\"calling the former vice presidential nominee's soon-to-be released book 'revisionist and self serving' 'fiction'.\\" A representative for Katie Couric responded to the book's assertion that Couric had badgered Palin during their infamous 2008 interview by saying, \\"The interview speaks for itself\\". Reception The book received a variety of reviews. ;Positive reviews Conservative radio talk show host John Ziegler praised Going Rogue as \\"the best book and greatest literary achievement by a political figure in my lifetime\\" and as showing honesty \\"the type of which can only come from someone incredibly courageous, grounded, and self-aware\\". Republican radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh called the book \\"truly one of the more substantive policy books I've read\\". Stanley Fish, writing for The New York Times Opinionator blog, explained that \\"while I wouldn‚Äôt count myself a fan in the sense of being a supporter, I found [the book] compelling and very well done\\". ;Mixed reviews The Wall Street Journals Melanie Kirkpatrick described the book as \\"more a personal memoir than a political one\\", which demonstrated that Palin \\"is not the prejudiced, dim-witted ideologue of the popular liberal imagination\\". However, Kirkpatrick criticized the book as \\"too gentle\\" on the McCain campaign staffers and McCain himself, and as spending too little time discussing political issues. Critic Michiko Kakutani, writing for The New York Times, characterized Going Rogue as \\"part earnest autobiography, part payback hit job\\", noting that it was more critical of the McCain campaign than it was of Democrats. Kakutani credited the book with doing a \\"lively job of conveying the frontier feel of the 49th state\\". Matthew Continetti of The Washington Post observed that Palin's book was \\"everything you'd expect from a politician who has no intention of leaving the national scene\\". Entertainment Weekly gave the book a C, praising the first chapters about Palin's life as \\"down-to-earth and funny\\", while concluding that the rest of the memoir was mediocre and self-serving. ;Negative reviews Jack Kenny for John Birch Society subsidiary The New American criticized the book for being light on policy content: \\"Do I know any more about Sarah Palin‚Äôs political ambitions or core beliefs at the end of the book than I did at the beginning? Aside from a few vague hints of something deeper, the answer is 'no'.\\" Mark Kennedy of the Associated Press said the book was \\"less the revealing autobiography of a straight-shooting maverick and more a lengthy campaign speech ‚Äî more lipstick, less pit bull.\\" Like other reviewers, Kennedy felt \\"Palin reserves most of her attacks for McCain's advisers.\\" Michael Carey of the Anchorage Daily News said \\"there is a big something missing from Palin's narrative: the voice of a leader\\". The Huffington Post described the book as \\"one giant complaint about the conduct of John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign\\". Thomas Frank, writing for The Wall Street Journal, panned the book: \\"This is the memoir as prolonged, keening wail, larded with petty vindictiveness\\". Newsweek senior editor Michael Hirsh said that \\"she seems to be mainly out for repudiation of her critics here, and what you see is a lot of self-involvement\\" and that the book would \\"help her with her base...I don't know if it helps at all with what she would need to actually be elected president\\". Book tour Palin was interviewed in rapid succession by Oprah Winfrey, Barbara Walters, Sean Hannity, and Bill O'Reilly, with the US News speculating that the interviews and book tour would be \\"strewn with land mines\\". Palin began a three-week national book tour that focused on small and mid-size towns; 11 of the states she visited were considered political battle- grounds for U.S. presidential election, 2012. Large crowds turned out to greet Palin and get their books autographed. Palin spent as long as three hours at some venues. ABC News characterized her bus book tour as \\"extraordinarily successful\\" but suggested she might be criticized for taking a private jet provided by the publisher for long legs of the journey. In addition to the book tour, a web-based campaign directed ads for the book to people searching for Palin's name on Google. Palin also used her Facebook page (accessible to non-subscribers) to promote her book. Parodies Going Rogue has inspired a number of parodies and satirical interpretations. Roy Edroso of the Village Voice \\"reviewed\\" the book by writing fake excerpts. TA Frank of The Guardian similarly parodied the contents with a faux first draft, complete with fake notes between Palin and her editors. WebCite archive Cartoonist Julie Sigwart and radio host Michael Stinson released a 48-page spoof Going Rouge: The Sarah Palin Rogue Coloring & Activity Book, on the same day that Palin's Going Rogue appeared on the shelves. South Park featured a parody of the book called, Going Rogue on the Smurfs. The website http://goingrogueindex.com leads to a proper-name index for Going Rogue (which was published without one) WebCite archive that features satirical trappings, such as a photo collage of several historical figures quoted in the book, and an embedded German song that translates to \\"Madonna in Hell\\". The book Going Rouge: Sarah Palin, An American Nightmare, was a collection of essays compiled by The Nation criticizing Palin. The cover image was a parody of Palin's book, and was nearly identical. This resulted in news sources, including CNN and Fox News, confusing The Nation's book with Palin's. References in popular culture The book and its surrounding promotion have been mentioned on late night comedy shows, including Late Show with David Letterman and Jimmy Kimmel Live! David Letterman had a recurring segment, \\"Things More Enjoyable than Reading the Sarah Palin Memoir\\", including such things as \\"getting run over by a lawnmower\\" and \\"driving into a tree\\". On December 11, 2009, William Shatner read excerpts from the book on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien followed by Palin reading excerpts from Shatner's autobiography, Up Till Now. Additional works Palin published a second book, America by Heart: Reflections on Family, Faith, and Flag, in November 2010.

The single example flew with Air Afrique on French colonial routes. Design and development In 1936 the well-established Potez company became part of the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Constructions A√©ronautique du Nord (S.N.C.A.N.), under the Law for the Nationalisation of Military Industries. In 1937 they produced their first four-engined aircraft, the Type 661. This was a commercial machine with seating for up to twelve passengers. It was a low wing cantilever, almost all- metal monoplane. The wing tapered with a nearly straight trailing edge that carried outboard balanced ailerons and split trailing edge flaps over the whole of the centre section. The four 220 hp (164 kW) Renault 6Q inverted inline engines were conventionally mounted of the front wing spar and drove variable-pitch twin-bladed propellers. The fuselage was a metal monocoque, with a port side passenger door aft of six windows on each side, one per seat. Though the standard seat arrangement was for twelve, two seats could be removed to allow the installation of chaises-longues for longer flights. The pilots' cabin was enclosed, with side by side dual control seating. The tail unit carried twin vertical endplate fins, slightly oval on a tailplane that had strong dihedral. The balanced rudders and elevators were metal structures with the only fabric covering used on the aircraft. The elevators carried trim tabs. There was a small tailwheel, the main undercarriage retracting into the inner engine nacelles. Operational history The first flight was on 18 July 1937.AviaFrance: Potez 661 By August 1938 the 661 had completed its Air Ministry testsFlight 11 August 1938 p.128 and by April 1939 its 100 hr \\"endurance\\" tests. In mid-April it was handed over to Air Afrique and had made its first flightFlight 24 April 1939 p.436 on the trans-Africa route from Dakar to Pointe Noire. Though only one was built before the war, it gained the reputation of being an economical transport.Flight 30 September 1943 p.436 There were suggestions, in war-time England at least that the Potez 661 or its more powerful development the Potez 662 might be built in occupied France for German use, but there is no evidence that any more were produced. Variants ;Potez 661: The initial prototype powered by 4x Renault 6Q-02 air-cooled inverted in-line engines ;Potez 662: A second prototype powered by 4x Gnome & Rh√¥ne 14M-5 radial engines, with equal tapered outer wings to allow for changes in the centre of gravity with the heavier radial engines.

It was built between 1891 and 1893 for the Ashton Syndicate by Sydney Stott of Oldham. Rock Mill was built on the site of Wilshaw Mill retaining and using the octagonal chimney. It ceased spinning cotton in the 1960s and was demolished in 1971; the site became the location for the town's first Asda supermarket, which opened in 1972, until Asda relocated to a much larger new store site in Cavendish Street in 1989. Location Rock mill was built on the site of the former Wilshaw Mill, on the junction of Oldham Road and Wilshaw Lane. This had been an unusual site for a mill as it was not close to railways or canals. The water needed to supply the steam engine came from a reservoir formed by damming the Smallshaw Brook. The reservoir was enlarged when the new mill was built History The Minerva Spinning Company Limited was registered in 1891 to build the Minerva Mill at Whitelands. The directors were Messrs Barlow, Marland, Coop, Newton, Pollitt and Pownall; they were later referred to as the Ashton syndicate. In April 1891, the syndicate registered the Rock Mill Spinning Company Ltd to build the Rock Mill. It was built with a capital of 60,000 GBP. The syndicate went on to build Atlas Mill, Curzon Mill, Tudor Mill, Cedar Mill and finally the Texas Mill. Construction was slow, it was not completed until August 1893. Even then only a third of its 66,000 spindles were working. The cotton industry peaked in 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The great war of 1914‚Äì1918 halted the supply of raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. In the 1920s Rock Mill joined the Atlas Mills Ltd. group, but the independent mills were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Atlas Mills Limited was taken over by the LCC in 1929. Thus, Rock Mill was one of 104 mills brought into LCC ownership, and one of the 53 mills that survived through to 1950, where it produced 30 and 40 count mule twist. It closed in the 1960s and was used as a warehouse. It was demolished in 1971 to make way for Ashton's first Asda supermarket. Architecture This was a Sydney Stott building. It was four storeys high built on a basement. It was 21 bays long (65 m), and 40 m wide with a water tower on the long side. The chimney was octagonal as it also used by the previous mill. Power The steam engine was a 1250 hp triple expansion four cylinder by George Saxon & Co, of Openshaw built in 1892. The twin low pressure cylinders had a diameter of 40in, the intermediate was 36in and the high pressure was 22in. It had a 6 ft stroke. All cylinders had Corliss valves. They drove a 16 ft geared flywheel that geared up, 120 teeth onto 54. The air pumps were driven by crossheads. The boilers were made by Fernihough and Son of Dukinfield and operated at 160psi. Usage Rock Mill was used for spinning finer counts of Egyptian cotton, for twists. By 1911 it was spinning both Egyptian and American, and in 1951 it was spinning 30s and 40s.

Statement of the diamond theorem  field diagram of the diamond theorem Let K be a Hilbertian field and L a separable extension of K. Assume there exist two Galois extensions N and M of K such that L is contained in the compositum NM, but is contained in neither N nor M. Then L is Hilbertian. The name of the theorem comes from the pictured diagram of fields, and was coined by Jarden.  Some corollaries = Weissauer's theorem  This theorem was firstly proved using non-standard methods by Weissauer. It was reproved by Fried using standard methods. The latter proof led Haran to his diamond theorem. ;Weissauer's theorem Let K be a Hilbertian field, N a Galois extension of K, and L a finite proper extension of N. Then L is Hilbertian. ;Proof using the diamond theorem If L is finite over K, it is Hilbertian; hence we assume that L/K is infinite. Let x be a primitive element for L/N, i.e., L = N(x). Let M be the Galois closure of K(x). Then all the assumptions of the diamond theorem are satisfied, hence L is Hilbertian.  Haran-Jarden condition  Another, preceding to the diamond theorem, sufficient permanence condition was given by Haran-Jarden: Theorem. Let K be a Hilbertian field and N, M two Galois extensions of K. Assume that neither contains the other. Then their compositum NM is Hilbertian. This theorem has a very nice consequence: Since the field of rational numbers, Q is Hilbertian (Hilbert's irreducibility theorem), we get that the algebraic closure of Q is not the compositum of two proper Galois extensions.

Its country is mostly in Leicestershire, together with some smaller areas of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. Despite the abolition of fox hunting intended by the Hunting Act 2004, the Quorn continues to go out on four days of the week during the autumn and winter months. History The hunt traces its origins to a pack of foxhounds established in 1696 at Tooley Park, Leicestershire, by the youthful Thomas Boothby (1677‚Äì1752). Its present name comes from the village of Quorn, also known as Quorndon, where the hounds were kennelled between 1753 and 1904.About the Hunt page at quornhunt.co.uk They were established there by the hunt's second master, Hugo Meynell, who bought Quorndon Hall from the 4th Earl Ferrers.William C. A. Blew, The Quorn Hunt and Its Masters (1899), p. 23 Following more than half a century under the leadership of Boothby, Meynell was Master for forty-seven years. He was known for his innovative mastery of fox hunting so that he has been called 'The Primate of the Science'.Blew, op. cit., p. 47 In 1905, new kennels and stables were built at Paudy Lane, Seagrave; these are now listed buildings.Quorn Hunt Kennels and Stabling, Quorn Park, Seagrave (Grade II) at charnwood.gov.uk The hunt's present-day kennels are at Gaddesby Lane, Kirby Bellars, near Melton Mowbray.Quorn Hunt Kennels at yell.com George Osbaldeston, Master 1817‚Äì1821 and 1823‚Äì1827 Among many notable Masters was George Osbaldeston, who in 1823 became the first to return to the Mastership after having previously retired.Blew, op. cit., Chapter IV at archive.org: 'Mr George Osbaldeston 1817‚Äì1821, 1823‚Äì1827' Before gaining its present title in the mid-19th century, the hunt was often known by the name of its Master: for instance, from 1827 to 1831 it was called 'Lord Southampton's Hounds'. Until 1884, the hounds were owned by the Master, and a change of mastership took place either by purchase or inheritance.Blew, op. cit., passim The hounds are now said to be \\"owned by the country\\", that is, by the hunt organization.Quorn Hunt at mfha.org.uk In 1890, Algernon Burnaby and Count Eliot Zborowski together planned the Quorn Hunt's famous Midnight Steeplechase, a jumping race in the middle of the night over twelve furlongs, with the riders dressed in nightshirts and top hats and the fences lit by oil lamps. Burnaby was the triumphant winner, gaining a silver cup provided by Zborowski. The race is commemorated in sporting prints.William Arthur Deakin, 19th century Loughborough: a review of the past century (Loughborough: Echo Press Ltd, 1974), p. 74 A Great Depression began in 1929, and subscriptions to the hunt began to fall.

On the eastern side of the country lies a rolling open landscape, with good fences to jump, while to the west are the wooded uplands of Charnwood Forest and the Pennine Chain. The best centres are around Melton Mowbray, Leicester and Loughborough. In 1853, the southern part of its country was separated off to form the Fernie. The adjoining hunts are the Meynell and South Staffs (to the north west), the South Notts (to the north), the Belvoir (to the north east), the Cottesmore (to the south east), the Fernie (to the south), and the Atherstone (to the south west). Season and supporters Hunting takes place on Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays, in the autumn and winter months only. More open country is hunted on Mondays and Fridays, the most popular days, with usually between one hundred and one hundred and fifty mounted followers, plus about twice as many who follow hounds on foot and with cars and bicycles. The smallest number of followers is on Tuesdays. Over eight hundred farmers in the country of the Quorn allow the hunt to use their land.

Amman, the capital of Jordan, is to the east. In addition, the Israeli settlement of Ateret is nearby. Masri envisages the latter as becoming a suburb of Rawabi in the future.Lyse Doucet and Jane McMullen, 'The new Palestinian city that lacks only one thing,' BBC News 7 February 2015. The construction site stretches over two ridges, above sea level.Building the Palestinian Dream on shaky ground. Haaretz On a clear day, it is possible to see the Mediterranean Sea, to the west, and the Israeli coastal city of Tel Aviv from the site. Rawabi's municipal boundaries will encompass 6,300,000 square meters of land. Residential and commercial development is based on a population estimate of 40,000. Financing One problem was that the West Bank lacked a traditional mortgage system. To that end, the development was linked to a $500m affordable mortgage scheme. The Washington Post reports that Rawabi \\"is specifically designed for upwardly mobile families of a sort that in the United States might gravitate to places such as Reston, VA. The developments are also relying on another American import, the home mortgage, including creation of a Fannie Mae-style institution for the West Bank\\". Rawabi is the largest private sector project in Palestinian history.A Shining City on a Hill. TIME, 31 March 2011Building peace. CTV Television, 29 August 2010 It was initiated at the Palestine Investment Conference, which took place in Bethlehem in 2008.Construction begins on Rawabi, the first Palestinian planned city. AMEinfo.com, 5 January 2010 The project involves a public-private partnership between Masri's property investment firm, Bayti (My home) Real Estate Investment Company, and his primary corporation, Masser International, which provided a third of the billion dollar investment, together with financial backing from Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Company (the Qatar Investment Authority's property investment fund), Massar International, and the Palestinian National Authority. U.S. Trade and Development Agency Director Leocadia Zak meets an architect at the Rawabi site with Bashar Masri The total cost of the development, mostly funded by the Qatari company LDR and Masri, a native of NablusElhanan Miller, 'In Rawabi, the brand-new Palestinian city, both sides win,' The Times of Israel February 19, 2014 and Palestinian multimillionaire, is estimated at US$850 million. As of June 2015, the total investment in Rawabi is US$1.2 billion. Masri sees the development as an integral part of a nation-building project, the construction of a future Palestinian state. He himself recalls that when he was a boy in Nablus, merely carrying a Palestinian flag on the streets was sufficient to get one shot by Israeli soldiers. To complete the project, it was calculated that 8,000 and 10,000 new jobs would be created in the Palestinian construction sector. The Palestinian Authority is responsible for providing off-site infrastructure, while Bayti is tasked with the design and development of the city. According to The Rawabi economic growth strategy, from 3,000 to 5,000 new jobs in \\"knowledge economy\\" industries including information technology, pharmaceuticals and health care would result from its development. On 15 March 2010, two grant agreements were signed by Bashar Masri, Managing Director of Bayti Real Estate Investment Company and chairman of Massar International, and Leocadia I. Zak, Director of the United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), in the presence of US Consul General Daniel Rubinstein. The USTDA grants funded two feasibility studies. The first study to develop a master plan for Rawabi's ICT infrastructure and services was won by American management consultancy company Decision/Analysis Partners LLC of Fairfax, Virginia. The second study examined the possibility of building a tertiary waste water treatment facility for Rawabi and surrounding communities. Previously, United States Senator John Kerry visited the construction site on 28 February along with Rubenstein and David Harden, senior advisor to the American special envoy to the Middle East, George J. Mitchell. In 2009 the Palestinian Authority undertook to provide $150 million to cover infrastructural costs for power, water, sewerage, schools and roads, but failed to honour its promise. As a result, purchasers must pick up the tab, which translates into a rise of 10 to 12 percent to the cost of houses. The development faced a financial crunch in 2014 due to a cash flow crisis when Masri was unable to collect $70 million from homeowners and mortgage banks for the first batch of 600 apartments, because they cannot be delivered until the access road, and a water supply, are given Israeli permits. Master plan The Palestinian National Authority did not need Israeli approval for construction since the land for Rawabi falls entirely within Area 'A', which is under full Palestinian control.Building Rawabi. Jerusalem Post, 3 August 2010 The Rawabi master plan and Preliminary Design was developed by a Multi- disciplinary team from AECOM led by Raphael Samachhttp://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2010/0514/Architect-eyes- tony-Palestinian-city-with-eco-mindset-and-fast-InternetScott Lewis, 'First Palestinian Planned City Taking Shape,' Enr.com.8/3/2011. (now with SAMACH+SEO), in cooperation with local experts from Birzeit and An-Najah National universities and the technical teams of Bayti. It has been approved by the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Higher Planning Council. Constructing the city has created jobs for 8-10,000 Palestinians, a third of them women, and their pay is 30% above the Palestinian minimum wage. The residential areas will surround a city centre that includes banks, shops, petrol stations, offices, eight schools, playgrounds, walking trails, two mosques, a Greek Orthodox church, a hospital, hotel, a seven-screen cinema and numerous other arts venues, in a central piazza lined with arcades and cafes. One third of the engineers and architects are women, a gender participation without precedent in the Arab world. The design envisages an elaborate recycling infrastructure: water towers are not included in buildings, neither are satellite dishes permitted. Water is to be recycled by a computerized system, and any excess will provide watering for the city's parks. The public transport system is to run on electricity, providing free transit to residents, with visitors only being required to pay. Though an industrial zone is planned, with paved roads already leading to the site, permission has yet to be received from the Israeli authorities. A soccer field, and Roman amphitheatre girded by honey-coloured columns, and seating 12,000, has been completed.Isabel Kershner, Palestinian Town in West Bank Awaits Israel‚Äôs Approval for Water,' New York Times Retrieved 26 August 2014. The first 700 units were offered for sale in June 2013, with prices ranging from $60,000 to $170,000, 90% of which were sold, according to the developer, within a month. Of the initial purchasers of homes in Rawabi by 2013, 7% were single professional women and 11% were Palestinian Christians. Lisa Goldman, director of the Israel-Palestine Initiative at New America, argues that the project draw attention from the ongoing issues of military occupation, and notes that the home-buyers are middle-class couples earning 20 times more than the average Palestinian income. Greening project Thousands of saplings are being planted as part of a greening project which involves growing a forest around the city. The Jewish National Fund is donating 3,000 saplings to the project, the announcement of which sparked some internal Israeli and Jewish controversy. Saplings have also been donated by the Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture and by local and international organisations, corporations and individuals.  Rawabi Tech Hub  In 2017, a \\"tech hub\\" opened in Rawabi City. According to the Rawabi City website, \\"Rawabi's Tech Hub hopes to catalyze and sustain growth in the Palestinian ICT sector with four major initiatives: (1) Attracting local and international ICT companies to establish operations at Rawabi; (2) Establishing the Rawabi Institute for Training and Advancement (RITA): a market-driven, technology-focused training institute; (3) CONNECT, a collaborative workspace for ICT entrepreneurs; (4) BADER, a private equity fund providing venture capital to ICT startups.\\" As of February 2018, four companies were working at the CONNECT collaborative workspace: WebTeb, an Arabic version of WebMD; Imagry, a developer of automated driving software; Studio 83, a provider of 3D visualization for real estate companies; and an employee of GETAWAY, a German car-sharing startup. Access roads Though he obtained Israeli assurances in 2007 that a permit would be granted for a large access road capable of allowing 100 trucks to access the designated construction site weekly, and to cope with the volume of cars expected to be used by its prospective 40,000 residents,Kate Shuttleworth, 'A Self-Contained City Inside A Conflict Zone: Millionaire American-Palestinian Investor Plans High-End, High-Tech Development In West Bank,' IB Times 6 December 2013. it took several years for a permit to be granted, for a much smaller, scaled-back primary access road to transport in building materials. Only in January 2012 was a single access road for trucks approved by Israeli authorities,A new Palestinian city rises in the West Bank. CTV News, 5 February 2012 shortly before a visit by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.ABC News, 2 February 2012 The access road for inhabitants still needs to be approved. It needs to pass through Area 'C'West Bank: Build it and they will come. Jerusalem Post, 4 November 2011 and cross Route 465, used mainly by inhabitants of nearby Israeli settlements Ateret and Halamish and Palestinian inhabitants of Birzeit. At the beginning of 2013 a new stretch of road linking 465 road with Ramalla was approved, intended for Palestinian traffic only. As of June 2015, Israel has yet to provide permits for widening the only road to Rawabi as well for other access roads to Nablus and Ramalla. Land purchase and water supply The first 600 apartments were sold out by 2013, and were due to be handed over to their Palestinian owners in the spring of 2014. At this point, Israel demanded that the Palestinians meet with the Joint Water Committee to approve the Rawabi project, which the Palestinians were unwilling to do, because they would have been forced to rubber-stamp water projects to settlements. Israel provided water to settlements in spite of this, but refused to do so for Rawabi, preventing new buyers from moving in. Water has repeatedly proved a contentious issue in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The 600,000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank are serviced with 6 times the quantity of water allocated to the area's 2.7 million Palestinians. A resolution of the issue was promised by August 2014, but Israel did not come through with the requested permit. As a result, the financial viability of the development project came under threat. Permits from Israel to allow the construction of an access road into the city were also lacking until February 2015. Political infighting, with wrangling over whether or not, it was necessary to convene a joint Palestinian-Israeli commission to authorize the final linkage to water, became a key sticking-point. For some years Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya‚Äôalon placed as a condition for connecting the city to the Mekorot company, that the Israeli-Palestinian Joint Water Committee be convened to issue permits, not only to Rawabi but also to Israeli settlements, a proposal opposed by the Palestinian Authority, which has refused to convene the Committee since 2010 to avoid supplying Palestinian legitimisation of Israel's settlements in the West Bank. Such delays do not occur with Jewish settlement, since Mekorot connects any legal Jewish home in the West Bank to its water mains. Tony Blair, head of the Quartet on the Middle East, who, together with Barack Obama has raised the issue of Israel's failure to supply Rawabi with water connections, has sided with the Palestinians this issue, stating that they have reason to refuse to supply settlements with water in so far as settlements are a key plank in peace negotiations.Ya'alon relented in early 2015 and approved connecting the city up to Mekorot. The decision was confirmed by Major General Yoav Mordechai, coordinator of Israeli government activities in the Palestinian territories, but the link was further delayed when the Minister of National Infrastructure, Energy and Water, Silvan Shalom, the subject of a fierce letter-writing campaign from Israel's far-right settler lobby,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/new-palestinian-city- has-condos-a-mall-and-a-sports-club--but-no- water/2015/02/24/d5a28dcc-b92e-11e4-a200-c008a01a6692_story.html postponed the decision, insisting that due authorization was required from the Joint Israeli-Palestinian Water Committee. In the West Bank, the Defence Minister exercises authority over the pipeline, while the water minister is in charge of the water, and Mekerot would not supply the water unless the Minister for infrastructure authorizes the Water Authority to give the go-ahead. According to both Weissglass and Shlomo Eldar such prior joint committee approval has not been necessary in setting up water connections for Israeli settlements in these territories, though Shalom's Ministry insists that this is a provision set forth in the Oslo Accords. A Haaretz editorial described the refusal to link up the city to water as a form of punishment to achieve diplomatic ends. Even Israeli President Reuben Rivling urged Israel to give water to Rawabi. The deadlock was broken on 26 February when Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu overruled objections and gave the go ahead for linkage.Smadar Peri, 'Battle for water won by entrepeneur [sic] of first Palestinian planned city,' Ynet 4 March 2015 Masri hailed the decision, commenting: \\"Now we have our universal right of our water without being pressured for any concessions.\\" The city now has a state of the art water grid - eventually serviced also by a huge water reservoir roughly half a kilometre outside the city - which is linked to a 2.4-km pipe through areas A and B under Palestinian civil administration. Israel has still to provide permission for the final link to the Israeli water company Mekorot's plant in Umm Safa, 1.1 kilometres across Area C, which is under Israeli military administration. Technically, all new water infrastructure in the West Bank requiring pipes larger than 5 cm requires the approval of the Joint Israeli-Palestinian Water Committee. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was also reported to favour connecting the city to the watergrid. As of June 2016, 250 Palestinian families have taken up residence in Rawabi. Difficulties persist since the pipeline supplies only 300 cubic meters of water per diem, which is below the necessities of the residents and the demands for further construction.Mohammed Daraghmeh, 'Palestinians begin moving into West Bank's first planned city after years of setbacks,' Haaretz 14 June 2016.  The right to purchase  Asked whether Jews could purchase apartments in Rawabi, al-Masri home-buyers must get permission from the Palestinian Authority, a procedure that can take up to six months. He has no complaint about this because it is designed, he added, to avoid the possibility that \\"bad Israelis\\" might buy properties and fly the Israeli flag at their windows. Many Israeli-Arabs have purchased apartments as an investment or for leisure purposes. Controversies Construction of Rawabi. Industrial area and some of the neighbourhoods. View from Ateret. William Booth, a writer and bureau chief for the Washington Post, has stated that > Rawabi is the counternarrative in the forever conflict in which Palestinians > are often portrayed as terrorist or victim, living in refugee camps or dusty > villages out of biblical times. Masri has been attacked by both sides for undertaking his development. Some Palestinians protest that his approach is \\"normalizing\\" Israel's occupation of the West Bank. In 2010, Israeli settlers held demonstrations to protest the project, although they acknowledged that they could not prevent the city's construction. Some settlers said they would establish settlements nearby. Masri has repudiated offers of building supplies from settlements, and ignored Israel suggestions as to how Rawabi should be modelled. He has gone on the record as stating > Settlers are evil people in general that continue to harass our people; they > continue to live on our land illegally, and it‚Äôs recognized by almost the > whole world as being illegal. We do not deal with illegal bodies or illegal > issues. He has made it a requirement that all contractors working on the project \\"sign an agreement refusing to use Israeli products originating from the settlements or work in the settlements themselves\\". Some Palestinians criticize the development as one that creates the impression that they can enjoy economic prosperity while the Israeli occupation continues. Yousef Munayyer has stated that,\\"(t)he project creates this illusion that there is this happy space in Palestine that is independent of the military occupation which governs many aspects of Palestinian life.\\" In reply, Masri argues that it is a symbol that defies the occupation, secures Palestinian territory from confiscation for settlements, opens up job opportunities under an otherwise brutal occupation, and blocks the brain drain of talented Palestinians. If, he adds, such a developmental project is, as some critics assert, making the occupation look good, then, \\"maybe we should live in tents, maybe we should all freeze to death.\\" In designing the project, he didn't think that 'Israel and Palestine would kiss and be happy.'Daisy Carrington, 'New city offers vision of better life in West Bank,' CNN News, 5 July 2013.

The first one lasted from the beginnings in the 11th century until the first divisions of the county between two Sponheimish lines around 1234. In this first period the region was ruled by a single count. In the second phase the county was managed by two counts. The ‚ÄúFurther‚Äù County (Vordere Grafschaft) of Sponheim was ruled by the line Sponheim-Kreuznach with residence at Castle Kauzenburg near Kreuznach. The \\"Hinder\\" County (Hintere Grafschaft) of Sponheim was ruled by the Sponheim-Starkenburg line, with residence at first at Castle Starkenburg near Enkirch and after 1350 at Castle Grevenburg near Trarbach. This phase lasted nearly to the extinction of both lines in 1437. Finally in the third phase both parts of the county were managed by joint rulers as a condominium. The management of the ‚ÄúHinder‚Äù County of Sponheim was divided between a collateral palatine line (House of Palatinate-Simmern, later House of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken, later still House of Palatinate-Birkenfeld) and Baden, the management of the ‚ÄúFurther‚Äù County of Sponheim roughly between Baden and the Electoral Palatinate.

It was written by Philip Yordan. The story revolves around a love triangle set in Mexico's oilfields, where bandits are still active. Ruth Roman also stars and adds to the romantic entanglements. Frankie Laine sang the title song, \\"Blowing Wild (The Ballad of Black Gold)\\", which was written by Dmitri Tiomkin, with lyrics by Paul Francis Webster. Plot After the bandit El Gavilan and his men blow up their South American oil rig, broke wildcatters Jeff Dawson and \\"Dutch\\" Peterson head back to town, looking for work. Sal Donnelly, an American down on her luck, tries to use her charms to get Jeff to buy her a ticket to get home; Jeff offers his oil lease as payment, but the ticket taker shows him a fistful of leases he already has. Jeff accepts a very dangerous job delivering unstable nitroglycerin the next day for $800, despite Dutch's protests. That night, Dutch tries to mug a man for enough money to buy a meal. The man turns out to be \\"Paco\\" Conway, an old friend and former partner of Jeff and Dutch, who has struck it rich. He offers them work, but his marriage to Jeff's old flame Marina makes Jeff turn it down. The next day, Jeff and Dutch (and the nitroglycerin) are ambushed by El Gavilan. They get away, though Dutch is shot in the leg. When Jeff goes to collect their pay, Jackson claims he does not have that much on him. Sal, whom Jackson is romancing, tells Jeff that Jackson has $2500 in his wallet. Jeff gets his money, after a brawl, and gives $200 to Sal for her ticket. However, a policeman confiscates Jeff's $600, as Jackson has other creditors, though he is gracious enough to leave Sal her money. With Dutch in the hospital, Jeff reluctantly goes to work for Paco, drilling a new oil well. Marina makes romantic overtures to Jeff, but he avoids her as best he can. He reminds her that he loved her once, but could not trust her. She admits it, but says she realized she loved him too after he had left. Paco remains oblivious to what is going on. To Jeff's initial annoyance, Sal gets a job as a blackjack dealer and sticks around. Later though, he starts going into town to see her. When El Gavilan threatens to blow up Paco's oil wells unless he pays $50,000 extortion money, Paco considers paying, much to Jeff's disgust. Marina sides with Jeff, calling her husband a coward. A drunken Paco later laments publicly that his wife loves another man. He finally realizes the other man is Jeff. When Paco tells her that he loves her regardless, Marina pushes him into a well, where the machinery kills him. Marina claims that Paco fell in by accident. When she lets slip to Jeff that she killed Paco so they could be together, he nearly strangles her, then regains control of himself and leaves the house. Just then, the bandits attack. The local police and Jeff fight them. Marina is irresistibly drawn to the fatal oil well during the battle, and dies when it is blown up. Jeff kills El Gavilan, then leaves with Dutch and Sal.

Weber has made records, videos and films with a variety of bands. Weber performed in GG Allin's final backing band The Murder Junkies, playing the electric guitar. He replaced Chicken John in the band. Weber performed on the sole GG Allin and the Murder Junkies studio album Brutality and Bloodshed for All. Following GG's untimely death, Weber performed in a continuation of the Murder Junkies, who eventually released a 10\\" mini-album (later re-released in an extended version on CD) entitled Feed My Sleaze. Weber's career with Allin encompassed three USA tours. A posthumous live album - Terror in America - appeared in 1994. The genesis of GG Allin and the Murder Junkies and the Brutality and Bloodshed for All album was that the backing band was formed by GG's brother Merle while GG was still in prison. Both Dee Dee Ramone and Weber were hired as guitarists; while Accidental Tribe member Donald ('Dino Sex') Sachs was recruited on drums. Ramone left the band before he even played a live show (although a recording session, featuring both he and a newly released GG, is preserved on film); the remainder of the band composed music for their forthcoming set - later to form the Brutality and Bloodshed for All album, whilst GG composed the lyrics from his prison cell without previously hearing the music. Weber has also made records, videos and films with the Chrome Cranks, The Candy Snatchers, The Tigerlilies, Sugarshock, The Brass Knuckle Boys, Human Zoo and as dumBASS. Weber currently resides in Cincinnati, Ohio.

His main work was Udsigt over den norske Historie, four volumes issued from 1873 to 1891. He co-edited the magazines Nyt norsk Tidskrift from 1877 to 1878, and Nyt Tidsskrift from 1882 to 1887. He was politically active for the Liberal Party of Norway and among the party's most central theoreticians. Biography=Personal life Sars was born in the parish of Kinn (now Flora Municipality) in Nordre Bergenhus Amt (now Sogn og Fjordane), Norway. He was the son of Michael Sars (1805‚Äì1869) and Maren Cathrine Welhaven (1811‚Äì1898). His father was vicar at Kinn Church and at Manger Church and was professor of zoology at the University of Christiania from 1854. His mother was a sister of poet Johan Sebastian Welhaven and author Elisabeth Welhaven. He was a brother of singer Eva Sars and zoologist Georg Ossian Sars. He was a cousin of architect Hjalmar Welhaven as well as a brother-in-law of explorer and scientist Fridtjof Nansen and musician Thorvald Lammers. He was not married, and lived along with his brother at their mother's residence until she died in 1898. He died at Aker in 1917. Career Sars attended the Bergen Cathedral School from 1849. In 1853 he moved to Christiania (now Oslo) as a student. He initiated studies in medicine, but he started to study history. In 1856, he was awarded the Crown Prince's gold medal (Kronprinsens gullmedalje) for having written a prize-winning treatise on the Kalmar Union. He spent the summers 1858 and 1859 in Copenhagen, in order to copy Norwegian documents in Danish archives. He wrote a pioneering work on Norway during the union with Denmark (), published in four parts between 1858 and 1865. He was appointed as an assistant at the National Archival Services of Norway () from 1860 to 1874. After having received a scholarship he lectured at the University of Kristiania from 1870, where he first introduced the subject positivism, and later lectured on Norwegian history. His main work was Udsigt over den norske Historie, a continuous treatment of Norwegian history from the Viking era to contemporary times, which was published in four volumes between 1873 and 1891. The first volume of the series established Sars among the leading intellectuals in Norway. It earned him an extraordinary professorship in 1874, after a Parliamentary decision. Sars co-edited the magazines Nyt norsk Tidskrift (with Jens Lieblein) from 1877 to 1878, and Nyt Tidsskrift (with Olaf Skavlan) from 1882 to 1887. He took part in politics, and was active for the Liberal Party, along with Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson. After his publication of Historisk Indledning til Grundloven (Historical Introduction to the Constitution) in 1882, he was regarded among the Liberal Party's most central theoreticians. He also regarded the dissolution of the union between Sweden and Norway to be the only practical solution to the conflicts with Sweden. He wrote the work Norges politiske historie 1815‚Äì85, published between 1899 and 1904, and continued lecturing until 1911.

Architecture  Saint Marianeh church was built in 1271 (according to some sources 1281), and has proportions peculiar to the given period of its construction. It has a rectangular plan from the exterior and a cruciform central-plan from the interior, and two-tiered side-chapels join the apse from the western and eastern sides. Of particular interest is the church's drum that is circular from the interior and decahedral from the exterior. A tall dome rests on top. Fa√ßades of the church, drum, and dome are simply adorned with cruciform decorations around the rectangular windows. The main portal into the structure is at the southern wall, with a belfry over this wing built in 1838. Another portal leads into the church from the western wall.

She attracted media attention in the 1980s during her divorce trial from Herbert \\"Peter\\" Pulitzer.  Biography Pulitzer was born Roxanne Renckens on February 10, 1951, in Cassadaga, New York, to Marilyn Pauline (n√©e Simpson) and William James Renckens. Her father is of Luxembourgian descent. When Renckens was young, her father left town at her mother's request. Her mother remarried to Tyrone H. Ulrich, a police officer. She has a sister, Pamela, and a brother, Keith. Roxanne is a former cheerleader. Her first husband was Peter Dixon, whom she left while they were living in South Florida.Jeff Woloson, Online bio of Roxanne Pulitzer's marriage years () She met Palm Beach-based newspaper tycoon Herbert \\"Peter\\" Pulitzer (heir to Pulitzer, Inc.) at a party; they married, and their twin sons Maclean Simpson Pulitzer (\\"Mac\\") and Zachary Simpson Pulitzer (\\"Zac\\") were born in 1978. In 1982, Herbert sued for divorce. Roxanne was granted custody in an emergency hearing. Circuit Judge Carl Harper slapped a gag order on all parties involved, to little effect. Herbert's main accusation was that Roxanne wrecked their marriage with adultery and drug abuse. Both claimed that the other had had sexual encounters with Jacquie Kimberly, wife of James Kimberly, heir to the Kleenex fortune. Herbert also claimed she had affairs with four men, including Jacky Ickx, the racing driver. Judge Harper eventually granted Herbert Pulitzer custody of the children. She received $48,000 in alimony over 2 years. Roxanne appealed three times but was unsuccessful. She attracted media attention in 1983 during the proceedings; many of the headlines about her were unfavorable, some referring to her as \\"Foxy Roxy\\". In 1984, they briefly resumed relations and considered remarriage. In 1991, she was involved in the divorce case of French count and racecar driver Jean de la Moussaye. In 1992, she married again, to speedboat racer John Haggin Jr. Their marriage ended after 8 weeks. She is currently () married to Timothy S. Boberg and resides in Palm Beach. Literary and media career Pulitzer is the author of an autobiography, Prize Pulitzer: The Scandal That Rocked Palm Beach, and the novels Facade, Twins and The Palm Beach Story. Her autobiography was later adapted into a made-for-television movie, Roxanne: The Prize Pulitzer, written from her point of view. She also appeared on the June 1985 cover and interior of Playboy Magazine. The $70,000 she received was used to pay her divorce bills.

The museum is focused in learning, communication and working together through interactive expositions of science, technology and art for children. Building This museum was created in 1993 by the architect Ricardo Legorreta. He designed the building with geometric figures and traditional Mexican tiles. The building was made for kids to interact, experiment and touch. The ceiling and walls were made by children. Areas This museum has over 288 interactive exhibitions, divided into five areas where children can touch, play, and learn, as its motto says. Children become familiar with such subjects as ecology, the human body, science, and music. Each area features exhibitions about an aspect of human development. Soy: Spanish for \\"I am\\". Focuses on the way human body and mind work. Themes featured are identity, self-esteem, and knowledge of one's body and emotions. Comunico: Spanish for \\"I communicate myself\\". Focuses on the different ways people can communicate with each other, from spoken and sign language to radio, television and newspaper, helping to understand how each one of them works. Pertenezco: Spanish for \\"I belong\\". Focuses on helping the children to understand themselves in terms of the spaces they belong to, going from what it is most close to them, their family, to the most complex, the universe, and the necessity to protect the environment they live in. Comprendo: Spanish for \\"I understand\\". Focuses on science, comprising physics, mathematics, chemistry and geology, helping to understand what does science mean to the world. Expreso: Spanish for \\"I express myself\\". Focuses on developing abilities in creativity and imagination to express ideas, feelings and thoughts throughout art, creation, discovery and appreciation.

It is primarily broadcast from Franklin, Tennessee, though often during the summer it is broadcast via remote from Ramsey's lake house. , it is one of the top ten most-listened-to radio shows. Ramsey takes live calls on the theme of finance, and occasionally money- related Christian philosophy as it pertains to tithing, etc. During the show, he discusses life and money-related issues with callers. He is known for his complete disdain of debt collectors, calling them (among other things) \\"scum\\" and dishonest, and urging his listeners not to deal with them unless necessary, and then to get everything in writing, especially involving offers to reduce debts. With a simple, seven-stage \\"baby steps\\" formula (Baby Step Two is based on the debt snowball method), Ramsey urges listeners to avoid all debt except for certain types of home mortgages. Ramsey's Seven Baby Steps are: 1\\\\. Save $1,000 for a starter emergency fund. 2\\\\. Pay off all debt (except the house) using the debt snowball. 3\\\\. Save 3-6 months expenses in a fully funded emergency fund. 4\\\\. Invest 15% of household income in retirement. 5\\\\. Save for children's college fund. 6\\\\. Pay off home early. 7\\\\. Build wealth and give. One notable difference between his and other financial shows is that Ramsey attempts to go beyond mathematical mechanics and reach his callers on an emotional and spiritual level. The show has a channel on iHeartRadio, and on Sirius XM Radio.  History  The program began June 15, 1992, when Ramsey, selling copies of Financial Peace out of the trunk of his car, was a guest on 99.7 WWTN. The station had recently filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy and one of its hosts had quit after not getting paid, which left the station scrambling to fill the gap in its lineup. Ramsey offered to do a one-hour show for free for one month, not entirely expecting to be successful. The Money Game went on the air with Ramsey, Hal Wilson and Roy Matlock each hosting the hour alone on certain days of the week. Ramsey was the bankruptcy and \\"get out of debt\\" guru on Mondays and Wednesdays, Matlock answered investing questions Tuesdays and Thursdays, and Wilson's Friday topic was primarily real estate. After station management asked Wilson to discontinue his portion of the program, Ramsey and Matlock teamed up to host the show five days per week. Eventually, Matlock left the show on good terms to focus on his financial services business, leaving Ramsey to host the show alone. The program became quite popular in Nashville. Reportedly, when WWTN asked Ramsey who would be syndicating his show, Ramsey simply pointed to Blake Thompson, who continues as executive producer of the show to this day. As Bill Hampton, Vice President of The Lampo Group stated, \\"they learned syndication from the ground up.\\" The Money Game changed its name to The Dave Ramsey Show in mid-1996. As of 2017, the show is heard on more than 585 stations. In 2006, the show received two nominations for the 2006 Radio & Records News/Talk Industry Achievement Awards. It is the fifth year in a row for Dave Ramsey in the \\"Syndicated Personality of the Year\\" category, and the second year in a row for Bill Hampton in the \\"Executive of the Year\\" category. On the success of the show, Bill Hampton stated that it did $2.5 million in network sales in 2005 while MyTMMO.com did $1.2 million. He also stated the show would bring in an estimated $3.7 million from advertisers. The show is now also available on podcast via iTunes. Ramsey's show is one of very few national radio shows to be self-syndicated. The program is not connected to any national network or programming service, and is distributed directly to local stations. Ramsey's show is fed to stations 24/7 so that stations will not have to record his show for later broadcast, but rather they can always use the satellite feed. The show is distributed via Westwood One's satellite platform. After 20 years of broadcasting on WTN, on January 1, 2013, the show moved to 102.5 FM (\\"The Game\\"). Ramsey and WTN were unable to come to terms over a renewal contract. One year later, on January 1, 2014, the show moved to WLAC.

It was aired each weekday, except Thursdays, at 8:00 p.m. ET. On Thursdays the program aired at 10:00 p.m. ET. The show typically started with a brief financial advice or opinion monologue. The bulk of the show was devoted to helping callers and e-mailers with their financial questions and problems, including personal finance, divorce, debt, and small business problems. A typical show ended with viewer e-mails. Friday shows tend to be devoted to callers and e-mailers discussing their debt elimination and proclaiming \\"I'm debt free!\\" In early 2008, Ramsey expanded the show's format to add in studio and via-satellite interviews of notable authors relating to personal finance. Starting in May 2008, The Dave Ramsey Road Show was occasionally inserted into the 8:00 p.m. ET time slot. Instead of the normal live show with callers, The Dave Ramsey Road Show is an hour- long presentation of one of the numerous live lectures Ramsey gives in arenas across the country. As a result of the success of the program, a new studio was introduced on May 5, 2008, featuring multiple plasma screen monitors and new camera angles.

Organised by some London commune dwellers, notably Ubi Dwyer and Sid Rawle, it was in many ways the forerunner of the Stonehenge Free Festival, particularly in the brutality of its final suppression by the police, which led to a public outcry about the tactics involved. History The first Festival in 1972 was promoted as \\"Rent Strike: The People's Free Festival\\", reflecting the political concerns of the organisers (coming as they did from squatting and commune movements), with an anti-monarchist choice of site in \\"the Queen's back garden\\". Attendance was about 700 in its first year, rising to 8,000 in 1973, and an even larger crowd in its final year. The 1974 Festival, due to last for ten days, was broken up on the sixth morning by a large number of police. Early on 29 August 1974 the site was invaded by hundreds of officers from the Thames Valley police force with truncheons drawn, who gave the remaining participants ten minutes to leave. Those who did not were arrested or evicted with a level of force that led seven national newspapers to call for an inquiry, and Roy Jenkins, the Home Secretary, to call for a report from the Thames Valley Chief Constable. Nicholas Albery, playwright Heathcote Williams and his partner Diana Senior successfully sued David Holdsworth, the Thames Valley Chief Constable for creating a riotous situation in which the police attacked the plaintiffs.Alan Dearling's \\"Not only but also...\\" memoirs of Free Festivals In 1975 both Ubi Dwyer and Sid Rawle were imprisoned, for attempting to promote a 1975 Windsor Festival. A further attempt to return to Windsor in 1978 led to another arrest for Ubi Dwyer. The government provided an abandoned airfield at Watchfield in 1975, in response to the public outrage, and as a means of moving the festival away from Royal castles, but the atmosphere of this event was poor compared to Stonehenge, where the energy of the People's Free Festival continued.
