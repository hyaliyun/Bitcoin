According to some myths, he was autochthonous (born of the soil, or Earth) and raised by the goddess Athena. Early Greek texts do not distinguish between him and Erechtheus,Homer, Iliad 2.546‚Äì551. his grandson, but by the fourth century BC, during Classical times, they are distinct figures.

The connection of ·ºòœÅŒπœáŒ∏œåŒΩŒπŒøœÇ with ·ºêœÅŒ≠œáŒ∏œâ, \\"shake\\" is a late folk- etymology; other folk-etymologies include ·ºîœÅŒπŒøŒΩ, erion, \\"wool\\" or eris, \\"strife\\"+ œáŒ∏œéŒΩ chth√¥n or chthonos, \\"earth\\".Beekes, s.v. ·ºòœÅŒπœáŒ∏œåŒΩŒπŒøœÇ, has suggested a Pre-Greek proto-form *Erektyeu-Graves, 25 \\"Athene's Nature and Deeds\\", p. 99.  Mythology  =Birth= Athena Scorning the Advances of Hephaestus, Paris Bordone, between c. 1555 and c. 1560 According to the Bibliotheca, Athena visited the smith-god Hephaestus to request some weapons, but Hephaestus was so overcome by desire that he tried to seduce her in his workshop. Determined to maintain her virginity, Athena fled, pursued by Hephaestus. He caught Athena and tried to rape her, but she fought him off. During the struggle, his semen fell on her thigh, and Athena, in disgust, wiped it away with a scrap of wool (·ºîœÅŒπŒøŒΩ, erion) and flung it to the earth (œáŒ∏œéŒΩ, chth√¥n). As she fled, Erichthonius was born from the semen that fell to the earth. Athena, wishing to raise the child in secret, placed him in a small box. And then made sure no one would ever find out by giving him away.Apollodorus, 3.14.6. Athena gave the box to the three daughters (Herse, Aglaurus and Pandrosus) of Cecrops, the king of Athens, and warned them never to look inside. Pandrosus obeyed, but Herse and Aglaurus were overcome with curiosity and opened the box, which contained the infant and future-king, Erichthonius (\\"troubles born from the earth,\\" following another etymology). (Sources are unclear regarding how many sisters participated.) The sisters were terrified by what they saw in the box: either a snake coiled around an infant, or an infant that was half-human and half-serpent. They went insane and threw themselves off the Acropolis. Other accounts state that they were killed by the snake. An alternative version of the story is that Athena left the box with the daughters of Cecrops while she went to fetch a limestone mountain from the Pallene peninsula to use in the Acropolis. While she was away, Aglaurus and Herse opened the box. A crow saw them open the box, and flew away to tell Athena, who fell into a rage and dropped the mountain she was carrying (now Mt. Lykabettos). As in the first version, Herse and Aglaurus went insane and threw themselves to their deaths off a cliff. =Reign= When he grew up, Erichthonius drove out Amphictyon, who had usurped the throne from Cranaus twelve years earlier, and became king of Athens. He married Praxithea, a naiad, and had a son, Pandion I. During this time, Athena frequently protected him. He founded the Panathenaic Festival in the honor of Athena, and set up a wooden statue of her on the Acropolis. According to the Parian Chronicle, he taught his people to yoke horses and use them to pull chariots, to smelt silver, and to till the earth with a plough. It was said that Erichthonius was lame of his feet and that he consequently invented the quadriga, or four-horse chariot, to get around more easily. He is said to have competed often as a chariot driver in games. Zeus was said to have been so impressed with his skill that he raised him to the heavens to become the constellation of the Charioteer (Auriga) after his death. The snake is his symbol, and he is represented in the statue of Athena in the Parthenon as the snake hidden behind her shield. The most sacred building on the Acropolis of Athens, the Erechtheum, is dedicated to Erichthonius. Erichthonius was succeeded by his son Pandion I.

Ice fishing is the practice of catching fish with lines and fish hooks or spears through an opening in the ice on a frozen body of water. Ice fishers may fish in the open or in heated enclosures, some with bunks and amenities. Shelters Ice fishing on the Ottawa river, near the capital of Canada Snail shelters for wakasagi ice fishing on the Lake ≈åno, near Mount Akagi, Maebashi, Gunma Prefecture, Japan. Longer fishing expeditions can be mounted with simple structures. Larger, heated structures can make multiple day fishing trips possible. A structure with various local names, but often called an ice shanty, ice shack, fish house, shack, bobhouse, or ice hut, is sometimes used. These are dragged or towed onto the lake using a vehicle such as a snowmobile, ATV or truck. The two most commonly used types are portable and permanent. The portable houses are often made of a heavy material that is usually watertight. The two most common types of portable houses are those with a shelter that flips behind the user when not needed, or pop up shelters with a door as the only way out. The permanent shelters are made of wood or metal and usually have wheels for easy transport. They can be as basic as a bunk heater and holes or have satellite television, bathrooms, stoves, full-size beds and may appear to be more like a mobile home than a fishing house. In North America, ice fishing is often a social activity. Some resorts have fish houses that are rented out by the day; often, shuttle service by Snow Track or other vehicles modified to drive on ice is provided. In Finland, solitary and contemplative isolation is often the object of the pastime. In Finland, fish houses are a rare occurrence, but wearing a sealed and insulated dry suit designed with space-age fabric is not. In North America, portable houses appear to create a city at locations where fishing is best. Fishing equipment Hand ice auger Ice fishing gear is highly specialized. An ice saw, ice auger or chisel is used to cut a circular or rectangular hole in the ice. The size of the hole depends on the type of fish sought, generally suggested is 8 inches (20 cm). Power augers are sometimes used. If these tools are not available, an axe may be used to chop the hole. A skimmer, a large metal spoon with holes in it, is used to remove new ice as it forms and to clear slush left from making the hole. During colder periods most ice anglers choose to carry a heater of some type. The heater is not only for warmth but also for keeping an angler's fishing hole from freezing. When temperatures fall to -20 ¬∞F (-29 ¬∞C) or colder it becomes very hard to keep a fishing hole open. Three main types of fishing occur. The first is using a small, light fishing rod with small, brightly coloured lures or jigs with bait such as wax worms, fat heads or crappie or shiner minnows. The angler sits at the hole in the ice and lifts the pole every now and then, producing the jig effect. The second is using tip-ups, which are made of wood or plastic, and have a spool of line attached, with a thin piece of metal that goes from the spool to the flag. Black line is put on the spool and a swivel is placed at the end of the black line. Then a piece of fishing line with a hook is attached to the swivel. Worms, power bait, grub worms or small minnows are placed on the hook. The hook with bait is placed into the water under the ice. The depth that the bait is placed goes according to several theories. One theory is the bait is placed one meter under the ice. The second is that the bait is placed two to three metres under the ice. The third is that the bait is suspended one foot (30 cm) above the bottom of the lake. When the fish strikes the bait the flag is lifted which notifies the angler that she has a fish on the hook. The angler pulls the line in and the fish fights. The angler will allow the line to slip through her hands during the struggle. Finally, when the angler can get the fish's head into the hole in the ice, the fish is quickly lifted onto the ice. This allows for less-intensive fishing. The third method is spear fishing. A large hole is cut in the ice and fish decoys may be deployed. The angler sits in a dark ice shanty called a dark house. The angler then peers into the water while holding a large spear which has four or five points. A line can be attached to the points. The fisher waits for fish to appear, then plunges the spear into the water. This method is often used for lake sturgeon fishing. In the United States many states allow only rough fish to be taken while spear fishing. Becoming increasingly popular is the use of a flasher, similar to its summer cousin the fishfinder . This is a sonar system that provides depth information, as well as indicating the presence of fish or other objects. These flashers, unlike most typical fishfinders, display the movement of fish and other objects almost instantaneously. The bait being used can often be seen as a mark on the flasher, enabling the angler to position the bait right in front of the fish. Underwater cameras are also now available which allow the user to view the fish and observe their reaction to the lure presentation. Clubbing is an old method seldom used today, mainly used on burbot, the fisher walks on clear ice in shallow water and sees a large fish through the ice and with a large club which she or he slams into the ice, the shockwave hits the fish and it is temporary paralyzed, which gives the fisher time to cut a hole in the ice to collect the fish. Modern ice fishing Ice fishing methods have changed drastically over the past 20 years. The name of the game is mobility for today's modern ice anglers. The days of drilling hole, waiting and hoping that a fish will swim by, are starting to fade. With light gear, battery-operated sonar units, and fast and powered augers, an angler can conceivably drill and check hundreds of holes in a single day. When the fish stop biting where they are, anglers can move to the next hole, checking it with their sonar first to look for activity, and if there are no fish they will keep moving until fish are found. In addition, schools of fish tend to move around; so a hole may be productive for 10 minutes and then slow down to nothing for an hour before a school returns to that location. This \\"fish where the fish are\\" technique and ease of mobility increases the catch rate of any angler, because it minimizes the wait between bites, similar to \\"trolling\\" in the month of summer. Anglers can now use many available maps and surveys to help pinpoint lakes and areas within those lakes that make sense to try for specific fish, noting those locations in latitude and longitude coordinates. They are then able to use a handheld GPS receiver to aim them to those spots, usually with accuracy of less than 20 feet. Ice anglers then drill holes with whichever auger they have, checking the ice thickness for safety as they go. Using sonar, the angler can determine the depth of the water, bottom content, weed and structure cover, and even see if there are fish there. Also, by using sonar, they can place the bait according to where they think the fish are. If they are using \\"tip-ups\\" they can carpet the area at different depths and with different presentations (the number allowed being determined by local laws) and see what is the most productive. Modern ice anglers can also use modern reels mounted on shorter (18\\"-36\\"/45‚Äì90 cm long) fishing rods to actively fish by watching, by using their sonar, where their lure is relative to the fish, and jig accordingly to entice a bite. Ice fishing can be done at any time of day, and is typically most active around dusk and dawn. Different fish are active at different times of day, so anglers need to fish for them accordingly. There are fish houses large enough and comfortable enough to spend many days in a row out on the lake, fishing the entire time. One can even fish in one's sleep, by using audible alarms on one's lines to tell when a fish is biting. There are also many lightweight and highly mobile portable shelters that mount on plastic sleds and collapse for transportation. These can vary from small, one-person shelters (commonly called \\"Fish Traps\\") to large and complex shelters able to fit up to 20 people at once. Dangers thumb Many anglers will go out with 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) of good ice for walking, but the recommended is 4 inches (10 cm), 5‚Äì6 inches (13‚Äì15 cm) for sleds (snow machines, snowmobiles), 7‚Äì12 (18‚Äì30 cm) for light cars, and 14‚Äì16 inches (36‚Äì41 cm) for full-sized trucks. Thinner ice in areas with swift surface currents are a significant hazard. Offshore winds can break off miles- wide pans of ice, stranding large numbers of fishers. Just such a circumstance occurred in Lake Erie in February 2009, with 100 fishers having to be rescued by helicopters, local authorities, and the Coast Guard. One man who had fallen into the water died on the rescue flight.\\"Man Dies and Scores Are Rescued From Erie Ice Floe\\" by Liz Robbins, with Chris Maag in Sandusky, OH, The New York Times, 2-7-09. Retrieved 2-7-09. On March 28, 2013 as many as 220 ice anglers were trapped on break-away sea ice floes in the Gulf of Riga (Latvia), necessitating a full-scale rescue operation which employed helicopters and hovercrafts. A similar operation, usually of lesser scale, is typically required each year due to anglers' recklessness.Beachgoers stranded on Latvia ice floes Late-winter warm spells can destroy the texture of the ice, which, while still of the required thickness, will not adequately support weight. It is called \\"rotten ice\\" or soft ice and is exceedingly dangerous. Some ice anglers will continue to fish, since even with the bad ice normally 8 inches (20 cm) is more than enough. Fishers may carry a self-rescue device made of two spiked handles connected by a string to pull themselves out of the water and onto the ice. Many cars, trucks, SUVs, snowmobiles, and fish houses fall through the ice each year. Current environmental regulations require the speedy recovery of the vehicle or structure in this situation. Divers must be hired, and when the trouble occurs far from shore, helicopters may be employed for hoisting. Other risks associated with ice fishing include carbon monoxide poisoning from fish house heaters and frostbite due to prolonged exposure to wind and low temperatures, although most new houses are fitted with air exchange systems that allow air flow, preventing poisoning. Contests A participant at The Brainerd Jaycees Ice Fishing Extravaganza Participants of large Finnish ice fishing competition Miljoonapilkki in 2005. Ice fishing contests offer prizes for the largest number of fish caught within a limited time period, many offer a prize for the biggest fish caught as well. The current world's largest contest, the Brainerd Jaycees Ice Fishing Extravaganza, is held on Gull Lake, north of Brainerd, Minnesota, in January of each year. The contest has over 15,000 anglers and drills over 20,000 holes for the contest. In recent years, the money this contest raises for charity has risen to $150,000. Lake Simcoe in Canada has abundant cold water fish such as lake trout, herring and whitefish. It is sometimes known as Canada's ice fishing capital. In Hwacheon, South Korea, a large ice fishing festival is held every January. The Ice Festival draws nearly a million visitors every year, and thousands of people have taken part in a contest to catch fish in a frozen Hwacheoncheon(a tributary of the Han River).

His childhood on a small Wiltshire farm had a great influence on him and provides the background to all his major works of fiction. Jefferies's corpus of writings covers a range of genres and topics, including Bevis (1882), a classic children's book, and After London (1885), a work of science fiction. For much of his adult life he suffered from tuberculosis, and his struggles with the illness and with poverty also play a role in his writing. Jefferies valued and cultivated an intensity of feeling in his experience of the world around him, a cultivation that he describes in detail in The Story of My Heart (1883). This work, an introspective depiction of his thoughts and feelings about the world, gained him the reputation of a nature mystic at the time, but it is his success in conveying his awareness of nature and people within it, both in his fiction and in essay collections such as The Amateur Poacher (1879) and Round About a Great Estate (1880), that has drawn most admirers. Walter Besant wrote of his reaction on first reading Jefferies: \\"Why, we must have been blind all our lives; here were the most wonderful things possible going on under our very noses, but we saw them not.\\"Besant (1905), 167. Life and works Coate farm in 1896. The roof was originally thatched.Looker and Porteous (1965), 4, cite a letter by James Jefferies: \\"My old house was originally thatch. ... I have not seen it since Blue Slates as been put on.\\" =Early life= John Richard Jefferies (he used the first name only during his childhood)Thomas (1909), 29. was born at Coate in the parish of Chiseldon, near Swindon, Wiltshire, the son of a farmer, James Luckett Jefferies (1816‚Äì1896).Rossabi (2004). His birthplace and home is now a museum open to the public. James Jefferies had the farm from his father, John Jefferies, who had been a printer in London before returning to Swindon to run the family mill and bakery. Richard's mother, Elizabeth Gyde (1817‚Äì1895), always called Betsy, was the daughter of John Jefferies's binder and manager. These relationships are mirrored in the characters of Jefferies's late novel Amaryllis at the Fair (1887); and the portraits of the family in the novel tally with external accounts of the Jefferies.Besant (1905), 5; 14‚Äì16; Thomas (1909), 24‚Äì5; 28‚Äì29; Rossabi (2004). James Jefferies, like Iden in Amaryllis, was devoted to his garden, while struggling to make a financial success of the farm. The garden, lovingly recalled in Wood Magic and Amaryllis, also made a strong impression on the memories of those who knew the Jefferies at the time.Besant (1905), 4; Thomas (1909), 29‚Äì30. Betsy, like Iden's wife, seems to have been dissatisfied with life on the farm: \\"a town- bred woman with a beautiful face and a pleasure-loving soul, kind and generous to a fault, but unsuited to a country life.\\" The farm was very small, with of pasture; and a mortgage of ¬£1500 would later begin a slide into debt for James Jefferies, who lost the farm in 1877 and became a jobbing gardener.Rossabi (2004) But these difficulties were less evident in Richard's childhood. The situation was much as in After London (1885), where the farming and gardening Baron is again based on James Jefferies:After London, Chapter 4, cited in Thomas (1909), 47. \\"The whole place was thus falling to decay, while at the same time it seemed to be flowing with milk and honey\\". One part of the Jefferies family is strikingly missing from the books. In Wood Magic, Bevis and Amaryllis, the hero (or heroine) has no siblings; only After London gives the main character brothers and depicts the imperfect sympathy between them. James and Elizabeth's first child, Ellen, had died young; but Richard had two younger brothers and a younger sister. Jefferies spent several of his earlier years, between the ages of four and nine, with his aunt and uncle, the Harrilds, in Sydenham, where he attended a private school, returning to Coate in the holidays.Besant (1905), 27‚Äì8; Thomas (1909), 39; Rossabi (2004). His uncle, Thomas Harrild, was a son of the printing innovator Robert Harrild. Jefferies kept a close friendship with Mrs. Ellen Harrild (nee Gyde) and his letters to her are an important source for biographers. At Coate, he spent most of his time in the countryside; and much of what he narrates of Bevis is true of himself. His father had taken him shooting when he was eight; and already at nine he had shot a rabbit. He was soon spending much of his time hunting (both with a gun and with snares) and fishing.Thomas (1909), 39; 41‚Äì2; Looker and Porteous (1965), 16. He also, like Bevis, added home-made rigging to a boat to sail on the reservoir; and he is said to have built his own canoe, like the hero of After London.Besant (1905), 29‚Äì30; Thomas (1909), 40. At the same time, he became a keen reader: favourite books included Homer's Odyssey, Percy's Reliques, Don Quixote and James Fenimore Cooper's The Pathfinder, which served as a model for mock battles fought on a field between the farm and the reservoir.Thomas (1909), 45‚Äì6. In November 1864, at the age of sixteen, he and a cousin, James Cox, ran off to France, intending to walk to Russia. (Cox, slightly older than Jefferies, worked for the Great Western Railway and had a little money saved.) After crossing the channel, they soon found that their schoolboy French was insufficient and returned to England. Before they reached Swindon, they noticed an advertisement for cheap crossings from Liverpool to America and set off in this new direction. The tickets however, did not include the cost of food; and the boys were forced to return to Swindon after an attempt to pawn their watches had drawn the attention of the police.Besant (1905), 50‚Äì3; Thomas (1909), 46‚Äì7. Jefferies in 1872Jefferies left school at fifteen and at first continued his habits of solitary wanderings about the local countryside. He dressed carelessly and allowed his hair to grow down to his collar. This, with his \\"bent form and long, rapid stride made him an object of wonder in the town of Swindon. But he was perfectly unconscious of this, or indifferent to it.\\"Besant (1905), 57; Thomas (1909), 56; 65; Looker and Porteous (1965), 54. He helped little on the farm (his only enthusiasm was for chopping and splitting wood) and was regarded as something of an idler. The gun that he always carried drew the suspicion of local landowners ‚Äì one said, \\"That young Jefferies is not the sort of fellow you want hanging about in your covers\\".Thomas (1909), 47‚Äì9. Finally, early in 1866, he started work as a newspaper reporter for the North Wiltshire Herald.Thomas (1909), 50. For several years he worked as a reporter, contributing not only to the North Wiltshire Herald, but also to the Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard and to the Swindon Advertiser.Besant (1905), 60; Thomas (1909), 74. The editor of the Swindon Advertiser, William Morris, an antiquarian and local historian, lent Jefferies books and encouraged his early writing attempts.Besant (1905), 54‚Äì5; 60; Thomas (1909), 55. Jefferies himself developed an antiquarian interest in the countryside: he published articles on local history in the North Wiltshire Herald and was the first to notice a stone circle near Coate Farm. He was also spending much time on the downs, particularly at the iron age hill fort, Liddington Castle, where he would lie on the grass, ecstatically feeling and seeking a connection with the natural world.Thomas (1909), 20; 57‚Äì8; Rossabi (2004). In September 1867 and July 1868 he was very ill. In retrospect the illnesses were clearly the first symptoms of the tuberculosis that would kill him. He emerged from them weakened and very thin ‚Äì \\"My legs are as thin as a grasshopper's\\", he wrote to his aunt. Illness also prompted some reconsideration of his own character: he was going to be \\"not swell but stylish\\" in future, since people set so much store by appearance.Besant (1905), 70‚Äì5; Thomas (1909), 61‚Äì3; Rossabi (2004). He was now actively pursuing a career as a writer, writing a history of the Goddards, a local family, and Reporting, Editing, and Authorship: Practical Hints for Beginners in Literature (1873), in which he shared the fruits of his brief experience as a local reporter. Meanwhile the novels he was writing could not find a publisher.Thomas (1909), 74‚Äì8. What national attention he attracted was instead from a series of letters to The Times on the Wiltshire agricultural labourer, published in November 1872. The letters, like his other writings from this period, reflect the Conservative outlook of his upbringing.Thomas (1909), 80‚Äì3. In 1874, the year of his first published novel, The Scarlet Shawl, he married Jessie Baden (1853‚Äì1926), the daughter of a nearby farmer. After living for a few months at Coate Farm, the couple moved to a house in Swindon in 1875 (its current address is 93 Victoria Road); and their first child, Richard Harold Jefferies, was born there on 3 May.Thomas (1909), 96; Rossabi (2004). =First successes= Essays While in Swindon, Jefferies had found it difficult to seek publication or employment with London publishers;Besant (1905), 83‚Äì5. and early in 1877, with Jessie and their baby son Harold, he moved to a house at what is now 296 Ewell Road, Tolworth, near Surbiton.Thomas (1909), 111; Rossabi (2004). (There is a wooden plaque commemorating this by the entrance to Surbiton Library.Literary Surrey Page 72) The area was then at the limits of London's growth. Jefferies spent much time wandering through the nearby countryside; and these walks would later provide the material for Nature Near London (1883).Thomas (1909), 111‚Äì5. Anemone leaf from Round About a Great Estate, described in chap. 5. Smith, Elder & Co. used the emblem in subsequent editions of Jefferies's books.Miller and Matthews (1993), 232. The Surbiton years were momentous. The couple's next child, a daughter called Jessie after her mother (but known by her second name, Phyllis), was born (on 6 December 1880), and Jefferies began to make his name at last. His new surroundings defined him, both to himself and others, as a country writer. Articles drawing on Jefferies's Wiltshire experiences found a ready market in The Pall Mall Gazette. First came a series of essays based on his friendship with the keeper of the Burderop estate, near Coate, The Gamekeeper at Home, collected as a book in 1878. The book was well received and Jefferies was compared with the great English nature writer, Gilbert White. Three more collections followed the same pattern of publication in The Pall Mall Gazette and then in book form: Wild Life in a Southern County and The Amateur Poacher (both 1879), and Round About a Great Estate (1880). Another collection, Hodge and his Masters (1880), brought together articles first published in the Standard. In the few years that Jefferies took to write these essays, his literary skill developed rapidly: The Amateur Poacher in particular is regarded as a major advance on the earlier works, the first in which he approaches the autobiographical subject matter that is behind his best works.Thomas (1909), 132; Keith (1965), 64 \\"It is, in my opinion, easily the best of the country books, and this judgment would not, I think, be disputed by most readers\\". A minor novel, Greene Ferne Farm (1880), was the first to gain recognition, both from contemporaries and in later scholarship.Miller and Matthews (1993), 202 on its contemporary reception; Leavis (1989), 262, \\"Greene Ferne Farm is the best of his early novels comparable with the Hardy of Under the Greenwood Tree.\\" The Bevis books Two books of these years form a sequence. Wood Magic: A Fable (1881) introduces his child-hero, Bevis, a small child on a farm near a small lake, called the \\"Longpond\\", clearly Coate Farm and Coate Reservoir. Bevis's exploration of the garden and neighbouring fields brings him into contact with the country's birds and animals, who can speak to him, as can even inanimate parts of nature, such as the stream and the wind. Part of the book is a depiction of a small child's interaction with the natural world, but much is a cynical animal fable of a revolt against the magpie Kapchack, the local tyrant. In Bevis (1882), the boy is older, and the fantasy element, by which animals can talk, is quite absent. Rather, we have realistically related adventures of Bevis and his friend Mark, fighting a mock battle with other local children, rigging a boat and sailing to an island on the lake (which they call \\"The New Sea\\"), fishing and even shooting with a homemade gun. =Illness and death= Onset In December 1881, Jefferies began to suffer from his until then undiagnosed tuberculosis, with an anal fistula. After a series of painful operations, he moved to West Brighton to convalesce. About this time he wrote his extraordinary autobiography, The Story of My Heart (1883). He had been planning this work for seventeen years and, in his words, it was \\"absolutely and unflinchingly true\\". It was not an autobiography of the events of his life, but an outpouring of his deepest thoughts and feelings. Articles about the Surbiton area were reprinted in the popular Nature Near London (1883), although the last chapters of the book refer to Beachy Head, Ditchling Beacon and other Sussex landmarks. In Brighton, his third child, Richard Oliver Launcelot Jefferies, was born on 18 July 1883. But his life was to be a short one. Jefferies moved to Eltham, then in Kent, now a part of Greenwich, in June 1884, and here, early in 1885, the child died suddenly of meningitis. Jefferies was so affected that he could not attend the funeral.Looker and Porteous (1965), 169, quoting Jefferies's son Harold, \\"His sufferings were so great that they prevented him from attending the funeral ... The agonized expression on father's face, as he stood at the open door, watching the little procession move away, haunted my mind for many years\\"; Rossabi (2004). After London Jefferies's next novel, After London (1885), can be seen as an early example of \\"post-apocalyptic fiction\\": after some sudden and unspecified catastrophe has depopulated England, the countryside reverts to nature, and the few survivors to a quasi-medieval way of life. The book has two parts. The first, \\"The Relapse into Barbarism\\", is the account by some later historian of the fall of civilisation and its consequences, with a loving description of nature reclaiming England: fields becoming overrun by forest, domesticated animals running wild, roads and towns becoming overgrown, the hated London reverting to lake and poisonous swampland. The second part, \\"Wild England\\", is largely a straightforward adventure set many years later in the wild landscape and society (here too Jefferies was setting an example for the genre); but the opening section, despite some improbabilities, has been much admired for its rigour and compelling narrative. Critics dissatisfied with the second part often make an exception of chapters 22‚Äì24, which go beyond recreation of a medieval world to give a disturbing and surreal description of the site of the fallen city.Thomas (1909), 256 \\"[The Relapse into Barbarism] reveals an unsuspected strength of remorseless logic and restraint\\"; Fowles (1980), xviii‚Äìxix; Miller and Matthews (1993), 440. Jefferies's interest in catastrophes predates After London: two short unpublished pieces from the 1870s describe social collapse after London is paralysed by freak winter conditions. In the better achieved of these, the narrator is a future historian piecing the story together from surviving accounts.Fowles (1980), x (the fragment, called The Great Snow by Looker, is given in an appendix to the same edition, 243-8); Miller and Matthews (1993), 432‚Äì3. The fantasy of the second part also has a predecessor in a short work, The Rise of Maximin, Emperor of the Occident, serialised in The New Monthly Magazine in 1876, in this case an adventure set in a remote and imaginary past.Fowles (1980), xi‚Äìxv; Miller and Matthews (1993), 33‚Äì6, 431‚Äì2. Although the society that Jefferies depicts after the fall of London is an unpleasant one, with oppressive petty tyrants at war with each other, and insecurity and injustice for the poor, it still served as an inspiration for William Morris's utopian News from Nowhere (1890). In a letter of 1885, he writes of his reaction to After London: \\"absurd hopes curled around my heart as I read it.\\"Fowles (1980), vii‚Äìviii. After London also influenced M.P. Shiel's post-apocalyptic novel, The Purple Cloud.\\"In writing The Purple Cloud, Shiel drew heavily on another fine novel, Richard Jefferies' After London\\".John Sutherland, \\"Introduction\\" to The Purple Cloud, Penguin Classics, 2012. Final years After Eltham, Jefferies lived briefly in various parts of Sussex, first at Rotherfield, then in a house on Crowborough Hill. In Crowborough Jefferies completed his most ambitious and most unusual novel, Amaryllis at the Fair (1887). Closely based on his own family at Coate, it describes a farm and a family imperceptibly approaching disaster. There is little narrative development; instead significant or typical moments are presented in short scenes or even tableaux.Cf. Besant (1905), 151‚Äì2 (on the later novels generally); Keith (1965), 139‚Äì43, particularly 139, citing a letter of Jefferies: \\"I originally intended this book to form a series of scenes from country life and so proposed to call it Scenes from Country Life ... The idea of calling it a novel was secondary.\\" Illness and resulting lower productivity had impoverished Jefferies; and the editor Charles Longman suggested an application to the Royal Literary Fund. At first Jefferies resisted the suggestion, regarding aid from aristocratic patrons not involved in literary work as humiliating: \\"Patrons of literature! was there ever such a disgrace in the nineteenth century? Patrons of literature! The thing is simply abominable!\\" Longman finally succeeded in convincing Jefferies that the fund was \\"assisted by everybody who had made any success in literature\\". An application was accepted and the committee voted a grant of one hundred pounds. Another fund arranged by Longman enabled Jefferies to move nearer to the sea, at Goring, a suburb of Worthing.Looker and Porteous (1965), 198‚Äì202. There, on 14 August 1887, he died of tuberculosis and exhaustion. He is buried in Broadwater and Worthing Cemetery in Worthing. After his death a number of posthumous collections were made of his writings previously published in newspapers and magazines, beginning with Field and Hedgerow (1889), edited by his widow. New collections have appeared since then, but even now not all his writings have been gathered and reprinted. Influence and reputation Early works included three by Henry Stephens Salt: *Richard Jefferies: A Study (1894) *Richard Jefferies: His Life and His Ideas (1905) *The Faith of Richard Jefferies (1906) J. S. Fletcher wrote several novels about English rural life modelled on Jefferies' work,beginning with The Wonderful Wapentake (1894). Jefferies's works inspired Henry Williamson to take up writing ; Williamson edited a collection of Jefferies's writings with a title that indicates the great regard that he held for Jefferies: *Richard Jefferies : Selections of his Work with details of his Life and Circumstances, his Death and Immortality (1947) Other writers who admired Jefferies included David Garnett,D.

The Richard Jefferies Bird Sanctuary in Surbiton commemorates him.Natural England, Local Nature Reserves, The Wood and Richard Jefferies Bird Sanctuary Published books by Jefferies The following list is necessarily selective. Much of Jefferies's writing was not published in book form in his lifetime. Many works surviving in manuscript or only published in journals have been published piecemeal by various editors since his death. Since his contributions to journals were generally anonymous, identification is often a problem. For a fuller survey, see Miller and Matthews (1993). =Books published in Jefferies's lifetime= *The Scarlet Shawl (London: Tinsley Brothers, 1874) *Restless Human Hearts (London: Tinsley Brothers, 1875) *World's End (London: Tinsley Brothers, 1877) *The Gamekeeper at Home (London: Smith, Elder & Co., 1878) (reissued by Cambridge University Press, 2009; ) *Wild Life in a Southern County (London: Smith, Elder & Co., 1879) *The Amateur Poacher (London: Smith, Elder & Co., 1879) (reissued by Cambridge University Press, 2009; ) *Greene Ferne Farm (London: Smith, Elder & Co., 1880) *Hodge and His Masters (London: Smith, Elder & Co., 1880) *Round About a Great Estate (London: Smith, Elder & Co., 1880) *Wood Magic (London: Cassell, Petter, Galpin & Co., 1881) *Bevis: the Story of a Boy (London: Sampson Low, Marston, Searle, & Rivington, 1882) *Nature Near London (London: Chatto & Windus, 1883) *The Story of My Heart: An Autobiography (London: Longmans, Green, & Co., 1883) *Red Deer (London: Longmans, Green, & Co., 1884) *The Life of the Fields (London: Chatto & Windus, 1884) *The Dewy Morn (London: Richard Bentley and Son, 1884) *After London; Or, Wild England (London: Cassell & Company, Ltd., 1885) *The Open Air (London: Chatto & Windus, 1885) *Amaryllis at the Fair (London: Sampson Low, Marston, Searle, & Rivington, 1887) =Posthumous publications= Only the first of these (produced by his widow) was planned by Jefferies. *Field and Hedgerow; Being the Last Essays of Richard Jefferies (London: Longmans, Green, & Co., 1889) *The Toilers in the Field (London: Longmans, Green, & Co., 1892) *The Early Fiction of Richard Jefferies, ed.

Basics Snowmobile watercross consists of crossing water while riding a snowmobile, which is possible because snowmobiles have wide tracks for traction and flotation in the snow. If one hits the water at an acceptable speed (5 mph per 150 lb or km/h per 100 kg of weight) and keeps the sled's throttle open, the track keeps the snowmobile on the surface of the water without sinking.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV8CNw-qQjM If the rider backs out of the throttle or the sled bogs or floods out, the sled will sink. A sunk sled is able to be revived by cleaning water out of the carburetor, exhaust, spark plugs, and replacing the fuel. The front of the sled is pitched upwards as riders commonly do in deep mountain powder snow. History The Grantsburg, Wisconsin first annual World Championship Snowmobile Watercross was held in July 1977 and it has been held yearly on the third week of July since. The first race was simply held to see who could make it the from the island on Memory Lake to the shore. Most didn't, but the winner did go about . In the years following, racers became more skilled and the machines more powerful. Today, racers compete in drags and ovals, with an eight-lap championship run. Over 100 racers compete in the various classes. The Classes range from the beginners' Stock Drags to the top Pro-Open Ovals Class. Competitive watercross is run by two main circuits. The IWA (International Watercross Association) operates mainly in the Midwest, while the EWA (Eastern Watercross Association) operates in the Northeastern States. In most cases, participants in watercross strip their snowmobiles of all non-essential parts‚Äîincluding the seat‚Äîto save weight. On June 25, 2013, Antti Holmberg of Finland set the record for snowmobile skipping at 180 km (112 miles). On September 18, 2015, the record is now set at 212 km (131.731 miles) by the Norwegian Morten Blien.  Safety  Snowmobile skipping right after leaving shore. Note the rider is wearing a life jacket Watercross competitions are held during the summer and the participants of official events don't wear life jackets, and don't have a buoy tethered to their sleds. If for some event the rider and sled do not complete the course, the rider releases the buoy from the snowmobile so that it floats to the surface and marks the sled for retrieval. Watercross competitions, as with other motor sports competitions, have ambulance and rescue crews nearby in the event of an accident. While it is possible to skim over the water with a stock snowmobile, the practice can be dangerous. For example, in February 2006, a Massachusetts man died in New Hampshire after sinking into the water during a failed skimming attempt.http://www.hampton.lib.nh.us/hampton/newspapers/atlanticnews/2006/02-03-2006/Pages05and36.pdf In July 2010, a 40-year-old man died in Anaktuvuk Pass while attempting to skim across Eleanor Lake. In January 2018, a 48-year-old man died after partially skipping across Sturgeon Lake (Ontario).https://www.durhamregion.com/news-story/8085893-opp-say-earl- strong-48-of-courtice-dead-after-snowmobile-enters-open-water/ The practice of \\"skimming\\" is illegal in the states of Minnesota, Maine,http://www.maine.gov/IFW/laws_rules/snowlaws.htm and New Hampshire.https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/pdfs/blk_pdf_NewHampshireLaw.pdf On the contrary, in Wisconsin there are places where skimming is encouraged, and some businesses rely on it to attract customers, for example at Bauer's Dam in Conover, Wisconsin.

A snowmobile, also known as a motor sled, motor sledge, skimobile, snow scooter, Ski-Doo, or snowmachine, is a motorized vehicle designed for winter travel and recreation on snow. It is designed to be operated on snow and ice and does not require a road or trail, but most are driven on open terrain or trails. Snowmobiling is a sport that many people have taken on as a serious hobby. Older snowmobiles could generally accommodate two people; however, most snowmobiles manufactured in the last 25 years have been designed to only accommodate one person. Snowmobiles built with the ability to accommodate two people are referred to as \\"2-up\\" snowmobiles or 'touring' models and make up an extremely small share of the market. Snowmobiles do not have any enclosures, except for a windshield, and their engines normally drive a continuous track at the rear. Skis at the front provide directional control. Early snowmobiles used simple rubber tracks, but modern snowmobiles' tracks are usually made of a Kevlar composite construction. Originally, snowmobiles were powered by two-stroke gasoline internal combustion engines and since the mid-2000s four-stroke engines have also entered the market. The second half of the 20th century saw the rise of recreational snowmobiling, whose riders are called snowmobilers or sledders. Recreational riding is known as snowcross/racing, trail riding, freestyle, boondocking, ditchbanging and grass drags. In the summertime snowmobilers can drag race on grass, asphalt strips, or even across water (see Snowmobile skipping). Snowmobiles are sometimes modified to compete in long- distance off-road races.  Legality  Depending on jurisdiction, there may be penalties for driving outside permitted areas, without an approved helmet, without a drivers license, with an un-registered snowmobile, or while under the influence of alcohol or other substances. There may also be regulations regarding noise and wildlife. = Driver's license = In some jurisdictions, a driver's license is required to operate snowmobile. A specific snowmobile driver's license is required in for example Norway and Sweden. In Finland, a snowmobile driver's license is not required if the driver already has another type of appropriate driver's license (for example car or tractor).  Early history  Harry Kalenze, inventor of the Vehicle Propeller In 1911 a 24 year old, Harold J. Kalenze (pronounced Collins), patented the Vehicle Propeller in Brandon, Manitoba, Canada. In 1915 Ray H. Muscott of Waters, Michigan, received the Canadian patent for his motor sleigh, or \\"traineau automobile\\", and on June 27, 1916, he received the first United States patent for a snow- vehicle using the now recognized format of rear track(s) and front skis. Many individuals later modified Ford Model Ts with the undercarriage replaced by tracks and skis following this design. They were popular for rural mail delivery for a time. The common name for these conversion of cars and small trucks was Snowflyers.\\"Snowflyers Replace Dogs in Frozen North\\" Popular Mechanics, December 1934 1921 Ford Model T snowmobileIn 1935 Joseph Bombardier assembled and successfully tested the first snowmobile. It was a vehicle with a sprocket wheel and a track drive system, and it was steered by skis. CoandƒÉ ducted fan Snowmobile running on the Mississippi River near Hastings, Minnesota, 1910 The challenges of cross-country transportation in the winter led to the invention of the snowmobile, an all-terrain vehicle specifically designed for travel across deep snow where other vehicles foundered. During the 20th century, rapidly evolving designs produced machines that were two- person tracked vehicles powered by gas engines that enabled them to tow a sled or travel, initially at low-to-moderate speeds, depending on snow conditions, terrain and obstacles protruding above the snow like brush and trees. Where early designs had two-stroke engines, there has been a move toward newer style two and four-stroke gasoline engines, some with over .  Multi-passenger snowmobiles  Nicholas II Packard Twin-6 with K√©gresse track The origin of the snowmobile is not the work of any one inventor but more a process of advances in engines for the propulsion of vehicles and supporting devices over snow. It parallels the development of the automobile and later aviation, often inventors using the same components for a different use. Wisconsinites experimented with over-snow vehicles before 1900, experimenting with bicycles equipped with runners and gripping fins; steam-propelled sleighs; and (later) Model T Fords converted with rear tractor treads and skis in front. A patent (554.482) for the Sled-Propeller design, without a model, was submitted on Sept. 5, 1895 by inventors William J. Culman and William B. Follis of Brule, Wisconsin.Official Gazette of the United States Patent Office United States. Page 778. January 1, 1896; U.S. Patent Office. In the first races held near Three Lakes in 1926, 104 of these \\"snowbuggies\\" started. Carl Eliason of Sayner developed the prototype of the modern snowmobile in the 1920s when he mounted a two-cylinder motorcycle engine on a long sled, steered it with skis under the front, and propelled it with single, endless track. Eliason made 40 snowmobiles, patented in 1927. Upon receiving an order for 200 from Finland, he sold his patent to the FWD Company of Clintonville. They made 300 for military use, then transferred the patent to a Canadian subsidiary. The American Motor Sleigh was a short-lived novelty vehicle produced in Boston in 1905. Designed for travel on snow, it consisted of a sleigh body mounted on a framework that held an engine, a drive-shaft system, and runners. Although considered an interesting novelty, sales were low and production ceased in 1906. The Aerosani, propeller-driven and running on skis, was built in 1909‚Äì1910 by Russian inventor Igor Sikorsky of helicopter fame. Aerosanis were used by the Soviet Red Army during the Winter War and World War II. There is some dispute over whether Aerosanis count as snowmobiles because they were not propelled by tracks.On this site, they tell you to go to Snowmobile when you search for Aerosani Adolphe K√©gresse designed an original caterpillar tracks system, called the K√©gresse track, while working for Tsar Nicholas II of Russia between 1906 and 1916. These used a flexible belt rather than interlocking metal segments and could be fitted to a conventional car or truck to turn it into a half-track, suitable for use over soft ground, including snow. Conventional front wheels and steering were used but the wheel could be fitted with skis as seen in the upper right image. He applied it to several cars in the Royal garage including Rolls-Royce cars and Packard trucks. Although this was not a snowmobile, it is an ancestor of the modern concept. Bombardier Snowmobile Early snowmobile interior Airplane-engine-powered skimobile taxi in Red Lake, Canada, 1937 The relatively dry snow conditions of the United States Midwest suited the converted Ford Model Ts and other like vehicles, but they were not suitable for humid snow areas such as southern Quebec and New England. This led Joseph-Armand Bombardier from the small town of Valcourt, Quebec, to invent a different caterpillar track system suitable for all kinds of snow conditions. Bombardier had already made some \\"metal\\" tracked vehicles since 1928, but his new revolutionary track traction system (a toothed wheel covered in rubber, and a rubber-and-cotton track that wraps around the back wheels) was his first major invention. He started production of the B-7, an enclosed, seven-passenger snowmobile, in 1937, and introduced the B-12, a twelve-passenger model, in 1942. The B-7 had a V-8 flathead engine from Ford Motor Company. The B-12 had a flathead in line six-cylinder engine from Chrysler industrial, and 2,817 units were produced until 1951. It was used in many applications, such as ambulances, Canada Post vehicles, winter \\"school buses\\", forestry machines, and even army vehicles in World War II. Bombardier had always dreamed of a smaller version, more like the size of a motor scooter.   A snowmobile used by emergency services in ski areas in Vercors, French Alps. It carries emergency equipment and tows a stretcher. Snow mobile race in 1979, Dutch newsreel =Early models= Numerous people had ideas for a smaller personal snowmobile. In 1914, O. M. Erickson and Art Olsen of the P.N. Bushnell company in Aberdeen, South Dakota, built an open two-seater \\"motor-bob\\" out of an Indian motorcycle modified with a cowl-cover, side-by-side seating, and a set of sled-runners fore and aft. While it did not have the tracks of a true snowmobile, its appearance was otherwise similar to the modern version and is one of the earliest examples of a personal motorized snow-vehicle.Aberdeen American News 1914-02-04 In 1951 Dr. Fritz Riemerschmid devised what he called a snow scooter. The machine had a track mounted beneath a snowboard like base, on top of which were an enclosed engine with motorcycle like seat and fuel tank. the vehicle was steered via a steering wheel and cables linked to two small skis on outriggers either side of the vehicle. In the mid-1950s, a United States firm built a \\"snowmobile the arctic area of Alaska that had the drive train reversed of today's snowmobiles with two front wheels--the larger one behind the smaller one--with tires driving an endless loop track\\". Little is known about this \\"snowmobile\\" meant to haul cargo and trade goods to isolated settlements.\\"American Snowmobile Ends Need for Dogs in Arctic.\\" Popular Mechanics, March 1954, p. 114 =Polaris= Edgar and Allen Hetteen and David Johnson of Roseau, Minnesota, invented what we now know as the modern snowmobile in 1955‚Äì1956, but the early machines were heavy () and slow (). Their company, Hetteen Hoist & Derrick Co., became Polaris Industries which introduced their first commercial model, the Polaris Sno Traveler in 1957. =BRP= In 1960, Joseph-Armand Bombardier introduced his own snowmobile using an open-cockpit one- or two-person form, similar to the 1957 Polaris Sno Traveler, and started selling it under the brand name Ski-Doo through his company Bombardier Inc. (now manufactured by Bombardier Recreational Products). Competitors copied and improved his design; in the 1970s there were over a hundred snowmobile manufacturers. From 1970 to 1973, two million machines were sold, peaking at 500,000 sold in 1971. Many of the snowmobile companies were small and the biggest manufacturers were often attempts by motorcycle makers and outboard motor makers to branch off in a new market. Most of these companies went bankrupt or were acquired by larger companies during the 1973 oil crisis and succeeding recessions. Sales rebounded to 260,000 in 1997 but gradually decreased afterwards, influenced by warmer winters and the use during all four seasons of small one- or two-person ATVs. =Alpina= Alpina Snowmobiles are manufactured in Vicenza, Italy, by Alpina s.r.l., a manufacturer of various on-snow implements that had been building dual-track snowmobiles since 1995.Alpina s.r.l. There are two manufacturers of dual-track snowmobiles. One is Alpina and the other is a Russian sled called Buran (Bombardier discontinued manufacturing its dual- track model, the Elite, in 2005). ;Models Alpina manufactures one basic dual- track snowmobile design. In 2002 the Sherpa was introduced and is the model name for the four-stroke machine. Prior to introducing the Sherpa, Alpina offered a two-stroke series designated the Superclass. The four-stroke Sherpa is currently the top machine in production. A new version of the Superclass has been released in 2017, with a lot of innovations and a new four-stroke engine. The Sherpa and Superclass series shared the same basic dual-track platform, twin tracks with dual skis up front. Alpina Sherpa, a dual track snowmobile Power for the Sherpa is supplied by a 1.6L in-line four-cylinder gasoline automotive engine. The new Superclass power is provided by a 1.2L 3-cylinder four-stroke gasoline engine. ;Features The Sherpa and Superclass are designed as working snowmobiles for carrying supplies, pulling cargo sleds, pulling trail grooming implements, carrying several passengers, and negotiating deep snow. Engine and transmission combination are designed to deliver optimum power to pull or carry large loads while top-end speeds are kept below , depending on the model. The large footprint of the dual tracks and dual skis allows the Sherpa and Superclass to \\"float\\" on top of deep snow and not sink in and get stuck. =Taiga Electric= Taiga Motors in Montreal created the first commercially produced electric snowmobile. The Taiga TS2 can go from zero to in 3 seconds, with of instant torque. At , the Taiga TS2 is one of the lightest in the industry. Maintains a range of even down past . Direct drive, no transmission. Integrated GPS for easy course mapping & accurate range estimation. DC quick charge (20 min) option. Different options are available for utility, touring, crossover and mountain machines. Current markets , the snowmobile market has been shared between the four large North American makers (Bombardier Recreational Products (BRP), Arctic Cat, Yamaha, and Polaris) and some specialized makers like the Quebec-based AD Boivin, manufacturer of the Snow Hawk and the European Alpina snowmobile. Higher- powered modern snowmobiles can achieve speeds in excess of . Drag racing snowmobiles can reach speeds in excess of . Snowmobiles are widely used in arctic territories for travel. However, the small Arctic population means a correspondingly small market. Most snowmobiles are sold for recreational purposes, in places where snow cover is stable during winter. The number of snowmobiles in Europe and other parts of the world is low, but growing. Snowmobiles designed to perform various work tasks have been available for many years with dual tracks from such manufacturers as Aktiv (Sweden), who made the Grizzly, Ockelbo (Sweden), who made the 8000, and Bombardier who made the Alpine and later the Alpine II. Currently there are two manufacturers of dual-track snowmobiles; Russia's Buran and the Italian Alpina snowmobiles (under the name Sherpa and Superclass). An odd version of snowmobile is the Swedish Larven, made by the Lenko Company of √ñstersund, from the 1960s until the end of the 1980s. It was a very small and basic design, with just an engine in the rear and a track. The driver sat on it and steered using skis on his feet. Propulsion Most modern snowmobiles are powered by either a four- or two-stroke internal combustion engine, with the exception of the Taiga TS2. Historically, snowmobiles have always used two-stroke engines because of their reduced complexity, weight and cost, compared to a similarly powered four- stroke. However, four-stroke powered snowmobiles have been gaining popularity steadily in the last fifteen or so years, with manufacturer Yamaha producing four-stroke snowmobiles only. The Whistler Blackcomb ski resort is testing Taiga's electric snowmobiles with lower noise, and similar vehicles exist. Performance The first snowmobiles made do with as little as engines, but engine sizes and efficiency have improved drastically. In the early 1990s, the biggest engines available (typically 600cc-800cc displacement range) produced around . As of 2010, several snowmobiles are available with engines sizes up to 1,200 cc, producing 150+ hp, as well as several models with up to 1,000 cc engines producing closer to . Recently, some models are turbo-charged, resulting in dramatic increase of engine horsepower. Snowmobiles are capable of moving across steep hillsides without sliding down-slope if the rider transfers their weight towards the uphill side, a process called side-hilling. Mountain sleds permit access in remote areas with deep snow, which was nearly impossible a few decades ago. This is mainly due to alterations, enhancements, and additions of original trail model designs such as weight, weight distribution, track length, paddle depth, and power. Technology and design advances in mountain snowmobiles have improved since 2003 with Ski-Doo's introduction of the \\"REV\\" framework platform. Most two-stroke mountain snowmobiles have a top engine size of 800 cc, producing around , although some 1,000 cc factory machines have been produced. These may not be as popular as many 800 cc models outperform them because of weight and an increase of unneeded power. Cornices and other kinds of jumps are sought after for aerial maneuvers. Riders often search for non-tracked, virgin terrain and are known to \\"trailblaze\\" or \\"boondock\\" deep into remote territory where there is absolutely no visible path to follow. However, this type of trailblazing is dangerous as contact with buried rocks, logs, and frozen ground can cause extensive damage and injuries. Riders look for large open fields of fresh snow where they can carve. Some riders use extensively modified snowmobiles, customized with aftermarket accessories like handle-bar risers, handguards, custom/lightweight hoods, windshields, and seats, running board supports, studs, and numerous other modifications that increase power and maneuverability. Many of these customizations can now be purchased straight off the showroom floor on stock models. Trail snowmobiles improved in the past 15 years as well (many of them borrowed from endeavors to produce winning mountain sleds). Heavy \\"muscle sleds\\" can produce speeds in excess of due to powerful engines (up to 1,200 cc stock, and custom engines exceeding 1,200 cc), short tracks, and good traction on groomed trails. Sno-cross oriented snowmobiles often have an engine size cap of 440 or 600 cc, but lighter machines with redesigned stances, formats, and weight control have produced extremely fast and quickly accelerating race sleds. Environmental impact The environmental impact of snowmobiles has been the subject of much debate. Governments have been reacting slowly to noise and air pollution, partly because of lobbying from manufacturers and snowmobilers. For instance, in 1999, the Canadian government adopted the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, but the set of rules governing pollution emissions for off-road vehicles was only released in January 2005. In another example of regulation, only four-stroke snowmobiles are allowed in Yellowstone National Park since a bylaw was recently passed to minimize CO2 emissions and noise. In Yellowstone, snowmobiles account for 80% of total hydrocarbon emissions and 50% of carbon monoxide emissions in the winter. This is just less than 2% and 1% respectively of the overall annual pollution within the park. Snowmobiles are only allowed to be ridden on the unplowed roads used in the summer, and riding off the roads is prohibited. This accounts for less than 1% (0.002%) of the park area. In 2005 the US Forest Service published a Travel Management Rule36 CFR Parts 212, 251, 261, and 295. Travel Management; Designated Routes and Areas for Motor Vehicle Use; Final Rule. for off-highway vehicles, strengthening the implementation of Executive Orders issued in the 1970s. However, these rules were not applied to snowmobiles. In 2015, following a decision in a lawsuit brought by Winter Wildlands Alliance against the Forest Service, the rules were extended to snowmobiles.Powder Struggle: Federal Judge orders snomobile regulations, John Miller & Todd Dvorak, Associated Press, 1 April 2013 National Forests with sufficient snow for winter recreation are now required to designate where OSVs are allowed to travel and where they are prohibited.Use By Over-Snow Vehicles (Travel Management Rule). In doing so, the Forest Service must minimize 1) damage to soil, watershed, vegetation, and other forest resources; 2) harassment of wildlife and significant disruption of wildlife habitats; and 3) conflicts between motor vehicle use and existing or proposed recreational uses of National Forest System lands or neighboring Federal lands. = Air = RIT 2017. Most snowmobiles are still powered by two-stroke engines, although Alpina and Yamaha have been using four-strokes since 2002 and 2003, respectively. However, in the last decade several manufacturers have been successful in designing less polluting motors, and putting most of them in production. Yamaha and Arctic-Cat were the first to mass-produce four-stroke models, which are significantly less polluting than the early two-stroke machines. Alpina offers only four-stroke EFI engines equipped with a catalytic converter and dual oxygen-probe. Bombardier's E-Tec two-stroke motors emit 85% less pollutants than previous carbureted two- strokes. Polaris has developed a fuel-injection technology called \\"Cleanfire Injection\\" on their two-strokes. The industry is also working on a direct- injected \\"clean two strokes\\" that is better in terms of NOX emissions. Independent researchers, undergraduates and graduate students participate in contests to lessen the impact of emissions from snowmobiles. The Clean Snow Mobile Challenge is held yearly at Michigan Technological University regrouping the entries from universities from across United States and Canada. Some of the participants in recent years have been the √âcole polytechnique de Montr√©al with a Quasiturbine engine and students from √âcole de technologie sup√©rieure of the UQAM with a less polluting two-stroke engine using E85 and direct injection. = Noise = Maximum noise restrictions have been enacted by law for both production of snowmobiles and aftermarket components. For instance, in Quebec (Canada) noise levels must be 78 decibels or less at 20 meters from a snowmobile path. As of 2009, snowmobiles produce 90% less noise than in the 1960s but there are still numerous complaints. Efforts to reduce noise focus on suppressing mechanical noise of the suspension components and tracks. Arctic Cat in 2005 introduced \\"Silent Track technology\\" on touring models such as the T660 Turbo, Bearcat, and some M-Series sleds. Ski-Doo has since then also used comparative \\"silent track technology\\" on some models. The use of aftermarket exhaust systems (\\"cans\\" or \\"silencers\\") is controversial. These replace the stock muffler with a less restrictive system that is usually claimed to increase power output of the engine. However, these aftermarket exhausts are often much louder than those from the factory, with only some being slightly quieter than a completely open, unbaffled system. Most, if not all, local snowmobile clubs (that maintain and groom trail systems) do not recommend them because of noise. Local and state authorities have set up checkpoints on high-traffic trails, checking for excessively loud systems and issuing citations. Typically these systems are installed on two-stroke powered machines (giving the distinctive \\"braap\\" sound); however, in recent years aftermarket companies have released silencers for four-stroke models as well. Importance in isolated communities Since the invention of snowmobiles, isolated communities of northern North America have always had a demand for them. However, the early snowmobiles designs were not economical or functional enough for the harsh environment of northern North America. Joseph-Armand Bombardier started producing the Ski-Doo in 1959 at the request of a priest. The priest had asked Bombardier to make an economical and reliable means of winter travel. The Ski-Doo greatly changed life in northern North America's isolated communities, where Ski-Doo replaced sled dogs by the end of the 1960s. The Ski-Doo also greatly improved communication between isolated communities. Snowmobiles are also called \\"Snow Machines‚Äù in some areas of Alaska. =Work= In northern North America, historically, isolated communities depended on dog sledding and snowshoeing as their primary method of transportation for hunting during the winter months. The Ski-Doo allowed trappers to travel greater distances faster, allowing them to expand their hunting grounds. Prospectors, mining companies, foresters, backcountry cabin owners, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian Army also found snowmobiles very effective because they were the most economical method of transportation of small loads. =Recreation= Martin Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada for a winter picnic in February. Joseph-Armand Bombardier's tests of Ski-Dog proved that snowmobiling was fun, and snowmobiling became a new form of outdoor recreation. People who once sat dormant throughout winter were now given the opportunity in more outdoor activities. Economic impact Snowmobiles are used by reindeer herders According to the International Snowmobile Manufacturers Association, snowmobilers in Canada and the United States spend over $28 billion on snowmobiling each year. This includes expenditures on equipment, clothing, accessories, snowmobiling vacations (lodging, fuel, and food), maintenance and others. Often this is the only source of income for some smaller towns, such as Bralorne, British Columbia, that rely solely on tourism during the summer and winter months. Once a booming gold mining town, Bralorne is now a very small town with a population of 60, and it is relatively inaccessible by car in the winter. The economy relies on visits from snowmobilers, who contribute to the economy by spending money on gas, food, and hotels. Accidents and safety As a result of their inherent maneuverability, acceleration, and high-speed abilities, both skill and physical strength are required to operate a snowmobile. Snowmobile injuries and fatalities are high compared to those caused by on road motor vehicle traffic. Losing control of a snowmobile could easily cause extensive damage, injury, or death. One such cause of snowmobile accidents is loss of control from a loose grip. If the rider falls off, the loss of control can easily result in the snowmobile colliding with a nearby object, such as a rock or tree. Most snowmobiles are fitted with a cord connected to a kill switch, which would stop the snowmobile if the rider falls off; however, not all riders use this device every time they operate a snowmobile. Swerving off of the path may result in rolling the snowmobile or crashing into an obstacle. In unfamiliar areas, riders may crash into suspended barbed wire or haywire fences at high speeds. Each year a number of serious or fatal accidents are caused by these factors. Each year, riders are killed by hitting other snowmobiles, automobiles, pedestrians, rocks, trees, or fences, or falling through thin ice. On average, 10 people a year have died in such crashes in Minnesota alone, with alcohol a contributing factor in many cases. In Saskatchewan, 16 out of 21 deaths in snowmobile collisions between 1996 and 2000 were caused by the effects of alcohol. Wrestler Lindsey Durlacher died in 2011 following surgery for a broken sternum he sustained in a snowmobile accident. Fatal collisions with trains can also occur when a snowmobile operator engages in the illegal practice of \\"rail riding\\", riding between railroad track rails over snow-covered sleepers. Inability to hear the sound of an oncoming train over the engine noise of a snowmobile makes this activity extremely dangerous. Collision with large animals such as moose and deer, which may venture onto a snowmobile trail, is another major cause of snowmobile accidents. Most often such encounters occur at night or in low- visibility conditions when the animal could not be seen in time to prevent a collision. Also even when successful, a sudden maneuver to miss hitting the animal could still result in the operator losing control of the snowmobile. A large number of snowmobile deaths in Alaska are caused by drowning. Because of the cold weather in many parts of Alaska, the rivers and lakes are generally frozen over during certain times of the year in winter. People who ride early or late in the season run the risk of falling through weak ice, and heavy winter clothing can make it extremely difficult to escape the frozen water. While a snowmobile is heavy, it also distributes its weight at a larger area than a standing person, so a driver who has stopped his vehicle out on the ice of a frozen lake can go through the ice just by stepping off the snowmobile. The next leading cause of injury and death is avalanches, which can result from the practice of highmarking, or driving a snowmobile as far up a hill as it can go. During the 2018‚Äì2019 season, 7 snowmobilers in the United States were killed. Avalanche safety education is critical for those accessing the backcountry. Risks can be reduced through education, proper training, appropriate gear, attention to published avalanche warnings and avoiding drinking alcohol. In some areas of Western U.S., organizations provide avalanche training, some of which is free. It is recommended that snowmobile riders wear a helmet and a snowmobile suit. Types of races Snowmobile race * The International 500 is a large racing event held annually in Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan. It is a race on a track, with the current purse being in excess of $40,000. It has been running since February 1969. * Drag racing is common with snowmobiles year-round, with summer and fall often with grass or closed-course (asphalt or concrete) drag strips. The largest event is Hay Days in North Branch, Minnesota, on the first weekend following Labor Day. * The World Championship Watercross or snowmobile skipping races are held in Grantsburg, Wisconsin, in July. The snowmobiles are raced on a marked course, similar to motocross courses, without the ramps and on water. * The Snocross racing series are snowmobile races on a motocross-like course. The races are held during the winter season in Northern United States and Canada. One of the largest in New York is the Northeast SnoX Challenge in early January in Malone, New York, and run by Rock Maple Racing and sponsored by the Malone Chamber of Commerce. * Snowmobiles are used for ice racing. The racing is held on an \\"Ice Oval\\" track. The World Championship Snowmobile Derby is held each winter in Eagle River, Wisconsin. * Alaska's \\"Iron Dog\\" is the longest snowmachine race in the world. It is long and runs from Big Lake to Nome to Fairbanks. The name refers to dog mushing, long popular in Alaska. * Vintage Snowmobile Racing is the racing of vintage snowmobiles and has grown in popularity as a sporting event on the Canadian prairie and in America. * The World Championship Hill Climb competition is held in Jackson, Wyoming, at the Snow King Mountain resort each year in March. 2019 was the 43rd year of the four-day event and drew around 10,000 in attendance.

The concept of Lila is common to both non-dualist and dualist philosophical schools of Indian philosophy, but has a markedly different significance in each. Within non-dualism, Lila is a way of describing all reality, including the cosmos, as the outcome of creative play by the divine absolute (Brahman). In the dualistic schools of Vaishnavism, Lila refers to the activities of God and his devotee, as well as the macrocosmic actions of the manifest universe, as seen in the Vaishnava scripture Srimad Bhagavatam, verse 3.26.4:Vedabase entry SB 3.26.4 > sa e·π£a prak·πõti·∏ø s≈´k·π£mƒÅ·∏ø > daivƒ´·∏ø gu·πáamayƒ´·∏ø vibhu·∏• > yad·πõcchayaivopagatƒÅm > abhyapadyata lƒ´layƒÅ > > \\"As His pastimes, that Supreme Personality of Godhead, the greatest of the > great, accepted the subtle material energy, which is invested with three > material modes of nature.\\" Modern interpretations Implications Hindu denominations differ on how a human should react to awareness of Lila. Karma Yoga allows a joyful embrace of all aspects of life (\\"intentional acceptance\\") while maintaining distinction from the Supreme, while Bhakti and Jnana Yoga advocate striving for oneness with the Supreme. Lila is an important idea in the traditional worship of Krishna (as prankster) and Shiva (as dancer), and has been used by modern writers like Stephen Nachmanovitch, Fritjof Capra, and Alan Watts. Lila is comparable to the Western theological position of Pandeism, which describes the Universe as God taking a physical form in order to experience the interplay between the elements of the Universe.James B.

Each of the Quartering Acts was an amendment to the Mutiny Act and required annual renewal by Parliament.William Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents, 19-20 (2d ed., Government Printing Office 1920); \\"Quartering Act.\\" They were originally intended as a response to issues that arose during the French and Indian War and soon became a source of tensions between the inhabitants of the Thirteen Colonies and the government in London. These tensions would later lead toward the American Revolution. Quartering Act 1765 General Thomas Gage, commander-in-chief of forces in British North America, and other British officers who had fought in the French and Indian War (including Major James Robertson), had found it hard to persuade colonial assemblies to pay for quartering and provisioning of troops on the march. Therefore, he asked Parliament to do something. Most colonies had supplied provisions during the war, but the issue was disputed in peacetime. The Province of New York was their headquarters, because the assembly had passed an Act to provide for the quartering of British regulars, but it expired on January 2, 1764,Kammen, pg. 355 The result was the Quartering Act 1765, which went far beyond what Gage had requested. No standing army had been kept in the colonies before the French and Indian War, so the colonies asked why a standing army was needed after the French had been defeated in battle. This first Quartering Act5 Geo. III, c. 33. was given Royal Assent on May 15, 1765,Gordon Wood, The American Revolution (New York: Random House, 2002). and provided that Great Britain would house its soldiers in American barracks and public houses, as by the Mutiny Act 1765, but if its soldiers outnumbered the housing available, would quarter them in \\"inns, livery stables, ale houses, victualing houses, and the houses of sellers of wine and houses of persons selling of rum, brandy, strong water, cider or metheglin\\", and if numbers required in \\"uninhabited houses, outhouses, barns, or other buildings.\\" Colonial authorities were required to pay the cost of housing and feeding these soldiers. When 1,500 British troops arrived at New York City in 1766 the New York Provincial Assembly refused to comply with the Quartering Act and did not supply billeting for the troops. The troops had to remain on their ships. With its great impact on the city, a skirmish occurred in which one colonist was wounded following the Assembly's refusal to provide quartering. For failure to comply with the Quartering Act, Parliament suspended the Province of New York's Governor and legislature in 1767 and 1769, but never carried it out, since the Assembly soon agreed to contribute money toward the quartering of troops; America During the Age of Revolution, 1766-1767, Library of Congress the New York Assembly allocated funds for the quartering of British troops in 1771. The Quartering Act was circumvented in all colonies other than Pennsylvania. This act expired on March 24, 1776.  Quartering Act 1774  The Quartering Act 1774 was known as one of the Coercive Acts in Great Britain, and as part of the intolerable acts in the colonies. The Quartering Act applied to all of the colonies, and sought to create a more effective method of housing British troops in America. In a previous act, the colonies had been required to provide housing for soldiers, but colonial legislatures had been uncooperative in doing so. The new Quartering Act allowed a governor to house soldiers in other buildings if suitable quarters were not provided. While many sources claim that the Quartering Act allowed troops to be billeted in occupied private homes, historian David Ammerman's 1974 study claimed that this is a myth, and that the act only permitted troops to be quartered in unoccupied buildings.  Quartering: in time of War  During the French and Indian War Britain had forcibly seized quarters in private dwellings.Anderson, p. 649 In the American Revolutionary War, the New York Provincial Congress barracked Continental Army troops in private homes.Schecter, pg. 90 The Americans strongly opposed the quartering of British troops in their homes because the British Parliament had created the Mutiny Act under which the British army was supposed to be prohibited against quartering troops in private homes of citizens against their will. Although Parliament passed these laws in 1723, 1754, and 1756 the British Army ignored them in the Colonies. Because of this violation of their rights the colonies believed that liberty itself would be destroyed. Along with the fear of a loss of liberty, the colonists felt that the British army should be subordinate to civil authority since Parliament already stated that the army couldn't force quartering through the Mutiny Act.Rogers, pg. 7 With the growing worries of illegal quartering by the British, the Pennsylvania Assembly met and denied any quartering bill that guaranteed citizens could deny soldiers to stay in private homes. When the Assembly finally passed the quartering bill, the passage stating how soldiers could or could not be quartered in homes was omitted and it only outlined how the soldiers were to be quartered in public houses. That winter's harsh conditions led the British commander, Col. Henry Bouquet, to order the colonists to quarter his troops in other places than just private homes. Bouquet felt his troops couldn't survive the winter without better living conditions. Bouquet wrote a letter to the governor of Pennsylvania telling him to issue a warrant to allow the quartering of his troops in private homes. The governor issued the warrant but left it blank instead of directly listing what Col. Bouquet could or could not do. The Pennsylvania Assembly was outraged when they learned what their governor had done. But instead of asking for a veto on the warrant they asked for a review on how many troops could be quartered in a single home at a time. But the only response they received was that the king's troops must and will be quartered. In response to this the Assembly met on a Sunday for the first time. There they wrote a letter to the governor asking why their constitutional rights were being violated when The British Parliament laws favored the colonists.Rogers, pg. 8 In response to what was happening to the colonists, Benjamin Franklin opened up an Assembly meeting suggesting that soldiers could be quartered in public houses in the suburbs. This meant instead of the troops be directly in the city they would be in houses on the outskirts of the city on farms where they could potentially have more space. Governor Denny attended this Pennsylvania meeting and bluntly answered that the commander in chief, Lord Loudoun, had requested quartering for the troops in Philadelphia and if anybody had a problem with this then they should talk to him. The committeemen brought to light that they felt Denny was siding with the British military when instead as governor he should work to protect the rights of the colonists. The ongoing quarrel between State Assembly, governor, and Lord Loudoun wasn't a dispute between legislature and executive powers; but a contest for political liberty. The colonists had the same rights through British Parliament laws but they were not granted to them and instead threatened by bayonets for personal gain. In Albany, New York the mayor had allocated $1,000 for the building of barracks for Loudoun's troops, but the barracks had not been built by the time the troops arrived. The mayor told Loudoun that he knew his rights and refused to let the troops be quartered in Albany. When the mayor stayed adamant on his beliefs of not allowing the troops to be quartered, Loudoun had them forcefully apply themselves in private homes. In an early August committee meeting in Boston, Massachusetts, the governor was able to get the committee to pass a bill to grant money for the building of barracks. These barracks would accommodate up to one thousand troops. The barracks were built and all that had to be done was convince Loudoun to obey the procedures set by parliament. Everything went smoothly until two recruiting officers complained to governor Pawnall of Massachusetts that they were denied quarters in Boston. The response was that it was illegal to quarter in private homes in Boston and the committeemen suggested that they stay at the newly built barracks at Castle William. The timing of this new meeting with Lord Loudoun was extremely unfortunate. He was currently suffering losses in northern New York while trying to hold off the French and Indians. When he heard of what happened with the committeemen he argued that the current military crisis made it acceptable to quarter troops in private homes. A bill was then brought to the governor to sign that said troops could be quartered in homes but innkeepers had the right to complain to a judge if they felt too many soldiers were there. Loudoun was enraged with this and threatened to force troops upon civilians again. By the end of December, the Massachusetts legislature was able to get Loudoun to agree to quarter his troops at Castle William, which meant through the long process the colonists, were able to uphold their legal rights.Rogers, pg. 9 On May 3, 1765 the British Parliament met and finally passed a Quartering Act for the Americans. The act stated that troops could only be quartered in barracks and if there wasn't enough space in barracks then they were to be quartered in public houses and inns. If still not enough space then the governor and council were to find vacant space, but at no time was it legal to quarter troops in private homes.Rogers, pg. 10 Modern relevance A section of the United States Declaration of Independence listing the colonies' grievances against the King explicitly notes: The Third Amendment to the United States Constitution, expressly prohibited the military from peacetime quartering of troops without consent of the owner of the house. A product of their times, the relevance of the Acts and the Third Amendment has greatly declined since the era of the American Revolution, having been the subject of only one case in over 200 years, Engblom v. Carey in 1982. The Quartering Act was one of the reasons for the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibits infringing on the right of the people to keep and bear arms. Standing armies were mistrusted, and the First Congress considered quartering of troops to have been one of the tools of oppression before and during the American revolution.

III. c. 19 which became law on March 31, 1774, and took effect on June 1, 1774. It was one of five measures (variously called the Intolerable Acts, the Punitive Acts or the Coercive Acts) that were enacted during the spring of 1774 to punish Boston for the Boston Tea Party.  Background  Satirical image depicting Thomas Gage feeding fish to imprisoned Bostonian citizens. The Act was a response to the Boston Tea Party. King George III's speech of 7 March 1774 charged the colonists with attempting to injure British commerce and subvert the constitution. On 18 March, Lord North brought in the Port Bill, which outlawed the use of the Port of Boston (by setting up a barricade/blockade) for \\"landing and discharging, loading or shipping, of goods, wares, and merchandise\\" until restitution was made to the King's treasury (for customs duty lost) and to the East India Company for damages suffered. In other words, it closed Boston Port to all ships, no matter what business the ship had. It also provided that Massachusetts Colony's seat of government should be moved to Salem and Marblehead made a port of entry. The Act was to take effect on June 1. Passage Even some of the strongest allies of America in Parliament at first approved the Act as moderate and reasonable and argued that the town could end the punishment at any time by paying for the merchandise destroyed in the riot and allowing law and order to have their course. However, the Whig opposition soon collected itself, and the bill was fought in its various stages by Edmund Burke, Isaac Barr√©, Thomas Pownall and others. In spite of them, the Act became a law the 31 of March, without a division in the Commons and by a unanimous vote in the Lords. Aftermath Royal Navy warships subsequently began patrols at the mouth of Boston Harbor to enforce the acts. The British Army also joined in enforcing the blockade, and Boston was filled with troops, Thomas Gage, commander-in- chief. Colonists protested that the Port Act penalized thousands of residents and violated their rights as subjects of George III. As the Port of Boston was a major source of supplies for the citizens of Massachusetts, sympathetic colonies as far away as South Carolina sent relief supplies to the settlers of Massachusetts Bay. So great was the response that the Boston leaders boasted that the town would become the chief grain port of America unless the act was not repealed. June 1 was widely observed as a day of fasting and prayer, bells being tolled, flags placed at half-mast, and houses draped in mourning. That was the first step in the unification of the thirteen colonies since they now had a cause for which to work together. The First Continental Congress was convened in Philadelphia on September 5, 1774 to co-ordinate a colonial response to the Port Act and the other Coercive Acts.Ciment (2016), p. 684.

The descendants of Aaron, who was the first kohen gadol (high priest) of Israel, were designated as the priestly class, the Kohanim. Levite reading the law to the Israelites (1873 drawing) The Tribe of Levi served particular religious duties for the Israelites and had political responsibilities as well. In return, the landed tribes were expected to give tithes to the Kohanim, the priests working in the Temple in Jerusalem, particularly the tithe known as the Maaser Rishon. The Levites who were not Kohanim played music in the Temple or served as guards. When Joshua led the Israelites into the land of Canaan the Levites were the only Israelite tribe that received cities but were not allowed to be landowners, because \\"the Lord God of Israel is their inheritance, as he said to them\\" (Book of Joshua, ). Notable descendants of the Levite lineage according to the Bible include Moses, Aaron, Miriam, Samuel, Ezekiel, Ezra, and Malachi. In the Bible =In the Torah= According to the Torah, the tribe is named after Levi, one of the twelve sons of Jacob (also called Israel). Levi had three sons: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari (). Kohath's son Amram was the father of Miriam, Aaron and Moses. The descendants of Aaron, the Kohanim, had the special role as priests in the Tabernacle in the wilderness and also in the Temple in Jerusalem. The remaining Levites were divided into three groups: Gershonites (descended from Gershon), Kohathites (from Kohath), and Merarites (from Merari). Each division filled different roles in the Tabernacle and later in the Temple services. Levites' principal roles in the Temple included singing Psalms during Temple services, performing construction and maintenance for the Temple, serving as guards, and performing other services. Levites also served as teachers and judges, maintaining cities of refuge in biblical times. The Book of Ezra reports that the Levites were responsible for the construction of the Second Temple and also translated and explained the Torah when it was publicly read. During the Exodus the Levite tribe were particularly zealous in protecting the Mosaic law in the face of those worshipping the golden calf, which may have been a reason for their priestly status.From quoting This is despite Aaron initiating the creation and worship of the golden calf. [Exodus 32:4-6] Although the Levites were not counted in the census among the children of Israel, they were numbered separately as a special army.Ginzberg, Louis (1909). The Legends of the Jews Vol III : The Census of Levites (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society. Numbers 35:4-5) Benjamin. Note the area around the cities allotted to the Levites, per Numbers 35:4‚Äì5 In the Book of Numbers the Levites were charged with ministering to the Kohanim and keeping watch over the Tabernacle: :2 And with you bring your brother also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, that they may join you and minister to you while you and your sons with you are before the tent of the testimony.3 They shall keep guard over you and over the whole tent, but shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary or to the altar lest they, and you, die.4 They shall join you and keep guard over the tent of meeting for all the service of the tent, and no outsider shall come near you.5 And you shall keep guard over the sanctuary and over the altar, that there may never again be wrath on the people of Israel.6 And behold, I have taken your brothers the Levites from among the people of Israel. They are a gift to you, given to the Lord, to do the service of the tent of meeting. ::Numbers 18:2-6 (ESV) =In the Prophets= The Book of Jeremiah speaks of a covenant with the Kohanim and Levites, connecting it with the covenant with the seed of King David: :As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured; so will I multiply the seed of David My servant, and the Levites that minister unto Me. :And the word of the came to Jeremiah, saying: :'Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying: The two families which the did choose, He hath cast them off? ::Jeremiah 33:22-24, Jewish Publication Society translation, 1917 The Book of Malachi also spoke of a covenant with Levi: :Know then that I have sent this commandment unto you, that My covenant might be with Levi, saith the of hosts. :My covenant was with him of life and peace, and I gave them to him, and of fear, and he feared Me, and was afraid of My name. :The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips; he walked with Me in peace and uprightness, and did turn many away from iniquity. ::Malachi 2:4-6, Jewish Publication Society translation, 1917 Malachi connected a purification of the \\"sons of Levi\\" with the coming of God's messenger: :Behold, I send My messenger, and he shall clear the way before Me; and the Lord, whom ye seek, will suddenly come to His temple, and the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in, behold, he cometh, saith the of hosts. :But who may abide the day of his coming? And who shall stand when he appeareth? For he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap; :And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver; and there shall be they that shall offer unto the offerings in righteousness. ::Malachi 3:1-3, Jewish Publication Society translation, 1917 Criticism Critical scholars who follow the documentary hypothesis propose that those parts of the Torah attributed to the Elohist seem to treat Levite as a descriptive attribute for someone particularly suited to the priesthood, rather than as a firm designation of a tribe, and feel that Moses and Aaron are being portrayed as part of the Joseph group rather than being part of a tribe called Levi. Jahwist passages have more ambiguous language; traditionally interpreted as referring to a person named Levi, they could also be interpreted as just referring to a social position titled levi.Jewish Encyclopedia In the Blessing of Jacob, Levi is treated as a tribe, cursing them to become scattered; critics regard this as an aetiological postdiction to explain how a tribe could be so scattered, the simpler solution being that the priesthood was originally open to any tribe, but gradually became seen as a distinct tribe to themselves.Peake's commentary on the Bible The Priestly source and the Blessing of Moses, which critical scholars view as originating centuries later, portray the Levites firmly established as a tribe, and as the only tribe with the right to become priests.

They have a rounded shape, a dense netting of rough lines on the skin, and become yellow at full maturity; they are sweet and aromatic, with a special aroma and flavor and a very high content of total soluble solids (values up to 18¬∞ are possible, although the minimum value to be considered commercially mature is 11¬∞). Ripeness is measured not by softness at the stem, but rather by color of the skin, when it starts turning from green to yellow. Left at room temperature, Galia keeps well, but after cutting, uneaten pieces should be wrapped and refrigerated to preserve flavor. They are not particularly difficult to grow.

It was founded in 1799 by the leading British scientists of the age, including Henry Cavendish and its first president, George Finch, the 9th Earl of Winchilsea. Its foundational principles were diffusing the knowledge of, and facilitating the general introduction of, useful mechanical inventions and improvements, as well as enhancing the application of science to the common purposes of life (including through teaching, courses of philosophical lectures, and experiments). A Friday Evening Discourse at the Royal Institution; Sir James Dewar on Liquid Hydrogen by Henry Jamyn Brooks, 1904Much of the Institution's initial funding and the initial proposal for its founding were given by the Society for Bettering the Conditions and Improving the Comforts of the Poor, under the guidance of philanthropist Sir Thomas Bernard and American-born British scientist Sir Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford. Since its founding it has been based at 21 Albemarle Street in Mayfair. Its Royal Charter was granted in 1800. History Michael Faraday's 1856 Christmas Lecture Throughout its history, the Institution has supported public engagement with science through a programme of lectures, many of which continue today. The most famous of these are the annual Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, founded by Michael Faraday in 1825. The Royal Institution was founded as the result of a proposal by the American-born Bavarian Count Rumford for the \\"formation by Subscription, in the Metropolis of the British Empire, of a Public Institution for diffusing the Knowledge and facilitating the general Introduction of useful Mechanical Inventions and Improvements, and for the teaching by courses of Philosophical Lectures and Experiments, the application of Science to the Common Purposes of Life\\". The first Professor and Public Lecturer in Experimental Philosophy, Mechanics and Chemistry was Dr Thomas Garnett, whom Rumford poached from the newly founded Andersonian Institute in Glasgow. Despite Garnett's first lectures being a great success, his salary was frozen, he was not allowed to practise as a doctor, and Humphry Davy was appointed as his assistant, so he resigned. Humphry Davy was an even greater success, as was his assistant and successor Michael Faraday. Davy's immediate successor was William Thomas Brande. Thus the Institution has had an instrumental role in the advancement of science since its founding. Notable scientists who have worked there include Sir Humphry Davy (who discovered sodium and potassium), Michael Faraday, James Dewar, Sir William Henry Bragg and Sir William Lawrence Bragg (who jointly won the Nobel prize for their work on x-ray diffraction), Max Perutz, John Kendrew, Antony Hewish, and George Porter. The Royal Institution Lecture Theatre. Here Michael Faraday first demonstrated electromagnetism In the 19th century, Faraday carried out much of the research which laid the groundwork for the practical exploitation of electricity at the Royal Institution. In total fifteen scientists attached to the Royal Institution have won Nobel Prizes. Ten chemical elements including sodium were discovered there; the electric generator was devised at the Institution, and much of the early work on the atomic structure of crystals was carried out within it. =Nobel laureates= # John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh (1842‚Äì1919) ‚Äì Physics 1904 with William Ramsay for the discovery of argon # Joseph John Thomson (1856‚Äì1940) ‚Äì Physics 1906 for studies of electrical connection through gases # Ernest, Baron Rutherford of Nelson (1871‚Äì1937) ‚Äì Chemistry 1908 for work on the chemistry of radioactive substances and the disintegration of the elements # William Lawrence Bragg (1890‚Äì1971)- Physics 1915 joint with WH Bragg, for determining the molecular structure of crystals using x-rays # William Henry Bragg (1862‚Äì1942)- Physics 1915 joint with WL Bragg, for determining the molecular structure of crystals using x-rays # Charles Scott Sherrington (1857‚Äì1952) ‚Äì Medicine 1932 shared with Edgar Adrian, 1st Baron Adrian, for his discovery of the function of neurons # Henry Hallett Dale (1875‚Äì1968) ‚Äì Medicine 1936 joint with Otto Loewi, for their work on the chemical transmission of nerve impulses # Peter Brian Medawar (1915‚Äì1987) ‚Äì Medicine 1960 for his work on making permanent skin grafts # John Cowdery Kendrew (1917‚Äì1997) ‚Äì Chemistry 1962 with Perutz, for determining the structures of haemoglobin and myoglobin using X-ray crystallography and (new at the time) electronic computers # Max Ferdinand Perutz (1914‚Äì2002) ‚Äì Chemistry 1962 with Kendrew, for determining the structures of haemoglobin and myoglobin using X-ray crystallography and (new at the time) electronic computers # Andrew Fielding Huxley (1917‚Äì2012) ‚Äì Medicine 1963 for explaining how nerves use electricity to send signals around the body # Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin (1910‚Äì1994) ‚Äì Chemistry 1964 for determining the structure of important biochemical substances including vitamin B12 and penicillin using X-ray techniques # George, Baron Porter of Luddenham (1920‚Äì2002) ‚Äì Chemistry 1967 for work on chemical reactions triggered by light, and for photographing the behaviour of molecules during fast reactions # Anthony Hewish (1924‚Äì) ‚Äì Physics 1974 for his work on the discovery of pulsars # Sir John Gurdon (born 1933) ‚Äì in 2012, he and Shinya Yamanaka were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for the discovery that mature cells can be converted to stem cells =Chemical elements= # Potassium ‚Äì isolated from caustic potash by Humphry Davy in 1807 using electrolysis. # Sodium ‚Äì Humphry Davy first isolated sodium in 1807 from molten sodium hydroxide. # Barium ‚Äì isolated by electrolysis of molten barium salts by Humphry Davy in 1808. # Boron ‚Äì discovered by Humphry Davy who first used electrolysis to produce a brown precipitate from a solution of borates in 1808.

The Institution's last director was Susan Greenfield. Sarah Harper, Professor of Gerontology at the University of Oxford, was announced as the new Director of the Ri in April 2017 and resigned in September 2017. =Andrade controversy= In 1952, Edward Andrade was forced to resign following a complicated controversy over the management of the Royal Institution and his powers as director, involving a power struggle with Alexander Rankine who was secretary. Following various resignations and general meetings of members, Andrade was awarded ¬£7,000 by arbitration: the arbitrators blamed the problems on \\"a lack of clear definition of roles ... an outdated constitution, and the inability of the protagonists to compromise\\". Andrade launched a lawsuit to set the arbitration aside, which he lost.Frank James & Vivianne Quirke \\"L'Affaire Andrade\\" in The Common Purposes of Life (Ashgate, 2002) =Greenfield controversy= From 1998 to 8 January 2010, the director of the Royal Institution was Baroness Susan Greenfield, but following a review, the position was abolished for being \\"no longer affordable\\". The Royal Institution had found itself in a financial crisis following a ¬£22 million development programme led by Greenfield, which included refurbishment of the institution's main Albemarle Street building, and the addition of a restaurant and bar with an aim to turn the venue into a \\"Groucho club for science\\". The project ended ¬£3 million in debt. Greenfield subsequently announced that she would be suing for discrimination. The RI's official statement stated it would \\"continue to deliver its main charitable objectives under the direction of chief executive officer, Chris Rofe and a talented senior team including Professor Quentin Pankhurst, the Director of the Davy- Faraday Research Laboratory, Dr Gail Cardew, the Head of Programmes and Professor Frank James, Head of Collections and Heritage.\\"Press Statement ‚Äî Baroness Greenfield and the role of Director at the Royal Institution , Royal Institution, UK, 8 January 2010. Baroness Greenfield later dropped the discrimination case. Current organisation The exterior of the Royal Institution today Today the Royal Institution is committed to \\"diffusing science for the common purposes of life\\". Membership is open to all, with no nomination procedure or academic requirements, on payment of an annual subscription. The Institution's patrons and trustees include: * Patron: The Prince of Wales * President: The Duke of Kent * Honorary Vice-President: Sir John Ritblat * Chairman: Sir Richard Sykes * Board of Trustees (current): Sophie Forgan, Simon Godwin, Julian Hunt, Roland Jackson, John Krumins, Christopher Potter, Alison Woollard.Board of Trustees, Royal Institution, UK. In February 2018, the institution appointed Dr Shaun Fitzgerald FREng as director. In July 2018, the institution announced a new five-year strategy running from October 2018 to September 2023. The strategy, which sets out to double the charity's size, involves \\"plans for new research, development of a new national science club and open forum public policy debates\\". One new venture will be a Research Centre for Science and Culture, working with other academic groups, this \\"will investigate historical and contemporary examples of the relationship between science and culture\\". The institution's palatial home has been greatly enlarged and redeveloped since 1799, and is a Grade I listed building. The structure's last refurbishment was a ¬£22 million project completed in 2008, intended to create a \\"science salon\\" for the public. As well as the famous Lecture Theatre, the building contains several function rooms, modern research facilities and a public caf√©. The trustees were considering selling the building in an effort to recoup the organisation's debts, which amounted to ¬£7 million. In 2013 The Ri received an anonymous donation of ¬£4.4m and as of January 2016, the Ri is now debt-free. The Institution (today abbreviated as the Ri) has a substantial public science programme and science for schools programme, holding over one hundred events per year on a wide variety of topics. The Christmas Lectures continue today as a series of three televised lectures aimed at children. The Friday Evening Discourses are monthly lectures given by eminent scientists, each limited to exactly one hour, a tradition started by Faraday. There is an annual members' ballot for tickets to the Christmas Lectures but all other events are open to the public. Discounts or free tickets are available to Ri Patrons and Members. Many other events and lectures are held both at Albemarle Street and at other venues around the country. Scientific research headed by Professor Quentin Pankhurst continues to be done under the auspices of the Davy-Faraday Research Laboratory (DFRL), and indeed this is considered to be one of the UK's most notable labs in nano-science. In May 2015, The Royal Institution was host to the historic unveiling of the Santara Computer, created by Dr Andrew Deonarine. In November 2015 a new membership scheme was launched and Fellows of the Ri were abolished. The new scheme includes the categories Member, Under 26 and Ri Young Member. A Patrons scheme has also been introduced for the first time. In December 2011 the Royal Institution launched the Ri Channel,Ri Channel www.richannel.org a new website displaying science videos and archive content from the Royal Institution, including past Christmas Lectures. The Ri Channel was archived in late 2017 with all Ri videos except past Christmas Lectures being hosted on YouTube. Past Christmas Lectures are hosted on the Ri's website and in early 2018 the Ri began a to upload all past Christmas Lectures that were not already available on its website. Despite its noble history, the Royal Institution has now become a mixed tenancy office building that hosts conferences, weddings and events in order to pay its bills. In 2015 it sold part of its historic collection of manuscripts to raise funds. In 2015, a room in the Institution was used in an experiment on moral ethics for the US TV scientific show Braingames. Faraday Museum Royal Institution. Faraday Museum. Faraday's original 1850s laboratory In 1973 the Royal Institution opened the Faraday Museum, a museum dedicated to Michael Faraday. It is in the main building in Albemarle Street and is open to the public during weekday office hours. The highlight of the exhibition is Faraday's original 1850s laboratory (not a reconstruction as often cited). Opposite this lab is the current state-of-the-art nanotechnology lab. Other exhibits include the discoveries, people and activities of the Royal Institution.

Background The Act is one of the Intolerable Acts (also known as Repressive Acts and Coercive Acts), which were designed to suppress dissent and restore order in Massachusetts. In the wake of the Boston Tea Party, the British Parliament launched a legislative offensive against Massachusetts to control its errant behavior. British officials believed that their inability to control Massachusetts was partly rooted in the highly-independent nature of its local government. On May 2, 1774, Lord North, speaking as the head of the ministry, called on Parliament to adopt the Act on the ground that the whole colony was \\"in a distempered state of disturbance and opposition to the laws of the mother country.\\"Ira D. Gruber, \\"The American Revolution as a Conspiracy: The British View.\\" William and Mary Quarterly (1969): 360-372. in JSTOR Contents The Massachusetts Government Act abrogated the colony's charter and provided for a greater amount of royal control. Massachusetts had been unique among the colonies in its ability to elect members of its executive council. The act took away that right and instead gave the king the sole power to appoint and dismiss the council. Additionally, many civil offices that had been chosen by election were now to be appointed by the royal governor.http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/mass_gov_act.asp Town meetings were forbidden without consent of the governor. As Lord North explained to Parliament, the purpose of the act was \\"to take the executive power from the hands of the democratic part of government.\\"Ian R. Christie and Benjamin W. Labaree, Empire or Independence, 1760‚Äì1776 (New York: Norton, 1976) p. 188. Governor Power was centralized in the hands of the royal governor, and historic rights to self-government were abrogated. The Act provided that local officials were no longer to be elected: : [The] governor, to nominate and appoint... and also to remove, without the consent of the council, all judges of the inferior courts of common pleas, commissioners of Oyer and Terminer, the attorney general, provosts, marshals, justices of the peace, and other officers... and nominate and appoint the sheriffs without the consent of the council. Most important was the provision regarding town meetings, the key instrument of local rule: :whereas a great abuse has been made of the power of calling such meetings, and the inhabitants have, contrary to the design of their institution, been misled to treat upon matters of the most general concern, and to pass many dangerous and unwarrantable resolves: for remedy whereof, be it enacted... no meeting shall be called... without the leave of the governor, [apart from one annual election meeting].text from Avalon project Implementation When Governor Thomas Gage invoked the act in October 1774 to dissolve the provincial assembly, its Patriot leaders responded by setting up an alternative government that actually controlled everything outside Boston. They argued that the new act had nullified the contract between the king and the people, who ignored Gage's order for new elections and set up the Massachusetts Provincial Congress. It acted as the province's (from 1776 the state's) government until the 1780 adoption of the Massachusetts State Constitution. The governor had control only in Boston, where his soldiers were based.Sosin, 1963 Parliament repealed the act in 1778 as part of attempts to reach a diplomatic end to the ongoing American Revolutionary War.

It is one of the measures (variously called the Intolerable Acts, the Punitive Acts or the Coercive Acts by many colonists) that were designed to secure Britain's jurisdiction over the American dominions. As such it is a part of the Grievances of the United States Declaration of Independence. These Coercive Acts included the Boston Port Act, the Massachusetts Government Act, and the Quebec Act. The Act allowed the royally appointed governor to remove any acquisition placed on a royal official by a patriot, if the governor did not believe the official would have a fair trial. The Act was referred to as the \\"Murder Act\\" because the patriots believed that the official could get away with capital offences. To assure trials more conducive to the Crown than the prejudices of local juries, the Act granted a change of venue to another British colony or Great Britain in trials of officials charged with a crime growing out of their enforcement of the law or suppression of riots. Witnesses for both sides were also required to attend the trial and were to be compensated for their expenses.

He served as the head football coach at the International YMCA Training School (now called Springfield College) (1890‚Äì1891), the University of Chicago (1892‚Äì1932), and the College of the Pacific (1933‚Äì1946), compiling a career college football record of . His undefeated Chicago Maroons teams of 1905 and 1913 have been recognized as national champions. He was also the head basketball coach for one season at Chicago (1920‚Äì1921), and the Maroons' head baseball coach for nineteen seasons (1893‚Äì1905, 1907‚Äì1913). At Chicago, Stagg also instituted an annual prep basketball tournament and track meet. Both drew the top high school teams and athletes from around the United States. Stagg played football as an end at Yale University and was selected to the first All-America Team in 1889. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as both a player and a coach in the charter class of 1951 and was the only individual honored in both roles until the 1990s. Influential in other sports, Stagg developed basketball as a five-player sport. This five-man concept allowed his 10 (later 11) man football team the ability to compete with each other and to stay in shape over the winter. Stagg was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in its first group of inductees in 1959. Stagg also forged a bond between sports and religious faith early in his career that remained important to him for the rest of his life. Early years Stagg was born in a poor Irish neighborhood of West Orange, New Jersey, and matriculated at Phillips Exeter Academy. =Yale= Stagg attended Yale College in New Haven, Connecticut, where he was a divinity student, and a member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity. It is lesser known that he was a member of \\"The Order of the Skull and Bones,\\" a controversial secret society with members including multiple former U.S. presidents. Baseball Stagg was as a pitcher at Yale; he declined an opportunity to play for six different professional baseball teams. He nonetheless influenced the game through his invention of the batting cage. 1888 team Football Stagg played on the 1888 team, and was an end on the first All-America Team in 1889. =Springfield= He later abandoned the theology career and received a MPE from Young Men's Christian Training School (now known as Springfield College) in 1891. Basketball Basketball had been invented in 1891 by James Naismith, a teacher at the YMCA School in Springfield. On March 11, 1892, Stagg, still an instructor at the YMCA School, played in the first public game of basketball. A crowd of 200 watched as the student team beat the faculty, 5‚Äì1. Stagg scored the only basket for the losing side. He popularized basketball teams having five players.Amos Alonzo Stagg Coaching career Stagg in 1899 Stagg became the first paid football coach at Williston Seminary, a secondary school, in 1890. This was also Stagg's first time receiving pay to coach football. He would coach there one day a week while also coaching full-time at Springfield College. Stagg then coached at the new University of Chicago from 1892 to 1932. Eventually, university president Robert Maynard Hutchins forced out the septuagenarian Stagg, whom he felt was too old to continue coaching. At age 70, Stagg moved on to the College of the Pacific in Stockton, California, where he led the Tigers for 14 seasons, from 1933 through 1946, then was asked to resign. In the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, Stagg served as a coach with the U.S. Olympic Track and Field team. He played himself in the movie Knute Rockne, All American, released in 1940. From 1947 to 1952 he served as co- coach with his son, Amos Jr., at Susquehanna University in Pennsylvania. Stagg's final job was as kicking coach at the local junior college in Stockton, California, which was then known as Stockton College. \\"The Grand Old Man of Football\\" retired from Stockton College at the age of 96 and died in Stockton six years later. Family Stagg was married to the former Stella Robertson on September 10, 1894. The couple had three children: two sons, Amos Jr. and Paul, and a daughter, Ruth. Both sons played for the elder Stagg as quarterbacks at the University of Chicago and each later coached college football. In 1952, Barbara Stagg, Amos' granddaughter, started coaching the high school girls' basketball team for Slatington High School in Slatington, Pennsylvania. Legacy Two high schools in the United States, one in Palos Hills, Illinois, and the other in Stockton, California, and an elementary school in Chicago, Illinois, are named after Stagg. The NCAA Division III National Football Championship game, played in Salem, Virginia, is named the Stagg Bowl after him. The athletic stadium at Springfield College is named Stagg Field. The football field at Susquehanna University is named Amos Alonzo Stagg Field in honor of both Stagg Sr. and Jr. Stagg was the namesake of the University of Chicago's old Stagg Field where, on December 2, 1942, a team of Manhattan Project scientists led by Enrico Fermi created the world's first controlled, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction under the west stands of the abandoned stadium. At University of the Pacific in Stockton, California, one of the campus streets is known as Stagg Way and Pacific Memorial Stadium, the school's football and soccer stadium, was renamed Amos Alonzo Stagg Memorial Stadium on October 15, 1988. Phillips Exeter Academy also has a field named for him and a statue. A field in West Orange, New Jersey on Saint Cloud Avenue is also named for him. The Amos Alonzo Stagg Award is awarded to the \\"individual, group or institution whose services have been outstanding in the advancement of the best interests of football.\\" The winner of the Big Ten Football Championship Game, started in 2011, receives the Stagg Championship Trophy, named in his honor. At the College of William and Mary, the Amos Alonzo Stagg Society was organized during 1979‚Äì1980 by students and faculty opposed to a plan by the institution‚Äôs Board of Visitors to move William and Mary back into big-time college football several decades after a scandal there involving grade changes for football players. The Society was loosely organized, but successful in combating, among other plans, a major expansion of the William and Mary football stadium. Collections of Amos Alonzo Stagg's papers are held at the University of Chicago Library, Special Collections Research Center and at the University of the Pacific Library, Holt Atherton Department of Special Collections. The Alonzo Stagg 50/20 Hike goes through Arlington, Virginia, Washington, DC and Maryland. The Stagg Tree, a giant sequoia in the Alder Creek Grove and the fifth largest tree in the world, is named in honor of Amos Alonzo Stagg. =Stagg Bowl= The Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl, otherwise known as the NCAA Division III Football Championship Game since 1973, is competed annually as the final game of the NCAA Division III Football Tournament. The Stagg Bowl can be traced back to 1969, prior to the inception of the D-III national championship. At that time‚Äîfrom 1969 to 1973‚Äîthe Stagg Bowl was one of two bowls competed at the College Division level‚Äîthe Knute Rockne Bowl and the Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl. In 1973, the NCAA instituted the D-III national championship, and the Stagg Bowl was adopted as the moniker for that game. The first 10 Stagg Bowls were played in Phenix City, Alabama, from 1973 to 1982. Wittenberg University (Ohio) won the inaugural game via a 41‚Äì0 result over Juniata College (Pa.). The game moved to Kings Island, Ohio, for the 1983 and 1984 editions, with Augustana College (Ill.) winning the first two of its four straight NCAA titles. The Stagg Bowl returned to Phenix City for five more years, before spending three seasons in Bradenton, Florida. In 1993, the Stagg Bowl moved to Salem, Va., where it has been competed each year since (20 games after the 2012 championship). The University of Mount Union (formerly Mount Union College) won the first of its NCAA Division III-record 13 football national championships in 1993.NCAA Division III Football Championship record book =Innovations= Stagg invented the end-around play (diagram pictured), and published the first book with plays diagrammed The following is a list of innovations Stagg introduced to American football.

He invented the first laryngoscope.http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/con-ciencia/ciencia-manuel- patricio-garci/2352708/ Biography Garc√≠a was born on 17 March 1805 either in Madrid, as has been traditionally stated, or in the town of Zafra in Badajoz Province, Spain.Nearly all sources (e.g. Fitzlyon; Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online; H. Rosenthal and J. Warrack, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera, London, Oxford University Press, 1964, ad nomen; Teresa Radomski, Manuel Garc√≠a (1805/1906): A Bicentenary Reflection, \\"Australian Voice\\", Volume 11, 2005, p. 26) report Madrid as Garcia‚Äôs (likely) birthplace, but his pupil and biographer Malcolm Sterling Mackinlay wrote that \\"the place of his birth was not Madrid, as has been so often stated, but Zafra in Catalonia\\" (Garcia the centenarian, p. 13). In fact, however, the town of Zafra is in Extremadura, not in Catalonia. His father was singer and teacher Manuel del P√≥pulo Vicente Rodriguez Garc√≠a (Manuel Garc√≠a I, 1775‚Äì1832). His sisters were Maria Malibran (1808‚Äì1836) and Pauline Viardot (1821‚Äì1910). After abandoning his onstage career as a baritone, Garc√≠a began to teach at the Paris Conservatory (1830‚Äì48) and the Royal Academy of Music, London (1848‚Äì95). Jessie Bond, Camille Everardi, Erminia Frezzolini, Julius G√ºnther, Jenny Lind, Mathilde Marchesi, Christina Nilsson, Julia Ettie Crane, Julius Stockhausen, Marie Tempest, Charles Santley and Henry Wood were among his pupils. He invented a laryngoscope in 1854 and the next year published observations of his own larynx and vocal cords made with a small dental mirror introduced into the throat and using sunlight reflected by another mirror.American Otological Society (1905). The Laryngoscope. Volume 15, pp. 402-403 He has been credited with saving the career of Jenny Lind, who had suffered vocal damage from overwork in her early twenties. Garc√≠a was interested in movements connected with the production of the singing voice and did not anticipate the importance of laryngoscopy for medicine. Still, the University of K√∂nigsberg conferred upon him the honorary degree of M.D.Mackinlay, p. 219 He died in London in 1906 at the age of 101 years and was buried in the churchyard of St. Edward's Catholic church in Sutton Green, Surrey. His grave gives details of his many famous pupils and accomplishments. On 22 November 1832 in Paris Garc√≠a married the operatic soprano C√©cile Eug√©nie Mayer (Paris, 8 April 1814 - Paris, 12 August 1880). They had two sons Manuel (1836 - 1885) Gustave (1837-1925) and two daughters, Eugenie Harouel (1840-1924) and Marie Cr√®pet (1842-1867). His second son Gustave Garcia (1 February 1837 ‚Äì 1925) was a singer, actor, and author of three books on vocal and stage techniques. Gustave's son, Albert Garc√≠a (1875‚Äì1946), studied voice with his great aunt (Pauline Viardot), became a respected baritone, and produced an edition of his grandfather's treatise on singing (1924). From second wife Beata Elena Rodriguez (+ 19 April 1917) were born 2 daughters, Paula (+ 1 May 1960) wife from 1901 of Major George McKenzie Franks (1868-1958) - and Manuela Beata Carmen (+ 5 March 1924).

It was historically an ancient centre of Buddhism, Islam, and Zoroastrianism and one of the major cities of Khorasan, since the latter's earliest history. The ancient city of Balkh was known to the Ancient Greeks as Bactra, giving its name to Bactria. It was mostly known as the centre and capital of Bactria or Tokharistan. Marco Polo described Balkh as a \\"noble and great city\\". Balkh is now for the most part a mass of ruins, situated some from the right bank of the seasonally flowing Balkh River, at an elevation of about . French Buddhist Alexandra David-N√©el associated Shambhala with Balkh, also offering the Persian Sham-i-Bala (\\"elevated candle\\") as an etymology of its name.David- N√©el, A. Les Nouvelles litt√©raires;1954, p.1 In a similar vein, the Gurdjieffian J. G. Bennett published speculation that Shambalha was Shams-i- Balkh, a Bactrian sun temple. Bennett notes Idries Shah as the source of the suggestion. Etymology The Bactrian language name of the city was . In Middle Persian texts was named Baxl (). The name of the province or country also appears in the Old Persian inscriptions (B.h.i 16; Dar Pers e.16; Nr. a.23) as BƒÅxtri, i.e. Bakhtri (). It is written in the Avesta as BƒÅxŒ¥i () . From this came the intermediate form BƒÅxli, Sanskrit Bahlƒ´ka (also Balhika) for \\"Bactrian\\", and by transposition the modern Persian Balx, i.e. Balkh, and Armenian Bahl. History Balkh is considered to be the first city to which the Indo-Iranian tribes moved from north of the Amu Darya, between 2000 and 1500 BC.Nancy Hatch Dupree, An Historical Guide to Afghanistan, 1977, Kabul, Afghanistan The Arabs called it Umm Al-Bilad or Mother of Cities on account of its antiquity. The city was traditionally a center of Zoroastrianism.The Greeks in Bactria and India. William Woodthorpe Tarn. 1st Edition, 1938; 2nd Updated Edition, 1951. 3rd Edition, updated with a Preface and a new bibliography by Frank Lee Holt. Ares Publishers, Inc., Chicago. 1984. (1984), pp. 114‚Äì115 and n. 1. The name Zariaspa, which is either an alternate name for Balkh or a term for part of the city, may derive from the important Zoroastrian fire temple Azar-i-Asp. Balkh was regarded as the place where Zoroaster first preached his religion, as well as the place where he died. Map showing Balkh (here indicated as Bactres), the capital of Bactria during the Hellenistic Age Since the Indo-Iranians built their first kingdom in Balkh (Bactria, Daxia, Bukhdi) some scholars believe that it was from this area that different waves of Indo-Iranians spread to north-east Iran and Seistan region, where they, in part, became today's Persians, Tajiks, Pashtuns and Baluch people of the region. The changing climate has led to desertification since antiquity, when the region was very fertile. Its foundation is mythically ascribed to Keyumars, the first king of the world in Persian legend; and it is at least certain that, at a very early date, it was the rival of Ecbatana, Nineveh and Babylon. For a long time the city and country was the central seat of the dualistic Zoroastrian religion, the founder of which, Zoroaster, died within the walls according to the Persian poet Firdowsi. Armenian sources state that the Arsacid Dynasty of the Parthian Empire established its capital in Balkh. There is a long-standing tradition that an ancient shrine of Anahita was to be found here, a temple so rich it invited plunder. Alexander the Great married Roxana of Bactria after killing the king of Balkh. The city was the capital of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and was besieged for three years by the Seleucid Empire (208‚Äì206 BC). After the demise of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom, it was ruled by Indo-Scythians, Parthians, Indo-Parthians, Kushan Empire, Indo-Sassanids, Kidarites, Hephthalite Empire and Sassanid Persians before the arrival of the Arabs. =Bactrian religion= Bactrian documents - in the Bactrian language, written from the fourth to eighth centuries - consistently evoke the name of local deities, such as Kamird and Wakhsh, for example, as witnesses to contracts. The documents come from an area between Balkh and Bamiyan, which is part of Bactria. =Buddhism= Balkh town is well known to Buddhist countries because of two great Buddhist monks of Afghanistan ‚Äì Trapusa and Bahalika. There are two stupas over their relics. According to a popular legend, Buddhism was introduced in Balkh by Bhallika, disciple of Buddha, and the city derives its name from him. He was a merchant of the region and had come from Bodhgaya. In literature, Balkh has been described as Balhika, Valhika or Bahlika. First Vihara at Balkh was built for Bhallika when he returned home after becoming a Buddhist monk. Xuanzang visited Balkh in 630 when it was a flourishing centre of Hinayana Buddhism. According to the Memoirs of Xuanzang, there were about a hundred Buddhist convents in the city or its vicinity at the time of his visit there in the 7th century. There were 3,000 monks and a large number of stupas and other religious monuments. The most remarkable stupa was the Navbahara (Sanskrit, Nav Vihara: New Monastery), which possessed a gigantic statue of Buddha. Shortly before the Arab conquest, the monastery became a Zoroastrian fire-temple. A curious reference to this building is found in the writings of the geographer Ibn Hawqal, an Arab traveller of the 10th century, who describes Balkh as built of clay, with ramparts and six gates, and extending for half a parasang. He also mentions a castle and a mosque. A Chinese pilgrim, Fa-Hein, (c.400) found Hinayana practice prevalent in Shan Shan, Kucha, Kashgar, Osh, Udayana and Gandhara. Xuanzang remarked that Buddhism was widely practised by the Hunnish rulers of Balkh, who descended from Indian royal stock.Buddhism in Central Asia by Baij Nath Puri, Motilal Banarsi Dass Publishers, Page 130 A Korean monk, Huichao, noted as late as the eighth century after the Arab invasion that the residents of Balkh practiced Buddhism and followed a Buddhist king. He noted the Arab invasion and that the king of Balkh at the time had fled to nearby Badakshan. Furthermore, we know that a number of Buddhist religious centres flourished in Khorasan. The most important was the Nawbahar (New Temple) near the town of Balkh, which evidently served as a pilgrimage centre for political leaders who came from far and wide to pay homage to it.Reinterpreting Islamic Historiography: HƒÅr≈´n al-Rashƒ´d and the narrative of the  ªAbbƒÅsid caliphate by Tayeb El-Hibri published by Cambridge University Press, 1999 Page 8 , A large number of Sanskrit medical, pharmacological toxicological texts were translated into Arabic under the patronage of Khalid, the vizier of Al-Mansur. Khalid was the son of a chief priest of a Buddhist monastery. Some of the family were killed when the Arabs captured Balkh; others including Khalid survived by converting to Islam. They were to be known as the Barmikis of Baghdad.India, the Ancient Past: a history of the Indian sub-continent from c. 7000 BC to AD 1200 by Burjor Avari Edition: illustrated Published by Taylor & Francis. , Page 220. =Judaism= An ancient Jewish community existed in Balkh as recorded by the Arab historian Al-Maqrizi who wrote that the community was established by the transfer of Jews to Balkh by the Assyrian King Sennacherib. A BƒÅb al-Yah≈´d (Gate of Jews) and al-Yah≈´diyya (Jewish town) in Balkh is attested to by Arab geographers. Muslim tradition stated that the prophet Jeremiah fled to Balkh and that Ezekiel was buried there. This Jewish community was noted in the eleventh century as the Jews of the city were forced to maintain a garden for the Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni for which they paid a tax of 500 dirhems. According to Jewish oral history, Timur gave the Jews of Balkh a city quarter of their own with a gate to close it. The Jewish community in Balkh was reported as late as the nineteenth century where Jews still resided in a special quarter of the city. The famed Jewish exegete Hiwi al-Balkhi was from Balkh. =Arab Conquest= A silver dirham of the Umayyad Caliphate, minted at Balkh al-Baida in AH 111 (= 729/30 CE). At the time of the Islamic conquest of Persia in the 7th century, however, Balkh had provided an outpost of resistance and a safe haven for the Persian emperor Yazdegerd III who fled there from the armies of Umar. Later, in the 9th century, during the reign of Ya'qub bin Laith as-Saffar, Islam became firmly rooted in the local population. Arabs occupied Persia in 642 (during the Caliphate of Uthman, 644‚Äì656 AD). Attracted by the grandeur and wealth of Balkh, they attacked it in 645 AD. It was only in 653 when Arab commander al-Ahnaf raided the town again and compelled it to pay tribute. The Arab hold over the town, however, remained tenuous. The area was brought under Arab control only after it was reconquered by Muawiya in 663 AD. Prof. Upasak describes the effect of this conquest in these words: \\"The Arabs plundered the town and killed the people indiscriminately. It is said that they raided the famous Buddhist shrine of Nava-Vihara, which the Arab historians call 'Nava Bahara' and describe it as one of the magnificent places, which comprised a range of 360 cells around the high stupas'. They plundered the gems and jewels that were studded on many images and stupas and took away the wealth accumulated in the Vihara but probably did no considerable harm to other monastic buildings or to the monks residing there\\". The Arab attacks had little effect on the normal ecclesiastical life in the monasteries or Balkh Buddhist population outside. Buddhism continued to flourish with their monasteries as the centres of Buddhist learning and training. Scholars, monks and pilgrims from China, India and Korea continued to visit this place. Several revolts were made against the Arab rule in Balkh. The Arabs' control over Balkh did not last long as it soon came under the rule of a local prince, a zealous Buddhist called Nazak (or Nizak) Tarkhan. He expelled the Arabs from his territories in 670 or 671. He is said to have not only reprimanded the Chief Priest (Barmak) of Nava-Vihara but beheaded him for embracing Islam. As per another account, when Balkh was conquered by the Arabs, the head priest of the Nava-Vihara had gone to the capital and became a Muslim. This displeased the people of the Balkh. He was deposed and his son was placed in his position. Nazak Tarkhan is also said to have murdered not only the Chief Priest but also his sons. Only a young son was saved. He was taken by his mother to Kashmir where he was given training in medicine, astronomy and other sciences. Later they returned to Balkh. Prof. Maqbool Ahmed observes \\"One is tempted to think that the family originated from Kashmir, for in time of distress, they took refuge in the Valley. Whatever it be, their Kashmiri origin is undoubted and this also explains the deep interest of the Barmaks, in later years, in Kashmir, for we know they were responsible for inviting several scholars and physicians from Kashmir to the Court of Abbasids.\\" Prof. Maqbool also refers to the descriptions of Kashmir contained in the report prepared by the envoy of Yahya bin Barmak. He surmises that the envoy could have possibly visited Kashmir during the reign of Samgramapida II (797‚Äì801). Reference has been made to sages and arts. The Arabs managed to bring Balkh under their control only in 715 AD, in spite of strong resistance offered by the Balkh people during the Umayyad period. Qutayba ibn Muslim al-Bahili, an Arab General was Governor of Khurasan and the east from 705 to 715. He established a firm hold over lands beyond the Oxus for the Arabs. He fought and killed Tarkhan Nizak in Tokharistan (Bactria) in 715. In the wake of Arab conquest, the resident monks of the Vihara were either killed or forced to abandon their faith. The Viharas were razed to the ground. Priceless treasures in the form of manuscripts in the libraries of monasteries were consigned to ashes. Presently, only the ancient wall of the town, which once encircled it, stands partially. Nava-Vihara stands in ruins, near Takhta-i-Rustam. In 726, the Umayyad governor Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri rebuilt Balkh and installed in it an Arab garrison, while in his second governorship, a decade later, he transferred the provincial capital there. The Umayyad period lasted until 747, when Abu Muslim captured it for the Abbasids (next Sunni Caliphate dynasty) during the Abbasid Revolution. The city remained in Abbasid hands until 821, when it was taken over by the Tahirid dynasty, albeit still in the Abbasids' name. In 870, the Saffarids captured it. =From Saffarids to Khwarezmshahs= In 870, Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al- Saffar rebelled against Abbasid rule and founded the Saffarid dynasty at Sistan. He captured present Afghanistan and most of present Iran. His successor Amr ibn al-Layth, tried to capture Transoxiana from the Samanids, who were nominally vassals of Abbasids, but he was defeated and captured by Ismail Samani at Battle of Balkh in 900. He was sent to the Abbasid Caliph as a prisoner and was executed in 902. The power of Saffarids was diminished and they became vassals of the Samanids. Thus Balkh now passed to them. Samanid rule in Balkh lasted until 997, when their former subordinates, the Ghaznavids, captured it. In 1006, Balkh was captured by Karakhanids, but Ghaznavids recaptured it 1008. Finally, the Seljuks (Turks) conquered Balkh in 1059. In 1115, it was occupied and looted by irregular Oghuz Turks. Between 1141 and 1142, Balkh was captured by Atsiz, Shah of Khwarezm, after the Seljuks were defeated by the Kara-Khitan Khanate at the Battle of Qatwan. Ahmad Sanjar decisively defeated a Ghurid army, commanded by Ala al-Din Husayn and he took him prisoner for two years before releasing him as a vassal of the Seljuks. The next year, he marched against rebellious Oghuz Turks from Khuttal and Tukharistan. But he was defeated twice and was captured after a second battle in Merv. The Oghuzs looted Khorasan after their victory. Balkh was nominally ruled by Mahmud Khan, the former khan of Western Karakhanids, but the real power was held by Muayyid al-Din Ay Aba, amir of Nishabur for three years. Sanjar finally escaped from captivity and returned to Merv through Termez. He died in 1157 and control of Balkh passed to Mahmud Khan until his death in 1162. It was captured by Khwarezmshahs in 1162, by the Kara Khitans in 1165, by the Ghurids in 1198 and again by Khwarezmshahs in 1206. Muhammad al-Idrisi, in the 12th century, speaks of its possessing a variety of educational establishments, and carrying on an active trade. There were several important commercial routes from the city, stretching as far east as India and China. The late 12th-century local chronicle The Merits of Balkh (Fada'il-i-Balkh), by Abu Bakr Abdullah al-Wa'iz al-Balkhi, states that a woman known only as the khatun (lady) of Davud, from 848 appointed governor of Balkh, had taken over from him with \\"particular responsibility for the city and people\\" while he was busy building himself an elaborate pleasure palace called Nawsh«éd (New Joy).Arezou Azad: \\"Islam's forgotten scholars\\", History Today, Vol. 66, No. 10 (October 2016), p. 27. =Mongol invasion= In 1220 Genghis Khan sacked Balkh, butchered its inhabitants and levelled all the buildings capable of defence ‚Äì treatment to which it was again subjected in the 14th century by Timur. Notwithstanding this, however, Marco Polo (probably referring to its past) could still describe it as \\"a noble city and a great seat of learning.\\" For when Ibn Battuta visited Balkh around 1333 during the rule of the Kartids, who were Tadjik vassals of the Persia-based Mongol Ilkhanate until 1335, he described it as a city still in ruins: \\"It is completely dilapidated and uninhabited, but anyone seeing it would think it to be inhabited because of the solidity of its construction (for it was a vast and important city), and its mosques and colleges preserve their outward appearance even now, with the inscriptions on their buildings incised with lapis-blue paints.\\" It was not reconstructed until 1338. It was captured by Tamerlane in 1389 and its citadel was destroyed, but Shah Rukh, his successor, rebuilt the citadel in 1407. =16th to 19th centuries= The Green Mosque of Balkh In 1506 Uzbeks entered Balkh under the command of Muhammad Shaybani. They were briefly expelled by the Safavids in 1510. Babur ruled Balkh between 1511 and 1512 as a vassal of the Persian Safavids. But he was defeated twice by the Khanate of Bukhara and was forced to retire to Kabul. Balkh was ruled by Bukhara except for Safavid rule between 1598 and 1601. The Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan fruitlessly fought them there for several years in the 1640s. Nevertheless, Balkh was ruled by the Mughal Empire from 1641 and turned into a subah (imperial top-level province) in 1646 by Shah Jahan, only to be lost in 1647, just like the neighboring Badakhshan Subah. Balkh was the government seat of Aurangzeb in his youth. In 1736 it was conquered by Nader Shah. After his assassination, local Uzbek Hadji Khan declared the independence of Balkh in 1747, but he submitted to Bukhara in 1748. Under the Durani monarchy it fell into the hands of the Afghans in 1752. Bukhara regained it in 1793. It was conquered by Shah Murad of Kunduz in 1826, and for some time was subject to the Emirate of Bukhara. In 1850, Dost Mohammad Khan, the Emir of Afghanistan, captured Balkh, and from that time it remained under Afghan rule. In 1866, after a malaria outbreak during the flood season, Balkh lost its administrative status to the neighbouring city of Mazar-i-Sharif (MazƒÅr-e ≈†arƒ´f). =20th to 21st centuries= A street in Balkh with several horse carts, c. 2005 In 1911 Balkh comprised a settlement of about 500 houses of Afghan settlers, a colony of Jews and a small bazaar set in the midst of a waste of ruins and acres of debris. Entering by the west (Akcha) gate, one passed under three arches, in which the compilers recognized the remnants of the former Jama Masjid (, Friday Mosque). The outer walls, mostly in utter disrepair, were estimated about in perimeter. In the south-east, they were set high on a mound or rampart, which indicated a Mongol origin to the compilers. The fort and citadel to the north-east were built well above the town on a barren mound and were walled and moated. There was, however, little left of them but the remains of a few pillars. The Green Mosque (), named for its green-tiled dome (see photograph top right corner) and said to be the tomb of the Khwaja Abu Nasr Parsa, had nothing but the arched entrance remaining of the former madrasah (, school). The town was garrisoned as of 1911 by a few thousand irregulars (kasidars), the regular troops of Afghan Turkestan being cantoned at Takhtapul, near Mazari Sharif. The gardens to the north-east contained a caravanserai that formed one side of a courtyard, which was shaded by a group of chenar trees Platanus orientalis. A project of modernization was undertaken in 1934, in which eight streets were laid out, housing and bazaars built. Modern Balkh is a centre of the cotton industry, of the skins known commonly in the West as \\"Persian lamb\\" (Karakul), and for agricultural produce like almonds and melons. The site and the museum have suffered from looting and uncontrolled digging during the 1990s civil war. After the Taliban's fall in 2001 some poor residents dug in an attempt to sell ancient treasures. The provisional Afghan government said in January 2002 that it had stopped the looting. Main sights =Ancient ruins of Balkh= Remains of a Hellenistic capital found in Balkh The earlier Buddhist constructions have proved more durable than the Islamic buildings. The Top-Rustam is in diameter at the base and at the top, circular and about high. Four circular vaults are sunk in the interior and four passages have been pierced below from the outside, which probably lead to them. The base of the building is constructed of sun-dried bricks about square and thick. The Takht-e Rustam is wedge-shaped in plan with uneven sides. It is apparently built of pis√© mud (i.e. mud mixed with straw and puddled). It is possible that in these ruins we may recognize the Nava Vihara described by the Chinese traveller Xuanzang. There are the remains of many other topes (or stupas) in the neighbourhood. The mounds of ruins on the road to Mazar-e Sharif probably represent the site of a city yet older than those on which stands the modern Balkh. =Others= Numerous places of interest are to be seen today aside from the ancient ruins and fortifications: *The madrasa of Sayed Subhan Quli Khan. *Bala-Hesar, the shrine and mosque of Khwaja Nasr Parsa. *The tomb of the poet Rabi'a Balkhi. *The Nine Domes Mosque (Masjid-e Noh Gonbad). This exquisitely ornamented mosque, also referred to as Haji Piyada, is the earliest Islamic monument yet identified in Afghanistan. *Tepe Rustam and Takht-e Rustam =Balkh Museum= The museum was formerly the second largest museum in the country, but its collection has suffered from looting in recent times. The museum is also known as the Museum of the Blue Mosque, from the building it shares with a religious library. As well as exhibits from the ancient ruins of Balkh, the collection includes works of Islamic art including a 13th-century Quran, and examples of Afghan decorative and folk art. Cultural role Balkh had a major role in the development of the Persian language and literature. The early works of Persian literature were written by poets and writers who were originally from Balkh. Many famous Persian poets came from Balkh, e.g.: *MawlƒÅnƒÅ Jalal ad-Din Balkhi, born in Balkh, in the 13th centuryhttps://mevlana-rumi- quotes.blogspot.com/2014/03/maulana-jalal-ud-din-muhammad-rumi.html *Amir Khusraw Dehlavi, whose father, Amir Saifuddin, was from here *Manuchihri Damghani, born in Balkh, according to Dawlat Shah Samarkandi *Rashidudin Watwat, poet *Sanih Balkhi, poet *Shaheed Balkhi, Abul Muwayed Balkhi, Abu Shukur Balkhi, Ma'roofi Balkhi, early poets of the 9th or 10th centuries *Rabi'a Balkhi, first woman poet in the history of Persian poetry, lived in the 10th century *Avicenna or Ibn Sina, 10th century philosopher and scientist whose father was a Balkh native *Unsuri Balkhi, 10th or 11th century poet *Anvari, 12th century, lived and died in Balkh *Daqiqi Balkhi, Abu Mansur Muhammad Ibn Ahmad Daqiqi Balkhi, born here =Other notable people= *Ibrahim ibn Adham, a Sufi saint and reputedly ruler of Balkh *Khalid ibn Barmak, wazir of the Abbasid Caliphate and member of the prominent Barmakid family *Abu Zayd al-Balkhi, Persian (850‚Äì934), polymath: geographer, mathematician, physician, psychologist and scientist *Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi, astrologer and astronomer at the Abbasid court, Islamic philosopher *Hiwi al- Balkhi, Bukharan Jewish exegete and Biblical critic *Abu-Shakur Balkhi (915‚Äì?), Persian poet *Ibn Balkhi, a conventional name for a 12th-century Iranian historian and author of the Persian book FƒÅrs-NƒÅma *Abdullah, father of Avicenna and respected Ismaili scholar See also *The Bahlikas *Balhae *Hiwi al-Balkhi *The Barmakids, who were from that city. *Kumargah *Mount Imeon *Vishtaspa *Roxana *Silk Road transmission of Buddhism *Balkh Province References Further reading ;Published in the 19th century * ;Published in the 21st century External links *The Balkh Art and Cultural Heritage Project housed at the Oriental Institute at the University of Oxford *Mazar-i-Sharif (Balkh) *Explore Balkh with Google Earth on Global Heritage Network *Indigenous Indian civilization prevailed in Balkh, Afghanistan till the second half of tenth century AD Category:Populated places established in the 2nd millennium BC Category:Populated places in Balkh Province Category:Populated places along the Silk Road Category:Former populated places in Afghanistan Category:Ancient Iranian cities Category:Districts of Balkh Province Category:Buddhism in Afghanistan Category:Places in Shahnameh ","title":"Balkh"},{"id":"332848","title":"List of mayors of Toronto"},{"id":"332853","text":"Cakewalk, Inc. is a former music production software company based in Boston, Massachusetts and currently a brand of BandLab Technologies. The company's best known product was their professional-level digital audio workstation (DAW) software, SONAR. SONAR integrated multi-track recording and editing of digital audio and MIDI. The company also offered a full range of music software products, including Pyro Audio Creator‚Äîa digital music management program, and Dimension Pro‚Äîa virtual instrument. The brand was acquired in 2013 by Gibson, and in 2017 Gibson announced it was ceasing Cakewalk development. In 2018, Singapore-based BandLab Technologies purchased some of Cakewalk, Inc.'s assets, and continued SONAR development as part of its portfolio of freeware digital audio workstation software.  History  Greg Hendershott founded the company in 1987 as Twelve Tone Systems, Inc., and was its CEO until July 1, 2012. The firm soon found that most customers referred to it by the name of its initial product, a MIDI music sequencer that Hendershott had named Cakewalk. To avoid confusion, the company operated for many years as \\"Twelve Tone Systems, Inc. DBA Cakewalk\\". The company released the original MIDI music sequencer product, Cakewalk, for MS-DOS in 1987. In 1991, they released a version for Windows 3.0. Early Cakewalk for DOS versions (up to 3.0) required the intelligent mode of the MPU-401, and so could not be used with product clones of the MPU-401, while later Cakewalk versions (since 4.0) relied on the \\"dumb\\" UART mode only. With the addition of more features, the company renamed the sequencer Cakewalk Pro, and then Cakewalk Pro Audio when it gained support for digitized audio. The SONAR digital audio workstation provided users the ability to create projects in which they could edit digital audio tracks, MIDI tracks, and associated information like lyrics and music notation. SONAR's visual displays included audio waveforms, musical scores, editing consoles, and event lists. The user could mix MIDI output and audio tracks down to a stereo .WAV file and burn it to a CD or publish it in other media formats.

The book, published by Prometheus Books (), is a collection of Isaac Asimov's diaries, personal letters, and a condensation of his three earlier autobiographies: * In Memory Yet Green, (1979, Doubleday) * In Joy Still Felt, (1980, Doubleday) * I. Asimov: A Memoir, (1994, Doubleday) Janet Jeppson Asimov's primary role was in choosing the entries and occasionally editing them so the reader would know the people of whom he was speaking. In one case, her edited version is less explicit than Isaac's original, where Isaac and \\"a famous man\\" debate anti-Semitism (chapter 23 of the book). The famous man voices opposition to scientists since some had aided the Holocaust, and Isaac replies that this is exactly the same as condemning the Jews for crucifying Jesus. The edited version omits the celebrity's name--Elie Wiesel.Asimov, I.

His most notable work is the autobiographical trilogy Cider with Rosie (1959), As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning (1969), and A Moment of War (1991). The first volume recounts his childhood in the Slad Valley. The second deals with his leaving home for London and his first visit to Spain in 1935, and the third with his return to Spain in December 1937 to join the Republican International Brigades. Early life and works Laurie Lee's childhood home, Bank Cottages (now Rosebank Cottage), in the village of Slad. Having been born in Stroud, Gloucestershire on 26 June 1914, Laurie Lee moved with his family to the village of Slad in 1917, the move with which Cider with Rosie opens. After fighting in the First World War with the Royal West Kent Regiment, Lee's father, Reginald Joseph Lee, did not return to the family. Lee and his brothers grew up loving the Lights, the family of their mother (Annie Emily Light), and intensely disliking their Lee relations. His sister, Frances Nemariah Joan Lee, died in 1915 aged three when Lawrence Lee was a toddler. He had older siblings from his father's first marriage: Dorothy, Harold, Reggie, Phyllis, and Marjorie, and two brothers from his parent‚Äôs marriage, Jack and Tony. His brother Jack Lee (born 1913) was to become a film director. At 12, Lee went to the Central Boys' School in Stroud. In his notebook for 1928, when he was 14, he listed \\"Concert and Dance Appointments\\", for at this time he was in demand to play his violin at dances. Lee left the Central School at 15 to become an errand boy at a Chartered Accountants in Stroud. In 1931, he first found the Whiteway Colony, two miles from Slad, a colony founded by Tolstoyan anarchists. This gave him his first smattering of politicisation and was where he met the composer Benjamin Frankel and the \\"Cleo\\" who appears in As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning. In 1933 he met Sophia Rogers, an \\"exotically pretty girl with dark curly hair\\" who had moved to Slad from Buenos Aires, an influence on Lee who said later in life that he only went to Spain because \\"a girl in Slad from Buenos Aires taught me a few words of Spanish.\\" At 20, Lee worked as an office clerk and a builder's labourer, and lived in London for a year before leaving for Vigo, in northwest Spain, in the summer of 1935. From there he travelled across Spain as far as Almu√±ecar on the coast of Andalusia. Walking more often than not, he eked out a living by playing his violin. His first encounter with Spain is the subject of As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning (1969). During this period he met a woman, Wilma Gregory, who supported him financially, and also met Mary Garman and Roy Campbell. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 Lee was picked up by HMS Blanche, a British destroyer from Gibraltar that was collecting marooned British subjects on the southern Spanish coast. Lee started to study for an art degree but returned to Spain in 1937 as an International Brigade volunteer. His service in the Brigade was cut short by his epilepsy. These experiences were recounted in A Moment of War (1991), an austere memoir of his time as a volunteer in the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39). According to many biographical sources, Lee fought in the Republican army against Franco's Nationalists. After his death there were claims that Lee's involvement in the war was a fantasy; the claims were dismissed as \\"ludicrous\\" by his widow. Lee met Lorna Wishart (sister of Mary) in Cornwall in 1937, and they had an affair (Lorna was married) lasting until she left him for Lucian Freud in 1943. They had a daughter, Yasmin David, together. Wishart's husband Ernest agreed to raise the girl as his own; she later became an artist. Before 1951 Lee worked primarily as a journalist and as a scriptwriter. During the Second World War he made documentary films for the GPO Film Unit (1939‚Äì40) and the Crown Film Unit (1941‚Äì43). From 1944 to 1946 he worked as the Publications Editor for the Ministry of Information.Lyman, Rick. \\"Poet Laurie Lee Dies at 82. \\" The New Straits Times, 20 May 1997. In 1950 Lee married Catherine Francesca Polge, whose father was Proven√ßal and whose mother was another of the Garman sisters, Helen; they had one daughter, Jessie. From 1950 to 1951 he was caption-writer- in-chief for the Festival of Britain, for which service he was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1952. The success of the autobiographical novel Cider with Rosie in 1959 allowed Lee to become a full- time independent writer. It continues to be one of the UK's most popular books, and is often used as a set English literature text for schoolchildren. The work depicts the hardships, pleasures and simplicity of rural life in the time of Lee's youth; readers continue to find the author's portrayal of his early life vivid and evocative. Lee said that the creation of the book took him two years, and that it was written three times. With the proceeds Lee was able to buy a cottage in Slad, the village of his childhood. Poetry Lee's first love was always poetry, though he was only moderately successful as a poet. Lee's poems had appeared in the Gloucester Citizen and the Birmingham Post, and in October 1934 his poem 'Life' won a prize from, and publication in, the Sunday Referee, a national paper.Lee, Laurie (1969) As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning, London: Andre Deutsch, p. 40. Another poem was published in Cyril Connolly's Horizon magazine in 1940 and his first volume of poems, The Sun My Monument, was launched in 1944. This was followed by The Bloom of Candles (1947) and My Many-coated Man (1955). Several poems written in the early 1940s reflect the atmosphere of the war, but also capture the beauty of the English countryside. The poem \\"Twelfth Night\\" from My Many- coated Man was set for unaccompanied mixed choir by American composer Samuel Barber in 1968. Other works Other works include A Rose for Winter, about a trip he made to Andalusia 15 years after the civil war; Two Women (1983), a story of Lee's courtship of and marriage to Kathy, daughter of Helen Garman; The Firstborn (1964), about the birth and childhood of their daughter Jessy (christened Jesse); and I Can't Stay Long (1975), a collection of occasional writing. Lee also wrote travel books, essays, radio plays and short stories. Honours and awards Lee received several awards, including the Atlantic Award (a Candian literary award (1944), the Society of Authors travelling award (1951), the William Foyle Poetry Prize (1956) and the W. H. Smith and Son Award (1960). In As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning, Lee writes of his stay in Almu√±√©car, a Spanish fishing village which he calls \\"Castillo\\". In 1988 the citizens of Almu√±√©car erected a statue in Lee's honour. In 1993, A Moment of War was chosen as a Notable Book of the Year by the editors of the New York Times Book Review. Lee provided a great deal of valuable support to the Brotherhood of Ruralists in their attempts to establish themselves in the 1970s, and he continued to do so until his death; his essay Understanding the Ruralists opened the Brotherhood's major 1993 retrospective book. Indeed, it was Lee who is said to have given them the name \\"Ruralists.\\" In 2003 the British Library acquired Lee's original manuscripts, letters and diaries. The collection includes two unknown plays and drafts of Cider with Rosie, which reveal that early titles for the book were Cider with Poppy, Cider with Daisy and The Abandoned Shade.Malvern, Jack. \\"Cider with Rosie Saved for Nation.\\" TimesOnline , 16 May 2003. Final years Laurie Lee's grave within the village churchyard. The inscription reads \\"He lies in the valley he loved\\" In the 1960s, Laurie Lee and his wife returned to Slad to live near his childhood home, where they remained for the rest of his life, though for many years he retained a pad in Chelsea, coming to London to work during the week and returning to Slad at weekends. Lee revealed on the BBC1 Wogan show in 1985 that he was frequently asked by children visiting Slad as part of their O-Level study of Cider with Rosie \\"where Laurie Lee was buried\\", assuming that the author was dead. An archive recording of Lee's voice was used for the narration of the Carlton Television film Cider with Rosie (1998), which was first broadcast after his death. The screenplay was written by his friend John Mortimer.Valerie Grove, Laurie Lee: the well-loved stranger (Viking, 1999), p. 520 Laurie Lee died in Slad on 13 May 1997, at the age of 82.

It is related to the \\"Mischief Night\\" practiced in parts of the United States such as Philadelphia, but is chiefly associated with the serious vandalism and arson seen in Detroit, Michigan, from the 1970s to the 1990s,Jack Santino, The Hallowed Eve, University Press of Kentucky (1998), Pg. 10. finally prompting the \\"Angels' Night\\" community response. Description Devil's Night dates from as early as the 1940s. Traditionally, city youths engaged in a night of mischievous or petty criminal behavior, usually consisting of minor pranks or acts of mild vandalism (such as egging, soaping or waxing windows and doors, leaving rotten vegetables or flaming bags of canine feces on stoops, or toilet papering trees and shrubs) which caused little or no property damage. However, in the early 1970s, the vandalism escalated to more destructive acts such as arson. This primarily took place in the inner city, but surrounding suburbs were often affected as well. The crimes became more destructive in Detroit's inner-city neighborhoods, and included hundreds of acts of arson and vandalism every year. The destruction reached a peak in the mid- to late-1980s, with more than 800 fires set in 1984, and a number in the hundreds for each subsequent year until 2011. Decline of Devil's Night arson Devil's Night arson in Detroit had not declined by the early 1990s. After a brutal Devil's Night in 1994, then-mayor Dennis Archer promised city residents arson would not be tolerated. In 1995, Detroit city officials organized and created Angels' Night on and around October 29‚Äì31. Each year as many as 50,000 volunteers gather to patrol neighborhoods in the city. Many volunteers kept a high profile, patrolling neighborhoods with magnetic-mount flashing amber beacons on their personal vehicles, along with communicating with command centers via CB radios or by cellular phones to report any suspicious activity. Incidences of arson and other crimes declined, a success largely attributed to the Angels' Night volunteers. The drop in reported fires for the year 2008 was credited to the Angels' Night program. That same year, 35,000 signed up to volunteer in the city, according to Daniel Cherrin, spokesperson for Detroit Mayor Ken Cockrel, Jr. As a result of the efforts, fires plunged to near-ordinary levels in the first decade of the 21st century. In 2010, the number of reported fires climbed to 169, a 42 percent increase compared to the previous year. However, subsequent years saw the totals again decline to the low 90s for the three-day period. This average of about 32 fires per day is somewhat higher than the expected 26 fires per day through the year.38 fires a 'quiet' Angels' Night in Detroit, says Mayor Duggan's office, mlive, October 31, 2014 2015 saw the lowest recorded number of fires with only 52 fires recorded and only 24 considered possibly arson.City of Detroit records quietest Angels' Night on record with 52 fires , WXYZ Detroit, November 1, 2015 In 2018, formal support of Angels' Night was ended with city resources being instead allocated to host neighborhood Halloween parties. Devil's Night 2018 recorded a total of 5 structure fires, with only 4 on the night before.Detroit: Halloween eve sees 5 fires, Detroit News, October 31, 2018 In the 2010s, the decline of Devil's Night fires has coincided with a rise in similar arson on the nights surrounding the July 4 Independence Day holiday.

Considered a founder of the field of virtual reality, Lanier and Thomas G. Zimmerman left Atari in 1985 to found VPL Research, Inc., the first company to sell VR goggles and gloves. In the late 1990s, Lanier worked on applications for Internet2, and in the 2000s, he was a visiting scholar at Silicon Graphics and various universities. In 2006 he began to work at Microsoft, and from 2009 has worked at Microsoft Research as an Interdisciplinary Scientist. Lanier has composed contemporary classical music and is a collector of rare instruments (of which he owns one to two thousand Dawn of the New Everything, pg. 144 (2017)); his acoustic album, Instruments of Change (1994) features Asian wind and string instruments such as the khene mouth organ, the suling flute, and the sitar-like esraj. Lanier teamed with Mario Grigorov to compose the soundtrack to the documentary film The Third Wave (2007). In 2010, Lanier was nominated in the TIME 100 list of most influential people. Early life and education (1960‚Äì1982) Born Jaron Zepel Lanier in New York City, Lanier was raised in Mesilla, New Mexico. Lanier's mother and father were Jewish; his mother was a concentration camp survivor from Vienna and his father's family had emigrated from Ukraine to escape the pogroms. When he was nine years old, his mother was killed in a car accident. He lived in tents for an extended period with his father before embarking on a seven-year project to build a geodesic dome home that he helped design. At the age of 13, Lanier convinced New Mexico State University to let him enroll. At NMSU, he took graduate-level courses; he received a grant from the National Science Foundation to study mathematical notation, which led him to learn computer programming. See also: Hamilton, Joan O'C. (1993-02-22). Business Week as quoted in \\"Jaron Lanier.\\" Encyclopedia of World Biography. 2004. From 1979 to 1980, the NSF-funded project at NMSU focused on \\"digital graphical simulations for learning\\". Lanier also attended art school in New York during this time, but returned to New Mexico and worked as an assistant to a midwife. The father of a baby he helped deliver gave him a car as a gift; Lanier drove the car to Santa Cruz. Atari Labs, VPL Research (1983‚Äì1990) In California, Lanier worked for Atari, where he met Thomas Zimmerman, inventor of the data glove. After Atari Inc. was split into two companies in 1984, Lanier became unemployed. The free time enabled him to concentrate on his own projects, including VPL, a \\"post-symbolic\\" visual programming language. Along with Zimmerman, Lanier founded VPL Research, focusing on commercializing virtual reality technologies; the company prospered for a while, but filed for bankruptcy in 1990. In 1999, Sun Microsystems bought VPL's virtual reality and graphics-related patents. Internet2, visiting scholar (1997‚Äì2001) From 1997 to 2001, Lanier was the Chief Scientist of Advanced Network and Services, which contained the Engineering Office of Internet2, and served as the Lead Scientist of the 'National Tele-immersion Initiative', a coalition of research universities studying advanced applications for Internet2. The Initiative demonstrated the first prototypes of tele-immersion in 2000 after a three-year development period. From 2001 to 2004, he was Visiting Scientist at Silicon Graphics Inc., where he developed solutions to core problems in telepresence and tele-immersion. He was also visiting scholar with the Department of Computer Science at Columbia University (1997‚Äì2001), a visiting artist with New York University's Interactive Telecommunications Program, and a founding member of the International Institute for Evolution and the Brain. Family Jaron Lanier and his wife, Lena, have one child, a daughter. Selected list of works in prose = \\"One-Half of a Manifesto\\" (2000) = In \\"One-Half a Manifesto\\", Lanier criticizes the claims made by writers such as Ray Kurzweil, and opposes the prospect of so-called \\"cybernetic totalism\\", which is \\"a cataclysm brought on when computers become ultra-intelligent masters of matter and life.\\" Lanier's position is that humans may not be considered to be biological computers, i.e., they may not be compared to digital computers in any proper sense, and it is very unlikely that humans could be generally replaced by computers easily in a few decades, even economically. While transistor count increases according to Moore's law, overall performance rises only very slowly. According to Lanier, this is because human productivity in developing software increases only slightly, and software becomes more bloated and remains as error-prone as it ever was. \\"Simply put, software just won't allow it. Code can't keep up with processing power now, and it never will.\\" At the end he warns that the biggest problem of any theory (esp. ideology) is not that it is false, \\"but when it claims to be the sole and utterly complete path to understanding life and reality.\\" The impression of objective necessity paralyzes the ability of humans to walk out of or to fight the paradigm and causes the self-fulfilling destiny which spoils people. =Post-symbolic communication (2006)= Some of Lanier's speculation involves what he calls \\"post-symbolic communication.\\" In his April 2006 Discover magazine column, he writes about cephalopods (i.e., the various species of octopus, squid, and related molluscs), many of which are able to morph their bodies, including changing the pigmentation and texture of their skin, as well as forming complex shape imitations with their limbs. Lanier sees this behavior, especially as exchanged between two octopodes, as a direct behavioral expression of thought. = Wikipedia and the omniscience of collective wisdom (2006)= In his online essay \\"Digital Maoism: The Hazards of the New Online Collectivism\\", in Edge magazine in May 2006, Lanier criticized the sometimes- claimed omniscience of collective wisdom (including examples such as the Wikipedia article about him, which he said recurrently exaggerates his film directing work), describing it as \\"digital Maoism\\". He writes \\"If we start to believe that the Internet itself is an entity that has something to say, we're devaluing those people [creating the content] and making ourselves into idiots.\\" His criticism aims at several targets that concern him and are at different levels of abstraction: * any attempt to create one final authoritative bottleneck that channels the knowledge onto society is wrong, regardless whether it is a Wikipedia or any algorithmically created system producing meta information, * it creates a false sense of authority behind the information, * a sterile style of wiki writing is undesirable because: ** it removes the touch with the real author of original information, it filters the subtlety of the opinions of the author, essential information (for example, the graphical context of original sources) is lost, * collective authorship tends to produce or align to mainstream or organizational beliefs, * he worries that collectively created works may be manipulated behind the scenes by anonymous groups of editors who bear no visible responsibility, ** and that this kind of activity might create future totalitarian systems as these are basically grounded on misbehaved collectives that oppress individuals. This critique is further explored in an interview with him on Radio National's The Philosopher's Zone, where he is critical of the denatured effect that \\"removes the scent of people\\". In December 2006 Lanier followed up his critique of the collective wisdom with an article in Edge entitled \\"Beware the Online Collective\\". Lanier writes: > I wonder if some aspect of human nature evolved in the context of competing > packs. We might be genetically wired to be vulnerable to the lure of the > mob... What's to stop an online mass of anonymous but connected people from > suddenly turning into a mean mob, just like masses of people have time and > time again in the history of every human culture? It's amazing that details > in the design of online software can bring out such varied potentials in > human behavior. It's time to think about that power on a moral basis. Lanier argues that the search for deeper information in any area sooner or later requires finding information that has been produced by a single person, or a few devoted individuals: \\"You have to have a chance to sense personality in order for language to have its full meaning.\\" That is, he sees limitations in the utility of an encyclopedia produced by only partially interested third parties as a form of communication. = You Are Not a Gadget (2010) = In his book You Are Not a Gadget (2010), Lanier criticizes what he perceives as the hive mind of Web 2.0 (wisdom of the crowd) and describes the open source and open content expropriation of intellectual production as a form of \\"Digital Maoism\\". Lanier accuses Web 2.0 developments of devaluing progress and innovation, as well as glorifying the collective at the expense of the individual. He criticizes Wikipedia and Linux as examples of this problem; Wikipedia for what he sees as: its \\"mob rule\\" by anonymous editors, the weakness of its non-scientific content, and its bullying of experts. Lanier also argues that there are limitations to certain aspects of the open source and content movement in that they lack the ability to create anything truly new and innovative. For example, Lanier argues that the open source movement didn't create the iPhone. In another example, Lanier further accuses Web 2.0 of making search engines lazy, destroying the potential of innovative websites such as Thinkquest, and hampering the communication of ideas such as mathematics to a wider audience. Lanier further argues that the open source approach has destroyed opportunities for the middle class to finance content creation, and results in the concentration of wealth in a few individuals‚Äî\\"the lords of the clouds\\"‚Äîpeople who, more by virtue of luck rather than true innovation, manage to insert themselves as content concentrators at strategic times and locations in the cloud. In the book, Lanier also criticizes the MIDI Standard for musical instrument commonality. His comments brought rebukes from industry and artists knowledgeable of the standard and suggestions that Lanier published his comments merely as bait for debate. = Who Owns the Future? (2013) = In his book Who Owns the Future? (2013), Lanier posits that the middle class is increasingly disenfranchised from online economies. By convincing users to give away valuable information about themselves in exchange for free services, firms can accrue large amounts of data at virtually no cost. Lanier calls these firms \\"Siren Servers,\\" alluding to the Sirens of Ulysses. Instead of paying each individual for their contribution to the data pool, the Siren Servers concentrate wealth in the hands of the few who control the data centers. For example, he points to Google's translation algorithm, which amalgamates previous translations uploaded by people online, giving the user its best guess. The people behind the source translations receive no payment for their work, while Google profits from increased ad visibility as a powerful Siren Server. In another example, Lanier points out that in 1988, Kodak employed 140,000 people when it led the digital imaging industry. By 2012, Kodak had filed for bankruptcy due to free photo-sharing sites such as Instagram that employed only 13 people at the time. As a solution to these problems, Lanier puts forth an alternative structure to the web based on Ted Nelson's Project Xanadu. He proposes a two-way linking system that would point to the source of any piece of information, creating an economy of micropayments that compensates people for original material they post to the web. = Dawn of the New Everything (2017) = In his book Dawn of the New Everything: Encounters with Reality and Virtual Reality (2017), Lanier reflects on his upbringing in 1960s New Mexico, his lifelong relationship with technology, and his path to Silicon Valley. Part personal memoir and part rumination on virtual reality, Lanier highlights VR's versatility both in historical context and projects its functions into the future. Lanier writes of VR's capacity to engage and inspire more than any other kind of technology (\\"TV and video games draw people into a zombielike trance ... while VR is active and makes you tired after a while\\"). He writes that the older, poorer VR equipment might have done an even better job at exposing one's own process of perception, since \\"the best enjoyment of VR includes not really being convinced. Like when you go to a magic show.\\" And he underscores how VR inherently helps the user focus on reality, rather than the virtual world, explaining that the best magic of VR happens in the moments right after the demo ends (his lab would often present flowers to visitors coming out of the headset, as the visitor would experience them as though for the first time). Lanier cites modern VR's rich resume beyond gaming and entertainment: it has been used to treat war veterans overcoming PTSD; by doctors to perform intricate surgeries; by paraplegics wanting to feel the sense of flight; and as a mechanism to prototype almost every vehicle fabricated in the last two decades. Throughout the book Lanier intersperses fifty-one definitions of VR, illuminating its many uses, gifts, and pitfalls. = Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now (2018) = As the name implies, Lanier is concerned about the influence of social media, and many of his criticisms of social media will feel familiar to observers of American politics and culture. In essence the claim is that platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have made their users cruder, less empathetic, more tribal. Lanier worries that reliance on social media platforms is reducing people's capacity for spirituality, and that social media users are in essence turning into automated extensions of the platforms. Assessment of the Internet Lanier asserts that the Internet mirrors the contemporary culture accurately,Lanier, Jaron, \\"Taking stock: So, what's changed in the last five years?\\", Wired, January 1998, p. 60 > \\"The Internet has created the most precise mirror of people as a whole that > we've yet had.

He is a pianist and a specialist in many non-western musical instruments, especially the wind and string instruments of Asia. He maintains one of the largest and most varied collections of actively-played rare instruments in the world. Lanier has performed with artists as diverse as Philip Glass, Ornette Coleman, George Clinton, Vernon Reid, Terry Riley, Duncan Sheik, Pauline Oliveros, and Stanley Jordan. Recording projects include his acoustic techno duet with Sean Lennon and an album of duets with flutist Robert Dick. Lanier also writes chamber and orchestral music. Current commissions include an opera that will premiere in Busan, South Korea, and a symphony, Symphony for Amelia, premiered by the Bach Festival Society Orchestra and Choir in Winter Park, Florida, in October 2010. Recent commissions include \\"Earthquake!\\" a ballet that premiered at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco in April 2006; \\"Little Shimmers\\" for the TroMetrik ensemble, which premiered at ODC in San Francisco in April 2006; \\"Daredevil\\" for the ArrayMusic chamber ensemble, which premiered in Toronto in 2006; A concert-length sequence of works for orchestra and virtual worlds (including \\"Canons for Wroclaw\\", \\"Khaenoncerto\\", \\"The Egg\\", and others) celebrating the 1000th birthday of the city of Wroclaw, Poland, premiered in 2000; A triple concerto, \\"The Navigator Tree\\", commissioned by the National Endowment for the Arts and the American Composers Forum, premiered in 2000; and \\"Mirror/Storm\\", a symphony commissioned by the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, which premiered in 1998.

The album has been described by Stephen Hill, on \\"The Crane Flies West 2\\" (episode 357) of Hearts of Space, as a Western exploration of Asian musical traditions. Lanier is currently working on a book, Technology and the Future of the Human Soul, and a music album, Proof of Consciousness, in collaboration with Mark Deutsch. Lanier's work with Asian instruments can be heard extensively on the soundtrack of Three Seasons (1999), which was the first film ever to win both the Audience and Grand Jury awards at the Sundance Film Festival. He and Mario Grigorov scored a film entitled The Third Wave, which premiered at Sundance in 2007. He is working with Terry Riley on a collaborative opera to be entitled Bastard, the First. Lanier has also pioneered the use of Virtual Reality in musical stage performance with his band Chromatophoria, which has toured around the world as a headline act in venues such as the Montreux Jazz Festival. He plays virtual instruments and uses real instruments to guide events in virtual worlds. In October 2010, Lanier collaborated with Rollins College and John V. Sinclair's Bach Festival Choir and Orchestra for his Worldwide Premiere of \\"Symphony for Amelia\\". Lanier contributed the afterword to Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture (MIT Press, 2008) edited by Paul D. Miller, a.k.a. DJ Spooky. On 9 May 1999 Lanier authored a New York Times opinion piece entitled \\"Piracy is Your Friend\\" in which he argued that the record labels were a much bigger threat to artists than piracy.

The design was based on that of the earlier G41(W), but incorporated an improved short-stroke piston gas system similar to that of the Soviet Tokarev SVT-40 It was manufactured using innovative mass-production techniques. History Germany's quest for a semi-automatic infantry rifle resulted in two designs ‚Äì the G41(M) and G41(W), from Mauser and Walther Arms respectively. The Mauser design was introduced in 1941 and at least 12,755 were made, but it proved unreliable in combat. The Walther design fared better in combat but still suffered from reliability problems. The problems with both designs stemmed from a demand made by the Army that the rifles not use holes drilled into the barrel, known as ports, to run the automatic loading mechanism. Meeting this requirement meant the designs had to use uncommon mechanisms that were simply unreliable and highly prone to fouling. The German invasion of the Soviet Union led to small numbers of the SVT-40 being captured and returned to Germany for examination. These used a simple gas mechanism powered from a port cut into the barrel about 1/3 of the way back from the end, and replaced the conventional stripper reloads with a modern box magazine. It was clearly superior to the G41's, and simpler as well. In 1943, Walther combined a similar gas system with aspects of the G41(W) providing greatly improved performance. It was accepted and entered into service as the Gewehr 43, renamed Karabiner 43 in April 1944, with production amounting to just over 400,000 between 1943 and 1945. Gewehr 43/Karabiner 43 In 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union as part of Operation Barbarossa. Just prior to the opening of hostilities the Soviet Red Army had started re-arming its infantry, complementing its older bolt-action rifles with the new semi- automatic SVT-38s and SVT-40s. This was a shock to the Germans, who ramped up their own semi-automatic rifle development efforts significantly. The SVT series used a simpler gas-operated mechanism, which was soon emulated by Walther in its successor to the G41(W), producing the Gewehr 43 (or G43). The simpler, sturdier design and mechanism of the G43 made it lighter, easier to produce, more reliable and also much tougher than the Gewehr 41; German mountain troops would use them as ladder rungs during climbing. The addition of a 10-round stamped-steel detachable box magazine was an improvement over the integral box magazine of the G41(W). The Gewehr 43 was intended, like the G41, to be loaded using 5-round stripper clips without removing the magazine. Soldiers armed with the weapon typically carried one standard stripper clip pouch and a Gewehr 43 pouch with two spare magazines. The G43 utilises the same flapper-locked mechanism as its predecessor. The Gewehr 43 was put into production in October 1943, and followed in 1944 by the Karabiner 43 (K43), which was identical to the G43 in every way except for the letter stamped on the side. The name change from Gewehr to Karabiner (carbine) was due to the fact the rifle was actually two centimetres shorter than the standard Karabiner 98k and therefore the term Gewehr (meaning: long rifle) was somewhat unfitting. The Wehrmacht intended to equip each grenadier (infantry) company in the army with 19 G43s, including 10 with scopes, for issue as the company commander saw fit. This issue was never completely achieved. The iron sight line had a hooded pointed-post-type front sight, and a tangent-type rear sight with a V-shaped rear notch.These standard sight lines consisted of somewhat coarse aiming elements, making it suitable for rough field handling, aiming at distant area fire targets and low-light usage, but less suitable for precise aiming at distant or small point targets. It is graduated for 7.92√ó57mm Mauser s.S. Patrone cartridges loaded with 12.8 g (197 gr) s.S. (schweres Spitzgescho√ü ‚Äì \\"heavy pointed bullet\\") ball bullets from in increments. Gewehr 43s were made by Berlin-L√ºbecker Maschinenfabrik in L√ºbeck (weapons coded \\"duv\\", and later \\"qve\\"), Walther (weapons coded \\"AC\\") and the Wilhelm Gustloff-Werke (weapons coded \\"bcd\\"). Walther used its satellite production facilities at Neuengamme concentration camp in addition to its main production facilities at Zella-Mehlis to make the rifles (It does not appear that complete weapons were assembled in the camps, similar to how Radom P35 pistols were assembled in occupied Radom, Poland without their barrels, which were built and installed by Steyr in Austria), Wilhelm Gustloff-Werke used some slave workers to augment its depleted staff from Buchenwald concentration camp. The total production by the end of the war is estimated to have been 402,713 of both models, including at least 53,435 sniper rifles: these G43/K43s were used as designated marksman/sniper weapons, fitted with the Zielfernrohr 43 (ZF 4) telescopic sight with 4√ó magnification. The weapon was originally designed for use with the Schiessbecher rifle grenade launcher (standard on the Karabiner 98k as well) and the Schalld√§mpfer suppressor, however these accessories were deemed unsuccessful in tests and were dropped even before the rifle made it to serial production. The Gewehr 43 stayed in service with the Czechoslovak People's Army for several years after the war. Likewise the East German Border Troops and Volkspolizei were issued reworked G43 rifles, which are recognizable by a sunburst proof mark near the serial number and the serial number engraved by electropencil on removable components. Other details There were many small variations introduced on the G/K43 throughout its production cycle. The important consideration is that no changes were made to the rifle design specifically to coincide with the nomenclature change from Gewehr to Karabiner, with the exception of the letter stamped on the side. Careful study of actual pieces will show that many G-marked rifles had features found on K-marked rifles and vice versa. There is therefore no difference in weight or length between the G43 and the K43. Although G43's have threaded muzzles with removable nuts for a blank adapter, the K43 does not have this feature. Variations in barrel length did exist, but those were the product of machining tolerances, differences between factories, and/or experimental long-barreled rifles. An unknown number of late-war K43 rifles were chambered for the 7.92√ó33mm Kurz cartridge and modified to accept StG44 magazines.Senich, Peter R., The German Assault Rifle, 1935-1945, Paladin Press, Boulder, Colo. USA, 1987 p. 147 K43 with mounting rail Though most G/K43s are equipped with a telescopic sight mounting rail, the vast majority of the rifles were issued in their standard infantry form without a scope. When equipped with a scope, it was exclusively the ZF 4 4-power telescopic sight.Historic Sniper Scopes - A comparative Study - The ZF4 No other known scope/mount combinations were installed by the German military on G/K43's during World War II. Many strange variations have shown up after the war, but all have been proven to be the work of amateur gunsmiths. Rifles with broken- off butts are common, as German soldiers were instructed to render semi- automatic rifles useless when in danger of capture. Ger√§t 03 prototype Ger√§t 03 prototype roller locked action diagram In June 1943 the Mauser Werke's Weapons Research Institute and Weapons Development Group decided to adapt the Gewehr 43 design to use a relatively cheap to produce roller locked action. The production Gewehr 43 used a more expensive to produce and less sturdy Kjellman-style flapper locking system. These locking methods are similar in concept. By December 1943 Mauser Werke's Weapons Research Institute and Weapons Development Group had completed a roller locked prototype rifle designated as the Ger√§t 03. Besides the differing action the Ger√§t 03 prototype resembeled the Gewehr 43. Although the prototype rifle was machined it was designed with pressing and stamping steel components production methods in mind to simplify mass production and keep production costs low. Only a few prototypes were built and the Ger√§t 03 never went into production, but the Ger√§t 03 was put through a 5,000-round endurance trial. The Ger√§t 03 semi- automatic rifle used a fully locked action design with a gas system, using a gas piston to unlock. During test firing the development group noticed an undesirable tendency in the Ger√§t 03 action to exhibit bolt-bounce. It was possible to unintentionally fire the Ger√§t 03 during the bounce phase, at which the action was not fully locked. This opened the Ger√§t 03 action much faster and under much higher pressure than the gas system was supposed to allow. This observation of an harmonics problem in the roller/wedge system led to the idea and development of the intentionally never fully locked roller- delayed blowback action design, which does not require a gas system.Do You Know Your HK‚Äôs Parents?

As a well-educated lawyer he was one of the intellectuals of the Spanish conquest. He was an effective organizer and leader, designed the first legislation for the government of the area, and was its historian. After 1569 he undertook explorations toward the east, searching for the elusive El Dorado, but returned to New Granada in 1573. He has been suggested as a possible model for Cervantes' Don Quixote.E.

He had three younger brothers; Hern√°n and Francisco, who also were conquistadors, and Melchor, and a sister, Andrea. Biography Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada ‚Äì Banco de la Rep√∫blica  Conquest of the Muisca Confederation  De Quesada was an Andalusian lawyer, trained in Granada.\\"Jim√©nez de Quesada, Gonzalo.\\" (2008). Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online School Edition. 20 Oct. 2008. He was appointed chief magistrate in 1535 and second in command for an expedition to present-day Colombia, because in that period he was not in good standing with the people at home because he had just lost an important court case in which his mother's family was economically involved.John A. Crow, The Epic of Latin America, 116‚Äì26 The commander of the expedition, Pedro Fern√°ndez de Lugo (governor of the Canary Islands), had bought the governorship of Colombia and had equipped a fleet and assembled over a thousand men. And so they set sail to Colombia, thinking they would find a very rich land, full of gold and pearls. But when, after two month of navigation, they reached the small coastal settlement of Santa Marta, all they found was a conglomeration of hovels and filthy, disease-ridden colonists who went about dressed in skins or roughly woven and padded cotton clothes made by the natives from surrounding areas. Soon food became scarce and tropical fevers began to smite down the strongest. In 1536, De Quesada (who had no military experience) was chosen by De Lugo to command an expedition to explore into the interior of New Granada, hoping to discover the dreamed El Dorado. A land party under De Quesada, with Hern√°n P√©rez de Quesada (his brother), Juan San Mart√≠n, Juan del Junco (as second in command) L√°zaro Fonte and Sergio Bustillo, struck south from Santa Marta, crossed the Cesar River, and arrived at Tamalameque on the Magdalena River. A support fleet of 6 (or 5) ships had also sailed from Santa Marta with 900 men to navigate the Magdalena. Only two of the vessels actually arrived at Tamalameque, and subsequently returned to Santa Marta with many of De Quesada's men. Continuing up the Magdalena as far as La Tora (Barrancabermeja), De Quesada and his men ascended the Opon River into the cordillera, reaching the Opon hills, Chipata (near V√©lez) (March 1537) and the valley of the Su√°rez River. Passing Lake F√∫quene and Lake Suesca, they reached Nemoc√≥n and Zipaquir√° and finally entered the Muisca Confederation (ruled from Bacat√°, present day Bogot√° and Hunza, today known as Tunja). Only 166 men out of 900 survived, suffering terribly in the jungle: they were forced to eat snakes, lizards, frogs, and even the leather torn from their harnesses and the scabbards of their swords. In Bogot√°, Quesada resigned and called for an election; he was elected captain-general, and threw off the last link that held him to the governor. The Muisca had two rulers. The zipa Tisquesusa, ruled in Bogot√°; the other, the zaque Quemuenchatocha, ruled in Tunja. Taking advantage of a war between the two chiefdoms, Quesada's force subdued Bogot√° and then successfully attacked Tunja. At this point it was time to establish a colony so that the earth itself might properly belong to De Quesada and his men. They chose a spot next to the towering peaks of the east, where the land was high and the rains would quickly run off, where the mountains would protect them from attackers and the jungles below. Quesada placed his right foot on the bare earth and said simply, \\"I take possession of this land in the name of the most sovereign emperor, Charles V.\\" The settlement was at first called New City of Granada, but later they changed it to Santa F√© de Bogot√°, now known simply as Bogot√°, from the Chibcha word Bacat√°, the name of one of the two main cacicazgos of the Muisca Confederation. Quesada remained in the region until the arrival of two expeditions at the end of 1538: Sebasti√°n de Belalc√°zar from Quito, Ecuador, one of the captains of Pizarro who had mutinied against his leader; and Nikolaus Federmann, a German from Venezuela who had rebelled against another German named Hohermuth. The three captains met on the savanna of New Granada. All three wanted to claim New Granada for themselves. In order to resolve their dispute, De Quesada persuaded them to go back to Spain with him and to submit their rival territorial claims to the arbitration of the crown. In July 1539, they sailed for Spain from Cartagena. However, none of them obtained the governorship. De Quesada, after nearly a dozen years of wandering disconsolately through the gaming halls of Europe, returned to New Granada in 1550. Here, he settled down to live for nearly twenty years. He was a respected colonist, becoming the most influential man in the colony. He protected his fellow colonists from the severity of the officials and restrained the encomenderos (large landholders) greed. But his own desire for wealth and gold continued to live inside him.  Later expeditions  In 1569, at the age of 63, De Quesada received a commission to conquer the Llanos to the east of the Colombian cordillera. From Bogot√° in April 1569 with 500 mounted soldiers, 1500 natives, 1100 horses and pack animals, 600 head of cattle, 800 pigs, a large number of negro slaves and 8 priests, he first descended to Mesetas on the upper Guejar River. There most of the livestock was destroyed by a grass fire. De Quesada's expedition then moved to nearby San Juan de los Llanos, where a course was set for east-southeast (by the guide Pedro Soleto), and maintained for the following two years. After a year or so some men returned with Juan Maldonado, reaching San Juan after six months with few survivors. De Quesada eventually reached (San Fernando de) Atabapo at the confluence of the Guaviare and the Orinoco (in December 1571), any further movement requiring the construction of ships. He therefore dejectedly returned to Bogot√°, arriving in December 1572 with only 25 Spaniards, 4 natives, 18 horses and 2 priests. The expedition had been one of the most expensive disasters on record. After a brief period of service in a frontier command (during which he suppressed an indigenous uprising) De Quesada, afflicted with leprosy, overcome with despair at his debts, owing more than 60 thousand ducats, was forced to seek a milder climate and died quietly, aged 70 to 85, in Suesca, an important market town in the New Kingdom of Granada.  Death and legacy  After his death in, Mariquita where he was buried in the Santa Luc√≠a Abbey. His remains were there until 1597 when they were exhumed and transferred to Bogot√°, the city founded by him.

Background Peterson was born in Jamestown, New York on August 28, 1908. His father, Charles Peterson, was an immigrant from Sweden, coming to America as an infant. At the age of ten, C. Peterson lost his father to appendicitis, and he was sent off to work in the mills. After leaving the mills, he earned his living as a traveling salesman. His mother, Henrietta Badar, was an immigrant from Germany, at the age of four, growing up in Rochester, New York. She went to a teachers' college, and was teaching in Elmira, New York, when she met Charles. They married, and moved to Jamestown, a small, industrial city in south-west New York, where C. Peterson took a job at a local furniture factory. Career Peterson's first work on birds was an article \\"Notes from field and study\\" in the magazine Bird-Lore, where he recorded anecdotally two sight records from 1925, a Carolina wren and a titmouse. E.T.Seton's diagram of ducks (1903) In 1934 he published his seminal Guide to the Birds, the first modern field guide, which sold out its first printing of 2‚Äö000 copies in one week, and subsequently went through 6 editions. One of the inspirations for his field guide was the diagram of ducks that Ernest Thompson Seton made in Two Little Savages (1903). He co-wrote Wild America with James Fisher, and edited or wrote many of the volumes in the Peterson Field Guide series, on topics ranging from rocks and minerals to beetles to reptiles. He developed the Peterson Identification System, and is known for the clarity of both his illustrations of field guides and his delineation of relevant field marks.Roger Tory Peterson (Wilsonart Laminate) Paul R.

It is the largest accredited university system specializing in aviation and aerospace. It has numerous online programs and academic programs offered at satellite locations. History On December 17, 1925 Talton Higbee Embry and John Paul Riddle founded the Embry‚ÄìRiddle Company at Lunken Airport in Cincinnati, Ohio. In spring 1926, the company opened the Embry‚ÄìRiddle School of Aviation. Following a merge with the Aviation Corporation (AVCO), the Embry‚ÄìRiddle flying school was closed in 1930. Fritz Hotel in Miami, Florida. Embry‚ÄìRiddle occupied the building prior to moving to Daytona Beach, Florida. In 1939 Riddle, John Graham McKay and wife Isabel re-established the school in Miami, Florida. Keeping the name, they partnered with the University of Miami to provide flight training under the Civilian Pilot Training Program, increasing the number of pilots immediately preceding World War II. Alumni of this school included future President of the United States John F. Kennedy. Following rapid expansion, the school moved to the former Fritz Hotel. Preempting the announced closure of Tamiami Airport where then named Embry‚ÄìRiddle Aeronautical Institute was conducting its flight operations, the school was moved to Daytona Beach in April 1965. Embry‚ÄìRiddle became a nonprofit in 1959, was awarded university status in 1968 and changed its name to today's name in 1970. Embry‚ÄìRiddle started its worldwide program the same year and opened a second residential campus in Prescott, Arizona, in 1978. Though it began as a regional school for pilots and aircraft mechanics, the university enrolls more than 33,000 undergraduate and graduate students. Accreditations and certifications The non-profit university is accredited as a level VI institution by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award degrees at the associate, bachelor, master's, and doctoral levels. The university's programs in aviation maintenance, air traffic management, applied meteorology, aeronautical science, aerospace and occupational safety, flight operations, and airport management are accredited by the Aviation Accreditation Board International (AABI). The bachelor and master's programs in business are accredited by the Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP). All engineering programs are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc. (ABET) The programs in aeronautics, air traffic management, applied meteorology, and aerospace studies are certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In July 2014, the university also became the nation's first FAA-approved training provider for student airline certification. The Embry‚ÄìRiddle Athletics administration announced in July 2014 it was accepted into the NCAA Division II membership process. The transition to full NCAA Division II membership was completed in July 2017. Daytona Beach, Florida campus The Wright Flyer statue is the centerpiece of the Daytona Beach campus. The Jack R. Hunt Memorial Library is visible in the background. Embry‚ÄìRiddle's oldest residential campus () and academic headquarters has been in Daytona Beach, Florida since the move from Miami in 1965. Built adjacent to the Daytona Beach International Airport, the campus is connected to an aircraft ramp owned by the university for flight training. The main campus consists of an aviation complex, academic quad and residence halls surrounding the student center and Jack R. Hunt Aviator Park. The campus has seven residence halls and one off- campus housing complex. Athletic facilities, the Brigadier General William W. Spruance ROTC Center and the ICI Center are on the east side of campus. This university's eastern campus serves 6,740 undergraduates and 781 graduate students from nearly 100 countries. All first-year students live on campus with sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Fifty-two majors are offered at this location for 2020‚Äì21. The engineering physics program at the Daytona Beach campus is among the largest undergraduate engineering physics program in the country and the only one specializing in aerospace.

The Prescott campus offers the only Global Security and Intelligence Studies program in the US. The First Year Experience program is designed to help students transition to college on academic, social, and educational levels. Students in FYE housing are grouped together by major, when possible, and reside with a staff that is specially trained to handle first-year transitional issues. All first-year students who have graduated high school withing 12 months of matriculation are required to live in University housing for their first full academic year. Exceptions are made for students who are over 21 years old, are married or have a dependent, have a permanent address in Yavapai county at time of application to ERAU, or students who have lived on-campus at another institution of higher education for at least two semesters. FYE students reside in the Mingus Mountain Complex or the Thumb Butte Complex and are required to participate in the Dining Services meal program. Embry‚ÄìRiddle's two Air Force ROTC detachments form the largest university-based Air Force commissioning source in the nation. Embry‚ÄìRiddle's AFROTC detachments also produce more commissioned officers, more pilots and other rated officers for the Air Force than any other institution in the nation except the Air Force Academy. Army ROTC also operates a large detachment on the Prescott Campus. The Prescott campus is home to the Golden Eagles Flight Team, which competes in the National Intercollegiate Flying Association. Prescott's Golden Eagles Flight Team has won the regional championship each year for the past 31 years, and the team is also twelve-time National Champions winning in 1993, 1997, 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2012, 2013, 2016, 2017, and 2018.

Designers seek to imitate the flapping-wing flight of birds, bats, and insects. Though machines may differ in form, they are usually built on the same scale as these flying creatures. Manned ornithopters have also been built, and some have been successful. The machines are of two general types: those with engines, and those powered by the muscles of the pilot. Early history Some early manned flight attempts may have been intended to achieve flapping-wing flight, but probably only a glide was actually achieved. They include the purported flights of the 11th-century monk Eilmer of Malmesbury (recorded in the 12th century) and the 9th-century poet Abbas Ibn Firnas (recorded in the 17th century).White, Lynn. \\"Eilmer of Malmesbury, an Eleventh Century Aviator: A Case Study of Technological Innovation, Its Context and Tradition.\\" Technology and Culture, Volume 2, Issue 2, 1961, pp. 97‚Äì111 (97‚Äì99 resp. 100‚Äì101). Roger Bacon, writing in 1260, was also among the first to consider a technological means of flight. In 1485, Leonardo da Vinci began to study the flight of birds. He grasped that humans are too heavy, and not strong enough, to fly using wings simply attached to the arms. He, therefore, sketched a device in which the aviator lies down on a plank and works two large, membranous wings using hand levers, foot pedals, and a system of pulleys. Leonardo da Vinci's ornithopter design In 1841, an ironsmith kalfa (journeyman), Manojlo, who \\"came to Belgrade from Vojvodina\\", attempted flying with a device described as an ornithopter (\\"flapping wings like those of a bird\\"). Refused by the authorities a permit to take off from the belfry of Saint Michael's Cathedral, he clandestinely climbed to the rooftop of the Dumrukhana (import tax head office) and took off, landing in a heap of snow, and surviving. The first ornithopters capable of flight were constructed in France. Jobert in 1871 used a rubber band to power a small model bird. Alphonse P√©naud, Abel Hureau de Villeneuve, and Victor Tatin, also made rubber-powered ornithopters during the 1870s.Chanute, Octave. 1894, reprinted 1998. Progress in Flying Machines. Dover Tatin's ornithopter was perhaps the first to use active torsion of the wings, and apparently it served as the basis for a commercial toy offered by Pichancourt 1889. Gustave Trouv√© was the first to use internal combustion, and his 1890 model flew a distance of 80 meters in a demonstration for the French Academy of Sciences. The wings were flapped by gunpowder charges activating a Bourdon tube. From 1884 on, Lawrence Hargrave built scores of ornithopters powered by rubber bands, springs, steam, or compressed air.W. Hudson Shaw and Olaf Ruhen. 1977. Lawrence Hargrave: Explorer, Inventor & Aviation Experimenter. Cassell Australia Ltd. pp. 53‚Äì160. He introduced the use of small flapping wings providing the thrust for a larger fixed wing; this innovation eliminated the need for gear reduction, thereby simplifying the construction. E.P. Frost's 1902 ornithopter E.P. Frost made ornithopters starting in the 1870s; first models were powered by steam engines, then in the 1900s, an internal- combustion craft large enough for a person was built, though it did not fly.Kelly, Maurice. 2006. Steam in the Air. Ben & Sword Books. Pages 49‚Äì55 are about Frost. In the 1930s, Alexander Lippisch and the National Socialist Flyers Corps of Nazi Germany constructed and successfully flew a series of internal combustion-powered ornithopters, using Hargrave's concept of small flapping wings, but with aerodynamic improvements resulting from the methodical study. Erich von Holst, also working in the 1930s, achieved great efficiency and realism in his work with ornithopters powered by rubber bands. He achieved perhaps the first success of an ornithopter with a bending wing, intended to imitate more closely the folding wing action of birds, although it was not a true variable-span wing-like those of birds.Rubber Band Powered Ornithopters at Ornithopter Zone web site Around 1960, Percival Spencer successfully flew a series of unmanned ornithopters using internal combustion engines ranging from displacement, and having wingspans up to .The complete book of model aircraft, spacecraft, and rockets ‚àí by Louis H. Hertz, Bonanza Books, 1968. In 1961, Percival Spencer and Jack Stephenson flew the first successful engine-powered, remotely piloted ornithopter, known as the Spencer Orniplane.Video provided by Jack Stephenson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS4Yz-VcNes The Orniplane had a wingspan, weighed , and was powered by a -displacement two-stroke engine. It had a biplane configuration, to reduce oscillation of the fuselage.RC History Brought Back to Life: Spencer's Ornithopter, by Faye Stilley, Feb 1999 Model Airplane News Manned flight Otto Lilienthal on August 16, 1894 with his kleiner Schlagfl√ºgelapparat Schmid 1942 Ornithopter Manned ornithopters fall into two general categories: Those powered by the muscular effort of the pilot (human-powered ornithopters), and those powered by an engine. Around 1894, Otto Lilienthal, an aviation pioneer, became famous in Germany for his widely publicized and successful glider flights. Lilienthal also studied bird flight and conducted some related experiments. He constructed an ornithopter, although its complete development was prevented by his untimely death on 9 August 1896 in a glider accident. In 1929, a man-powered ornithopter designed by Alexander Lippisch (designer of the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet) flew a distance of after tow launch. Since a tow launch was used, some have questioned whether the aircraft was capable of flying on its own. Lippisch asserted that the aircraft was actually flying, not making an extended glide. (Precise measurement of altitude and velocity over time would be necessary to resolve this question.) Most of the subsequent human-powered ornithopters likewise used a tow launch, and flights were brief simply because human muscle power diminishes rapidly over time. In 1942, Adalbert Schmid made a much longer flight of a human-powered ornithopter at Munich-Laim. It travelled a distance of , maintaining a height of throughout most of the flight. Later this same aircraft was fitted with a Sachs motorcycle engine. With the engine, it made flights up to 15 minutes in duration. Schmid later constructed a ornithopter, based on the Grunau-Baby IIa sailplane, which was flown in 1947. The second aircraft had flapping outer wing panels.Bruno Lange, Typenhandbuch der deutschen Luftfahrttechnik, Koblenz, 1986. In 2005, Yves Rousseau was given the Paul Tissandier Diploma, awarded by the FAI for contributions to the field of aviation. Rousseau attempted his first human-muscle-powered flight with flapping wings in 1995. On 20 April 2006, at his 212th attempt, he succeeded in flying a distance of , observed by officials of the Aero Club de France. On his 213th flight attempt, a gust of wind led to a wing breaking up, causing the pilot to be gravely injured and rendered paraplegic.FAI web site. A team at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies, headed by Professor James DeLaurier, worked for several years on an engine-powered, piloted ornithopter. In July 2006, at the Bombardier Airfield at Downsview Park in Toronto, Professor DeLaurier's machine, the UTIAS Ornithopter No.1 made a jet-assisted takeoff and 14-second flight. According to DeLaurier,Dr. James DeLaurier's report on the Flapper's Flight July 8, 2006 the jet was necessary for sustained flight, but the flapping wings did most of the work.University of Toronto ornithopter takes off July 31, 2006 On August 2, 2010, Todd Reichert of the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies piloted a human-powered ornithopter named Snowbird. The wingspan, aircraft was constructed from carbon fibre, balsa, and foam. The pilot sat in a small cockpit suspended below the wings and pumped a bar with his feet to operate a system of wires that flapped the wings up and down. Towed by a car until airborne, it then sustained flight for almost 20 seconds. It flew with an average speed of .Human-Powered Ornithoper Flight in Flapping Wings: The Ornithopter Zone Newsletter, Fall 2010. Similar tow-launched flights were made in the past, but improved data collection verified that the ornithopter was capable of self-powered flight once aloft.  Applications for unmanned ornithopters  Practical applications capitalize on the resemblance to birds or insects. Colorado Parks and Wildlife has used these machines to help save the endangered Gunnison sage grouse. An artificial hawk under the control of an operator causes the grouse to remain on the ground so they can be captured for study. Because ornithopters can be made to resemble birds or insects, they could be used for military applications such as aerial reconnaissance without alerting the enemies that they are under surveillance. Several ornithopters have been flown with video cameras on board, some of which can hover and maneuver in small spaces. In 2011, AeroVironment, Inc. demonstrated a remotely piloted ornithopter resembling a large hummingbird for possible spy missions. Led by Paul B. MacCready (of Gossamer Albatross), AeroVironment, Inc. developed a half-scale radio-controlled model of the giant pterosaur, Quetzalcoatlus northropi, for the Smithsonian Institution in the mid-1980s. It was built to star in the IMAX movie On the Wing. The model had a wingspan and featured a complex computerized autopilot control system, just as the full- sized pterosaur relied on its neuromuscular system to make constant adjustments in flight. Researchers hope to eliminate the motors and gears of current designs by more closely imitating animal flight muscles. Georgia Tech Research Institute's Robert C. Michelson is developing a reciprocating chemical muscle for use in microscale flapping-wing aircraft. Michelson uses the term \\"entomopter\\" for this type of ornithopter. SRI International is developing polymer artificial muscles that may also be used for flapping-wing flight. In 2002, Krister Wolff and Peter Nordin of Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, built a flapping-wing robot that learned flight techniques.Winged robot learns to fly New Scientist, August 2002 The balsa- wood design was driven by machine learning software technology known as a steady-state linear evolutionary algorithm. Inspired by natural evolution, the software \\"evolves\\" in response to feedback on how well it performs a given task. Although confined to a laboratory apparatus, their ornithopter evolved behavior for maximum sustained lift force and horizontal movement.Creation of a learning, flying robot by means of Evolution In Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, GECCO 2002 (pp. 1279‚Äì1285). New York, 9‚Äì13 July 2002. Morgan Kaufmann. Awarded \\"Best Paper in Evolutionary Robotics\\" at GECCO 2002. Since 2002, Prof. Theo van Holten has been working on an ornithopter that is constructed like a helicopter. The device is called the \\"ornicopter\\"Ornicopter project and was made by constructing the main rotor so that it would have no reaction torque. In 2008, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol started using a realistic-looking mechanical hawk designed by falconer Robert Musters. The radio-controlled robot bird is used to scare away birds that could damage the engines of airplanes.Article in Dutch newspaper Trouw, partial translation:...\\"The so-called 'Horck', an electrical controllable bird is the newest means to scare birds. Because they can cause much damage to airplanes. (...) ...it is a design by Robert Musters, a falconer from Enschede\\"A picture of the bird with English description In 2012, RoBird (formerly Clear Flight Solutions), a spin-off of the University of Twente, started making artificial birds of prey (called RoBird¬Æ) for airports and agricultural and waste-management industries. Adrian Thomas (zoologist) and Alex Caccia founded Animal Dynamics Ltd in 2015, to develop a mechanical analogue of dragonflies to be used as a drone that will outperform quadcopters. The work is funded by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, the research arm of the British Ministry of Defence, and the United States Air Force. In 2017, researchers of the University of Illinois made an ornithopter that flies like a bat. The device, called Bat Bot (B2) is intended to be used for construction site inspection. Bat wings are fundamentally different from bird wings, and it‚Äôs not just because birds have feathers and bats don‚Äôt. Generally, when roboticists design bird-inspired or insect-inspired robots, they use rigid approximations of the wings, or perhaps a few different rigid parts flexibly interconnected. Bat wings don‚Äôt work like this at all: The underlying structure of a bat‚Äôs wing is made up of ‚Äúa metamorphic musculoskeletal system that has more than 40 degrees of freedom‚Äù and includes bones that actively deform during every wing beat. The wing surface itself is an ‚Äúanisotropic wing membrane skin with adjustable stiffness.‚Äù This level of complexity is what gives bats their unrivaled level of agility, according to the researchers, but it also makes bats wicked hard to turn into robots. The dominant degrees of freedom (DOFs) in the bat flight mechanism are identified and incorporated in B2‚Äôs design by means of a series of mechanical constraints. These biologically meaningful DOFs include asynchronous and mediolateral movements of the armwings and dorsoventral movements of the legs. Also, the continuous surface and elastic properties of bat skin under wing morphing are realized by an ultrathin (56 micrometers) membranous skin that covers the skeleton of the morphing wings. We have successfully achieved autonomous flight of B2 using a series of virtual constraints to control the articulated, morphing wings . Hobby Skyonme Spybird Hobbyists can build and fly their own ornithopters. These range from light-weight models powered by rubber bands, to larger models with radio control. The rubber-band-powered model can be fairly simple in design and construction. Hobbyists compete for the longest flight times with these models. An introductory model can be fairly simple in design and construction, but the advanced competition designs are extremely delicate and challenging to build. Roy White holds the United States national record for indoor rubber- powered, with his flight time of 21 minutes, 44 seconds. Commercial free- flight rubber-band powered toy ornithopters have long been available. The first of these was sold under the name Tim Bird in Paris in 1879. Later models were also sold as Tim Bird (made by G de Ruymbeke, France, since 1969). Commercial radio-controlled designs stem from Percival Spencer's engine- powered Seagulls, developed circa 1958, and Sean Kinkade's work in the late 1990s to present day. The wings are usually driven by an electric motor. Many hobbyists enjoy experimenting with their own new wing designs and mechanisms. The opportunity to interact with real birds in their own domain also adds great enjoyment to this hobby. Birds are often curious and will follow or investigate the model while it is flying. In a few cases, RC birds have been attacked by birds of prey, crows, and even cats. More recent cheaper models such as the Dragonfly from WowWee have extended the market from dedicated hobbyists to the general toy market. Some helpful resources for hobbyists include The Ornithopter Design Manual, book written by Nathan Chronister, and The Ornithopter Zone web site, which includes a large amount of information about building and flying these models. Ornithopters are also of interest as the subject of one of the events in the nationwide Science Olympiad event list. The event (\\"Flying Bird\\") entails building a self-propelled ornithopter to exacting specifications, with points awarded for high flight time and low weight. Bonus points are also awarded if the ornithopter happens to look like a real bird. Aerodynamics As demonstrated by birds, flapping wings offer potential advantages in maneuverability and energy savings compared with fixed-wing aircraft, as well as potentially vertical take-off and landing. It has been suggested that these advantages are greatest at small sizes and low flying speeds,T.J. Mueller and J.D. DeLaurier, \\"An Overview of Micro Air Vehicle Aerodynamics\\", Fixed and Flapping Wing Aerodynamics for Micro Air Vehicle Applications, Paul Zarchan, Editor-in-Chief, Volume 195, AIAA, 2001 but the development of comprehensive aerodynamic theory for flapping remains an outstanding problem due to the complex non-linear nature of such unsteady separating flows. Unlike airplanes and helicopters, the driving airfoils of the ornithopter have a flapping or oscillating motion, instead of rotary. As with helicopters, the wings usually have a combined function of providing both lift and thrust. Theoretically, the flapping wing can be set to zero angle of attack on the upstroke, so it passes easily through the air. Since typically the flapping airfoils produce both lift and thrust, drag-inducing structures are minimized. These two advantages potentially allow a high degree of efficiency. Wing design If future manned motorized ornithopters cease to be \\"exotic\\", imaginary, unreal aircraft and start to serve humans as junior members of the aircraft family, designers and engineers will need to solve not only wing design problems but many other problems involved in making them safe and reliable aircraft. Some of these problems, such as stability, controllability, and durability, are inherent to all aircraft. Other problems specific to ornithopters will appear; optimizing flapping-wing design is only one of them. An effective ornithopter must have wings capable of generating both thrust, the force that propels the craft forward, and lift, the force (perpendicular to the direction of flight) that keeps the craft airborne. These forces must be strong enough to counter the effects of drag and the weight of the craft. Leonardo's ornithopter designs were inspired by his study of birds, and conceived the use of flapping motion to generate thrust and provide the forward motion necessary for aerodynamic lift. However, using materials available at that time the craft would be too heavy and require too much energy to produce sufficient lift or thrust for flight. Alphonse P√©naud introduced the idea of a powered ornithopter in 1874. His design had limited power and was uncontrollable, causing it to be transformed into a toy for children. More recent vehicles, such as the human-powered ornithopters of Lippisch (1929) and Emil Hartman (1959), were capable powered gliders but required a towing vehicle in order to take off and may not have been capable of generating sufficient lift for sustained flight. Hartman's ornithopter lacked the theoretical background of others based on the study of winged flight, but exemplified the idea of an ornithopter as a birdlike machine rather than a machine that directly copies birds' method of flight.\\"Aeroelastic Design and Manufacture of an Efficient Ornithopter Wing \\" Benedict, Moble. 3‚Äì4. The 1960s saw powered unmanned ornithopters of various sizes capable of achieving and sustaining flight, providing valuable real- world examples of mechanical winged flight. In 1991, Harris and DeLaurier flew the first successful engine-powered remotely piloted ornithopter in Toronto, Canada. In 1999, a piloted ornithopter based on this design flew, capable of taking off from level pavement and executing sustained flight. An ornithopter's flapping wings and their motion through the air are designed to maximize the amount of lift generated within limits of weight, material strength and mechanical complexity. A flexible wing material can increase efficiency while keeping the driving mechanism simple. In wing designs with the spar sufficiently forward of the airfoil that the aerodynamic center is aft of the elastic axis of the wing, aeroelastic deformation causes the wing to move in a manner close to its ideal efficiency (in which pitching angles lag plunging displacements by approximately 90 degrees.)\\"The development of an efficient ornithopter wing\\" DeLaurier, J.D. (1993), 152‚Äì162 (accessed May 27, 2014) Flapping wings increase drag and are not as efficient as propeller- powered aircraft. Some designs achieve increased efficiency by applying more power on the down stroke than on the upstroke, as do most birds.\\"An Ornithopter Wing Design\\" DeLaurier, James D. (1994), 10‚Äì18 (accessed November 30, 2010) In order to achieve the desired flexibility and minimum weight, engineers and researchers have experimented with wings that require carbon fiber, plywood, fabric, and ribs, with a stiff, strong trailing edge.\\"The development of an efficient ornithopter wing\\" DeLaurier, J.D. (1993), 152‚Äì162, (accessed May 27, 2014) Any mass located aft of the empennage reduces the wing's performance, so lightweight materials and empty space are used where possible. To minimize drag and maintain the desired shape, choice of a material for the wing surface is also important. In DeLaurier's experiments, a smooth aerodynamic surface with a double-surface airfoil is more efficient at producing lift than a single-surface airfoil. Other ornithopters do not necessarily act like birds or bats in flight. Typically birds and bats have thin and cambered wings to produce lift and thrust. Ornithopters with thinner wings have a limited angle of attack but provide optimum minimum-drag performance for a single lift coefficient.Warrick, Douglas, Bret Tobalske, Donald Powers, and Michael Dickinson. \\"The Aerodynamics of Hummingbird Flight \\". American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics 1‚Äì5. Web. 30 Nov 2010. Although hummingbirds fly with fully extended wings, such flight is not feasible for an ornithopter. If an ornithopter wing were to fully extend and twist and flap in small movements it would cause a stall, and if it were to twist and flap in very large motions, it would act like a windmill causing an inefficient flying situation.Liger, Matthieu, Nick Pornsin-Sirirak, Yu-Chong Tai, Steve Ho, and Chih-Ming Ho. \\"Large-Area Electrostatic-Valved Skins for Adaptive Flow Control on Ornithopter Wings\\" (2002): 247‚Äì250. 30 Nov 2010. A team of engineers and researchers called \\"Fullwing\\" has created an ornithopter that has an average lift of over 8 pounds, an average thrust of 0.88 pounds, and a propulsive efficiency of 54%.DeLaurier, James D. \\"An Ornithopter Wing Design\\" 40. 1 (1994), 10‚Äì18, (accessed November 30, 2010) The wings were tested in a low-speed wind tunnel measuring the aerodynamic performance, showing that the higher the frequency of the wing beat, the higher the average thrust of the ornithopter.

Myerson is the only Jewish woman to win the title to date. Her achievement, in the aftermath of the Holocaust, was seen as an affirmation of the Jewish place in American life. She was a heroine to the Jewish community, where \\"she was the most famous pretty girl since Queen Esther.\\" Myerson made frequent television appearances during the 1950s and 1960s. She was a commissioner in the New York City government and served on presidential commissions from the 1960s through the 1980s, and ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. Her career in public service ended in the late 1980s when she was indicted on bribery and conspiracy charges. She was acquitted after a highly publicized trial. Biography Myerson was born in The Bronx, New York to Louis Myerson and Bella (n√©e Podell), who were Jewish immigrants from Russia. Myerson's father worked as a housepainter, handyman, and carpenter. After Myerson's birth, the family moved from the South Bronx to Shalom Aleichem Houses, a cooperative apartment complex in the northern Bronx.Dworkin, 10-11 She had three siblings: a younger sister, Helen; an elder sister, Sylvia; and a brother, Joseph, who died at the age of three before Myerson was born.Dworkin, pp. 10, 26 Her upbringing emphasized the importance of scholarship, not physical beauty. In addition to tradesmen, her neighbors included poets, writers, and artists. Myerson reached her adult height when she was 12, towered over other children, and has said she felt \\"awkward and gawky\\" during her preadolescence. Myerson recalled one of her worst childhood memories was playing the Popeye character, Olive Oyl, in an elementary school play.Dworkin, p. 36 Myerson began studying piano when she was nine years old and was in the second class of New York's High School of Music and Art in 1937, graduating in 1941.Dworkin, p. 41 She went on to Hunter College, graduating with honors in 1945 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in music. To support herself and her family while in college she gave piano lessons for fifty cents an hour, and worked as a music counselor at a girl's summer camp in Vermont.Dworkin, pp. 1, 57 =Miss America= By the time she was 21, Myerson was tall with \\"luxuriant brown hair\\". Myerson was entered into the Miss New York City competition, without her knowledge, by John C. Pape, a retired steel magnate and amateur photographer who had employed her as a model while she was in college. When Myerson was told about the pageant by her sister, Sylvia, who was acquainted with Pape, Myerson was angry as she felt that the beauty business was \\"embarrassing.\\" However, she was persuaded to compete by Sylvia, and she competed in the swimsuit competition using a borrowed bathing suit.Dworkin, p. 69 Myerson went on to enjoy competing in the pageant, in which she stood out from the other contestants because of her height. On August 15, 1945, the day of Japan's surrender and on VJ Day, she won the competition for the pageant, and moved on to the Miss America competition, partly motivated by the $5,000 scholarship awarded to the winner.Dworkin, p. 72 She later told interviewers she wanted to buy a black Steinway grand piano with the scholarship money. Myerson was the Miss New York entry in the 1945 Miss America pageant, and she competed in the talent portion of the contest by performing the music of Edvard Grieg and George Gershwin. Prior to the competition, she was pressured to use a pseudonym that \\"sounded less Jewish.\\" Despite the news of the Holocaust, which was discovered in parts of Europe four months earlier, America still viewed itself as an Anglo-Saxon Protestant society which manifested hostility towards people of Catholic faith and Jewish ancestry. Myerson refusedPeople & Events: Breaking the Color Line at the Pageant and was subjected to substantial antisemitism. After she won the title on September 8, 1945, three of the pageant's five sponsors withdrew from having her represent their companies as Miss America. With the pageant scholarship money, she paid for graduate studies at Juilliard and Columbia University. An aspiring pianist, she briefly gave recitals on the vaudeville circuit before realizing audiences were more interested in seeing her in a bathing suit. She also played with the New York Philharmonic and appeared at Carnegie Hall. While Myerson was on her year-long tour as Miss America, she encountered \\"No Jews\\" signs posted in places such as hotels and country clubs. Such experiences led her to conduct lectures on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) entitled \\"You Can't Be Beautiful and Hate\\". Myerson became a vocal opponent of antisemitism and racism, and her speaking tour became the highlight of her Miss America reign. At her death, the Religion News Service observed that at the time that she won the pageant, emaciated concentration camp survivors had only just shed their prison clothes. \\"Bess Myerson represented the resurrection of the Jewish body‚Äîthe journey from degradation to beauty.\\" =Television and politics= Ed Koch, Myerson, and Henry Kissinger, 1977 A few years after hearing her speak at an ADL function, television producer Walt Framer hired Myerson for the 1950s game show The Big Payoff. She was the \\"Lady in Mink\\" modeling the grand prize mink coat, and introducing guests and prizes, throughout the 1951 to 1959 network run of the program. Recognized for her wit and hard work, as well as her beauty, in 1954 Myerson was a panelist on the game show The Name's the Same and from 1958 through 1967 a panelist on I've Got a Secret. She regularly substituted for Dave Garroway on the Today Show. She was also a host of the television broadcast of the Miss America pageant from 1954 to 1968. Myerson stepped down from her other commitments in 1969 when appointed by Mayor John V. Lindsay to become the first Commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs.Dworkin, p. 220. Her career as a commercial pitchwoman for a number of products throughout the 1950s and 1960s had led to her becoming a consultant to several consumer products companies. In her consumer affairs position, which she held until 1973, she became a pioneer in consumer protection law. She also served on several presidential commissions on violence, mental health, workplace issues, and hunger in the 1960s and 1970s. Throughout the late 1970s and the beginning of his mayoral ambitions, Myerson was a frequent public companion of then-Congressman Ed Koch and later chaired his successful 1977 campaign for New York City mayor. In 1980, Myerson vied for the Democratic nomination in New York's U.S. Senate race against Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman, Queens District Attorney John J. Santucci, and Lindsay. Myerson lost to Holtzman by a wide margin. In a major surprise, Holtzman was subsequently defeated by Al D'Amato, who had defeated incumbent Senator Jacob Javits in the Republican primary. In 2002, Myerson appeared in the documentary film Miss America as a former Miss America interviewee. =The \\"Bess Mess\\"= After assuming a prominent role in the Koch administration in 1983 as Commissioner of the Department of Cultural Affairs, her career became overshadowed by scandal. She became romantically involved with a married sewer contractor, Carl Andrew Capasso. It soon emerged that Hortense Gabel (the judge involved in Capasso's divorce case) had started socializing with Myerson. Judge Gabel's daughter (Sukhreet) was also hired by Myerson. After Gabel cut Capasso's child support payments, investigations began as to whether or not Gabel had been bribed. In April 1987, after Myerson invoked the Fifth Amendment, she was forced to resign her position with the Koch administration. The scandal became known as the \\"Bess Mess\\". Indicted a year later by the office of then‚ÄìU.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, Myerson, Capasso, and Gabel were tried on federal charges of conspiracy, mail fraud, obstruction of justice, and using interstate facilities to violate state bribery laws, accused of conspiring to reduce Capasso's child support payments. With Sukhreet as the prosecution's chief witness, the main issue at the U.S. District Court trial was whether Myerson's decision to hire Sukhreet constituted bribery. After four months of trial proceedings, all three defendants were acquitted. Capasso was separately convicted of unrelated tax charges. =Personal life= In October 1946, Myerson married Allan Wayne, a recently discharged U.S. Navy captain. They had one daughter, Barbara, born in 1948. The marriage was marred by domestic violence, and the couple divorced after eleven years. Myerson's second marriage was to attorney Arnold Grant, and he legally adopted her daughter in 1962. The couple divorced in the early 1970s. Daughter Barbara later became an actress, director, and screenwriter who is now known as Barra Grant. Before her federal trial began, Myerson was arrested in May 1988 for shoplifting in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania. She pleaded guilty to retail theft and was ordered to pay a fine. Myerson survived ovarian cancer in the 1970s and experienced a mild stroke in 1981, from which she made a full recovery. She moved to Florida in 2002, and later moved to California, where she remained until her death. Myerson donated funds to help build \\"Bessie's Bistro\\" at the Jewish Museum of Florida-FIU in memory of her parents Bella and Louis Myerson who lived in the neighborhood near the Museum. In 2013, she was reported to be suffering from dementia. =Death= Myerson died on December 14, 2014, in Santa Monica, California, at age 90. Her death was not publicly announced and was confirmed by the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office three weeks after she died. Myerson was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in Santa Monica.

The name was coined by English archaeologist William Gowland, and later popularized by Reverend Walter Weston (1861‚Äì1940), an English missionary for whom a memorial plaque is located at Kamik≈çchi, a tourist destination known for its alpine climate. When Gowland coined the phrase, he was only referring to the Hida Mountains, but it now also applies to the Kiso Mountains and Akaishi Mountains.https://www.britannica.com/place/Japanese-Alps  History  The Japanese Alps has a long history before William Gowland established this name. During the 1600s, people tried to discover the river valleys and to map road networks. However, the ridges had never been known and studied. As Kojima Usui later recalled, ‚Äúin those days,... no one knew even the names of the mountains, much less their locations or elevations. To go mountaineering was literally to strike out into the unknown country.‚Äùhttp://muse.jhu.edu.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/article/178069 The first geological survey sheets were issued in 1890. The report mentioned major peaks, but the topography was mostly guesswork. After 1891, Travelers were able to find useful information in Basil Hall Chamberlain and W.B. Mason‚Äôs Handbook, but the information was written in English. However, for decades, the Japanese were climbing these mountains without a comparable guidebook. People did physical exploration over a decade in the 1890s. They divided the mountains into (north, central, and south) depending on how they were conventionally grouped. William Gowland, an English geologist, first thought of this swath of terrain as forming a single coherent landscape, comparable to the European Alps. Gowland's view was further developed by another Englishman and Christian missionary, Walter Weston, who was able ‚Äúto canonize Gowland's geographical conception, deploying it as a de facto proper noun‚Äù http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/article/178069 William Gowland explored several parts of the ranges in the 1860s, being the first documented foreigner to climb two of the highest peaks in the Alps, Yarigatake and Norikura. Gowland was an archaeologist, and he explored these ranges for archaeological reasons. While William Gowland was the first to explore the ranges, Reverend Walter Weston, a Christian missionary, was the first to document his experiences. Gowland was better known for his work as an archaeologist, and he was an archaeologist before an explorer. About twenty years after Gowland's explorations, Weston explored the ranges himself with Gowland's notes on his explorations. Weston not only explored the same ranges that Gowland previously traversed, but also ascended the O Renge, Jonendake, Kasadake, Hodakayama, and other minor mountains. Weston first documented the two main mountain systems distinguishable by geological structure. The first of these he called the \\"China system\\" due to its connection with southeast China from just south of the Japanese archipelago. The second was called the \\"Karafuto system\\", due to the fact that it enters Japan from Karafuto to the north and runs southwest. These two were considered to be the first western explorers of the range, and as a result Weston, with the help of Gowland, popularized and documented different parts of the ranges in an incredibly in- depth manner for others to expand on. Japan is known as an island country in East Asia. The Japanese Alps are the largest nonvolcanic mountains located in Central Honshu Island. The volcanic peaks that tower over central Honshu have long been the object of veneration and pilgrimage. A leading proponent of mountain climbing in Japan would refer a decade later to \\"the majestically towering range that forms the Shinano-Hida border\\" as \\"the so-called 'Japanese Alps.http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/article/178069 Shinano's mountains had long been exploited for raw materials, including timber, fuel, fertilizer, fodder, meat, minerals, and medicines. Most visitors came to the mountain for pilgrimage, especially to the Buddhist temple and the sacred peak of Mount Ontake.  Ranges  Today, the Japanese Alps encompass the Hida Mountains (È£õÈ®®Â±±ËÑà), the Kiso Mountains (Êú®ÊõΩÂ±±ËÑà) and the Akaishi Mountains (Ëµ§Áü≥Â±±ËÑà). These towering ranges include several peaks exceeding in height, the tallest after Mount Fuji. The highest are Mount Hotaka at in north area and Mount Kita at in south area. Mount Ontake is well known as an active volcano, having erupted most recently in 2014. =Northern Alps= The Northern Alps, also known as the Hida Mountains, stretch through Nagano, Toyama and Gifu prefectures. A small portion of the mountains also reach into Niigata Prefecture. It includes the mountains Mount Ontake, Mount Norikura, Mount Yake, Kasumizawadake (ÈúûÊ≤¢Â≤≥), Mount Hotakadake, Mount Yari, Mount J≈çnen, Washibadake (È∑≤ÁæΩÂ≤≥), Suishodake (Ê∞¥Êô∂Â≤≥), Nakedake (È§ìÈ¨ºÂ≤≥), Mount Tate, Kashima Yarigatake (ÈπøÂ≥∂Êßç„É∂Â≤≥), Gory≈´ dake (‰∫îÁ´úÂ≤≥), Mount Shirouma. =Central Alps= The Central Alps, also known as the Kiso Mountains, are located in the Nagano prefecture. It includes the mountains Mount Ena, Anpaiji mountain (ÂÆâÂπ≥Ë∑ØÂ±±), Mount Kusumoyama (Ë∂äÁôæÂ±±), Mount Minamikoma, Mount Utsugi, Mount H≈çken, Mount Kisokoma, Kyogatake (Áµå„É∂Â≤≥). =Southern Alps= The Southern Alps, also known as the Akaishi Mountains, span Nagano, Yamanashi, and Shizuoka prefectures. It includes the mountains Mount H≈ç≈ç, Mount N≈çtori, Mount Aino, Mount Kita, Mount Kaikoma, Mount Senj≈ç, Mount Nokogiri (Akaishi). Glaciers Geographers previously believed that no active glaciers existed in Japan, but the Society of Snow and Ice in Tokyo found this to be false in May 2012. By studying surface flow velocity and snow patches in Mount Tsurugi, they found that certain perennial snow patches have large masses of ice, upwards of 30 meters in thickness. This causes these snow patches to be classified as active glaciers, and as of today there are three active glaciers in the Japanese Alps, and all of Japan.http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=geh&AN;=2013-003248&site; =ehost-live See also *Tourism in Japan References Further reading *  External links  * Official website * Category:Mountain ranges of Japan Category:Tourist attractions in Japan ","title":"Japanese Alps"},{"id":"332944","text":"Tocharian may refer to: * Tocharians, an ancient people who inhabited the Tarim Basin in Central Asia * Tocharian languages, two (or perhaps three) Indo-European languages spoken by those people * Tocharian alphabet, the script used to write the Tocharian languages Category:Language and nationality disambiguation pages ","title":"Tocharian"},{"id":"332945","text":"Charting may refer to: *Chart, graphical representation of data *Nautical chart, process of building a chart of water bodies *Technical analysis, term used in finance *Music chart, ordered list of music sales See also *Chart (disambiguation) ","title":"Charting"},{"id":"332946","text":"Eber ( ‚Äì  ø·∏ñ·∏áer; ‚Äì √âber; ‚Äì  øƒÄbir) is an ancestor of the Israelites and the Ishmaelites according to the \\"Table of Nations\\" in the Book of Genesis () and the Books of Chronicles ().

A number of mediaeval scholars such as Michael the Syrian, Bar Hebraeus, and Agapius the Historian mentioned the prevailing view, that the Hebrews had received their name from Eber, while also pointing out that according to others, the name \\"Hebrew\\" meant \\"those who cross\\", in reference to those who crossed the Euphrates river with Abram from Ur to Harran, and then to the land of Canaan. In some translations of the New Testament, he is referred to once as Heber ([Luke 3:35] ...the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Heber, the son of Salah...); however, he should not be confused with the Heber of the Old Testament (different Hebrew spelling, ◊ó◊ë◊®), grandson of Asher (Genesis 46:17).  Hebrew language  13th century Muslim historian Abu al-Fida relates a story, noting that the patriarch Eber (great-grandson of Shem) refused to help with the building of the Tower of Babel, so his language was not confused when it was abandoned. He and his family alone retained the original human language (a concept referred to as lingua humana in Latin), Hebrew, a language named after Eber.Morris Jastrow, Ira Maurice Price, Marcus Jastrow, Louis Ginzberg, & Duncan B.

Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963. He unexpectedly captured the shooting in a home movie while filming the presidential limousine and motorcade as it traveled through Dealey Plaza. The film is regarded as the most complete footage of the assassination. Background Zapruder was born into a Ukrainian-Jewish family in the city of Kovel, the Russian Empire (now Ukraine), the son of Israel Zapruder. He received only four years of formal education in Ukraine. In 1909, his father left for America. In 1918, Abraham Zapruder left Kovel for Warsaw with his family. At some point, Zapruder's brother was pulled off a train and murdered in front of his family, apparently by Polish guards. In 1920, his family emigrated to the United States, settling in Brooklyn, New York where they were reunited with Israel Zapruder.Passenger list, S.S. Rotterdam, Port of New York, July 12, 1920, sheet 73, lines 4‚Äì7. Zapruder's father Israel had emigrated in advance of the rest of the family. Studying English at night, he found work as a clothing pattern maker in Manhattan's garment district. In 1933, he married Lillian Sapovnik (1913‚Äì1993), with whom he had two children.Richard B. Trask, National Nightmare on Six Feet of Film (Yeoman Press, 2005), p. 18. . Zapruder was a Freemason and an Inspector-General (33rd degree) of the Scottish Rite. In 1941, Zapruder moved to Dallas, Texas, to work for Nardis, a local sportswear company. In 1949, he co-founded Jennifer Juniors, Inc., producing the Chalet and Jennifer Juniors brands of dresses.Betty Temple Howell, Southwest Styles: CASUAL OR DRESSY Keep It Smart!

From the summer of 1953 to April 1954, Zapruder worked at Nardis side by side with Jeanne LeGon.Warren Commission Hearings, volume 9, p. 298, Testimony of Mrs. George S. de Mohrenschildt. His Jennifer Juniors offices were on the fourth floor of the Dal-Tex Building,Testimony of Abraham Zapruder, Clay Shaw Trial Transcripts, page 7 of 101, AARC the assassination archives and research center. across the street from the Texas School Book Depository. Witness to Kennedy assassination =Filming of assassination= US National Archives At the time of the assassination, Zapruder was an admirer of President Kennedy and considered himself a Democrat. Zapruder had originally planned to film the motorcade carrying President Kennedy through downtown Dallas on November 22, but he decided not to film the event because it had been raining that morning. When he arrived at work that morning without his camera, Zapruder's assistant insisted that he retrieve it from home before going to Dealey Plaza because the weather had cleared. Zapruder's movie camera was an 8 mm Bell & Howell Zoomatic Director Series Model 414 PD--top of the line when it was purchased in 1962. Zapruder had planned to film the motorcade from his office window but decided to choose a more optimal spot in Dealey Plaza where the motorcade would be passing. He chose to film on top of a concrete abutment which extends from a retaining wall that was part of the John Neely Bryan concrete pergola on the grassy knoll north of Elm Street, in Dealey Plaza. Zapruder's secretary, Marilyn Sitzman, offered to assist Zapruder as he suffered from vertigo and was apprehensive about standing on the abutment alone. While Sitzman stood behind Zapruder and held his coat to steady him, he began filming the presidential motorcade as it turned from Houston Street onto Elm Street in front of the Book Depository. Zapruder's film captured 26.6 seconds of the traveling motorcade carrying President Kennedy on 486 frames of Kodak Kodachrome II safety film. Zapruder's film captured the fatal head shot that struck President Kennedy as his limousine passed almost directly in front of Zapruder and Sitzman's position, from the center of Elm Street.Bugliosi 2008 p.453 Zapruder would later recall that he immediately knew that President Kennedy's wound was fatal as he saw the president's head \\"...explode like a firecracker.\\" Walking back to his office amid the confusion following the shots, Zapruder encountered The Dallas Morning News reporter Harry McCormick, who was standing near Zapruder and noticed he was filming the motorcade. McCormick was acquainted with Agent Forrest Sorrels of the Secret Service's Dallas office, and offered to bring Sorrels to Zapruder's office. Zapruder agreed and returned to his office. McCormick later found Sorrels outside the Sheriff's office at Main and Houston, and together they went to Zapruder's office. Zapruder agreed to give the film to Sorrels on the condition it would be used only for investigation of the assassination. The three then took the film to the television station WFAA to be developed. After it was realized that WFAA was unable to develop Zapruder's footage, the film was taken to Eastman Kodak's Dallas processing plant later that afternoon where it was immediately developed. As the Kodachrome process requires different equipment for duplication than for simple development, Zapruder's film was not developed until around 6:30 p.m. The original developed film was taken to the Jamieson Film Company, where three additional copies were exposed; these were returned to Kodak around 8 p.m. for processing. Zapruder kept the original, plus one copy, and gave the other two copies to Sorrels, who sent them to Secret Service headquarters in Washington. =Television interview= While at WFAA, Zapruder described on live television the assassination of President Kennedy: =Sale of rights= Late that evening, Zapruder was contacted at home by Richard Stolley, an editor at Life magazine (and first editor of the future People magazine). They arranged to meet the following morning to view the film, after which Zapruder sold the print rights to Life for $50,000. Stolley was representing Time/Life on behalf of Publisher Charles Douglas Jackson. The following day (November 24), Life purchased all rights to the film for a total of $150,000 (approximately $ today).The Inflation Calculator , using the United States Consumer Price Index. The night after the assassination, Zapruder said that he had a nightmare in which he saw a booth in Times Square advertising \\"See the President's head explode!\\"Richard Stolley, \\"What Happened Next... ,\\" Esquire, November 1973, pp. 134‚Äì135. He determined that, while he was willing to make money from the film, he did not want the public to see the full horror of what he had seen. Therefore, a condition of the sale to Life was that frame 313, showing the fatal shot, would be withheld.The Warren Commission Report reproduced frame 313 in 1964, and Life magazine eventually did as well, in its issue of October 2, 1964, p. 45. Although he made a profit from selling the film, he asked that the amount he was paid not be publicly disclosed. He later donated $25,000 (about $ today) of the money he was paid to the widow of Officer J. D. Tippit, a Dallas police officer who was shot and killed by Lee Harvey Oswald 45 minutes after President Kennedy was killed. In 1975, Time, Inc. (which owned Life magazine) sold the film back to the Zapruder family for $1. In 1978, the Zapruders allowed the film to be stored at the National Archives and Records Administration where it remains. In 1999, the Zapruders donated the copyright of the film to the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza. =Testimony= In his testimony to the Warren Commission, Zapruder was asked for his impression regarding the direction of the shots: Zapruder added that he had assumed the shots came from behind him because the President's head went backwards from the fatal shot, and also that the wound on the side of the President's head was facing that direction. He also said he believed it because police officers ran to the area behind him.Testimony of Abraham Zapruder, Warren Commission Hearings and Exhibits, vol. 7, p. 572. He broke down and wept as he recalled the assassination,Testimony of Abraham Zapruder, Warren Commission Hearings and Exhibits, vol. 7, p. 571. and did so again at the 1969 trial of Clay Shaw.Testimony of Abraham Zapruder, State of Louisiana v.

Other notable people who claimed to have taken pictures or films of the event The following individuals were not interviewed by the Warren Commission. *Gordon Arnold ‚Äì He claimed to have filmed the motorcade as well as the Badge man, who he said confiscated his film, from the top of the grassy knoll. Arnold's claims have been contested due to inconsistencies over time as well as incongruities with the film record and the testimony of various witnesses. *Mary Moorman ‚Äì She took a Polaroid picture at the moment of the fatal shot, which some have claimed to depict a puff of white smoke in front of the supposed Badge man at the top of the grassy knoll. *Babushka Lady ‚Äì She is an unknown lady wearing a scarf who apparently had a camera in front of her face during the event. In popular culture * Paul Giamatti portrays Zapruder in the 2013 film Parkland, which dramatizes Zapruder's life on the weekend of the assassination. * Australian actor, comedian, presenter and film producer Andrew Denton named his production company, Zapruder's Other Films. * Timequest, a 2000 film in which Kennedy's assassination was prevented by a time traveler, had Zapruder (Andrew Dunn) instead aiming his camera at the fence behind the grassy knoll and filming Robert F. Kennedy after a would be second gunman was killed by his men, then having his footage confiscated by a secret service agent, but eventually obtained by a movie director and shown on television several decades later.

Retrieved: 2014-09-18. is a tube that can be inserted into the body, often for the delivery or removal of fluid or for the gathering of samples. In simple terms, a cannula can surround the inner or outer surfaces of a trocar needle thus extending the effective needle length by at least half the length of the original needle. It is also called an intravenous (IV) cannula. Its size mainly ranges from 14 to 24 gauge. Different-sized cannula have different colours as coded. Decannulation is the permanent removal of a cannula (extubation),Children with Tracheotomies Resource Guide, by Marilyn K. Kertoy, page 15 (Google book search) especially of a tracheostomy cannula, once a physician determines it is no longer needed for breathing.  Medicine  Cannulae normally come with a trocar inside. The trocar is a needle, which punctures the body in order to get into the intended space. Many types of cannulae exist: Intravenous cannulae are the most common in hospital use. A variety of cannulae are used to establish cardiopulmonary bypass in cardiac surgery. A nasal cannula is a piece of plastic tubing that runs under the nose and is used to administer oxygen. = Intravenous (IV) cannulation = Intravenous cannula A venous cannula is inserted into a vein, primarily for the administration of intravenous fluids, for obtaining blood samples and for administering medicines. An arterial cannula is inserted into an artery, commonly the radial artery, and is used during major operations and in critical care areas to measure beat-to-beat blood pressure and to draw repeated blood samples. Insertion of the venous cannula is a painful procedure that can lead to anxiety and stress. Use of a vapocoolant (cold spray) immediately before cannulation reduces pain during the procedure, without increasing the difficulty of cannulation. Complications may arise in the vein as a result of the cannulation procedure, the four main groups of complication are: * hematoma: a collection of blood, which can result from failure to puncture the vein when the cannula is inserted or when the cannula is removed. The selection of an appropriate vein and gently applying pressure slightly above the insertion point on removal of the cannula may prevent this. * infiltration: when infusate enters the subcutaneous tissue instead of the vein. To prevent this, a cannula with accurate trim distances may be used. It is essential to fix the cannula in place firmly. * embolism: this can be caused by air, a thrombus, or fragment of a catheter breaking off and entering the venous system. It can cause a pulmonary embolism. Air emboli can be avoided by making sure that there is no air in the system. A thromboembolism can be avoided by using a smaller cannula. * phlebitis: an inflammation of the vein resulting from mechanical or chemical irritation or from an infection. Phlebitis can be avoided by carefully choosing the site for cannulation and by checking the type of infusate used. = Nasal cannulation and oral-nasal cannulation = Drawing of a nasal cannula A nasal cannula or an oral‚Äìnasal cannula consists of a flexible tube, usually with multiple short, open-ended branches for comfortable insertion into the nostrils and/or mouth, and may be used for the delivery of a gas (such as pure oxygen), a gas mixture (as, for example, during anesthesia), or to measure airflow into and out of the nose and/or mouth. = Tracheotomy tube = The removal of a tracheotomy tube is referred to as decannulation. Veterinary use A cannula is used in an emergency procedure to relieve pressure and bloating in cattle and sheep with ruminal tympany, due most commonly to their accidentally grazing wilted legume or legume-dominant pastures, particularly alfalfa, ladino, and red and white clover.Diseases of the Ruminant Forestomach : Bloat, Merck Veterinary Manual Cannulas are a component used in the insertion of the Verichip. Much larger cannulas are used to research about the digestive system of cows. Aesthetic medicine and anti-ageing In aesthetic medicine, a blunt-tip cannula or microcannula (also called smooth tip microcannula, blunt tipped cannula, or simply microcannula) is a small tube with an edge that is not sharp and an extrusion port or pore near the tip which is designed for atraumatic subdermal injections of fluids or gels. Depending on the size of the internal diameter, it can be used either for the injection of cosmetic wrinkle fillers like hyaluronic acid, collagen, poly-L-lactic acid, CaHA, etc., or for fat transfer (Liposuction). The advantage of using these is that they are less painful, have less risk of bruising, have less swelling, and a better safety profile. Accidental intravascular injections are more difficult with blunt-tip microcannulas, reducing the risk of skin necrosis, ulcers, and embolization to the retinal artery which can result in blindness. Indeed, in May 2015, the USA issued a warning of these risks as an FDA Safety Communication on the \\"Unintentional Injection of Soft Tissue Filler Into Blood Vessels In the Face\\". In January 2012, the \\"Dermasculpt\\" microcannula was approved by the FDA for use in the United States for use with soft tissue fillers followed by the \\"Magic Needle\\", \\"Softfil\\", \\"TSK by Air-Tite\\", and \\"Sculpt-face\\". The primary structural differences between microcannulas is the distance of the extrusion port or pore from the tip (closer is more precise), the bluntness of the tip (tapered blunt tip is easier for entry), and the flexibility of the shaft (enough flexibility to move around sensitive structures but enough rigidity for precise placement. Since microcannula tips are blunt, a Pilot or Introducer needle is required for entry through the skin and the technique is to thread the microcannula through this tiny opening. Microcannula cosmetic injection techniques have been developed on how to best place cosmetic wrinkle fillers such as the Long MicroCannula Double Cross-Hatched Fan and the Wiggle Progression techniques. In April 2016, the concept of the use of microcannula to inject more than cosmetic fillers was first published. The technique of Microcannula Injected Local Anesthesia (MILA) was described on the use of microcannula to inject local anesthesia with less pain, bruising, and swelling. Also introduced were Accelerated Healing After Platelet-Rich Plasma (AHA-PRP), Accelerated Healing After Platelet-Rich Fibrin Matrix (AHA-PRFM), and the use of microcannula to dissolve Sculptra nodules. . Body piercing Cannulae are used in body piercing when using a standard IV needle (usually between 18GA and 12GA, although may be as large as 0GA, in which case the procedure is known as dermal punching and uses a biopsy punch without a cannula), and for inserting hooks for suspensions. During piercing, the fistula is created by inserting the needle. The needle is then removed, leaving the cannula in place, which is sometimes trimmed down. The cannula is then removed and sterile jewelry is inserted into the fistula simultaneously, in order to minimise trauma to the fresh fistula caused by insertion of blunt- ended jewelry. Non-medical use Air-sensitive cannula used in synthetic chemistryIn biological research, a push-pull cannula, which both withdraws and injects fluid, can be used to determine the effect of a certain chemical on a specific cell. The push part of the cannula is filled with a physiological solution plus the chemical of interest and is then injected slowly into the local cellular environment of a cell. The pull cannula then draws liquid from the extracellular medium, thus measuring the cellular response to the chemical of interest. This technique is especially used for neuroscience. In general aviation, a cannula refers to a piece of plastic tubing that runs under the nose and is used to administer oxygen in non-pressurized aircraft flying above 10,000 feet sea level. In synthetic chemistry, a cannula refers to a piece of stainless steel or plastic tubing used to transfer liquids or gases from one vessel to another without exposure to air.

The museum village contains a collection of pioneer artifacts from the town of Washington, Arkansas, which is a former pioneer settlement along the Southwest Trail. Walking interpretive tours are available throughout the 54 buildings. Washington served as a major trading point along the Southwest Trail, evolving into the Hempstead county seat and later the capital of Arkansas from 1863 to 1865 when Little Rock was threatened during the Civil War. The original plat of Washington was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 as the Washington Historic District. During the 1820s and 1830s, Washington was a stopover for travelers going to Texas. It was originally the county seat of Hempstead County until a new courthouse was completed in Hope, which was designated the seat of government in 1939. The park emphasizes regional 19th century history from 1824 to 1889.Brochure entitled \\"Programs, Tours, and Activities, Historic Washington State Park, August 7, 2008 It is located in southwestern Arkansas east of Texarkana and near the entrance to Interstate 30. History of Old Washington The Southwest Trail ran from St. Louis, Missouri, to the Red River port of Fulton in Hempstead County some twelve miles from Washington. At the time, the Red River was the border between the United States and Mexico. The trail was a route taken by people headed to Mexican Texas. William B. Travis, Sam Houston, and Davy Crockett each separately traveled through Washington on their way to Texas. In the early 1830s until the 1840s, bands of Cherokee and Choctaw travelled through Old Washington on their way to Indian Territory under the Indian removal policies of U.S. President Andrew Jackson. In 1846, Washington was a mustering point for Arkansas troops marching south to fight under General Zachary Taylor in the Mexican War. On February 14, 1820, Washington was authorized for a post office. That facility remains the oldest continuous postal operation west of the Mississippi River. A new postal building was dedicated on May 29, 1988, by then U.S. Senator David Hampton Pryor.Hope Star, Hope, Arkansas, May 30, 1988 Washington became a town on George Washington's birthday, February 22, 1824. From 1863-1865, Old Washington was the site of the Confederate capitol of Arkansas after the fall of Little Rock to Union forces. The original Arkansas Confederate capital, where the refugee government fled, still exists in the park. It is a part of the Camden Expedition Sites, named in part for the town of Camden, Arkansas, in southern Arkansas. In the early 1864, Washington was threatened by Union forces under the command of Major General Frederick Steele which moved south along the Military Road en route to Shreveport, Louisiana. A Confederate force under the command of Major General Sterling Price blocked Steele's army. The two forces engaged in battle on April 10, 1864, some fourteen miles north of Washington. Steele was forced to move east to Camden, a movement which spared Washington from invasion. This encounter was known as the Skirmish at Prairie D'Ane. Many wounded soldiers were brought to Washington for medical treatment. Several buildings, including the Washington Baptist Church, were turned into hospitals to treat the wounded. Seventy-four unknown Confederate soldiers from this battle were buried in a mass grave in the Washington Presbyterian Cemetery. This Methodist Church at Historic Washington State Park is the oldest church of that denomination in Arkansas. In the early 1870s, the Cairo and Fulton Railroad built a line through southwest Arkansas which bypassed Washington. Instead the depot was nine miles away and became the origin of the city of Hope, incorporated on April 8, 1875. Fire swept through Washington on July 3, 1875 and destroyed much of the business district. A second fire occurred on January 21, 1883. Most of the businesses in Washington relocated to Hope, which proposed that it supersede Washington as the county seat. Several fraudulent elections were held over the matter. The Arkansas Supreme Court intervened and, in a ruling in May 1939, declared Hope the county seat. In 1958, the Pioneer Washington Restoration Foundation began preserving the unique buildings and sites that currently lie within the park. The park was established in 1965 and opened eight years later. The Southwest Regional Archives was established there in 1978. Since that time, more than 200,000 artifacts related to 19th century life have been recovered in the park and is the site of ongoing archaeological research on small-town life. The historic buildings provide excellent examples of the architectural styles popular in the 19th century American South. Examples on display are Southern Greek Revival, Federal architecture, Gothic Revival, Italianate, and the rough-hewn timber or brace-frame construction of the frontier. Visitors follow plank board sidewalks along streets that have never been paved. The largest magnolia tree in Arkansas, planted in 1839, also graces the town. Everything within the original 1824 boundaries of the town are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Major buildings 1874 Courthouse Park tours begin at the previous Hempstead County Courthouse, which was constructed in 1874 and is maintained as the museum headquarters and visitors center. On the top floor, one may meditate in the courtroom where trials and hearings were formerly held. After the county seat was moved to Hope, the 1874 courthouse was used as a school beginning in 1914. A gym was built during the 1930s by the Works Progress Administration. Both are still used for meeting rooms and group rental facilities. *John Dyer Trimble House ‚Äì Heirs of John D. Trimble donated their family home and furnishings to the museum in 1978. The artifacts highlight three generations who lived in the house in Hempstead County. *Clardy/Goodlet Kitchen ‚Äì This detached structure is believed to be one of the last original such kitchens in the state. *Royston Log House ‚Äì A demonstration of living in the 1830s‚Äì1860s.

Edwards Weapon Museum, Historic Washington State Park, Washington Arkansas *Washington Print Museum ‚Äì Interprets printing equipment and techniques from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The print shop is also run by Gary White. *1836 Courthouse - The original Hempstead Courthouse was in 1844 the scene of the first murder trial in Hempstead County. The courthouse was chosen by Governor Harris Flanagin during the Civil War as the Confederate capital of Arkansas. By 1858, Washington had outgrown the courthouse, and a new facility was proposed in 1872. When the second courthouse opened in 1874, the previous structure became the house of the county clerk. In time it was boarded up. Presbyterian Church at Historic Washington Park has a cemetery with a mass grave of Confederate soldiers. In 1929, the United Daughters of the Confederacy secured state funding to restore the 1836 Hempstead Courthouse. This was the first restoration money ever appropriated by the Arkansas General Assembly. The building now included in Washington Park has paintings of Confederate icons J.E.B. Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, and Pierre G.T. Beauregard on the walls.Exhibit at 1836 Courthouse, Historic Washington State Park In 1958, a group of Washington citizens formed the Pioneer Washington Restoration Foundation to preserve the old structures and interpret the history of Washington. They operated tours of some of the historic homes for fifteen years. In 1973, they invited the Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism to assist in the preservation and interpretation of the village. The foundation donated property, buildings, and antiques, and Old Washington Historic State Park opened as the then thirty-fourth Arkansas state park on July 1, 1973. Blacksmith shop *Block-Catts House ‚Äì Built by Abraham Block, a merchant in Washington, this home, elegant in its day, is a rare Federal-style structure in southwest Arkansas. Block, an immigrant from Bohemia, had twelve children. Block first came to the port of New Orleans before heading northward. He was the first Jewish settler in Arkansas. His house was the oldest in Washington and the oldest two-story residence in the state. The house had a grand piano and impressive dining hall. Block died in 1857. *Blacksmith Shop ‚Äì The shop was built by the Pioneer Washington Restoration Foundation in 1960 as an interpretation center. It has two working forges. In 1831, James Black, the best known blacksmith in Washington, forged one of the original Bowie knives for the frontiersman James Bowie. The shop was dedicated to the memory of Thomas Hamilton Simms of the Hempstead Rifles. 1914 school *Simon Sanders House and Urban Farmstead ‚Äì A program entitled \\"Her Work Is Never Done\\" presented at the Sanders House is a demonstration of the endless tasks assigned to a household slave during the antebellum years in Washington.

It is located on the far eastern end of the city. Then-Governor Mike Huckabee attended the dedication.Exhibit at Washington High School restoration in Washington State Park Museum information Surrey rides are available on special occasions. The Williams Tavern Restaurant offers country cooking. Part of the funding for Arkansas state parks such as Washington comes from a .125-cent sales tax allocated for Game/Fish and Parks/Tourism. The park provides a variety of events for local residents and visitors including demonstrations and workshops on blacksmithing, weaving, quilting, sewing, candlemaking, forging, and harness driving. Historic Washington offers Civil War weekends and reenactments, the Five Trails Rendezvous (commemorating the origin of five Native American trails in the region) held in February, the annual jonquil festival in March, and a Christmas festival and Victorian era Christmas ball. The park is decorated for Christmas each December. At Historic Washington, the American Bladesmith Society operates the only bladesmithing college in the United States. The program, affiliated with Texarkana College, claims to be the only school in the world dedicated to the art of making knives and swords. Restoring Old Washington Among the leading figures in the restoration of Old Washington was James H. Pilkinton of Hope, who served as president of the Pioneer Washington Restoration Foundation twice between 1959 and 1990. Others involved in the restoration are Parker O. Westbrook, a former aide to the late U.S. Senator J. W. Fulbright, and Westbrook's sister, Lucille. Old Washington has been called the \\"Colonial Williamsburg of the Southwest\\" or \\"Colonial Williamsburg of Arkansas\\", in reference to the Colonial Williamsburg restoration in Virginia which opened in 1957 courtesy of the Rockefeller family. Collections Historic Washington houses the Southwest Arkansas Regional Archives which is the primary center for historical and genealogical research in the region. The archives contain rare books, court documents, newspapers, census information, photographs, scrapbooks, sheet music, and assorted family histories.

She has been called \\"the most famous 19th-century woman inventor\\". She was working in a paper-bag factory when she devised a new way to put together the bags. She founded the Eastern Paper Bag Company in 1870, creating paper bags for groceries similar in form to the ones that would be used in later generations. Early life Knight was born on February 14, 1838, in York, Maine to James Knight and Hannah Teal. After her father died when she was young, Knight's family moved to Manchester, New Hampshire. She received a basic education, but left school with her siblings to work at a cotton mill. At the age of 12, Knight witnessed an accident at the mill where a worker was stabbed by a steel-tipped shuttle that shot out of a mechanical loom. Within weeks, she invented a safety device for the loom that was later adopted by other Manchester mills. The device was never patented and the exact nature of it is unknown, though it may have been either a device to stop the loom when the shuttle thread broke or a guard to physically block a flying shuttle. Health problems precluded Knight from continuing to work at the cotton mill. In her teens and early 20s she held several jobs, including home repair, photography, and engraving. Career Knight moved to Springfield, Massachusetts in 1867 and was hired by the Columbia Paper Bag Company. In 1868, Knight invented a machine that folded and glued paper to form the flat-bottomed brown paper bags familiar to shoppers today. Knight built a wooden model of the device, but needed a working iron model to apply for a patent. Charles Annan, who was in the machine shop where Knight's iron model was being built, stole her design and patented the device. Knight filed a successful patent interference lawsuit and was awarded the patent in 1871. Improvement in Paper-Bag Machines, July 11, 1871. With a Massachusetts business partner, Knight established the Eastern Paper Bag Co. and received royalties. Her many other inventions included lid removing pliers, a numbering machine, a window frame and sash, patented in 1894, and several devices relating to rotary engines, patented between 1902 and 1915. Knight never married and died on October 12, 1914, at the age of 76. A plaque recognizing her as the \\"first woman awarded a U.S. patent\\" and holder of 87 U.S. patents hangs on the Curry Cottage at 287 Hollis St in Framingham. However, Knight was not actually the first: either Mary Kies or Hannah Slater has that honor. Knight was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006. The original bag-making machine is in the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C.

The league currently consists of 14 teams. The league was founded in 1975, and while Swedish ice hockey champions have been crowned through various formats since 1922, the title, as well as the Le Mat Trophy, have been awarded to the winner of the SHL playoffs since the league's inaugural 1975‚Äì76 season. As of 2010‚Äì11, the SHL was the world's most evenly matched professional ice hockey league. During the 2011‚Äì12 season, the SHL was the most well attended ice hockey league in Europe, averaging 6,385 spectators per game, however in 2013‚Äì14, the SHL was third best in Europe, with an attendance average of 5,978. The SHL was the second most popular sports team league within Sweden, after the football league Allsvenskan, which in the 2013 season had an average attendance of 7,627.http://www.worldfootball.net/attendance/swe- allsvenskan-2013/1/ The league was founded in 1975 as Elitserien (in English often called the Swedish Elite League or SEL), and initially featured 10 teams, though this was expanded to 12 for the 1987‚Äì88 season. The league was renamed the SHL in 2013, and in 2014, a number of format changes were announced, including an expansion to 14 teams to be finalized prior to the 2015‚Äì16 season, and a new format for promotion from and relegation to HockeyAllsvenskan, the second tier league. History The Swedish Ice Hockey Championship was awarded for the first time in 1922, only two years after ice hockey was introduced in Sweden by the American film director Raoul Le Mat. At this point, the Swedish Championships were held as a separate tournament. It was not until the 1952‚Äì53 season that the championship was awarded to the winner of the top-tier hockey league, which at the time was Division I. =Expansion= The inaugural Elitserien season began on 5 October 1975, with the league consisting of 10 teams, each playing one another four times‚Äîtwo at home and two on the road‚Äîfor a total of 36 games. There has been extensive discussion about the number of teams in the SHL. The league had 12 teams for over 20 years since an expansion from 10 teams in 1987, however, there was general agreement among hockey experts that the league needed to be expanded by at least two more teams. They meant that, apart from just the economic situation for some of the clubs, the competition from HockeyAllsvenskan had shown that more teams were needed in the top-tier league SHL. On 13 March 2014, the SHL and HockeyAllsvenskan announced that the SHL would be expanded to 14 teams, starting in the 2015‚Äì16 season. To make this change happen, at least two HockeyAllsvenskan teams would be promoted to the SHL in the 2014‚Äì15 season. =European-level play= In 2009, H√•kan Loob, the general manager of F√§rjestad BK, sent a letter to Alexander Medvedev, the owner and president of the Russian Kontinental Hockey League, on behalf of five SHL teams ‚Äì F√§rjestad, Fr√∂lunda, Djurg√•rden, Link√∂ping and HV71 ‚Äì that were reportedly \\"interested in discussing the future of European hockey\\". It was believed that these five teams had intended to leave the SHL league after the 2009‚Äì10 season; they terminated their shareholders' agreements with Hockeyligan, the name at that time for the SHL's interest organisation. The teams also formed an interest group to investigate the possibility of forming a continental hockey league spanning several European countries. These plans were abandoned in November 2011, however, with Fr√∂lunda's chairman expressing hopes for the future of the European Trophy (which was disbanded with the formation of the Champions Hockey League in 2013). =Renaming= On 17 June 2013, the league was renamed \\"Svenska hockeyligan\\", since this would allow for an easy English translation (\\"Swedish Hockey League\\") and a common abbreviation between the two languages (\\"SHL\\"), all of which was considered to be a better brand identity to invest in.Aftonbladet: Bekr√§ftat: Elitserien byter namn. 17 June 2013.Skellefte√• AIK: Elitserien och Svenska Hockeyligan blir SHL. 17 June 2013. Game right Each regular season SHL game is composed of three 20-minute periods, with an intermission of a maximum of 18 minutes between periods. If the game is tied following the 60-minute regulation time, a five- minute three-on-three sudden death overtime period is played. If a game still is tied after the overtime period, a shootout decides the game. In a shootout, the team that scores the most penalty shots out of three attempts wins the game. If the game is still tied after the first three penalty-shot rounds, the shootout continues round by round, until one team scores while the other team fails to score. =Playoff games= In the event of a tied game during the playoffs, additional 20-minute overtime periods are played perpetually until one team scores. Unlike in the regular season, playoff overtime periods are played five-on-five. Only one game in Sweden has ever surpassed four full overtime periods, and no SHL games have surpassed three full overtime periods. The longest SHL game was the first game of the 1997 Swedish Championship semifinals, played on 23 March 1997 between Leksands IF and F√§rjestad BK. 6,012 spectators saw Andreas Karlsson score the game-winning goal for Leksand after 59 minutes of overtime (almost three full overtime periods). See Longest ice hockey games in Sweden for other games. SHL games are played on an ice hockey rink, which is rectangular ice rink with rounded corners and surrounded by a wall. It measures 30 by 60 meters (98.42 by 196.85 ft), conforming to international standards. Teams Head coaches of all twelve SHL teams, photographed in September 2011. Counting from the formation of the SHL in 1975, F√§rjestad BK is the most successful team with nine Swedish Championship titles. Bryn√§s IF and Djurg√•rdens IF are tied for the second most successful team with six championship titles. Counting from 1922, when the first Swedish championships were played, Djurg√•rdens IF is the most successful team with sixteen championship titles, followed by Bryn√§s IF with thirteen, as well as F√§rjestad BK and IK G√∂ta with nine. =2020‚Äì21 season= Season structure The SHL season is divided into a regular season from late September through the beginning of March, when teams play against each other in a pre-defined schedule, and a playoffs from March to April, which is an elimination tournament where two teams play against each other to win a best-of-seven series in order to advance to the next round. The final remaining team is crowned the Swedish champion, or Svenska m√§stare in Swedish, and receives the Le Mat Trophy. =Regular season= The regular season is a round-robin, where each team plays 52 games. Points are awarded for each game, where three points are awarded for winning in regulation time, two points for winning in overtime or shootout, one point for losing in overtime or shootout, and zero points for losing in regulation time. At the end of the regular season, the team that finishes with the most points is crowned the league champion and is awarded a prize sum of 1,000,000 SEK (approx. US$150,000) as a bonus. The six highest- ranked teams by points qualify directly for the playoffs. The four teams ranked 7‚Äì10 play a best-of-three series and battle for the two remaining playoff spots. The two lowest-ranked teams after the regular season have to play in the relegation and promotion series Kvalserien in order to qualify for the next season of the SHL. Before the 2013‚Äì14 season, the eight highest- ranked teams qualified for the playoffs. If two or more teams end up tied in points, the seeds are determined by the following tiebreaker format: #Best goal difference #Most goals scored #Head-to-head results between the tied teams =Playoffs= The SHL playoffs are an elimination tournament consisting of multi-game series where two teams battle to win a best-of-three or best-of- seven series in order to advance to the next round. The playoffs consist of four rounds: The eighth finals, the quarterfinals, the semifinals and the finals. In the first round, the eighth finals (known as Play In before the 2015‚Äì16 season), the 7th-ranked team from the regular season is paired against the 10th-ranked team and the 8th-ranked team is paired against the 9th-ranked teamen. In the quarterfinals, the six best teams from the regular season and the two winners of the eighth finals are paired seed-wise against each other, with the highest seed playing the lowest-remaining seed. In the semifinals, the teams are re-seeded, with the top remaining seed playing against the lowest remaining seed, and the other two remaining teams pairing off. In the finals, the two remaining teams face each other to determine the Swedish ice hockey champions. Before the 2013‚Äì14 season, the top-tier teams got to choose their opponents in the quarterfinals. The eighth finals are played as best-of- three series while the other rounds are played as best-of-seven series. In each series, the higher-ranked team of the two has home-ice advantage. Each series is played in an alternating home-away format, with the first game played at the higher seed's home venue. Any given series ends when one team has won more than half the maximum number of games needed to decide the series. =Relegation= The two lowest ranked teams after the regular season have to play in a relegation series called Kvalserien together with four teams from the second tier league HockeyAllsvenskan. The top two teams of Kvalserien qualify for the next SHL season, while the other four are demoted to HockeyAllsvenskan. Outdoor games Between 2009 and 2013, the league hosted an outdoor game in the regular season in December every year. The first outdoor game was played on 28 December 2009, between Fr√∂lunda HC and F√§rjestad BK at Ullevi. Fr√∂lunda came out on top with a 4‚Äì1 victory. 31,144 spectators saw the game, setting a new record for the largest attendance at an ice hockey league match in Sweden. The following year, F√§rjestad and Fr√∂lunda met again in an outdoor game, this time in Karlstad. F√§rjestad won the game 5‚Äì2 in front of 15,274 spectators. The 2013 outdoor game was played on 14 December 2013, between Fr√∂lunda HC and Skellefte√• AIK at Gamla Ullevi. The game was promoted as \\"Julmatchen\\" (English: The Christmas game) and was won by Skellefte√• 4‚Äì1 in front of 13,452 spectators. Notable players Three players in SHL history have been awarded the Golden Puck, as ice hockey player of the year in Sweden, more than once; Anders Andersson, Leif Holmqvist and Peter Forsberg have all won it twice. The top five career scorers in the SHL are Fredrik Bremberg (581 points), Johan Davidsson (561), J√∂rgen J√∂nsson (535), Jan Larsson (527) and Anders Carlsson (526). The top three career goal scorers are Lars-Gunnar Pettersson (271 goals), Magnus Wernblom (266) and H√•kan Loob (263). Jan Sandstr√∂m, David Petrasek and Per-√Öge Skr√∏der are the leaders in the number of SHL regular season games played, with Sandstr√∂m having played 952 games, Petrasek 887 and Skr√∏der 856.All-time player statistics at Eliteprospects.com. Retrieved 2014-06-13. The top three point-scoring forwards for the 2018‚Äì19 season were Ryan Lasch (50 points), Joakim Lindstr√∂m and Derek Roy (both with 42 points). Emil Bemstr√∂m was the top goal-scorer and thus the H√•kan Loob Trophy winner, with 23 goals. The top three point-scorers on defence were Jesse Virtanen (41 points), Ryan Gunderson (38) and Kodie Curran (37). The top three goaltenders by save percentage among those who played more than 40% of their team's minutes were Joel Lassinantti (.931), Adam Reideborn (.929) and Adam Werner (.926). Trophies and awards The winning team of the SHL playoffs is named Swedish Champions and awarded the Le Mat Trophy. There is only one trophy that is awarded to players based on their statistics during the regular season; the H√•kan Loob Trophy for the goal-scoring leader. One of the most prestigious individual awards is Guldhj√§lmen, which is awarded annually to the Most Valuable Player. The voting is conducted by the players in the SHL. Guldpucken is awarded annually to the ice hockey player of the year in Sweden. It is not necessarily awarded to a player in the SHL; for the 2005‚Äì06 season the award was given to Kenny J√∂nsson in the Swedish second-tier ice hockey league HockeyAllsvenskan. The award √Örets Rookie (Rookie of the Year) is awarded annually by Svenska Spel and Svenska Hockeyligan to the best rookie player in the SHL. Starting in 2010, an annual playoff MVP was acknowledged. The playoff MVP award was later renamed the Stefan Liv Memorial Trophy in honour of Swedish goalkeeper Stefan Liv after his death in the 2011 Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash.

On May 5, 1809, her patent for a new technique of weaving straw with silk and thread to make hats was signed by President James Madison. She was the first woman to receive a US Patent. Biography =Family life= Mary's father, John Dixon, was a farmer born in 1679 in Ulster, Ireland. Her mother, Janet Kennedy, was John Dixon's third wife. They had married in Voluntown, Connecticut on August 7, 1741. Mary Dixon was born in Killingly, Connecticut on March 21, 1752. She married Isaac Pike I, and in 1770 they had a son, Isaac Pike II. After his death she married John Kies (1750‚Äì1813) who died on August 18, 1813 at age 63. She then lived with her second son, Daniel Kies, in Brooklyn, New York, until her death at age 85 in 1837. =Career= Because of the Napoleonic Wars, the United States had embargoed all trade with France and Great Britain, creating a need for American-made hats to replace European millinery. The straw-weaving industry filled the gap, with over $500,000 ($9 million in today's money) worth of straw bonnets produced in Massachusetts alone in 1810. Mary Kies was not the first American woman to innovate in hat- making. In 1798, New Englander Betsy Metcalf invented a method of braiding straw. Her method became very popular, and she employed many women and girls to make her hats. The method created a new industry for girls and women because the straw bonnets could be made at home from local resources, so the women and girls could do work for themselves. Thus, Betsy Metcalf started the American straw-hat industry. Under the Patent Act of 1790 she could have sought a patent, but like most women at the time, who could not legally hold property, she chose not to. Mary Kies, however, broke that pattern on May 5, 1809. Dolley Madison was so pleased by Kies' innovation that she sent a personal letter applauding her. Kies' technique proved valuable in making cost-effective work bonnets. In so doing, she bolstered New England's hat economy, which had been faltering due to the Embargo Act of 1807. However, a change in the fashion of the day made her unable to profit from her invention and she died penniless in 1837. Her original patent file was destroyed in an 1836 fire at the United States Patent Office. =Legacy= In 2006, she was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

The small plant in front is about 1 cm tall. The concept of \\"individual\\" is stretched by this process. Bryophyllum daigremontianum produces plantlets along the margins of its leaves. When they are mature enough, they drop off and root in any suitable soil beneath. Vegetative reproduction from a stem cutting less than a week old. Some species are more conducive to this means of propagation than others. A bulb of Muscari has reproduced vegetatively underground to make two bulbs, each of which produces a flower stem. Vegetative reproduction (also known as vegetative propagation, vegetative multiplication or cloning) is any form of asexual reproduction occurring in plants in which a new plant grows from a fragment of the parent plant or a specialized reproductive structure. Many plants naturally reproduce this way, but it can also be induced artificially. Horticulturalists have developed asexual propagation techniques that use vegetative plant parts to replicate plants. Success rates and difficulty of propagation vary greatly. Monocotyledons typically lack a vascular cambium and therefore are harder to propagate.  Background  Plant propagation is the process of plant reproduction of a species or cultivar, and it can be sexual or asexual. It can happen through the use of vegetative parts of the plants, such as leaves, stems, and roots to produce new plants or through growth from specialized vegetative plant parts. While many plants reproduce by vegetative reproduction, they rarely exclusively use that method to reproduce. Vegetative reproduction is not evolutionary advantageous; it does not allow for genetic diversity and could lead plants to accumulate deleterious mutations. Vegetative reproduction is favored when it allows plants to produce more offspring per unit of resource than reproduction through seed production. In general, juveniles of a plant are easier to propagate vegetatively. Although most plants normally reproduce sexually, many can reproduce vegetatively, or can be induced to do so via hormonal treatments. This is because meristematic cells capable of cellular differentiation are present in many plant tissues. Vegetative propagation is usually considered a cloning method. However, root cuttings of thornless blackberries (Rubus fruticosus) will revert to thorny type because the adventitious shoot develops from a cell that is genetically thorny. Thornless blackberry is a chimera, with the epidermal layers genetically thornless but the tissue beneath it genetically thorny.. Grafting is often not a complete cloning method because seedlings are used as rootstocks. In that case, only the top of the plant is clonal. In some crops, particularly apples, the rootstocks are vegetatively propagated so the entire graft can be clonal if the scion and rootstock are both clones. Apomixis (including apospory and diplospory) is a type of reproduction that does not involve fertilization. In flowering plants, unfertilized seeds are produced, or plantlets that grow instead of flowers. Hawkweed (Hieracium), dandelion (Taraxacum), some citrus (Citrus) and many grasses such as Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) all use this form of asexual reproduction. Bulbils are sometimes formed instead of the flowers of garlic.  Mechanisms  Meristem tissue makes the process of asexual reproduction possible. It is normally found in stems, leaves, and tips of stems and roots and consists of undifferentiated cells that are constantly dividing allowing for plant growth and give rise to plant tissue systems. The meristem tissue's ability to continuously divide allows for vegetative propagation to occur. Another important ability that allows for vegetative propagation is the ability to develop adventitious roots which arise from other vegetative parts of the plants such as the stem or leaves. These roots allow for the development of new plants from body parts from other plants.  Advantages and disadvantages  = Advantages = There are several advantages of vegetative reproduction, mainly that the produced offspring are clones of their parent plants. If a plant has favorable traits, it can continue to pass down its advantageous genetic information to its offspring. It can be economically beneficial for commercial growers to clone a certain plant to ensure consistency throughout their crops. Vegetative propagation also allows plants to avoid the costly and complex process of producing sexual reproduction organs such as flowers and the subsequent seeds and fruits. For example, developing an ace cultivar is extremely difficult, so, once farmers develop the desired traits in lily, they use grafting and budding to ensure the consistency of the new cultivar and its successful production on a commercial level. However, as can be seen in many variegated plants, this does not always apply, because many plants actually are chimeras and cuttings might reflect the attributes of only one or some of the parent cell lines. Vegetative propagation also allows plants to circumvent the immature seedling phase and reach the mature phase faster. In nature, that increases the chances for a plant to successfully reach maturity, and, commercially, it saves farmers a lot of time and money as it allows for faster crop overturn. Vegetative reproduction offers research advantages in several areas of biology and has practical usage when it comes to afforestation. The most common use made of vegetative propagation by forest geneticists and tree breeders has been to move genes from selected trees to some convenient location, usually designated a gene bank, clone bank, clone-holding orchard, or seed orchard where their genes can be recombined in pedigreed offspring. = Disadvantage = A major disadvantage of vegetative propagation is that it prevents species genetic diversity which can lead to reductions in crop yields. The plants are genetically identical and are all, therefore, susceptible to pathogenic plant viruses, bacteria and fungi that can wipe out entire crops.  Types  = Natural means = Natural vegetative propagation is mostly a process found in herbaceous and woody perennial plants, and typically involves structural modifications of the stem, although any horizontal, underground part of a plant (whether stem, leaf, or root) can contribute to vegetative reproduction of a plant. Most plant species that survive and significantly expand by vegetative reproduction would be perennial almost by definition, since specialized organs of vegetative reproduction, like seeds of annuals, serve to survive seasonally harsh conditions. A plant that persists in a location through vegetative reproduction of individuals over a long period of time constitutes a clonal colony. In a sense, this process is not one of reproduction but one of survival and expansion of biomass of the individual. When an individual organism increases in size via cell multiplication and remains intact, the process is called \\"vegetative growth\\". However, in vegetative reproduction, the new plants that result are new individuals in almost every respect except genetic. Of considerable interest is how this process appears to reset the aging clock.(General J. Grant (1864). \\"Vegetative Reproduction in New York: a comprehensive study. Stony Brook University Press: NY, NY. As aforementioned, plants vegetetatively propagate both artificially and naturally. Most common methods of natural vegetative reproduction involves the development of a new plant from specialized structures of a mature plant. In addition to adventitious roots, roots that arise from plant structures other than the root, such as stems or leaves, modified stems, leaves and roots play an important role in plants' ability to naturally propagate. The most common modified stems, leaves and roots that allow for vegetative propagation are:  Runners  Also known as stolons, runners are modified stems that, unlike rhizomes, grow from existing stems just below the soil surface. As they are propagated, the buds on the modified stems produce roots and stems. Those buds are more separated than the ones found on the rhizome. Examples of plants that use runners are strawberries and currants.  Bulbs  Bulbs are inflated parts of the stem within which lie the central shoots of new plants. They are typically underground and are surrounded by plump and layered leaves that provide nutrients to the new plant. Examples of plants that use bulbs are shallots, lilies and tulips.  Tubers  Tubers develop from either the stem or the root. Stem tubers grow from rhizomes or runners that swell from storing nutrients while root tubers propagate from roots that are modified to store nutrients and get too large and produce a new plant. Examples of stem tubers are potatoes and yams and examples of root tubers are sweet potatoes and dahlias.  Corms  Corms are solid enlarged underground stems that store nutrients in their fleshy and solid stem tissue and are surrounded by papery leaves. Corms differ from bulbs in that their centers consists of solid tissue while bulbs consist of layered leaves. Examples of plants that use corms are gladiolus and taro.  Suckers  Also known as root sprouts, suckers are plant stems that arise from buds on the base of parent plants stems or on roots. Examples of plants that use suckers are apple, elm, and banana trees.  Plantlets  Plantlets are miniature structures that arise from meristem in leaf margins that eventually develops roots and drop from the leaves they grew on. An example of a plant that uses plantlets is the Bryophyllum daigremontianum (syn. Kalanchoe daigremontianum), which is also known as mother of thousands for its many plantlets.  Keikis  Keikis are additional offshoots which develop on vegetative stems or flower stalks of several orchids genera. Examples of plants that use keikis are the Phalaenopsis, Epidendrum, and Dendrobium genera of orchids. = Apomixis = Apomixis is the process of asexual reproduction through seed, in the absence of meiosis and fertilization, generating clonal progeny of maternal origin. = Artificial means = Vegetative propagation of particular cultivars that have desirable characteristics is very common practice. It is used by farmers and horticulturalists to produce better crops with desirable qualities. The most common methods of artificial vegetative propagation are:  Cutting  A cutting is a part of the plant, usually a stem or a leaf, is cut off and planted. Adventitious roots grow from cuttings and a new plant eventually develops. Usually those cuttings are treated with hormones before being planted to induce growth. Example: rose;hibiscus.  Grafting  Grafting involves attaching a scion, or a desired cutting, to the stem of another plant called stock that remains rooted in the ground. Eventually both tissue systems become grafted or integrated and a plant with the characteristics of the grafted plant develops, e.g. mango, guava, etc.  Layering  Layering is a process which includes the bending of plant branches or stems so that they touch the ground and are covered with soil. Adventitious roots develops from the underground part of the plant, which is known as the layer. This method of vegetative reproduction also occurs naturally. Another similar method, air layering, involved the scraping and replanting of tree branches which develop into trees.  Suckering  Suckers grow and form a dense compact mat that is attached to the parent plant. Too many suckers can lead to smaller crop size, so excess suckers are pruned, and mature suckers are transplanted to a new area where they develop into new plants.  Tissue culture  In tissue culture, plant cells are taken from various parts of the plant and are cultured and nurtured in a sterilized medium. The mass of developed tissue, known as the callus, is then cultured in a hormone-ladened medium and eventually develops into plantlets which are then planted and eventually develop into grown plants.  Offset  An offset is the lower part of a single culm with the rhizome axis basal to it and its roots. Planting of these is the most conventional way of propagating bamboo.

A road numbered by a state or province falls below numbered national highways (Canada being a notable exception to this rule) in the hierarchy (route numbers are used to aid navigation, and may or may not indicate ownership or maintenance). Roads maintained by a state or province include both nationally numbered highways and un-numbered state highways. Depending on the state, \\"state highway\\" may be used for one meaning and \\"state road\\" or \\"state route\\" for the other. In some countries such as New Zealand, the word \\"state\\" is used in its sense of a sovereign state or country. By this meaning a state highway is a road maintained and numbered by the national government rather than local authorities. Countries =Australia= Australian State Route 3 marker Australia's State Route system covers urban and inter-regional routes that are not included in the National Route or the National Highway systems. These routes are marked with a blue shield. Sometimes a state route may be formed when a former national route is decommissioned. Most states and territories have introduced an alphanumeric route numbering system, either completely or partially replacing the previous systems. =Brazil= SP-270 state highway shield in the state of S√£o Paulo Brazil is another country that is divided into states and has state highways. =Canada= An Ontario provincial highway marker A Canadian provincial highway double-signed with a numberless, but named, national Trans-Canada marker Canada is divided into provinces and territories, each of which maintains its own system of provincial or territorial highways, which form the majority of the country's highway network. There is also the national transcontinental Trans-Canada Highway system, which is marked by distinct signs, but has no uniform numeric designation across the country. In the eastern provinces, for instance, an unnumbered (though sometimes with a named route branch) Trans-Canada route marker is co-signed with a numbered provincial sign, with the provincial route often continuing alone outside the Trans-Canada Highway section. However, in the western provinces, the two parallel Trans-Canada routes are consistently numbered with Trans-Canada route markers; as Highways 1 and 16 respectively. Canada also has a designated National Highway System, but the system is completely unsigned, aside from the Trans-Canada routes. This makes Canada unique in that national highway designations are generally secondary to subnational routes. =Germany= Sign of the S258 state road () in Saxony In Germany, state roads () are a road class which is ranking below the federal road network (). The responsibility for road planning, construction and maintenance is vested in the federal states of Germany. Most federal states use the term (marked with 'L'), while for historical reasons Saxony and Bavaria use the term (marked with 'S'). The appearance of the shields differs from state to state. The term should not be confused with , which describes every road outside built-up areas and is not a road class. =Italy= Italy's Strade Statali extend for some 18,000 km, overseen by the Azienda Nazionale Autonoma delle Strade (ANAS) founded in 1946, replacing the A.A.S.S. (Azienda Autonoma delle Strade Statali) of 1928. =India= Road marker for state highways in India State highways in India are numbered highways that are laid and maintained by state governments. =Mexico= Mexico's State Highway System is a system of urban and state routes constructed and maintained by each Mexican state. The main purpose of the state networks is to serve as a feeder system to the federal highway system. All states except the Federal District operate a road network. Each state marks these routes with a white shield containing the abbreviated name of the state plus the route number. =New Zealand= New Zealand state highway marker New Zealand state highways are national highways ‚Äì the word \\"state\\" in this sense means \\"government\\" or \\"public\\" (as in state housing and state schools), not a division of a country. New Zealand's state highway system is a nationwide network of roads covering the North Island and the South Island. As of 2006, just under 100 roads have a \\"State Highway\\" designation. The NZ Transport Agency administers them. The speed limit for most state highways is 100 km/h, with reductions when one passes through a densely populated area. The highways in New Zealand were originally designated on a two-tier system, national (SH 1‚Äì8) and provincial, with national highways having a higher standard and funding priorities. Now all of them are state highways, and the network consists of SH 1 running the length of both main islands, SH 2‚Äì5 and 10‚Äì58 in the North Island, and SH 6‚Äì8 and 60‚Äì99 in the South Island. National and provincial highways are numbered approximately north to south. State Highway 1 runs the length of both islands. =South Korea= Local highways () are the next important roads under the National highways. The number has two, three, or four dights. Highways with two-digit numbers routes are called State-funded local highways. =United States= Default U.S. state highway marker State highways are generally a mixture of primary and secondary roads, although some are freeways (for example, State Route 99 in California, which links many of the cities of the Central Valley, Route 128 in Massachusetts, Ronald Reagan Cross County Highway (State Route 126) in Cincinnati, or parts of Route 101 in New Hampshire). Each state has its own system for numbering and its own marker. The default marker is a white circle containing a black sans serif number (often inscribed in a black square or slightly rounded square), according to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). However each state is free to choose a different marker, and most states have. States may choose a design theme relevant to its state to distinguish state route markers from interstate, county, or municipal route markers.

The Southwest Trail was a 19th-century pioneer route that was the primary passageway for American settlers bound for Texas. History The Southwest Trail, also known as the Old Military Road, replaced the older Natchitoches Trace, which ran from the mouth of the Missouri River, near present-day St. Louis, Missouri to present-day Fulton, Arkansas on the Red River. From Fulton, another American Indian trace followed the Red River to Natchitoches, Louisiana. Southwest Trail was a general term for a network of trails linking St. Louis and Ste- Genevi√®ve, Missouri to the Red River Valley of Texas. European American pioneers improved and expanded the older route. At the time of Americans' first settling the Texas territory, the Red River was the border between Mexico and the United States. Little more than a footpath before Arkansas became a territory in 1819, Southwest Trail became a major immigration route in the 1820s. By the 1830s more than 80 percent of the Arkansas territory's population had entered through the Southwest Trail. The U.S. Army improved the military road during Andrew Jackson‚Äôs presidency. Usage of the trail north of the Arkansas River declined in the late 1800s, but the trail south of the river remained in use decades longer. Route From the St. Louis and Ste- Genevi√®ve areas, the trail passed through Wayne County, Missouri. The Indian trace was the southern route of two followed by Cherokees and their enslaved Africans during the Trail of Tears. From its origin as a footpath, to a series of rugged roads, highways follow much of the route today. Southwest Trail enters Arkansas on Arkansas Highway 166, north of Maynard, (Randolph County). It then passes through communities of Attica, Pocahontas, Imboden, Smithville, Jesup, Strawberry and Walnut Grove. Two routes were used by pioneers en route to Southside. The older, eastern trail passes through Davidsonville, Newark and Oil Trough. Davidsonville was a pioneer key town on the Black River, but frequent flooding led to use of a newer, western route that passes through Sulphur Rock and crosses the White River at Batesville. From Southside, the trail follows U.S. Route 167 to Pleasant Plains, then Arkansas Highway 157 to Sunnydale, then Arkansas Highway 124 to Arkansas Highway 305 to Arkansas Highway 16 to Letona Road to Mount Pisgah Road to Morris School Road to Arkansas Highway 36 to Center Hill, then Arkansas Highway 305 to Floyd, then El Paso Road to Arkansas Highway 5 through El Paso to Arkansas Highway 89, then Tate's Mill Road to Batesville Pike Road through Gibson to Remount Road to Arkansas Highway 176 to Arkansas Highway 365 through North Little Rock. Southwest Trail crosses the Arkansas River on U.S. Route 70, through Little Rock to Arkansas Highway 5 through Bryant and Benton to U.S. Route 70, then Arkansas Highway 229 to U.S. Route 67. At Fairplay it takes Old Military Road to Rockport, where pioneers forded the Ouachita River. From Rockport it takes Arkansas Highway 84 to Social Hill, then Old Military Road to U.S. Route 67 at Midway, to Caddo Valley, then crosses the Caddo River on Arkansas Highway 7 to Old Military Road, to Arkansas Highway 8 then Mount Olive Road to Hollywood, then Arkansas Highway 26 to Antoine, then Arkansas Highway 29 to Arkansas Highway 19, returns to Arkansas Highway 29 through Blevins, to Arkansas Highway 32, then U.S. Route 278 to Washington. It then follows Arkansas Highway 195 to Fulton, and crosses the Red River on U.S. Route 67. It continues to Mandeville, turns off on Rondo Road to Rondo, then takes U.S. Route 82 west to the current Arkansas-Texas border of Texarkana. The trail is commemorated in the Historic Washington State Park, northwest of Hope. Washington was a key trading point near the southwest end of the trail.

He played as a centre in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Atlanta Thrashers. Following a single-vehicle accident in which he was a passenger, Snyder was injured and fell into a coma as a result. He died six days later of septic shock. Although he played in only forty-nine NHL games, the Thrashers named an annual award after him. The Dan Snyder Memorial Award is given each year to the player who \\"best embodies perseverance, dedication, and hard work without reward or recognition, so that his team and teammates might succeed.\\" After the Thrashers relocated to Winnipeg the Jets continued to present the award. The American Hockey League's (AHL) Chicago Wolves also have a yearly award given in his honor, the Dan Snyder Man of the Year Award, and have honored him by hanging a banner with other retired numbers and honored personnel. Likewise the Ontario Hockey League renamed their Humanitarian of the Year trophy in his honor as the Dan Snyder Memorial Trophy. Playing career The Chicago Wolves banner honoring Snyder =Junior= In 1994 Snyder was one of the last players selected for his hometown Junior B team, the Elmira Sugar Kings. He struggled early in the season and was warned that if his poor play continued he might be replaced. Snyder's play improved following the talk, eventually earning the Sugar Kings rookie of the year honors.Manasso p. 23 The following year he tried out for the Owen Sound Platers, a Major junior team playing in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL).Manasso p. 18 After starting his try-out slowly, the coaching staff gave him the option to stop and pursue an NCAA scholarship. Snyder decided to continue his try-out and made the team after leading the Platers in scoring during the exhibition season.Manasso p. 24 He played four years for the Platers registering 75 goals and 221 points, captaining the team in his final two seasons. =Professional= Undrafted, Snyder was signed by the Thrashers as a free agent in 1999. During his time in the minor leagues, he was a member of the International Hockey League champion Orlando Solar Bears in 2000‚Äì2001, and the American Hockey League champion Chicago Wolves In 2001‚Äì2002, he was called up to the NHL, he scored 10 goals and four assists in 36 games with the Thrashers in the 2002‚Äì2003 season. Death and legacy On September 29, 2003, Snyder was critically injured after the Ferrari 360 Modena, being driven by his friend and teammate Dany Heatley, crashed. Heatley, who was driving between 55 and 82 MPH in a 35 MPH zone, lost control and skidded into a brick pillar and iron fence. Both players were ejected from the car, which was split in half by the force of the impact. Snyder required surgery to repair a depressed skull fracture and was comatose. Six days later on October 5, he lapsed into septic shock and died, never regaining consciousness. Heatley was charged with vehicular homicide as a result of the crash, a sentence that could have carried as much as 15 years in prison. He pleaded guilty to second-degree vehicular homicide, driving too fast for conditions, failure to maintain a lane, and speeding. He was sentenced to three years' probation and ordered to give 150 speeches on the dangers of speeding, and pay $25,000 to Fulton County for the cost of investigating the crash. The lighter sentence was due in part to Snyder's parents forgiving Heatley for the accident, their desire that he not be sent to prison, and the judge's opinion that Heatley being in prison would not benefit the community. A replica of the patch the Thrashers wore in memory of Dan Snyder The following season, Atlanta dedicated the season to Snyder and Heatley, while further honoring Snyder with a patch displaying his number 37 on it and painting the same logo on the boards. Snyder was further honored with the creation of The Dan Snyder Memorial Scholarship. The scholarships were to be given to three recipients from the Elmira area. On December 31, 2003, the Thrashers played the Detroit Red Wings; during the game both teams wore the commemorative patch. Following the game the NHLPA auctioned off the game-worn jerseys with the proceeds going towards the scholarships; the resulting auction raised $56,029. The Chicago Wolves paid tribute to Snyder by renaming their community service award the Dan Snyder Man of the Year Award, while the OHL renamed their Humanitarian of the Year trophy in his honor, making it the Dan Snyder Memorial Trophy. During the 2006‚Äì07 NHL season, Snyder's parents, Graham and LuAnn Snyder, traveled across North America in an RV attending NHL games and speaking at engagements to raise awareness for the Dan Snyder Memorial Foundation, a foundation that provides four college scholarships a year and helps raise money for the Elmira recreation center. Canadian band The Tragically Hip recorded a song called \\"Heaven Is a Better Place Today\\" in honor of Snyder. The song appears on their In Between Evolution album. In 2003, plans for a new sports complex in Elmira were completed with a projected completion date in 2017. Snyder felt that the project needed to be completed much quicker and wanted to help make it happen sooner. After his death the Dan Snyder Memorial Foundation contributed $750,000 to the project which opened in 2009. The main arena houses the Sugar Kings and was named the Dan Snyder Memorial Arena. The Atlanta Thrashers held a practice and promotional session in the arena on October 18, 2009.

This definition describes Old Regular Baptists, not those who formed as a result of the Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy. The most prominent Regular Baptist group is the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches. While the term Regular Baptist was originally a reference to the Particular Baptists, it came to be used more loosely as a synonym for orthodox. The Baptist Bulletin of the GARBC defines them simply as groups who believe \\"orthodox, Baptist doctrine\\" and \\"affirm the rule or measure of the Scripture.\\" As compared to General Baptists or Free Baptists, Regular Baptists were strict in their beliefs, and therefore also called Strict or Hard-shell Baptists. To be a Regular Baptist church in the GARBC is to hold to distinctive baptistic ecclesiology and interpret the Bible literally. History =United States= The term Regular Baptists developed in America from English immigrants who had been influenced by the Particular and General Baptists churches that were established in England. According to Stuart Ivison and Fred Rosser: \\"By 1638 there were also congregations of ‚ÄòParticular‚Äô Baptists, who held that the Atonement was of particular application, i.e., for the sake of the elect only.\\" The General, also known as Free Baptists, however, believed that all people could reap the benefits of atonement. This meant, particularly for the western pioneers, that individuals that were baptized were allowed to become church members and take communion. The number of Regular Baptists began to increase over the number of General or Free Baptists after the 1707 formation of the Philadelphia Baptist Association (PBA), which in 1742 developed a Confession of Faith. The influence and mission program of the Philadelphia Baptists shifted many of the Free Baptists to Regular Baptists. John Asplund traveled the United States and created the first comprehensive list of Baptist denominations in the United States in 1790 entitled Annual Register of the Baptist Denomination in America. He found that the greatest number of Baptist churches at that time were Regular Baptist churches. In the 1800s, the term Regular Baptist came to describe the Free Baptists. This was a surprising change as the term regular initially described the opposing position to the Free Baptists (i.e., particular atonement). This happened as a result of the strict view of communion they took which held that individuals must be baptized prior to partaking of the Lord's Table. Between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Northern Baptist Convention was polluted by individuals who were adopting the higher-critical theories of German theologians. This caused many to separate from the convention and to form several groups of conservative, fundamental baptists. During this, the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches was born. Their designation as Regular Baptists was unrelated to the dispute over general and particular atonement. There are still a number of organizations that are considered Regular Baptists, but the degree of strictness regarding atonement beliefs may vary across Regular Baptists churches today. *Old Regular Baptists is a group formed in Kentucky in 1825 from the New Salem Association of United Baptists, which was formed in Kentucky in 1825. After several name changes, its name has been Old Regular since 1892. They practice foot washing and observe closed communion. * The Sovereign Grace Association of Old Regular Baptist Churches of Jesus Christ conducts many of the practices of the Old Regular Baptists, but consider themselves more conservative. * The General Association of Regular Baptist Churches ‚Äî organized in 1932 by conservative and fundamentalist churches withdrawing from the Northern Baptist Convention (now American Baptist Churches). Today, there are more than 1,200 churches in their association. Unlike other Regular Baptist groups, they are primarily in the North, they do not practice foot washing as an ordinance, and they take no position on calvinism. They manage and operate Regular Baptist Press, the publishing arm of their association. They are headquartered in Arlington Heights, Illinois. =Canada= The term Regular Baptists denotes churches with strict, orthodox Baptist beliefs. In 1928, the Union of Regular Baptist Churches was formed in Hamilton, Ontario. It was succeeded in 1957 by the Association of Regular Baptist Churches of Ontario, Canada, which continues to uphold closed communion teaching and practice. Related organizations *Union Baptists ‚Äî a strand of Regular Baptists that owes its origin to the Civil War. Churches and associations, especially in border states, were rent asunder by this national conflict. Tensions over secession, war and reconstruction, as well as the fact that Primitive Baptists did not allow members to hold membership in secret societies, combined to incubate the Union Baptists. Many pro-Union Primitive Baptists joined Union Leagues and were expelled from their churches and associations. The Mountain Union Association, formed in 1867, was the first \\"Union\\" Baptist Association. Unlike other areas, this distinction, at least in name, has persisted, and some churches and associations consider themselves \\"Union Baptists\\". There seems to be no doctrinal distinction between Union Baptists and Regular Baptists. Three associations ‚Äî Original Mountain Union, Primitive and Union ‚Äî have about 3300 members in 36 churches. Mitchell River Union Baptist Association may still be in existence. *Regular Baptists ‚Äî found in 5 local associations; much like the Old Regular Baptists, and located in the same region, but more open to changes in worship and lifestyle. Churches have allowed notated hymnals, Sunday Schools, revivals and even instrumental music. Three associations, mostly in North Carolina, are in correspondence ‚Äî Little River, Little Valley and Mountain Union (708 members in 15 churches in 1999). Two others are in isolated areas and not connected to the first three ‚Äî East Washington in Arkansas (1560 members in 10 churches in 1999) and Enterprise in Ohio, Kentucky and bordering areas (4288 members in 63 churches in 1999). *Fellowship of Evangelical Baptist Churches in Canada ‚Äî although the FEBCC is not generally considered Regular Baptist, some churches of this Fellowship still carry Regular Baptist as part of their name, especially in British Columbia. Three of four major bodies forming and entering the FEBCC from 1953 to 1965 were Regular Baptist. *Canadian Baptists of Ontario and Quebec (CBOQ) ‚Äî Many Baptist churches were once Regular Baptist Churches. The CBOQ exists to equip churches and leaders to engage with their mission from God in their community. Notable members * Thomas and Nancy Lincoln, President Abraham Lincoln's parents, were members of the Licking-Locust Association of Regular Baptists in Kentucky.

The term is usually used disapprovingly against more serious hard news.Merriam- Webster, The Cambridge Online DictionaryCambridge Online Dictionary Many existing, self-described infotainment websites and social media apps provide a variety of functions and services.\\"an extraordinary form of strategic internal communications\\" (infotainment.be) and historically accurate factoid collections (how- infotaining.com) Criticism The label \\"infotainment\\" is emblematic of concern and criticism that journalism is devolving from a medium which conveys serious information about issues affecting public interest, into a form of entertainment which happens to have fresh \\"facts\\" in the mix. The criteria by which reporters and editors judge news value‚Äîwhether something is worth putting on the front page, the bottom of the hour, or is worth commenting on at all‚Äîare integral parts of this debate. Some blame the media for this perceived phenomenon, for failing to live up to ideals of civic journalistic responsibility, while others blame the commercial nature of many media organizations, the need for higher ratings, combined with a preference among the public for feel-good content and \\"unimportant\\" topics such as celebrity gossip or sports. In a critique of infotainment, Bonnie Anderson of News Flash cited a CNN lead story on February 2, 2004 following the exposure of Janet Jackson's breast on national television. The follow-up story was about a ricin chemical attack on then-U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist.Anderson, Bonnie M., \\"News Flash\\", Wiley 2004, p. 1, p. 33. A specialization process has also occurred, beginning with the rise of mass market special-interest magazines, moving into broadcast with the advent of cable television, and continuing into new media such as the Internet and satellite radio. An increasing number of media outlets are available to the public which exclusively focus on single topics such as current events, home improvement, history, movies, women and Christianity. Consumers have a broad choice whether they receive a general feed of the most \\"important\\" information of the day or a highly customized presentation of a single type of content. Highly customized content streams may not be considered newsworthy nor contain a neutral point of view. Some publications and channels have found a sizable audience in the \\"niche\\" of featuring hard news. Controversy has continued over the size of the audience and whether outlets are diluting content with too much \\"soft\\" news. The distinction between journalists and anchors versus reporters are \\"human interest\\", personality, or celebrity news story pieces. Soft news reporters and stories are typically directed by marketing share departments based on a demographic appeal and audience share. It is commonly accepted news anchors are also media personalities which may also be considered celebrities. Media outlets commonly use on-air personalities for their public appeal to promote the network's investments similar to the regular broadcast schedule including self-promotion and advertising. Critics might go so far as to view anchors as a weak link, representing the misplacement of both the credit and the accountability of a news journalism organization--hence adding to a perceived erosion of journalistic standards throughout the news business. (See yellow journalism.) Most infotainment television programs on networks and broadcast cable only contain general information on the subjects they cover and should not be considered to be formal learning or instruction. An example of a broadcast may include accusations of a celebrity or other individual committing a crime with no verifiable factual support or evidence of such claims. It can be said that many viewers and social critics disapprove of how media, particularly TV and cable, seem to hurtle from one event to another, often dwelling on trivial, celebrity-driven content Campbell, R., Martin, R. C, and Fabos, B. G. Media & culture: An introduction to mass communication. Bedford/St.Martin‚Äôs, 2012 As seen with the commodification celebrities and public figures/leaders, news media is more frequently commodifying and selling the stories of people's lives for pure viewer reaction and entertainment as opposed to more focus being placed on real stories with informative meaning behind them. In October 2010 at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear, American political satirist Jon Stewart made a metaphorical statement regarding the media today: \\"The press can hold its magnifying glass up to our problems . . . illuminating issues heretofore unseen, or they can use that magnifying glass to light ants on fire and then perhaps host a week of shows on the sudden, unexpected, dangerous flaming ant epidemic.\\" This statement referred to the news media's ability to focus in on the real problems of people, and transform them into what is known as infotainment, when this information is solely provided for the public's entertainment. Today's broadcasting of informative news is often diluted with stories of scandal, although this is no concern for media and news broadcasters because if you can keep enough viewers week after week focused on whatever is that next \\"flaming ant epidemic\\" (e.g., a congressman's sexual indiscretions, conspiracy theories about the president's birth certificate and other examples related to politainment), you can boost audience ratings and sell ads at higher ratesCampbell, R., Martin, R. C, and Fabos, B. G. Media & culture: An introduction to mass communication. Bedford/St.Martin‚Äôs, 2012. = For women = Historically, the term infotainment was used to discredit woman journalists who were assigned soft news jobs. Soft news was expected to be consumed by only women, but eventually it became the norm of news media in general. Journalism Some define \\"journalism\\" only as reporting on \\"serious\\" subjects, where common journalistic standards are upheld by the reporter. Others believe that the larger \\"news business\\" encompasses everything from professional journalism to so-called \\"soft news\\" and \\"infotainment\\", and support activities such as marketing, advertising sales, finance and delivery. Nevertheless, a differentiation of the two concepts of \\"hard news\\" and \\"soft news\\" is controversial.Reinemann, C., Stanyer, J., Scherr, S., & Legnante, G. (2012). Hard and soft news: A review of concepts, operationalizations and key findings. Journalism, 13(2), 221-239. doi:10.1177/1464884911427803 Professional journalism is supposed to place more emphasis on research, fact- checking, and the public interest than its \\"non-journalistic\\" counterparts. Because the term \\"news\\" is quite broad, the terms \\"hard\\" and \\"soft\\" denote both a difference in respective standards for news value, as well as for standards of conduct, relative to the professional ideals of journalistic integrity. The idea of hard news embodies two orthogonal concepts: * Seriousness: Politics, economics, crime, war, and disasters are considered serious topics, as are certain aspects of law, business, science, and technology. * Timeliness: Stories that cover current events‚Äîthe progress of a war, the results of a vote, the breaking out of a fire, a significant statement, the freeing of a prisoner, an economic report of note. The logical opposite, soft news is sometimes referred to in a derogatory fashion as infotainment. Defining features catching the most criticism include: * The least serious subjects: Arts and entertainment, sports, lifestyles, \\"human interest\\", and celebrities. * Not timely: There is no precipitating event triggering the story, other than a reporter's curiosity. Timely events happen in less serious subjects‚Äîsporting matches, celebrity misadventures, movie releases, art exhibits, and so on. There may also be serious reports which are not event-driven‚Äîcoverage of important social, economic, legal, or technological trends‚Äî investigative reports which uncover ongoing corruption, pollution, or immorality‚Äî or discussion of unsettled political issues without any special reason. Anniversaries, holidays, the end of a year or season, or the end of the first 100 days of an administration, can make some stories time-sensitive, but provide more of an opportunity for reflection and analysis than any actual \\"news\\" to report. The spectrum of \\"seriousness\\" and \\"importance\\" is not well-defined, and different media organizations make different tradeoffs. \\"News you can use\\", a common marketing phrase highlighting a specific genre of journalism, spans the gray area. Gardening tips and hobby \\"news\\" pretty clearly fall at the entertainment end. Warnings about imminent natural disasters or acute domestic security threats (such as air raids or terrorist attacks) are considered so important that broadcast media (even non-news channels) usually interrupt other programming to announce them. A medical story about a new treatment for breast cancer, or a report about local ground water pollution might fall in between. So might book reviews, or coverage of religion. On the other hand, people frequently find hobbies and entertainment to be worthwhile parts of their lives and so \\"importance\\" on a personal level is rather subjective.  Entertainment and news crossovers  Infotainment is generally identified by its entertaining nature through the use of flashy graphics, fast-paced editing, music, and the use sensationalism or satire. Popular examples include Entertainment Tonight, Hannity and Colmes, The Daily Show, and shows that would not be classified as news earlier, such as The Oprah Winfrey Show. = Infotainers = Infotainers are entertainers in infotainment media, such as news anchors or satirists who cross the line between journalism (quasi-journalism) and entertainment. Barbara Walters, was for many an infotainer icon. She pioneered the many techniques used in the Infotainment media today. Other notable examples in the U.S. media are Jon Stewart, Bill O‚ÄôReilly, Rachel Maddow and Geraldo Rivera among others. When Geraldo Rivera became the host of his own news-oriented talk show on CNBC, others within the NBC organization voiced their protest, including Tom Brokaw who was reported to have threatened to quit. Rivera had a notorious history as a \\"sleaze reporter\\" and daytime talk show host, where he and one or two others were representative of \\"Tabloid talk shows\\"; television seen to have little social value or redeeming intelligence, but still popular with viewers. Commodification The broadcast of important or interesting events was originally meant simply to inform society of local or international events for their own safety and awareness. However, local news broadcasters are more regularly commodifying local events to provoke titillation and entertainment in viewers. Commodification is known as the process by which material objects are turned into marketable goods with monetary (exchange) value.Sturken & Cartwright, 1980: p. 435. Essential qualities of human beings and their products are converted into commodities, into things for buying and selling on the market,Taussig, T. M. The devil and commodity fetishism in South America. Chapel Hill (NC): America University of North Carolina Press, 1980. just as entertaining stories are sold to buy the attention of viewers. Commodity fetishism is the process through which commodities are emptied of the meaning of their production (the labour that produced them and the context in which they were produced) and filled instead with the abstract meaning (usually through advertising).Sturken, M., and L. Cartwright. Practices of looking: An introduction to visual culture. New York: Oxford University Press, Inc., 2009 At their worst, the media's appetite for telling and selling stories leads them not only to document tragedy, but also to misrepresent or exploit itCampbell, R., Martin, R. C, and Fabos, B. G. Media & culture: An introduction to mass communication. Bedford/St.Martin's, 2012. As often seen in the news (with stories of extreme obesity or unusual deformities) present- day \\"infotainment\\" commodifies humans through their personal tragedies or scandals, providing entertainment and titillation to public viewers. Social media implications The topic of news media today being more commonly considered ‚Äúinfotainment‚Äù has increased with the growing popularity and use of social media applications. These popular social media outlets are what German theorist J√ºrgen Habermas would define as the \\"public sphere\\". According to Habermas, it defines a social space (which may be virtual) in which citizens come together to debate and discuss the present issues of their society. The term has been used more recently in the plural to refer to the multiple public spheres in which people debate contemporary issues. In the case of social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook, which were originally created for the purpose of connecting, re-connecting and sharing personal thoughts and information with public, they have now provided a new medium for the spread of \\"infotainment\\" and exploitation of public matters. There is no doubt that these social media websites are dominating, and what is so pressing about the matter is the fact that alongside cell phone technology, these ways of online communication are becoming prominent to the simple relaying of informative news. Of necessity, a commodity-based society produces such phantom objectivity, and in so doing it obscures its roots.Taussig, T. M. The devil and commodity fetishism in South America. Chapel Hill (NC): America University of North Carolina Press, 1980 The public society are relying more frequently on television news broadcasting and now social media outlets to obtain a mixture of information and entertainment updates which are known as \\"infotainment.\\" Origin The terms \\"infotainment\\" and \\"infotainer\\" were first used in September 1980 at the Joint Conference of Aslib, the Institute of Information Scientists and the Library Association in Sheffield, UK. The Infotainers were a group of British information scientists who put on comedy shows at their professional conferences between 1980 and 1990. In 1983, infotainment began to see more popular usage Around this time, infotainment gradually began to replace soft news with communications theorists.

History  The impact of modernism on the Northern Baptist Convention (now called the American Baptist Churches in the USA) led to the eventual withdrawal of a number of conservative and fundamentalist churches. The Baptist Bible Union (BBU) of 1923 was the forerunner to the GARBC. The final meeting of the BBU in 1932 in Chicago was the first meeting of the GARBC.  Philosophy  The association endorses a fourfold mission: *Champion Biblical Truth *Impact the World for Christ *Perpetuate a Baptist Heritage *Advance the Association Churches  Organization  The GARBC follows a \\"fellowship\\" model rather than a denominational model. Each member church is free to act independently in all matters. The home office of the GARBC holds no controlling power over member churches. The purpose of the association is for fellowship between churches of like faith and practice. The association's home office is located at 3715 N. Ventura Dr., Arlington Heights, Illinois. On this site, Regular Baptist Press publishes church education curriculum and the association's bimonthly magazine, the Baptist Bulletin. Rev.

He gained national recognition as O. J. Simpson's friend and defense attorney during Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He had four children with his first wife, Kris Kardashian (n√©e Houghton, later Jenner): Kourtney, Kim, Khlo√©, and Rob, who appear on their family reality television series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and its spinoffs. Early life Kardashian was born in Los Angeles, California, on February 22, 1944, one of three children born to Arthur Kardashian (October 27, 1917 ‚Äì December 9, 2012) and Helen Jean Arakelian Kardashian (July 15, 1917 ‚Äì May 21, 2008), both Armenian Americans.\\"California Birth Index, 1905-1995,\\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VLGL-TX5 : 27 November 2014), Robert George Kardashian, 22 Feb 1944; citing Los Angeles, California, United States, Department of Health Services, Vital Statistics Department, Sacramento. He had a sister, Barbara Kardashian Freeman, and a brother, Thomas \\"Tom\\" Kardashian. The Kardashians were Armenian Spiritual Christians originally from Kars Oblast, and known by the surname Kardaschoff, a Russianized form of the Armenian surname Kardashian, as the area, though now part of modern-day Turkey, was then part of the Russian Empire. Once in the United States, Arthur's father, Tatos, changed his name to Thomas, and began a career in garbage collection, founding his own business, and married Hamas Shakarian, also an immigrant of Armenian heritage. He grew up in the affluent View Park area of Los Angeles County, where the family lived on 4908 Valley Ridge Avenue. Kardashian attended Susan Miller Dorsey High School and the University of Southern California, from which he graduated in 1966 with a B.S. degree in business administration.Beth Shuster, \\"Kardashian-Simpson Bond Stands Test of Time, Trouble\\", Los Angeles Times, July 6, 1994. He earned a J.D. degree from the University of San Diego School of Law and practiced for about a decade; after that, he went into business. In 1973, Kardashian was one of the co-founders of the trade publication Radio & Records, which he and his partners sold for a large profit in 1979. Kardashian also pioneered the idea of playing music between movies in theaters. He subsequently parlayed the concept into a business, starting a company called Movie Tunes. He served as President and CEO of the firm and later invested in Juice Inc., a frozen yogurt company, and in a music video business called Concert Cinema.  O. J. Simpson case  Kardashian and Simpson first met around 1967 while both of them were at USC and became close friends. Simpson was the best man at Robert Kardashian and Kris Houghton's wedding in 1978. Robert was the water boy for the USC Trojans football team which would be ranked #1 in the nation in the AP Poll. Following the June 12, 1994, murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, Simpson stayed in Kardashian's house to avoid the media. Kardashian was the man seen carrying Simpson's garment bag the day that Simpson flew back from Chicago. Prosecutors speculated that the bag may have contained Simpson's bloody clothes or the murder weapon. When Simpson failed to turn himself in at 11 a.m. on June 17, 1994, Kardashian read a letter by Simpson to the assembled media. This letter was interpreted by many as a suicide note. Simpson was charged with the murders and subsequently acquitted of all criminal charges in a controversial criminal trial. Kardashian had let his license to practice law become inactive before the Simpson case but reactivated it to aid in Simpson's defense as a volunteer assistant on his legal team, alongside Simpson's main defense attorneys, Robert Shapiro and Johnnie Cochran. As one of Simpson's lawyers and a member of the defense \\"Dream Team\\", Kardashian could not be compelled or subpoenaed to testify against Simpson in the case, which included Simpson's past history and behavior with his ex-wife Nicole, and as to the contents of Simpson's garment bag. He sat by Simpson throughout the trial. The New York Times reported that Kardashian said in a 1996 ABC interview with Barbara Walters that he had begun to question Simpson's innocence: \\"I have doubts. The blood evidence is the biggest thorn in my side; that causes me the greatest problems. So I struggle with the blood evidence.\\" Kardashian and Simpson ultimately stopped speaking to each other. Illness and death Kardashian was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in July 2003. He died two months later, on September 30, 2003, at age 59, and was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California. In popular culture Kardashian was portrayed by David Schwimmer in the 2016 FX miniseries American Crime Story: The People v. O. J. Simpson. Schwimmer was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his performance, but lost to Sterling K. Brown, who portrayed Christopher Darden in the same series. In 2016, ESPN Films and their 30 for 30 series produced a five-part miniseries called O.J.: Made in America, produced by Ezra Edelman, in which Kardashian was featured heavily through archive footage. In 2017, Kardashian was the subject of the pilot episode of the TV comedy series Over My Dead Body on Amazon Prime. Personal life Kardashian had four children with his first wife, Kris Kardashian (n√©e Houghton, subsequently Jenner): Kourtney, Kimberly, Khlo√©, and Rob. Shortly after separating from his first wife in 1991, Kardashian became engaged to Denice Shakarian Halicki, his third cousin and the widow of movie producer H.B. Halicki.Dominick Dunne, \\"Three Faces of Evil\\" Vanity Fair, June 1996.Mike Fleeman, \\"Stand By Your Man\\", Los Angeles, October 1996. The couple never married. In 1998, Kardashian married Jan Ashley; however, the marriage ended in annulment 30 days later. Ashley later claimed frequent upset and turmoil related to Kardashian's ex-wife Kris and their children \\"were instrumental\\" in the demise of the relationship. After dating for three years and proposing in 2001, Kardashian married his third wife, Ellen Pierson (n√©e Markowitz), six weeks prior to his death.

He was also a political scientist interested especially in the relationship of politics and the media. Early life Rosten was born into a Yiddish-speaking family in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Russian Empire (now in Poland), but emigrated to the United States with his family in 1911 when he was three. His parents were Samuel Rosten and Ida Freundlich Rosten, both trade unionists. They opened a knitting shop in the Greater Lawndale area of Chicago, where Rosten and his younger sister grew up among other working-class Jewish families. Like their neighbors, the children spoke both English and Yiddish. Rosten showed an interest in books and language very early and began writing stories when he was only nine. During the Great Depression, when he was unable to find other work, he taught English for recent immigrants at night. These experiences eventually became the source of his most popular works, The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N and The Return of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N. Rosten studied political science, economics, and psychology at both the University of Chicago, where he obtained his doctorate in political science, and the London School of Economics. From this time date his life-long friendships with Milton Friedman, W. Allen Wallis and other economists who would become influential in forming American neoliberalism. Like them, Rosten became a member of the Mont P√®lerin Society. Like other University of Chicago graduates, during the war he worked in Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, both as deputy director at the Office of War Information and as assistant to Lowell Mellett, one of Roosevelt's aids. After the war, his connection with Allen Wallis led to his involvement with forming the Social Sciences division at the RAND Corporation. Although Rosten, who was already involved in Hollywood at this point, did not work full-time at RAND, he was an influential consultant on human psychology and put RAND in contact with several influential academics such as Hans Speier and Bernard Brodie. He also suggested that RAND contact the Ford Foundation for funding.Alex Abella, Soldiers of Reason: The RAND Corporation and the Rise of the American Empire (Orlando: Harcourt, Inc., 2008), p. 24‚Äì27, 29. Scriptwriter Rosten was a successful screenwriter. He wrote the story for The Dark Corner (1946), a film noir starring Mark Stevens; and Lured, the Douglas Sirk-directed period drama starring Charles Coburn; both films featured Lucille Ball. He is listed as one of the writers for Captain Newman, M.D. (1963) adapted from his novel of the same title. Other films: Mechanized Patrolling (1943) (as Leonard Q. Ross), They Got Me Covered (1943) (story) (as Leonard Q. Ross), All Through the Night (1942) (story) (as Leonard Q. Ross), The Conspirators (1944) (screenplay), The Velvet Touch (1948), Sleep, My Love (1948) (novel) (screenplay), Double Dynamite (1954) (story), Walk East on Beacon (1952), and Mister Cory (1957) (story). Stories and books Rosten is best remembered for his stories about the night-school \\"prodigy\\" Hyman Kaplan, written under the pseudonym Leonard Q. Ross. They were published in The New Yorker from 1935 and collected in two volumes published in 1937 and 1959, The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N and The Return of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N. The Education was a \\"close second\\" for one U.S. National Book Award in 1938. Probably that award was the Most Original Book of 1937. See Hyman Kaplan for more information. The second collection was one of eighteen National Book Award for Fiction finalists in 1960. He is also well known for his encyclopedic The Joys of Yiddish (1968), a guide to Yiddish and to Jewish culture including anecdotes and Jewish humor. It was followed by O K*A*P*L*A*N! My K*A*P*L*A*N! (1976), a reworking of the two 1930s collections, and Hooray for Yiddish! (1982), a humorous lexicon of the American language as influenced by Jewish culture. Another Rosten work is Leo Rosten's Treasury of Jewish Quotations. Quotations Among his own many quotations are \\"A conservative is one who admires radicals centuries after they're dead,\\" \\"Truth is stranger than fiction; fiction has to make sense,\\"Rosten, Leo. \\"Truth is edifying, wholesome, and stranger than fiction. As Mark Twain said, 'Why shouldn't it be?' Life, unlike fiction, doesn't have to make either sense or point.\\" The Return of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N (preface). Victor Gollancz Ltd, London, 1959, p. 11. \\"We see things as we are, not as they are,\\" and \\"The purpose of life is not to be happy at all. It is to be useful, to be honorable. It is to be compassionate. It is to matter, to have it make some difference that you lived.\\"\\"The Myths by Which We Live\\", The Rotarian (Evanston, Illinois) volume 107, number 3 (September 1965) 32‚Äì33 etc, page 55. (A version of this quotation is sometimes attributed, falsely, to Ralph Waldo Emerson.) At a tribute dinner to fellow humorist W. C. Fields, Rosten came up with the remark about Fields that \\"any man who hates dogs and babies can't be all bad.\\"Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. A. Knopf, New York, 2003, p. 392. This statement is often misattributed to Fields himself.Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. A. Knopf, New York, 2003, p. 393. In his book, The Joys of Yiddish, he defines the word chutzpah as \\"that quality enshrined in a man who, having killed his mother and father, throws himself on the mercy of the court because he is an orphan.\\" In his novel Silky, he defines \\"nebbish\\" as \\"The kind of person, when he leaves a room, you have the feeling someone fascinating just walked in.\\" Personal life On March 30, 1935, Rosten married Priscilla Ann \\"Pam\\" Mead (1911‚Äì1959), a fellow graduate student at the University of Chicago and sister of anthropologist Margaret Mead. Rosten's marriage to Mead also made him a brother-in-law of William Steig and the uncle of Jeremy Steig and Mary Catherine Bateson. They had two daughters: Madeline Rosten and Margaret Ramsey Rosten; and a son, Philip Rosten (1938‚Äì1996), and six grandchildren: Josh and Ben Lee (Madeline), Seth Muir (Margaret), and Alexander, Carrie and Pamela Rosten (Phillip). Carrie followed in her grandfather's literary footsteps and has written three books, including a young adult novel, Chloe Leiberman (Sometimes Wong). Leo's and Pam's marriage ended in divorce in 1959; she took her own life on December 1 the same year.Jane Howard, Margaret Mead: A Life. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1984, page 359. Rosten's second wife, whom he married January 5, 1960, was Gertrude Zimmerman (1915‚Äì1995).[Obituary], The New York Times, February 20, 1997. Rosten died in New York City in 1997. His obituary in The Independent on February 21, 1997, written by Chaim Bermant, describes his personality as follows:[Obituary], Chaim Bermant, The Independent, February 21, 1997. > Rosten was an inveterate Anglophile.

He created special effects for Fritz Lang's 1929 Woman in the Moon, one of the first sci-fi rocket movies, and influenced Disney's Fantasia. He made over 50 short films and painted around 800 canvases, many of which are in museums, galleries, and collections worldwide. Among his film works is Motion Painting No. 1 (1947), which is now listed on the National Film Registry of the U.S. Library of Congress. Biography Born in Gelnhausen, near Frankfurt, Fischinger apprenticed at an organ-building firm after he finished school until the owners were drafted into World War I. The next year he worked as a draftsman in an architect's office, until he too was called to duty. However, since he was too \\"unhealthy\\", he was rejected from combat duty. After the war, the Fischinger family moved west to Frankfurt. There Fischinger attended a trade school and worked as an apprentice,eventually obtaining an Engineer's Diploma. =Early career= In Frankfurt, Fischinger met the theatre critic Bernhard Diebold, who in 1921 introduced Fischinger to the work and personage of Walter Ruttmann, a pioneer in abstract film. At this time, Fischinger was experimenting with colored liquids and three-dimensional modelling materials such as wax and clay. He invented a \\"Wax Slicing Machine\\", which synchronized a vertical slicer with a movie camera's shutter, enabling the efficient imaging of progressive cross- sections through a length of molded wax and clay. Fischinger wrote to Ruttmann about his machine, who expressed interest. Moving to Munich, Fischinger licensed the wax slicing machine to Ruttmann, who used it to make some backgrounds for Lotte Reiniger's Prince Achmed film. During this time Fischinger shot many abstract tests of his own using the machine. Some of these are distributed today under the assigned title Wax Experiments. In 1924, Fischinger formed a company with American entrepreneur Louis Seel to produce satirical cartoons that tended toward mature audiences. One survives in his film estate, Pierrette I. He also continued to make abstract films and tests of his own, trying new and different techniques, including multiple projector performances. \\"In 1926 and 1927, Fischinger performed his own multiple projector film shows with various musical accompaniments. These shows were titled Fieber (Fever), Vakuum, and Macht (Power)'\\". Facing financial difficulties, Fischinger borrowed from his family, and then his landlady. Finally, in an effort to escape bill collectors, Fischinger decided to surreptitiously depart Munich for Berlin in June 1927. Taking only his essential equipment, he walked 350 miles through the countryside, shooting single frames that were released many decades later as the film Walking from Munich to Berlin. =Berlin= Arriving in Berlin, Fischinger borrowed some money from a relative and set up a studio on Friedrichstra√üe. He soon was creating special effects for various films. His own proposals for cartoons were not accepted by producers or distributors, however.Moritz. (2004). p.22. In 1928, he was hired to work on the feature film Woman in the Moon (German: Frau im Mond), directed by Fritz Lang, which provided him a steady salary for a time. On his own time, he experimented with charcoal-on-paper animation. He produced a series of abstract Studies that were synchronized to popular and classical music. A few of the early Studies were synchronized to new record releases by Electrola, and screened at first-run theatres with a tail credit advertising the record, thus making them, in a sense, the very first music videos. The Studies ‚Äî Numbers 1 through 12 ‚Äî were well received and many were distributed to first-run theatres worldwide, as far as Japan and South America. His Studie Nr. 5 screened at the 1931 \\"Congress for Colour-Music Research\\" to critical acclaim. In 1932, Universal Pictures purchased distribution rights to one of the Studies for the American public. The special effects Fischinger did for clients' films and commercials led to his being called \\"the Wizard of Friedrichstra√üe\\". In 1932, Fischinger married Elfriede Fischinger, a first cousin from his hometown of Gelnhausen. As the Nazis consolidated power after 1933, the abstract film and art communities and distribution possibilities quickly disappeared as the Nazis instituted their policies against what they termed \\"degenerate art\\". His brother Hans Fischinger showed his absolute film \\"Tanz der Farben\\" (i.e. The Dance of Colors) in Hamburg in 1939. Oskar Fischinger continued to make films, and commercials and advertisements, among them Muratti greift ein (translated as Muratti Gets in the Act, or Muratti Marches On) (1934), for a cigarette company, and Kreise (Circles) (1933-34), for the Tolirag advertising agency. The color Muratti commercial with its stop-motion dancing cigarettes screened all over the world. Fischinger managed to complete his abstract work Komposition in Blau in 1935. It was well-received critically, and contrary to popular myth, was legally registered.Moritz. (2004). p.207 An agent from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer screened prints of Komposition in Blau and Muratti in a small art theatre in Hollywood, and Ernst Lubitsch was impressed by the films and the audience's enthusiastic response to the shorts. An agent from Paramount Pictures telephoned Fischinger, asking if he was willing to work in the United States, and Fischinger promptly agreed. =Hollywood= Upon arriving in Hollywood in February 1936, Fischinger was given an office at Paramount Studios, German-speaking secretaries, an English tutor, and a weekly salary of $250.($4400 in 2017 dollars, adjusted for inflation). He and Elfriede socialized with the √©migr√© community. As he waited for his assignment to begin, Fischinger sketched and painted.Moritz. (2004). p.67. He prepared a film which was originally named Radio Dynamics, but known today as Allegretto, tightly synchronized to Ralph Rainger's tune \\"Radio Dynamics\\". This short film was planned for inclusion in the feature film The Big Broadcast of 1937 (1936). However, Paramount only planned to release in black-and-white film, which was not communicated to Fischinger when he began his work. Paramount would not allow even a test in color of Fischinger's film. Fischinger requested to be let out of his contract and left Paramount. Several years later, with the help of Hilla von Rebay and a grant from the Museum of Non- Objective Painting (later The Guggenheim), he was able to buy the film back from Paramount. Fischinger then redid and re-painted the cels and made a color version to his satisfaction which he then called Allegretto. According to biographer William Moritz, this became one of the most-screened and successful films of visual music's history, and one of Fischinger's most popular films. Most of Fischinger's filmmaking attempts in America suffered difficulties. According to Moritz, Fischinger composed An Optical Poem (1937) to Franz Liszt's Second Hungarian Rhapsody for MGM, but received no profits due to studio bookkeeping systems. He designed the J. S. Bach Toccata and Fugue in D Minor sequence for Walt Disney's Fantasia (1940), but quit without credit because Disney altered his designs to be more representational. According to William Moritz, Fischinger contributed to the effects animation of the Blue Fairy's wand in Pinocchio (1940). In the 1950s, Fischinger created several animated TV advertisements, including one for Muntz TV. The Museum of Non- Objective Painting commissioned him to synchronize a film with a march by John Philip Sousa in order to demonstrate loyalty to America, and then insisted that he make a film to Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 3, even though he wanted to make a film without sound in order to affirm the integrity of his non-objective imagery. Secretly, Fischinger composed the silent film Radio Dynamics (1942). Frustrated in his filmmaking, Fischinger turned increasingly to oil painting as a creative outlet. According to Moritz, though the Guggenheim Foundation specifically requested a cel animation film, Fischinger made his Bach film Motion Painting No. 1 (1947) as a documentation of the act of painting, taking a single frame each time he made a brush stroke‚Äîand the multi-layered style merely parallels the structure of the Bach music without any tight synchronization. Although he never again received funding for any of his personal films (only some commercial work), the Motion Painting No. 1 won the Grand Prix at the Brussels International Experimental Film Competition in 1949. Three of Fischinger's films also made the 1984 Olympiad of Animation's list of the world's greatest films. Fischinger died in Los Angeles in 1967. According to Center for Visual Music (the archive of his papers and films), a great deal of inaccurate information continues to be published about Fischinger, largely taken from decades-old sources, often repeated online. The Academy Film Archive has preserved many of Oskar Fischinger's films, including Motion Painting No. 1, Squares, and Spirals. Lumigraph In the late 1940s Fischinger invented the Lumigraph (patented in 1955) which some have mistakenly called a type of color organ. Fischinger had hoped to make the Lumigraph a commercial product, widely available for anyone, but this did not happen. The instrument produced imagery by pressing against a rubberized screen so it could protrude into a narrow beam of colored light. As a visual instrument, the size of its screen was limited by the reach of the performer. Two people were required to operate the Lumigraph: one to manipulate the screen to create imagery, and a second to change the colors of the lights on cue. The device itself was silent, but was performed accompanying various music. Fischinger gave several performances in Los Angeles and one in San Francisco in the early 1950s, performing various classical and popular music pieces, and many were impressed by the machine's spectacular images. In 1964 the Lumigraph was used in the science fiction film The Time Travelers, in which it became a 'lumichord', although this was not Fischinger's intent, but the decision of the film's producers. Fischinger's son Conrad even built two more machines in different sizes. After his death, his widow Elfriede and daughter Barbara gave performances with the Lumigraph, along with William Moritz, in Europe and the US. An extensive history of the Lumigraph, including a discography of music used in its performances, can be found in Cindy Keefer's interview with Barbara Fischinger, in Keefer's 2013 Fischinger monograph. Today one of the instruments is in the collection of the Deutsches Filmmuseum in Frankfurt, and the other two are in California. In February 2007 Barbara Fischinger performed on the original Lumigraph in Frankfurt, and in 2012 in Amsterdam. Film and video documentation of Elfriede's Lumigraph performances are at the Center for Visual Music in Los Angeles, as well as documentation of Barbara's 2012 rehearsal, showing how the Lumigraph is operated.

Bradley (born 4 January 1949) is one of the twelve engineers who worked on the original IBM PC, developing the computer's ROM BIOS code. Bradley is credited for implementing the \\"Control-Alt-Delete\\" (Ctrl-Alt-Del) key combination that was used to reboot the computer. Bradley joined IBM in 1975 after earning his doctorate in electrical engineering from Purdue University with a dissertation on computer architectures. Education Bachelors, Electrical Engineering, University of Dayton (Ohio), 1971. Master of Science, Electrical Engineering, Purdue University, 1972. PhD, Electrical Engineering, Purdue University, 1975. Control-Alt-Delete According to Bradley, Control-Alt-Delete was not intended to be used by end users, originally--it was meant to be used by people writing programs or documentation, so that they could reboot their computers without powering them down. This was useful since after a computer was powered down, it was necessary to wait a few seconds before powering it up again to avoid potential damage to the power supply and hard drive. Since software developers and technical writers would need to restart a computer many times, this key combination was a big time-saver. David Bradley and Mel Hallerman chose this key combination because it is practically impossible to accidentally press this combination of keys on a standard original IBM PC keyboard. However, the key combination was described in IBM's technical reference documentation and thereby revealed to the general public. At the 20th anniversary of the IBM PC on August 8, 2001 at The Tech Museum, while on a panel with Bill Gates, Bradley said, \\"I have to share the credit. I may have invented it [Control- Alt-Delete], but I think Bill made it famous.\\"Control-Alt-Delete: David Bradley & Bill Gates, video clip from IBM PC 20th Anniversary, Aug 8, 2001 (posted to YouTube on Jan 7, 2011) Multiple-key reboot had been introduced by Exidy, Inc., in 1978, for its Sorcerer Z80 computer. It provided two Reset buttons, required to be pressed simultaneously to achieve reboot. In March 1980, the multiple-key reboot concept had been introduced for the Apple II by Videx in its VideoTerm display card add-on, requiring Control-Reset, rather than just simply Reset, to reboot the machine. The innovation was noted and well received at the time. Other accomplishments Bradley is the author of Assembly Language Programming for the IBM Personal Computer (Simon & Schuster, , January 1984), also released in French as Assembleur sur IBM PC (Dunod, ), Russian (\\"Radio\\" Publishing House, Moscow), and Bulgarian (\\"Technica\\" Publishing house, 1989). Bradley holds seven U.S. patents. Bradley has been adjunct professor of electrical and computer engineering at Florida Atlantic University and at North Carolina State University. Much of Bradley's career has been at IBM. Bradley received a B.E.E. degree in 1971 from the University of Dayton, (Ohio). He went on to Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, where he completed an M.S. degree in 1972 and Ph.D. in 1975, both in electrical engineering. Upon graduation he went to work for IBM in Boca Raton, Florida, as senior associate engineer. He worked on the Series/1 system. In 1978 he developed the I/O system for the System/23 Datamaster. In 1980 Bradley was one of twelve engineers developing the first IBM Personal Computer. Bradley developed the ROM BIOS. That got him promoted to manage the BIOS and diagnostics for the IBM PC/XT. In 1983 Bradley formed the Personal Systems Architecture Department. In 1984 he helped manage development of the Personal System/2 Model 30. In November 1987 Bradley became manager of advanced processor design. His group developed the 486/25 Power Platform and the PS/2 Models 90 and 95. In 1991 he became manager of systems architecture for the Entry Systems Technology group. In 1992 he became the architecture manager for the group that developed a personal computer using the PowerPC RISC microprocessor. In 1993 he returned to be the manager of architecture in the PC group. On January 30, 2004, Bradley retired from IBM. Bradley wrote about the development of the IBM PC, including Control-Alt-Delete, in the August 2011 issue of the IEEE Computer magazine.

It was founded as the Doubleday & McClure Company in 1897 and was the largest in the United States by 1947. It published the work of mostly U.S. authors under a number of imprints and distributed them through its own stores. In 2009 Doubleday merged with Knopf Publishing Group to form the Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, which is now part of Penguin Random House. In 2019, the official website presents Doubleday as an imprint, not a publisher. History The firm was founded as Doubleday & McClure Company in 1897 by Frank Nelson Doubleday in partnership with Samuel Sidney McClure. McClure had founded the first U.S. newspaper syndicate in 1884 (McClure Syndicate) and the monthly McClure's Magazine in 1893. One of their first bestsellers was The Day's Work by Rudyard Kipling, a short story collection that Macmillan published in Britain late in 1898. Other authors published by the company in its early years include W. Somerset Maugham and Joseph Conrad. Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. later served as a vice-president of the company. The partnership ended in 1900. McClure and John Sanborn Phillips, the co-founder of his magazine, formed McClure, Phillips and Company. Doubleday and Walter Hines Page formed Doubleday, Page & Company. The racist but best- selling novels of Thomas Dixon Jr. (The Leopard's Spots, 1902; The Clansman, 1905) \\"changed a struggling publishing venture into the empire that Doubleday was to become\\". At the same time, Doubleday helped Dixon launch his writing career. Page and Dixon were both from North Carolina and had known each other in Raleigh. In 1910, Doubleday, Page & Co. moved its operations, which included a train station, to Garden City. The company purchased much of the land on the east side of Franklin Avenue, and estate homes were built for many of its executives on Fourth Street. Co-founder and Garden City resident Walter Hines Page was named Ambassador to Great Britain in 1916. In 1922 the company founded its juvenile department, the second in the nation, with May Massee as head. The founder's son Nelson Doubleday joined the firm in the same year. In 1927, Doubleday, Page merged with the George H. Doran Company, creating Doubleday, Doran, then the largest publishing business in the English-speaking world. In 1944, Doubleday, Doran acquired the Philadelphia medical publisher Blakiston. In 1946, the company became Doubleday and Company. Nelson Doubleday resigned as president, but continued as chairman of the board until his death on January 11, 1949. Douglas Black took over as president from 1946 to 1963. His tenure attracted numerous public figures to the publishing company, including Dwight D. Eisenhower, Harry S. Truman, Douglas MacArthur, Robert Taft, and Andr√© Malraux. He was a strong opponent of censorship and felt that it was his responsibility to the American public to publish controversial titles. Black also expanded Doubleday's publishing program by opening two new printing plants; creating a new line of quality paperbacks, under the imprint Anchor Books; attracting new book clubs to its book club division; opening 30 new retail stores in 25 cities; and opening new editorial offices in San Francisco, London, and Paris. By 1947, Doubleday was the largest publisher in the US, with annual sales of over 30 million books. In 1954, Doubleday sold Blakiston to McGraw-Hill. Doubleday's son-in-law John Sargent was president and CEO from 1963 to 1978. In 1964, Doubleday acquired the educational publisher Laidlaw. In 1967 the company purchased the Dallas-based Trigg-Vaughn group of radio and TV stations to create Doubleday Broadcasting. After expanding during the 1970s and 1980s, Doubleday sold the broadcasting division in 1986. Nelson Doubleday, Jr. succeeded John Sargent as President and CEO from 1978 to 1985. In 1976, Doubleday bought paperback publisher Dell Publishing. In 1980, the company bought the New York Mets baseball team. The Mets defeated the Boston Red Sox to win the World Series in 1986 in a 7-game contest. By 1985, Doubleday & Company was seeing a decline in sales from 1980 and hired James R. McLaughlin, the head of Dell Publishing, a Doubleday subsidiary, to streamline and downsize. McLaughlin went on to succeed Doubleday in as President and CEO, with Doubleday becoming Chairman of the Board. By 1986 the firm was a fully integrated international communications company, doing trade publishing, mass-market paperback publishing, book clubs, and book manufacturing, together with ventures in broadcasting and advertising. The company had offices in London and Paris and wholly owned subsidiaries in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, with joint ventures in the UK and the Netherlands. Nelson Doubleday, Jr. sold the publishing company to Bertelsmann in 1986 for a reported $475 million. The deal did not include the Mets which Nelson Doubleday and minority owner Fred Wilpon had purchased from Doubleday & Company for $85 million. In 2002, Doubleday sold his stake in the Mets to Wilpon for $135 million after a feud over the monetary value of the team. After the purchase, Bertelsmann sold Laidlaw to Macmillan Inc.. In 1988, portions of the firm became part of the Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, which in turn became a division of Random House in 1998. Doubleday was combined in a group with Broadway Books, Anchor Books was combined with Vintage Books as a division of Knopf, while Bantam and Dell became a separate group. In 1996, Doubleday founded the Christian publisher WaterBrook Press. WaterBrook acquired Harold Shaw Publishers in 2000 and Multnomah Publishers in 2006. In late 2008 and early 2009, the Doubleday imprint merged with Knopf Publishing Group to form the Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. In October 2008, Doubleday laid off about 10% of its staff (16 people) across all departments. The Broadway, Doubleday Business, Doubleday Religion, and WaterBrook Multnomah divisions were moved to Crown Publishing Group.

It is also an example of the Mediterranean diet based on the importance of olive oil, fruits, vegetables and fish. The cooking traditions of the Albanian people are diverse in consequence of the environmental factors that are more importantly suitable for the cultivation of nearly all kinds of herbs, vegetables and fruits. Olive oil is the most ancient and commonly used vegetable fat in Albanian cooking, produced since antiquity throughout the country particularly along the coasts. Hospitality is a fundamental custom of Albanian society and serving food is integral to the hosting of guests and visitors. It is not infrequent for visitors to be invited to eat and drink with locals. The medieval Albanian code of honour, called besa, resulted to look after guests and strangers as an act of recognition and gratitude. Albanian cuisine can be divided into three major regional cuisines. The cuisine of the northern region has a rural, coastal and mountainous origin. Meat, fish and vegetables are central to the cuisine of the northern region. The people there use many kinds of ingredients, which usually grow in the region including potatoes, carrots, maizes, beans, cabbages but also cherries, walnuts and almonds. Garlic and onions are as well important components to the local cuisine and added to almost every dish. The cuisine of the central region is threefold of rural, mountainous and coastal. The central region is the flattest and rich in vegetation and biodiversity as well as culinary specialties. It has Mediterranean characteristics due to its proximity to the sea, which is rich in fish. Dishes here include several meat specialties and desserts of all kinds. In the south, the cuisine is composed of two components: the rural products of the field including dairy products, citrus fruits and olive oil, and coastal products, i.e. seafood. Those regions are particularly conducive to raising animals, as pastures and feed resources are abundant. Besides garlic, onions are arguably the country's most widely used ingredient. Albania is ranked fourth in the world in terms of onion consumption per capita.  Characteristics and meals  The strategic location of Albania in the western Balkan Peninsula with a direct proximity to the Mediterranean Sea has a large influence on Albanian cuisine. Many foods that are common in the Mediterranean Basin, such as olives, wheat, chickpeas, dairy products, fish, fruits and vegetables, are prominent in the Albanian cooking tradition. Albania has a distinctly Mediterranean climate. Across the country's territory, there are a wide range of microclimates due to differing soil types and topography that allow a variety of products to be grown. Citrus fruits such as oranges and lemons, figs and olives thrive in the country. Citrus fruits are mostly cultivated in the south of Albania. Breakfast in Albania. Every region has its own typical breakfast. Breakfast often consists of a light meal. Fresh bread is frequently eaten and served with butter, cheese, jam and yogurt, accompanied with olives, coffee, milk, tea or raki. It is common to have only fruit or a slice of bread and a cup of coffee or tea for breakfast. Coffee and tea is enjoyed both in homes or at the many caf√©s that feature in towns and cities throughout the country. Lunch is traditionally the biggest meal of the day: dinner for Albanians. Everyone in Albania enjoys this lunch break, from school children to shop workers and government officials. Traditionally, people go back to their houses to have lunch with their families, but it is now common to have lunch with groups of friends at restaurants or cafeterias. Lunch sometimes consists of gjell√´, a main dish of slowly cooked meat with various vegetables, accompanied by a salad of fresh vegetables, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers, onions and olives. Salads are typically served with meat dishes and are dressed with salt, virgin olive oil, white vinegar or lemon juice. Grilled or fried vegetables and sausages and various forms of omelettes are also eaten during lunch, accompanied by coffee, tea, fruit juices and milk. Supper in Albania is a smaller meal, often consisting only of a variety of breads, meat, fresh fish or seafood, cheese, eggs and various kind of vegetables, similar to breakfast, or possibly sandwiches.  Ingredients  Garlic is popular throughout the country. Located in Southern Europe with a direct proximity to the Mediterranean Sea, the Albanian cuisine features a wide range of fresh fruits, growing naturally in the fertile Albanian soil and under the warm sun. In consideration of being an agricultural country, Albania is a significant fruit importer and exporter. Besides citrus fruits, cherries, strawberries, blueberries and raspberries are among the most cultivated fruits. Many Albanians keep fruit trees in their yards. Fresh and dried fruits are eaten as snacks and desserts. Fruits that are traditionally associated with Albanian cuisine include apple, grape, olive, orange, nectarine, blackberry, cherry, persimmon, pomegranate, figs, watermelon, avocado, lemon, peach, plum, strawberries, raspberry, mulberry and cornelian cherry. A wide variety of vegetables are frequently used in Albanian cooking. Due to the different climate and soil conditions across Albania, cultivars of cabbages, turnips, beetroots, beans, potatoes, leeks and mushrooms can be found in a rich variety. Dried or pickled vegetables are also processed, especially in drier or colder regions such as in the remote Albanian Alps, where fresh vegetables were hard to get out of season. Particularly used vegetables include onion, garlic, tomato, cucumber, carrot, pepper, spinach, lettuce, grape leaves, bean, eggplant and zucchini. Oregano is among the most commonly used herbs in Albanian cuisine. Herbs are very popular. A wide variety are readily available at supermarkets or local produce stands across the country. The proximity to the Mediterranean Sea and the ideal climatic conditions allows the cultivation of about 250 aromatic and medical plants. Albania is among the leading producers and exporter of herbs in the world. Further, the country is a worldwide significant producer of oregano, thyme, sage, salvia, rosemary and yellow gentian. Most commonly used herbs and other seasonings in Albanian cooking include artichoke, basil, chili pepper, cinnamon, coriander, lavender, oregano, peppermint, rosemary, thyme, bay, vanilla, saffron.  Drinks  Mountain tea has a long tradition in Albania and is the most popular tea of the locals. Tea is a widely consumed beverage throughout Albania and particularly served at caf√©s, restaurants or at home. The country is rich in the cultivation of a wide range of herbs. The most popular varieties of tea drinking in Albania include Albanian-style mountain tea, which grows in the Albanian mountains and villages, and Russian- and Turkish-style black tea with sugar to tea with lemon, milk or honey. Coffee is another popular beverage in Albania, but more particularly in the cities and villages. There are various varieties of coffee popular in Albania, including filter coffee and instant coffee such as espresso, cappuccino, macchiato, mocha and latte. Caf√©s are found everywhere in urban areas and function as meeting places for socializing and conducting business. Almost all serve baked goods and sandwiches and many also serve light meals. Tirana is particularly well known for its caf√© culture. Cafes along Mustafa Matohiti St near Blloku district in central Tirana In 2016, Albania surpassed Spain by becoming the country with the most coffee houses per capita in the world. In fact, there are 654 coffee houses per 100,000 inhabitants in Albania, a country with only 2.5 million inhabitants. Dhall√´ is a traditional and healthy yogurt-based drink in Albania made by blending yogurt with water or milk and spices. It is especially popular during the summer month and it may be served with salt, according to taste. Boza, is a malt drink made from maize (corn) and wheat which is widely consumed with desserts in Albania. Grapes in Berat. Albanian wine is known for its local varieties and distinct sweetness Raki is the most popular spirit in Albania. It is considered as the national spirit beverage of the country. The most common types of raki in the country are grape, plum or blackberry. It is commonly served to the older people and is heated and sweetened with honey or sugar, with added spices. Although in the south of the country, Raki rigoni is very popular among the people and is made of white oregano, that is cultivated in the region. Albania is a traditionally wine drinking country. The people of Albania drink wine in moderation and almost always at meals or social occasions. Islam is the majority religion in Albania and while observant Muslims tend to avoid the consumption of alcohol, it is available in the country. Albanians drink about 5.83 liters of wine per person per year, which has been increasing since the Albanian production of high-quality wine grows to meet demand. The origins of wine production in Albania can be traced back to 6,000 years and evidence suggesting wine production confirm that Albania is among the earliest wine producer in Europe.  Pastries and desserts  There is a strong tradition of home baking in the country and p√¢tisseries are present in every city and village across the country. Entirely Albanian desserts and pastries consist primarily of fruits including oranges and lemons that grow as well as in the country. Traditionally, fresh fruits are often eaten after a meal as a dessert. Those dishes are inspired from both Western and Eastern civilizations. Baklava Kanoj√´t is a typical Sicilian pastry and very common among the Arb√´resh√´ people, which brought that dish back into their homelands, Albania where it is popular. It is made of tube-shaped shells of fried pastry dough, filled with a sweet, creamy filling usually containing ricotta. The kanoj√´t from Piana degli Albanesi, an Arb√´resh√´ village, are often referred to be the best cannolo. Baklava is made frequently in Albania, especially around certain religious holidays of Muslims, Catholics and Orthodox. It is prepared on large trays and cut into a variety of shapes. Baklava is either with hazelnuts or walnuts sweetened with syrup. Petulla is a traditional fried dough made from wheat or buckwheat flour, which is as well a popular dish among the Albanians and served with powdered sugar or feta cheese and raspberry jam. Pandispanj√´ is a traditional base for several Albanian desserts and cakes based on flour, sugar, butter and eggs. A variety of fillings are used, such as jelly, chocolate, fruit and pastry cream. Blackberry jam Ballokume is an Albanian cookie, which originated in Elbasan during the Middle Ages and prepared every year on Summer Day, a public holiday in the country. It has to be brewed in large copper pots, tightly whipped with a wooden spoon and baked in a wood oven. Fruit jam, also known as Re√ßel, is enjoyed all year in Albania and a major component of the Albanian cooking tradition. The fruit preserve is made by cooking the juice of the fruit or the fruit itself, which usually grow in Albania, with sugar. It is served to many dishes as a side dish. Zupa is a popular dessert and assembled by alternating layers of cookies or sponge cake with pastry cream. Another similar dessert is an Albanian custard dessert called krem karamele very similar to cr√®me br√ªl√©e. This dessert is made with milk, cream, egg yolks, sugar, vanilla and flavored with orange or lemon zest and cinnamon. Tamb√´loriz Various kinds of hallv√´ are prepared across the country with some of the most common types being flour halva. Although home-cooked semolina halva and shop-produced sesame halva are also consumed. It is a typical sweet in local religious fairs around Albania. Tamb√´loriz, also known as sultjash, is a popular sweet among the Albanian population across the world. It is a kind of rice pudding made from milk, rice, cinnamon and nuts, raisins can be added, too. Tollumba is a fried, crispy, and sweet dessert traditionally eaten in the Balkan Peninsula. Further, it is made of bits of fried dough, similar to doughnuts, steeped in much lemony syrup. The dough contains starch and semolina, which keeps it light and crispy. Akullore Akullore is the Albanian word for ice cream and it is enjoyed both summer and winter. Ice cream is a popular dessert across the country's territory after a long meal. It is available at restaurants, p√¢tisseries and bars throughout Albania. Kadaif is a pastry made from long thin noodle threads filled with walnuts or pistachios and sweetened with syrup, it is sometimes served alongside baklava. Kabuni is a traditional cold- served Albanian dessert made of rice fried in butter, mutton broth, raisins, salt and caramelized sugar. It is then boiled before sugar, cinnamon, and ground cloves are added. Pastashu Pastashu is made from choux pastry, filled with a cream, vanilla, coffee or chocolate-flavoured custard and then topped usually with fondant icing. This dessert is known as √âclair in France and Bign√® in Italy Trile√ße is an Albanian adaptation of the Spanish Tres leches. It is a sponge cake made of three milks from cow's, goat's and water buffaloes, while cow's milk and cream are used commonly. According to H√ºrriyet, Albania was the first country to introduce the dessert from South America into the area. It is believed that the popularity of Brazilian soap operas in Albania led local chefs to reverse-engineer the dessert and then the speciality spread over to Turkey. Ashure, the world oldest dessert, is served especially during Muslim (Bektashi) holidays in Albania. It is a congee that is made of a mixture consisting of grains, nuts as well as fruits and dried fruits. Homemade panettone, an Italian type of sweet bread loaf, is usually prepared and particularly enjoyed for Christmas and New Year in Albania.  Appetizers and salads  A typical Albanian vegetable salad. Popular appetizers in Albania includes wheat bread or cornbread, which remains one of the most important foods and are ever-present on the Albanian table. Hence the expression for 'going to eat a meal' (Albanian: p√´r t√´ ngr√´n√´ buk√´) can be literally translated as 'going to eat bread'. In Albania, bread is also used in the authentic Albanian hospitality saying of \\"bread, salt and heart\\" (buk√´, krip√´ e zem√´r). Vegetable salads are almost served along with both lunch and dinner, which in majority are dishes based on meat. The ingredients that are used always in salads are green or red peppers, onions, tomatoes, olives and cucumbers. Salads that are representative of the Albanian cuisine are dressed with salt, olive oil or lemon and vinegar. The usual dressings are based on garlic, lemon and black pepper. Speca t√´ ferguara (roasted peppers) served with Pite. An Albanian-style meze of fresh and cooked vegetable salads, pickled cucumbers and other vegetables, hard boiled eggs, prosciutto ham, salami and feta cheese, accompanied with roasted bell peppers, olive oil and garlic is served at festive meals and in restaurants. Nowadays, the modern interpretations of the Albanian meze blend traditional and modern combination of various appetizers. F√´rges√´ veror√´ (summer f√´rges√´), is the vegetarian version of f√´rges√´, a national dish in Albania made of green and red peppers, along with skinned tomatoes and onions and often served as a side dish to various meat dishes. Japrak is a stuffed vegetable dish made with grape leaves, olive oil and stuffed with rice, grilled beef and chopped onions and generally served cold with bread and tarator. Buk√´ misri (cornbread) Tarator is a cold appetizer and usually served cold as a side dish during the hot summer months. The ingredients of tarator include cucumber, garlic, olive oil, salt and yoghurt. Fried and grilled vegetables and seafood are usually offered with tarator. Large white kidney beans (fasulle plaqi) are a typical appetizer or side dish, baked in an earthen pot with tomatoes, onions, peppermint, oregano, bay leaves and black pepper. A variety of soups are enjoyed, particularly in the winter. Especially popular soups are potato, cabbage, bean and fish soups. Trahana is a popular soup in the Eastern Mediterranean. It based on a fermented mixture of wheat and fermented milk. Other dishes include Grosh√´t and Shqeto, which originated from Lunxheri region of Gjirokast√´r. Other dishes include m√´lci pule, eggplant appetizers, panaret which is famous among Arb√´resh√´s, stuffed peppers composed of green peppers stuffed with rice, meat, other vegetables and herbs, turshi lakre, fried sardele me Limon, papare, which are bread leftovers cooked with water, egg, butter, and Gjiz√´ (salted curd cheese) and bread and cheese referred as Buk√´ me djath√´.  Meat and fish  Ohrid trout is an ancient trout and only found in Lake Ohrid. The country's cuisine is largely meat-based. Beef and veal are the most commonly consumed meats in Albania, followed by pork. Albania has many small eateries specializing in beef and lamb, goat and veal. In high elevation localities, smoked meat and pickled preserves are common. Animal organs are also used in dishes such as intestines and the head among other parts, which are considered a delicacy. The most common poultry consumed is chicken and duck. Chicken is prepared in a multitude of ways, from simple oven roasted to elaborate casseroles with rich sauces. As a country with an Islamic majority, Muslim Albanians follow Islamic dietary laws which forbids the consumption of pork. Although, in other parts across of Albania where there are significant numbers of non-Muslims, pork specialities are commonly consumed. Scampi are popular along the coasts. Fresh fish is readily available and caught off the coastal areas of the Adriatic and Ionian Sea inside the Mediterranean Sea but also from the Lake Butrint, Lake Shkod√´r, Lake Ohrid, Lake Prespa as well as Karavasta Lagoon, Narta Lagoon and Patos Lagoon. Fresh fish is served whole, in the Mediterranean style, grilled, boiled, fried whole or in slices, dressed only with freshly squeezed lemon juice. Fish dishes are often flavoured with white vinegar and virgin olive oil, which particularly grows in Southern Albania. Albanians living on the coastal cities, especially in Durr√´s, Sarand√´ and Vlor√´ are passionate about their seafood specialties. Popular seafood dishes include trout, calamari, octopus, cuttlefish, red mullet, sea bass, gilt-head bream and other. Baked whiting, carp, mullet or eel with olive oil and garlic are also widely consumed in the country. Qebapa. F√´rges√´ is the most iconic dish from Tirana and Central Albania. It consists of liver or beef cooked with peppers, tomatoes, onions and gjiz√´ (a kind of cottage cheese, denser than ricotta). Ingredients are cooked on the stove and then in the oven to make a relatively dense sauce. F√´rges√´ with liver is considered more traditional in Tirana and is thus sometimes called just f√´rges√´ tirane. Ferges√´ with beef Tav√´ Kosi is a national dish in Albania that is beloved throughout the country. The speciality is a simple dish of baked lamb and rice, served with a flavored yogurt sauce. Recently, it has become very popular among the Greeks and Turks associated to the large Albanian diaspora in Greece and Turkey. Qebapa are small homemade grilled meat skinless sausages made of lamb and beef mix. It is primarily served with onions, sour cream, ajvar and pita bread called pitalka. Gullash Gullash, or tasqebap, is actually eaten very frequently in the mountainous areas of Albania. It's a traditional paprika-spiced meat stew originating in Hungary that is popular throughout Central Europe and the Balkans. Gjel deti me p√´rshesh (turkeywith p√´rshesh) is the usual New Year's dish in many Albanian families and also consumed in other kind of celebrations. Turkey is first boiled and then roasted and served with p√´rshesh, which is prepared by baking pieces of kula√ß (a kind of bread) with turkey broth, along with mint and other spices. Pa√ße is traditionally common in Albania. It is made with a sheep's, pig's or any cattle's head, boiled until meat comes off easily. It is then stewed with garlic, onion, black pepper and vinegar. Sometimes a little flour is added to thicken the stew. It makes a hot and hearty winter stew. Proshute is a term used in Albania for many types of salami and ham, which has been seasoned, cured and air-dried. It is served rather at breakfast or lunch as an appetizer. Dishes which consist of proshute include Omelete me Proshute dhe Djathe, Role buke me Proshute and Sallate Orizi me Pjeper dhe Proshute. Qofte are fried meatballs, which are usually made of minced meat, herbs and spices and cooked with tomato sauce and vegetables or beans. Throughout the country there are few specialized shops called Qofteri, which offer qofte and beer. Mimilige is made of cornmeal that is boiled in water with the intestines of lamb, butter, cheese and corn flour. This warm dish can be baked, grilled, fried or served creamy. It is a very prominent dish in the Lab√´ria region.  Pies  Pite me Mish or Byrek Albanian pies are among the most characteristic and emblematic dishes in traditional cuisine. They can be either sweet or savory. Thus, a piece of such a pie may well serve as the main dish of a meal. Pite is considered as well as one of the national food of Albania and most of Albanians. Pite is a pie made up of homemade filo pastry with many different types with the most common being Pite me Spinaq, Pite me Mish and Pite me Djath. Several internationally renowned musicians of Albanian heritage such as Rita Ora, Dua Lipa and Action Bronson have spread their passion about this Albanian dish. Flia Flia is a traditional layered pancake brushed with cream made with simple ingredients and baked slowly over a few hours. It is often served hot, fresh and with pickled vegetables, honey, yogurt or fruit jam. Nowadays, flia mainly features in large social gatherings, weddings, births and other ceremonies and events. Bakllasar√´m is a layered pie, otherwise known as Pite, without anything inside, which is covered with yogurt and garlic and then heated again. It is particularly eaten for lunch. Another popular dish is Kungullur, which is made of filo pastry layers filled with mashed pumpkin, butter, salt or sugar. Notable pies include Byrek, Pepeq, Shaprak, Qollopita or Lakror. Lakror is similar to byrek however, it is thinner as it has layers of dough and it is traditionally cooked on embers, covered with a metal semispherical lid. Common fillings are leek and gjiz√´ or tomato and onion. It is a specialty of Southern Albanian regions, like Lunxheri or Kor√ßa.  Health benefits  Albanian cuisine falls within the category of the \\"Mediterranean diet,\\" which includes low consumption of meat and milk products and a high consumption of carbohydrates, vegetables, fruit and olive oil.Gjonca, A., & Bobak, M. (1997). Albanian paradox, another example of protective effect of Mediterranean lifestyle? The Lancet, 350(9094). Retrieved June 28, 2018, from https://search.proquest.com/docview/198996405 It is believed that because of this diet Albania has a very high life expectancy when its economic power is compared to other countries, characterized by some researchers as the \\"Albanian paradox\\". This causes the country to not be affected by cardiovascular and coronary diseases when compared to countries like Hungary or Poland which have a two-to-three-times higher death rate from those diseases.

It is an area of study within musical acoustics. String length, mass and tension Strings vary in length and thickness, so that many octaves can fit on one sounding board The strings of a piano vary in thickness, and therefore in mass per length, with bass strings thicker than treble. A typical range is from 1/30 inch (0.85 mm, string size 13) for the highest treble strings to 1/3 inch (8.5 mm) for the lowest bass. These differences in string thickness follow from well-understood acoustic properties of strings. Given two strings, equally taut and heavy, one twice as long as the other, the longer would vibrate with a pitch one octave lower than the shorter. However, if one were to use this principle to design a piano it would be impossible to fit the bass strings onto a frame of any reasonable size. Furthermore, in such a hypothetical, gigantic piano, the lowest strings would travel so far in vibrating that they would strike one another. Instead, piano makers take advantage of the fact that a heavy string vibrates more slowly than a light string of identical length and tension; thus, the bass strings on the piano are much thicker than the others. The other factor that can affect pitch, other than length, density and mass, is tension. Strings in an upright piano usually have a tension of 750 to 900 N (75-90 kg weight) each. Inharmonicity and piano size Any vibrating thing produces vibrations at a number of frequencies above the fundamental pitch. These are called overtones. When the overtones are integer multiples (e.g., 2√ó, 3√ó ... 6√ó ... ) of the fundamental frequency (called harmonics), then - neglecting damping - the oscillation is periodic‚Äîi.e., it vibrates exactly the same way over and over. Humans seem to enjoy the sound of periodic oscillations. For this reason, many musical instruments, including pianos, are designed to produce nearly periodic oscillations, that is, to have overtones as close as possible to the harmonics of the fundamental tone. In an ideal vibrating string, when the wavelength of a wave on a stretched string is much greater than the thickness of the string, the wave velocity on the string is constant and the overtones are at the harmonics. That is why so many instruments are constructed of skinny strings or thin columns of air. However, for high overtones with short wavelengths that approach the diameter of the string, the string behaves more like a thick metal bar: its mechanical resistance to bending becomes an additional force to the tension, which 'raises the pitch' of the overtones. Only when the bending force is much smaller than the tension of the string, are its wave-speed (and the overtones pitched as harmonics) unchanged. The frequency-raised overtones (above the harmonics), called 'partials', can produce an unpleasant effect called inharmonicity. Basic strategies to reduce inharmonicity include decreasing the thickness of the string or increasing its length, choosing a flexible material with a low bending force, and increasing the tension force so that it stays much bigger than the bending force. Winding a string allows an effective decrease in the thickness of the string. In a wound string, only the inner core resists bending while the windings function only to increase the linear density of the string. The thickness of the inner core is limited by its strength and by its tension; stronger materials allow for thinner cores at higher tensions, reducing inharmonicity. Hence, piano designers choose high quality steel for their strings, as its strength and durability help them minimize string diameters. If string diameter, tension, mass, uniformity, and length compromises were the only factors‚Äîall pianos could be small, spinet- sized instruments. Piano builders, however, have found that longer strings increase instrument power, harmonicity, and reverberation, and help produce a properly tempered tuning scale. With longer strings, larger pianos achieve the longer wavelengths and tonal characteristics desired. Piano designers strive to fit the longest strings possible within the case; moreover, all else being equal, the sensible piano buyer tries to obtain the largest instrument compatible with budget and space. Inharmonicity largely affects the lowest and highest notes in the piano and is one of the limits on the total range of a piano. The lowest strings, which must be longest, are most limited by the size of the piano. The designer of a short piano is forced to use thick strings to increase mass density and is thus driven into inharmonicity. The highest strings must be under the greatest tension, yet must also be thin to allow for a low mass density. The limited strength of steel forces the piano designer to use very short strings whose short wavelengths thus generate inharmonicity. The natural inharmonicity of a piano is used by the tuner to make slight adjustments in the tuning of a piano. The tuner stretches the notes, slightly sharpening the high notes and flatting the low notes to make overtones of lower notes have the same frequency as the fundamentals of higher notes. :See also Piano wire, Piano tuning, Psychoacoustics. The Railsback curve The Railsback curve, indicating the deviation between normal piano tuning and an equal-tempered scale.The Railsback curve, first measured by O.L. Railsback, expresses the difference between normal piano tuning and an equal-tempered scale (one in which the frequencies of successive notes are related by a constant ratio, equal to the twelfth root of two). For any given note on the piano, the deviation between the normal pitch of that note and its equal- tempered pitch is given in cents (hundredths of a semitone). As the Railsback curve shows, octaves are normally stretched on a well-tuned piano. That is, the high notes are higher, and the low notes lower, than they are in an equal- tempered scale. Railsback discovered that pianos were typically tuned in this manner not because of a lack of precision, but because of inharmonicity in the strings. Ideally, the overtone series of a note consists of frequencies that are integer multiples of the note's fundamental frequency. Inharmonicity as present in piano strings makes successive overtones higher than they \\"should\\" be. To tune an octave, a piano technician must reduce the speed of beating between the first overtone of a lower note and a higher note until it disappears. Because of inharmonicity, this first overtone is sharper than a harmonic octave (which has the ratio of 2/1), making either the lower note flatter, or the higher note sharper, depending on which one is tuned relative to the other. To produce octaves that reflect the temperament and accommodate the inharmonicity of the instrument, the technician begins the stretch from the middle of the piano so that, as the stretch accumulates from register to register, it results in the desired stretch at the top and bottom of the instrument. =Shape of the curve= Because string inharmonicity only makes harmonics sharper, the Railsback curve‚Äîwhich is functionally the integral of the inharmonicity at an octave‚Äîis monotonically increasing. A piano is tuned beginning in the center, so the Railsback curve has a shallow slope in this area. But as the piano tuner stretches octaves to compensate for inharmonicity, the stretch accumulates as tuned notes ascend and descend, and their curves become more pronounced. Inharmonicity in a string is caused primarily by stiffness. Decreased length and increased thickness both contribute to inharmonicity. For the middle to high part of the piano range, string thickness remains constant as length decreases, contributing to greater inharmonicity in the higher notes. For the low range, string thickness drastically increases‚Äîespecially in shorter pianos, which cannot compensate with longer strings, which produces greater inharmonicity in this range as well. In the bass register, a second factor affecting the inharmonicity is the resonance caused by the acoustic impedance of the piano sound board. These resonances exhibit positive feedback on the inharmonic effect: if a string vibrates at a frequency just below that of a resonance, the impedance makes it vibrate even lower, and if it vibrates just above a resonance, the impedance makes it vibrate higher. The sounding board has multiple resonant frequencies that are unique to any particular piano. This contributes to the greater variance in the empirically measured Railsback curve in the lower octaves.  Multiple strings  All but the lowest notes of a piano have multiple strings tuned to the same frequency. This allows the piano to have a loud attack with a fast decay but a long sustain in the Attack Decay Sustain Release (ADSR) system. The three strings create a coupled oscillator with three normal modes (with two polarizations each). Since the strings are only weakly coupled, the normal modes have imperceptibly different frequencies. But they transfer their vibrational energy to the sounding board at significantly different rates. The normal mode in which the three strings oscillate together is most efficient at transferring energy since all three strings pull in the same direction at the same time. It sounds loud, but decays quickly. This normal mode is responsible for the rapid staccato \\"Attack\\" part of the note. In the other two normal modes, strings do not all pull together, e.g., one pulls up while the other two pull down. There is slow transfer of energy to the sounding board, generating a soft but near-constant sustain.

She was the founder of the Social-Democratic Party of Albania in 1943. Kokalari was the first female writer of Albania. After a short involvement in politics during World War II, she was persecuted by the communist regime in Albania, and not allowed to write anymore. She died in poverty and complete isolation. Early life Musine Kokalari was born on February 10, 1917 in Adana in southern Turkey of a patriotic and politically active family of Gjirokastrian origin. She returned to Albania with her family in 1920. Musine was early to acquire a taste for books and learning since her brother Vesim operated a bookstore in Tirana in the mid 1930s. In January 1938, she left for Rome to study literature at the university there and graduated in 1941 with a thesis on Naim Frash√´ri. Her stay in the eternal city gave her an ephemeral glimpse into a fascinating world of intellectual creativity and her sole aim in life upon her return to Albania was to become a writer. In 1943, she declared to a friend, \\"I want to write, to write, only to write literature, and to have nothing to do with politics.\\" Publications She had, at the age of twenty-four, indeed already published an initial 80-page collection of ten youthful prose tales in her native Gjirokastrian dialect: As my old mother tells me (), Tirana, 1941. This historic collection, strongly inspired by Tosk folklore and by the day-by-day struggles of women of Gjirokast√´r, is thought to be the first work of literature ever written and published by a woman in Albania. Their value consists of the very lively dialect of Gjirokast√´r and the prevailing mores of the region. Kokalari called the book, \\"the mirror of a world gone by, the path of transition from girlhood with its melodies and the first years of marriage to the world of the grown woman, once again bound by the heavy chains of slavery to patriarchal fanaticism.\\" Three years later, despite the vicissitudes of World War II, Kokalari now twenty-seven, was able to publish a longer collection of short stories and sketches entitled How life swayed (), Tirana, 1944, a total of 348-pages which established her‚Äîever so briefly‚Äîas a writer of substance. A third volume of her folksy tales was entitled Around the Hearth (), Tirana, 1944. After World War II Photo taken during her trial in 1946 As World War II came to an end, Kokalari herself opened a bookstore and was invited to become a member of the Albanian League of Writers and Artists, created on October 7, 1945 under the chairmanship of Sejfulla Mal√´shova. All the time she was haunted by the execution without trial of her two brothers, Mumtaz and Vejsim, on November 12, 1944 by the communists and candidly demanded justice and retribution. Having herself been closely associated in 1944 with the fledgling Albanian Social-Democratic party and its press organ Z√´ri i liris√´ (\\"The voice of freedom\\"), she was arrested on January 17, 1946 in an age of terror concomitant with the arrest of Mal√´shova, and on July 2, 1946 was sentenced to twenty years in prison by the military court of Tirana as a saboteur and enemy of the people. Right before her arrest Kokalari had sent a letter to the Allied Forces, which were still based in the Albanian capital, Tirana. In her letter she called for free elections and freedom of expression. At the trial, Kokalari stated the following: > I don't need to be a communist to love my country. I love my country even > though I am not a communist. I love its progress. You boast that you have > won the war, and now you are the winner you want to extinguish those who you > call political opponents. I think differently from you but I love my > country. You are punishing me for my ideals! In 1964, after 18 years in the Prison of Burrel in the District of Mat region, isolated and under constant surveillance, she spent the following next 19 years of her life in internment in the town of Rr√´shen, Northern Albania, where she had to work as a streetsweeper. She was never allowed to resume her writing. She died in August 1983, in extreme poverty, after a swift battle with cancer Recognition Kokalari on a 2017 stamp of Albania Kokalari was one of the first 30 imprisoned writers to be listed in 1960 by the Committee of the Three (precursor of International PEN). In 1993 Kokalari was posthumously declared a Martyr of Democracy by the President of Albania and a school in Tirana now bears her name.

The Institute played a key role in the Human Potential Movement beginning in the 1960s. Its innovative use of encounter groups, a focus on the mind-body connection, and their ongoing experimentation in personal awareness introduced many ideas that later became mainstream. Esalen was founded by Stanford graduates Michael Murphy and Dick Price in 1962. Their intention was to support alternative methods for exploring human consciousness, what Aldous Huxley described as \\"human potentialities\\". Over the next few years, Esalen became the center of practices and beliefs that make up the New Age movement, from Eastern religions/philosophy, to alternative medicine and mind-body interventions, to Gestalt Practice. Price ran the Institute until he was killed in a hiking accident in 1985. In 2012, the board hired professional executives to help raise money and keep the Institute profitable. Until 2016, Esalen offered over 500 workshops yearly in areas including personal growth, meditation, massage, Gestalt Practice, yoga, psychology, ecology, spirituality, and organic food. in 2016, about 15,000 people attended its workshops. In February 2017, the institute was cut off when Highway 1 was closed by a mud slide on either side of the hot springs. It closed its doors, evacuated guests via helicopter, and was forced to lay off 90% of its staff through at least July, when they reopened with limited workshop offerings. It also decided to revamp its offerings to include topics more relevant to a younger generation. As of July 2017, due to the limited access resulting from the road closures, the hot springs are only open to Esalen guests.  Early history  The grounds of the Esalen Institute were first home to a Native American tribe known as the Esselen, from whom the institute adopted its name. Carbon dating tests of artifacts found on Esalen's property have indicated a human presence as early as 2600 BCE.Documentation provided by Steven Harper of radiocarbon dating, performed by members of the Sonoma State University Cultural Resources Faculty, that produced the following results: 4,630 +/- 100 years BP (before present). Harper notes confirmation by similar tests from Big Creek (4‚Äì5 miles south of Esalen Institute), which produced: 6,400 years BP, as cited in The Prehistory of Big Creek by Terry Jones (2000). The location was homesteaded by Thomas Slate on September 9, 1882, when he filed a land patent under the Homestead Act of 1862. The settlement began known as Slates Hot Springs. It was the first tourist-oriented business in Big Sur, frequented by people seeking relief from physical ailments. In 1910, the land was purchased by Henry Murphy, a Salinas, California, physician. The official business name was \\"Big Sur Hot Springs\\" although it was more generally referred to as \\"Slate's Hot Springs\\". View of the building on the bluff housing the hot springs  Founding  = Stanford grads meet = Richard Price in 1968 Michael Murphy and Dick Price both attended Stanford University in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Both had developed an interest in human psychology and earned degrees in the subject in 1952. Price was influenced by a lecture he heard Aldous Huxley give in 1960 titled \\"Human Potentialities\\". After graduating from Stanford, Price attended Harvard University to continue studying psychology. Murphy, meanwhile, traveled to Sri Aurobindo's ashram in India where he resided for several months before returning to San Francisco. They met in San Francisco at the suggestion of Frederic Spiegelberg, a Stanford professor of comparative religion and Indic studies, with whom both had studied. By then they had both dropped out of their graduate programs (Price at Harvard and Murphy at Stanford), and had served time in the military. Although they had not met until this point, their experiences were similar enough for them to begin their partnership creating Esalen. After Price was hospitalized for eighteen months he was inspired to change the way people could experience a new way to live and explore new ideas and thoughts without judgment and influence from the outside world. He was inspired by Buddhist practices, and with his own understanding of Taoism, he developed his teachings. He took what Fritz Perls had taught him and created a process that is still taught and followed today. Students all over the world follow the practices set up by Price in guidance, healing and the process and principles. = Lease property = Price and Murphy wanted to create a venue where non- traditional workshops and lecturers could present their ideas free of the dogma associated with traditional education. The two began drawing up plans for a forum that would be open to ways of thinking beyond the constraints of mainstream academia while avoiding the dogma so often seen in groups organized around a single idea promoted by a charismatic leader. They envisioned offering a wide range of philosophies, religious disciplines and psychological techniques. In 1961, they went to look at property owned by the Murphy family at Slates Hot Springs in Big Sur. It included a run-down hotel occupied in part by members of a Pentecostal church. The property was patrolled by gun- toting Hunter S. Thompson. Gay men from San Francisco filled the baths on the weekends. Henry Murphy's widow and Michael's grandmother Vinnie \\"Bunnie\\" MacDonald Murphy, who owned the property, lived away in Salinas. She had previously refused to lease the property to anyone, even turning down an earlier request from Michael. She was afraid her grandson was going to \\"give the hotel to the Hindus,\\" Murphy later said. Not long after, Thompson attempted to visit the baths with friends and got into a fistfight after antagonizing some of the gay men present. The men almost tossed him over the cliff. Murphy's father, a lawyer, finally persuaded his mother to allow her grandson to take over and she agreed to lease the property to them in 1962. The two men used capital that Price obtained from his father, who was a vice- president at Sears. They incorporated their business as a non-profit named Esalen Institute in 1963. = Develop counterculture workshops = Murphy and Price were assisted by Spiegelberg, Watts, Huxley and his wife Laura, as well as by Gerald Heard and Gregory Bateson. They modeled the concept of Esalen partially upon Trabuco College, founded by Heard as a quasi-monastic experiment in the mountains east of Irvine, California, and later donated to the Vedanta Society. Their intent was to provide \\"a forum to bring together a wide variety of approaches to enhancement of the human potential... including experiential sessions involving encounter groups, sensory awakening, gestalt awareness training, related disciplines.\\"The Aquarian Conspiracy The Mother of All Webs Who Gotcha! Gyeorgos C. Hatonn. page 211 They stated that they did not want to be viewed as a \\"cult\\" or a new church but that it was to be a center where people could explore the concepts that Price and Murphy were passionate about. The philosophy of Esalen lies in the idea that \\"the cosmos, the universe itself, the whole evolutionary unfoldment is what a lot of philosophers call slumbering spirit. The divine is incarnate in the world and is present in us and is trying to manifest,\\" according to Murphy. Alan Watts gave the first lecture at Esalen in January 1962. Gia-fu Feng joined Price and Murphy, along with Bob Breckenridge, Bob Nash, Alice and Jim Sellers, as the first Esalen staff members. In the middle of that same year Abraham Maslow, a prominent humanistic psychologist, just happened to drive into the grounds and soon became an important figure at the institute. In the fall of 1962, they published a catalog advertising workshops with such titles as \\"Individual and Cultural Definitions of Rationality,\\" \\"The Expanding Vision\\" and \\"Drug-Induced Mysticism\\". Their first seminar series in the fall of 1962 was \\"The Human Potentiality,\\" based on a lecture by Huxley. = Fritz Perls residency = In 1964, Fritz Perls began what became a five-year long residency at Esalen, leaving a lasting influence. Perls offered many Gestalt therapy seminars at the institute until he left in July 1969. Jim Simkin and Perls led Gestalt training courses at Esalen. Simkin started a Gestalt training center on property next door that was later incorporated into Esalen's main campus. When Perls left Esalen he considered it to be \\"in crisis again\\". He saw young people without any training leading encounter groups. And he feared that charlatans would take the lead. However, Grogan claims that Perls‚Äô practice at Esalen had been ethically \\"questionable\\", and according to Kripal, Perls insulted Abraham Maslow. = Gestalt Practice developed = Dick Price became one of Perls' closest students. Price managed the Institute and developed his own form he called Gestalt Practice, which he taught at Esalen until his death in a hiking accident in 1985.The Only Way Out Is In: The Life Of Richard Price Barclay James Erickson, in Michael Murphy lived in the San Francisco Bay Area and wrote non-fiction books about Esalen-related topics, as well as several novels. = Leads counterculture movement = Esalen gained popularity quickly and started to regularly publish catalogs full of programs. The facility was large enough to run multiple programs simultaneously, so Esalen created numerous resident teacher positions. Murphy recruited Will Schutz, the well- known encounter group leader, to take up permanent residence at Esalen. All this combined to firmly position Esalen in the nexus of the counterculture of the 1960s.William Irwin Thompson, \\"Going Beyond it at Big Sur\\" in At the Edge of History: Speculations on the Transformation of Culture, p. 27-66, Harper & Row (1971) The institute gained increased attention in 1966 when several magazines wrote about it. George Leonard published an article in Look magazine about the California scene which mentioned Esalen and included a picture of Murphy. Time magazine published an article about Esalen in September 1967. The New York Times Magazine published an article by Leo E. Litwak in late December. Life also published an article about the resort. These articles increased the media and the public's awareness of the institute in the U.S. and abroad. Esalen responded by holding large-scale conferences in Midwestern and East Coast cities, as well as in Europe. Esalen opened a satellite center in San Francisco that offered extensive programming until it closed in the mid-1970s for financial reasons.  Programs and management  Entrance to Esalen Institute The institute continues to offer workshops about humanistic psychology, physical wellness, and spiritual awareness. The institute has also added workshops on permaculture and ecological sustainability. Other workshops cover a wide range of subjects including arts, health, Gestalt, integral thought, martial arts, massage, dance, mythology, philosophical inquiry, somatics, spiritual and religious studies, ecopsychology, wilderness experience, yoga, tai chi, mindfulness practice, and meditation. The institute was closed for the first half of 2017 and forced to drastically reduce staff. They also decided to revamp their offerings upon reopening to include topics more relevant to a younger generation. = Center for Theory and Research = In 1998, Esalen launched the Center for Theory and Research to initiate new areas of practice and action which foster social change and realization of the human potential.Esalen Center for Theory and Research. It is the research and development arm of Esalen Institute. , Michael Cornwall, who previously worked in the Institutes' Schizophrenia Research Project at Agnews State Hospital, was conducting workshops titled the Alternative Views and Approaches to Psychosis Initiative at Esalen. He was inviting leaders in the field of psychosis treatment to attend the workshops.Alternative Views and Approaches to Psychosis, November 2012. An Esalen Center For Theory and Research Initiative at Esalen Institute. = Management changes = Esalen has been making changes to respond to internal and external factors. Dick Price was the key leader of the institute until his sudden death in a hiking accident in late 1985 brought about many changes in personnel and programming. Steven Donovan became president of the institute, and Brian Lyke served as general manager. Nancy Lunney became the director of programming, and Dick Price's son David Price served as general manager of Esalen beginning in the mid-1990s. The baths were destroyed in 1998 by severe weather and were rebuilt at great expense, but this caused severe institutional stress. Afterward, Andy Nusbaum developed an economic plan to stabilize Esalen's finances. In 2011, the Institute commissioned the company Beyond the Leading Edge to conduct a Leadership Culture Survey to assess the quality of its leadership culture. The results were negative. The survey measured how well the leadership \\"builds quality relationships, fosters teamwork, collaborates, develops people, involves people in decision making and planning, and demonstrates a high level of interpersonal skill.\\" In the \\"relating dimension\\" the survey returned a score of 18%, compared to a desired 88%. It also produced strongly dissonant scores in measures of community welfare, relating with interpersonal intelligence, clearly communicating vision, and building a sense of personal worth within the community. It ranked management as overly compliant and lacking authenticity. However, the survey found that Esalen closely matched its overall goal for customer focus. Gordon Wheeler dramatically restructured Esalen management. These changes prompted Christine Stewart Price, the widow of Dick Price, to withdraw from the institute, and found an organization named the Tribal Ground Circle with the intention to preserve Dick Price's legacy. = Early leaders and programs = Aldous Huxley In the few years after its founding, many of the seminars like \\"The Value of Psychotic Experience\\" attempted to challenge the status quo. There were even Esalen programs that questioned the movement of which Esalen itself was a part‚Äîfor instance, \\"Spiritual and Therapeutic Tyranny: The Willingness To Submit\\". There were also a series of encounter groups focused on racial prejudice. Early leaders included many well-known individuals, including Ansel Adams, Gia-fu Feng, Buckminster Fuller, Timothy Leary, Robert Nadeau, Linus Pauling, Carl Rogers, Virginia Satir, B.F. Skinner, and Arnold Toynbee. Rather than merely lecturing, many leaders experimented with what Huxley called the non-verbal humanities: the education of the body, the senses, and the emotions. Their intention was to help individuals develop awareness of their present flow of experience, to express this fully and accurately, and to listen to feedback. These \\"experiential\\" workshops were particularly well attended and were influential in shaping Esalen's future course. upright =Staff residency= Because of Esalen's isolated location, its operational staff members have lived on site from the beginning and for many years collectively contributed to the character of the institute. The community has been steeped in a form of Gestalt that pervades all aspects of daily life, including meeting structures, workplace practices, and individual language styles. There is a preschool on site called the Gazebo, serving the children of staff, some program participants, and affiliated local residents. = Scholars in residence = Esalen has sponsored long-term resident scholars, including notable individuals such as Gregory Bateson, Joseph Campbell, Stanislav Grof, Sam Keen, George Leonard, Fritz Perls, Ida Rolf, Virginia Satir, William Schutz, and Alan Watts. = Esalen Massage and Bodywork Association = Bodywork has always been a significant part of the Esalen experience. In the late 1990s, the \\"EMBA\\" was organized as a semi-autonomous Esalen association for the regulation of Esalen massage practitioners.  Past initiatives and projects  Esalen Institute has sponsored many research initiatives, educational projects, and invitational conferences. The Big Sur facility has been used for these events, as well as other locations, including international sites. = Arts events = Esalen Institute from the air in May 1972 In 1964, Joan Baez led a workshop entitled \\"The New Folk Music\\" which included a free performance. This was the first of seven \\"Big Sur Folk Festivals\\" featuring many of the era's music legends. The 1969 concert included musicians who had just come from the Woodstock Festival. This event was featured in a documentary movie, Celebration at Big Sur, which was released in 1971. John Cage and Robert Rauschenberg performed together at Esalen. Robert Bly, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Allen Ginsberg, Michael McClure, Kenneth Rexroth (who led one of the first workshops), Gary Snyder and others held poetry readings and workshops. In 1994, President and CEO Sharon Thom created an artist-in- residence program to provide artists with a two-week retreat in which to focus upon works in progress. These artists interacted with the staff, offered informal gatherings, and staged performances on the newly created dance platform. Located next to the Art Barn, the dance platform was used by Esalen teachers for dance and martial arts. The platform was later covered by a dome and renamed the Leonard Pavilion after deceased Esalen past president and board member, George Leonard. In 1995 and 1996, Esalen hosted two arts festivals which gathered together artists, poets, musicians, photographers and performers, including artist Margot McLean, psychotherapist James Hillman, guitarist Michael Hedges and Joan Baez. All staff members were allowed to attend every class and performance that did not interfere with their schedules. Arts festivals have since become a popular yearly event at Esalen. = Schizophrenia Research Project = Encouraged by Dick Price, the Schizophrenia Research Project was conducted over a three-year period at Agnews State Hospital in San Jose, California, involving 80 young males diagnosed with schizophrenia. Funded in part by Esalen Institute, this program was co-sponsored by the California Department of Mental Hygiene (reorganized: CMHSA) and the National Institute of Mental Health. It explored the thesis that the health of certain patients would permanently improve if their psychotic process was not interrupted by administration of antipsychotic pharmaceutical drugs. Julian Silverman was chief of research for the project. He also served as Esalen's general manager in the 1970s. The Agnews double blind study was the largest first-episode psychosis research project ever conducted in the United States. It demonstrated that the young men given a placebo had a 75 percent lower re-hospitalization rate and much better outcomes than the men who received anti-psychotic medication. These results were used as justification for medication-free programs in the San Francisco Bay Area. Esalen has recently begun to revive some of this interest in schizophrenia and psychosis, and hosted the R.D. Laing Symposium and workshops on compassionately responding to psychosis. = Publishing = Starting in 1969, in association with Viking Press, the institute published a series of 17 books about Esalen-related topics, including the first edition of Michael Murphy's novel, Golf in the Kingdom (1971). Some of these books remain in print. In the mid-1980s, Esalen entered into a joint publishing arrangement with Lindisfarne Press to publish a small library of Russian philosophical and theological books. = Soviet‚ÄìAmerican Exchange Program = Boris YeltsinIn 1979, Esalen began the Soviet‚ÄìAmerican Exchange Program (later renamed: Track Two, an institute for citizen diplomacy).\\"Track II (Citizen) Diplomacy\\" at The Beyond Intractability Knowledge Base Project. This initiative came at a time when Cold War tensions were at their peak. The program was credited with substantial success in fostering peaceful private exchanges between citizens of the \\"super powers\\".Track Two, An Institute For Citizen Diplomacy . In the 1980s, Michael Murphy and his wife Dulce were instrumental in organizing the program with Soviet citizen Joseph Goldin, in order to provide a vehicle for citizen-to-citizen relations between Russians and Americans. In 1982, Esalen and Goldin pioneered the first U.S.‚ÄìSoviet Space Bridge, allowing Soviet and American citizens to speak directly with one another via satellite communication. In 1988, Esalen brought Abel Aganbegyan, one of Mikhail Gorbachev's chief economic advisors, to the United States. In 1989, Esalen brought Boris Yeltsin on his first trip to the United States, although Yeltsin did not visit the Esalen facility in Big Sur. Esalen arranged meetings for Yeltsin with then President George H. W. Bush as well as many other leaders in business and government. Two former presidents of the exchange program included Jim Garrison and Jim Hickman. After Gorbachev stepped down, and effectively dissolved the Soviet Union, Garrison helped establish The State of the World Forum, with Gorbachev as its convening chairman. These successes led to other Esalen citizen diplomacy programs, including exchanges with China, an initiative to further understanding among Jews, Christians and Muslims, as well as further work on Russian-American relations.Esalen CTR: Accomplishments in Citizen Diplomacy.  Prices and finances  = 2017 closure = On February 12, 2017, a number of mud and land slides closed Highway 1 in several locations to the south and north of the hot springs and caused Esalen to partially shut down. On February 18, 2017, shifting earth damaged a pier supporting the Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge north of Esalen and forced CalTrans to close Highway 1. CalTrans determined that the bridge was damaged beyond repair and announced an accelerated project to replace the bridge by September. Following closure of the bridge, Esalen was cut off, and resorted to evacuating dozens of guests by helicopter. A landslide at Mud Creek south of the hot springs severely restricted vehicle access to the resort, and Esalen temporarily closed its doors. Then, on May 20, 2017, a new slide at Mud Creek closed Highway 1 for at least a year. On June 20, Eslalen announced that it would lay off 45 staff members through at least July, leaving only about 10 percent of its staff. Esalen partially reopened on July 28, 2017, offering limited workshops. It plans to add more seminars after the Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge reopens in September 2017. = Attendance and costs = In 2012, 600 Esalen workshops were attended by more than 12,000 people. Topics ranged from sustainable business practices to hypnosis to \\"The Holy Fool: Crazy Wisdom From Van Gogh to Tina Fey and The Big Lebowski.\\" , a weekend workshop, including the program, meals, and a place for a sleeping bag in a communal area, cost a minimum of $405 per person. A couple could rent a private room for $730 per person. Week-long workshops begin at $900 and couples are charged $1,700 per person to stay in a private room. In 2013, the Institute charges participants in its month-long, residential licensed massage practitioner training programs, $4910, including board and room. In 1987, a weekend workshop along with a single room and meals cost $270, and a five-day workshop cost $530. = Revenue and expenses = In 2013, the Institute reported revenue of $18,513,254, $13,066,407 from programs, and after expenses of $13,515,552 a net income of $4,997,702. In that year it paid CEO Patricia McEntee $152,077 In 2014, it reported total revenue of $15,934,586, expenses totalling $14,472,201, and net income of $1,462,385. McEntee was paid $157,839. The company spent nearly $10 million for renovations from 2014 to 2016, including $7.4 million to renovate the main lodge and add a cafe and bar. It also spent $1.8 million on a six-room guesthouse. There is only limited internet cellular service available, but Esalen is planning to make some of its workshops available to online participants. = Lease terms = The annual cost of its 87-year lease for the 27 acre site from the Vinnie A. Murphy Trust‚Äîwhich extends through 2049‚Äîwas $344,704 in 2014. McEntee told the Monterey County Weekly that the cost of the lease is highly discounted, and that the terms of the lease allow the trust to re-assess the lease terms in 2017. This could potentially increase the institute's rent to market value.  Past teachers  Past guest teachers include:  In popular culture  = Cultural influence = Esalen has been cited as having played a key role in the cultural transformations of the 1960s.\\"40 years later, Woodstock's spiritual vibes still resonate\\", Houston Chronicle. August 6, 2009. In its beginnings as a \\"laboratory for new thought\\", it was seen by some as the headquarters of the human potential movement. Its use of encounter groups, a focus on the mind-body connection, and their ongoing experimentation in personal awareness introduced many ideas to American society that later became mainstream. In its early years, guest lecturers and workshop leaders included many leading thinkers, psychologists, and philosophers including Erik Erikson, Ken Kesey, Alan Watts, John Lilly, Buckminster Fuller, Aldous Huxley, Linus Pauling, Fritz Perl, Joseph Campbell, Robert Bly and Carl Rogers. Esalen has also been the subject of some criticism and controversy.\\"Esalen's Identity Crisis\\", Los Angeles Times Magazine. September 5, 2004. The Economist wrote, \\"For many others in America and around the world, Esalen stands more vaguely for that metaphorical point where ‚ÄòEast meets West‚Äô and is transformed into something uniquely and mystically American or New Agey. And for a great many others yet, Esalen is simply that notorious bagno-bordello where people had sex and got high throughout the 1960s and 1970s before coming home talking psychobabble and dangling crystals.\\"Kera Abraham and Mark Anderson. \\"One Half- Century at Esalen Institute\\" . Monterey County Weekly. October 4, 2012. The Human Potential Movement was criticized for espousing an ethic that the inner- self should be freely expressed in order to reach a person's true potential. Some people saw this ethic as an aspect of Esalen's culture. The historian Christopher Lasch claimed that humanistic techniques encourage narcissistic, spiritual materialistic or self-obsessive thoughts and behaviors. In 1990 a graffiti artist spray painted \\"Jive shit for rich white folk\\" on the entrance to Esalen, highlighting class and race issues. Some thought that this was a regression of progress away from true spiritual growth. Michel Houellebecq's Atomised traces the New Age movement's influence on the novel's protagonists to older generations' chance meetings at Esalen. = Popular media = Films In the comedy-drama Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (1969), sophisticated Los Angeles residents Bob (played by Robert Culp) and Carol Sanders (Natalie Wood) spend a weekend of emotional honesty at an Esalen-style retreat, after which they return to their life determined to embrace free love and complete openness. In the film What About Bob? (1991), Bill Murray's character mentions that he hasn't felt this good since Esalen, upon his arrival at his psychiatrist's vacation home. Literature In Edward St Aubyn's comic novel On the Edge (1998), Esalen features prominently. In Thomas Pynchon's novel Inherent Vice (2009) and Paul Thomas Anderson's eponymous 2014 film adaptation, the Chryskylodon Institute is modeled after Esalen. In Norman Rush's novel Mating (1992), Esalen is referred to as a \\"twit factory.\\" Television The BBC television series, The Century of the Self (2002), is critical of the Human Potentials Movement and includes video segments recorded at Esalen. The Mad Men show finale, \\"Person to Person\\" (airdate May 17, 2015), features Don and Stephanie staying at an Esalen-like coastline retreat in the year 1970. In True Detective season 2, the Panticapaeum Institute is largely based on the Esalen Institute. In You season 1, Beck's friends tell Joe that Peach had gone to \\"Esalen\\" and Beck to a writers' retreat.

As the subject of the 2003 Plame affair, also known as the CIA leak scandal, Plame's identity as a CIA officer was leaked to and subsequently published by Robert Novak of the Washington Post. In the aftermath of the scandal, Richard Armitage in the U.S. Department of State was identified as one source of the information, and I. Lewis \\"Scooter\\" Libby, Chief of Staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, was convicted of lying to investigators. After a failed appeal, President George W.

In collaboration with a ghostwriter, Plame wrote a memoir detailing her career and the events leading up to her resignation from the CIA. She has subsequently written and published at least two spy novels. A 2010 biographical feature film, Fair Game, was produced based on memoirs by her and her husband.

(Hyperlinks in menu, including streaming video of hearing; box with \\"Documents and Links\\", featuring documents chart .) In his press conference of October 28, 2005, Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald explained the necessity of secrecy about his grand jury investigation that began in the fall of 2003 -- \\"when it was clear that Valerie Wilson's cover had been blown\\" -- and the background and consequences of the indictment of then high-ranking Bush Administration official Scooter Libby as it pertained to her. Fitzgerald's subsequent replies to reporters' questions shed further light on the parameters of the leak investigation and what, as its lead prosecutor, bound by the rules of grand jury secrecy, he could and could not reveal legally at the time. Official court documents released later, on April 5, 2006, reveal that Libby testified that \\"he was specifically authorized in advance\\" of his meeting with Judith Miller, reporter for The New York Times, to disclose the \\"key judgments\\" of the October 2002 classified National Intelligence Estimate (NIE). According to Libby's testimony, \\"the Vice President later advised him that the President had authorized defendant to disclose the relevant portions of the NIE [to Judith Miller].\\" , as posted online in The Smoking Gun (blog), April 5, 2006, accessed July 15, 2006. According to his testimony, the information that Libby was authorized to disclose to Miller \\"was intended to rebut the allegations of an administration critic, former ambassador Joseph Wilson.\\" A couple of days after Libby's meeting with Miller, then-National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice told reporters, \\"We don't want to try to get into kind of selective declassification\\" of the NIE, adding, \\"We're looking at what can be made available.\\"Michael Isikoff, \\"The Leaker in Chief?\\" Newsweek, April 4, 2006, accessed July 15, 2006. A \\"sanitized version\\" of the NIE in question was officially declassified on July 18, 2003, ten days after Libby's contact with Miller, and was presented at a White House background briefing on weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Iraq.\\"Iraq's Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction,\\" fas.org (blog), accessed July 15, 2006.

President Bush had previously indicated that he would fire whoever had outed Plame. A court filing by Libby's defense team argued that Plame was not foremost in the minds of administration officials as they sought to rebut charges ‚Äì made by her husband ‚Äì that the White House manipulated intelligence to make a case for invasion. The filing indicated that Libby's lawyers did not intend to say that he was told to reveal Plame's identity.\\"'Scooter' Won't Play Plame Blame Game\\", New York Post, April 14, 2006, accessed July 15, 2006. The court filing also stated that \\"Mr. Libby plans to demonstrate that the indictment is wrong when it suggests that he and other government officials viewed Ms. Wilson's role in sending her husband to Africa as important,\\" indicating that Libby's lawyers planned to call Karl Rove to the stand. Fitzgerald ultimately decided against pressing charges against Rove.Don Gonyea, Rove Won't Be Charged in CIA Leak Case, NPR, Morning Edition (June 13, 2006). The five-count indictment of Libby included perjury (two counts), obstruction of justice (one count), and making false statements to federal investigators (two counts). There was, however, no count for disclosing classified information, i.e., Plame's status as a CIA operative. =Libby trial= On March 6, 2007, Libby was convicted of obstruction of justice, making false statements, and two counts of perjury. He was acquitted on one count of making false statements. He was not charged for revealing Plame's CIA status. His sentence included a $250,000 fine, 30 months in prison and two years of probation. On July 2, 2007, President George W. Bush commuted Libby's sentence, removing the jail term but leaving in place the fine and probation, calling the sentence \\"excessive.\\"Grant of Executive ClemencyStatement by the President on Executive Clemency for Lewis Libby In a subsequent press conference, on July 12, 2007, Bush noted, \\"...the Scooter Libby decision was, I thought, a fair and balanced decision.\\"Press Conference by the President, July 12, 2007, accessed August 11, 2007.

Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay, Paris. The social history of the piano is the history of the instrument's role in society. The piano was invented at the end of the 17th century, had become widespread in Western society by the end of the 18th, and is still widely played today. Early years At the time of its origin around the year 1700, the piano was a speculative invention, produced by the well-paid craftsman and inventor Bartolomeo Cristofori for his wealthy patron Ferdinando de Medici, Grand Prince of Florence. As such, it was an extremely expensive item. For some time after its invention, the piano was largely owned by royalty (e.g. the kings of Portugal and Prussia); see Fortepiano for details. Even later on, (i.e. throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries), pianos were financially beyond the reach of most families, and the pianos of those times were generally the property of the gentry and the aristocracy. Visiting music masters taught their children to play the piano. Pianos and women Both ParakilasParakilas (1999, 96‚Äì109) and LoesserLoesser (1954) emphasize a connection during this period between pianos and the female gender; piano study was apparently more common for girls than boys.Wheelock (1999, 117) asserts this, basing her claim on the \\"iconography of the period\\"; i.e. surviving paintings and other images. Perhaps facetiously, she adds that this evidence \\"confirms the impression that 'historically correct' performances of solos and trios should feature women at the keyboard.\\" Despite this, women were discouraged from playing the piano professionally and were encouraged not to take their musical aspirations too seriously. Nevertheless, women were considered more attractive and desirable if they could play the piano. The piano was a symbol of social status, and the ability to play the piano stood as a testament to a woman's marriageability. Emma Wedgwood Darwin Women who had learned to play as children often continued to play as adults, thus providing music in their households.Parakilas (1999, 102) For instance, Emma Wedgwood (1808‚Äì1896), the granddaughter of the wealthy industrialist Josiah Wedgwood, took piano lessons from none other than Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, and apparently achieved a fair level of proficiency. Following her marriage to Charles Darwin, Emma still played the piano daily, while her husband listened appreciatively. A number of female piano students became outright virtuose, and the skills of woman pianists inspired the work of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, who dedicated difficult-to-play works to their woman friends.Wheelock (1999, 116) notes that with but a single exception, the dedicatees of Haydn's keyboard works were all women (the exception is the first publication authorised by his employer Nikolaus Esterh√°zy, the sonatas of 1774, which were dedicated to him). However, careers as concert musicians were typically open only to men (an important exception was Clara Schumann). The spread of the piano When the piano was invented in 1700, it failed to catch the public's attention due to its expense and the fact that the harpsichord was the preferred instrument of the time. Very few people knew of the piano until after the Seven Years' War when a young man named Johann Zumpe fled Germany for London. While there he refined Cristofori's piano, introducing separate sections of black keys as well as treble and bass capabilities. This new piano was extremely difficult to play, and very few people learned how to play the instrument because of this. That changed when Zumpe convinced Johann Christian Bach, the personal music master to Queen Charlotte and an international celebrity, to purchase and play on a Zumpe piano for the first ever Zumpe piano concert in 1768. Because of Bach's fame, the piano soon replaced the harpsichord as the predominant instrument of the time, and later composers such as Mozart and Beethoven chose to play on a Zumpe piano. Bach's fame and the interest of Queen Charlotte helped the piano become a symbol of social status. The turn of the 19th century also saw the rise of the middle class in the Western world. This middle class was eager to showcase their social status, and it became the proper Victorian man's goal to shower his wife and daughters with leisure time and leisure activities, as leisure was a symbol of social status. Consequently, the piano, which was often used for leisure, stood as a testament to a family's position on the socioeconomic ladder. Over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, the middle class of Europe and North America increased in both numbers and prosperity. This increase produced a corresponding rise in the domestic importance of the piano, as ever more families became able to afford pianos and piano instruction. The piano also became common in public institutions, such as schools, hotels, and public houses. As elements of the Western middle- class lifestyle gradually spread to other nations, the piano became common in these nations as well, for example in Japan. To understand the rise of the piano among the middle class, it is helpful to remember that before mechanical and electronic reproduction, music was in fact performed on a daily basis by ordinary people. For instance, the working people of every nation generated a body of folk music, which was transmitted orally down through the generations and sung by all. The parents of Joseph Haydn (1732‚Äì1809) could not read music, yet Haydn's father (who worked as a wheelwright) taught himself to play the harp, and the Haydn family frequently played and sang together. With rising prosperity, the many families that could now afford pianos and music adapted their home-grown musical abilities to the new instrument, and the piano became a major source of music in the home. Amateur pianists in the home often kept track of the doings of the leading pianists and composers of their day. Professional virtuosi wrote books and methods for the study of piano playing, which sold widely. The virtuosi also prepared their own editions of classical works, which included detailed marks of tempo and expression to guide the amateur who wanted to use their playing as a model. (Today, students are usually encouraged to work from an Urtext edition.) The piano compositions of the great composers often sold well among amateurs, despite the fact that, starting with Beethoven, they were often far too hard for anyone but a trained virtuoso to play well. Evidently, the amateur pianists obtained satisfaction from coming to grips with the finest music, even if they could not perform it from start to finish.This point is made in a variety of places in Loesser (1954). A favourite form of musical recreation in the home was playing works for four-hand piano, in which the two players sit side by side at a single piano. These were frequently arrangements of orchestral works, and in the days before recordings served to spread knowledge of new orchestral music to places lacking an orchestra. Sometimes members of the household would sing or play other instruments along with the piano. This practice was often a part of courtship, for performing music together‚Äîparticularly in the presence or at least earshot of other members of the household‚Äîwas one of the few \\"respectable\\" ways for a young man and young woman from \\"good\\" families to be together. Parents whose children showed unusual talent often pushed them toward professional careers, sometimes making great sacrifices to make this possible. Artur Schnabel's book My Life and MusicReprinted 1988; Mineola, NY: Dover Publications. vividly depicts his own experience along these lines, which took place in the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the late 19th century. Decline Steinway Welte-Mignon reproducing piano (1919) The piano's status in the home remained secure until technology made possible the enjoyment of music in passive form. First the player piano (c. 1900), then the home phonograph (which became common in the decade before World War I), then the radio (in the 1920s) dealt severe blows to amateur piano-playing as a form of domestic recreation. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, piano sales dropped sharply, and many manufacturers went out of business. Philco 90 \\"cathedral\\" style radio, 1931 Another blow to the piano was the widespread acceptance in the late 20th century of the electronic keyboard. This instrument, in its cheaper forms, is widely considered to provide only a poor substitute for the tonal quality of a good piano (see piano for why), but it is more easily portable, cheaper, much more flexible and in many ways better suited to the performance of popular music. Nevertheless, the piano survives to this day in many 21st-century homes. The pianos being bought today tend to be of higher quality and more expensive than those of several decades ago, suggesting perhaps that domestic piano playing may have concentrated itself in homes of wealthier or better-educated members of the middle class. It is unlikely that ability to play the piano contributes much these days to the marriageability of daughters, but many parents still feel today that piano lessons teach their children concentration and self-discipline, and open a door into the world of classical music.

The argument states that since a person not privy to revelation must either accept it or reject it based solely upon the authority of its proponent, and there is no way for a mere mortal to resolve these conflicting claims by investigation, it is prudent to reserve one's judgment. It is also argued that it is difficult to accept the existence of any one God without personal revelation. Most arguments for the existence of God are not specific to any one religion and could be applied to many religions with near equal validity. When faced with these competing claims in the absence of a personal revelation, it is argued that it is difficult to decide amongst them, to the extent that acceptance of any one religion requires a rejection of the others. Further, were a personal revelation to be granted to a nonbeliever, the same problem of confusion would develop in each new person the believer shares the revelation with. Particular examples Christians believe that Jesus is the Christian Messiah, Savior of the World and the divine Son of God; Jews and Muslims do not. Similarly, Muslims believe that the Qur'an was divinely authored, while Jews and Christians do not. There are many examples of such contrasting views, indeed, opposing fundamental beliefs (schisms) exist even within each major religion. Christianity, for example, has many subsets (denominations), which differ greatly on issues of doctrine. Hinduism, with its conception of multiple avatars being expressions of one Supreme God, is more open to the possibility that other religions might be correct for their followers, but this same principle requires the rejection of the exclusivity demanded by each of the Abrahamic religions. Additionally, faith-confirming events such as visions and miracles are reported within all faiths with regularity. A single deity associated with a single exclusive existing faith or sect would either have to have caused adherents to other faiths to have visionary or miraculous experiences which lead them to continue to reject the true faith, or at least allowed some other agency to cause these same effects. The problem does not arise in some theological models. In Deism, it is believed that there is a God, but presumed that there are no divinely caused revelations or miracles at all, leaving reports of such to have natural explanations. In some forms of Pantheism (where God is the Universe) and in Pandeism (where God has become the Universe), the appearance of many inconsistent divine revelations or miracles might simply result unintentionally from the divine nature of the Universe itself. The concept of mutual exclusivity of different religions itself (as opposed to religious pluralism) is primarily associated with Abrahamic faiths. The roots of the mutual exclusivity may be seen in the Torah, where Jews are ordered to worship the God of Israel to the exclusion of all others. Pagan religions, historically the most common forms of worship, were typically polytheistic and compatible with each other. Eastern religions are also less apt to be considered mutually exclusive, as for example in China's three teachings. Appearances The argument appears, among other places, in Voltaire's Candide and Philosophical Dictionary. It is also manifested in Denis Diderot's statement that, whatever proofs are offered for the existence of God in Christianity or any other religion, \\"an Imam can reason the same way\\".

Dunnocks have also been successfully introduced into New Zealand. It is by far the most widespread member of the accentor family, which otherwise consists of mountain species. Other common names of the dunnock include the hedge accentor, hedge sparrow, or hedge warbler. Taxonomy The dunnock was described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae. He coined the binomial name of Motacilla modularis. The specific epithet is from the Latin modularis \\"modulating\\" or \\"singing\\". This species is now placed in the genus Prunella that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Vieillot in 1816. The name \\"dunnock\\" comes from the English dun (dingy brown, dark-coloured) and the diminutive ock, and \\"accentor\\" is from post-classical Latin and means a person who sings with another. The genus name Prunella is from the German Braunelle, \\"dunnock\\", a diminutive of braun, \\"brown\\". Eight subspecies are recognised: * P. m. hebridium Meinertzhagen, R, 1934 ‚Äì Ireland and the Hebrides (west of Scotland) * P. m. occidentalis (Hartert, 1910) ‚Äì Scotland (except the Hebrides), England and west France * P. m. modularis (Linnaeus, 1758) ‚Äì north and central Europe * P. m. mabbotti Harper, 1919 ‚Äì Iberian Peninsula, southcentral France and Italy * P. m. meinertzhageni Harrison, JM & Pateff, 1937 ‚Äì Balkans * P. m. fuscata Mauersberger, 1971 ‚Äì south Crimean Peninsula (north coast of the Black Sea) * P. m. euxina Watson, 1961 ‚Äì northwest and north Turkey * P. m. obscura (Hablizl, 1783) ‚Äì northeast Turkey, Caucasus and north Iran Description A European robin-sized bird, the dunnock typically measures in length. It possesses a streaked back, somewhat resembling a small house sparrow. Like that species, the dunnock has a drab appearance which may have evolved to avoid predation. It is brownish underneath, and has a fine pointed bill. Adults have a grey head, and both sexes are similarly coloured. Unlike any similar sized small brown bird, dunnocks exhibit frequent wing flicking, especially when engaged in territorial disputes or when competing for mating rights. The main call of the dunnock is a shrill, persistent tseep along with a high trilling note, which betrays the bird's otherwise inconspicuous presence. The song is rapid, thin and tinkling, a sweet warble which can be confused with that of the Eurasian wren, but is shorter and weaker. Distribution and habitat Dunnocks are native to large areas of Eurasia, inhabiting much of Europe including Lebanon, northern Iran, and the Caucasus. They are the only commonly found accentor in lowland areas; all the others inhabit upland areas. Dunnocks were successfully introduced into New Zealand during the 19th century, and are now widely distributed around the country and some offshore islands. Favoured habitats include woodlands, shrubs, gardens, and hedgerows where they typically feed on the ground, often seeking out detritivores as food. Territoriality Dunnock singing from high perch Dunnocks are territorial and may engage in conflict with other birds that encroach upon their nests. Males sometimes share a territory and exhibit a strict dominance hierarchy. Nevertheless, this social dominance is not translated into benefits to the alpha male in terms of reproduction, since paternity is usually equally shared between males of the group. Furthermore, members of a group are rarely related, and so competition can result. Female territorial ranges are almost always exclusive. However, sometimes, multiple males will co-operate to defend a single territory containing multiple females. Males exhibit a strong dominance hierarchy within groups: older birds tend to be the dominant males and first-year birds are usually sub-dominant. Studies have found that close male relatives almost never share a territory. The male's ability to access females generally depends on female range size, which is affected by the distribution of food. When resources are distributed in dense patches, female ranges tend to be small and easy for males to monopolise. Subsequent mating systems, as discussed below, reflect high reproductive success for males and relatively lower success for females. In times of scarcity, female territories expand to accommodate the lack of resources, causing males to have a more difficult time monopolising females. Hence, females gain a reproductive advantage over males in this case. Breeding =Mating systems= Male dunnock pecking cloaca of female before matingThe dunnock possesses variable mating systems. Females are often polyandrous, breeding with two or more males at once, which is quite rare among birds. This multiple mating system leads to the development of sperm competition amongst the male suitors. DNA fingerprinting has shown that chicks within a brood often have different fathers, depending on the success of the males at monopolising the female. Males try to ensure their paternity by pecking at the cloacaAttenborough, D. 1998. p.215. The Life of Birds BBC of the female to stimulate ejection of rival males' sperm. Dunnocks take just one-tenth of a second to copulate and can mate more than 100 times a day. Males provide parental care in proportion to their mating success, so two males and a female can commonly be seen provisioning nestlings at one nest. Other mating systems also exist within dunnock populations, depending on the ratio of male to females and the overlap of territories. When only one female and one male territory overlap, monogamy is preferred. Sometimes, two or three adjacent female territories overlap one male territory, and so polygyny is favored, with the male monopolising several females. Polygynandry also exists, in which two males jointly defend a territory containing several females. Polyandry, though, is the most common mating system of dunnocks found in nature. Depending on the population, males generally have the best reproductive success in polygynous populations, while females have the advantage during polyandry. Studies have illustrated the fluidity of dunnock mating systems. When given food in abundance, female territory size is reduced drastically. Consequently, males can more easily monopolise the females. Thus, the mating system can be shifted from one that favours female success (polyandry), to one that promotes male success (monogamy, polygynandry, or polygyny). =Nest= Dunnock nest and eggsThe dunnock builds a nest (predominantly from twigs and moss and lined with soft materials such as wool or feathers), low in a bush or conifer, where adults typically lay three to five unspotted blue eggs. =Parental care and provisioning= Broods, depending on the population, can be raised by a lone female, multiple females with the part-time help of a male, multiple females with full-time help by a male, or by multiple females and multiple males. In pairs, the male and the female invest parental care at similar rates. However, in trios, the female and alpha male invest more care in chicks than does the beta male. In territories in which females are able to escape from males, both the alpha and beta males share provisioning equally. This last system represents the best case scenario for females, as it helps to ensure maximal care and the success of the young. A study has found that males tend to not discriminate between their own young and those of another male in polyandrous or polygynandrous systems. However, they do vary their feeding depending on the certainty of paternity. If a male has greater access to a female, and therefore a higher chance of a successful fertilisation, during a specific mating period, it would provide more care towards the young.

In humans they constitute 90% of epidermal skin cells. Basal cells in the basal layer (stratum basale) of the skin, are sometimes referred to as basal keratinocytes. Function The primary function of keratinocytes is the formation of a barrier against environmental damage by heat, UV radiation, water loss, pathogenic bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses. Pathogens invading the upper layers of the epidermis can cause keratinocytes to produce proinflammatory mediators, particularly chemokines such as CXCL10 and CCL2 (MCP-1) which attract monocytes, natural killer cells, T-lymphocytes, and dendritic cells to the site of pathogen invasion. Structure A number of structural proteins (filaggrin, keratin), enzymes (proteases), lipids, and antimicrobial peptides (defensins) contribute to maintain the important barrier function of the skin. Keratinization is part of the physical barrier formation (cornification), in which the keratinocytes produce more and more keratin and undergo terminal differentiation. The fully cornified keratinocytes that form the outermost layer are constantly shed off and replaced by new cells. Cell differentiation Epidermal stem cells reside in the lower part of the epidermis (stratum basale) and are attached to the basement membrane through hemidesmosomes. Epidermal stem cells divide in a random manner yielding either more stem cells or transit amplifying cells. Some of the transit amplifying cells continue to proliferate then commit to differentiate and migrate towards the surface of the epidermis. Those stem cells and their differentiated progeny are organized into columns named epidermal proliferation units. During this differentiation process, keratinocytes permanently withdraw from the cell cycle, initiate expression of epidermal differentiation markers, and move suprabasally as they become part of the stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, and eventually corneocytes in the stratum corneum. Corneocytes are keratinocytes that have completed their differentiation program and have lost their nucleus and cytoplasmic organelles. Corneocytes will eventually be shed off through desquamation as new ones come in. At each stage of differentiation, keratinocytes express specific keratins, such as keratin 1, keratin 5, keratin 10, and keratin 14, but also other markers such as involucrin, loricrin, transglutaminase, filaggrin, and caspase 14. In humans, it is estimated that keratinocytes turn over from stem cells to desquamation every 40‚Äì56 days, whereas in mice the estimated turnover time is 8‚Äì10 days. Factors promoting keratinocyte differentiation are: * A calcium gradient, with the lowest concentration in the stratum basale and increasing concentrations until the outer stratum granulosum, where it reaches its maximum. Calcium concentration in the stratum corneum is very high in part because those relatively dry cells are not able to dissolve the ions. Those elevations of extracellular calcium concentrations induces an increase in intracellular free calcium concentrations in keratinocytes. Part of that intracellular calcium increase comes from calcium released from intracellular stores and another part comes from transmembrane calcium influx, through both calcium-sensitive chloride channels and voltage-independent cation channels permeable to calcium. Moreover, it has been suggested that an extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) also contributes to the rise in intracellular calcium concentration. * Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) regulates keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation mostly by modulating calcium concentrations and regulating the expression of genes involved in keratinocyte differentiation. Keratinocytes are the only cells in the body with the entire vitamin D metabolic pathway from vitamin D production to catabolism and vitamin D receptor expression. * Cathepsin E. * TALE homeodomain transcription factors. * Hydrocortisone. Since keratinocyte differentiation inhibits keratinocyte proliferation, factors that promote keratinocyte proliferation should be considered as preventing differentiation. These factors include: * The transcription factor p63, which prevents epidermal stem cells from differentiating into keratinocytes. * Vitamin A and its analogues. * Epidermal growth factor. * Transforming growth factor alpha. * Cholera toxin. Interaction with other cells Within the epidermis keratinocytes are associated with other cell types such as melanocytes and Langerhans cells. Keratinocytes form tight junctions with the nerves of the skin and hold the Langerhans cells and intra-dermal lymphocytes in position within the epidermis. Keratinocytes also modulate the immune system: apart from the above-mentioned antimicrobial peptides and chemokines they are also potent producers of anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10 and TGF-Œ≤. When activated, they can stimulate cutaneous inflammation and Langerhans cell activation via TNFŒ± and IL-1Œ≤ secretion. Keratinocytes contribute to protecting the body from ultraviolet radiation (UVR) by taking up melanosomes, vesicles containing the endogenous photoprotectant melanin, from epidermal melanocytes. Each melanocyte in the epidermis has several dendrites that stretch out to connect it with many keratinocytes. The melanin is then stored within keratinocytes and melanocytes in the perinuclear area as supranuclear ‚Äúcaps‚Äù, where it protects the DNA from UVR-induced damage. Role in wound healing Wounds to the skin will be repaired in part by the migration of keratinocytes to fill in the gap created by the wound. The first set of keratinocytes to participate in that repair come from the bulge region of the hair follicle and will only survive transiently. Within the healed epidermis they will be replaced by keratinocytes originating from the epidermis. At the opposite, epidermal keratinocytes, can contribute to de novo hair follicle formation during the healing of large wounds. Functional keratinocytes are needed for tympanic perforation healing.Y Shen, Y Guo, C Du, M Wilczynska, S Hellstr√∂m, T Ny, Mice Deficient in Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator Have Delayed Healing of Tympanic Membrane Perforations, PLOS ONE, 2012 Sunburn cells A sunburn cell is a keratinocyte with a pyknotic nucleus and eosinophilic cytoplasm that appears after exposure to UVC or UVB radiation or UVA in the presence of psoralens. It shows premature and abnormal keratinization, and has been described as an example of apoptosis. Aging With age, tissue homeostasis declines partly because stem/progenitor cells fail to self-renew or differentiate. DNA damage caused by exposure of stem/progenitor cells to reactive oxygen species (ROS) may play a key role in epidermal stem cell aging. Mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2) ordinarily protects against ROS. Loss of SOD2 in mouse epidermal cells was observed to cause cellular senescence that irreversibly arrested proliferation in a fraction of keratinocytes. In older mice, SOD2 deficiency delayed wound closure and reduced epidermal thickness. Civatte body Civatte body A Civatte body (named after the French dermatologist Achille Civatte, 1877‚Äì1956) is a damaged basal keratinocyte that has undergone apoptosis, and consist largely of keratin intermediate filaments, and are almost invariably covered with immunoglobulins, mainly IgM. Civatte bodies are characteristically found in skin lesions of various dermatoses, particularly lichen planus and discoid lupus erythematosus. They may also be found in graft-versus-host disease, adverse drug reactions, inflammatory keratosis (such as lichenoid actinic keratosis and lichen planus-like keratosis), erythema multiforme, bullous pemphigoid, eczema, lichen planopilaris, febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, herpes simplex and varicella zoster lesions, dermatitis herpetiformis, porphyria cutanea tarda, sarcoidosis, subcorneal pustular dermatosis, transient acantholytic dermatosis and epidermolytic hyperkeratosis.

The epidermis layer provides a barrier to infection from environmental pathogens and regulates the amount of water released from the body into the atmosphere through transepidermal water loss. The epidermis is composed of multiple layers of flattened cells that overlie a base layer (stratum basale) composed of columnar cells arranged perpendicularly. The rows of cells develop from stem cells in the basal layer. Cellular mechanisms for regulating water and sodium levels (ENaCs) are found in all layers of the epidermis. The word epidermis is derived through Latin , itself and . Something related to or part of the epidermis is termed epidermal. The human epidermis is a familiar example of epithelium, particularly a stratified squamous epithelium.  Structure  =Cellular components= The epidermis primarily consists of keratinocytes (proliferating basal and differentiated suprabasal), which comprise 90% of its cells, but also contains melanocytes, Langerhans cells, Merkel cells, and inflammatory cells. Epidermal thickenings called Rete ridges (or rete pegs) extend downward between dermal papillae.TheFreeDictionary > rete ridge Citing: The American Heritage Medical Dictionary Copyright 2007, 2004 Blood capillaries are found beneath the epidermis, and are linked to an arteriole and a venule. The epidermis itself has no blood supply and is nourished almost exclusively by diffused oxygen from the surrounding air. =Cell junctions= Epidermal cells are tightly interconnected to serve as a tight barrier against the exterior environment. The junctions between the epidermal cells are of the adherens junction type, formed by transmembrane proteins called cadherins. Inside the cell, the cadherins are linked to actin filaments. In immunofluorescence microscopy, the actin filament network appears as a thick border surrounding the cells, although the actin filaments are actually located inside the cell and run parallel to the cell membrane. Because of the proximity of the neighboring cells and tightness of the junctions, the actin immunofluorescence appears as a border between cells. =Layers= Schematic image showing a section of epidermis, with epidermal layers labeled The epidermis is composed of 4 or 5 layers, depending on the region of skin being considered.The Ageing Skin - Structure Those layers in descending order are: * cornified layer (stratum corneum) Confocal image of the stratum corneum ::Composed of 10 to 30 layers of polyhedral, anucleated corneocytes (final step of keratinocyte differentiation), with the palms and soles having the most layers. Corneocytes contain a protein envelope (cornified envelope proteins) underneath the plasma membrane, are filled with water-retaining keratin proteins, attached together through corneodesmosomes and surrounded in the extracellular space by stacked layers of lipids. Most of the barrier functions of the epidermis localize to this layer. * clear/translucent layer (stratum lucidum, only in palms and soles) ::This narrow layer is found only on the palms and soles. The epidermis of these two areas is known as \\"thick skin\\" because with this extra layer, the skin has 5 epidermal layers instead of 4. * granular layer (stratum granulosum) Confocal image of the stratum granulosum ::Keratinocytes lose their nuclei and their cytoplasm appears granular. Lipids, contained into those keratinocytes within lamellar bodies, are released into the extracellular space through exocytosis to form a lipid barrier. Those polar lipids are then converted into non-polar lipids and arranged parallel to the cell surface. For example glycosphingolipids become ceramides and phospholipids become free fatty acids. * spinous layer (stratum spinosum) Confocal image of the stratum spinosum already showing some clusters of basal cells ::Keratinocytes become connected through desmosomes and produce lamellar bodies, from within the Golgi, enriched in polar lipids, glycosphingolipids, free sterols, phospholipids and catabolic enzymes.

Confocal image of the stratum basale already showing some papillae ::Composed mainly of proliferating and non-proliferating keratinocytes, attached to the basement membrane by hemidesmosomes. Melanocytes are present, connected to numerous keratinocytes in this and other strata through dendrites. Merkel cells are also found in the stratum basale with large numbers in touch-sensitive sites such as the fingertips and lips. They are closely associated with cutaneous nerves and seem to be involved in light touch sensation. The Malpighian layer (stratum malpighi) is both the stratum basale and stratum spinosum. The epidermis is separated from the dermis, its underlying tissue, by a basement membrane. =Cellular kinetics= Cell division As a stratified squamous epithelium, the epidermis is maintained by cell division within the stratum basale. Differentiating cells delaminate from the basement membrane and are displaced outward through the epidermal layers, undergoing multiple stages of differentiation until, in the stratum corneum, losing their nucleus and fusing to squamous sheets, which are eventually shed from the surface (desquamation). Differentiated keratinocytes secrete keratin proteins, which contribute to the formation of an extracellular matrix that is an integral part of the skin barrier function. In normal skin, the rate of keratinocyte production equals the rate of loss, taking about two weeks for a cell to journey from the stratum basale to the top of the stratum granulosum, and an additional four weeks to cross the stratum corneum. The entire epidermis is replaced by new cell growth over a period of about 48 days. Calcium concentration Keratinocyte differentiation throughout the epidermis is in part mediated by a calcium gradient, increasing from the stratum basale until the outer stratum granulosum, where it reaches its maximum, and decreasing in the stratum corneum. Calcium concentration in the stratum corneum is very low in part because those relatively dry cells are not able to dissolve the ions. This calcium gradient parallels keratinocyte differentiation and as such is considered a key regulator in the formation of the epidermal layers. Elevation of extracellular calcium concentrations induces an increase in intracellular free calcium concentrations. Part of that intracellular increase comes from calcium released from intracellular stores and another part comes from transmembrane calcium influx, through both calcium-sensitive chloride channels and voltage-independent cation channels permeable to calcium. Moreover, it has been suggested that an extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) also contributes to the rise in intracellular calcium concentration. =Development= Epidermal organogenesis, the formation of the epidermis, begins in the cells covering the embryo after neurulation, the formation of the central nervous system. In most vertebrates, this original one-layered structure quickly transforms into a two-layered tissue; a temporary outer layer, the periderm, which is disposed once the inner basal layer or stratum germinativum has formed. This inner layer is a germinal epithelium that gives rise to all epidermal cells. It divides to form the outer spinous layer (stratum spinosum). The cells of these two layers, together called the Malpighian layer(s) after Marcello Malpighi, divide to form the superficial granular layer (Stratum granulosum) of the epidermis. The cells in the stratum granulosum do not divide, but instead form skin cells called keratinocytes from the granules of keratin. These skin cells finally become the cornified layer (stratum corneum), the outermost epidermal layer, where the cells become flattened sacks with their nuclei located at one end of the cell. After birth these outermost cells are replaced by new cells from the stratum granulosum and throughout life they are shed at a rate of 0.001 - 0.003 ounces of skin flakes every hour, or 0.024-0.072 ounces per day. Epidermal development is a product of several growth factors, two of which are: * Transforming growth factor Alpha (TGFŒ±) is an autocrine growth factor by which basal cells stimulate their own division. * Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF or FGF7) is a paracrine growth factor produced by the underlying dermal fibroblasts in which the proliferation of basal cells is regulated. Function =Barrier= The epidermis serves as a barrier to protect the body against microbial pathogens, oxidant stress (UV light), and chemical compounds, and provides mechanical resistance to minor injury. Most of this barrier role is played by the stratum corneum. ;Characteristics * Physical barrier: Epidermal keratinocytes are tightly linked by cell‚Äìcell junctions associated to cytoskeletal proteins, giving the epidermis its mechanical strength. * Chemical barrier: Highly organized lipids, acids, hydrolytic enzymes, and antimicrobial peptides inhibit passage of external chemicals and pathogens into the body. * Immunologically active barrier: The humoral and cellular constituents of the immune system found in the epidermis actively combat infection. * Water content of the stratum corneum drops towards the surface, creating hostile conditions for pathogenic microorganism growth. * An acidic pH (around 5.0) and low amounts of water make the epidermis hostile to many microorganic pathogens. * Non-pathogenic microorganisms on the surface of the epidermis help defend against pathogens by competing for food, limiting its availability, and producing chemical secretions that inhibit the growth of pathogenic microbiota. ;Permeability * Psychological stress, through an increase in glucocorticoids, compromises the stratum corneum and thus the barrier function. * Sudden and large shifts in humidity alter stratum corneum hydration in a way that could allow entry of pathogenic microorganisms. =Skin hydration= The ability of the skin to hold water is primarily due to the stratum corneum and is critical for maintaining healthy skin. Skin hydration is quantified using corneometry.C. W. Blichmann, J. Serup: Assessment of Skin Moisture, Acta Derm. Venereol. (Stockli) 1988; 68: 284‚Äì290 Lipids arranged through a gradient and in an organized manner between the cells of the stratum corneum form a barrier to transepidermal water loss. =Skin color= The amount and distribution of melanin pigment in the epidermis is the main reason for variation in skin color in Homo sapiens. Melanin is found in the small melanosomes, particles formed in melanocytes from where they are transferred to the surrounding keratinocytes. The size, number, and arrangement of the melanosomes vary between racial groups, but while the number of melanocytes can vary between different body regions, their numbers remain the same in individual body regions in all human beings. In white and Asian skin the melanosomes are packed in \\"aggregates\\", but in black skin they are larger and distributed more evenly. The number of melanosomes in the keratinocytes increases with UV radiation exposure, while their distribution remain largely unaffected. Clinical significance Laboratory culture of keratinocytes to form a 3D structure (artificial skin) recapitulating most of the properties of the epidermis is routinely used as a tool for drug development and testing. =Hyperplasia= Epidermal hyperplasia (thickening resulting from cell proliferation) has various forms: *Acanthosis is diffuse epidermal hyperplasia (thickening of the skin, and not to be confused with acanthocytes).Kumar, Vinay; Fausto, Nelso; Abbas, Abul (2004) Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease (7th ed.). Saunders. Page 1230. . It implies increased thickness of the Malpighian layer (stratum basale and stratum spinosum). Acanthosis nigricans is a black, poorly defined, velvety hyperpigmented acanthosis, usually observed in the back of neck, axilla, and other folded regions of the skin. *Focal epithelial hyperplasia (Heck's disease) is an asymptomatic, benign neoplastic condition characterized by multiple white to pinkish papules that occur diffusely in the oral cavity.. *Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia (PEH) is a benign condition characterized by hyperplasia of the epidermis and epithelium of skin appendages, with irregular squamous strands extending down into the dermis, and closely simulating squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

He led a modernist revolution in the second half of the 20th century, \\"exerting a seismic influence\\" on Arabic poetry comparable to T.S. Eliot's in the anglophone world. Adonis's publications include twenty volumes of poetry and thirteen of criticism. His dozen books of translation to Arabic include the poetry of Saint-John Perse and Yves Bonnefoy, and the first complete Arabic translation of Ovid's \\"Metamorphoses\\" (2002). His multi-volume anthology of Arabic poetry (\\"Dƒ´wƒÅn ash-shi'r al-'arabƒ´\\"), covering almost two millennia of verse, has been in print since its publication in 1964. A perennial contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, Adonis has been described as the greatest living poet of the Arab world. Biography =Early life and education= Born to a modest Alawite farming family in January 1930, Adonis hails from the village of al-Qassabin near the city of Latakia in western Syria. He was unable to afford formal schooling for most of his childhood, and his early education consisted of learning the Quran in the local kuttab (mosque-affiliated school) and memorizing classical Arabic poetry, to which his father had introduced him. In 1944, despite the animosity of the village chief and his father's reluctance, the young poet managed to recite one of his poems before Shukri al-Quwatli, the president of the newly- established Republic of Syria, who was on a visit to al-Qassabin. After admiring the boy's verses, al-Quwatli asked him if there were anything he needed help with. \\"I want to go to school,\\" responded the young poet, and his wish was soon fulfilled in the form of a scholarship to the French lyc√©e at Tartus. The school, the last French Lyc√©e school in Syria at the time, was closed in 1945, and Adonis was transferred to other national schools before graduating in 1949. He was a good student, and managed to secure a government scholarship. In 1950 Adonis published his first collection of verse, Dalila, as he joined the Syrian University (now Damascus University) to study law and philosophy, graduating in 1954 with a BA in philosophy. He later earned a doctoral degree in Arabic literature in 1973 from Saint Joseph University. While serving in the military in 1955‚Äì56, Adonis was imprisoned for his membership in the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (following the assassination of Adnan al-Malki), Led by Antoun Saadeh, the SSNP had opposed European colonization of Greater Syria and its partition into smaller nations. The party advocated a secular, national (not strictly Arab) approach toward transforming Greater Syria into a progressive society governed by consensus and providing equal rights to all, regardless of ethnicity or sect. =Name= The name \\"Adonis\\" (pronounced ah-doh-NEES) was picked up by Adonis himself at age 17, after being rejected by a number of magazines under his real name, to \\"alert napping editors to his precocious talent and his pre-Islamic, pan- Mediterranean muses\\". =Personal life= Adonis was married in 1956 to literary critic Khalida Said (n√©e Saleh), who assisted in editing roles in both Shi ør and Mawaqif. They have two daughters: Arwad, who is director of the House of World Cultures in Paris; and Ninar, an artist who moves between Paris and Beirut. Adonis has lived in Paris, France, since 1975. In his book Identit√© Inachev√©e he expresses opposition to \\"religion as an institution imposed on the whole of society\\" but support of individual religious freedom. He describes himself as a \\"pagan mystic\\", elaborating: =Beirut and Paris= In 1956, Adonis fled Syria for Beirut, Lebanon. He joined a vibrant community of artists, writers, and exiles; Adonis settled abroad and has made his career largely in Lebanon and France, where in 1957 he founded the magazine Majallat Shi ør (\\"Poetry Magazine\\") that met with strong criticism as they published experimental poetry, and was arguably the most influential Arab literary journal everMoreh, Shmuel. Modern Arabic Poetry 1800‚Äì1970: The Development of its Forms and Themes under the Influence of Western Literature. Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1976: 278‚Äì280; 285; 288. Majallat Shi ør ceased publication in 1964, and Adonis did not rejoin the Shi ør editors when they resumed publication in 1967. In Lebanon, his intense nationalistic feelings, reflecting pan-Arabism focused on the Arab peoples as a nation, found their outlet in the Beirut newspaper Lisan al-Hal and eventually in his founding of another literary periodical in 1968 titled MawƒÅqif, in which he again published experimental poetry.Snir, Reuven. Mysticism and Poetry in Arabic Literature. Orientalia Suecana XLIII- XLIV (1994‚Äì5) 165‚Äì175. V. Sufi Terms in the Service of Social Values, 171-3. Adonis's poems continued to express his nationalistic views combined with his mystical outlook. With his use of Sufi terms (the technical meanings of which were implied rather than explicit), Adonis became a leading exponent of the Neo-Sufi trend in modern Arabic poetry. This trend took hold in the 1970s.Butt, Aviva. \\"Adonis, Mysticism and the Neo-Sufi Trend\\" in Poets from a War Torn World. SBPRA, 2012: pp. 2‚Äì7. Adonis received a scholarship to study in Paris from 1960‚Äì61. From 1970-85 he was professor of Arabic literature at the Lebanese University. In 1976, he was a visiting professor at the University of Damascus. In 1980, he emigrated to Paris to escape the Lebanese Civil War. In 1980‚Äì81, he was professor of Arabic in Paris. From 1970 to 1985 he taught Arabic literature at the Lebanese University; he also has taught at the University of Damascus, Sorbonne (Paris III), and, in the United States, at Georgetown and Princeton universities. In 1985 he moved with his wife and two daughters to Paris, which has remained their primary residence. While temporally in Syria, Adonis helped in editing the cultural supplement of the newspaper Al-Thawra but pro government writers clashed with his agenda and forced him to flee the country. Editorship =Majallat Shi ør= Adonis joined ranks with Syro-Lebanese poet Yusuf al-Khal in editing Majallat Shi ør (English: \\"Poetry Magazine\\"), a modernist Arabic poetry magazine, which Al- Khal established in 1957. His name appeared as editor from the magazine's fourth edition. By 1962 the magazine appeared with both Adonis and Al-Khal's names side by side as \\"Owners and Editors in Chief\\". While at Shi ør, Adonis played an important role in the evolution of free verse in Arabic. Adonis and al-Khal asserted that modern verse needed to go beyond the experimentation of \\"al-shi ør al-hadith\\" (modern, or free, verse), which had appeared nearly two decades earlier. Also responding to a growing mandate that poetry and literature be committed to the immediate political needs of the Arab nation and the masses, Adonis and Shi ør energetically opposed the recruitment of poets and writers into propagandist efforts. In rejecting \\"al- æadab al- iltizƒÅm\\" ('politically committed literature'), Adonis was opposing the suppression of the individual's imagination and voice for the needs of the group. Poetry, he argued, must remain a realm in which language and ideas are examined, reshaped, and refined, in which the poet refuses to descend to the level of daily expediencies. Shi ør was published for ten years and was arguably the most influential Arab literary journal ever; it was recognized as the main platform and prime mover for the modernism movement in Arabic literature, it featured and helped bring to light poets such as Ounsi el-Hajj, Saadi Yousef and many others. =Mawaqif= Adonis later started another poetry magazine, titled Mawaqif (English: \\"Positions\\"); the magazine was first published in 1968, considered a significant literary and cultural quarterly. Adonis wanted in Mawqaif to enlarge the focus of Shi ør by addressing the politics and the illusions of the Arab nations after their defeat in the Six- Day War, believing that literature by itself cannot achieve the renewal of society and that it should be related to a more comprehensive revolutionary movement of renovation on all levels. A number of literary figures later joined and contributed to Mawaqif, including Elias Khoury, Hisham Sharabi and Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish among others. Due to its revolutionary nature and free-thinking outlook, Mawaqif had to overcome some problems, including censorship by governments less open than Lebanon's, financial difficulties that its independent nature entailed, and the problems that came in the wake of the Lebanese War. However, in spite of these difficulties, it continued to be in print until 1994.Ahmad Sa'id to Adonis: A Study of Adonis's Controversial Position on Arab Cultural Heritage =Al-Akhar= Adonis also founded and edited Al-Akhar (English: \\"The Other\\"), a magazine dedicated to publishing original content as well as numerous literary translations of contemporary essays on philosophy and Arabism. The magazine published myriad essays on contemporary Arab thought and interrogated the relationship between political and religious thought. It expressed concern with structural impediments to the spreading of progress and freedom in the Arab world, and included writers such as Ahmed Barqawi and Mustafa Safwan. The magazine was published in Beirut from 2011 to 2013. The magazine contained essays and was published by the Syrian businessman Hares Youssef. Poetry =\\"The Songs of Mihyar of Damascus\\"= Published in 1961, this is Adonis's third book of poetry, \\"The Songs of Mihyar of Damascus\\" (or the Damascene in different translation) marked a definitive disruption of existing poetics and a new direction in poetic language. In a sequence of 141 mostly short lyrics arranged in seven sections (the first six sections begin with 'psalms' and the final section is a series of seven short elegies) the poet transposes an icon of the early eleventh century, Mihyar of Daylam (in Iran), to contemporary Damascus in a series, or vortex, of non-narrative 'fragments' that place character deep \\"in the machinery of language\\", and he wrenches lyric free of the 'I' while leaving individual choice intact. The whole book has been translated by Adnan Haydar and Michael Beard as Mihyar of Damascus: His Songs (BOA Editions, NY 2008) Some of the poems included in this collection: * \\"Psalm\\" * \\"Not a Star\\" * \\"King Mihyar\\" * \\"His Voice\\" * \\"An Invitation to Death\\" * \\"New Covenant\\" * \\"The End of the Sky\\" * \\"He Carries in His Eyes\\" * \\"Voice\\" * \\"The Wound\\" And other poems. the collection been claimed to have \\"reshaped the possibilities of Arabic lyric poetry\\".\\"(Mihyar of Damascus, his Songs), a 1961 collection which famously reshaped the possibilities of Arabic lyric poetry\\". \\"guernicamag\\". December 2, 2007. =\\"A Time Between Ashes and Roses\\"= In 1970 Adonis published \\"A Time Between Ashes and Roses\\" as a volume consisting of two long poems 'An Introduction to the History of the Petty Kings' and 'This Is My Name' and in the 1972 edition augmented them with 'A Grave For New York.' These three astonishing poems, written out of the crises in Arabic society and culture following the disastrous 1967 Six-Day War and as a stunning decrepitude against intellectual aridity, opened out a new path for contemporary poetry. The whole book, in its augmented 1972 edition has a complete English translation by Shawkat M. Toorawa as A Time Between Ashes and Roses (Syracuse University Press 2004). =\\"This Is My Name\\" (book)= Written in 1969, the poem was first published in 1970 with only two long poems, then reissued two years later with an additional poem (\\"A Grave for New York\\"), in \\"A Time Between Ashes and Roses\\" collection of poems. In the poem, Adonis, spurred by the Arabs' shock and bewilderment after the Six- Day War, renders a claustrophobic yet seemingly infinite apocalypse. Adonis is hard at work undermining the social discourse that has turned catastrophe into a firmer bond with dogma and cynical defeatism throughout the Arab world. To mark this ubiquitous malaise, the poet attempts to find a language that matches it, and he fashions a vocal arrangement that swerves and beguiles. The poem was the subject of wide study in the Arab literary community due to its mysterious rhythmic regime and its influence on the poetry movement in the 1960s and 70s after its publication.,(ÿ£ÿØŸàŸÜŸäÿ≥.. ÿßÿ≥ŸÖŸá ŸÑÿ∫ŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ∂ÿßÿ±ÿ© ‚Äì Translation from Arabic: Adonis .. his name is a culture mine\\".

The poem was published by Actes Sud in 1986, nearly two decades before it appeared in English, and depicts the desolation of New York City as emblematic of empire, described as a violently anti-American, in the poem Walt Whitman the known American poet, as the champion of democracy, is taken to task, particularly in Section 9, which addresses Whitman directly. Adonis wrote the poem in spring 1971 after a visit to the United States. Unlike his poem \\"The Desert\\", where Adonis presented the pain of war and siege without naming and anchoring the context, in this poem he refers explicitly to a multitude of historical figures and geographical locations. He pits poets against politicians, the righteous against the exploitative. The English translation of this long poem from Arabic skips some short passages of the original (indicated by ellipses), but the overall effect remains intact. The poem is made up of 10 sections, each denouncing New York City in a different way. It opens by presenting the beastly nature of the city and by satirizing the Statue of Liberty. \\"A Grave for New York\\" is an obvious example of Adonis's larger project of reversing the Orientalist paradigm to re-claim what he terms 'eastern' values as positive.Michelle Hartman: A Grave for New York and New York 80: Formulating an Arab Identity through the Lens of New York, Institute of Islamic Studies, McGill University, Montreal, Canada = \\"Al-Kitab\\" (book)= Arabic for \\"The Book\\", Adonis worked on this book, a three-volume epic that adds up to almost two thousand pages, from 1995 to 2003. In \\"Al-Kitab\\", the poet travels on land and through the history and politics of Arab societies, beginning immediately after the death of the prophet Muhammad and progressing through the ninth century, which he considers the most significant period of Arab history, an epoch to which he repeatedly alludes. Al-Kitab provides a large lyric-mural rather than an epic that attempts to render the political, cultural, and religious complexity of almost fifteen centuries of Arab civilization. The book was translated to French by Houria Abdelouahed and published in 2013. =\\"Adonis: Selected Poems\\" (book)= Translated from Arabic by Khaled Mattawa and described as \\"a genuine overview of the span of Adonis's\\", the book is the inclusion of a number of poems of between five and fifteen or so pages in length. The book included selected poems from the following poem collections: * \\"First Poems (1957)\\" * \\"Songs of Mihyar of Damascus (1961)\\" * \\"Migrations and Transformations in the Regions of Night and Day (1965)\\" * \\"Stage and Mirrors (1968)\\" * \\"A Time Between Ashes and Roses (1971)\\" * \\"Singular in a Plural Form (1975)\\" * \\"The Book of Similarities and Beginnings (1980)\\" * \\"The Book of Siege (1985)\\" * \\"Desire Moving Through Maps of Matter (1987)\\" * \\"Celebrating Vague-Clear Things (1988)\\" * \\"Another Alphabet (1994)\\" * \\"Prophesy, O Blind One (2003)\\" * \\"Beginnings of the Body, Ends of the Sea (2003)\\" * \\"Printer of the Planets' Books (2008)\\" ; Book awards In 2011, Khaled Mattawa translation of \\"Adonis: Selected Poems\\" by Adonis was Selected as a finalist for the 2011 Griffin Poetry Prize sponsored by the Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry In the same year (2011) translation of the book \\"Selected Poems by Adonis\\" won the Saif Ghobash-Banipal Prize for Arabic Literary Translation in which the Judges deemed it \\"Destined to become a classic\\" Literary criticism Adonis is often portrayed as entirely dismissive of the intellectual heritage of Arabic culture. Yet in al-ThƒÅbit wa-l-Muta·∏•awwil (The Immutable and the Transformative), his emphasis on the plurality of Arabic heritage posits the richness of Arabic Islamic heritage and the deficiency of tradition as defined by imitation (taqlƒ´d). He views culture as dynamic rather than immutable and transcendent, challenging the traditionalist homogenizing tendency within heritage. In studying the Arabic cultural system, Adonis emphasizes that the concept of heritage construed as a unified repertoire based on a consistent cultural essence preconditions the rupture between this heritage and modernity. Adonis's critique of Arab culture did not merely call for the adoption of Western values, paradigms, and lifestyles per Science, which has evolved greatly in Western societies, with its \\"intuitions and practical results,\\" should be acknowledged as the \\"most revolutionary development in the history of mankind\\" argues Adonis. The truths that science offers \\"are not like those of philosophy or of the arts. They are truths which everyone must of necessity accept, because they are proven in theory and practice.\\" But science is guided by dynamics that make it insufficient as an instrument for human fulfillment and meaning: science's reliance on transcending the past to achieve greater progress is not applicable to all facets of human activity. \\"What does progress mean in poetry?\\" asks Adonis. \\"Nothing.\\" Progress in the scientific sense pursues the apprehension of phenomenon, seeking uniformity, predictability, and repeatability. As such, the idea of progress in science is \\"quite separate from artistic achievement.\\" Poetry and the other arts seek a kind of progress that affirms difference, elation, movement, and variety in life. =\\"The Static and the Dynamic\\" (book)= In Arabic \\"Al-Thabit wa al- mutahawwil\\", the book full title is \\"The Static and the Dynamic: A Research into the Creative and the Imitative of Arabs\\", it was first published in 1973 till 1978 (still in print in Arabic, now in 8th edition) by Dar al-Saqi, the book is a four-volume study described in the under title as \\"a study of creativity and adheration in Arabs), Adonis started original writings on the project as a PhD dissertation while in Saint Joseph University, in this study, still the subject of intellectual and literature controversy,:ar:ÿßŸÑÿ´ÿßÿ®ÿ™ ŸàÿßŸÑŸÖÿ™ÿ≠ŸàŸÑ (ŸÉÿ™ÿßÿ®) Adonis offers his analysis of Arabic literature, he theorizes that two main streams have operated within Arabic poetry, a conservative one and an innovative one. The history of Arabic poetry, he argues, has been that of the conservative vision of literature and society (al-thabit), quelling poetic experimentation and philosophical and religious ideas (al-mutahawil). Al-thabit, or static current, manifests itself in the triumph of naql (conveyance) over 'aql (original, independent thought); in the attempt to make literature a servant of religion; and in the reverence accorded to the past whereby language and poetics were essentially Quranic in their source and therefore not subject to change. Adonis devoted much attention to the question of \\"the modern\\" in Arabic literature and society, he surveyed the entire Arabic literary tradition and concludes that, like the literary works themselves, attitudes to and analyses of them must be subject to a continuing process of reevaluation. Yet what he actually sees occurring within the critical domain is mostly static and unmoving. The second concern, that of particularity (khu·π£≈´·π£iyyah), is a telling reflection of the realization among writers and critics throughout the Arabic-speaking world that the region they inhabited was both vast and variegated (with Europe to the north and west as a living example). Debate over this issue, while acknowledging notions of some sense of Arab unity, revealed the need for each nation and region to investigate the cultural demands of the present in more local and particular terms. A deeper knowledge of the relationship between the local present and its own unique version of the past promises to furnish a sense of identity and particularity that, when combined with similar entities from other Arabic- speaking regions, will illustrate the immensely rich and diverse tradition of which 21st-century litterateurs are the heirs. =\\"An Introduction to Arab Poetics\\" (book)= First published in January 1991, in this book, Adonis examines the oral tradition of the pre-Islamic poetry of Arabia and the relationship between Arabic poetry and the Quran, and between poetry and thought. He also assesses the challenges of modernism and the impact of western culture on the Arab poetic tradition. Artwork Adonis started making images using calligraphy, color and figurative gestures around the year 2002, in 2012 A major tribute to Adonis, including an exhibition of his drawings and a series of literary events was organized in The Mosaic Rooms in West London. On 19 May 2014 Salwa Zeidan Gallery in Abu Dhabi, was home to another noted exhibition by Adonis: Muallaqat (in reference to the original pre-Islamic era literary works Mu'allaqat), consisted of 10 calligraphy drawings of big format (150x50cm). =Other art exhibitions= * 2000: Berlin ‚Äì Institute for Advanced Studies * 2000: Paris ‚Äì L\`Institut du Monde Arabe * 2003: Paris ‚Äì Area Gallery * 2007: Amman -Shuman\`s Gallery (co-exhibition With Haydar) * 2008: Damascus ‚Äì Atassy Gallery, exh.

His expulsion generated bitter debate among writers and artists across the Middle East. Two of Syria's leading writers, Saadallah Wannous and Hanna Mina, resigned from the union in solidarity with Adonis. =Death threats= A known critic of Islamic religious values and traditions, who describes himself as a non-religious person, Adonis has previously received a number of death threats via Fatwa by known Egyptian Salafi sheikh Mohamad Said Raslan who accused him of leaving his Muslim name (Ali) and taking a pagan name, in a circulated video he accused him of as well as being a warrior against Islam and demanded his books to be banned describing him as a thing and an infidel. In May 2012, a statement issued on one of the Syrian opposition's Facebook pages, supporters of the Syrian opposition argued that the literary icon deserved to die on three counts. First, he is Alawite. Second he is also opposed to the Muslim religion. Third, he criticizes the opposition and rejects foreign military intervention in Syria. In May 2012, a group of Lebanese and Syrian intellectuals issued an online condemnation in the wake of the call. =Call for book burning= In 2013, Islamic scholar Abdelfetah Zeraoui Hamadache called for Adonis books to be burnedAdonis: fatwa calling for burning my books in Algeria is shameful http://www.echoroukonline.com/ara/mobile/articles/189272.htmlLes salafistes alg√©riens du Front de la Sahwa en campagne contre \\"le parti de la France\\" http://www.huffpostmaghreb.com/2014/05/30/salafistes-algeriens- camp_n_5415386.html following a poem allegedly attributed to him, this came after the Salafi leader listened to the poem on social networks, he then issued a fatwa calling for burning Adonis' books in Algeria and in the Arab World. The poem was later proven as counterfeit (the poem is very weak in linguistic structure and differ greatly from Adonis literary style) Adonis commentedIn a phone interview with \\"Echorouk Newspaper\\" published on 23 December 2013\\"I am sorry that I am discussing a counterfeiting at this level. I hope that the source of the so-called poem is published. This is a shame for an Islamic scholar, the Arabic language and the entire Arab poem heritage.\\" He added: \\"I am not sad about burning my books because this is an old phenomenon in our history. We are fighting to found a dialogue and a debate in a peaceful way. Founding differences in opinions is a wealth source. This counterfeiting humiliates Arabic.\\"Adonis: fatwa calling for burning my books in Algeria is shameful http://www.echoroukonline.com/ara/articles/189272.html?print =Arab Spring= On 14 June 2011, amid the bloody crackdown on the Syrian uprising, Adonis wrote an open letter to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in the Lebanese newspaper As-Safir- \\"as a citizen\\" he stresses. Describing Syria as a brutal police state, he attacked the ruling Ba'ath Party, called on the president to step down, and warned that \\"you cannot imprison an entire nation\\". He was nonetheless taken to task for addressing a tyrant as an elected president, and criticising the \\"violent tendencies\\" of some of his opponents. Adonis said on the subject: In August 2011, Adonis called in an interview in the Kuwaiti newspaper \\"Al Rai\\" for the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down because of his role in the Syrian civil war. He has also called upon the opposition to shun violence and engage in dialogue with the regime.\\"Constitution-building: The long march\\", \\"The Economist\\", 13 July 2013. Nobel Prize nomination A perennial contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, Adonis has been regularly nominated for the award since 1988. After winning Germany's major award the Goethe Prize in 2011, he emerged as a front runner to be awarded the Nobel Prize, but it was instead awarded to the Swedish poet Tomas Transtr√∂mer, with Peter Englund, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, commenting that there is no political dimension to the prize, and describing such a notion as \\"literature for dummies\\". Adonis has helped to spread Tomas Transtr√∂mer's fame in the Arab world, accompanying him on readings. He also wrote an introduction to the first translation of Transtr√∂mer's complete works into Arabic (published by Bedayat publishing house, translated by the Iraqi Kassem Hamady), stating that: Legacy and influence wall poem in Leiden Adonis' poetry and criticism have been credited with \\"far-reaching influence on the development of Arab poetry,\\" including the creation of \\"a new poetic language and rhythms, deeply rooted in classical poetry but employed to convey the predicament and responses of contemporary Arab society.\\"Abdullah al-Udhari, trans., \\"Victims of a Map\\" [bilingual selection of poems by Mahmud Darwish, Samih al-Qasim, and Adonis] (London: Al Saqi, 1984), 87. According to Mirene Ghossein, \\"one of the main contributions of Adonis to contemporary Arabic poetry is liberty-a liberty with themes, a liberty with words themselves through the uniqueness of poetic vision.\\"Mirene Ghossein, \\"Introduction\\" in Adonis, \\"The Blood of Adonis\\", translated from the Arabic by Samuel John Hazo (Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1971 Adonis is considered to have played a role in Arab modernism comparable to T. S. Eliot's in English-language poetry. The literary and cultural critic Edward Said, professor at Columbia University, called him \\"today's most daring and provocative Arab poet\\". The poet Samuel John Hazo, who translated Adonis's collection \\"The Pages of Day and Night,\\" said, \\"There is Arabic poetry before Adonis, and there is Arabic poetry after Adonis.\\" In 2007, Arabian Business named Adonis No. 26 in its 100 most powerful Arabs 2007 stating \\"Both as a poet and a theorist on poetry, and as a thinker with a radical vision of Arab culture, Adonis has exercised a powerful influence both on his contemporaries and on younger generations of Arab poets. His name has become synonymous with the Hadatha (modernism) which his poetry embodies. Critical works such as \\"ZamƒÅn al-shi'r\\" (1972) are landmarks in the history of literary criticism in the Arab world.\\" In 2017, the judges panel for the PEN/Nabokov Award cited \\"Through the force of his language, boldness of his innovation, and depth of his feeling, Ali Ahmad Said Esber, known as 'Adonis,' has helped make Arabic, one of the world's oldest poetic languages, vibrant and urgent. A visionary who has profound respect for the past, Adonis has articulated his cherished themes of identity, memory and exile in achingly beautiful verse, while his work as critic and translator makes him a living bridge between cultures. His great body of work is a reminder that any meaningful definition of literature in the 21st century must include contemporary Arabic poetry.\\" Awards and honours * 1968 Prix des Amis du Livre, Beirut * 1971 Syria-Lebanon Award of the International Poetry Forum, Pittsburg. * 1974 National Prize of Poetry, Beirut. * 1983 Member of the Acad√©mie St√©phane Mallarm√©. * 1983 Appointed \\"Officier des Arts et des Lettres\\" by the Ministry of Culture, Paris. * 1986 Grand Prix des Biennales Internationales de la Poesie de Li√®ge (Highest Award of the International Poem Biennial), Brussels. * 1990 Member of Acad√©mie Universelle des Cultures, Paris. * 1991 Prix Jean-Marlieu-Etranger, Marseille. * 1993 Feronia-Cita di Fiamo Priwe, Rome. * 1995 International Nazim Hikmet Poetry Award ‚Äì The first winner * 1995 Prix M√©diterran√©e-Etranger, Paris. * 1995 Prize of Lebanese Cultural Forum in France. * 1997 Golden Wreath of Struga Poetry Evenings * 1997 Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, France * 1999 Nonino Poetry Award, Italy * 2001 Goethe Medal * 2002‚Äì2003 Al Owais Award for Cultural & Scientific Achievements, co winner * 2003 America Award in Literature * 2006 Medal of the Italian Cabinet.

Louis' Christian army was defeated by the Ayyubid army led by Fakhr al-Din ibn Shaykh al-Shuyukh and their allies, the Bahriyya Mamluks, led by Faris ad-Din Aktai, Baibars al-Bunduqdari, Qutuz, Aybak and Qalawun. Shaykh al-Shuyukh was killed in the war, and Louis was captured. Approximately 800,000 bezants were paid in ransom for his return.Abu al-FidaAl-MaqriziIbn Taghri Background In 1244, the Khwarezmians, recently displaced by the advance of the Mongols, took Jerusalem on their way to ally with the Egyptian Mamluks. This returned Jerusalem to Muslim control, but the fall of Jerusalem was no longer a crucial event to European Christians, who had seen the city pass from Christian to Muslim control numerous times in the past two centuries. This time, despite calls from the Pope, there was no popular enthusiasm for a new crusade. There were also many conflicts within Europe that kept its leaders from embarking on the Crusade. Pope Innocent IV and Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor continued the papal-imperial struggle. Frederick had captured and imprisoned clerics on their way to the First Council of Lyon, and in 1245 he was formally deposed by Innocent IV. Pope Gregory IX had also earlier offered King Louis' brother, count Robert of Artois, the German throne, but Louis had refused. Thus, the Holy Roman Emperor was in no position to crusade. B√©la IV of Hungary was rebuilding his kingdom from the ashes after the devastating Mongol invasion of 1241. Henry III of England was still struggling with Simon de Montfort and other problems in England. Henry and Louis were not on the best of terms, being engaged in the Capetian-Plantagenet struggle, and while Louis was away on crusade the English king signed a truce promising not to attack French lands. Louis IX had also invited King Haakon IV of Norway to crusade, sending the English chronicler Matthew Paris as an ambassador, but again was unsuccessful. The only king interested in beginning another crusade therefore was Louis IX, who declared his intent to go east in 1245. A much smaller force of Englishmen, led by William Longesp√©e, also took the cross. Fighting Map of Seventh Crusade Engraving representing the departure from Aigues-Mortes of King Louis IX for the crusade (by Gustave Dor√©) France was one of the strongest states in Europe at the time, as the Albigensian Crusade had brought Provence into Parisian control. Poitou was ruled by Louis IX's brother Alphonse of Poitiers, who joined him on his crusade in 1245. Another brother, Charles I of Anjou, also joined Louis. For the next three years Louis collected an ecclesiastical tenth (mostly from church tithes), and in 1248 he and his approximately 15,000-strong army that included 3,000 knights, and 5,000 crossbowmen sailed on 36 ships from the ports of Aigues-Mortes, which had been specifically built to prepare for the crusade, and Marseille. Louis IX's financial preparations for this expedition were comparatively well organized, and he was able to raise approximately 1,500,000 livres tournois. However, many nobles who joined Louis on the expedition had to borrow money from the royal treasury, and the crusade turned out to be very expensive. They sailed first to Cyprus and spent the winter on the island, negotiating with various other powers in the east. The Latin Empire, set up after the Fourth Crusade, asked for his help against the Byzantine, Empire of Nicaea, and the Principality of Antioch, and the Knights Templar wanted his help in Syria where the Muslims had recently captured Sidon. Nonetheless, Egypt was the object of his crusade, and he landed in 1249 at Damietta on the Nile. Egypt would, Louis thought, provide a base from which to attack Jerusalem, and its wealth and supply of grain would keep the crusaders fed and equipped. On 6 June Damietta was taken with little resistance from the Egyptians, who withdrew further up the Nile. The flooding of the Nile had not been taken into account, however, and it soon grounded Louis and his army at Damietta for six months, where the knights sat back and enjoyed the spoils of war. Louis ignored the agreement made during the Fifth Crusade that Damietta should be given to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, now a rump state in Acre, but he did set up an archbishopric there (under the authority of the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem) and used the city as a base to direct military operations against the Muslims of Syria. Louis IX being taken prisoner at the Battle of Fariskur (Gustave Dor√©) In November, Louis marched towards Cairo, and almost at the same time, the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt, as-Salih Ayyub, died. A force led by Robert of Artois, alongside the Templars and the English contingent led by William Longesp√©e, attacked the Egyptian camp at Gideila and advanced to Al Mansurah where they were defeated at the Battle of Al Mansurah. Robert and William were killed, and only a small handful survived. Meanwhile, Louis' main force was attacked by the Mameluk Baibars, the commander of the army and a future sultan himself. Louis was defeated as well, but he did not withdraw to Damietta for months, preferring to besiege Mansourah, which ended in starvation and death for the crusaders. In showing utter agony, a Templar knight lamented: In March 1250 Louis finally tried to return to Damietta, but he was taken captive at the Battle of Fariskur, where his army was annihilated. Louis fell ill with dysentery, and was cured by an Arab physician. In May he was ransomed for 800,000 bezants, half of which was to be paid before the King left Egypt, with Damietta also being surrendered as a term in the agreement. Upon this, he immediately left Egypt for Acre, one of few remaining crusader possessions in Syria.Watterson, Barbara. The Egyptians. Blackwell Publishing, 1998. page 261Al-Maqrizi Aftermath Louis made an alliance with the Mamluks, who at the time were rivals of the Sultan of Damascus, and from his new base in Acre began to rebuild the other crusader cities, particularly Jaffa and Saida.Joinville and Villehardouin: Chronicles of the Crusades, translated by M.R.B. Shaw, pages 295‚Äì316, Penguin Classics: New York, 1963 Although the Kingdom of Cyprus claimed authority there, Louis was the de facto ruler. In 1254 Louis' money ran out, and his presence was needed in France where his mother and regent Blanche of Castile had recently died. Before leaving he established a standing French garrison at Acre, the capital of the Kingdom of Jerusalem after the loss of Jerusalem, at the expense of the French crown; it remained there until the fall of Acre in 1291.Keen, p. 94 His crusade was a failure, but he was considered a saint by many, and his fame gave him an even greater authority in Europe than the Holy Roman Emperor. In 1270 he attempted another crusade, though it too would end in failure. The history of the Seventh Crusade was written by Jean de Joinville, who was also a participant, Matthew Paris and many Muslim historians. Literary response The failure of the Seventh Crusade engendered several poetic responses from the Occitan troubadours. Austorc d'Aorlhac, composing shortly after the Crusade, was surprised that God would allow Louis IX to be defeated, but not surprised that some Christians would therefore convert to Islam.Alfred Jeanroy, \\"Le troubadour Austorc d'Aurillac et son sirvent√©s sur la septi√®me Croisade,\\" Romanische Forschungen, 23 (1907), p. 82. In a slightly later poem, D'un sirventes m'es gran voluntatz preza, Bernart de Rovenac attacks both James I of Aragon and Henry III of England for neglecting to defend \\"their fiefs\\" that the rei que conquer Suria (\\"king who conquered Syria\\") had possessed. The \\"king who conquered Syria\\" is a mocking reference to Louis, who was still in Syria (1254) when Bernart was writing, probably in hopes that the English and Aragonese kings would take advantage of the French monarch's absence. Bertran d'Alamanon criticized Charles of Anjou's neglect of Provence in favor of crusading. He wrote one of his last works, which bemoans Christendom's decline overseas, between the Seventh and Eighth Crusades (1260‚Äì1265).

This was the first of several cases across the United States that were reported to the police as supposed acts of retaliation for the attacks. Balbir Singh Sodhi, who had a beard and wore a turban in accordance with his Sikh faith, was profiled as an Arab Muslim and murdered by 42-year-old Frank Silva Roque, a Boeing aircraft mechanic at a local repair facility who held a criminal record for an attempted robbery in California. Roque had reportedly told friends that he was \\"going to go out and shoot some towel-heads\\" the day of the attacks. Roque was sentenced to death (commuted later to life imprisonment) for first degree murder.  Background  Born in Punjab, India, Balbir Singh Sodhi was a member of the Sikh religion. He immigrated to the United States in 1989 and initially resided in Los Angeles, where he worked as a computer engineer and analyst at HP. He saved enough money to buy a gas station and several affiliated franchises in Phoenix, Arizona and moved there. On September 11, 2001, members of al-Qaeda, a militant Islamist group, hijacked four airplanes and perpetrated the 9/11 attacks, killing 2,977 victims. According to family members, Sodhi had become distraught by the attacks. Roque shootings On September 15, 2001, Roque took his Chevrolet S-10 from the Wild Hare sports bar in Mesa, where he had reportedly been ranting about immigrants, and drove to the Chevron gas station owned by Sodhi. Roque shot Sodhi five times from his truck with a .380 handgun, killing him. At the time of the shooting, Sodhi was helping landscaper Luis Ledesma plant flowers around the edge of his gas station. Roque, who apparently wanted revenge for the 9/11 attacks, mistook him as an Arab Muslim because of the clothes he wore, his turban, and his beard. Roque then drove to a Mobil gas station 10 miles away. Twenty minutes after the first shooting, he shot at a Lebanese-American clerk from his truck, but missed. Roque then drove to his former residence, which had been purchased by a local Afghan family, and fired multiple rounds at the outside of the house. After fleeing the scene of the final shooting, Roque was reported to have gone to a local bar and boasted, \\"They're investigating the murder of a turban-head down the street.\\" Arrest, trial, conviction Police arrested Roque the next day, initially unaware of the later shooting incidents. He reportedly shouted slogans including \\"I am a patriot!\\" and \\"I stand for America all the way!\\" during his arrest. His bail was set at $1 million. Roque's trial by jury began on August 18, 2003. Defense attorneys argued he was not guilty due to insanity, claiming that he had a diminished IQ and heard relentless voices telling him that Arabs were Satanic and must be killed. Two coworkers testified that Roque was \\"narrow-minded\\" and that he hated both immigrants and Arabs. Roque's defense attorney characterized him as mentally ill, and noted that his mother had twice been hospitalized for schizophrenia, a condition which has been shown to appear in those genetically predisposed to it. On September 30, 2003, he was found guilty of first degree murder, and was sentenced to death nine days later. On July 19, 2005, Roque was found guilty of an unspecified conspiracy charge while in prison, specified only as a violent crime. On February 27, 2006, he was found guilty of having manufactured a primitive weapon in prison three days earlier. In August 2006, the Arizona Supreme Court changed Roque's death sentence to a sentence of life in prison without parole, citing his low IQ and mental illness as mitigating factors. The trial was aired by Court TV in a five-part series. Sukhpal Singh Sodhi On August 4, 2002, less than a year after Balbir's death, his younger brother Sukhpal was shot to death while driving his taxicab in San Francisco, apparently killed by a stray bullet from a nearby gang fight. In response to this second tragedy, Balbir's son said, \\"What are you going to do with anger?

They are a geographically widespread and numerically abundant family of epipelagic fish inhabiting warm waters around the world. The halfbeaks are named for their distinctive jaws, in which the lower jaws are significantly longer than the upper jaws. The similar viviparous halfbeaks (family Zenarchopteridae) have often been included in this family. Though not commercially important themselves, these forage fish support artisanal fisheries and local markets worldwide. They are also fed upon by other commercially important predatory fishes, such as billfishes, mackerels, and sharks. Taxonomy In 1758, Carl Linnaeus was the first to scientifically describe a halfbeak, Esox brasiliensis (now Hemiramphus brasiliensis). In 1775 Peter Forssk√•l described two more species as Esox, Esox far and Esox marginatus. It was not until 1816 that Georges Cuvier created the genus Hemiramphus; from then on, all three were classified as Hemiramphus. In 1859, Gill erected Hemiramphidae, deriving its name from Hemiramphus, the family's type genus. The name comes from the Greek hemi, meaning half, and rhamphos, meaning beak or bill. There are currently eight genera within the family Hemirampphidae: * Arrhamphus G√ºnther, 1866 * Chriodorus Goode & Bean, 1882 * Euleptorhamphus Gill, 1859 * Hemiramphus Cuvier, 1816 * Hyporhamphus Gill, 1859 * Melapedalion Fowler, 1934 * Oxyporhamphus Gill, 1864 * Rhynchorhamphus Fowler, 1928 Oxyporhamphus micropterus has been considered either a halfbeak or a flyingfish. This family is primarily marine and found in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, though some inhabit estuaries and rivers. Evolution The halfbeaks' fossil record extends into the Lower Tertiary. The earliest known halfbeak is Brachyrhamphus bolcensis from the Eocene at Monte Bolca, Italy. Apart from differences in the length of the upper and lower jaws, recent and fossil halfbeaks are distinguished by the fusion of the third pair of upper pharyngeal bones into a plate. Phylogeny The phylogeny of the halfbeaks is in a state of flux. On the one hand, there is little question that they are most closely related to three other families of streamlined, surface water fishes: the flyingfishes, needlefishes, and sauries. Traditionally, these four families have been taken to together comprise the order Beloniformes. The halfbeaks and flyingfishes are considered to form one group, the superfamily Exocoetoidea, and the needlefishes and sauries another, the superfamily Scomberesocoidea. On the other hand, recent studies have demonstrated that rather than forming a single monophyletic group (a clade), the halfbeak family actually includes a number of lineages ancestral to the flyingfishes and the needlefishes. In other words, as traditionally defined, the halfbeak family is paraphyletic. Within the subfamily Hemiramphinae, the \\"flying halfbeak\\" genus Oxyporhamphus has proved to be particularly problematic; while morphologically closer to the flyingfishes, molecular evidence places it with Hemiramphus and Euleptorhamphus. Together, these three genera form the sister group to the flyingfish family. The other two hemiramphine genera Hyporhamphus and Arrhamphus form another clade of less clear placement. Rather than being closely related to the flyingfishes, the subfamily Zenarchopterinae appears to be the sister group of the needlefishes and sauries. This is based on the pharyngeal jaw apparatus, sperm ultrastructure, and molecular evidence. However, this hypothesis has awkward implications for how the morphological evolution of the group is understood, because the fused pharyngeal plate has been considered reliably diagnostic of the halfbeak family. Furthermore, the existing theory that because juvenile needlefish pass through a developmental stage where the lower jaw is longer than the upper jaw (the so-called \\"halfbeak stage\\") the theory that halfbeaks are paedomorphic needlefish is untenable. In fact the unequal lengths of the upper and lower jaws of halfbeaks appears to be the basal condition, with needlefish being relatively derived in comparison. Morphology Preserved specimen The halfbeaks are elongate, streamlined fish adapted to living in open water. Halfbeaks can grow to over SL in the case of Euleptorhampus viridis. The scales are relatively large, cycloid (smooth), and easily detached. There are no spines in the fins. A distinguishing characteristic is that the third pair of upper pharyngeal bones are anklylosed (fused) into a plate. Halfbeaks are one of several fish families that lack a stomach, all of which possess a pharyngeal jaw apparatus (pharyngeal mill). Most species have an extended lower jaw, at least as juveniles, though this feature may be lost as the fish mature, as with Chriodorus, for example. As is typical for surface dwelling, open water fish, most species are silvery, darker above and lighter below, an example of countershading. The tip of the lower jaw is bright red or orange in most species. Halfbeaks carry several adaptations to feeding at the water surface. The eyes and nostrils are at the top of the head and the upper jaw is mobile, but not the lower jaw. Combined with their streamlined shape and the concentration of fins towards the back (similar to that of a pike), these adaptations allow halfbeaks to locate, catch, and swallow food items very effectively. Range and habitat A marine halfbeak, Hemiramphus balao. Halfbeaks inhabit warm seas, predominantly at the surface, in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans. A small number are found in estuaries. Most species of marine halfbeaks are known from continental coastlines, but some extend into the western and central Pacific, and one species (Hyporhamphus ihi) is endemic to New Zealand. Hemiramphus is a worldwide marine genus. Ecology and behavior =Feeding= Marine halfbeaks are omnivores feeding on algae; marine plants such as seagrasses; plankton; invertebrates such as pteropods and crustaceans; and smaller fishes. For some subtropical species at least, juveniles are more predatory than adults. Some tropical species feed on animals during the day and plants at night, while other species alternate between carnivory in the summer and herbivory in the winter. They are in turn eaten by many ecologically and commercially important fish, such as billfish, mackerel, and sharks, and so are a key link between trophic levels. =Behavior= Marine halfbeaks are typically pelagic schooling forage fish. The southern sea garfish Hyporhamphus melanochir for example is found in sheltered bays, coastal seas, estuaries around southern Australia in waters down to a depth of . These fish school near the surface at night but swim closer to the sea floor during the day, particularly among beds of seagrasses. Genetic analysis of the different sub-populations of the eastern sea garfish Hyporhamphus melanochir in South Australian coastal waters reveals that there is a small but consistent migration of individuals among theme, sufficient to keep them genetically homogeneous. Some marine halfbeaks, including Euleptorhamphus velox and Euleptorhamphus viridis, are known for their ability to jump out of the water and glide over the surface for considerable distances, and have consequently sometimes been called flying halfbeaks. =Reproduction= Hemiramphidae species are all external fertilizers. They are usually egg-layers and often produce relatively small numbers of fairly large eggs for fish of their size, typically in shallow coastal waters, such as the seagrass meadows of Florida Bay. The eggs of Hemiramphus brasiliensis and H. balao are typically in diameter and have attaching filaments. They hatch when they grow to about in diameter. Hyporhamphus melanochir eggs are slightly larger, around in diameter, and are unusually large when they hatch, being up to in size. Relatively little is known about the ecology of juvenile marine halfbeaks, though estuarine habitats seem to be favored by at least some species. The southern sea garfish Hyporhamphus melanochir grows rapidly at first, attaining a length of up to in the first three years, after which point growth slows. This species lives for a maximum age of about 9 years, at which point the fish reach up to and weigh about . Relationship to humans =Halfbeak fisheries= Halfbeaks are not a major target for commercial fisheries, though small fisheries for them exist in some places, for example in South Australia where fisheries target the southern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus melanochir). and the eastern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus australis). Halfbeaks are caught by a variety of methods including seines and pelagic trawls, dip-netting under lights at night, and with haul nets. They are utilized fresh, dried, smoked, or salted, and they are considered good eating. However, even where halfbeaks are targeted by fisheries, they tend to be of secondary importance compared with other edible fish species. In some localities significant bait fisheries exist to supply sport fishermen. One study of a bait fishery in Florida that targets Hemiramphus brasiliensis and Hemiramphus balao suggests that despite increases in the size of the fishery the population is stable and the annual catch is valued at around $500,000.

The present structure was built in the 15th century and may have been on the site of a 12th-century castle. The castle has a notable garden, which is designed and maintained to a very high standard. The chapel, St. Mary's Sudeley, is the burial place of the English queen Catherine Parr (1512‚Äì1548) and contains her marble tomb. Unusually for a castle chapel, St Mary's of Sudeley is part of the local parish of the Church of England. Sudeley is also one of the few castles left in England that is still a residence. As a result, the castle is only open to visitors on specific dates, and private family quarters are closed to the public. It is a Grade I listed building, and recognised as an internationally important structure. History The Queen's Gardens at Sudeley Castle A castle may have been built on the site during the reign of King Stephen (1135‚Äì1154). In 1442, Ralph Boteler, who was created Baron Sudeley by King Henry VI, inherited Sudeley Castle and built the current castle on its present site, using what he had earned fighting in the Hundred Years' War. He built quarters for servants and men at arms on the double courtyard that was surrounded by a moat. He also added state and family apartments on the second courtyard. The Chapel, which would become St. Mary's, and the tithe barn were also built under Boteler. Unfortunately, Boteler failed to gain royal permission to crenellate the castle, and had to seek King Henry VI's pardon.John Ashdown-Hill, \\"Eleanor The Secret Queen\\", Page 51 The History Press, 2009 Due to his support for the Lancastrian cause, King Edward IV confiscated the castle from Boteler in 1469, and gave it to his brother, the future King Richard III. Richard used the castle as a base for the Battle of Tewkesbury. He later exchanged this property for Richmond Castle, making Sudeley property of the crown. Ownership of the castle returned to Richard when he became king in 1483. During his reign, the Banqueting Hall, with oriel windows, and the adjoining state rooms, now in ruins, were built in place of the eastern range of Boteler's inner court as part of a royal suite. After King Richard's death at the Battle of Bosworth, Sudeley passed to the new king, Henry VII, who then gave it to his uncle, Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford. By the time Henry VIII succeeded to the throne, the castle was the property of the Crown again. In 1535, King Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn, visited the castle, which had been empty and unattended for some time. The Gatehouse When King Henry VIII died, the castle became the property of his son, King Edward VI, who gave it to his uncle, Thomas Seymour, whom he made Baron Seymour of Sudeley. In early 1547, Lord Seymour married King Edward's stepmother, the dowager queen Catherine Parr. At the announcement of her pregnancy in late 1547, Seymour began to renovate the castle for Catherine's use, but only one room that he built remains today. Lord Seymour and Queen Catherine decided that she should move to Sudeley for the final months of her pregnancy. At about six months, Catherine was accompanied by Lady Jane Grey and a large retinue of ladies to attend on her, as well as over one hundred gentlemen of the household and Yeomen of the guard. Catherine's sister Anne Herbert, Countess of Pembroke, also came and attended upon her as her chief lady and groom of the stool. Catherine gave birth to her daughter, Lady Mary Seymour, on 30 August 1548, only to die on 5 September of that year. She was buried in the Chapel. Her grave was later discovered in 1782, after the castle and the chapel had been left in ruins by the English Civil War. She was later reinterred by the Rector of Sudeley in 1817, and an elaborate tomb was erected in her honour. In 1549, Lord Seymour's ambitions led him to be arrested and beheaded; after which, Sudeley Castle became the property of Catherine's brother, William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton. After Parr's involvement with the plot to put Lady Jane Grey on the throne, he was stripped of his property and title by Queen Mary I. Parr regained his titles later on under Queen Elizabeth I, but the castle remained property of the Crown. In 1554, Queen Mary I gave Sudeley Castle to John Brydges, 1st Baron Chandos, and it remained his property throughout her reign and the reign of Queen Elizabeth I as well. It was at Sudeley that Elizabeth was entertained three times. A spectacular three-day feast was held there to celebrate the anniversary of the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1592, and Elizabeth Brydges was presented to the queen in the guise of Daphne.Elizabeth Zeman Kolkovich, The Elizabethan Country House Entertainment (Cambridge, 2016), pp. 73-8. John Brydges is buried in the chapel, as is Giles Brugge, 6th Baron Chandos. Having been slighted in the English Civil War, the castle remained a 'romantic ruin' for nearly two centuries before being bought by two brothers, glove makers from Worcester. The restoration work they began was taken over by their heir and nephew, John Coucher Dent, and his wife Emma. In 1877, she described the castle thus: > Few residences can boast a greater antiquity, or have witnessed more > striking changes. A mansum, or manor-house, before the Conquest, a baronial > castle in the time of Stephen, then alternately going to decay, or rising > into additional magnificence, with stately towers to overlook the vale ‚Äî > again suffering from neglect, and once more right royally restored and > beautified to receive the widowed Queen as Seymour's Bride, with all her > lordly retinue.Emma Dent, Annals of Winchcombe and Sudeley (London: John > Murray, 1877)p. 1. Current ownership The current owners are Elizabeth, Lady Ashcombe, widow of Henry Cubitt, 4th Baron Ashcombe, and her two children: Henry Dent- Brocklehurst and Mollie Dent-Brocklehurst. After the death of Lady Ashcombe's first husband Mark Dent-Brocklehurst in 1972, she owns 50 percent of the equity, while her children each own 25 percent. Mark inherited Sudeley in 1949 after the death of his father. His mother decided to stay at the castle though until 1969. It was at this time that Mark and his American-born wife, Elizabeth, decided to open up the castle to the public. It took two years to convert the home into a tourist attraction, but Mark died in 1972, leaving a large amount of both debts and death duties. Lady Ashcombe married Baron Ashcombe, and the couple made major renovations. Lady Ashcombe and her children have since taken over the management of the castle as a visitor attraction.Sudeley History Timeline BBC Four featured an investigation into the castle on 27 June 2007 titled Crisis At The Castle. This detailed the turmoil associated with managing the castle within three sets of owners and their families. Closing the castle to the general public on some weekdays meant that visitors were disheartened when embarking on their day trips, and resulted in a dramatic fall in visitor numbers in the three years leading up to the creation of the programme. The castle is sometimes used for high- profile events, such as the 2007 wedding of English actress Elizabeth Hurley to Indian textile heir Arun Nayar, which took place in the private chapel. Tourist attractions Katherine Parr Exhibition: Rare copies of original books written by Katherine Parr, the first queen to have her own work published, are displayed in an exhibition to celebrate this remarkable queen. The exhibition also features her love letters to Thomas Seymour and the eyewitness account of the discovery of her body at Sudeley in 1782. These, together with items taken from her tomb, help to illustrate Dr David Starkey's film ‚ÄòThe Life and Loves of Katherine Parr, Queen of England and Mistress of Sudeley‚Äô, which is shown alongside the exhibition. Visitors can also visit Katherine Parr's tomb in St Mary's Church ‚Äì Sudeley is notable for being the only private castle to have a queen buried in its grounds. Textiles Exhibition: This features a collection of textiles from Sudeley's history displaying textile techniques spanning over 400 years. This exhibition has been described as one of the best in the country and includes a 17th-century stumpwork casket, delicate lace and a Sheldon tapestry.

Gardens The knot garden Sudeley Castle's has nine individual gardens. The centrepiece is the Queens Garden, so named because four of England's queens ‚Äì Anne Boleyn, Katherine Parr, Lady Jane Grey and Elizabeth I ‚Äì once admired the hundreds of varieties of roses found in the garden. St Mary's Church, in which Katherine Parr is buried, is bordered by the White Garden, rich with peonies, clematis, roses and tulips, where Katherine and her companion, Lady Jane Grey would have entered the church for daily prayers. The Knot Garden is based on a dress pattern worn by Elizabeth I in a portrait that hangs in the castle. More than 1,200 box hedges form its intricate geometric design, interspersed with coloured gravel and a Moorish mosaic fountain at the centre. The ruins of the 15th-century tithe barn form the centre of a garden, featuring a carp pond surrounded by wisteria, primroses, hollyhocks and cardoons. Other gardens at Sudeley include the Secret Garden, the Mulberry Garden and the Herb Garden Walk. In the Mulberry Garden, country flowers and greenery surrounds the mulberry tree planted in 1865 by Emma Dent. The Herb Garden Walk takes visitors through a fine collection of plants which have been cultivated for their medical properties for thousands of years.

While the second law of thermodynamics predicts that the entropy of an isolated system should tend to increase until it reaches equilibrium, it became apparent after the discovery of statistical mechanics that the second law is only a statistical one, suggesting that there should always be some nonzero probability that the entropy of an isolated system might spontaneously decrease; the fluctuation theorem precisely quantifies this probability. Statement of the fluctuation theorem Roughly, the fluctuation theorem relates to the probability distribution of the time-averaged irreversible entropy production, denoted \\\\overline{\\\\Sigma}_t. The theorem states that, in systems away from equilibrium over a finite time t, the ratio between the probability that \\\\overline{\\\\Sigma}_t takes on a value A and the probability that it takes the opposite value, ‚àíA, will be exponential in At. In other words, for a finite non-equilibrium system in a finite time, the FT gives a precise mathematical expression for the probability that entropy will flow in a direction opposite to that dictated by the second law of thermodynamics. Mathematically, the FT is expressed as: : \\\\frac{\\\\Pr(\\\\overline{\\\\Sigma}_{t}=A)}{\\\\Pr(\\\\overline{\\\\Sigma}_{t}=-A)}=e^{At}. This means that as the time or system size increases (since \\\\Sigma is extensive), the probability of observing an entropy production opposite to that dictated by the second law of thermodynamics decreases exponentially. The FT is one of the few expressions in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics that is valid far from equilibrium. The FT was first proposed and tested using computer simulations, by Denis Evans, E.G.D. Cohen and Gary Morriss in 1993 in the journal Physical Review Letters. The first derivation was given by Evans and Debra Searles in 1994. Since then, much mathematical and computational work has been done to show that the FT applies to a variety of statistical ensembles. The first laboratory experiment that verified the validity of the FT was carried out in 2002. In this experiment, a plastic bead was pulled through a solution by a laser. Fluctuations in the velocity were recorded that were opposite to what the second law of thermodynamics would dictate for macroscopic systems. See and later. This work was widely reported in the press. In 2020, observations at high spatial and spectral resolution of the solar photosphere have show that solar turbulent convection satisfies the symmetries predicted by the fluctuation relation at a local level. Note that the FT does not state that the second law of thermodynamics is wrong or invalid. The second law of thermodynamics is a statement about macroscopic systems. The FT is more general. It can be applied to both microscopic and macroscopic systems. When applied to macroscopic systems, the FT is equivalent to the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Second law inequality A simple consequence of the fluctuation theorem given above is that if we carry out an arbitrarily large ensemble of experiments from some initial time t=0, and perform an ensemble average of time averages of the entropy production then an exact consequence of the FT is that the ensemble average cannot be negative for any value of the averaging time t: : \\\\left\\\\langle {\\\\overline \\\\Sigma _t } \\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\ge 0,\\\\quad \\\\forall t. This inequality is called the Second Law Inequality. This inequality can be proved for systems with time dependent fields of arbitrary magnitude and arbitrary time dependence. It is important to understand what the Second Law Inequality does not imply. It does not imply that the ensemble averaged entropy production is non-negative at all times. This is untrue, as consideration of the entropy production in a viscoelastic fluid subject to a sinusoidal time dependent shear rate shows. In this example the ensemble average of the time integral of the entropy production over one cycle is however nonnegative - as expected from the Second Law Inequality. Nonequilibrium partition identity Another remarkably simple and elegant consequence of the Fluctuation Theorem is the so-called \\"Nonequilibrium partition identity\\" (NPI): : \\\\left\\\\langle {\\\\exp [ - \\\\overline \\\\Sigma_t \\\\; t ]} \\\\right\\\\rangle = 1,\\\\quad \\\\text{ for all } t . Thus in spite of the Second Law Inequality which might lead you to expect that the average would decay exponentially with time, the exponential probability ratio given by the FT exactly cancels the negative exponential in the average above leading to an average which is unity for all time. Implications There are many important implications from the Fluctuation Theorem. One is that small machines (such as nanomachines or even mitochondria in a cell) will spend part of their time actually running in \\"reverse\\". What we mean with \\"reverse\\" is that it is possible to observe that these small molecular machines are able to generate work by taking heat from the environment. This is possible because there exists a symmetry relation in the work fluctuations associated with the forward and reverse changes a system undergoes as it is driven away from thermal equilibrium by the action of an external perturbation, which is a result predicted by the Crooks fluctuation theorem. The environment itself continuously drives these molecular machines away from equilibrium and the fluctuations it generates over the system are very relevant because the probability of observing an apparent violation of the second law of thermodynamics becomes significant at this scale. This is counterintuitive because, from a macroscopic point of view, it would describe complex processes running in reverse. For example, a jet engine running in reverse, taking in ambient heat and exhaust fumes to generate kerosene and oxygen. Nevertheless the size of such a system makes this observation almost impossible to occur. Such a process is possible to be observed microscopically because, as it has been stated above, the probability of observing a \\"reverse\\" trajectory depends on system size and is significant for molecular machines if an appropriate measurement instrument is available. This is the case with the development of new biophysical instruments such as the optical tweezers or the atomic force microscope. Crooks fluctuation theorem has been verified through RNA folding experiments. Dissipation function Strictly speaking the fluctuation theorem refers to a quantity known as the dissipation function. In thermostatted nonequilibrium states that are close to equilibrium, the long time average of the dissipation function is equal to the average entropy production. However the FT refers to fluctuations rather than averages. The dissipation function is defined as, : \\\\Omega _t (\\\\Gamma ) = \\\\int_0^t {ds\\\\;\\\\Omega (\\\\Gamma ;s)} \\\\equiv \\\\ln \\\\left[ {\\\\frac} \\\\right] + \\\\frac{kT} where k is Boltzmann's constant, f(\\\\Gamma , 0) is the initial (t = 0) distribution of molecular states \\\\Gamma , and \\\\Gamma (t) is the molecular state arrived at after time t, under the exact time reversible equations of motion. f(\\\\Gamma (t),0) is the INITIAL distribution of those time evolved states. Note: in order for the FT to be valid we require that f(\\\\Gamma (t),0) e 0,\\\\;\\\\forall \\\\Gamma (0) . This condition is known as the condition of ergodic consistency. It is widely satisfied in common statistical ensembles - e.g. the canonical ensemble. The system may be in contact with a large heat reservoir in order to thermostat the system of interest. If this is the case \\\\Delta Q(t) is the heat lost to the reservoir over the time (0,t) and T is the absolute equilibrium temperature of the reservoir - see Williams et al., Phys Rev E70, 066113(2004). With this definition of the dissipation function the precise statement of the FT simply replaces entropy production with the dissipation function in each of the FT equations above. Example: If one considers electrical conduction across an electrical resistor in contact with a large heat reservoir at temperature T, then the dissipation function is : \\\\Omega = - JF_e V/{kT}\\\\ the total electric current density J multiplied by the voltage drop across the circuit, F_e , and the system volume V, divided by the absolute temperature T, of the heat reservoir times Boltzmann's constant. Thus the dissipation function is easily recognised as the Ohmic work done on the system divided by the temperature of the reservoir. Close to equilibrium the long time average of this quantity is (to leading order in the voltage drop), equal to the average spontaneous entropy production per unit time - see de Groot and Mazur \\"Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics\\" (Dover), equation (61), page 348. However, the Fluctuation Theorem applies to systems arbitrarily far from equilibrium where the definition of the spontaneous entropy production is problematic. The fluctuation theorem and Loschmidt's paradox The second law of thermodynamics, which predicts that the entropy of an isolated system out of equilibrium should tend to increase rather than decrease or stay constant, stands in apparent contradiction with the time-reversible equations of motion for classical and quantum systems. The time reversal symmetry of the equations of motion show that if one films a given time dependent physical process, then playing the movie of that process backwards does not violate the laws of mechanics. It is often argued that for every forward trajectory in which entropy increases, there exists a time reversed anti trajectory where entropy decreases, thus if one picks an initial state randomly from the system's phase space and evolves it forward according to the laws governing the system, decreasing entropy should be just as likely as increasing entropy. It might seem that this is incompatible with the second law of thermodynamics which predicts that entropy tends to increase. The problem of deriving irreversible thermodynamics from time-symmetric fundamental laws is referred to as Loschmidt's paradox. The mathematical derivation of the Fluctuation Theorem and in particular the Second Law Inequality shows that, for a nonequilibrium process, the ensemble averaged value for the dissipation function will be greater than zero - see The Fluctuation Theorem from Advances in Physics 51: 1529. This result requires causality, i.e. that cause (the initial conditions) precede effect (the value taken on by the dissipation function). This is clearly demonstrated in section 6 of that paper, where it is shown how one could use the same laws of mechanics to extrapolate backwards from a later state to an earlier state, and in this case the Fluctuation Theorem would lead us to predict the ensemble average dissipation function to be negative, an anti-second law. This second prediction, which is inconsistent with the real world, is obtained using an anti-causal assumption. That is to say that effect (the value taken on by the dissipation function) precedes the cause (here the later state has been incorrectly used for the initial conditions). The Fluctuation Theorem shows how the 2nd law is a consequence of the assumption of causality. When we solve a problem we set the initial conditions and then let the laws of mechanics evolve the system forward in time, we don't solve problems by setting the final conditions and letting the laws of mechanics run backwards in time. Summary The fluctuation theorem is of fundamental importance to non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. The FT (together with the universal causation proposition) gives a generalisation of the second law of thermodynamics which includes as a special case, the conventional second law. It is then easy to prove the Second Law Inequality and the NonEquilibrium Partition Identity. When combined with the central limit theorem, the FT also implies the Green-Kubo relations for linear transport coefficients, close to equilibrium. The FT is however, more general than the Green-Kubo Relations because unlike them, the FT applies to fluctuations far from equilibrium. In spite of this fact, scientists have not yet been able to derive the equations for nonlinear response theory from the FT. The FT does not imply or require that the distribution of time averaged dissipation be Gaussian. There are many examples known where the distribution of time averaged dissipation is non-Gaussian and yet the FT (of course) still correctly describes the probability ratios. Lastly the theoretical constructs used to prove the FT can be applied to nonequilibrium transitions between two different equilibrium states. When this is done the so-called Jarzynski equality or nonequilibrium work relation, can be derived. This equality shows how equilibrium free energy differences can be computed or measured (in the laboratory), from nonequilibrium path integrals. Previously quasi-static (equilibrium) paths were required. The reason why the fluctuation theorem is so fundamental is that its proof requires so little. It requires: *knowledge of the mathematical form of the initial distribution of molecular states, *that all time evolved final states at time t, must be present with nonzero probability in the distribution of initial states (t = 0) - the so-called condition of ergodic consistency and, *an assumption of time reversal symmetry. In regard to the latter \\"assumption\\", while the equations of motion of quantum dynamics may be time-reversible, quantum processes are nondeterministic by nature. What state a wave function collapses into cannot be predicted mathematically, and further the unpredictability of a quantum system comes not from the myopia of an observer‚Äôs perception, but on the intrinsically nondeterministic nature of the system itself. In physics, the laws of motion of classical mechanics exhibit time reversibility, as long as the operator œÄ reverses the conjugate momenta of all the particles of the system, i.e. \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbf{-p} (T-symmetry). In quantum mechanical systems, however, the weak nuclear force is not invariant under T-symmetry alone; if weak interactions are present reversible dynamics are still possible, but only if the operator œÄ also reverses the signs of all the charges and the parity of the spatial co-ordinates (C-symmetry and P-symmetry). This reversibility of several linked properties is known as CPT symmetry. Thermodynamic processes can be reversible or irreversible, depending on the change in entropy during the process.

The town stands at the crossroads of the Fosse Way Roman road (now the A429) and the A44. It is served by Moreton-in-Marsh railway station on the Cotswold Line. It is relatively flat and low-lying compared with the surrounding Cotswold Hills. The River Evenlode rises near Batsford, runs around the edge of Moreton and meanders towards Oxford, where it flows into the Thames just east of Eynsham. Just over east of Moreton, the Four shire stone marked the boundary of the historic counties of Gloucestershire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire and Oxfordshire, until the re-organisation of the county boundaries in 1931. Since then it marks the meeting place of Gloucestershire, Warwickshire and Oxfordshire.Information for record number MWA3814: The Four Shire Stone Warwickshire Museum Moreton-in-Marsh railway station on the Cotswold Line. Toponymy  Moreton is derived from Old English which means \\"Farmstead on the Moor\\" and \\"in Marsh\\" is from henne and mersh meaning a marsh used by birds such as moorhens.Mills, 2003, page not cited An alternative suggestion is that 'Marsh' is a corruption of 'March', early English for boundary. History A settlement was built during the British Iron Age just northwest of the town centre near the cricket ground. Archaeological research has found Roman pottery and coins at the site showing it remained occupied after the Roman invasion of Britain. During this period, the Fosse Way, one of the best preserved Roman routes in Britain, was constructed. It was initially constructed by the Roman army but was subsequently maintained by the local Civitas. The course can be traced through the county by the modern roads that tend to follow its course, although there are deviations such as south of the town where it crosses the hill into Stow-on-the-Wold. Moreton, is first mentioned as a Saxon settlement, around 577 AD. Following the Norman conquest of Britain, the township was part of the monastic property held by Westminster Abbey in London. Abbott Richard of Barking, began developing Moreton as a medieval market town between 1222 and 1246. The new town was built on common land bordering the Fosse Way to the northwest of the original Saxon settlement. An area that is still referred to as the \\"Old Town\\". To accommodate medieval markets, the new town has a long, wide High Street. The Curfew Tower on the corner of Oxford Street is probably 16th century.Verey, 1970, page 323 Its bell was cast in 1633 and its clock was built in 1648. The Church of England parish church of Saint David began as a chapel of ease for Blockley, to which the residents of Moreton had to transport their dead for burial.Elrington, 1965, pages 240‚Äì250 The early history of the church in Moreton is not clear, but there is evidence that a primitive Celtic place of worship preceded the church on the present site, which had seven springs. The church at Moreton came under the jurisdiction of the Batsford Estate, when that estate was given to the Bishops of Worcester in the 12th century. Latterly, the church in Moreton was a chapel-at-ease for Batsford, which was technically the parish church. The appointment of the vicar for Batsford with Moreton alternates between the Bishop of Gloucester and the Lord of the Manor at Batsford, currently Lord Dulverton, who, until the Second World War, exercised his right to collect a shilling (5 pence) a year for every shop window facing Moreton High Street. There is a tradition that the church was rebuilt and reconsecrated in the middle of the 16th century. The nave was enlarged in 1790, with a ¬£1,000 gift from Samuel Wilson Warneford, most of the church was rebuilt in 1858 and the tower was replaced in 1860. The chancel and south aisle were enlarged in 1892 and the east end of the south aisle has been used as a chapel since 1927. A nonconformist congregation started meeting in Moreton in 1796, was constituted as a Congregational church in 1801 and had a chapel built in 1817. In 1860‚Äì61 the Congregationalists replaced the chapel with a new one on the same site in a mixed neo-Grecian and Romanesque style.Verey, 1970, page 325 The congregation voted against the merger with the Presbyterians and remains a Congregational Chapel. The Roman Catholics, without their own church in Moreton, held a mass there on Sunday mornings for several years. The Stratford and Moreton Tramway was built between 1821 and 1826, linking Moreton with the Stratford-on-Avon Canal at Stratford. It was horse-drawn until 1859, when the section between Moreton and Shipston-on-Stour was converted to a branch line railway operated with steam locomotives. The Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway, built between 1845 and 1851, passes through Moreton. The railway station was opened in 1853. The Great Western Railway (GWR) took over the OW&W; Railway in 1862 and the Shipston-on- Stour branch in 1868. The GWR withdrew passenger trains from the branch in 1929 and British Railways withdrew freight traffic and the last train, Driver Ted Hardiman, Fireman Hughes and Guard Perry ran on 2 May 1960. The OW&W; Railway is now part of the Cotswold line. The line between Oxford (Wolverton Junction) and Worcester (Norton Junction) was singled, except for the distance between Shipton-under-Wychwood to Moreton-in-Marsh, in the 1970s, but subsequently the double track has been replaced, except between Evesham and Worcester (Norton Junction) in 2011. Traffic to and from Long Marston uses the west end of the line and freight services are planned to re-use this route. In 2019 the platforms were lengthened after the removal of all sidings from the station area. Redesdale Market Hall The Redesdale Market Hall was designed by the architect Sir Ernest George and built in 1887. The town was often misdescribed as \\"Moreton-in-the-Marsh\\" into the early 20th century. The name was confirmed as \\"Moreton-in-Marsh\\" before 1930. In 1940, a large area of level land east of the town was developed as RAF Moreton-in-Marsh and used as a training airfield, largely by Wellington bombers. 38 men flying to or from RAF Moreton-in-Marsh lost their lives during the Second World War. The former airfield is now the Fire Service College where senior fire officers from brigades all over the UK undergo operational, management and leadership training. The same complex is also now the headquarters of the Institution of Fire Engineers, the professional body for fire fighters, officers and civilians with an interest in fire engineering. Moreton-in-Marsh and Batsford War Memorial is in the High Street and commemorates the dead of the First and Second World Wars, together with one serviceman killed subsequently, and Diana Hope Rowden, a spy executed in 1944 who has served previously at RAF Moreton- in-Marsh. Despite the number of serving men in the Glorious Glosters all the men of the town returned safely from Korea. The last time Moreton was badly flooded was in 2007. The floods, which blocked the High Street, were fairly regular from the 1940s to the 1960s, until works were carried out on the ditches around the town, and the camber on the A44 descending to Moreton from Bourton on the Hill. These works appear to have resolved most of the problems. There was a Roman fort near Dorn (1 mile NW of Moreton) and the site of the annual Moreton and District Agricultural Show, held on the first Saturday in September, is actually on part of the site of the fort. The railway line to Worcester runs alongside the show ground, and at Dorn reaches the highest point between Oxford and Worcester. This is also the Thames/Severn watershed. Moreton was once the headquarters of the railway spot-hire company Cotswold Rail. Each September the town hosts the UK's largest one-day agricultural show. Held on part of the Batsford Estate, the show has been running since 1949.http://www.moretonshow.co.uk/ Rail services to/from Moreton-in-Marsh station are provided by Great Western Railway.

Since May 2019 Rachel Coxcoon, the Cabinet member for Planning Policy, Climate change and Energy, of the Liberal Democrats represents Moreton East; Clive Webster, who also sits on the Parish Council, represents Moreton West. Amenities North Cotswolds Hospital, on the southern outskirts of Moreton-in-Marsh Moreton has many buildings in characteristic Cotswold stone. There are two supermarkets (Aldi and the Co-Operative), two general stores (Spar and Tesco Express), and a number of antique shops, bars, cafes, hotels, inns and restaurants located down the High Street and Stow Road. A Caravan Club site is a short walk east on the Broadway Road (A44), past the Wellington Aviation Museum, a museum of the history of the Vickers Wellington bomber. Other local attractions include Batsford Arboretum near Batsford village and the onion-domed Sezincote house and gardens. The White Hart Royal, originally a seventeenth-century coaching inn, was occupied by King Charles I when he took shelter in the building following the Battle of Marston Moor (during the First English Civil War of 1644‚Äì1646) and supposedly left without paying his bill. https://www.whitehartroyal.co.uk/ The White Hart Royal Hotel Research by a branch of the Tolkien Society indicates that the Bell Inn was a source of inspiration for the Prancing Pony. The Bell is an eighteenth-century inn on the western side of the High Street. It was regularly visited by author J. R. R. Tolkien during his early years at the University of Oxford. The inn has been attributed as inspiration for The Prancing Pony which features in The Lord of the Rings (1954‚Äì1955). http://thebellinnmoreton.co.uk The Bell Inn Moreton Home Page The 300-year-old Black Bear Inn, on the eastern side of the High Street near the Curfew Tower, has enjoyed a long association with football.

The other two isomeric trimethylbenzenes are 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (pseudocumene) and 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene (hemimellitene). All three compounds have the formula C6H3(CH3)3, which is commonly abbreviated C6H3Me3. Mesitylene is a colourless liquid with sweet aromatic odor. It is a component of coal tar, which is its traditional source. It is a precursor to diverse fine chemicals. The mesityl group (Mes) is a substituent with the formula C6H2Me3 and is found in various other compounds. Preparation Mesitylene is prepared by equilibration of xylene (or simple methyl alkylation of it) over solid acid catalyst:Karl Griesbaum, Arno Behr, Dieter Biedenkapp, Heinz-Werner Voges, Dorothea Garbe, Christian Paetz, Gerd Collin, Dieter Mayer, Hartmut H√∂ke ‚ÄúHydrocarbons‚Äù in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002 Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. . :2 C6H4(CH3)2 ‚áå C6H3(CH3)3 \\\\+ C6H5CH3 :C6H4(CH3)2 \\\\+ CH3OH ‚Üí C6H3(CH3)3 \\\\+ H2O Trimerization of acetone via aldol condensation, which is catalyzed and dehydrated by sulfuric acid affords a mixture of 1,3,5- and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzenes. Reactions Oxidation of mesitylene with nitric acid affords trimesic acid, C6H3(COOH)3. Using manganese dioxide, a milder oxidising agent, 3,5-dimethylbenzaldehyde is formed. Mesitylene is oxidised by trifluoroperacetic acid to produce mesitol (2,4,6-trimethylphenol). Applications Mesitylene is mainly used as a precursor to 2,4,6-trimethylaniline, a precursor to colorants. This derivative is prepared by selective mononitration of mesitylene, avoiding oxidation of the methyl groups. Additive and component of some avgas (aviation gasoline) blends. =Niche uses= Structure of (mesitylene)molybdenum tricarbonyl, [(Œ∑6-C6H3Me3)Mo(CO)3] Mesitylene is used in the laboratory as a specialty solvent. It can also act as a ligand in organometallic chemistry, one example being the organomolybdenum complex which can be prepared from molybdenum hexacarbonyl. In the electronics industry, mesitylene has been used as a developer for photopatternable silicones due to its solvent properties. The three aromatic hydrogen atoms of mesitylene are in identical chemical shift environments. Therefore, they only give a single peak near 6.8 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum; the same is also true for the nine methyl protons, which give a singlet near 2.3 ppm. For this reason, mesitylene is sometimes used as an internal standard in NMR samples that contain aromatic protons.http://chemicalland21.com/industrialchem/organic/MESITYLENE.htm Uvitic acid is obtained by oxidizing mesitylene or by condensing pyruvic acid with baryta water. The Gattermann reaction can be simplified by replacing the HCN/AlCl3 combination with zinc cyanide (Zn(CN)2). Although it is highly toxic, Zn(CN)2 is a solid, making it safer to work with than gaseous hydrogen cyanide (HCN). The Zn(CN)2 reacts with the HCl to form the key HCN reactant and Zn(CN)2 that serves as the Lewis-acid catalyst in-situ. An example of the Zn(CN)2 method is the synthesis of mesitaldehyde from mesitylene. History Mesitylene was first prepared in 1837 by Robert Kane, an Irish chemist, by heating acetone with concentrated sulfuric acid.Robert Kane (1839) \\"On a series of combinations derived from pyroacetic spirit [acetone]\\" Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, vol. 18, pages 99‚Äì125. He named his new substance \\"mesitylene\\" because the German chemist Carl Reichenbach had named acetone \\"mesit\\" (from the Greek ŒºŒµœÉŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ, the mediator),Reichenbach's research is excerpted in: C. Reichenbach (1834) \\"Ueber Mesit (Essiggeist) und Holzgeist\\" (On mesit (spirit of vinegar) and wood spirits), Annalen der Pharmacie, vol. 10, no. 3, pages 298‚Äì314. and Kane believed that his reaction had dehydrated mesit, converting it to an alkene, \\"mesitylene\\".For an explanation of the original of the name \\"mesitylene\\", see also: Henry E. Roscoe, A Treatise on Chemistry (New York, New York: D. Appleton and Co., 1889), vol. III, page 102, footnote 2. However, Kane's determination of the chemical composition (\\"empirical formula\\") of mesitylene was incorrect. The correct empirical formula was provided by August W. von Hofmann in 1849.A.W. Hofmann (1849) \\"On the composition of mesitilole [mesitylene], and some of its derivatives\\", The Quarterly Journal of the Chemical Society of London, vol. 2, pages 104‚Äì115. (Note: The empirical formula of mesitylene as stated in Hofmann's paper ( C18H12 ) is incorrect; however, this happened because Hofmann used 6 as the atomic weight of carbon, instead of the correct atomic weight of 12. Once the correct atomic weight is used in Hofmann's calculations, his results give the correct empirical formula of C9H12.) In 1866 Adolf von Baeyer showed that mesitylene's structure was consistent with that of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene;Adolf von Baeyer (1866) \\"Ueber die Condensationsproducte des Acetons\\" (On condensation products of acetone), Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie, vol. 140, pages 297‚Äì306. however, conclusive proof that mesitylene was identical to 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene was provided by Albert Ladenburg in 1874.Albert Ladenburg (1874) \\"Ueber das Mesitylen\\" (On mesitylene), Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft, vol. 7, pages 1133‚Äì1137. Mesityl group The group (CH3)3C6H2\\\\- is called mesityl (organic group symbol: Mes). Mesityl derivatives, e.g. tetramesityldiiron, are typically prepared from the Grignard reagent (CH3)3C6H2MgBr. Due to its large steric demand, the mesityl group is used as a large blocking group in asymmetric catalysis (to enhance diastereo- or enantioselectivity) and organometallic chemistry (to stabilize low oxidation state or low coordination number metal centers). Larger analogues with even greater steric demand, for example 2,6-diisopropylphenyl (Dipp) and the analogously named Tripp ((iPr)3C6H2, Is) and supermesityl ((tBu)3C6H2, Mes*) groups, may be even more effective toward achieving these goals. Safety and the environment Mesitylene is also a major urban volatile organic compound (VOC) which results from combustion. It plays a significant role in aerosol and tropospheric ozone formation as well as other reactions in atmospheric chemistry.

It is also sometimes known as the United Nations Transitional Authority in Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium. UNTAES is one of only several UN missions in history which were established as transitional administrations with direct and highest executive powers. History =Pre-establishment events= Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia After Operation Storm in mid-1995, the only remaining part of the Republic of Serbian Krajina became that in the east, near the border with Yugoslavia. In context of successful military interventions Bljesak and Oluja, initial idea that the region of Eastern Slavonia will be integrated back to Croatia through the peaceful means was perceived with astonishment on Croatian side and as a form of pressure from the international community while the military establishment held informal talks about preparation of a military solution for the region under the code name ‚ÄúSkok u Dalj‚Äù (‚ÄúJump to Dalj‚Äù). There was lack of enthusiasm and belief that peaceful process will be successful among involved parties and other states in the region, themselves recently involved in Yugoslav Wars. The Erdut Agreement between the Croatian Government and the representatives of the Serbs in the region was signed in November 1995, which requested that the UN form a transitional authority and a peacekeeping force. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1023 supported that, and after the UNCRO mission was terminated in the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1025, UNTAES was set up to serve as a United Nations protectorate over the region in Resolution 1037. Reintegration of the region, the last part of the country outside the control of central government and arguably geopolitically the most sensitive part of former self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina, was the most important Croatian condition for participation in Dayton Peace Negotiations. The subsequent Dayton agreement for peace in Bosnia ended the deadliest conflicts of the Yugoslav wars. =Transitional Administration= thumbnail The transitional administration started its operations on January 15, 1996 with the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1043. It was meant to last for one year, with provision which permitted extension of mandate of up to one year if one of the sides ask so. Administration's main task was to monitor demilitarization and ensure peaceful reintegration of the territory into Croatia. UN Secretary General initially proposed that UNTAES should have 9,300 soldiers. By the final agreement the administration had a military and a civilian component with 5,000 soldiers, 500 UNTAES civilian police (UNCIVPOL) and 99 military observers. At its full deployment UNTAES consisted of 4849 soldiers, 99 military observers and 401 civil police members, close to the agreed number. Before the arrival of UNTAES troops in region has already been located 1,600 troops from Belgian and Russian Armed Forces under United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia. They were joined by Jordanian and Pakistani mechanized battalions, Ukrainian helicopter gunship and other units. United States took a dominant role in implementation of reintegration process. Strobe Talbott was one of the policy makers who raised the issue of regulation of position of Serbs in Croatia, the most important issue in Croatia‚ÄìUnited States relations at the time, while US Ambassador Peter Galbraith organized three meetings with the population of the region in the towns of Vukovar, Beli Manastir and Ilok where he informed local Serbs that they will, regardless of fact that their leaders didn‚Äôt inform them on it, indeed became part of Croatia based on Erdut Agreement. He also told them that they have the right to stay, and live whenever they want in Croatia, be it Zagreb, Osijek, Donji Lapac, Knin or Glina and that ethnic Croats have the right to return to Eastern Slavonia. Madeleine Albright visited Vukovar in early 1996 to express her support to the process of reintegration where she was attacked with eggs and stones at local market. Initial headquarters was located at United Nations Protection Force headquarters in Zagreb but idea of mission personnel was to put headquarters in eastern Croatia. Croatian Government offered Osijek for that purpose but mission refused it since it wanted to locate it on the territory of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia. Therefore, the headquarters were located in Vukovar, with a liaison office in Beli Manastir, which provided UNTAES civil affairs officers with the opportunity to attend sessions of local Serb Executive Councils and assemblies which facilitated exchange of relevant information. One of the challenges mission faced was tense and peaceful retake of ƒêeletovci oil fields from the control of Scorpions paramilitary. Representatives of mission urged ambassadors from Zagreb to visit region and additionally introduced practice of visiting of the local Serbian orthodox churches and two Catholic churches that still were in operation. On 13th of April 1997 UNTAES facilitated the conduct of Croatian Chamber of Counties election in region and on that occasion special US mission under Nancy Ely-Raphael leadership visited Vukovar. US special mission visited Sarva≈°, Erdut, Dalj, Vukovar, Borovo, Lovas, Opatovac, Ilok, ≈†arengrad, Bilje, ƒåeminac, Beli Manastir and Kne≈æevi Vinogradi. US mission gave its thanks to Croatian authorities for enabling Serb population with missing Croatian documents to vote and to local Serbian executive committee presided by Vojislav Stanimiroviƒá for motivating local Serb population to take part in Croatian elections. Mission once more underlined that the goal of Erdut Agreement to re-establish multi-ethnic region in Croatian Podunavlje. Local police reform One of the main tasks of UNTAES was reform of local police forces in which before the war occurred first inter-ethnic conflicts (see:Battle of Borovo Selo). UNTAES initial problem was to replacement of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia symbols. Since there was resistance to that, compromise was reached where UNTAES with financial support of US Department of Justice bought uniforms without any state features. Croatian government initially refused to begin paying salaries to local police but later agreed to do so since it showed return of Croatian sovereignty and responsibility for region. Second problem was the fact that Croatian government refused to pay salaries in Yugoslav dinar while local police didn't want it in Croatian kuna so in the end it was paid in Deutsche Mark. Management of transitional police forces was functioning on the basis of dualism where on each top position in the region there were two individuals, one from Croatian and one from Serbian community, including double commanders of police forces. Support for UNTAES was provided by Polish Special Police Group that made first arrest of an indicated war criminal who was former mayor of Vukovar. Administration's extensions * in July 1996 with the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1069 * in November 1996 with the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1079 * in July 1997 with the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1120 =Subsequent events= The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1145 in late 1997 arranged for the United Nations Police Support Group (UNPSG) to take over UNTAES' policing tasks, effectively concluding the UNTAES mission on January 15, 1998. A support group of 180 civilian UN police officers remained to monitor the progress of the Croatian police and oversee the return of the refugees. As additional help to UNTAES mission, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe established OSCE Mission to Croatia whose tasks was to overlook of respect of human and minority rights, return of refugees, formation of public institutions and monitoring of work of civil police.

The Dalkon Shield was a contraceptive intrauterine device (IUD) developed by the Dalkon Corporation and marketed by the A.H. Robins Company. The Dalkon Shield was found to cause severe injury to a disproportionately large percentage of its users, which eventually led to numerous lawsuits, in which juries awarded millions of dollars in compensatory and punitive damages.  History  In 1970, the A.H. Robins Company acquired the Dalkon Shield from the Dalkon Corporation, founded by Hugh J. Davis, M.D. The Dalkon Corporation had only four shareholders: the inventors Davis and Irwin Lerner, their attorney Robert Cohn, and Thad J. Earl, M.D., a medical practitioner in Defiance, Ohio. In 1971, Dalkon Shield went into the market, beginning in the United States and Puerto Rico, spearheaded by a large marketing campaign. At its peak, about 2.8 million women used the Dalkon Shield in the U.S. At the time of its introduction, the Dalkon Shield was promoted as a safer alternative compared to birth control pills, which at the time were the subject of many safety concerns. Initial reports in the medical literature raised questions about whether its efficacy in preventing pregnancy and expulsion rate were as good as those claimed by the manufacturer, but failed to detect the tendency of the device to cause septic abortion and other severe infections. In June 1973, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted a survey of 34,544 physicians with practices in gynecology or obstetrics regarding women who had been hospitalized or had died with complications related to the use of an IUD in the previous 6 months. A total of 16,994 physicians responded, yielding 3,502 unique case reports of women hospitalized in the first 6 months of 1973. Based on the survey response rate, the CDC estimated that a total of 7,900 IUD related hospitalizations occurred during this 6-month period. Based on an estimate of 3.2 million IUD users, the CDC estimated an annual device-related hospitalization rate of 5 per 1000 IUD users. The survey also provided 5 reports of device-related fatalities, with four of these related to severe infection. One of the five was associated with the Dalkon Shield. Based on these data, the CDC estimated an IUD-related fatality rate of 3 per million users per year of use, which it compared favorably to the mortality risks associated with pregnancy and other forms of contraception. Importantly, the survey showed that the Dalkon Shield was associated with an increased rate of pregnancy-associated complications leading to hospitalization. By 1974, approximately 2.5 million women had received the Dalkon intrauterine device. In June of that year, the medical director of A.H. Robins published a letter to the editor of the British Medical Journal stating that the company was aware of an \\"apparent increase in the number of cases of septic abortions\\" including 4 fatalities, but stating that \\"there is no evidence of a direct cause-and-effect relationship between wearing of the Dalkon Shield and the occurrence of septicemia\\". The letter recommended precautions including pregnancy tests for women who missed their period and immediate removal of the device in women who were found to be pregnant. In October 1974, a series of four case reports of septic pregnancies was published in the journal Obstretics and Gynecology\\". In 1975, the CDC published a study associating the Dalkon Shield with a higher risk of spontaneous abortion-related death compared to other IUDs. As many as 200,000 women made claims against the A.H. Robins company, mostly related to claims associated with pelvic inflammatory disease and loss of fertility. The company eventually filed for bankruptcy. The company's representatives argued that pelvic infections have a wide variety of causes, and that the Dalkon Shield was no more dangerous than other forms of birth control. Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that the women they represented would be healthy and fertile today if not for the device. Scientists from the CDC stated that both arguments have merit.  Aftermath  More than 300,000 lawsuits were filed against the A.H. Robins Company ‚Äì the largest tort liability case since asbestos. The federal judge, Miles W. Lord, attracted public commentary for his judgments, impositions of personal liability, and public rebukes of the company heads.Time Magazine, ‚ÄúA Panel Tries to Judge a Judge‚Äù, Jul. 23, 1984, By MICHAEL S. SERRILL The cost of litigation and settlements (estimated at billions of dollars) led the company to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1985. As a result, Robins sold the company to American Home Products (now Wyeth). In 1976, the Medical Device Amendments to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act mandated the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for the first time, to require testing and approval of \\"medical devices\\", including IUDs. The Dalkon Shield became infamous for its serious design flaw: a porous, multifilament string upon which bacteria could travel into the uterus of users, leading to sepsis, injury, miscarriage, and death. Modern intrauterine devices (IUDs) use monofilament strings, which do not pose this grave risk to users.

Therefore, this is an Eulerian graph. Following the edges in alphabetical order gives an Eulerian circuit/cycle. In graph theory, an Eulerian trail (or Eulerian path) is a trail in a finite graph that visits every edge exactly once (allowing for revisiting vertices). Similarly, an Eulerian circuit or Eulerian cycle is an Eulerian trail that starts and ends on the same vertex. They were first discussed by Leonhard Euler while solving the famous Seven Bridges of K√∂nigsberg problem in 1736. The problem can be stated mathematically like this: :Given the graph in the image, is it possible to construct a path (or a cycle; i.e., a path starting and ending on the same vertex) that visits each edge exactly once? Euler proved that a necessary condition for the existence of Eulerian circuits is that all vertices in the graph have an even degree, and stated without proof that connected graphs with all vertices of even degree have an Eulerian circuit. The first complete proof of this latter claim was published posthumously in 1873 by Carl Hierholzer.N. L. Biggs, E. K. Lloyd and R. J. Wilson, Graph Theory, 1736‚Äì1936, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1976, 8‚Äì9, . This is known as Euler's Theorem: :A connected graph has an Euler cycle if and only if every vertex has even degree. The term Eulerian graph has two common meanings in graph theory. One meaning is a graph with an Eulerian circuit, and the other is a graph with every vertex of even degree. These definitions coincide for connected graphs. For the existence of Eulerian trails it is necessary that zero or two vertices have an odd degree; this means the K√∂nigsberg graph is not Eulerian. If there are no vertices of odd degree, all Eulerian trails are circuits. If there are exactly two vertices of odd degree, all Eulerian trails start at one of them and end at the other. A graph that has an Eulerian trail but not an Eulerian circuit is called semi-Eulerian. Definition An Eulerian trail,Some people reserve the terms path and cycle to mean non-self- intersecting path and cycle. A (potentially) self-intersecting path is known as a trail or an open walk; and a (potentially) self-intersecting cycle, a circuit or a closed walk. This ambiguity can be avoided by using the terms Eulerian trail and Eulerian circuit when self-intersection is allowed. or Euler walk in an undirected graph is a walk that uses each edge exactly once. If such a walk exists, the graph is called traversable or semi-eulerian.Jun- ichi Yamaguchi, Introduction of Graph Theory. An Eulerian cycle, Eulerian circuit or Euler tour in an undirected graph is a cycle that uses each edge exactly once. If such a cycle exists, the graph is called Eulerian or unicursal.Schaum's outline of theory and problems of graph theory By V. K. Balakrishnan . The term \\"Eulerian graph\\" is also sometimes used in a weaker sense to denote a graph where every vertex has even degree. For finite connected graphs the two definitions are equivalent, while a possibly unconnected graph is Eulerian in the weaker sense if and only if each connected component has an Eulerian cycle. For directed graphs, \\"path\\" has to be replaced with directed path and \\"cycle\\" with directed cycle. The definition and properties of Eulerian trails, cycles and graphs are valid for multigraphs as well. An Eulerian orientation of an undirected graph G is an assignment of a direction to each edge of G such that, at each vertex v, the indegree of v equals the outdegree of v. Such an orientation exists for any undirected graph in which every vertex has even degree, and may be found by constructing an Euler tour in each connected component of G and then orienting the edges according to the tour.. Every Eulerian orientation of a connected graph is a strong orientation, an orientation that makes the resulting directed graph strongly connected.  Properties  *An undirected graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if every vertex has even degree, and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single connected component. *An undirected graph can be decomposed into edge-disjoint cycles if and only if all of its vertices have even degree. So, a graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if it can be decomposed into edge-disjoint cycles and its nonzero-degree vertices belong to a single connected component. *An undirected graph has an Eulerian trail if and only if exactly zero or two vertices have odd degree, and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single connected component. *A directed graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if every vertex has equal in degree and out degree, and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single strongly connected component. Equivalently, a directed graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if it can be decomposed into edge-disjoint directed cycles and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single strongly connected component. *A directed graph has an Eulerian trail if and only if at most one vertex has (out-degree) ‚àí (in-degree) = 1, at most one vertex has (in-degree) ‚àí (out-degree) = 1, every other vertex has equal in-degree and out-degree, and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single connected component of the underlying undirected graph.  Constructing Eulerian trails and circuits  = Fleury's algorithm = Fleury's algorithm is an elegant but inefficient algorithm that dates to 1883.. Consider a graph known to have all edges in the same component and at most two vertices of odd degree. The algorithm starts at a vertex of odd degree, or, if the graph has none, it starts with an arbitrarily chosen vertex. At each step it chooses the next edge in the path to be one whose deletion would not disconnect the graph, unless there is no such edge, in which case it picks the remaining edge left at the current vertex. It then moves to the other endpoint of that edge and deletes the edge. At the end of the algorithm there are no edges left, and the sequence from which the edges were chosen forms an Eulerian cycle if the graph has no vertices of odd degree, or an Eulerian trail if there are exactly two vertices of odd degree. While the graph traversal in Fleury's algorithm is linear in the number of edges, i.e. O(E), we also need to factor in the complexity of detecting bridges. If we are to re-run Tarjan's linear time bridge-finding algorithm. after the removal of every edge, Fleury's algorithm will have a time complexity of O(E^2). A dynamic bridge-finding algorithm of allows this to be improved to O(E \\\\cdot \\\\log^3 E \\\\cdot \\\\log \\\\log E), but this is still significantly slower than alternative algorithms. = Hierholzer's algorithm = Hierholzer's 1873 paper provides a different method for finding Euler cycles that is more efficient than Fleury's algorithm: *Choose any starting vertex v, and follow a trail of edges from that vertex until returning to v. It is not possible to get stuck at any vertex other than v, because the even degree of all vertices ensures that, when the trail enters another vertex w there must be an unused edge leaving w. The tour formed in this way is a closed tour, but may not cover all the vertices and edges of the initial graph. *As long as there exists a vertex u that belongs to the current tour but that has adjacent edges not part of the tour, start another trail from u, following unused edges until returning to u, and join the tour formed in this way to the previous tour. *Since we assume the original graph is connected, repeating the previous step will exhaust all edges of the graph. By using a data structure such as a doubly linked list to maintain the set of unused edges incident to each vertex, to maintain the list of vertices on the current tour that have unused edges, and to maintain the tour itself, the individual operations of the algorithm (finding unused edges exiting each vertex, finding a new starting vertex for a tour, and connecting two tours that share a vertex) may be performed in constant time each, so the overall algorithm takes linear time, O(E).. This algorithm may also be implemented with a queue. Because it is only possible to get stuck when the queue represents a closed tour, one should rotate the queue (remove an element from the head and add it to the tail) until unstuck, and continue until all edges are accounted for. This also takes linear time, as the number of rotations performed is never larger than E. Counting Eulerian circuits = Complexity issues = The number of Eulerian circuits in digraphs can be calculated using the so-called BEST theorem, named after de Bruijn, van Aardenne-Ehrenfest, Smith and Tutte. The formula states that the number of Eulerian circuits in a digraph is the product of certain degree factorials and the number of rooted arborescences. The latter can be computed as a determinant, by the matrix tree theorem, giving a polynomial time algorithm. BEST theorem is first stated in this form in a \\"note added in proof\\" to the Aardenne-Ehrenfest and de Bruijn paper (1951). The original proof was bijective and generalized the de Bruijn sequences. It is a variation on an earlier result by Smith and Tutte (1941). Counting the number of Eulerian circuits on undirected graphs is much more difficult. This problem is known to be #P-complete.Brightwell and Winkler, \\"Note on Counting Eulerian Circuits\\", 2004. In a positive direction, a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach, via the Kotzig transformations (introduced by Anton Kotzig in 1968) is believed to give a sharp approximation for the number of Eulerian circuits in a graph, though as yet there is no proof of this fact (even for graphs of bounded degree). = Special cases = The asymptotic formula for the number of Eulerian circuits in the complete graphs was determined by McKay and Robinson (1995):Brendan McKay and Robert W. Robinson, Asymptotic enumeration of eulerian circuits in the complete graph, Combinatorica, 10 (1995), no. 4, 367‚Äì377. : \\\\operatorname{ec}(K_n) = 2^{(n+1)/2}\\\\pi^{1/2} e^{-n^2/2+11/12} n^{(n-2)(n+1)/2} \\\\bigl(1+O(n^{-1/2+\\\\epsilon})\\\\bigr). A similar formula was later obtained by M.I. Isaev (2009) for complete bipartite graphs: : \\\\operatorname{ec}(K_{n,n}) = (n/2-1)!^{2n} 2^{n^2-n+1/2}\\\\pi^{-n+1/2} n^{n-1} \\\\bigl(1+O(n^{-1/2+\\\\epsilon})\\\\bigr).  Applications  Haus vom Nikolaus puzzle has two odd vertices, the path must start at one and end at the other. 2\\\\. Annie Pope's with four odd vertices has no solution. 3\\\\. If there are no odd vertices, the path can start anywhere and forms a closed circuit. 4\\\\. Loose ends are considered vertices of degree 1. Eulerian trails are used in bioinformatics to reconstruct the DNA sequence from its fragments. They are also used in CMOS circuit design to find an optimal logic gate ordering. There are some algorithms for processing trees that rely on an Euler tour of the tree (where each edge is treated as a pair of arcs). The de Bruijn sequences can be constructed as Eulerian trails of de Bruijn graphs. In infinite graphs An infinite graph with all vertex degrees equal to four but with no Eulerian line In an infinite graph, the corresponding concept to an Eulerian trail or Eulerian cycle is an Eulerian line, a doubly-infinite trail that covers all of the edges of the graph. It is not sufficient for the existence of such a trail that the graph be connected and that all vertex degrees be even; for instance, the infinite Cayley graph shown, with all vertex degrees equal to four, has no Eulerian line. The infinite graphs that contain Eulerian lines were characterized by . For an infinite graph or multigraph to have an Eulerian line, it is necessary and sufficient that all of the following conditions be met:.. * is connected. * has countable sets of vertices and edges. * has no vertices of (finite) odd degree. *Removing any finite subgraph from leaves at most two infinite connected components in the remaining graph, and if has even degree at each of its vertices then removing leaves exactly one infinite connected component.

The secularization thesis expresses the idea that as societies progress, particularly through modernization and rationalization, religious authority diminishes in all aspects of social life and governance.\\"The Secularization Debate\\", chapter 1 (pp. 3-32) of As a second meaning, the term \\"secularization\\" may also occur in the context of the lifting of monastic restrictions from a member of the clergy. Secularization, in the main, sociological meaning of the term, involves the historical process in which religion loses social and cultural significance. As a result of secularization the role of religion in modern societies becomes restricted. In secularized societies faith lacks cultural authority, and religious organizations have little social power. Secularization has many levels of meaning, both as a theory and as a historical process. Social theorists such as Karl Marx (1818‚Äì1883), Sigmund Freud (1856‚Äì1939), Max Weber (1864‚Äì1920), and √âmile Durkheim (1858‚Äì1917) postulated that the modernization of society would include a decline in levels of religiosity. Study of this process seeks to determine the manner in which, or extent to which religious creeds, practices and institutions are losing social significance. Some theorists argue that the secularization of modern civilization partly results from our inability to adapt broad ethical and spiritual needs of mankind to the increasingly fast advance of the physical sciences.See text In contrast to the \\"modernization\\" thesis, Christian Smith and others argue that intellectual and cultural √©lites promote secularization to enhance their own status and influence. Smith believes that intellectuals have an inherent tendency to be hostile to their native cultures, causing them to embrace secularism.Smith, Christian. The Secular Revolution: Powers, Interests, and Conflicts in the Secularization of American Public Life (2012) The term \\"secularization\\" also has additional meanings, primarily historical and religious.Casanova, Jose (1994). Public Religions in the Modern World. University of Chicago Press, pg. 13. Applied to church property, historically it refers to the seizure of church lands and buildings, such as Henry VIII's 16th-century dissolution of the monasteries in England and the later acts during the 18th-century French Revolution, as well as by various anti-clerical enlightened absolutist European governments during the 18th and 19th centuries, which resulted in the expulsion and suppression of the religious communities which occupied them. The 19th-century Kulturkampf in Germany and Switzerland and similar events in many other countries also were expressions of secularization.Gould, Andrew in: Origins of Liberal Dominance: State, Church, and Party in Nineteenth-century Europe, University of Michigan Press, 1999, p. 82, Still another form of secularization refers to the act of Prince-Bishops or holders of a position in a Monastic or Military Order - holding a combined religious and secular authority under the Catholic Church - who broke away and made themselves into completely secular (typically, Protestant) hereditary rulers. For example, Gotthard Kettler (1517‚Äì1587), the last Master of the Livonian Order, converted to Lutheranism, secularised (and took to himself) the lands of Semigallia and Courland which he had held on behalf of the order - which enabled him to marry and leave to his descendants the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia. The 1960s saw a trend toward increasing secularization in Western Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. This transformation accompanied major social factors: economic prosperity, youth rebelling against the rules and conventions of society, women's liberation, radical theology, and radical politics. Jeffrey Cox, \\"Secularization and other master narratives of religion in modern Europe.\\" Kirchliche Zeitgeschichte (2001): 24-35. Background Secularization is sometimes credited both to the cultural shifts in society following the emergence of rationality and the development of science as a substitute for superstition‚ÄîMax Weber called this process the \\"disenchantment of the world\\"‚Äîand to the changes made by religious institutions to compensate. At the most basic stages, this begins with a slow transition from oral traditions to a writing culture that diffuses knowledge. This first reduces the authority of clerics as the custodians of revealed knowledge. The shift of responsibility for education from the family and community to the state has had two consequences: * Collective conscience as defined by Durkheim is diminished; * Religion becomes a matter of individual choice rather than an observed social obligation. A major issue in the study of secularization is the extent to which certain trends such as decreased attendance at places of worship indicate a decrease in religiosity or simply a privatization of religious belief, where religious beliefs no longer play a dominant role in public life or in other aspects of decision making. The issue of secularization is discussed in various religious traditions. The government of Turkey is an often cited example, following the abolition of the Ottoman Caliphate and the founding of the Turkish republic in 1923. This established popular sovereignty in a secular republican framework, in opposition to a system whose authority is based on religion. As one of many examples of state modernization, this shows secularization and democratization as mutually reinforcing processes , relying on a separation of religion and state. In expressly secular states like India, it has been argued that the need was to legislate for toleration and respect between quite different religions, and that the secularization of the West was a response to drastically violent intra-Christian feuds between Catholicism and Protestantism. Some have therefore argued that Western and Indian secularization is radically different in that it deals with autonomy from religious regulation and control. Considerations of both tolerance and autonomy are relevant to any secular state. Definitions C. John Sommerville (1998) outlined six uses of the term secularization in the scientific literature. The first five are more along the lines of 'definitions' while the sixth is more of a 'clarification of use':Somerville, C. J. \\"Secular Society Religious Population: Our Tacit Rules for Using the Term Secularization. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion 37 (2):249-53. (1998) # When discussing macro social structures, secularization can refer to differentiation: a process in which the various aspects of society, economic, political, legal, and moral, become increasingly specialized and distinct from one another. # When discussing individual institutions, secularization can denote the transformation of a religious into a secular institution. Examples would be the evolution of institutions such as Harvard University from a predominantly religious institution into a secular institution (with a divinity school now housing the religious element illustrating differentiation). # When discussing activities, secularization refers to the transfer of activities from religious to secular institutions, such as a shift in provision of social services from churches to the government. # When discussing mentalities, secularization refers to the transition from ultimate concerns to proximate concerns. E.g., individuals in the West are now more likely to moderate their behavior in response to more immediately applicable consequences rather than out of concern for post-mortem consequences. This is a personal religious decline or movement toward a secular lifestyle. # When discussing populations, secularization refers to broad patterns of societal decline in levels of religiosity as opposed to the individual-level secularization of (4) above. This understanding of secularization is also distinct from (1) above in that it refers specifically to religious decline rather than societal differentiation. # When discussing religion, secularization can only be used unambiguously to refer to religion in a generic sense. For example, a reference to Christianity is not clear unless one specifies exactly which denominations of Christianity are being discussed. Abdel Wahab Elmessiri (2002) outlined two meanings of the term secularization: # Partial Secularization: which is the common meaning of the word, and expresses \\"The separation between religion and state\\". # Complete Secularization: this definition is not limited to the partial definition, but exceeds it to \\"The separation between all (religion, moral, and human) values, and (not just the state) but also to (the human nature in its public and private sides), so that the holiness is removed from the world, and this world is transformed into a usable matter that can be employed for the sake of the strong\\". Sociological use and differentiation As studied by sociologists, one of the major themes of secularization is that of \\"differentiation\\"‚Äîi.e., the tendency for areas of life to become more distinct and specialized as a society becomes modernized. European sociology, influenced by anthropology, was interested in the process of change from the so-called primitive societies to increasingly advanced societies. In the United States, the emphasis was initially on change as an aspect of progress, but Talcott Parsons refocused on society as a system immersed in a constant process of increased differentiation, which he saw as a process in which new institutions take over the tasks necessary in a society to guarantee its survival as the original monolithic institutions break up. This is a devolution from single, less differentiated institutions to an increasingly differentiated subset of institutions.Martin, David (2005). On Secularization: Toward a Revised General Theory. Ashgate Publishing Company, p. 20. (\\"Parsons saw differentiation as the separating out of each social sphere from ecclesiastical control: the state, science, and the market, but also law, welfare, and education etc.\\") Following Parsons, this concept of differentiation has been widely applied. As phrased by Jos√© Casanova, this \\"core and the central thesis of the theory of secularization is the conceptualization of the process of societal modernization as a process of functional differentiation and emancipation of the secular spheres‚Äîprimarily the state, the economy, and science‚Äîfrom the religious sphere and the concomitant differentiation and specialization of religion within its own newly found religious sphere\\". Casanova also describes this as the theory of \\"privatization\\" of religion, which he partially criticizes.Casanova, Jose (1994). Public Religions in the Modern World. University of Chicago Press, p. 19. (\\"Only in the 1980s, after the sudden eruption of religion into the public sphere, did it become obvious that differentiation and the loss of societal functions do not necessarily entail 'privatization.'\\") While criticizing certain aspects of the traditional sociological theory of secularization, however, David Martin argues that the concept of social differentiation has been its \\"most useful element\\".Martin, p. 20. Current issues in secularization At present, secularization as understood in the West is being debated in the sociology of religion. In his works Legitimacy of the Modern Age (1966) and The Genesis of the Copernican World (1975), Hans Blumenberg has rejected the idea of a historical continuity ‚Äì fundamental to the so-called 'theorem of secularization'; the Modern age in his view represents an independent epoch opposed to Antiquity and the Middle Ages by a rehabilitation of human curiosity in reaction to theological absolutism. \\"Blumenberg targets L√∂with's argument that progress is the secularization of Hebrew and Christian beliefs and argues to the contrary that the modern age, including its belief in progress, grew out of a new secular self-affirmation of culture against the Christian tradition.\\" Wolfhart Pannenberg, a student of L√∂with, has continued the debate against Blumenberg. Charles Taylor in \\"A Secular Age\\" challenges what he calls 'the subtraction thesis' ‚Äì that science leads to religion being subtracted from more and more areas of life. Proponents of \\"secularization theory\\" demonstrate widespread declines in the prevalence of religious belief throughout the West, particularly in Europe.Bruce, Steve. God is Dead: Secularization in the West. (2002) Some scholars (e.g., Rodney Stark, Peter Berger) have argued that levels of religiosity are not declining, while other scholars (e.g., Mark Chaves, N. J. Demerath) have countered by introducing the idea of neo- secularization, which broadens the definition of secularization to include the decline of religious authority and its ability to influence society. In other words, rather than using the proportion of irreligious apostates as the sole measure of secularity, neo-secularization argues that individuals increasingly look outside of religion for authoritative positions. Neo-secularizationists would argue that religion has diminishing authority on issues such as birth control, and argue that religion's authority is declining and secularization is taking place even if religious affiliation may not be declining in the United States (a debate still taking place).Rick Phillips, Can Rising Rates of Church Participation be a Consequence of Secularization?, Sociology of Religion, Volume 65, Issue 2, Summer 2004, Pages 139‚Äì153, https://doi.org/10.2307/3712403 Finally, some claim that demographic forces offset the process of secularization, and may do so to such an extent that individuals can consistently drift away from religion even as society becomes more religious. This is especially the case in societies like Israel (with the ultra-Orthodox and religious Zionists) where committed religious groups have several times the birth rate of seculars. The religious fertility effect operates to a greater or lesser extent in all countries, and is amplified in the West by religious immigration. For instance, even as native whites became more secular, London, England, has become more religious in the past 25 years as religious immigrants and their descendants have increased their share of the population.Kaufmann, Eric. 2011. Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth: Demography and Politics in the Twenty-First Century. London: Profile Books. Also see www.sneps.net . Across the board, the question of secularization has generated considerable (and occasionally heated) debates in the social sciences. Regional developments  =United States= 1870-1930. Christian Smith examined the secularization of American public life between 1870 and 1930. He noted that in 1870 a Protestant establishment thoroughly dominated American culture and its public institutions. By the turn of the 20th century, however, positivism had displaced the Baconian method (which had hitherto bolstered natural theology) and higher education had been thoroughly secularized. In the 1910s \\"legal realism\\" gained prominence, de-emphasizing the religious basis for law. That same decade publishing houses emerged that were independent of the Protestant establishment. During the 1920s secularization extended into popular culture and mass public education ceased to be under Protestant cultural influence. Although the general public was still highly religious during this time period, by 1930 the old Protestant establishment was in \\"shambles\\".Smith, Christian. The Secular Revolution: Powers, Interests, and Conflicts in the Secularization of American Public Life (2012) pp.25-28 Key to understanding the secularization, Smith argues, was the rise of an elite intellectual class skeptical of religious orthodoxies and influenced by the European Enlightenment tradition. They consciously sought to displace a Protestant establishment they saw as standing in their way.Smith, Christian. The Secular Revolution: Powers, Interests, and Conflicts in the Secularization of American Public Life (2012) pp.32-43 2008-2017. Annual Gallup polls from 2008 through 2015 showed that the fraction of American who did not identify with any particular religion steadily rose from 14.6% in 2008 to 19.6% in 2015. At the same time, the fraction of Americans identifying as Christians sank from 80.1% to 75% during the same time. This trend continued until 2017 when 21.3% of Americans declared no religious identity. Given that non-Christian religions stayed roughly the same (at about 5% from 2008 to 2015) secularization seems to have affected primarily Christians. =Britain= History In Britain, secularization came much later than in most of Western Europe. It began in the 1960s as part of a much larger social and cultural revolution. Until then the postwar years had seen a revival of religiosity in Britain.Callum G. Brown, The Death of Christian Britain: Understanding Secularisation, 1800-2000 (2009) pp 170-92. Sociologists and historians have engaged in vigorous debates over when it started, how fast it happened, and what caused it.Jeremy Morris, \\"Secularization and religious experience: arguments in the historiography of modern British religion.\\" Historical Journal 55#1 (2012): 195-219. Sponsorship by royalty, aristocracy, and influential local gentry provided an important support-system for organized religion. The sponsorship faded away in the 20th century, as the local √©lites were no longer so powerful or so financially able to subsidize their favourite activities. In coal-mining districts, local collieries typically funded local chapels, but that ended as the industry grew distressed and the unionized miners rejected √©lite interference in their local affairs. This allowed secularizing forces to gain strength.Steve Bruce, \\"Patronage and secularization: social obligation and church support Patronage and secularization: social obligation and church support,\\" British Journal of Sociology (2012) 63#3 pp 533-552. Recent developments Data from the annual British Social Attitudes survey and the biennial European Social Survey suggest that the proportion of Britons who identify as Christian fell from 55% (in 1983) to 43% (in 2015). While members of non-Christian religions ‚Äì principally Muslims and Hindus ‚Äì quadrupled, the non-religious (\\"nones\\") now make up 53% of the British population. More than six in 10 ‚Äúnones‚Äù were brought up as Christians, mainly Anglican or Catholic. Only 2% of ‚Äúnones‚Äù were raised in religions other than Christian. People who were brought up to practise a religion, but who now identifies as having no religion, so-called \\"non-verts\\", had different \\"non-version\\" rates, namely 14% for Jews, 10% for Muslims and Sikhs and 6% for Hindus. The proportions of the non-religious who convert to a faith are small: 3% now identify as Anglicans, less than 0.5% convert to Catholicism, 2% join other Christian denominations and 2% convert to non-Christian faiths. =Asia=  India  Hinduism, which is the dominant way of life in India, has been described as a 'culture and civilisation of ancient origin' that is 'intrinsically secular'. India, post- independence, has seen the emergence of an assertive secular state.  China  One traditional view of Chinese culture sees the teachings of Confucianism - influential over many centuries - as basically secular. Chang Pao-min summarises perceived historical consequences of very early secularization in China: > The early secularization of Chinese society, which must be recognized as a > sign of modernity [...] has ironically left China for centuries without a > powerful and stable source of morality and law. All this simply means that > the pursuit of wealth or power or simply the competition for survival can be > and often has been ruthless without any sense of restraint. [...] Along with > the early secularization of Chinese society which was equally early, the > concomitant demise of feudalism and hereditary aristocracy, another > remarkable development, transformed China earlier than any other country > into a unitary system politically, with one single power centre. It also > rendered Chinese society much more egalitarian than Western Europe and > Japan. quoted in: In this arguably secular setting, the Chinese Communist Party r√©gime of the People's Republic of China (in power on the Chinese mainland from 1949) promoted deliberate secularization. See for example: = Arab world = Many countries in the Arab world show signs of increasing secularization. For instance, in Egypt, support for imposing sharia (Islamic law) fell from 84% in 2011 to 34% in 2016. Egyptians also pray less: among older Egyptians (55+) 90% prayed daily in 2011. Among the younger generation (age 18-24) that fraction was only 70%. By contrast, in 2016 these numbers had fallen to <80% (55+) and <40% (18-24). The other age groups were in between these values. In Lebanon and Morocco, the number of people listening to daily recitals of the Quran fell by half from 2011 to 2016. Some of these developments seem to be driven by need, e.g. by stagnating incomes which force women to contribute to household income and therefore to work. High living costs delay marriage and, as a consequence, seem to encourage pre-marital sex. However, in other countries, such as Jordan and Palestine, support for sharia and Islamist ideas seems to grow. Even in countries in which secularization is growing, there are backlashes. For instance, the president of Egypt, Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, has banned hundreds of newspapers and websites who may provoke opposition.

The term served to distinguish those who were captains by rank from: * Officers in command of a naval vessel, who were (and still are) addressed as captain regardless of rank; * Commanders, who received the title of captain as a courtesy, whether they currently had a command or not (e.g. the fictional Captain Jack Aubrey in Master and Commander or the fictional Captain Horatio Hornblower in Hornblower and the Hotspur); this custom is now defunct. In the Royal Navy of the 18th and 19th centuries, an officer might be promoted from commander to captain, but not have a command. Until the officer obtained a command, he was \\"on the beach\\" and on half-pay. An officer \\"took post\\" or was \\"made post\\" when he was first commissioned to command a vessel. Usually this was a rated vessel ‚Äì that is, a ship too important to be commanded by a mere commander ‚Äì but was occasionally an unrated one. Once a captain was given a command, his name was \\"posted\\" in The London Gazette. Being \\"made post\\" is portrayed as the most crucial event in an officer's career in both Forester's Horatio Hornblower series and O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series. Once an officer was promoted to post-captain, further promotion was strictly by seniority; if he could avoid death or disgrace, he would eventually become an admiral (even if only a yellow admiral). A junior post-captain would usually command a frigate or a comparable ship, while more senior post-captains would command larger ships. An exception to this rule was that a very junior post-captain could be posted to command an admiral's flagship, which was almost always a large ship of the line. The admiral would usually do this to keep his most junior captain under close observation and subject to his direct supervision. Captains commanding an admiral's flagship were called \\"flag captains\\". One example of this is the appointment of Alexander Hood to the command of HMS Barfleur, flagship of his brother, Admiral Sir Samuel Hood. Sometimes, a high-ranking admiral would have two post-captains on his flagship. The junior would serve as the flag captain and retain responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the vessel. The senior would be the fleet captain, or \\"captain of the fleet\\", and would serve as the admiral's chief-of-staff. These two captains would be listed in the ship's roll as the \\"second captain\\" and \\"first captain\\", respectively. After 1795, when they were first introduced on Royal Navy uniforms, the number and position of epaulettes distinguished between commanders and post-captains of various seniorities. A commander wore a single epaulette on the left shoulder. A post-captain with less than three years seniority wore a single epaulette on the right shoulder, and a post-captain with three or more years seniority wore an epaulette on each shoulder. In the O'Brian series, Aubrey \\"wets the swab\\" ‚Äì that is, he celebrates his promotion to commander and the acquisition of his \\"swab\\" or epaulette with the consumption of copious amounts of alcohol. Note that the term was descriptive only: no one was ever styled \\"Post-Captain John Smith\\".

It is the second airport of Sicily in terms of passengers after Catania-Fontanarossa Airport, with 7.018.087 passengers handled in 2019. History Apron view Aerial view =Early years= GESAP S.p.a. is the airport management company of \\"Falcone Borsellino\\" Airport in Palermo. It has a fully paid-up share capital of ‚Ç¨15,912,332 divided between the Regional Province of Palermo, the Comune of Palermo, the Chamber of Commerce, the Comune of Cinisi and other minor partners. Established in 1985, until 1994 GESAP operated exclusively as handler and supplier of ground services for Palermo Airport, the management of which is directly assigned by the government and overseen by the District Airport Directorate. The airport was given the name Falcone Borsellino in memory of the two leading anti-mafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino who were murdered by the Sicilian Mafia in 1992. A diameter plaque featuring their portraits can be found to the right of one of the main outside entrances to the departure hall, set into a mosaic of Sicily. Created by the Sicilian sculptor Tommaso Geraci, it bears the inscription Giovanni Falcone‚ÄìPaolo Borsellino‚ÄìGli Altri‚ÄìL'orgoglio della Nuova Sicilia (Giovanni Falcone‚ÄìPaolo Borsellino‚ÄìThe Others‚ÄìThe Pride of the New Sicily). In 1994, GESAP was charged with the partial management of the airport through a convention which granted the company a 20-year mandate to run land-side activities (the airport buildings and surrounding areas). In April 1999, GESAP obtained an anticipated mandate to manage the airport's air side activities, and, more specifically, the flight infrastructure (runways, links, taxiways and aprons) as foreseen by art. 17 L. 135/97. As airport management company, GESAP plans, creates and manages the airport's areas, infrastructures and systems, ensuring the necessary maintenance and implementation of the same. It also provides centralised services such as airport coordination, public information systems, security controls and surveillance as well as managing commercial outlets through concessions to third parties. =Development since the 2000s= In April 2004, GESAP was awarded UNI ISO 9001/2000 (Vision 2000) certification. The company had already received certification for its services and processes in the handling sector and this too was renewed by the certification body, T√úV, in December 2006. On 30 May 2004, ENAC awarded GESAP an \\"airport certificate\\" in recognition of the airport's full conformity with the regulations set down in ENAC's \\"regulations for the construction and management of airports\\". On 24 May 2007 GESAP has obtained the renewal of the airport certificate until 30 May 2010. Today, after having recently transferred its handling sector to a controlled company, GH Palermo, GESAP is awaiting a ministerial decree that will grant it a forty-year concession for the total management of the airport. This comes after the deliberation of ENAC's board of directors on 1 March 2005 that was officialised in a convention signed on 17 November 2006. Airlines and destinations Accidents and incidents * On 5 May 1972, Alitalia Flight 112 * On 23 December 1978, Alitalia Flight 4128 * On 6 August 2005, Tuninter Flight 1153, an ATR 72‚Äì500 ran out of fuel while en route and ditched about 18 miles from the city of Palermo. 16 of the 39 people on board died. * On 24 September 2010, Wind Jet Flight 243, operated by Airbus A319-132 EI-EDM, landed short of the runway after encountering a thunderstorm and windshear on approach. The aircraft was substantially damaged when it impacted the localiser. Both main undercarriage sets collapsed and the aircraft was evacuated by the emergency slides. Around 20 passengers were injured in the evacuation. Ground transport =Train= The airport's railway facility, Punta Raisi railway station, is the northwestern terminus of Palermo metropolitan railway service. It links the airport with Palermo Centrale railway station. A typical timetable on work days is a train every 30 minutes in each direction between early morning and around 10.00 pm. =Bus= There are several private bus companies, which stop at the bus station outside the terminal building and connect the airport with nearby Palermo city. There are further connections to/from Palermo, Catania, Messina and rest of Sicily.

It is non-migratory and usually stays within its breeding range, though it sometimes irrupts southward. It is one of the few owls that is neither nocturnal nor crepuscular, being active only during the day. This is the only living species in the genus Surnia of the family Strigidae, the \\"typical\\" owls (as opposed to barn owls, Tytonidae). The species is sometimes called simply the hawk owl; however, many species of owls in the genus Ninox are also called \\"hawk owls\\". The genus name Surnia appears to be a word made up by A. M. C. Dum√©ril, the creator of the genus, and ulula is Latin for a screech owl. Description Male northern hawk-owls are generally long and weigh about . Females are slightly bigger with a length of and a mass of about . Both male and female have similar wingspans of about . The northern hawk-owl plumage is relatively dark brown with an off-white spotting pattern on all dorsal parts of the body with the exception of the back of the neck which boasts a black v-shaped pattern. The underbelly is generally white or off-white which continues to the toes with brown bands on the breast and stomach. It also boasts a long tail with brown banding. The northern hawk-owl has a smokey white face with a black border, a flat head, yellow eyes and a yellow curved beak.Duncan, James R. and Patricia A. Duncan. (1998) Northern Hawk-Owl (Surnia ulula), The Birds of North America Online (A. Poole, Ed.). Ithaca: Cornell Lab of Ornithology; Retrieved from the Birds of North America Online: . The northern hawk-owl has been said to resemble a hawk in appearance and in behavior. In North America, its appearance in flight is often considered similar to a Cooper's hawk (Accipiter cooperii). It has been suggested that this may be because the hawk-owl may partially fill an important diurnal niche similar to that of day hunters such as hawks. At Prague Zoo Vocalization S. ulula has a variety of calls used by the different sexes in different situations. When attracting a mate the male usually lets out a rolled whistle of ulululululululul and a sound similar to tu-wita-wit, tiwita-tu-wita, wita, when perching at a potential nest site. The female's call is usually less constant and more shrill. When alerting to danger, the northern hawk-owl lets out a sound similar to rike, rike, rike, rike. It also releases a high pitched scream followed by a yip when an intruder is near to the nest. To warn of impending dangers to a fledgling, the hawk-owl will let out a noise similar to ki ki kikikikiki. Calls can vary in length from 15 s to 2 min. Distribution Three subspecies exist across the northern holarctic.K√∂nig C, Weick F, Wink M. 2008. Owls of the world. London: Christopher Helm. The North American subspecies S. u. caparoch spans from eastern Alaska through Canada to Newfoundland and in some areas extends south into northern United States. The other two subspecies are found in Eurosiberia: S. u. tianschanica breeds in Central Asia reaching Xinjiang (China) and S. u. ulula resides across reaching Siberia at its most eastern range. Occasionally, S. u. caparoch can extend its territory as far south as northern Minnesota and many other states in the northern United States including more central states such as West Virginia, New York, and South Dakota. These southern forays into the northern United States are rare and generally occur during winter, or following an explosion in a population of prey. S. u. caparoch can occasionally be found in more southern areas such as Great Britain, southern Russia and Scandinavia, following explosions of prey. Habitat Northern hawk-owls are unevenly distributed and highly variable throughout the boreal forest. They live mostly in open coniferous forests, or coniferous forests mixed with deciduous species such as larch, birch, poplar, and willow. They are found in muskegs, clearings, swamp valleys, meadows, or recently burnt areas, and generally avoid dense spruce-fir forests. Winter habitat is usually the same as breeding habitat. Breeding Eggs, Collection Museum Wiesbaden The northern hawk-owl generally starts its mating rituals at the beginning of March. After calling and pairing is complete the northern hawk-owl will build a nest and start to lay eggs. On average the northern hawk-owl will lay 3‚Äì11 eggs per brood. The nest sites are usually the tops of hollow stumps of old dead spruce trees. These nesting sites are usually above ground for the North American S. u. caparoch and approximately above ground for the Eurasian S. u. ulala. The specific dates of egg appearance can be quite variable depending on locality. In central Canada eggs are usually laid from March 30 to the 5th of June. On Newfoundland the appearance of eggs occurs later, between May 9 and June 11. In Finland however, eggs can be found anywhere between the 30th of March to the 23rd of June. For the most part the female northern hawk-owl does the incubating of the eggs whilst the male forages for food. Once the chicks have hatched their roles shift drastically. At about two weeks into the chicks' lives the female starts to leave the nest for long spans of time (5 hours or more). This span of time is presumably when the female hunts. The male however, will guard the nest diligently until the chicks leave. When predators (usually other raptors) fly nearby, the male will sometimes chase them away from the nest if he feels it is necessary. Once the owlets have grown to a size which allows less parental supervision, they will leave the nest. This occurs on average after their 21st day, and can begin as early as mid-June. After this the female will provide most of the care. However, the male will remain close and will still feed his young on occasion. The northern hawk-owl has also been known to nest on cliffsides. It has little fear of humans, and will attack if the young are approached too closely. Diet The northern hawk-owl feeds on a variety of prey, which can include small rodents to mammals more robust in size, and a variety of birds, a typical diet for many boreal owls. In Eurasia the northern hawk-owl is known to feed primarily on voles from the Microtus family. These voles usually follow a 3‚Äì4 year cycle of abundance. Therefore, S. u. ulula numbers are affected negatively when the numbers of voles are lowest. In North America the subspecies S. u. caparoch also feeds upon microtine voles, but its population is primarily based on the ten year cycling of the snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus). In Eurasia the northern hawk-owl's biomass consists of about 94% microtine voles, whereas in North America the percentage of biomass contributed by voles can be as low as 20%. Juvenile hares are considerably more important at 40‚Äì50%. Other animals that are important prey items for the northern hawk-owl include the red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) which has been documented to contribute as much as 20% to the hawk-owl's biomass. A long list of others include mice, rats, voles, lemmings, the short-tail weasel (Mustela erminea), partridge, spruce grouse (Falcipennis canadensis), doves, pileated woodpeckers (Dryocopus pileatus), sparrows, jays, robins, starlings, buntings, grackles, and finches. In the winter, feeding strategies change; where in summer the main source of food is mammals, in the winter a bigger portion of the hawk-owl's biomass consists of ground dwelling birds, such as the ptarmigan and the grouse. The northern hawk-owl is a partially diurnal hunter, although it has been recorded hunting at varying times and does not appear to have a preferred hunting time. Whether the bird resides in Eurasia or North America, the strategy is usually similar. The northern hawk-owl will perch and scour the immediate area for prey. As these owls are considered a search- oriented species they likely do not stay put for long if the site is not producing prey. The hawk-owl prefers open, forest-type environments when perching. These environments include sphagnum bogs and partially deforested areas. The preferred perching tree of the northern hawk-owl is the spruce tree. When the hawk-owl attacks, it goes from a horizontal posture into a gliding dive. If the prey is further away, the bird will flap its wings a few times during the dive to increase distance. The hawk-owl has exceptional hearing and can plunge into snow to capture rodents below the surface. The type of prey the hawk-owl catches will determine its eating strategy. For mammalian prey the ritual is generally the same: the northern hawk-owl will eviscerate its prey, eats the head first (especially for prey like the red squirrel, whose head is fairly large), and then‚Äîwhen tackling larger prey‚Äîit will eat the organs and cache the remains; with smaller prey, the owl will simply swallow the body whole. Phylogeny Northern hawk-owls are the only representative of the genus Surnia,Voous KH, Cameron A. (1989) Owls of the northern hemisphere. Cambridge (MA): MIT Press . and no known fossil relatives exist. When the nearest relatives of the northern hawk-owl were unknown, Voous and Cameron (1989) initially noted similarities with the Glaucidium owls based on ear morphology and facial characteristics. In 1991, Schmutz and Moker first reported the karyotype of the northern hawk-owl and found it to resemble considerably that of the genus Athene. Maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees created from nucleotide sequencing of the cytochrome b gene demonstrated that Surnia and Glaucidium form a paraphyletic group.Nieuwenhuyse Dv, G√©not J-C, Johnson DH. (2008) The little owl : Conservation, ecology, and behavior of Athene noctua. Cambridge, UK; New York: Cambridge University Press . Conservation and status Due to its low density occurrence, sporadic fluctuations, and remote breeding locations, the northern hawk-owl is one of the least studied and poorly understood birds in North America. As a result, it is almost impossible to properly estimate its numbers.Johnsgard PA. (2002) North American Owls: Biology and natural history. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press . In Yukon, northern hawk-owl densities were estimated to be between zero and six pairs per . Despite these low densities, the North American population is thought to be fairly large given that they occur throughout the boreal forest. Duncan and Harris (1997) estimated that this population contains between 10 000 and 50 000 pairs. Populations are known to fluctuate with cycles of small rodents and irruptions are known to occur in sub-boreal regions throughout the world. In Scandinavia, populations have been reported to vary from a few hundred birds in certain years to over 4000 birds in others and even up to 10 000 breeding pairs in optimal years. Irruptions can be used as indicators of small mammal abundance and in eastern North America, southern irruptions have been linked with low densities of red-backed voles in the high boreal forest. In North America, over 50% of the northern hawk-owls' breeding territory occurs in non- commercial boreal forests and as long as nothing threatens their northern habitats, no known factors challenge their existence. However, it is unknown what effects modern forestry would have on population levels because although it would decrease nesting localities, it would simultaneously create ideal habitat for Microtus prey. Fire suppression by humans is believed to negatively affect northern hawk-owl populations by reducing open areas for hunting and dead wood to nest in. The status and conservation of this species is uncertain. A report by the Committee On the Status of Endangered Wildlife In Canada (COSEWIC) recommended that no designation be assigned for the northern hawk-owl.Duncan PA, Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (1992). Status report on the northern hawk-owl, Surnia ulula. Ottawa: Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. Compared to the nineteenth century, southern irruptions in the New and Old World appear to have declined. Also, North American populations seem to be declining, although no proper documentation exists to confirm this trend. In Canada, it was ranked 85th overall to set conservation, research, or monitoring priorities.Dunn EH. (1997) Setting priorities for conservation, research and monitoring of Canada's landbirds. Tech. Rep. Ser. No. 293. Can. Wildl. Serv. Ottawa, ON. Cited in: Duncan JR, Duncan PA, Poole A, editor. 1998. Northern Hawk-Owl Surnia ulula, The Birds of North America Online [Internet]. Ithaca: Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Downes et al. (2000) considered the hawk-owl to be of medium concern, but with a high priority to improve monitoring.Downes CM, Dunn EH, Francis CM. (2000) Canadian landbird monitoring strategy: Monitoring needs and priorities into the new millennium. Partners In Flight-Canada, Ottawa.

It has also been used to describe the emergence of Eastern European parties after the collapse of the Soviet Union.Hanley, Sean (2007). The New Right in the New Europe: Czech Transformation and Right-wing Politics, 1989‚Äì2006.  History  The word \\"New Right\\" appeared during the 1964 presidential campaign of Barry Goldwater to designate \\"the emergence, in response to liberalism (in the American sense of the term [i.e. social liberalism]), of an uninhibited right: ultraconservative, imbued with religious values, openly populist, anti-egalitarian, and intolerant of racial desegregation.\\" Popularized by Richard Viguerie, the term became later used to describe a broader movement in the English-speaking world: socially conservative proponents of the night-watchman state, such as Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, or New Zealand First. However, as Jean-Yves Camus and Nicolas Lebourg point out, this leaning had only a few in common with the \\"European New Right\\" that had been emerging since the 1960s, more inspired by the conservative revolutionary Moeller van den Bruck than by the classical liberal Adam Smith. New Right by country =Australia= In Australia, \\"the New Right\\" refers to a late 1970s/1980s onward movement both within and outside of the Liberal/National Coalition which advocates economically liberal and increased socially conservative policies (as opposed to the \\"old right\\" which advocated economically conservative policies and \\"small-l liberals\\" with more socially liberal views).Verity Archer, \\"Dole bludgers, tax payers and the New Right: Constructing discourses of welfare in 1970s Australia.\\" Labour History 96 (2009): 177‚Äì190. Unlike the United Kingdom and United States, but like neighbouring New Zealand, the 1980s saw the Australian Labor Party initiate Third Way economic reforms, which bear some familiarity to \\"New Right\\" ideology. After the John Howard Coalition ended the 13-year rule of the Hawke-Keating Labor government at the 1996 federal election, economic reforms were taken further, some examples being wholesale labor market deregulation (e.g. WorkChoices), the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), the privatisation of the telecommunications monopoly Telstra, and sweeping welfare reform including \\"work for the dole\\". The H. R. Nicholls Society, a think tank which advocates full workplace deregulation, contains some Liberal MPs as members and is seen to be of the New Right.Marian Sawer, Australia and the new right (Sydney: G. Allen & Unwin, 1982). Economic liberalism is also called economic rationalism in Australia. The term \\"economic rationalism\\" was first used by Labor's Gough Whitlam. to describe a market-oriented form of social democracy, but its meaning subsequently evolved. It is a philosophy which tends to advocate a free market economy, increased deregulation, privatisation, lower direct taxation and higher indirect taxation, and a reduction of the size of the welfare state. The politicians favouring New Right ideology were referred to as \\"dries\\", while those advocating continuation of the economic policies of the post-war consensus, typically Keynesian economics, or were more socially liberal, were called \\"wets\\" (the term \\"wets\\" was similarly used in Britain to refer to those Conservatives who opposed Thatcherite economic policies, but \\"dries\\" in this context was much rarer in British usage).Hugh Collins, \\"Political ideology in Australia: the distinctiveness of a Benthamite society.\\" Daedalus (1985): 147‚Äì169. online =Brazil= The new right in Brazil has grown sharply in recent years within population, intelligentsia and academia. That is mainly due to a generalized discontent with the left-wing government and its policies. This new movement distinguishes itself from what is known in Brazil as \\"old right\\", which was ideologically associated to the Brazilian military government, Uni√£o Democr√°tica Nacional (National Democratic Union) and Integralism. It is identified by positive views regarding democracy, personal freedom, free- market capitalism, reduction of bureaucracy, privatization of state-run companies, tax cuts, parliamentary, political reform. It rejects \\"cultural Marxism\\", Socialism of the 21st century and Populism. There have been two major phenomena relating to the rise of the new Brazilian right: the Free Brazil Movement, which has managed to bring together millions of people on demonstrations against the government in March 2015; and the creation of the New Party (Partido Novo) and Libert√°rios, the first liberal party since the First Brazilian Republic. Some Brazilian new-right thinkers are: Kim Kataguiri, and his movement Movimento Brasil Livre (Free Brazil Moviment), Roberto Campos, Wilson Martins, Olavo de Carvalho, Luiz Felipe Pond√©, Paulo Francis, Jos√© Guilherme Merquior, Bruno Tolentino and Miguel Reale. As a result of this movement, in the 2018's Brazilian election, Jair Messias Bolsonaro was elected President of Brazil with 55% of the votes, his right hand in economic subjects, Paulo Guedes, graduated from the University of Chicago, will be his Economy Minister. =Chile= The term New Right (Spanish: Nueva derecha) has come into mainstream political discourse since the election of Sebasti√°n Pi√±era in 2010, when interior minister Rodrigo Hinzpeter used it to describe his government. Hinzpeter's introduction of the term caused a buzz among newspapers, politicians and analysts. According to a column published in The Clinic, the New Right is different from the old dictatorial right of Augusto Pinochet, in the sense that it embraces democracy. It is also different from the religiously conservative Uni√≥n Dem√≥crata Independiente party, in that it is more open to discussing issues like divorce. According to the same analysis, the New Right is becoming increasingly pragmatic, as shown by their decision to increase taxes following the 2010 Chilean earthquake.Marcelo Pollack, New Right in Chile (Springer, 1999). =France= In France, the New Right (or Nouvelle Droite) has been used as a term to describe a modern think-tank of French political philosophers and intellectuals led by Alain de Benoist. Another noted intellectual, who was once part of Alain de Benoist's GRECE, is Guillaume Faye. Although accused by some critics as being \\"far-right\\" in their beliefs, they themselves claim that their ideas transcend the traditional left‚Äìright divide and actively encourages free debate. France also has one Identitarian New Right group (which is connected with Thule Seminar in Germany); that is Terre et Peuple of Pierre Vial, who was once an integral part and founding member of Alain de Benoist's GRECE.Simon Bornschier, \\"Why a right-wing populist party emerged in France but not in Germany: cleavages and actors in the formation of a new cultural divide.\\" European Political Science Review 4.1 (2012): 121‚Äì145. online =Germany= In Germany, the Neue Rechte (literally, new right) consists of two parts: the Jungkonservative (literally, young conservatives), who search for followers in the civic part of the population; and, secondly, the \\"Nationalrevolution√§re\\" (national revolutionists), who are looking for followers in the ultra-right part of the German population, and use the rhetoric of right-wing politicians such as Gregor and Otto Strasser. Another noted New Right group in Germany is Thule Seminar of Pierre Krebs.Michael Minkenberg, \\"The new right in Germany: The transformation of conservatism and the extreme right.\\" European Journal of Political Research 22.1 (1992): 55‚Äì81. =Greece= Failos Kranidiotis, a Greek politician who had been expelled by New Democracy chairman Kyriakos Mitsotakis for expressing views more similar to political rival Golden Dawn than those of former Prime Minister of Greece Konstantinos Mitsotakis whose legacy expressed the most important principle of its recently elected leadership, including Adonis Georgiadis who had been a member only since leaving far-right Popular Orthodox Rally in 2012, instead of those expressed by the previous heads of the party who had close friendships with him, specifically Kostas Karamanlis, Antonis Samaras and Vangelis Meimarakis, founded the New Right party based on national liberalism in May 2016.Vasiliki Georgiadou, and Lamprini Rori. \\"Economic crisis, social and political impact. The new right-wing extremism in Greece.\\" Anuari del Conflicte Social (2013). online =Iran= In Iran, New Right and the term \\"Modern Right\\" () is associated with the Executives of Construction Party, which has split from the 'traditional Right'. =Israel= New Right is a right-wing political party in Israel, founded in 2018 and led by Ayelet Shaked and Naftali Bennett. The party aims to be a party open to both secular and religious people. The party advocates the preservation of a strong right- wing in Israel. =Netherlands= The New Right (NR) was the name of a far- right/nationalist political party in the Netherlands from 2003 to 2007. The Party for Freedom (PVV), founded in 2005 and led by Geert Wilders, also is a New Right movement. Since March 2017 Forum voor Democratie is another new right party in the Dutch parliament. =New Zealand= In New Zealand, as in Australia, it was the Labour Party that initially adopted \\"New Right\\" economic policies. \\"Rogernomics\\" involved monetarist approaches to controlling inflation, corporatisation of government departments, and the removal of tariffs and subsidies, while the party also pursued social liberal stances such as decriminalisation of male homosexuality, pay equity for women and adopting a nuclear-free policy. This meant temporary realignment within New Zealand politics, as \\"New Right\\" middle-class voters voted Labour at the 1987 New Zealand general election in approval of its economic policies. At first, Labour corporatised many former government departments and state assets, then emulated the Conservative Thatcher administration and privatised them altogether during Labour's second term of office. However, recession and privatisation together led to increasing strains within the Labour Party, which led to schism, and the exit of Jim Anderton and his NewLabour Party, which later formed part of the Alliance Party with the Greens and other opponents of New Right economics.Michael Peters, and James Marshall. \\"Education, the new right and the crisis of the welfare state in New Zealand.\\" Australian Journal of Education Studies 11.1 (1990): 77‚Äì90. However, dissent and schism were not to be limited to the Labour Party and Alliance Party alone. During the Labour Party's second term in office, the Opposition New Zealand National Party (popularly known as 'National') selected Ruth Richardson as Opposition finance spokesperson, and when National won the 1990 general election, Richardson became Minister of Finance, while Jenny Shipley became Minister of Social Welfare. Richardson introduced deunionisation legislation, known as the Employment Contracts Act, in 1991, while Shipley presided over social welfare benefit cuts, designed to reduce \\"welfare dependency\\" ‚Äì both core New Right policy initiatives. In the early nineties, maverick National Party MP Winston Peters also came to oppose New Right economic policies, and led his elderly voting bloc out of the National Party. As a result, his New Zealand First anti-monetarist party has been a partner in coalition governments led by both National (1996‚Äì98) and Labour (2005‚Äì08 and 2017-ongoing). Due to the introduction of the MMP electoral system, a New Right \\"Association of Consumers and Taxpayers\\" party, known as ACT New Zealand, was formed by ex-Labour New Right-aligned Cabinet Ministers like Richard Prebble and others, and maintaining existing New Right policy initiatives such as the Employment Contracts Act, while also introducing US- style \\"welfare reform.\\" ACT New Zealand aspired to become National's centre- right coalition partner, but has been hampered by lack of party unity and populist leadership that often lacked strategic direction. As for Labour and National themselves, their fortunes have been mixed. Labour was out of office for most of the nineties, only regaining power when Helen Clark led it to victory and a Labour/Alliance coalition and centre-left government (1999‚Äì2002). However, the Alliance disintegrated in 2002. National was defeated in 1999 due to the absence of a suitable stable coalition partner, given New Zealand First's partial disintegration after Winston Peters abandoned the prior National-led coalition. When Bill English became leader of National in 2001, it was thought that he might lead the party away from its prior hardline New Right economic and social policies, but his indecisiveness and lack of firm policy direction led to ACT New Zealand gaining the New Right middle-class voting basis in 2002. When Don Brash became leader, New Right middle-class voters returned to National's fold, causing National's revival in fortunes at the 2005 New Zealand general election. However, at the same time, ACT New Zealand strongly criticised it for deviating from its former New Right economic policy perspectives, and at the same election, National did little to enable ACT's survival. Don Brash resigned as National party leader, being replaced by John Key, who was a more moderate National MP. As for the centre- left, Helen Clark and her Labour-led coalition were criticised by ex-Alliance members and non-government organisations for their alleged lack of attention to centre-left social policies, while trade union membership recovered due to Labour's repeal of the Employment Contracts Act 1991 and labour market deregulation and the deunionisation that had accompanied it in the nineties. It is plausible that Clark and her Cabinet were influenced by Tony Blair and his British Labour Government, which pursued a similar balancing act between social and fiscal responsibility while in government.Roger Dale, \\"National reform, economic crisis and ‚ÄòNew Right‚Äôtheory: A New Zealand perspective.\\" Discourse 14.2 (1994): 17‚Äì29. =Poland= In Poland, a conservative libertarian and eurosceptic political party Congress of the New Right (New Right) was founded on 25 March 2011 from former political parties Freedom and Lawfulness (WiP) and Real Politics Union (UPR) by Janusz Korwin-Mikke. It is backed up by various voters, some conservatives, people who want to legalize marijuana and citizens who endorse free market and capitalism. = South Korea = In South Korea, the South Korean New Right movement is a Korean attempt at neoconservative politics. The Lee Myung-bak government led by President Lee Myung-bak and the conservative Grand National Party is noted for being a benefactor of the domestic New Right movement. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, the term New Right more specifically refers to a strand of Conservatism that the likes of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan influenced. Thatcher's style of New Right ideology, known as Thatcherism, was heavily influenced by the work of Friedrich Hayek (in particular the book The Road to Serfdom). They were ideologically committed to economic liberalism as well as being socially conservative. Key policies included: deregulation of business, a dismantling of the welfare state, privatisation of state-owned industries and restructuring of the national workforce in order to increase industrial and economic flexibility in an increasingly global market. =United States= In the United States, New Right refers to two historically distinct conservative political movements.Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson (2006) American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia. ISI Books: Wilmington, DE. These American New Rights are distinct from and opposed to the more moderate tradition of the so-called Rockefeller Republicans. The New Right also differs from the Old Right (1933‚Äì55) on issues concerning foreign policy with neoconservatives being opposed to the non-interventionism of the Old Right.  First New Right  The first New Right (1955‚Äì64) was centered on the right-wing libertarians, traditionalists, and anti-communists at William F. Buckley's National Review. Sociologists and journalists had used new right since the 1950s; it was first used as self-identification in 1962 by the student activist group Young Americans for Freedom.Viguerie, Richard. The New Right: We're Ready to Lead. 1981, Caroline House, p. 53 The first New Right embraced what it called \\"fusionism\\" (an ostensible synthesis of classical liberal economics, traditional social values, and anti-communism) and coalesced in the years preceding the 1964 presidential campaign of Barry Goldwater. The Goldwater campaign, which failed to unseat incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson, hastened the formation of a new political movement. First New Right figures: * William F. Buckley, Jr. ‚Äì editor of National Review * Frank Meyer ‚Äì anti-communist libertarian and creator of the \\"fusionist\\" political theory * James Burnham ‚Äì anti-communist political theorist * M. Stanton Evans ‚Äì journalist and writer of Young Americans for Freedom's Sharon Statement * Barry Goldwater ‚Äì U.S. Senator from Arizona and Republican U.S. presidential candidate  Second New Right  The second New Right (1964 to present) was formed in the wake of the Goldwater campaign and had a more populist tone than the first New Right. The second New Right tended to focus on wedge issues (such as abortion) and was often linked with the Religious Right.Gottfried, Paul and Thomas Fleming (1988) The Conservative Movement. Twayne Publishers: Boston, pp. 77‚Äì95. The second New Right formed a policy approach and electoral apparatus that brought Ronald Reagan into the White House in the 1980 presidential election. The New Right was organized in the American Enterprise Institute and The Heritage Foundation to counter the so- called \\"liberal establishment\\". In elite think tanks and local community organizations alike, new policies, marketing strategies, and electoral strategies were crafted over the succeeding decades to promote strongly conservative policies.Arin, Kubilay Yado: Think Tanks, the Brain Trusts of US Foreign Policy.

The series includes the HP 48S, HP 48SX, HP 48G, HP 48GX, and HP 48G+, the G models being expanded and improved versions of the S models. The models with an X suffix are expandable via special RAM (memory expansion) and ROM (software application) cards. In particular, the GX models have more onboard memory than the G models. The G+ models have more onboard memory only. The SX and S models have the same amount of onboard memory. Note that the similarly named hp 48gII (2004) is not really a member of the series, but rather much more closely related to the hp 49g+. The hardware architecture developed for the HP 48 series became the basis for the HP 38G, with a simplified user interface and an infix input method, and the HP 49G with various software enhancements. Likewise, the hardware and software design of the HP 48 calculators are themselves strongly influenced by other calculators in the HP line, most of all by the HP-18C and the HP-28 series.

The main registers A, B, C, D, along with temp registers R0, R1, R2, R3, and R4 are a full 64-bits wide, but the data registers D0 & D1 are only 20-bit. External logical data fetches are transparently converted to 8-bit physical fetches. The processor has a 20-bit address bus available to code but due to the presence of the high/low nibble selection bit, only 19 bits are available externally. In both the HP 48S/SX and G/GX series, the Saturn CPU core is integrated as part of a more complex integrated circuit (IC) package. These packages have codenames inspired by the members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The codename of the IC is Clarke in the S/SX, after William Clark, and Yorke in the G/GX, after Clark's manservant. The previous series of Saturn-based ICs were codenamed Lewis, after Meriwether Lewis. =Common for all models= * CPU architecture: Saturn * Screen resolution: 131√ó64 pixels * Communication ports: 4-pin RS-232 (Serial port, standard UART at 1200 to 9600 bauds with option for parity (none/even/odd/mark/space)) and Infrared port (not IrDA, similar to serial, zeroes are pulses with duration 1/8 of a full bit time) * Data bus width: 8-bit (external) * Maximum 4-bit-cell address width: 20 bits (leading to the address space shown next) * Logical address space: 512 KB * Maximum register size: 64 bit (both working and scratch registers) * Available expansion card ports on X models: 2 * Expansion card pins: 40 =HP 48S/HP 48SX specific= * CPU clock frequency: 2 MHz * Memory clock frequency: 2 MHz * CPU codename: Clarke (Saturn 1LT8 core) * Communication protocol(s): Kermit (protocol) * On- board ROM: 256 KB * On-board RAM: 32 KB * Maximum additional memory per expansion card: 128 KB (48SX only) * ROM versions: A, B, C, D, E, (F,) J =HP 48G/HP 48GX/HP 48G+ specific= Hewlett-Packard 48GX Scientific Graphing Calculator * CPU clock frequency: 3.68 to 4 MHz ** Some claim that the frequency varies according to temperature ** According to one of the engineers on the design team of the HP 48G series (Dave Arnett), the yields for 4 MHz CPUs were essentially separated into two bins: the ones closest to spec, generally near 3.93-3.94 MHz, were reserved for the expandable models (GX), and those just slightly under spec were used for the non-expandable units (G). Eventually the yields improved and the CPUs which clocked closer to 4 MHz were installed in the non-expandable units as well. The effects of (non-extreme) temperatures are almost negligible. * Memory clock frequency: 2 MHz * CPU codename: Yorke (Saturn HP 00048-80063 core) * Communication protocol(s): Kermit (protocol), Xmodem * On-board ROM: 512 KB * On-board RAM: 32 KB (48G) or 128 KB (48G+/48GX) * Maximum additional memory for expansion card port 1: 128 KB * Maximum additional memory for expansion card port 2: 4 MB (128 KB addressable at any given time via bank switching) * ROM versions: K, L, M, P, R Programming The HP 48 series of calculators support a stack-based programming language named RPL, a supposed combination of Reverse Polish notation (RPN) and Lisp. RPL adds the concepts of lists and functions to stack-based programming, allowing the programmer to pass unevaluated code as arguments to functions, or return unevaluated code from a function by leaving it on the stack. RPL comes in two flavors: User RPL and System RPL. User RPL is the language that a user can program directly on the calculator. System RPL requires an external compiler; this may be done on the calculator with a third-party utility, or on another machine. The two languages vary mainly in the number of low-level operations available to them. User RPL does not expose any commands that do not check their arguments. Consequently, User RPL programs cannot normally crash the calculator (and are therefore slower than System RPL programs), whereas a System RPL program that invokes a command with incorrect arguments will almost certainly leave the calculator in a state which requires a full memory reset. It is also possible to program the HP 48 directly in machine language.

He is one of the most critically acclaimed and decorated authors in the English language. He has won the Booker Prize (twice), the CNA Prize (thrice), the Jerusalem Prize, the Prix Femina √©tranger, and The Irish Times International Fiction Prize, and holds a number of other awards and honorary doctorates. Coetzee moved to Australia in 2002 and became an Australian citizen in 2006. He lives in Adelaide. Life and career =Early life (Boyhood)= Coetzee was born in Cape Town, Cape Province, Union of South Africa, on 9 February 1940 to Afrikaner parents. His father, Zacharias Coetzee (1912‚Äì1988), was an occasional attorney and government employee, and his mother, Vera Coetzee (n√©e Wehmeyer; 1904‚Äì1986), a schoolteacher. The family mainly spoke English at home, but John spoke Afrikaans with other relatives. He is descended from 17th-century Dutch immigrants to South Africa \\"His Cape ancestry begins as early as the 17th century with the arrival from Holland of one Dirk Couch√©...\\" on his father's side, and from Dutch, German and Polish immigrants through his mother. \\"His maternal great-grandfather was born in Czarnylas, Poland\\" Coetzee spent most of his early life in Cape Town and in Worcester, a town in the Cape Province (modern-day Western Cape), as recounted in his fictionalised memoir, Boyhood (1997). His family moved to Worcester when he was eight, after his father lost his government job. He attended St. Joseph's College, a Catholic school in the Cape Town suburb Rondebosch, later studying mathematics and English at the University of Cape Town and receiving his Bachelor of Arts with honours in English in 1960 and his Bachelor of Arts with honours in mathematics in 1961. =London (Youth)= Coetzee moved to the United Kingdom in 1962 and worked as a computer programmer for IBM in London and ICT (International Computers and Tabulators) in Bracknell, staying until 1965. In 1963, the University of Cape Town awarded him a Master of Arts degree for his thesis \\"The Works of Ford Madox Ford with Particular Reference to the Novels\\" (1963). Coetzee's experiences in England were later recounted in Youth (2002), his second volume of fictionalised memoirs. =Academia= United States In 1965 Coetzee went to the University of Texas at Austin, in the United States, on the Fulbright Program, receiving his doctorate in 1969. His PhD dissertation was a computer-aided stylistic analysis of Samuel Beckett's English prose. In 1968, Coetzee began teaching English literature at the State University of New York at Buffalo, where he stayed until 1971. At Buffalo he began his first novel, Dusklands. From as early as 1968 Coetzee sought permanent residence in the U.S., a process that was finally unsuccessful, in part due to his involvement in protests against the war in Vietnam. In March 1970, he was one of 45 faculty members who occupied the university's Hayes Hall and were arrested for criminal trespass. The charges against them were dropped in 1971. University of Cape Town In 1972 Coetzee returned to South Africa and was appointed lecturer in the Department of English Language and Literature at the University of Cape Town. He was promoted to senior lecturer and associate professor before becoming Professor of General Literature in 1984. In 1994 Coetzee became Arderne Professor in English, and in 1999 he was appointed Distinguished Professor in the Faculty of Humanities. Upon retirement in 2002, he was awarded emeritus status. He served on the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago until 2003. Adelaide After relocating to Adelaide, Australia, Coetzee was made an honorary research fellow at the English Department of the University of Adelaide, where his partner, Dorothy Driver, is a fellow academic. , Coetzee is listed as Professor of Literature within English and Creative Writing at the school, and Driver as Visiting Research Fellow. Works Coetzee's first novel was Dusklands (1974) and he has continued to publish a novel about every three years. He has also written autobiographical novels, such as Boyhood, Youth and Summertime, short fiction, translations from Dutch and Afrikaans, and numerous essays and works of criticism. Awards, recognition, appearances Coetzee has received numerous awards throughout his career, although he has a reputation for avoiding award ceremonies. =1983 and 1999 Booker Prizes= Coetzee was the first writer to be awarded the Booker Prize twice: for Life & Times of Michael K in 1983, and for Disgrace in 1999. , four other authors have achieved this, J.G. Farrell, Peter Carey, Hilary Mantel, and Margaret Atwood. Summertime, named on the 2009 longlist, was an early favourite to win Coetzee an unprecedented third Booker Prize. It made the shortlist, but lost to bookmakers' favourite Wolf Hall, by Mantel. Coetzee was also longlisted in 2003 for Elizabeth Costello and in 2005 for Slow Man. The Schooldays of Jesus, a follow up to his 2013 novel The Childhood of Jesus, was longlisted for the 2016 Booker Prize. =2003 Nobel Prize in Literature= On 2 October 2003, Horace Engdahl, head of the Swedish Academy, announced that Coetzee had been chosen as that year's recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature, making him the fourth African writer to be so honoured and the second South African, after Nadine Gordimer. When awarding the prize, the Swedish Academy stated that Coetzee \\"in innumerable guises portrays the surprising involvement of the outsider\\". The press release for the award also cited his \\"well-crafted composition, pregnant dialogue and analytical brilliance\\", while focusing on the moral nature of his work. The prize ceremony was held in Stockholm on 10 December 2003. =Other awards and recognition= Coetzee is a three-time winner of South Africa's CNA Prize. His Waiting for the Barbarians received both the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize, Age of Iron was awarded the Sunday Express Book of the Year award, and The Master of Petersburg was awarded The Irish Times International Fiction Prize in 1995. He has also won the French Prix Femina √©tranger and two Commonwealth Writers' Prizes for the African region, for Master of St Petersburg in 1995 and for Disgrace in 2000 (the latter personally presented by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace), and the 1987 Jerusalem Prize for the Freedom of the Individual in Society. In 1998 Coetzee received the Lannan Literary Award for Fiction. On 27 September 2005 The South African government awarded Coetzee the Order of Mapungubwe (gold class) for his \\"exceptional contribution in the field of literature and for putting South Africa on the world stage.\\" He holds honorary doctorates from The American University of Paris, the University of Adelaide, La Trobe University, the University of Natal, the University of Oxford, Rhodes University, the State University of New York at Buffalo, the University of Strathclyde, the University of Technology, Sydney, the Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna≈Ñ and the Universidad Iberoamericana. In 2013, Richard Poplak of the Daily Maverick described Coetzee as \\"inarguably the most celebrated and decorated living English-language author\\". Adelaide In 2004, the Lord Mayor of Adelaide handed Coetzee the keys to the city. In 2010, Coetzee was made an international ambassador for Adelaide Writers' Week, along with American novelist Susanna Moore and English poet Michael Hulse. Coetzee is patron of the J.M. Coetzee Centre for Creative Practice (JMCCCP), a research centre and cultural hub. The centre runs workshops with the aim of providing \\"a stimulating environment for emerging and established writers, scholars and musicians\\". Coetzee's work provides particular inspiration to encourage engagement with social and political issues, as well as music. The centre was established in 2015. In November 2014, Coetzee was honoured with a three-day academic conference, \\"JM Coetzee in the World\\", in Adelaide. It was called \\"the culmination of an enormous collaborative effort and the first event of its kind in Australia\\" and \\"a reflection of the deep esteem in which John Coetzee is held by Australian academia\\". Writers' Week Coetzee first visited Adelaide in 1996 when he was invited to appear at Adelaide Writers' Week. He subsequently made appearances at the literary festival in 2004, 2010 (when he introduced Geoff Dyer) and 2019 (when he introduced Marlene van Niekerk). Philosophy =South Africa= According to Fred Pfeil, Coetzee, Andr√© Brink and Breyten Breytenbach were at \\"the forefront of the anti-apartheid movement within Afrikaner literature and letters\\". On accepting the Jerusalem Prize in 1987, Coetzee spoke of the limitations of art in South African society, whose structures had resulted in \\"deformed and stunted relations between human beings\\" and \\"a deformed and stunted inner life\\". He added, \\"South African literature is a literature in bondage. It is a less than fully human literature. It is exactly the kind of literature you would expect people to write from prison\\", and called on the South African government to abandon its apartheid policy. The scholar Isidore Diala wrote that Coetzee, Nadine Gordimer, and Brink are \\"three of South Africa's most distinguished white writers, all with definite anti-apartheid commitment\\". It has been argued that Coetzee's 1999 novel Disgrace allegorises South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Asked about his views on the TRC, Coetzee said, \\"In a state with no official religion, the TRC was somewhat anomalous: a court of a certain kind based to a large degree on Christian teaching and on a strand of Christian teaching accepted in their hearts by only a tiny proportion of the citizenry. Only the future will tell what the TRC managed to achieve\\". After his Australian citizenship ceremony, Coetzee said, \\"I did not so much leave South Africa, a country with which I retain strong emotional ties, but come to Australia. I came because from the time of my first visit in 1991, I was attracted by the free and generous spirit of the people, by the beauty of the land itself and‚Äîwhen I first saw Adelaide‚Äîby the grace of the city that I now have the honour of calling my home.\\" When he moved to Australia, Coetzee cited the South African government's lax attitude to crime in that country as a reason, leading to a spat with Thabo Mbeki, who said, \\"South Africa is not only a place of rape\\", referencing Coetzee's Disgrace. In 1999, the African National Congress's submission to a South African Human Rights Commission investigation into racism in the media said that Disgrace depicted racist stereotypes. But when Coetzee won the Nobel Prize, Mbeki congratulated him \\"on behalf of the South African nation and indeed the continent of Africa\\". =Politics= Coetzee has never specified any political orientation, though has alluded to politics in his work. Writing about his past in the third person, Coetzee wrote in Doubling the Point: Asked about the latter part of this quote in an interview, Coetzee answered, \\"There is no longer a left worth speaking of, and a language of the left. The language of politics, with its new economistic bent, is even more repellent than it was 15 years ago\\". In February 2016, Coetzee was one of 61 signatories to a letter to Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and immigration minister Peter Dutton condemning their government's policy of offshore detention of asylum seekers. =Law= In 2005, Coetzee criticised contemporary anti-terrorism laws as resembling those of South Africa's apartheid regime: \\"I used to think that the people who created [South Africa's] laws that effectively suspended the rule of law were moral barbarians. Now I know they were just pioneers ahead of their time\\". The main character in Coetzee's 2007 Diary of a Bad Year, which has been described as blending \\"memoir with fiction, academic criticism with novelistic narration\\" and refusing \\"to recognize the border that has traditionally separated political theory from fictional narrative\\", shares similar concerns about the policies of John Howard and George W. Bush. =Animals= In recent years, Coetzee has become a vocal critic of cruelty to animals and an advocate of animal rights. In a speech given on his behalf by Hugo Weaving in Sydney on 22 February 2007, Coetzee railed against the modern animal husbandry industry. The speech was for Voiceless, the animal protection institute, an Australian nonprofit animal protection organization of which Coetzee became a patron in 2004. Coetzee's fiction has similarly engaged with animal cruelty and animal welfare, especially The Lives of Animals, Disgrace, Elizabeth Costello, and The Old Woman and the Cats. He is a vegetarian. In 2008, at the behest of John Banville, who alerted him to the matter, Coetzee wrote to The Irish Times of his opposition to Trinity College Dublin's use of vivisection on animals for scientific research. He wrote: \\"I support the sentiments expressed by John Banville. There is no good reason‚Äîin fact there has never been any good reason, scientific or pedagogical‚Äîto require students to cut up living animals. Trinity College brings shame on itself by continuing with the practice.\\" Nearly nine years later, when TCD's continued (and, indeed, increasing) practice of vivisection featured in the news, a listener to the RT√â Radio 1 weekday afternoon show Liveline pointed out that Banville had previously raised the matter but been ignored. Banville then telephoned Liveline to call the practice \\"absolutely disgraceful\\" and recalled how his and Coetzee's efforts to intervene had been to no avail: \\"I was passing by the front gates of Trinity one day and there was a group of mostly young women protesting and I was interested. I went over and I spoke to them and they said that vivisection experiments were being carried out in the college. This was a great surprise to me and a great shock, so I wrote a letter of protest to The Irish Times. Some lady professor from Trinity wrote back essentially saying Mr. Banville should stick to his books and leave us scientists to our valuable work.\\" Asked if he received any other support for his stance in the letter he sent to The Irish Times, Banville replied, \\"No. I became entirely dispirited and I thought, 'Just shut up, John. Stay out of it because I'm not going to do any good'. If I had done any good I would have kept it on. I mean, I got John Coetzee‚Äîyou know, the famous novelist J. M. Coetzee‚ÄîI got him to write a letter to The Irish Times. I asked a lot of people.\\" Note that the source's transcript is not exactly verbatim when compared to the actual radio recording. Coetzee wanted to be a candidate in the 2014 European Parliament election for the Dutch Party for the Animals, but the Dutch election board rejected his candidacy, arguing that candidates had to prove legal residence in the European Union. =The South= From 2015 to 2018, Coetzee was a director of a seminar on the Literatures of the South at the Universidad Nacional de San Mart√≠n. This involved writers and literary figures from Southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and South America.See the C√°tedra Coetzee: Literaturas del Sur website The aim of the seminars, one observer remarked, was \\"to develop comparative perspectives on the literature\\" and journalism of the three areas, \\"to establish new intellectual networks, and to build a corpus of translated works from across the South through collaborative publishing ventures.\\"Halford, James (28 February 2017), \\"Southern Conversations: J.M. Coetzee in Buenos Aires\\", Sydney Review of Books7. At the same time he was involved in a research project in Australia, Other Worlds: Forms of World Literature, for which he led a theme on \\"Everyday Pleasures\\" that is also focused on the literatures of the South.See the Other Worlds website =Copyright/piracy= When asked in 2015 to address unofficial Iranian translations of foreign works‚ÄîIran does not recognize international copyright agreements‚ÄîCoetzee stated his disapproval of the practice on moral grounds and wished to have it sent to journalistic organisations in that country. Personal life =Public image= Coetzee is known to be reclusive, avoiding publicity to such an extent that he did not collect either of his two Booker Prizes in person. The South African writer Rian Malan has said: Asked about this comment in an email interview, Coetzee replied, \\"I have met Rian Malan only once in my life. He does not know me and is not qualified to talk about my character.\\"Quoted in J.C. Kannemeyer (2012), J.M. Coetzee: A Life in Writing, Scribe, p. 583. Because of his reclusiveness, signed copies of Coetzee's fiction are highly prized. Recognising this, he was a key figure in the establishment of Oak Tree Press's First Chapter Series, which produces limited-edition signed works by literary greats to raise money for the child victims and orphans of the African HIV/AIDS crisis. =Family and personal life= Coetzee married Philippa Jubber in 1963. They divorced in 1980. They have a son, Nicolas (born 1966), and a daughter, Gisela (born 1968). Nicolas died in an accident in 1989 at the age of 23. On 6 March 2006, Coetzee became an Australian citizen, and it has been argued that his \\"acquired 'Australianness' is deliberately adopted and stressed\\" by Australians. Coetzee's younger brother, the journalist David Coetzee, died in 2010. His partner, Dorothy Driver, is an academic at the University of Adelaide.

It originally referred to a remote rural area, but now, is often applied to an out-of-the-way area considered backward and unsophisticated by city-folk. It can also refer to a mountain. Origins The expression was introduced to English by U.S. military personnel fighting in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War (1899-1902). It derives from the Tagalog word \\"bund√≥k\\",From Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *bunduk (\\"higher ground\\"), ultimately from Proto-Austronesian *bunduk (\\"higher ground\\") which means \\"mountain\\". According to military historian Paul A. Kramer, the term originally had \\"connotations of bewilderment and confusion\\", due to the guerrilla warfare in which the soldiers were engaged. In the Philippines, the word bund√≥k is also a colloquialism referring to rural inland areas, which are usually mountainous and difficult to access, as most major cities and settlements in the Philippines are located in lowlands or near the coastline. Equivalent terms include the Spanish-derived probinsiya (\\"province\\") and the Cebuano term bukid (\\"mountain\\").From Proto-Austronesian *bukij (\\"mountain\\", \\"forested inland mountain areas\\")\\"What A English\\" by Jon Joaquin. When used generally, the term refers to a rustic or uncivilized area. When referring to people (taga-bundok or probinsiyano in Tagalog; taga-bukid in Cebuano; English: \\"someone who comes from the mountains/provinces\\"), it acquires a derogatory connotation of a stereotype of unsophisticated, ignorant, and illiterate country people.Competence Matters: the Peter Principle Strikes the Philippines Over and Over Expanded meanings The term evolved into American slang to refer to the countryside or isolated rural/wilderness area, regardless of topography or vegetation. Similar slang or colloquial words are \\"the sticks\\", \\"the wops\\", \\"the backblocks\\", or \\"Woop Woop\\" in Australia, \\"the wop-wops\\" in New Zealand, \\"bundu\\" in South Africa (etymologically unrelated to \\"boondocks\\" or \\"bundok\\"), and \\"out in the tules\\" in California. The diminutive \\"boonies\\" can be heard in films about the Vietnam War such as Brian De Palma's Casualties of War (1989) used by American soldiers to designate rural areas of Vietnam.

It was probably created between 650 and 700. The place of creation may perhaps have been Durrow Abbey in Ireland or a monastery in Northumbria in northeastern England (where the monastery at Lindisfarne would be the likely candidate) or perhaps Iona Abbey in western Scotland‚Äîthe place of origin has been debated by historians for decades without a consensus emerging.Meehan, 17-22, who seems to give Ireland the edge; Wilson, 33-36, who favours Northumbria. Both discuss the views of other scholars. Some suggest the Book of Durrow was brought to Durrow Abbey from Britain by monks who were fleeing Viking attacks in Britain. The Book of Durrow was probably at Durrow Abbey by 916. Today it is in the Library of Trinity College Dublin (TCD MS 57). Description It is the oldest extant complete illuminated Insular gospel book, for example predating the Book of Kells by over a century. The text includes the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, plus several pieces of prefatory matter and canon tables. Its pages measure 245 by 145 mm and there are 248 vellum folios. It contains a large illumination programme including six extant carpet pages, a full page miniature of the four evangelists' symbols, four full page miniatures, each containing a single evangelist symbol, and six pages with significant decorated initials and text. It is written in majuscule insular script (in effect the block capitals of the day), with some lacunae. The page size has been reduced by subsequent rebindings, and most leaves are now single when unbound, where many or most would originally have been in \\"bifolia\\" or folded pairs. It is clear that some pages have been inserted in the wrong places. The main significance of this is that it is unclear if there was originally a seventh carpet page. Now Matthew does not have one, but there is, most unusually, one as the last page in the book. Perhaps there were only ever six: one at the start of the book with a cross, one opposite the next page with the four symbols (as now), and one opposite each individual symbol at the start of each gospel.Meehan, 30-38 Otherwise the original programme of illumination seems to be complete, which is rare in manuscripts of this age. In the standard account of the development of the Insular gospel book, the Book of Durrow follows the fragmentary Northumbrian Gospel Book Fragment (Durham Cathedral Library, A. II. 10.) and precedes the Book of Lindisfarne, which was begun around 700. Illumination Carpet page with interlaced animals The illumination of the book shows especially well the varied origins of the Insular style, and has been a focus for the intense art- historical discussion of the issue. One thing that is clear is that the artist was unused to representing the human figure; his main attempt, the Man symbol for Matthew, has been described as a \\"walking buckle\\".Wilson, 34, quoting another writer (unnamed). Apart from Anglo-Saxon metalwork, and Coptic and Syriac manuscript illustrations, the figure has been compared to a bronze figure with a panel of geometric enamel on his trunk, from a bucket found in Norway.Meehan, 53 & illustration 35 The animal iconography derives from Germanic zoomorphic designs; the depictions of the Jesus and the Evangelists from Pictish stones. The geometric borders and the carpet pages cause more disagreement. The interlace, like that of the Durham fragment, is mostly large compared to the Book of Lindisfarne, but the extreme level of detail found in later Insular books begins here in the Celtic spirals and other curvilinear decoration used in initials and in sections of carpet pages. The page illustrated at left has animal interlace around the sides that is drawn from Germanic Migration Period Animal Style II, as found for example in the Anglo- Saxon jewellery at Sutton Hoo, and on the Benty Grange hanging bowl. But the circular panel in the centre seems, although not as precisely as other parts of the book, to draw on Celtic sources, although the three white circles at the edge recall Germanic metalwork studs in enamel or other techniques. The Book of Durrow is unusual in that it does not use the traditional scheme, usual since Saint Jerome, for assigning the symbols to the Evangelists. Each Gospel begins with an Evangelist's symbol ‚Äì a man for Matthew, an eagle for Mark (not the lion traditionally used), a calf for Luke and a lion for John (not the eagle traditionally used). This is also known as the pre-Vulgate arrangement. Each evangelist symbol, except the Man of Matthew is followed by a carpet page, followed by the initial page. This missing carpet page is assumed to have existed. A first possibility is that it was lost, and a second that it is in fact folio 3, which features swirling abstract decoration. Where the four symbols appear together on folio 2r they appear in the normal order if read clockwise, and in the pre-Vulgate order if read anti-clockwise, which may be deliberate.Meehan, 43-44 The first letter of the text is enlarged and decorated, with the following letters surrounded by dots. Parallels with metalwork can be noted in the rectangular body of St Matthew, which looks like a millefiori decoration, and in details of the carpet pages. There is a sense of space in the design of all the pages of the Book of Durrow. Open vellum balances intensely decorated areas. Animal interlace of very high quality appears on folio 192v. Other motifs include spirals, triskeles, ribbon plaits and circular knots in the carpet pages and borders around the Four Evangelists.

This probably relates to the belief that Colum Cille (Saint Columba) had created the book, and its date and authenticity is unclear. Twelve days is a plausible time to scribe one gospel, but not four, still less with all the decoration.Meehan, 26-28, 82 The earliest known cumdach, or metalwork reliquary for a book (probably an Irish innovation), was made to house and protect the Book of Durrow at the behest of King of Ireland Flann Sinna (879-916), and believed to be a relic of Colum Cille. =Preservation= A blank page contains a note by the Durrow scribe Flannchad Ua hEolais, probably from around 1100, relating to a legal dispute. The shrine was lost in the 17th century, but its appearance, including an inscription recording the king's patronage, is recorded in a note from 1677, now bound into the book as folio IIv, although other inscriptions are not transcribed. Once in the shrine it was probably rarely if ever removed for use as a book.Meehan, 13 In the 16th century, when Durrow Abbey was dissolved, the book went into private ownership. It was borrowed and studied by James Ussher, probably when he was Bishop of Meath from 1621‚Äì1623. It managed to survive during that period despite at least one section of it being immersed in water by a farmer to create holy water to cure his cows. In the period 1661 to 1682 it was given to the library at Trinity College, together with the Book of Kells, by Henry Jones while he was Bishop of Meath. The shrine and cover was lost during the occupation by troops in 1689.Meehan, 13-16 The five pound note of the \\"Series B\\" Irish banknotes contained an image from the book.

Classical Greek and Latin The form is two hendecasyllabic verses, and a third verse beginning the same way and continuing with five additional syllables (given as the stanza's fourth verse in ancient and modern editions, and known as the Adonic or adonean line). Using \\"‚Äì\\" for a long syllable, \\"‚à™\\" for a short syllable, and \\"x\\" for an \\"anceps\\" (free syllable), and displaying the Adonic as a fourth line:For long or anceps in the last position of the adonean, see e.g. Sappho fr. 31, vv. 4, 8, 12, 16. fr. 32. and Horatius I. 25, vv. 8, 12, 16, 20. :‚Äì ‚à™ ‚Äì x ‚Äì ‚à™ ‚à™ ‚Äì ‚à™ ‚Äì ‚Äì :‚Äì ‚à™ ‚Äì x ‚Äì ‚à™ ‚à™ ‚Äì ‚à™ ‚Äì ‚Äì :‚Äì ‚à™ ‚Äì x ‚Äì ‚à™ ‚à™ ‚Äì ‚à™ ‚Äì ‚Äì :‚Äì ‚à™ ‚à™ ‚Äì ‚Äì =Sappho= While Sappho used several metrical forms for her poetry, she is most famous for the Sapphic stanza. Her poems in this meter (collected in Book I of the ancient edition) ran to 330 stanzas, a significant part of her complete works (and of her surviving poetry: fragments 1-42). It is not clear if she created it or if it was already part of the Aeolic tradition; according to Marius Victorinus (Ars grammatica 6.161 Keil), it was invented by Alcaeus but then used more frequently by Sappho, and so is more strongly associated with her. Sappho's most famous poem in this metre is Sappho 31, written in the Aeolic Greek dialect of her home island of Lesbos, which begins as follows: : : : : : : : : :\\"That man seems to me to be equal to the gods :who is sitting opposite you :and hears you nearby :speaking sweetly.\\" =Other poets= Sappho's contemporary and countryman, Alcaeus of Mytilene, also used the Sapphic stanza. A few centuries later, the Roman poet Catullus admired Sappho's work and used the Sapphic meter in two poems, Catullus 11 and Catullus 51. The latter is a rough translation of Sappho 31. Sapphics were also used by Horace in several of his Odes, including Ode 1.22: The Sapphic stanza was one of the few classical quantitative meters to survive into the Middle Ages, when accentual rather than quantitative prosody became the norm. Many Latin hymns were written in Sapphic stanzas, including the famous hymn for St John the Baptist which gave the original names of the sol-fa scale: Ut queant laxis resonare fibris/ Mira gestorum famuli tuorum/ Solve polluti labii reatum/ Sancte Joannes Modern adaptations =English= Though some English poets attempted quantitative effects in their verse, quantity is not phonemic in English. So imitations of the Sapphic stanza are typically structured by replacing long with stressed syllables, and short with unstressed syllables (and often additional alterations, as exemplified below). The Sapphic stanza was imitated in English, using a line articulated into three sections (stressed on syllables 1, 5, and 10) as the Greek and Latin would have been, by Algernon Charles Swinburne in a poem he simply called Sapphics: So the goddess fled from her place, with awful Sound of feet and thunder of wings around her; While behind a clamour of singing women :Severed the twilight. Thomas Hardy chose to open his first verse collection Wessex Poems and other verses 1898 with \\"The Temporary the All,\\" a poem in Sapphics, perhaps as a declaration of his skill and as an encapsulation of his personal experience. Change and chancefulness in my flowering youthtime, Set me sun by sun near to one unchosen; Wrought us fellowly, and despite divergence, :Friends interblent us. Rudyard Kipling wrote a tribute to William Shakespeare in Sapphics called \\"The Craftsman\\". He hears the line articulated into four, with stresses on syllables 1, 4, 6, and 10 (called a 'schoolboy error' by classical scholar L. P. Wilkinson, arising from a misunderstanding of Horace's regularisation of the 4th syllable as a long and his frequent use of the 5th-element caesura in his Sapphics). His poem begins: Once, after long-drawn revel at The Mermaid, He to the overbearing Boanerges Jonson, uttered (if half of it were liquor :Blessed be the vintage!) Allen Ginsberg also experimented with the form: Red cheeked boyfriends tenderly kiss me sweet mouthed under Boulder coverlets winter springtime hug me naked laughing & telling girl friends :gossip til autumn Isaac Watts penned \\"The Day of Judgment\\" subtitled An Ode Attempted in English Sapphic (here are the third and fourth stanzas, the full poem is at this link): Such shall the noise be and the wild disorder, (If things eternal may be like these earthly) Such the dire terror, when the great Archangel :Shakes the creation, Tears the strong pillars of the vault of heaven, Breaks up old marble, the repose of princes; See the graves open, and the bones arising, :Flames all around 'em! Australian Classicist and poet John Lee wrote a Sapphic stanza about the impossibility of writing Sapphic stanzas in English: Making Sapphics isn't that easy, shackling Our reluctant language with trochees. Since you First begot them, songstress of Lesbos, keep them. :I'll never write them. (the poem exists also in a Latin version). The Australian poet John Tranter has also written a poem (\\"Writing in the Manner of Sappho\\") in two Sapphic stanzas about the difficulty of writing Sapphics in English: Writing Sapphics well is a tricky business. Lines begin and end with a pair of trochees; in between them dozes a dactyl, rhythm :rising and falling, like a drunk asleep at a party. Ancient Greek ‚Äî the language seemed to be made for Sapphics, not a worry; anyone used to English :finds it a bastard. The Oxford classicist Armand D'Angour has created mnemonics to illustrate the difference between Sapphics heard as 1) a four-beat line (as in Kipling) and 2) in the (correct) three-beat measure, as follows: 1\\\\. Four- beat: Conquering Sappho's not an easy business: Masculine ladies cherish independence. Only good music penetrates the souls of :Lesbian artists. 2\\\\. Three-beat: Independent metre is overrated: What's the point if nobody knows the dance-form? Wisely, Sappho chose to create a stately :regular stanza. Notable contemporary Sapphic poems include \\"Sapphics for Patience\\" by Annie Finch, \\"Dusk: July\\" by Marilyn Hacker, \\"Buzzing Affy\\" (a translation of \\"An Ode to Aphrodite\\") by Adam Lowe, and \\"Sapphics Against Anger\\" by Timothy Steele. =Other languages= The Sapphic stanza has been very popular in Polish literature since the 16th century. It was used by many poets. Sebastian Klonowic wrote a long poem, Flis, using the form.Lucylla Pszczo≈Çowska,Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc≈Çaw 1997, p.77. The formula of 11/11/11/5 syllablesStanis≈Çaw Sierotwi≈Ñski, S≈Çownik termin√≥w literackich, Wroc≈Çaw 1966, p.258. was so attractive that it can be found in other forms, among others the S≈Çowacki stanza: 11a/11b/11a/5b/11c/11c.Wiktor Jaros≈Çaw Darasz, Ma≈Çy przewodnik po wierszu polskim Krak√≥w 2003, p.145-146. In 1653, Paul Gerhardt used the Sapphic strophe format in the text of his sacred morning song \\"Lobet den Herren alle, die ihn ehren\\". Sapphic stanza was often used in poetry of German Humanism and Baroque. It is also used in hymns such as \\"Herzliebster Jesu\\" by Johann Heermann.

Page with portrait of Abbot Adalpertus The adoration of the Lamb from the Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram. Charles the Bald The Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram (Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Clm 14000) is a 9th-century illuminated Gospel Book. It is named after Emmeram of Regensburg and lavishly illuminated. The cover of the codex is decorated with gems and relief figures in gold, and can be precisely dated to 870, and is an important example of Carolingian art, as well of one of very few surviving treasure bindings of this date. The upper cover of the Lindau Gospels is probably a product of the same workshop, though there are differences of style. This workshop is associated with the Holy Roman Emperor Charles II (the Bald), and often called his \\"Palace School\\". Its location (if it had a fixed one) remains uncertain and much discussed, but Saint-Denis Abbey outside Paris is one leading possibility.Lasko, 60-68 The Arnulf Ciborium (a miniature architectural ciborium rather than the vessel for hosts), now in the Munich Residenz, is the third major work in the group, along with the frame of an antique serpentine dish in the Louvre.Lasko, 64-65, 66-67; picture of the dish Recent scholars tend to group the Lindau Gospels and the Arnulf Ciborium in closer relation to each other than the Codex Aureus to either. History It was produced for the Holy Roman Emperor Charles II (the Bald) in 870 at his Carolingian Palace School. It is not known for certain where the Palace School was then based (after its previous base at St Martin's Abbey in Tours was destroyed in 853), but it had probably moved to the Basilica of St Denis outside Paris by the time of the Codex Aureus's production. Charles gave it to Arnulf of Carinthia. 11th century sources state it was produced in 893 and given to emperor Arnulf of Carinthia, who in turn donated it to St. Emmeram Abbey, then under abbot Tuto. On secularisation in 1811 it was given to the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in Munich (catalogue reference Clm 14000). Content It was written out by the monks Liuthard and Beringer. Seven full-page miniatures show the four evangelists, Charles the Bald enthroned, the Adoration of the Lamb and a Christ in Majesty. It also includes twelve canon tables, ten illuminated initials and incipits. The text is written in golden uncial letters, with each page framed. It measures 420 mm by 330 mm and has 126 vellum folios. The cover is handmade of gold, and decorated with precious gemstones, sapphires, emeralds, and pearls. At the centre of the cover appears Christ in Majesty, in repouss√© relief, seated on the globe of the world and holding on his knee a book inscribed with the words: \\"I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No man cometh to the Father, but by me.\\" The inclusion of this inscription again identifies the Gospel Book with Christ. The verse makes equal sense if we read the speaker as Christ or as the Gospel Book. Surrounding Christ outside a frame are four seated evangelist portraits, above or below each of which is a scene from their Gospel. Reading from top left, clockwise, these are: Christ and the Adulterous Woman, the Expulsion of the Money-lenders from the Temple, Healing of the Blind Man, Healing of the Leper.Lasko, p. 64 and note 26 on p.271 During the Carolingian era, King Charlemagne believed in the spiritual powers of gemstones and minerals, and their magical connection to heaven. He believed sapphires symbolized an image of heaven, heavenly virtues, and eternal life. Charlemagne passed down his interest in the spiritual qualities of gemstones to his grandson, Charles the Bald, who ordered the Codex Aureus and Lindau Gospels to be written in 870. The artisans created the covers with emeralds, sapphires, rubies, garnets, agate, and pearls. The standard of the work is extremely refined, with each of the gems in a setting that rises up from the plane of the cover and is decorated with fine detail. The \\"claws\\" holding the gems in place are minutely formed as acanthus leaves; earlier jewelled metalwork usually used plain \\"claw\\"-type settings.Lasko, 64-65 According to the Book of Exodus in the Bible, God was in heaven standing on a street paved with sapphires, ‚ÄúAnd they saw the God of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were a pavement of sapphire stone, like the very heaven for clearness.‚Äù (Exodus 24: 9-10) The elaborate and costly decoration of the cover is meant to glorify the Word of God.

Concert pitch is the pitch reference to which a group of musical instruments are tuned for a performance. Concert pitch may vary from ensemble to ensemble, and has varied widely over music history. The most common modern tuning standard uses 440 Hz for A above middle C as a reference note, with other notes being set relative to it. In the literature this is also called international standard pitch. The term \\"concert pitch\\" is also used to distinguish between the \\"written\\" (or \\"nominal\\"), and \\"sounding\\" (or \\"real\\") notes of a transposing instrument, i.e. concert pitch may refer to the sounding pitch on a non-transposing instrument. Music for transposing instruments is transposed into different keys from that of non-transposing instruments. For example, playing a written C on a B clarinet or trumpet produces a non-transposing instrument's B. This pitch is referred to as \\"concert B\\". Modern standard concert pitch The A above middle C is often set at 440 Hz. Historically, this A has been tuned to a variety of higher and lower pitches. History of pitch standards in Western music Historically, various standards have been used to fix the pitch of notes at certain frequencies. Various systems of musical tuning have also been used to determine the relative frequency of notes in a scale. =Pre-19th century= Until the 19th century, there was no coordinated effort to standardize musical pitch, and the levels across Europe varied widely. Pitches did not just vary from place to place, or over time‚Äîpitch levels could vary even within the same city. The pitch used for an English cathedral organ in the 17th century, for example, could be as much as five semitones lower than that used for a domestic keyboard instrument in the same city. Even within one church, the pitch used could vary over time because of the way organs were tuned. Generally, the end of an organ pipe would be hammered inwards to a cone, or flared outwards, to raise or lower the pitch. When the pipe ends became frayed by this constant process they were all trimmed down, thus raising the overall pitch of the organ. From the early 18th century, pitch could be also controlled with the use of tuning forks (invented in 1711), although again there was variation. For example, a tuning fork associated with Handel, dating from 1740, is pitched at A = while a later one from 1780 is pitched at A = about a quarter-tone lower. A tuning fork that belonged to Ludwig van Beethoven around 1800, now in the British Library, is pitched at A = , well over a half-tone higher. Overall, there was a tendency towards the end of the 18th century for the frequency of the A above middle C to be in the range of to The frequencies quoted here are based on modern measurements and would not have been precisely known to musicians of the day. Although Mersenne had made a rough determination of sound frequencies as early as the 17th century, such measurements did not become scientifically accurate until the 19th century, beginning with the work of German physicist Johann Scheibler in the 1830s. The term formerly used for the unit of pitch, cycle per second (CPS) was renamed the hertz (Hz) in the 20th century in honor of Heinrich Hertz. =Pitch inflation= During historical periods when instrumental music rose in prominence (relative to the voice), there was a continuous tendency for pitch levels to rise. This \\"pitch inflation\\" seemed largely a product of instrumentalists competing with each other, each attempting to produce a brighter, more \\"brilliant\\", sound than that of their rivals. (In string instruments, this is not all acoustic illusion: when tuned up, they actually sound objectively brighter because the higher string tension results in larger amplitudes for the harmonics.) This tendency was also prevalent with wind instrument manufacturers, who crafted their instruments to play generally at a higher pitch than those made by the same craftsmen years earlier.\\"History of Pitch ‚Äì The Diapason Normal\\", capionlarsen.com On at least two occasions, pitch inflation had become so severe that reform became needed. At the beginning of the 17th century, Michael Praetorius reported in his encyclopedic Syntagma musicum that pitch levels had become so high that singers were experiencing severe throat strain and lutenists and viol players were complaining of snapped strings. The standard voice ranges he cites show that the pitch level of his time, at least in the part of Germany where he lived, was at least a minor third higher than today's. Solutions to this problem were sporadic and local, but generally involved the establishment of separate standards for voice and organ () and for chamber ensembles (). Where the two were combined, as for example in a cantata, the singers and instrumentalists might perform from music written in different keys. This system kept pitch inflation at bay for some two centuries. The advent of the orchestra as an independent (as opposed to accompanying) ensemble brought pitch inflation to the fore again. The rise in pitch during this time can be seen reflected in tuning forks. An 1815 tuning fork from the Dresden opera house gives A = , while an 1826 fork from the same opera house gives A = . At La Scala in Milan, the A above middle C rose as high as . =19th- and 20th-century standards= A vintage silver-plated Conn New Wonder Series 2 alto saxophone, made in Elkhart, Indiana, USA. The serial number 197155 dates the instrument to 1927. The 'H' below the serial number indicates that it is a \\"High Pitch\\" (A=456 Hertz) instrument. A more modern \\"Low Pitch\\" (A=440 Hertz) saxophone would have the letter 'L' or 'LP' below the serial number The strongest opponents of the upward tendency in pitch were singers, who complained that it was putting a strain on their voices. Largely due to their protests, the French government passed a law on February 16, 1859, which set the A above middle C at 435 Hz. This was the first attempt to standardize pitch on such a scale, and was known as the diapason normal. It became quite a popular pitch standard outside France as well, and has also been known at various times as French pitch, continental pitch or international pitch (the last of these not to be confused with the 1939 \\"international standard pitch\\" described below). An 1885 conference in Vienna established this value among Italy, Austria, Hungary, Russia, Prussia, Saxony, Sweden and W√ºrttemberg. This was then eventually included in the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. The diapason normal resulted in middle C being tuned at about . An alternative pitch standard known as philosophical or scientific pitch fixes middle C at (that is, 28 Hz), which results the A above it being approximately in equal temperament tuning. The appeal of this system is its mathematical idealism (the frequencies of all the Cs being powers of two).Funk & Wagnalls New Encyclopedia. Funk & Wagnalls, 1983 This system never received the same official recognition as the French A = 435 Hz and has not been widely used. This tuning has been promoted unsuccessfully by the LaRouche movement's Schiller Institute under the name Verdi tuning since Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi had proposed a slight lowering of the French tuning system. However, the Schiller Institute's recommended tuning for A of 432 Hz is for the Pythagorean ratio of 27:16, rather than the logarithmic ratio of equal temperament tuning. British attempts at standardisation in the 19th century gave rise to the old philharmonic pitch standard of about A = 452 Hz (different sources quote slightly different values), replaced in 1896 by the considerably \\"deflated\\" new philharmonic pitch at A = 439 Hz. The high pitch was maintained by Sir Michael Costa for the Crystal Palace Handel Festivals, causing the withdrawal of the principal tenor Sims Reeves in 1877,J. Sims Reeves, The Life of Sims Reeves, written by himself (Simpkin Marshall, London 1888), 242‚Äì252. though at singers' insistence the Birmingham Festival pitch was lowered (and the organ retuned) at that time. At the Queen's Hall in London, the establishment of the diapason normal for the Promenade Concerts in 1895 (and retuning of the organ to A = 435.5 at 15 ¬∞C (59 ¬∞F), to be in tune with A = 439 in a heated hall) caused the Royal Philharmonic Society and others (including the Bach Choir, and the Felix Mottl and Arthur Nikisch concerts) to adopt the continental pitch thereafter.H.J. Wood, My Life of Music (Gollancz, London 1938) Chapters XIV and XV. In England the term low pitch was used from 1896 onward to refer to the new Philharmonic Society tuning standard of A = 439 Hz at 68 ¬∞F, while \\"high pitch\\" was used for the older tuning of A = 452.4 Hz at 60 ¬∞F. Although the larger London orchestras were quick to conform to the new, low pitch, provincial orchestras continued using the high pitch until at least the 1920s, and most brass bands were still using the high pitch in the mid-1960s. Highland pipe bands continue to use an even sharper tuning, around A = 470‚Äì480 Hz, over a semitone higher than A440. As a result, bagpipes are often perceived as playing in B despite being notated in A (as if they were transposing instruments in D-flat), and are often tuned to match B brass instruments when the two are required to play together. The Stuttgart Conference of 1834 recommended C264 (A440) as the standard pitch based on Scheibler's studies with his Tonometer. reprint of 1894 ed. For this reason A440 has been referred to as Stuttgart pitch or Scheibler pitch. In 1939, an international conference recommended that the A above middle C be tuned to 440 Hz, now known as concert pitch. As a technical standard this was taken up by the International Organization for Standardization in 1955 and reaffirmed by them in 1975 as ISO 16. The difference between this and the diapason normal is due to confusion over the temperature at which the French standard should be measured. The initial standard was A = , but this was superseded by A = 440 Hz, possibly because 439 Hz was difficult to reproduce in a laboratory since 439 is a prime number. Current concert pitches Despite such confusion, A = 440 Hz is the only official standard and is widely used around the world. Many orchestras in the United Kingdom adhere to this standard as concert pitch.Franz Nistl, Table of European orchestra tunings ‚Äì Europe E‚ÄìSK In the United States some orchestras use A = 440 Hz, while others, such as the New York Philharmonic, use A = 442 Hz.Franz Nistl, Table of orchestra tunings ‚Äì Africa, America, Asia, Oceania The latter is also often used as a tuning frequency in Europe, especially in Denmark, France, Hungary, Italy, Norway and Switzerland. Nearly all modern symphony orchestras in Germany and Austria and many in other countries in continental Europe (such as Russia and Spain) tune to A = 443 Hz. In practice most orchestras tune to a note given out by the oboe, and most oboists use an electronic tuning device when playing the tuning note. Some orchestras tune using an electronic tone generator. When playing with fixed-pitch instruments such as the piano, the orchestra will generally tune to them‚Äîa piano will normally have been tuned to the orchestra's normal pitch. Overall, it is thought that the general trend since the middle of the 20th century has been for standard pitch to rise, though it has been rising far more slowly than it has in the past. Some orchestras like the Berlin Philharmonic now use a slightly lower pitch (443 Hz) than their highest previous standard (445 Hz). Many modern ensembles which specialize in the performance of Baroque music have agreed on a standard of A = 415 Hz. An exact equal-tempered semitone lower than 440 Hz would be 415.30 Hz; this is rounded to the nearest integer. In principle this allows for playing along with modern fixed-pitch instruments if their parts are transposed down a semitone. It is, however, common performance practice, especially in the German Baroque idiom, to tune certain works to , approximately a semitone higher than 440 Hz (460‚Äì470 Hz) (e.g., Pre-Leipzig period cantatas of Bach).Oxford Composer Companion JS Bach, pp. 369‚Äì372. Oxford University Press, 1999 Orchestras in Cuba typically use A436 as the pitch so that strings, which are difficult to obtain, last longer. In 2015 American pianist Simone Dinnerstein brought attention to this issue and later traveled to Cuba with strings donated by friends. = Controversial claims for 432 Hz = Particularly in the beginning of the 21st century, many websites and online videos have been published arguing for the adoption of the 432 Hz tuning instead of the predominant 440 Hz. These claims also include conspiracy theories related to Nazis having favored the 440 Hz tuning.

It was founded in 1999 by the conductor Daniel Barenboim and academic Edward Said, and named after an anthology of poems by Goethe. Martha Argerich, pianist and longtime performing partner of Barenboim, was named an honorary member of the orchestra in 2015. In 2016, the Barenboim-Said Akademie was established in Berlin, Germany, as a state-accredited music conservatory offering Bachelor of Music degrees and Artist Diplomas. The Akademie, whose president is Daniel Barenboim, is based on the founding aims of the West‚ÄìEastern Divan Orchestra. History The Argentine-Israeli conductor Daniel Barenboim and the late Palestinian-American academic Edward Said founded the orchestra in 1999, and named the ensemble after an anthology of poems by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The first orchestra workshop was in Weimar, Germany, in 1999, after the organisation had received over 200 applications from Arab music students. Barenboim has also expressed interest in musicians from Iran (a non-Arab country but in conflict with Israel) and allocating three chairs for Iranian musicians to play in the orchestra each year. In 2016, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon designated the orchestra as a United Nations Global Advocate for Cultural Understanding, praising the orchestra's push for peace and unity. =Performances= The orchestra under Barenboim, in the presence of Italian President and Mrs. Giorgio Napolitano, performed for Pope Benedict XVI at the courtyard of the Apostolic Palace of Castel Gandolfo 11 July 2012, the abbot Saint Benedict of Nursia's (the founder of the Benedictines) feast day, and thus the name day of the Pope. The West‚ÄìEastern Divan participated in the 9th Gwangju Biennale in 2012. The orchestra, conducted by Barenboim, performed the complete Beethoven symphonic cycle at The Proms in July 2012 ‚Äì the first time all nine symphonies were performed under a single conductor in a single Prom season since Henry Wood did so in 1942. Since 2011, the orchestra has annually given a concert at Berlin's Waldb√ºhne. Aims The aim of the West‚ÄìEastern Divan Orchestra is to promote understanding between Israelis and Palestinians and pave the way for a peaceful and fair solution of the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. Barenboim himself has spoken of the ensemble as follows: > \\"The Divan is not a love story, and it is not a peace story. It has very > flatteringly been described as a project for peace. It isn't. It's not going > to bring peace, whether you play well or not so well. The Divan was > conceived as a project against ignorance. A project against the fact that it > is absolutely essential for people to get to know the other, to understand > what the other thinks and feels, without necessarily agreeing with it. I'm > not trying to convert the Arab members of the Divan to the Israeli point of > view, and [I'm] not trying to convince the Israelis to the Arab point of > view. But I want to ‚Äì and unfortunately I am alone in this now that Edward > died a few years ago ‚Äì ...create a platform where the two sides can disagree > and not resort to knives.\\" One of the young musicians of the orchestra reinforced this point: > \\"Barenboim is always saying his project is not political. But one of the > really great things is that this is a political statement by both sides. It > is more important not for people like myself, but for people to see that it > is possible to sit down with Arab people and play. The orchestra is a human > laboratory that can express to the whole world how to cope with the other.\\" Andalucia The orchestra has performed around the world. It has an annual summer school in Seville. Since 2002, the Junta de Andaluc√≠a (Regional Government of Andalusia) and a private foundation have provided a base for the ensemble in Seville, Spain. Young musicians from Spain now also take part in the orchestra. The West‚ÄìEastern Divan Workshop takes place during several weeks each summer in Andalucia. Once the working period is over, the concert tour of the West‚ÄìEastern Divan Orchestra starts. The orchestra has been awarded several prizes since its creation, among them the Pr√≠ncipe de Asturias concord award in 2002 for Said and Barenboim, and the Premium Imperiale awarded by the Japan Arts Association. In 2004, the Barenboim‚ÄìSaid Foundation, based in Seville and financed by the Junta de Andaluc√≠a was established with the purpose of developing several education through music projects based on the principles of coexistence and dialogue promoted by Said and Barenboim. In addition to managing the orchestra, the Barenboim‚ÄìSaid Foundation assists with other projects such as the Academy of Orchestral Studies, the Musical Education in Palestine project and the Early Childhood Musical Education Project in Seville. Media A film by Paul Smaczny about the orchestra, Knowledge is the Beginning, won the Emmy Award for best documentary related to arts of 2006. In 2007, the orchestra received the Praemium Imperiale Grant for Young Artists. It has recorded for the Teldec label. The current concertmaster is , the son of Daniel Barenboim.

The name is derived from the phrase \\"so, sue me!\\" because of a long running court battle with Apple Corps, the similarly named music company, regarding the use of music in Apple Inc.'s computer products. History Sosumi is a short xylophone sample, which gained notoriety in computer folklore as a defiant pun name, in response to a long-running Apple Corps v. Apple Computer trademark conflict. The sound has been included in all subsequent versions of Mac OS. During the development of System 7, the two companies concluded a settlement agreement from an earlier dispute when Apple added a sound synthesis chip to its Apple IIGS machine. As a result, Apple Computer was prohibited from using its trademark on \\"creative works whose principal content is music\\". When new sounds for System 7 were created, the sounds were reviewed by Apple's Legal Department who objected that the new sound alert \\"chime\\" had a name that was \\"too musical\\", under the recent settlement. Jim Reekes, the creator of the new sound alerts for System 7, had grown frustrated with the legal scrutiny and first quipped it should be named \\"Let It Beep\\", a pun on \\"Let It Be\\". When someone remarked that that would not pass the Legal Department's approval, he remarked, \\"so sue me\\". After a brief reflection, he resubmitted the sound's name as sosumi (a homophone of \\"so sue me\\"). Careful to submit it in written form rather than spoken form to avoid pronunciation, he told the Legal Department that the name was Japanese and had nothing to do with music.Jim Reekes describing the origins of the sosumi name (Vimeo) In macOS Big Sur, the original chime was replaced with a different sample, which retained the \\"Sosumi\\" name.

Breaking the Ice was founded by Nathaniel and other European international business professionals, who are deeply convinced that people can overcome their differences by facing challenges together. In 2004, the foundation brought eight people from Israel and the Palestinian territories together in a month-long sailing and mountain climbing expedition to Antarctica. Their journey to break the ice received the support and public endorsements of Nobel Peace Prize Laureates the Dalai Lama, Shimon Peres, Mikhail Gorbachev, Kofi Annan, and many more. Furthermore, their journey also received worldwide media coverage on channels like CNN, BBC, etc. as well as international newspapers. More than 553 million people in 59 countries and 25 languages followed the story of Breaking the Ice. Breaking the Ice is currently planning its next \\"peace mission\\" for March 2006 =The team= Men and women - Jews, Christians and Muslims - from Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Israel, Lebanon, the Palestinian territories and the United States will join together in mind, body and spirit to cross the Sahara Desert and the territories of five countries and cultures.

Gjon Buzuku (16th century) was an Albanian Catholic priest who wrote the first known printed book in Albanian. Gjon Buzuku was born in the village of Livari (Krajina, ) in the Bar district, close to Northern Albania (Kraj√´ is located on the shores of Skadar Lake), then Ottoman Empire. He probably lived in or near Venice, Italy. There are claims that he was the bishop of two dioceses in north Albania or that he was a monk. From March 20, 1554 to January 5, 1555 he wrote a translation of the Catholic missal into the Gheg dialect of Albanian. He published it as a book of 220 pages. The Apostolic Library in the Vatican holds the only known copy of the book. It is missing the frontispiece and the first 16 sheets, which explains why the title and year of publication of the work are not known. The book was discovered in 1740 by Gjon Nikoll√´ Kazazi, the archbishop of Skopje. In other libraries there are three photocopies from the original, one of them in Tirana. In 1996, the librarians were not able to locate the book, which had been used in 1984 for the last time. Eqrem √áabej wrote a monograph on the book in 1968. The dialect used in M√´shari was one of the main subjects of Selman Riza's works. The place the book was printed is thought to be either Venice or Shkod√´r. The book contains the liturgies of the main holidays. There are also texts of prayers and rituals and catechetical texts. Every page contains two columns. The initials are decorated. The grammar and the vocabulary are more archaic than in the Gheg text from the 17th century. The text is very valuable from the viewpoint of the history of language. The vocabulary is quite rich. The archaic text is easily read due to the circumstance that it is mainly a translation of known texts, in particular the Bible. Most of the Gospels of Matthew, Luke and John were translated in the book. It also contains passages from the Psalms, the Book of Isaiah, the Book of Jeremiah, the Letters to the Corinthians, and many illustrations. The orthography is peculiar. The Latin alphabet with some additional letters is used. The consequent character of orthography and grammar seems to indicate an earlier tradition of writing. In Albanian, the book is known as Meshari (The Missal). All we know about the author is from the book's colophon written by Buzuku himself in Albanian. Language used is a pre-runner to the Official Gheg Albanian Language. However, it is clear that the Gheg dialect was used. Even today one can hear words and expressions from older Mal√´sians that sound as if jumping from the pages of the missal.

The rind is reddish-orange, with a powdery mould on it. Since the 18th century, it has been coloured orange by adding annatto extract during manufacture. It is a cow's milk cheese, and is named after the county of Leicestershire, in England. Traditionally-made wheels are fairly firm and dry, with a friable texture and a slightly sweet, mellow flavour that becomes stronger as the cheese matures. Block-made cheeses are moister, and have a slightly sweet aftertaste and a creamy texture. The cheese has a slightly nutty taste. Versions sold in supermarkets are typically coloured with annatto, although it is possible to obtain Red Leicester without it. Although Red Leicester can be young or \\"old\\", aged anywhere from four to nine months, young Leicesters at the beginning of that range will be very mild: they often require at least six months to develop a tang. Farmhouse versions are also available. Farmhouse makers mature it in cloth (the old way) to allow better flavour development, whereas modern cheese makers use Vac-Pac to age Red Leicester.  History  The cheese was originally made on farms in Leicestershire with surplus milk, once all the Stilton desired was made. It was originally coloured with carrot or beetroot juice. It used to be called Leicestershire Cheese, but came to be called Red Leicester. This was to distinguish it from \\"White Leicester,\\" which was made to a national wartime recipe in the 1940s, due to rationing. When fresh, the fat content of Red Leicester cheese is generally 33 to 34%. Regulations require that minimum fat levels to be stated in terms of the \\"fat in dry matter\\" or FDM. This is because moisture levels decrease as cheese ages. FDM measures the amount of fat present in the solids, which includes protein, minerals, vitamins and salt. The minimum FDM listed for Red Leicester is generally 48%.

The event An event in preparation for eighteen months,\\"Key Issues in the 1992 Campaign\\", BBC News, Politics '97 the rally was held at the Sheffield Arena, an indoor sports venue in Sheffield, England. It was attended by 10,000 Labour Party members, including the entire shadow cabinet, and is reported to have cost some ¬£100,000 to stage. It was the idea of strategist Philip Gould,Obituary: \\"Lord Gould of Brookwood\\", telegraph.co.uk, 7 November 2011 who was involved in the subsequent successful election campaign of Bill Clinton later that year. The party leader, Neil Kinnock, was flown into the city by helicopter.Stephanie Barnard \\"Kinnock came and didn't conquer\\", BBC News Sheffield & South Yorkshire, 27 July 2009 The rally was modelled partly on American presidential campaign conventions, with sound and light performances on the stage and celebrity endorsements played on a large video screen. At one point in the proceedings, Kinnock and the shadow cabinet paraded to the stage from the back of the venue, passing through an increasingly enthusiastic audience, with the shadow cabinet being introduced with titles such as \\"The next Home Secretary\\" and \\"The next Prime Minister\\"; Labour had been in opposition for 13 years and had already lost three consecutive general elections to the Conservatives. This culminated in an emotional and animated Kinnock taking the podium and shouting four times \\"Well all right!\\",https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-39531021 which has often been re-broadcast since as an example of overconfident campaigning. Kinnock followed this by proclaiming \\"We'd better get some talking done here, serious talking.\\" Aftermath Although Labour's internal polls at the time suggested the event had little effect on the level of support for the party, media commentators, and some prominent Labour politicians, thought the rally came over as \\"triumphalist\\" to television viewers of subsequent news programmes. The election eight days later was a victory for the Conservatives, who finished 8% ahead of Labour in voting, but with a much smaller parliamentary majority than in 1987. It is widely regarded as one of the most surprising election results of the 20th century, as pollsters had predicted a narrow Labour majority or a hung parliament. Mirroring Labour's poll results, several analysts and major participants in the campaign believe it actually had little effect. Jim Parish, Senior Campaigns Officer for the Labour Party from 1985 to 1993 and an organiser of the rally, wrote: \\"The catastrophic 6‚Äì7 per cent drop in Labour support occurred before the rally and was ‚Äì I am reliably informed ‚Äì known in Sheffield that night.\\" Polls conducted in the final week of the campaign continued to show either the two main parties neck-and-neck or Labour slightly ahead, as they had done prior to the rally.

Like British, Irish and Dutch postcodes, Canada's postal codes are alphanumeric. They are in the format A1A 1A1, where A is a letter and 1 is a digit, with a space separating the third and fourth characters. As of October 2019, there were 876,445 postal codes using Forward Sortation Areas from A0A in Newfoundland to Y1A in the Yukon. Canada Post provides a free postal code look-up tool on its website, via its mobile application, and sells hard-copy directories and CD-ROMs. Many vendors also sell validation tools, which allow customers to properly match addresses and postal codes. Hard-copy directories can also be consulted in all post offices, and some libraries. When writing out the postal address for a location within Canada, the postal code follows the abbreviation for the province or territory.  History  = City postal zones = Numbered postal zones were first used in Toronto in 1925. Mail to a Toronto address in zone 5 would be addressed in this format: 37 Bloor Street West Toronto 5, OntarioNew dimensions in curriculum development: proceedings, Ontario Curriculum Institute, 1966, page 110 As of 1943, Toronto was divided into 14 zones, numbered from 1 to 15, except that 7 and 11 were unused, and there was a 2B zone.The Corpus Almanac of Canada, Volume 4, Corpus Publishers Services Limited, 1968, page 325 Postal zones were implemented in Montreal in 1944. By the early 1960s, other cities in Canada had been divided into postal zones, including Quebec, Ottawa, Winnipeg and Vancouver as well as Toronto and Montreal. For example, an address in Vancouver would be addressed as: 804 Robson Street, Vancouver 1, B.C. In the late 1960s, however, the Post Office began implementing a three-digit zone number scheme in major cities to replace existing one- and two-digit zone numbers, starting in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver.House of Commons Debates, 2 July 1969, Official Report, Volume 10, E. Cloutier, Queen's Printer and Controller of Stationery, 1969, page 10742 For example, an address in Metropolitan Toronto would be addressed as: 1253 Bay Street Toronto 185, OntarioThe Canadian Modern Language Review, Volume 29, Volume 4, Corpus Publishers Services Limited, 1968, page 325 Toronto's renumbering took effect 1 May 1969, accompanied by an advertising campaign under the slogan \\"Your number is up\\".House of Commons Debates, 8 July 1969, Official Report, Volume 10, E. Cloutier, Queen's Printer and Controller of Stationery, 1969, page 11004 However, with impending plans for a national postal code system, Postmaster General Eric Kierans announced that the Post Office would begin cancelling the new three-digit city zone system. Companies changed their mail addressing at their own expense, only to find the new zoning would prove to be short-lived. = Planning = As the largest Canadian cities grew in the 1950s and 1960s, the volume of mail passing through the country's postal system also grew, to billions of items by the 1950s and tens of billions of items by the mid-1960s. Consequently, it became progressively more difficult for employees who handsorted mail to memorize and keep track of all the individual letter- carrier routes within each city. New technology that allowed mail to be delivered faster also contributed to the pressure for these employees to properly sort the mail. A report tabled in the House of Commons in 1969 dealt with the expected impact of \\"environmental change\\" on the Post Office operations over the following 25 years. A key recommendation was the \\"establishment of a task force to determine the nature of the automation and mechanization the Post Office should adopt, which might include design of a postal code\\". In December 1969, Communications Minister Eric Kierans announced that a six-character postal code would be introduced, superseding the three- digit zone system. He later tabled a report in February 1970, entitled \\"A Canadian Public Address Postal Coding System\\", submitted by the firm of Samson, Belair, Simpson, Riddell Inc. = Implementation = The introduction of the postal code began with a test in Ottawa on 1 April 1971. Coding of Ottawa was followed by a provincial-level rollout of the system in Manitoba, and the system was gradually implemented in the rest of the country from 1972 to 1974, although the nationwide use of the code by the end of 1974 was only 38.2 per cent. The introduction of such a code system allowed Canada Post to easily speed up and simplify the flow of mail in the country, with sorting machines being able to handle 26,640 objects an hour. The Canadian Union of Postal Workers objected to the automated sorting system mainly because the wages of those who ran the new automated machines were much lower than those who had hand-sorted mail. The unions ended up staging job action and public information campaigns, with the message that they did not want people and business to use postal codes on their mail. The union declared 20 March 1975 National \\"Boycott the Postal Code\\" Day, also demanding a reduction in the work week from 40 to 30 hours. The boycott was called off in February 1976. One 1975 advertisement in the Toronto magazine Byliner generated controversy by showing a man writing a postal code on the bottom of a thonged woman with the following ditty: > \\"We're not 'stringing' you along, > Use postal codes ‚Äî you'll 'thing our 'thong', > Don't be cheeky ‚Äî you've all got 'em > Please include them on the bottom.\\"House of Commons Debates, Official > Report, Volume 7, E. Cloutier, Queen's Printer and Controller of Stationery, > 1975, page 6826 The advertisement was denounced as \\"sexist garbage\\" in the House of Commons by NDP MP John Rodriguez, prompting an apology from Postmaster General Bryce Mackasey. Canada was one of the last Western countries to implement a nationwide postal code system.  Components of a postal code  140px = Forward sortation areas = A forward sortation area (FSA) is a geographical region in which all postal codes start with the same three characters. The first letter of an FSA code denotes a particular \\"postal district\\", which, outside Quebec and Ontario, corresponds to an entire province or territory. The large populations of both Quebec and Ontario cause both provinces to be subdivided into three and five postal districts, respectively, and each has at least one urban area so populous that it has a dedicated postal district (\\"H\\" for the Montreal region, and \\"M\\" for Toronto). On the other hand, the low populations in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories (NWT) mean that even after Nunavut separated from the Northwest Territories and became its own territory in 1999, they continue to share a postal district. The digit identifies the FSA as urban or rural. A zero indicates a wide-area rural region; all other digits indicate urban areas. The second letter represents a specific rural region, an entire medium-sized city, or a section of a major metropolitan area. A directory of FSAs is provided, divided into separate articles by postal district. Individual FSA lists are in a tabular format, with the numbers (known as zones) going across the table and the second letter going down the table. The FSA lists specify all communities covered by each rural FSA. Medium-sized cities may have one dedicated FSA; larger cities have more than one FSA within their limits. For FSAs spanning more than one city, the city which is allocated the most codes in each such FSA is listed. For cities with a small number of FSAs (but more than one), the lists specify the relative location of each FSA in those cities. For cities with a large number of FSAs, applicable neighbourhoods and boroughs are specified. =Table of all postal codes= All Canadian postal codes are listed in the following links, organized by first letter. = Local delivery units = The last three characters denote a local delivery unit (LDU). An LDU denotes a specific single address or range of addresses, which can correspond to an entire small town, a significant part of a medium-sized town, a single side of a city block in larger cities, a single large building or a portion of a very large one, a single (large) institution such as a university or a hospital, or a business that receives large volumes of mail on a regular basis. LDUs ending in zero correspond to postal facilities, from post offices and small franchised retail postal outlets all the way up to sortation plants. In urban areas, LDUs may be specific postal carriers' routes. In rural areas where direct door-to-door delivery is not available, an LDU can describe a set of post office boxes or a rural route. LDU 9Z9 is used exclusively for Business Reply Mail. In rural FSAs, the first two characters are usually assigned in alphanumerical order by the name of each community. LDU 9Z0 refers to large regional distribution centre facilities, and is also used as a placeholder, appearing in some regional postmarks such as the \\"K0H 9Z0\\" which formerly appeared on purely local mail within the Kingston, Ontario, area.  Number of possible postal codes  Postal codes do not include the letters D, F, I, O, Q or U, and the first position also does not make use of the letters W or Z. This means the maximum number of FSAs available is 3,600. With 2,000 possible LDUs in each FSA, there is a theoretical limit of 7.2 million postal codes. The practical limit is a bit lower, as Canada Post reserves some FSAs for special functions, such as for test or promotional purposes, (e.g. the H0H 0H0 for Santa Claus, see below) as well as for sorting mail bound for destinations outside Canada. The current Statistics Canada estimate of over 830,000 active postal codes represents about 12% of the entire postal code \\"space\\", leaving more than ample room for expansion.  Urbanization  \\"Urbanization\\" is the name Canada Post uses to refer to the process where it replaces a rural postal code (a code with a zero as its second character) with urban postal codes. The vacated rural postal code can then be assigned to another community or retired. Canada Post decides when to urbanize a certain community when its population reaches a certain level, though different factors may also be involved. For example, in early 2008, the postal code G0N 3M0 (covering Sainte-Catherine-de-la- Jacques-Cartier, Fossambault-sur-le-Lac and Lac-Saint-Joseph, Quebec) was urbanized to postal codes beginning with G3N to remove ambiguities and confusions caused by similar street names. Unique among province-wide districts, New Brunswick (postal district E) is completely urbanized, its rural codes having been phased out.  Santa Claus  In 1974, staff at a Canada Post office in Montreal were noticing a considerable number of letters addressed to Santa Claus entering the postal system, and those letters were being treated as undeliverable. Since employees handling those letters did not want the writers (mostly young children) to be disappointed at the lack of response, they started answering the letters themselves. The amount of mail sent to Santa Claus increased every Christmas, to the point that Canada Post established an official Santa Claus letter-response program in 1983. By 2011, Santa's mail was being handled with the assistance of eleven thousand volunteers, mostly current or former postal workers, at multiple locations across CanadaNorth Pole elves ready to respond, North Shore News, 26 November 2008 devoting an average of twenty-one hours to this seasonal task. Approximately one million letters are addressed to Santa Claus each Christmas, including some originating outside Canada, and all of them are answered in the same language in which they are written. Canada Post introduced a special address for mail to Santa Claus, complete with its own postal code: In French, Santa's name translates as \\"Father Christmas\\", and mail is addressed to: The postal code H0H 0H0 was chosen for this special seasonal use as it reads \\"Ho ho ho\\". The H0- prefix is an anomaly: the 0 indicates a rural delivery zone, but H is used to designate Montreal, the second-largest city in Canada. As such, the H0- prefix is almost completely empty. H0M, assigned to the international Akwesasne tribal reserve on the Canada‚ÄìUS border, is the only other H0- postal code in active use. In 2013, Santa was dragged into the ongoing Arctic sovereignty debate to support Canadian territorial claims extending to the North Pole. In response to attacks from Conservative MP Paul Calandra, parliamentary secretary to then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Justin Trudeau, at the time leader of the third-party Liberals, stated \\"Everyone knows that Santa Claus is Canadian. His postal code is H0H 0H0.\\" Transition points to the Canadian Forces Postal Service For transition of mail from the civilian to the Canadian Forces Postal Service, the postal codes of the three military post offices on Canadian soil are used, depending on the final destination. * V9A 7N2 (BC): the Fleet Mail Offices (FMO) in Victoria * B3K 5X5 (NS): FMO in Halifax * K8N 5W6 (ON): the Canadian Forces Post Office (CFPO) in BellevilleInstructions for mailing overseas, Canadian Forces These postal codes each represent a number of military post offices abroad, which are specified not by postal code but by CFPO or FMO number. The LDUs in this case corresponding not so much to a physical as to a virtual delivery unit since mail is not delivered locally but is forwarded to the actual delivery units at Canadian military bases and ships abroad. In this example, Canada Post will deliver to the CFPO at Belleville and the Canadian Forces Postal System will continue transport to the addressee at CFPO 5053 (in Geilenkirchen, Germany) by whatever means and timing the military will deem appropriate.  Alternative uses  Postal codes can be correlated with databased information from censuses or health registries to create a geographic profile of an area's population. For instance, postal codes have been used to compare children's risk of developing cancer and to describe a neighbourhood's entrenched poverty (\\"Vancouver's Downtown Eastside is Canada's poorest postal code\\").The street value of prescription drugs, Amin Sajan, MD; Trevor Corneil, MD; Stefan Grzybowski, MD, MClSc, CMAJ 1998;159:139-42 As Canadian electoral districts frequently follow postal code areas, citizens can identify their local elected representative using their postal code. Provincial and federal government websites offer an online \\"look-up\\" feature based on postal codes. Although A1A 1A1 is sometimes displayed as a generic code for this purpose, it is actually a genuine postal code in use in the Lower Battery, St. John's Harbour, Newfoundland. Another common \\"example\\" code in Canada Post materials, K1A 0B1, is the valid code for the Canada Post headquarters building in Ottawa.

Released in March 1969, it was their first record with Doug Yule, who was a replacement for John Cale. Recorded in 1968 at TTG Studios in Hollywood, California, the album's sound‚Äîconsisting largely of ballads and straightforward rock songs‚Äîmarked a notable shift in style from the band's previous recordings. In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked The Velvet Underground at number 314 in its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Background Lou Reed, the band's principal songwriter, said of the album: \\"I really didn't think we should make another White Light/White Heat. I thought it would be a terrible mistake, and I really believed that. I thought we had to demonstrate the other side of us. Otherwise, we would become this one-dimensional thing, and that had to be avoided at all costs.\\" Drummer Moe Tucker said, \\"I was pleased with the direction we were going and with the new calmness in the group, and thinking about a good future, hoping people would smarten up and some record company would take us on and do us justice.\\" Doug Yule said the album \\"was a lot of fun. The sessions were constructive and happy and creative, everybody was working together.\\" The Velvet Underground was the band's first album for MGM Records, its first two albums having been issued on Verve, an MGM subsidiary. The previously strong Andy Warhol influence is diminished, with the most notable ties to the Factory being the cover and back photographs taken by Warholite Billy Name, and the opening track \\"Candy Says\\" about Warhol superstar Candy Darling (who reappears in Reed's 1972 song \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\"). The song was sung by Yule at Reed's insistence. The LP sleeve was designed by Dick Smith, then a staff artist at MGM/Verve, with Billy Name's photo of the band sitting sedately on a couch at Andy Warhol's Factory. \\"The Murder Mystery\\" included all four band members' voices. During the verses, Lou Reed and guitarist Sterling Morrison recite different verses of poetry simultaneously, with the voices positioned strictly to the left and right. For the choruses, Maureen Tucker and Doug Yule sing different lyrics and melodies at the same time, also separated left and right. The album's closing song, \\"After Hours\\", has a rare solo lead vocal by Moe Tucker, again requested by Reed as he felt the sweet, innocent quality of her voice fit the song's mood better than his own. The album was produced by the band themselves, and issued in two different stereo mixes. The more widely distributed mix is the one done by MGM/Verve staff engineer Val Valentin. The other mix was done by Lou Reed, boosting his vocals and guitar solos, while reducing the level of other instruments. This version was dubbed the \\"Closet Mix\\" by Sterling Morrison, because it sounded to him as if it had been recorded in a closet. The most dramatic difference is that the two versions use entirely different performances of \\"Some Kinda Love\\", both taken from the same recording sessions. Music and lyrics The restraint and subtlety of the album was a significant departure from the direct abrasiveness of White Light/White Heat. Music critic Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune characterized it as folk rock, and Rolling Stone magazine's Troy Carpenter said that it focused on mellow, melodic rock. According to music journalist Steve Taylor, The Velvet Underground is a pop album because of its more accessible songs and \\"has been called Lou Reed with a backing band due to the emphasis placed on songs rather than experimental sound work.\\" Apart from the forceful rockers \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Beginning to See the Light\\", the album contains reflective, melodic songs that are about various forms of love, such as \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\", \\"Some Kinda Love\\", \\"Jesus\\", \\"I'm Set Free\\" and \\"That's the Story of My Life\\". Reed and Morrison's twin-guitar playing became the band's most prominent sound, and the album had spare arrangements that lacked distortion. The only song that exhibited the band's avant-garde roots is \\"The Murder Mystery\\", which incorporated a raga rhythm, murmuring organ, overlapping spoken-word passages, and lilting counterpoint vocals. Release and reception The Velvet Underground was released in 1969 and did not impact the Billboard 200 until 1985, when it reached No. 197. According to Billboard in 2013, it had sold 201,000 copies since 1991, when Nielsen SoundScan began tracking record sales. Reviewing the album for The Village Voice in 1969, Robert Christgau viewed it as the band's best work and found it tuneful, well written, and exceptionally sung, despite \\"another bummer experiment\\" in \\"The Murder Mystery\\" which he referred to as \\"some questionable stereo recording.\\" Lester Bangs, writing in Rolling Stone magazine, felt that it is not on-par with White Light/White Heat and has missteps with \\"The Murder Mystery\\" and \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\", but ultimately said that its combination of powerfully expressive music and profoundly sentimental lyrics will persuade the band's detractors into believing they can \\"write and play any kind of music they want to with equal brilliance.\\" In his ballot for Jazz & Pop magazine's annual critics poll, Christgau ranked it as the sixth best album of the year. He later included it in his \\"Basic Record Library\\" of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). In a review of the album's 1985 reissue, Rolling Stones David Fricke remarked that both The Velvet Underground and its predecessor lack the diverse range of the band's 1967 debut album and the precise accessibility of Loaded (1970). However, he felt that the album is still edifying as a tender, subtly broad song cycle whose stark production surprisingly reveals the essence of Reed's more expressive songwriting. Fricke cited the \\"ironic pairing\\" of \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" and \\"Jesus\\" as the best summary of \\"the hopeful warmth at the center of the Velvets' rage.\\" Colin Larkin, writing in The Encyclopedia of Popular Music (1998), said that the album showcased a new subtlety because of Reed's larger role in the band and that it \\"unveiled a pastoral approach, gentler and more subdued, retaining the chilling, disquieting aura of previous releases.\\" The Velvet Underground was voted number 262 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000). In 2003, The Velvet Underground was ranked number 314 by Rolling Stone on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The 2012 edition saw it moved 316th. NME magazine named it the 21st best album of all time in a similar list. In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Rob Sheffield wrote that after Cale's departure, the band became \\"acoustic folkie balladeers\\" and that Reed was unexpectedly charming on the album, whose \\"every song is a classic\\". Q magazine called the album \\"a flickering, unforgettable band performance\\". Sputnikmusic's Nick Butler felt that, although it is not as good as the band's debut album, The Velvet Underground is \\"still a brilliant album.\\" Track listing All tracks written by Lou Reed, except where noted.

Sausalito Journal; Whole Earth State-of-Art Rapping Whole Earth had a special role in promoting alternative technology or appropriate technology. In deciding to publish full-length articles on specific topics in natural sciences, invention, arts, etc., Whole Earth (like its predecessor, CoEvolution Quarterly) was a journal aimed primarily at the educated layperson. The industrial designer and educator J. Baldwin served as the technology editor. Tool and book reviews were in abundance, and ecological and technology topics were interspersed with articles treating social and community subjects. One of the journal's recurring themes was ‚Äúthe commons‚Äù (a thing, institution or geographic space of, or having to do with, the community as a whole), and the related ‚Äútragedy of the commons‚Äù.Whole Earth Review (1985-2003) issues #44-110.

He founded a number of organizations, including The WELL, the Global Business Network, and the Long Now Foundation. He is the author of several books, most recently Whole Earth Discipline: An Ecopragmatist Manifesto.  Life  Brand was born in Rockford, Illinois and attended Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire. He studied biology at Stanford University, graduating in 1960. As a soldier in the U.S. Army, he was a parachutist and taught infantry skills; he later expressed the view that his experience in the military had fostered his competence in organizing. A civilian again in 1962, he studied design at San Francisco Art Institute, photography at San Francisco State College, and participated in a legitimate scientific study of then-legal LSD, in Menlo Park, California. In 1966, he married mathematician Lois Jennings, an Ottawa Native American.Brand 2009, p. 236 Brand has lived in California since the 1960s. He and his second wife live on Mirene, a -long working tugboat. Built in 1912, the boat is moored in a former shipyard in Sausalito, California. He works in Mary Heartline, a grounded fishing boat about 100 yards (90 metres) away. One of his favorite items is a table on which Otis Redding is said to have written \\"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\\". (Brand acquired it from an antiques dealer in Sausalito.) Merry Pranksters By the mid-1960s, Brand became associated with author Ken Kesey and the \\"Merry Pranksters\\". With his partner Ram√≥n Sender Baray√≥n, he produced the Trips Festival in San Francisco, an early effort involving rock music and light shows. This was one of the first venues at which the Grateful Dead performed in San Francisco. About 10,000 hippies attended, and Haight-Ashbury soon emerged as a community. Tom Wolfe describes Brand in his 1968 book, The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.Wolfe, T., The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1968), pp. 363 ff. NASA images of Earth Earth from space, by ATS-3 satellite, 1967. Earthrise, by William Anders, Apollo 8, 1968. In 1966, while on an LSD trip on the roof of his house in North Beach, San Francisco, Brand became convinced that seeing an image of the whole Earth would change how we think about the planet and ourselves. He then campaigned to have NASA release the then-rumored satellite image of the entire Earth as seen from space. He sold and distributed buttons for 25 cents each asking, \\"Why haven't we seen a photograph of the whole Earth yet?\\".Brand 2009, p. 214 During this campaign, Brand met Richard Buckminster Fuller, who offered to help Brand with his projects. In 1967, a satellite, ATS-3, took the photo. Brand thought the image of our planet would be a powerful symbol. It adorned the first (Fall 1968) edition of the Whole Earth Catalog.The front cover of the Fall 1968 edition of the Whole Earth Catalog showing the AST-3 image of 10 November 1967 Later in 1968, NASA astronaut Bill Anders took an Earth photo, Earthrise, from Moon orbit, which became the front image of the spring 1969 edition of the Catalog. 1970 saw the first celebration of Earth Day. During a 2003 interview, Brand explained that the image \\"gave the sense that Earth's an island, surrounded by a lot of inhospitable space. And it's so graphic, this little blue, white, green and brown jewel-like icon amongst a quite featureless black vacuum.\\" Douglas Engelbart In late 1968, Brand assisted electrical engineer Douglas Engelbart with The Mother of All Demos, a famous presentation of many revolutionary computer technologies (including hypertext, email, and the mouse) to the Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco. Brand surmised that given the necessary consciousness, information, and tools, human beings could reshape the world they had made (and were making) for themselves into something environmentally and socially sustainable. Whole Earth Catalog During the late 1960s and early 1970s about 10 million Americans were involved in living communally. In 1968, using the most basic approaches to typesetting and page-layout, Brand and his colleagues created issue number one of The Whole Earth Catalog, employing the significant subtitle, \\"access to tools\\". Brand and his wife Lois travelled to communes in a 1963 Dodge truck known as the Whole Earth Truck Store, which moved to a storefront in Menlo Park, California. That first oversize Catalog, and its successors in the 1970s and later, reckoned a wide assortment of things could serve as useful \\"tools\\": books, maps, garden implements, specialized clothing, carpenters' and masons' tools, forestry gear, tents, welding equipment, professional journals, early synthesizers, and personal computers. Brand invited \\"reviews\\" (written in the form of a letter to a friend) of the best of these items from experts in specific fields. The information also described where these things could be located or purchased. The Catalogs publication coincided with the great wave of social and cultural experimentation, convention-breaking, and \\"do it yourself\\" attitude associated with the \\"counterculture\\". The influence of these Whole Earth Catalogs on the rural back-to-the-land movement of the 1970s, and the communities movement within many cities, was widespread throughout the United States, Canada, and Australia. A 1972 edition sold 1.5 million copies, winning the first U.S. National Book Award in category Contemporary Affairs. \\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1972\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-09. There was a \\"Contemporary\\" or \\"Current\\" award category from 1972 to 1980. CoEvolution Quarterly To continue this work and also to publish full- length articles on specific topics in the natural sciences and invention, in numerous areas of the arts and the social sciences, and on the contemporary scene in general, Brand founded the CoEvolution Quarterly (CQ) during 1974, aimed primarily at educated laypersons. Brand never better revealed his opinions and reason for hope than when he ran, in CoEvolution Quarterly #4, a transcription of technology historian Lewis Mumford's talk \\"The Next Transformation of Man\\", in which he stated that \\"man has still within him sufficient resources to alter the direction of modern civilization, for we then need no longer regard man as the passive victim of his own irreversible technological development.\\" The content of CoEvolution Quarterly often included futurism or risqu√© topics. Besides giving space to unknown writers with something valuable to say, Brand presented articles by many respected authors and thinkers, including Lewis Mumford, Howard T. Odum, Witold Rybczynski, Karl Hess, Orville Schell, Ivan Illich, Wendell Berry, Ursula K. Le Guin, Gregory Bateson, Amory Lovins, Hazel Henderson, Gary Snyder, Lynn Margulis, Eric Drexler, Gerard K. O'Neill, Peter Calthorpe, Sim Van der Ryn, Paul Hawken, John Todd, Kevin Kelly, and Donella Meadows. During ensuing years, Brand authored and edited a number of books on topics as diverse as computer-based media, the life history of buildings, and ideas about space colonies. He founded the Whole Earth Software Review, a supplement to the Whole Earth Software Catalog, in 1984. It merged with CoEvolution Quarterly to form the Whole Earth Review in 1985. California government From 1977 to 1979, Brand served as \\"special adviser\\" to the administration of California Governor Jerry Brown. The WELL In 1985, Brand and Larry Brilliant founded The WELL (\\"Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link\\"), a prototypical, wide-ranging online community for intelligent, informed participants the world over. The WELL won the 1990 Best Online Publication Award from the Computer Press Association.Katie Hafner, The WELL: A Story of Love, Death and Real Life in the Seminal Online Community:(2001) Carroll & Graf Publishers Almost certainly the ideas behind the WELL were greatly inspired by Douglas Engelbart's work at SRI International; Brand was acknowledged by Engelbart in \\"The Mother of All Demos\\" in 1968 when the computer mouse and video conferencing were introduced.  All Species Foundation In 2000, Brand helped to launch the All Species Foundation, which aimed to catalog all species of life on Earth until its closure in 2007. Global Business Network Sausalito, California, in 2009. During 1986, Brand was a visiting scientist at the MIT Media Lab. Soon after, he became a private-conference organizer for such corporations as Royal Dutch/Shell, Volvo, and AT&T; Corporation. In 1988, he became a co‚Äëfounder of the Global Business Network, which explores global futures and business strategies informed by the sorts of values and information which Brand has always found vital. The GBN has become involved with the evolution and application of scenario thinking, planning, and complementary strategic tools. For fourteen years, Brand was on the board of the Santa Fe Institute (founded in 1984), an organization devoted to \\"fostering a multidisciplinary scientific research community pursuing frontier science.\\" He has also continued to promote the preservation of tracts of wilderness. Whole Earth Discipline The Whole Earth Catalog implied an ideal of human progress that depended on decentralized, personal, and liberating technological development‚Äîso‚Äëcalled \\"soft technology\\". However, during 2005 he criticized aspects of the international environmental ideology he had helped to develop. He wrote an article called \\"Environmental Heresies\\" in the May 2005 issue of the MIT Technology Review, in which he describes what he considers necessary changes to environmentalism. He suggested among other things that environmentalists embrace nuclear power and genetically modified organisms as technologies with more promise than risk. Brand later developed these ideas into a book and published the Whole Earth Discipline: An Ecopragmatist Manifesto in 2009. The book examines how urbanization, nuclear power, genetic engineering, geoengineering, and wildlife restoration can be used as powerful tools in humanity's ongoing fight against global warming. In a 2019 interview, Brand described his perspective as \\"post-libertarian\\", indicating that at the time when the Whole Earth Catalog was being written, he did not fully understand the significance of the role of government in the development of technology and engineering. The Long Now Foundation Brand is co‚Äëchair and President of the Board of Directors of The Long Now Foundation. Brand chairs the foundation's Seminars About Long-term Thinking (SALT). This series on long-term thinking has presented a large range of different speakers including: Brian Eno, Neal Stephenson, Vernor Vinge, Philip Rosedale, Jimmy Wales, Kevin Kelly, Clay Shirky, Ray Kurzweil, Bruce Sterling, Cory Doctorow, and many others.

First published in the 19th century, it is still in current use. History It was first published in 1814 in Manchester. Gadsby published a later edition in 1838.Preface to William Gadsby's last edition, November 1838 After his death a further enlarged edition was published including a second supplement selected by J C Philpot, another Strict Baptist Minister.Preface to Second Supplement It was written to counteract what Gadsby believed to be Arminian and legalistic tendencies in Isaac Watts' Psalms and Hymns. Contents This hymnal contains 1156 hymns (words only) by various authors. These are primarily, but not exclusively, from the Calvinistic stream of Protestant thought. =Authors= The edition currently available includes the following authors, here listed by number of hymns used. Joseph Hart (219); William Gadsby (173); Isaac Watts (145) John Berridge (72); John Newton (63) John Kent (51); Charles Wesley (41); Thomas Kelly (34); Samuel Medley (31); Anne Steele (27); Augustus M. Toplady (24); Richard Burnham (22); Henry Fowler (20); William Cowper (18); Joseph Swain (18); Daniel Herbert (12); Benjamin Beddome (10); John Fawcett (10); William Hammond (10); John Stevens (9); John Adams (9); Phillip Doddridge (8); John Cennick (6). There are other authors with fewer hymns in this book, as well as eight anonymous contributions. =Examples of Gadsby's own writing= Gadsby's own hymns are of a high standard. For example, number 667 is worthy of Watts and Wesley, both highly regarded for their hymn writing abilities. 1 IMMORTAL honours rest on Jesus' head; My God, my Portion, and my Living Bread; In him I live, upon him cast my care; He saves from death, destruction, and despair. 2 He is my Refuge in each deep distress; The Lord my strength & glorious righteousness; Through floods and flames he leads me safely on, And daily makes his sovereign goodness known. 3 My every need he richly will supply; Nor will his mercy ever let me die; In him there dwells a treasure all divine, And matchless grace has made that treasure mine. 4 O that my soul could love and praise him more, His beauties trace, his majesty adore; Live near his heart, upon his bosom lean; Obey his voice, and all his will esteem. The third line of the last verse certainly echoes the thought of Charles Wesley's hymn Thou Shepherd of Israel, and mine, with the line \\"Eternally held in Thy heart\\". Another example from William Gadsby illustrates the Calvinistic flavour of this book. Hymn number 530 describes election in Calvinistic language. 1 ELECTION is a truth divine, As absolute as free; Works ne'er can make the blessing mine; 'Tis God's own wise decree. 5 Nor law, nor death, nor hell, nor sin, Can alter his decree; The elect eternal life shall win, And all God's glory see. Availability The hymnal is currently available in these editions : \\"Buckram\\" (standard pew edition), 936p., ; Large print version, 636p., ; Large print (leather), 936p., ,;Gospel Standard Trust Publications (web site accessed 7 December 2008) leather binding and India paper, 895 pp.; hardback, 895 pp.; and a Kivar edition, 473 pp. The hymn book is used by the Gospel Standard Strict Baptists in England and the United States and a few Old School or Primitive Baptist churches in the United States. Many of the Strict Baptists use the Companion Tune Book, a musical score of 1011 hymn tunes designed as a companion to Gadsby's hymn book. The hymn book was never widely used in churches outside the United Kingdom, but there is some renewed interest in it among Reformed Baptists as devotional poetry. Gadsby also published Nazarene's Songs, containing about 250 of his own hymns.

Merriam-Webster Dictionary or , , Quebec French: ) is a type of very thin pancake. Cr√™pes are usually of two types: sweet cr√™pes (cr√™pes sucr√©es) and savoury galettes (cr√™pes sal√©es). Cr√™pes are served with a variety of fillings, from the simplest with only sugar to flamb√©ed cr√™pes Suzette or elaborate savoury galettes. Cr√™pes orignate in Brittany, a region in the northwest of France, the consumption is widespread in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Canada, and many parts of Europe, North Africa, North America, Lebanon, Brazil and Argentina. Etymology Cr√™pes belong to the general category of ancient Greek Tiganitai, from Greek tiganos (œÑŒØŒ≥Œ±ŒΩŒøœÇ), meaning \\"frying pan\\", which, in English, is literally translated to Pancakes.[Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae, XIV, 645c; Galen, On the Properties of Foods, I, 3] The French term \\"cr√™pe\\" derives from the Latin crispa, meaning with \\"creases\\". The name \\"galette\\" came from the French word galet (\\"pebble\\") since the first galettes were made on a large pebble heated in a fire. Traditions In France and Belgium, cr√™pes are traditionally served on Candlemas (La Chandeleur), February 2. This day was originally Virgin Mary's Blessing Day but became known in France as \\"Le Jour des Cr√™pes\\" (literally translated \\"The Day of the Cr√™pes\\", and sometimes called colloquially as \\"Avec Cr√™pe Day\\", \\"National Cr√™pe Day\\", or \\"day of the Cr√™pe\\"), referring to the tradition of offering cr√™pes. In fact, in 472 Pope Gelasio, I offered Cr√™pes to French pilgrims that were visiting Rome for celebrating the Chandeleur.https://france-amerique.com/en/la-chandeleur-the-day-to-flip- crepes/ Also, the belief is that catching the cr√™pe with a frying pan after tossing it in the air with your right hand while holding a gold coin in your left hand would cause you to become rich that year. Redmond, Barbara (30 January 2012). La Chandeleur ‚Äì Le Jour des Cr√™pes. Retrieved on 28 February 2012 from http://awomansparis.wordpress.com/2012/01/30/la-chandeleur-le-jour- des-crepes/. The roundness and golden color of a cr√™pe resemble the sun and its rays. This symbolism also applies to the coin held in the person's hand.Sokolov, Raymond. \\"Sun food.\\" Natural History May 1993: 82. Academic Search Complete.  Types of cr√™pe  Sweet cr√™pes are generally made with wheat flour (farine de froment). When sweet, they can be eaten as part of breakfast or as a dessert. Common fillings include Nutella spread, preserves, sugar (granulated or powdered), maple syrup, golden syrup, lemon juice, whipped cream, fruit spreads, custard, and sliced soft fruits or confiture. Savory cr√™pes are made with non-wheat flours such as buckwheat. A normal savory cr√™pe recipe includes using wheat flour but omitting the sugar. Batter made from buckwheat flour is gluten-free, which makes it possible for people who have a gluten allergy or intolerance to eat this type of cr√™pe. Common savoury fillings for cr√™pes served for lunch or dinner are cheese, ham, and eggs, ratatouille, mushrooms, artichoke (in certain regions), and various meat products. Cr√™pes can also be made into crepe cakes. By adding the plain crepes on top of each other and within the two layers adds one layer of cream. It can also add anything you like, such as fruits, chocolate, cookies, marshmallow, and etcetera. Most of the cr√™pe cake is sweet and people usually consider it as a dessert. It can also replace the traditional birthday cake that people usually buy. Cr√™pe cakes are usually 15-30 layers, and the cr√™pes used are very thin and soft. Batters can also consist of other simple ingredients such as butter, milk, water, eggs, flour, salt, and sugar.\\"Wrap it up in a cr√™pe; Thin pancakes work in savory or sweet dishes.\\" Times-Colonist (Victoria, British Columbia). (24 April 2013 Wednesday) LexisNexis Academic. Fillings are commonly added to the center of the cr√™pe and served with the edges partially folded over the center. An Indian variety of the cr√™pe uses a multi-grain flour called \\"bhajanee\\", eggs, curd, and an assortment of spices as its ingredients. It is a modern variation of an Indian dish called Thalipeeth. Making batter In order to make an evenly thin cr√™pe, it is crucial to have a batter without lumps, which is difficult. After whisking the batter, it is best to let it rest for half an hour, or even overnight, to let the bubbles from whisking disappear from the batter. Some people even mix the batter to a fine consistency by using a blender or mixer. Also, a good machine will be a shortcut to making a better cr√™pe. Cr√™peries A small cr√™perie Cr√™perie in Germany A cr√™perie may be a takeaway restaurant or stall, serving cr√™pes as a form of fast food or street food, or may be a more formal sit-down restaurant or caf√©. Cr√™peries are typical in France, especially in Brittany; however, cr√™peries can be found throughout France and in many other countries. Because a cr√™pe may be served as either a main meal or a dessert, cr√™peries may be quite diverse in their selection and may offer other baked goods such as baguettes. They may also serve coffee, tea, buttermilk, and cider (a popular drink to accompany cr√™pes). Special cr√™pes Mille cr√™pes Mille cr√™pes(ja) are a French cake made of many cr√™pe layers. The word mille means \\"a thousand\\", implying the many layers of cr√™pe. Another standard French and Belgian cr√™pe is the cr√™pe Suzette, a cr√™pe with lightly grated orange peel and liqueur (usually Grand Marnier), which is subsequently lit upon presentation.Courtine, Robert J. (1984), Larousse gastronomique (French edition), Paris: Librairie Larousse. English pancakes are similar to wheat flour cr√™pes and are served with golden syrup or lemon juice and sugar. Swedish pancakes, also called Nordic pancakes, are similar to French cr√™pes. In some of the Nordic countries, cr√™pes are served with jam or fruit, especially lingonberries (or the butter from that fruit) as a dessert with a variety of savory fillings. Traditional Swedish variations can be exotic. Besides the usual thin pancakes, called pannkakor in Swedish and r√§isk√§le in Finnish which resemble the French cr√™pes and, often served with whipped cream and jam, are traditionally eaten for lunch on Thursdays with pea soup. The Swedish cuisine (as well as the Finnish one) has pl√§ttar/lettu, which resemble tiny English pancakes, are fried several at a time in a special pan. Others resemble German pancakes but are baked in the oven and include fried pork in the batter (fl√§skpannkaka). Potato pancakes called \\"raggmunk\\" contain shredded raw potato and may contain other vegetables (sometimes the pancake batter is omitted, producing r√•rakor). A special Swedish pancake is the saffron pancake from Gotland which is made with saffron and rice and baked in the oven. It is common to add lemon juice to the sugar for extra taste. The pancakes are often served after a soup. Another special Swedish pancake is the √§ggakaka (eggcake), also called sk√•nsk √§ggakaka (Scanian eggcake). It is almost like an ordinary Swedish pancake but it is much thicker and more difficult to make due to the risk of burning it. It is made in a frying pan and is about to 2 inches thick and is served with lingonberries and bacon. The Norwegian variety is commonly eaten for dinner, traditionally with bacon, jam (typically bilberry jam) or sugar. A plate of 49er flapjacks The 49er flapjack is a sourdough cr√™pe which is popular in the United States, getting its name from the popularity of this style of pancake during the California Gold Rush. Because it is similar to a Swedish pancake, the 49er is sometimes served with lingonberry sauce, although most often it is rolled up with butter and powdered sugar, or served open-faced and topped with maple syrup. Cherry Kijafa Cr√™pes are also common in the United States and are made with a traditional cr√™pe base, but filled with cherries simmered in a Kijafa wine sauce.Pancake House (2007). \\"Cherry Kijafa Crepes\\"; retrieved from http://www.originalpancakehouse.com/phm_crepes2.html. Cr√™pe dentelle is a crispy biscuit made with a very thin layer of cr√™pe folded in a cigar shape and then baked. It is usually enjoyed with a hot drink during the go√ªter, in France. Cr√™pes in European culture A sweet cr√™pe filled with oats, berries, and topped with whipped cream. Frixuelos. This is a kind of cr√™pe made in Asturias, Spain. In Norwegian, cr√™pes are called pannekake, in most German regions Cr√™pes (referring to a wide and flat cr√™pe, as opposed to the smaller and thicker native Pfannkuchen pancakes). In Swedish, a cr√™pe is called pannkaka in southern regions while being called pl√§ttar in the north, in Danish, pandekager (\\"pancakes\\"), in Icelandic it is called p√∂nnukaka, in Finnish a cr√™pe is called either ohukainen or lettu or r√§isk√§le, in Greek it is krepa (ŒöœÅŒ≠œÄŒ±), in Dutch it is a pannenkoek or flensje, and in Afrikaans a pannekoek, which is usually served with cinnamon and sugar. In the Spanish regions of Galicia and Asturias, they are traditionally served at carnivals. In Galicia, they're called filloas, and may also be made with pork blood instead of milk. In Asturias, they are called fayueles or frixuelos, and in Turkey, akƒ±tma. In areas of central Europe, formerly belonging to the Austro- Hungarian empire, there is a thin pancake comparable to a cr√™pe that in Austro-Bavarian is called Palatschinken; in ; and in Bulgarian, Macedonian, Czech, Serbo-Croatian, and ; in . In the Balkan countries, palaƒçinka or palla√ßinka may be eaten with fruit jam, quark cheese, sugar, honey, or the hazelnut-chocolate cream Nutella, while there is also a breaded variant which is mostly filled with meat. Restaurants which are specialised in palaƒçinci are called \\"Palaƒçinkara\\" in the region. In Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, there is a similar dish known as the blintz. The Oxford English Dictionary derives the German and Slavic words from the Hungarians palacsinta, which it derives from the Romanian plƒÉcintƒÉ, which comes in turn from classical Latin placenta (\\"small flat cake\\"), even though the Romanian plƒÉcintƒÉ is more similar to a pie, and the cr√™pes are actually called clƒÉtitƒÉ. During the Russian celebration of Maslenitsa (Russian Butter Week), one of the most popular foods are blini, or cr√™pes. Since they are made from butter, eggs, and milk, cr√™pes are allowed to be consumed during the celebration by the Orthodox church. There are endless combinations of the recipes and the execution of cr√™pes. White flour can be replaced with buckwheat flour and milk can be switched for kefir. Furthermore, different oils can be added or substituted. Blini are served stocked with a piece of butter and topped with caviar, cheese, meat, potatoes, mushrooms, honey, berry jam, or often a dollop of sour cream. The dish is supposed to represent the sun since the holiday is about the beginning of the spring. In addition to cr√™peries and cr√™pe franchises, some cr√™pe manufacturers use modern equipment to produce cr√™pes in bulk. Chocolate- Coconut Cr√™pe served in cr√™perie near the Pantheon in Paris, France The names for thin cr√™pes in other parts of Europe are: Cr√™pes outside of Europe Dishes with similar appearance, taste, and preparation methods exist in other parts of the world as well. In South India, a cr√™pe made of fermented rice batter is called a dosa, which often has savory fillings. In Western India, a cr√™pe made of gram flour is called \\"Pudlaa\\" or \\"Poodla\\", with the batter consisting of vegetables and spices. Another variety is called \\"patibola\\" and is sweet in taste due to milk, jaggery, or sugar. The injera of Ethiopian/Eritrean/Somali/Yemeni cuisine is often described as a thick cr√™pe. In Somalia, Malawa·∏• (Somali: Malawax) is very similar to a cr√™pe. It is mostly eaten at breakfast. Cr√™pes have also long been popular in Japan and Malaysia, with sweet and savory varieties being sold at many small stands, usually called cr√™peries. In Argentina and Uruguay, they are called panqueques and are often eaten with dulce de leche. Various other French foods such as cr√™pes, souffl√©s, and quiche have slowly made their way into North American cooking establishments.Benenson, R. (1984). Dining in America. Editorial research reports 1984 (Vol. I). Washington, DC: CQ Press. Typically, these franchises stick to the traditional French method of making cr√™pes but they have also put their own spin on the cr√™pe with new types such as the hamburger and pizza cr√™pe. In Mexico, cr√™pes are known as crepas, and were introduced during the 19th century by the FrenchFern√°ndez-del-Villar, Miguel Angel and Ruiz-Naufal, V√≠ctor M., Mesa Mexicana (1993), Fundaci√≥n Cultural Bancomer, and are typically served either as a sweet dessert when filled with cajeta (similar to dulce de leche), or as a savoury dish when filled with Huitlacoche (corn smut), which is considered a delicacy. In the Philippines, a unique native cr√™pe recipe is the daral which is made from ground glutinous rice and coconut milk batter (galapong). It is rolled into a cylinder and filled with sweetened coconut meat strips (hinti). See also References : 19.

As chief engineer of London's Metropolitan Board of Works his major achievement was the creation (in response to the Great Stink of 1858) of a sewer network for central London which was instrumental in relieving the city from cholera epidemics, while beginning to clean the River Thames. Early life Bazalgette was born in Hill Lodge, Clay Hill, Enfield, London, the son of Joseph William Bazalgette (1783‚Äì1849), a retired Royal Navy captain, and Theresa Philo, born Pilton (1796‚Äì1850), and was the grandson of a French Protestant immigrant who had become wealthy.Tailor Louis Bazalgette's account for the Prince Regent since the 1770s was guaranteed by Parliament and when paid after he succeeded as king George IV of the United Kingdom was worth in modern terms (2014) about two million pounds: BBC Radio 4, at https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/b04hvy0l In 1827 when Joseph was eight years old, the family moved into a newly-built house in Hamilton Terrace, St. John's Wood, London. He spent his early career articled to the noted engineer Sir John Macneill working on railway projects and amassed sufficient experience (partly in China and Ireland) in land drainage and reclamation to enable him to set up his own London consulting practice in 1842. In 1845 the house in Hamilton Terrace was sold and Joseph, who was then 28, married Maria Kough, from County Kilkenny, in Ireland. At the time he was working so hard on the expansion of the railway network that two years later, in 1847, he suffered a nervous breakdown. While he was recovering, London's Metropolitan Commission of Sewers ordered that all cesspits should be closed and that house drains should connect to sewers and empty into the Thames. As a result, a cholera epidemic (1848‚Äì49) killed 14,137 Londoners. Bazalgette was appointed assistant surveyor to the Commission in 1849, taking over as Engineer in 1852, after his predecessor died of \\"harassing fatigues and anxieties.\\" Soon after, another cholera epidemic struck, in 1853, killing 10,738. Medical opinion at the time held that cholera was caused by foul air: a so-called miasma. Physician Dr John Snow had earlier advanced a different explanation, which is now known to be correct: cholera was spread by contaminated water. His view was not then generally accepted. Championed by fellow engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Bazalgette was appointed chief engineer of the Commission's successor, the Metropolitan Board of Works, in 1856 (a post which he retained until the MBW was abolished and replaced by the London County Council in 1889). In 1858, the year of the Great Stink, Parliament passed an enabling act, in spite of the colossal expense of the project, and Bazalgette's proposals to revolutionise London's sewerage system began to be implemented. The expectation was that enclosed sewers would eliminate the stink ('miasma'), and that this would then reduce the incidence of cholera. Sewer works The old Abbey Mills Pumping Station Interior of the Octagon at Crossness Pumping Station showing its elaborate decorative ironwork Drainage reports by Bazalgette in the Institution of Civil Engineers' archives At that time, the River Thames was little more than an open sewer, empty of any fish or other wildlife, and an obvious health hazard to Londoners. Bazalgette's solution (similar to a proposal made by painter John Martin 25 years earlier) was to construct a network of of enclosed underground brick main sewers to intercept sewage outflows, and of street sewers, to intercept the raw sewage which up until then flowed freely through the streets and thoroughfares of London. The plan included major pumping stations at Deptford (1864) and at Crossness (1865) on the Erith marshes, both on the south side of the Thames, and at Abbey Mills (in the River Lea valley, 1868) and on the Chelsea Embankment (close to Grosvenor Bridge; 1875), north of the river. The outflows were diverted downstream where they were collected in two large sewage outfall systems on the north and south sides of the Thames called the Northern and Southern Outfall sewers. The sewage from the Northern Outfall sewer and that from the Southern Outfall were originally collected in balancing tanks in Beckton and Crossness, respectively, before being dumped, untreated, into the Thames at high tide. The system was opened by Edward, Prince of Wales in 1865, although the whole project was not actually completed for another ten years. Partly as a result of the Princess Alice disaster, extensive sewage treatment facilities were built to replace the balancing tanks in Beckton and Crossness in 1900. Bazalgette's foresight may be seen in the diameter of the sewers. When planning the network he took the densest population, gave every person the most generous allowance of sewage production and came up with a diameter of pipe needed. He then said 'Well, we're only going to do this once and there's always the unforeseen' and doubled the diameter to be used. His foresight allowed for the unforeseen increase in population density with the introduction of the tower block; with the original, smaller pipe diameter the sewer would have overflowed in the 1960s, rather than coping until the present day as it has. The unintended consequence of the new sewer system was to eliminate cholera everywhere in the water system, whether or not it stank. The basic premise of this expensive project, that miasma spread cholera infection, was wrong. However, instead of causing the project to fail, the new sewers succeeded in virtually eliminating the disease by removing the contamination. Bazalgette's sewers also decreased the incidence of typhus and typhoid epidemics. Bazalgette's capacity for hard work was remarkable; every connection to the sewerage system by the various Vestry Councils had to be checked and Bazalgette did this himself and the records contain thousands of linen plans with handwritten comments in Indian ink on them \\"Approved JWB\\", \\"I do not like 6\\" used here and 9\\" should be used. JWB\\", and so on. It is perhaps not surprising that his health suffered as a result. The records are held by Thames Water in large blue binders gold-blocked reading \\"Metropolitan Board of Works\\" and then dated, usually two per year. Private life Bazalgette lived at 17 Hamilton Terrace, St John's Wood, north London, for some years. Before 1851, he moved to Morden, then in 1873 to Arthur Road, Wimbledon, where he died in 1891, and he was buried in the nearby churchyard at St Mary's Church. In 1845 at Westminster, he married Maria Kough (1819‚Äì1902). Lady Bazalgette died at her residence in Wimbledon on 3 March 1902. They had children including: #Joseph William, born 20 February 1846 #Charles Norman born 3 March 1847 #Edward, born 28 June 1848 #Theresa Philo, born 1850 #Caroline, born 17 July 1852 #Maria, born 1854 #Henry, born 14 September 1855 #Willoughby, born 1857 #Maria Louise, born 1859 #Anna Constance, born 3 December 1859 #Evelyn, born 1 April 1861 Awards and memorials Memorial to Sir Joseph Bazalgette on Victoria Embankment Detail of Hammersmith Bridge, designed by Bazalgette Bazalgette was knighted in 1875, and elected President of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1883. A Greater London Council blue plaque commemorates Bazalgette at 17 Hamilton Terrace in St John's Wood in North London, and he is also commemorated by a formal monument on the Victoria Embankment by the River Thames in central London.

For instance, the modal formula \\\\Box P \\\\rightarrow \\\\Diamond P can be read as \\"if P is necessary, then it is also possible\\". This formula is widely regarded as valid when necessity and possibility are understood with respect to knowledge, as in epistemic modal logic. Whether it is also valid with legal or moral necessity (dealt with by deontic logic) is a question debated since Sophocles's play Antigone. The first modal axiomatic systems were developed by C. I. Lewis in 1912, building on an informal tradition stretching back to Aristotle. The relational semantics for modal logic was developed by Arthur Prior, Jaakko Hintikka, and Saul Kripke in the mid twentieth century. In this semantics, formulas are assigned truth values relative to a possible world. A formula's truth value at one possible world can depend on the truth values of other formulas at other accessible possible worlds. In particular, possibility amounts to truth at some accessible possible world while necessity amounts to truth at every accessible possible world. Modal logic is often referred to as \\"the logic of necessity and possibility\\", and such applications continue to play a major role in philosophy of language, epistemology, metaphysics, and formal semantics. However, the mathematical apparatus of modal logic has proved useful in numerous other fields including game theory, program verification, web design, multiverse-based set theory, and social epistemology. One prominent textbook on the model theory of modal logic suggests that it can be seen more generally as the study of formal systems which take a local perspective on relational structures. Semantics =Relational semantics=  Basic notions  The standard semantics for modal logic is called the relational semantics. In this approach, the truth of a formula is determined relative to a point which is often called a possible world. For a formula that contains a modal operator, its truth value can depend on what is true at other accessible worlds. Thus, the relational semantics interprets formulas of modal logic using models defined as follows.Fitting and Mendelsohn. First-Order Modal Logic. Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1998. Section 1.6 * A relational model is a tuple \\\\mathfrak{M} = \\\\langle W, R, V \\\\rangle where: # W is a set of possible worlds # R is a binary relation on W # V is a valuation function which assigns a truth value to each pair of an atomic formula and a world, (i.e. V: W \\\\times F \\\\to \\\\\\\\{ 0,1 \\\\\\\\} where F is the set of atomic formulae) The set W is often called the universe. The binary relation R is called an accessibility relation, and it controls which worlds can \\"see\\" each other for the sake of determining what is true. For example, w R u means that the world u is accessible from world w. That is to say, the state of affairs known as u is a live possibility for w. Finally, the function V is known as a valuation function. It determines which atomic formulas are true at which worlds. Then we recursively define the truth of a formula at a world in a model \\\\mathfrak{M}: * \\\\mathfrak{M}, w \\\\models P iff V(w, P)=1 * \\\\mathfrak{M}, w \\\\models eg P iff w ot \\\\models P * \\\\mathfrak{M}, w \\\\models (P \\\\wedge Q) iff w \\\\models P and w \\\\models Q * \\\\mathfrak{M}, w \\\\models \\\\Box P iff for every element u of W, if w R u then u \\\\models P * \\\\mathfrak{M}, w \\\\models \\\\Diamond P iff for some element u of W, it holds that w R u and u \\\\models P According to this semantics, a formula is necessary with respect to a world w if it holds at every world that is accessible from w. It is possible if it holds at some world that is accessible from w. Possibility thereby depends upon the accessibility relation R, which allows us to express the relative nature of possibility. For example, we might say that given our laws of physics it is not possible for humans to travel faster than the speed of light, but that given other circumstances it could have been possible to do so. Using the accessibility relation we can translate this scenario as follows: At all of the worlds accessible to our own world, it is not the case that humans can travel faster than the speed of light, but at one of these accessible worlds there is another world accessible from those worlds but not accessible from our own at which humans can travel faster than the speed of light.  Frames and completeness The choice of accessibility relation alone can sometimes be sufficient to guarantee the truth or falsity of a formula. For instance, consider a model \\\\mathfrak{M} whose accessibility relation is reflexive. Because the relation is reflexive, we will have that \\\\mathfrak{M},w \\\\models P \\\\rightarrow \\\\Diamond P for any w \\\\in G regardless of which valuation function is used. For this reason, modal logicians sometimes talk about frames, which are the portion of a relational model excluding the valuation function. * A relational frame is a pair \\\\mathfrak{M} = \\\\langle G, R \\\\rangle where G is a set of possible worlds, R is a binary relation on G. The different systems of modal logic are defined using frame conditions. A frame is called: * reflexive if w R w, for every w in G * symmetric if w R u implies u R w, for all w and u in G * transitive if w R u and u R q together imply w R q, for all w, u, q in G. * serial if, for every w in G there is some u in G such that w R u. * Euclidean if, for every u, t, and w, w R u and w R t implies u R t (by symmetry, it also implies t R u) The logics that stem from these frame conditions are: *K := no conditions *D := serial *T := reflexive *B := reflexive and symmetric *S4 := reflexive and transitive *S5 := reflexive and Euclidean The Euclidean property along with reflexivity yields symmetry and transitivity. (The Euclidean property can be obtained, as well, from symmetry and transitivity.) Hence if the accessibility relation R is reflexive and Euclidean, R is provably symmetric and transitive as well. Hence for models of S5, R is an equivalence relation, because R is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. We can prove that these frames produce the same set of valid sentences as do the frames where all worlds can see all other worlds of W (i.e., where R is a \\"total\\" relation). This gives the corresponding modal graph which is total complete (i.e., no more edges (relations) can be added). For example, in any modal logic based on frame conditions: : w \\\\models \\\\Diamond P if and only if for some element u of G, it holds that u \\\\models P and w R u. If we consider frames based on the total relation we can just say that : w \\\\models \\\\Diamond P if and only if for some element u of G, it holds that u \\\\models P. We can drop the accessibility clause from the latter stipulation because in such total frames it is trivially true of all w and u that w R u. But note that this does not have to be the case in all S5 frames, which can still consist of multiple parts that are fully connected among themselves but still disconnected from each other. All of these logical systems can also be defined axiomatically, as is shown in the next section. For example, in S5, the axioms P \\\\implies \\\\Box\\\\Diamond P, \\\\Box P \\\\implies \\\\Box\\\\Box P and \\\\Box P \\\\implies P (corresponding to symmetry, transitivity and reflexivity, respectively) hold, whereas at least one of these axioms does not hold in each of the other, weaker logics. = Topological semantics = Modal logic has also been interpreted using topological structures. For instance, the Interior Semantics interprets formulas of modal logic as follows. A topological model is a tuple \\\\Chi = \\\\langle X, \\\\tau, V \\\\rangle where \\\\langle X, \\\\tau \\\\rangle is a topological space and V is a valuation function which maps each atomic formula to some subset of X. The basic interior semantics interprets formulas of modal logic as follows: * \\\\Chi, x \\\\models P iff x \\\\in V(p) * \\\\Chi, x \\\\models eg \\\\phi iff \\\\Chi, x ot\\\\models \\\\phi * \\\\Chi, x \\\\models \\\\phi \\\\land \\\\chi iff \\\\Chi, x \\\\models \\\\phi and \\\\Chi, x \\\\models \\\\chi * \\\\Chi, x \\\\models \\\\Box \\\\phi iff for some U \\\\in \\\\tau we have both that x \\\\in U and also that \\\\Chi, y \\\\models \\\\phi for all y \\\\in U Topological approaches subsume relational ones, allowing non-normal modal logics. The extra structure they provide also allows a transparent way of modeling certain concepts such as the evidence or justification one has for one's beliefs. Topological semantics is widely used in recent work in formal epistemology and has antecedents in earlier work such as David Lewis and Angelika Kratzer's logics for counterfactuals. Axiomatic systems The first formalizations of modal logic were axiomatic. Numerous variations with very different properties have been proposed since C. I. Lewis began working in the area in 1912. Hughes and Cresswell (1996), for example, describe 42 normal and 25 non-normal modal logics. Zeman (1973) describes some systems Hughes and Cresswell omit. Modern treatments of modal logic begin by augmenting the propositional calculus with two unary operations, one denoting \\"necessity\\" and the other \\"possibility\\". The notation of C. I. Lewis, much employed since, denotes \\"necessarily p\\" by a prefixed \\"box\\" (‚ñ°p) whose scope is established by parentheses. Likewise, a prefixed \\"diamond\\" (‚óáp) denotes \\"possibly p\\". Regardless of notation, each of these operators is definable in terms of the other in classical modal logic: * ‚ñ°p (necessarily p) is equivalent to (\\"not possible that not-p\\") * ‚óáp (possibly p) is equivalent to (\\"not necessarily not-p\\") Hence ‚ñ° and ‚óá form a dual pair of operators. In many modal logics, the necessity and possibility operators satisfy the following analogues of de Morgan's laws from Boolean algebra: :\\"It is not necessary that X\\" is logically equivalent to \\"It is possible that not X\\". :\\"It is not possible that X\\" is logically equivalent to \\"It is necessary that not X\\". Precisely what axioms and rules must be added to the propositional calculus to create a usable system of modal logic is a matter of philosophical opinion, often driven by the theorems one wishes to prove; or, in computer science, it is a matter of what sort of computational or deductive system one wishes to model. Many modal logics, known collectively as normal modal logics, include the following rule and axiom: * N, Necessitation Rule: If p is a theorem (of any system invoking N), then ‚ñ°p is likewise a theorem. * K, Distribution Axiom: The weakest normal modal logic, named \\"K\\" in honor of Saul Kripke, is simply the propositional calculus augmented by ‚ñ°, the rule N, and the axiom K. K is weak in that it fails to determine whether a proposition can be necessary but only contingently necessary. That is, it is not a theorem of K that if ‚ñ°p is true then ‚ñ°‚ñ°p is true, i.e., that necessary truths are \\"necessarily necessary\\". If such perplexities are deemed forced and artificial, this defect of K is not a great one. In any case, different answers to such questions yield different systems of modal logic. Adding axioms to K gives rise to other well-known modal systems. One cannot prove in K that if \\"p is necessary\\" then p is true. The axiom T remedies this defect: *T, Reflexivity Axiom: (If p is necessary, then p is the case.) T holds in most but not all modal logics. Zeman (1973) describes a few exceptions, such as S10. Other well-known elementary axioms are: *4: \\\\Box p \\\\to \\\\Box \\\\Box p *B: p \\\\to \\\\Box \\\\Diamond p *D: \\\\Box p \\\\to \\\\Diamond p *5: \\\\Diamond p \\\\to \\\\Box \\\\Diamond p These yield the systems (axioms in bold, systems in italics): *K := K + N *T := K + T *S4 := T + 4 *S5 := T + 5 *D := K + D. K through S5 form a nested hierarchy of systems, making up the core of normal modal logic. But specific rules or sets of rules may be appropriate for specific systems. For example, in deontic logic, \\\\Box p \\\\to \\\\Diamond p (If it ought to be that p, then it is permitted that p) seems appropriate, but we should probably not include that p \\\\to \\\\Box \\\\Diamond p. In fact, to do so is to commit the appeal to nature fallacy (i.e. to state that what is natural is also good, by saying that if p is the case, p ought to be permitted). The commonly employed system S5 simply makes all modal truths necessary. For example, if p is possible, then it is \\"necessary\\" that p is possible. Also, if p is necessary, then it is necessary that p is necessary. Other systems of modal logic have been formulated, in part because S5 does not describe every kind of modality of interest. =Structural proof theory= Sequent calculi and systems of natural deduction have been developed for several modal logics, but it has proven hard to combine generality with other features expected of good structural proof theories, such as purity (the proof theory does not introduce extra-logical notions such as labels) and analyticity (the logical rules support a clean notion of analytic proof). More complex calculi have been applied to modal logic to achieve generality. =Decision methods= Analytic tableaux provide the most popular decision method for modal logics. Modal logics in philosophy =Alethic logic= Modalities of necessity and possibility are called alethic modalities. They are also sometimes called special modalities, from the Latin species. Modal logic was first developed to deal with these concepts, and only afterward was extended to others. For this reason, or perhaps for their familiarity and simplicity, necessity and possibility are often casually treated as the subject matter of modal logic. Moreover, it is easier to make sense of relativizing necessity, e.g. to legal, physical, nomological, epistemic, and so on, than it is to make sense of relativizing other notions. In classical modal logic, a proposition is said to be *possible if it is not necessarily false (regardless of whether it is actually true or actually false); *necessary if it is not possibly false (i.e. true and necessarily true); *contingent if it is not necessarily false and not necessarily true (i.e. possible but not necessarily true); *impossible if it is not possibly true (i.e. false and necessarily false). In classical modal logic, therefore, the notion of either possibility or necessity may be taken to be basic, where these other notions are defined in terms of it in the manner of De Morgan duality. Intuitionistic modal logic treats possibility and necessity as not perfectly symmetric. For example, suppose that while walking to the convenience store we pass Friedrich's house, and observe that the lights are off. On the way back, we observe that they have been turned on. * \\"Somebody or something turned the lights on\\" is necessary. * \\"Friedrich turned the lights on\\", \\"Friedrich's roommate Max turned the lights on\\" and \\"A burglar named Adolf broke into Friedrich's house and turned the lights on\\" are contingent. * All of the above statements are possible. * It is impossible that Socrates (who has been dead for over two thousand years) turned the lights on. (Of course, this analogy does not apply alethic modality in a truly rigorous fashion; for it to do so, it would have to axiomatically make such statements as \\"human beings cannot rise from the dead\\", \\"Socrates was a human being and not an immortal vampire\\", and \\"we did not take hallucinogenic drugs which caused us to falsely believe the lights were on\\", ad infinitum. Absolute certainty of truth or falsehood exists only in the sense of logically constructed abstract concepts such as \\"it is impossible to draw a triangle with four sides\\" and \\"all bachelors are unmarried\\".) For those with difficulty with the concept of something being possible but not true, the meaning of these terms may be made more comprehensible by thinking of multiple \\"possible worlds\\" (in the sense of Leibniz) or \\"alternate universes\\"; something \\"necessary\\" is true in all possible worlds, something \\"possible\\" is true in at least one possible world. These \\"possible world semantics\\" are formalized with Kripke semantics. Physical possibility Something is physically, or nomically, possible if it is permitted by the laws of physics. For example, current theory is thought to allow for there to be an atom with an atomic number of 126, even if there are no such atoms in existence. In contrast, while it is logically possible to accelerate beyond the speed of light, See also Feinberg's later paper: Phys. Rev. D 17, 1651 (1978) modern science stipulates that it is not physically possible for material particles or information. Metaphysical possibility Philosophers debate if objects have properties independent of those dictated by scientific laws. For example, it might be metaphysically necessary, as some who advocate physicalism have thought, that all thinking beings have bodies and can experience the passage of time. Saul Kripke has argued that every person necessarily has the parents they do have: anyone with different parents would not be the same person.Saul Kripke. Naming and Necessity. Harvard University Press, 1980. pg 113 Metaphysical possibility has been thought to be more restricting than bare logical possibility (i.e., fewer things are metaphysically possible than are logically possible). However, its exact relation (if any) to logical possibility or to physical possibility is a matter of dispute. Philosophers also disagree over whether metaphysical truths are necessary merely \\"by definition\\", or whether they reflect some underlying deep facts about the world, or something else entirely. =Epistemic logic= Epistemic modalities (from the Greek episteme, knowledge), deal with the certainty of sentences. The ‚ñ° operator is translated as \\"x knows that‚Ä¶\\", and the ‚óá operator is translated as \\"For all x knows, it may be true that‚Ä¶\\" In ordinary speech both metaphysical and epistemic modalities are often expressed in similar words; the following contrasts may help: A person, Jones, might reasonably say both: (1) \\"No, it is not possible that Bigfoot exists; I am quite certain of that\\"; and, (2) \\"Sure, it's possible that Bigfoots could exist\\". What Jones means by (1) is that, given all the available information, there is no question remaining as to whether Bigfoot exists. This is an epistemic claim. By (2) he makes the metaphysical claim that it is possible for Bigfoot to exist, even though he does not: there is no physical or biological reason that large, featherless, bipedal creatures with thick hair could not exist in the forests of North America (regardless of whether or not they do). Similarly, \\"it is possible for the person reading this sentence to be fourteen feet tall and named Chad\\" is metaphysically true (such a person would not somehow be prevented from doing so on account of their height and name), but not alethically true unless you match that description, and not epistemically true if it's known that fourteen-foot-tall human beings have never existed. From the other direction, Jones might say, (3) \\"It is possible that Goldbach's conjecture is true; but also possible that it is false\\", and also (4) \\"if it is true, then it is necessarily true, and not possibly false\\". Here Jones means that it is epistemically possible that it is true or false, for all he knows (Goldbach's conjecture has not been proven either true or false), but if there is a proof (heretofore undiscovered), then it would show that it is not logically possible for Goldbach's conjecture to be false‚Äîthere could be no set of numbers that violated it. Logical possibility is a form of alethic possibility; (4) makes a claim about whether it is possible (i.e., logically speaking) that a mathematical truth to have been false, but (3) only makes a claim about whether it is possible, for all Jones knows, (i.e., speaking of certitude) that the mathematical claim is specifically either true or false, and so again Jones does not contradict himself. It is worthwhile to observe that Jones is not necessarily correct: It is possible (epistemically) that Goldbach's conjecture is both true and unprovable.See Goldbach's conjecture ‚Äì Origins Epistemic possibilities also bear on the actual world in a way that metaphysical possibilities do not. Metaphysical possibilities bear on ways the world might have been, but epistemic possibilities bear on the way the world may be (for all we know). Suppose, for example, that I want to know whether or not to take an umbrella before I leave. If you tell me \\"it is possible that it is raining outside\\" ‚Äì in the sense of epistemic possibility ‚Äì then that would weigh on whether or not I take the umbrella. But if you just tell me that \\"it is possible for it to rain outside\\" ‚Äì in the sense of metaphysical possibility ‚Äì then I am no better off for this bit of modal enlightenment. Some features of epistemic modal logic are in debate. For example, if x knows that p, does x know that it knows that p? That is to say, should ‚ñ°P ‚Üí ‚ñ°‚ñ°P be an axiom in these systems? While the answer to this question is unclear,cf. Blindsight and Subliminal perception for negative empirical evidence there is at least one axiom that is generally included in epistemic modal logic, because it is minimally true of all normal modal logics (see the section on axiomatic systems): * K, Distribution Axiom: \\\\Box (p \\\\to q) \\\\to (\\\\Box p \\\\to \\\\Box q). It has been questioned whether the epistemic and alethic modalities should be considered distinct from each other. The criticism states that there is no real difference between \\"the truth in the world\\" (alethic) and \\"the truth in an individual's mind\\" (epistemic). An investigation has not found a single language in which alethic and epistemic modalities are formally distinguished, as by the means of a grammatical mood. =Temporal logic= Temporal logic is an approach to the semantics of expressions with tense, that is, expressions with qualifications of when. Some expressions, such as '2 + 2 = 4', are true at all times, while tensed expressions such as 'John is happy' are only true sometimes. In temporal logic, tense constructions are treated in terms of modalities, where a standard method for formalizing talk of time is to use two pairs of operators, one for the past and one for the future (P will just mean 'it is presently the case that P'). For example: :FP : It will sometimes be the case that P :GP : It will always be the case that P :PP : It was sometime the case that P :HP : It has always been the case that P There are then at least three modal logics that we can develop. For example, we can stipulate that, : \\\\Diamond P = P is the case at some time t : \\\\Box P = P is the case at every time t Or we can trade these operators to deal only with the future (or past). For example, : \\\\Diamond_1 P = FP : \\\\Box_1 P = GP or, : \\\\Diamond_2 P = P and/or FP : \\\\Box_2 P = P and GP The operators F and G may seem initially foreign, but they create normal modal systems. Note that FP is the same as ¬¨G¬¨P. We can combine the above operators to form complex statements. For example, PP ‚Üí ‚ñ°PP says (effectively), Everything that is past and true is necessary. It seems reasonable to say that possibly it will rain tomorrow, and possibly it won't; on the other hand, since we can't change the past, if it is true that it rained yesterday, it probably isn't true that it may not have rained yesterday. It seems the past is \\"fixed\\", or necessary, in a way the future is not. This is sometimes referred to as accidental necessity. But if the past is \\"fixed\\", and everything that is in the future will eventually be in the past, then it seems plausible to say that future events are necessary too. Similarly, the problem of future contingents considers the semantics of assertions about the future: is either of the propositions 'There will be a sea battle tomorrow', or 'There will not be a sea battle tomorrow' now true? Considering this thesis led Aristotle to reject the principle of bivalence for assertions concerning the future. Additional binary operators are also relevant to temporal logics, q.v. Linear Temporal Logic. Versions of temporal logic can be used in computer science to model computer operations and prove theorems about them. In one version, ‚óáP means \\"at a future time in the computation it is possible that the computer state will be such that P is true\\"; ‚ñ°P means \\"at all future times in the computation P will be true\\". In another version, ‚óáP means \\"at the immediate next state of the computation, P might be true\\"; ‚ñ°P means \\"at the immediate next state of the computation, P will be true\\". These differ in the choice of Accessibility relation. (P always means \\"P is true at the current computer state\\".) These two examples involve nondeterministic or not-fully-understood computations; there are many other modal logics specialized to different types of program analysis. Each one naturally leads to slightly different axioms. =Deontic logic= Likewise talk of morality, or of obligation and norms generally, seems to have a modal structure. The difference between \\"You must do this\\" and \\"You may do this\\" looks a lot like the difference between \\"This is necessary\\" and \\"This is possible\\". Such logics are called deontic, from the Greek for \\"duty\\". Deontic logics commonly lack the axiom T semantically corresponding to the reflexivity of the accessibility relation in Kripke semantics: in symbols, \\\\Box\\\\phi\\\\to\\\\phi. Interpreting ‚ñ° as \\"it is obligatory that\\", T informally says that every obligation is true. For example, if it is obligatory not to kill others (i.e. killing is morally forbidden), then T implies that people actually do not kill others. The consequent is obviously false. Instead, using Kripke semantics, we say that though our own world does not realize all obligations, the worlds accessible to it do (i.e., T holds at these worlds). These worlds are called idealized worlds. P is obligatory with respect to our own world if at all idealized worlds accessible to our world, P holds. Though this was one of the first interpretations of the formal semantics, it has recently come under criticism.See, e.g., One other principle that is often (at least traditionally) accepted as a deontic principle is D, \\\\Box\\\\phi\\\\to\\\\Diamond\\\\phi, which corresponds to the seriality (or extendability or unboundedness) of the accessibility relation. It is an embodiment of the Kantian idea that \\"ought implies can\\". (Clearly the \\"can\\" can be interpreted in various senses, e.g. in a moral or alethic sense.) Intuitive problems with deontic logic When we try to formalize ethics with standard modal logic, we run into some problems. Suppose that we have a proposition K: you have stolen some money, and another, Q: you have stolen a small amount of money. Now suppose we want to express the thought that \\"if you have stolen some money, it ought to be a small amount of money\\". There are two likely candidates, : (1) (K \\\\to \\\\Box Q) : (2) \\\\Box (K \\\\to Q) But (1) and K together entail ‚ñ°Q, which says that it ought to be the case that you have stolen a small amount of money. This surely isn't right, because you ought not to have stolen anything at all. And (2) doesn't work either: If the right representation of \\"if you have stolen some money it ought to be a small amount\\" is (2), then the right representation of (3) \\"if you have stolen some money then it ought to be a large amount\\" is \\\\Box (K \\\\to (K \\\\land \\\\lnot Q)). Now suppose (as seems reasonable) that you ought not to steal anything, or \\\\Box \\\\lnot K. But then we can deduce \\\\Box (K \\\\to (K \\\\land \\\\lnot Q)) via \\\\Box (\\\\lnot K) \\\\to \\\\Box (K \\\\to K \\\\land \\\\lnot K) and \\\\Box (K \\\\land \\\\lnot K \\\\to (K \\\\land \\\\lnot Q)) (the contrapositive of Q \\\\to K); so sentence (3) follows from our hypothesis (of course the same logic shows sentence (2)). But that can't be right, and is not right when we use natural language. Telling someone they should not steal certainly does not imply that they should steal large amounts of money if they do engage in theft.Ted Sider's Logic for Philosophy, unknown page. http://tedsider.org/books/lfp.html = Doxastic logic = Doxastic logic concerns the logic of belief (of some set of agents). The term doxastic is derived from the ancient Greek doxa which means \\"belief\\". Typically, a doxastic logic uses ‚ñ°, often written \\"B\\", to mean \\"It is believed that\\", or when relativized to a particular agent s, \\"It is believed by s that\\".  Metaphysical questions  In the most common interpretation of modal logic, one considers \\"logically possible worlds\\". If a statement is true in all possible worlds, then it is a necessary truth. If a statement happens to be true in our world, but is not true in all possible worlds, then it is a contingent truth. A statement that is true in some possible world (not necessarily our own) is called a possible truth. Under this \\"possible worlds idiom,\\" to maintain that Bigfoot's existence is possible but not actual, one says, \\"There is some possible world in which Bigfoot exists; but in the actual world, Bigfoot does not exist\\". However, it is unclear what this claim commits us to. Are we really alleging the existence of possible worlds, every bit as real as our actual world, just not actual? Saul Kripke believes that 'possible world' is something of a misnomer ‚Äì that the term 'possible world' is just a useful way of visualizing the concept of possibility.Kripke, Saul. Naming and Necessity. (1980; Harvard UP), pp. 43‚Äì5. For him, the sentences \\"you could have rolled a 4 instead of a 6\\" and \\"there is a possible world where you rolled a 4, but you rolled a 6 in the actual world\\" are not significantly different statements, and neither commit us to the existence of a possible world.Kripke, Saul. Naming and Necessity. (1980; Harvard UP), pp. 15‚Äì6. David Lewis, on the other hand, made himself notorious by biting the bullet, asserting that all merely possible worlds are as real as our own, and that what distinguishes our world as actual is simply that it is indeed our world ‚Äì this world.David Lewis, On the Plurality of Worlds (1986; Blackwell) That position is a major tenet of \\"modal realism\\". Some philosophers decline to endorse any version of modal realism, considering it ontologically extravagant, and prefer to seek various ways to paraphrase away these ontological commitments. Robert Adams holds that 'possible worlds' are better thought of as 'world-stories', or consistent sets of propositions. Thus, it is possible that you rolled a 4 if such a state of affairs can be described coherently.Adams, Robert M. Theories of Actuality. No√ªs, Vol. 8, No. 3 (Sep., 1974), particularly pp. 225‚Äì31. Computer scientists will generally pick a highly specific interpretation of the modal operators specialized to the particular sort of computation being analysed. In place of \\"all worlds\\", you may have \\"all possible next states of the computer\\", or \\"all possible future states of the computer\\". Further applications Modal logics have begun to be used in areas of the humanities such as literature, poetry, art and history.See and Andrew H. Miller, \\"Lives Unled in Realist Fiction\\", Representations 98, Spring 2007, The Regents of the University of California, , pp. 118‚Äì134. History The basic ideas of modal logic date back to antiquity. Aristotle developed a modal syllogistic in Book I of his Prior Analytics (chs 8‚Äì22), which Theophrastus attempted to improve. There are also passages in Aristotle's work, such as the famous sea-battle argument in De Interpretatione ¬ß9, that are now seen as anticipations of the connection of modal logic with potentiality and time. In the Hellenistic period, the logicians Diodorus Cronus, Philo the Dialectician and the Stoic Chrysippus each developed a modal system that accounted for the interdefinability of possibility and necessity, accepted axiom T (see below), and combined elements of modal logic and temporal logic in attempts to solve the notorious Master Argument.Bobzien, S. (1993). \\"Chrysippus' Modal Logic and its Relation to Philo and Diodorus\\", in K. Doering & Th. Ebert (eds), Dialektiker und Stoiker, Stuttgart 1993, pp. 63‚Äì84. The earliest formal system of modal logic was developed by Avicenna, who ultimately developed a theory of \\"temporally modal\\" syllogistic.History of logic: Arabic logic, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Modal logic as a self-aware subject owes much to the writings of the Scholastics, in particular William of Ockham and John Duns Scotus, who reasoned informally in a modal manner, mainly to analyze statements about essence and accident. C. I. Lewis founded modern modal logic in a series of scholarly articles beginning in 1912 with \\"Implication and the Algebra of Logic\\".Lewis, C. I. (1912). \\"Implication and the Algebra of Logic.\\" Mind, 21(84):522‚Äì531. Lewis was led to invent modal logic, and specifically strict implication, on the grounds that classical logic grants paradoxes of material implication such as the principle that a falsehood implies any proposition.Lewis, C. I. (1917). \\"The issues concerning material implication.\\" Journal of Philosophy, Psychology, and Scientific Methods, 14:350‚Äì356. This work culminated in his 1932 book Symbolic Logic (with C. H. Langford), which introduced the five systems S1 through S5. After Lewis, modal logic received little attention for several decades. Nicholas Rescher has argued that this was because Bertrand Russell rejected it. However, Jan Dejnozka has argued against this view, stating that a modal system which Dejnozka calls \\"MDL\\" is described in Russell's works, although Russell did believe the concept of modality to \\"come from confusing propositions with propositional functions,\\" as he wrote in The Analysis of Matter.; quote is cited from Arthur Norman Prior warned Ruth Barcan Marcus to prepare well in the debates concerning quantified modal logic with Willard Van Orman Quine, due to the biases against modal logic.Ruth Barcan Marcus, Modalities: Philosophical Essays, Oxford University Press, 1993, p. x. Ruth C. Barcan (later Ruth Barcan Marcus) developed the first axiomatic systems of quantified modal logic ‚Äî first and second order extensions of Lewis' S2, S4, and S5. The contemporary era in modal semantics began in 1959, when Saul Kripke (then only a 18-year-old Harvard University undergraduate) introduced the now-standard Kripke semantics for modal logics. These are commonly referred to as \\"possible worlds\\" semantics. Kripke and A. N. Prior had previously corresponded at some length. Kripke semantics is basically simple, but proofs are eased using semantic-tableaux or analytic tableaux, as explained by E. W. Beth. A. N. Prior created modern temporal logic, closely related to modal logic, in 1957 by adding modal operators [F] and [P] meaning \\"eventually\\" and \\"previously\\". Vaughan Pratt introduced dynamic logic in 1976. In 1977, Amir Pnueli proposed using temporal logic to formalise the behaviour of continually operating concurrent programs. Flavors of temporal logic include propositional dynamic logic (PDL), propositional linear temporal logic (PLTL), linear temporal logic (LTL), computation tree logic (CTL), Hennessy‚ÄìMilner logic, and T. The mathematical structure of modal logic, namely Boolean algebras augmented with unary operations (often called modal algebras), began to emerge with J. C. C. McKinsey's 1941 proof that S2 and S4 are decidable, and reached full flower in the work of Alfred Tarski and his student Bjarni J√≥nsson (J√≥nsson and Tarski 1951‚Äì52). This work revealed that S4 and S5 are models of interior algebra, a proper extension of Boolean algebra originally designed to capture the properties of the interior and closure operators of topology. Texts on modal logic typically do little more than mention its connections with the study of Boolean algebras and topology.

His later works were more abstract. His key influence related to bold use of colour and a clear love of experimentation with both depth and tone. Biography =Early life= Robert Delaunay was born in Paris, the son of George Delaunay and Countess Berthe F√©licie de Rose. While he was a child, Delaunay's parents divorced, and he was raised by his mother's sister Marie and her husband Charles Damour, in La Ronch√®re near Bourges. When he failed his final exam and said he wanted to become a painter, his uncle in 1902 sent him to Ronsin's atelier to study Decorative Arts in the Belleville district of Paris.D√ºchting: p7 At age 19, he left Ronsin to focus entirely on painting and contributed six works to the Salon des Ind√©pendants in 1904.Robert Delaunay ‚Äì Sonia Delaunay, 1999, He traveled to Brittany, where he was influenced by the group of Pont- Aven; and, in 1906, he contributed works he painted in Brittany to the 22nd Salon des Ind√©pendants, where he met Henri Rousseau. Delaunay formed a close friendship at this time with Jean Metzinger, with whom he shared an exhibition at a gallery run by Berthe Weill early in 1907. The two of them were singled out by the art critic Louis Vauxcelles in 1907 as Divisionists who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions. Robert Delaunay, Paysage au disque, 1906‚Äì07, oil on canvas, 55 x 46 cm, Mus√©e national d'art moderne (MNAM), Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris Robert Herbert writes: \\"Metzinger's Neo-Impressionist period was somewhat longer than that of his close friend Delaunay... The height of his Neo-Impressionist work was in 1906 and 1907, when he and Delaunay did portraits of each other (Art market, London, and Museum of Fine Arts, Houston) in prominent rectangles of pigment. (In the sky of Coucher de soleil no. 1, 1906‚Äì07, Collection Rijksmuseum Kr√∂ller-M√ºller, is the solar disk which Delaunay was later to make into a personal emblem).\\"Robert Herbert, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, 1968 Herbert describes the vibrating image of the sun in Metzinger's painting, and so too of Delaunay's Paysage au disque (1906‚Äì07), as \\"an homage to the decomposition of spectral light that lay at the heart of Neo-Impressionist color theory...\\"Rijksmuseum Kr√∂ller-M√ºller, Otterlo, Jean Metzinger, Coucher de soleil No. 1 Metzinger, followed closely by Delaunay‚Äîthe two often painting together in 1906 and 1907‚Äîwould develop a new sub-style of Neo-Impressionism that had great significance shortly thereafter within the context of their Cubist works. Piet Mondrian developed a similar mosaic-like Divisionist technique circa 1909. The Futurists later (1909‚Äì1916) would incorporate the style, under the influence of Gino Severini's Parisian works (from 1907 onward), into their dynamic paintings and sculpture. Robert Delaunay.

Retrieved April 4, 2020 In the prime of his career he painted a number of series that included: the Saint-S√©vrin series (1909‚Äì10); the City series (1909‚Äì1911); the Eiffel Tower series (1909‚Äì1912); the City of Paris series (1911‚Äì12); the Window series (1912‚Äì1914); the Cardiff Team series (1913); the Circular Forms series (1913); and The First Disk (1913). Delaunay is most closely identified with Orphism. From 1912 to 1914, he painted nonfigurative paintings based on the optical characteristics of brilliant colors that were so dynamic they would function as the form. His theories are mostly concerned with color and light and influenced many, including Stanton Macdonald-Wright, Morgan Russell, Patrick Henry Bruce, Der Blaue Reiter, August Macke, Franz Marc, Paul Klee, and Lyonel Feininger. Apollinaire was strongly influenced by Delaunay's theories of color and often quoted from them to explain Orphism. Delaunay's fixations with color as the expressive and structural means were sustained by his study of color. His writings on color, which were influenced by scientists and theoreticians, are intuitive and can sometimes be random statements based on the belief that color is a thing in itself, with its own powers of expression and form. He believes painting is a purely visual art that depends on intellectual elements, and perception is in the impact of colored light on the eye. The contrasts and harmonies of color produce in the eye simultaneous movements and correspond to movement in nature. Vision becomes the subject of painting. His early paintings are deeply rooted in Neoimpressionism. Night Scene, for example, has vigorous activity, with the use of lively brushstrokes in bright colors against a dark background, not defining solid objects but the areas that surround them. The spectral colors of Neoimpressionism were later abandoned. The Eiffel Tower series represented the fragmentation of solid objects and their merging with space. Influences in this series were C√©zanne, Analytical Cubism, and Futurism. In the Eiffel Tower the interpenetration of tangible objects and surrounding space is accompanied by the intense movement of geometric planes that are more dynamic than the static equilibrium of Cubist forms. In 1908, after a term in the military working as a regimental librarian, he met Sonia Terk; at the time she was married to a German art dealer whom she would soon divorce. In 1909, Delaunay began to paint a series of studies of the city of Paris and the Eiffel Tower, the Eiffel Tower series. The following year, he married Terk, and the couple settled in a studio apartment in Paris, where their son Charles was born in January 1911. The same year, at the invitation of Wassily Kandinsky, Delaunay joined The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter), a Munich-based group of artists. Delaunay was also successful in Germany, Switzerland, and Russia. He participated in the first Blanc Reiter exhibition in Munich and sold four works. Delaunay's paintings encouraged an enthusiastic response with Blaue Reiter. The Blaue Reiter connections led to Erwin Ritter von Busse's article \\"Robert Delaunay‚Äôs Methods of Compositions\\" which appeared in the 1912 Blaue Reiter Almanac. Delaunay would go to exhibit in February of that year, in the second Blaue Reiter exhibition in Munich and Valet de Carrean in Moscow. Robert Delaunay.

I was the heretic of Cubism. I had great arguments with my comrades who banned color from their palette, depriving it of all elemental mobility. I was accused of returning to Impressionism, of making decorative paintings, etc.‚Ä¶ I felt I had almost reached my goal.\\" 1912 was a turning point for Delaunay. On March 13 his first major exhibition in Paris closed after two weeks at the Galerie Barbazanges. The exhibition showed forty-six works from his early Impressionist works to his Cubist Eiffel Tower painting from 1909‚Äì1911. Art Critic Guillaume Apollinaire praised those works of the exhibition and proclaimed Delaunay as \\"an artist who has a monumental vision of the world.\\" In the March 23, 1912, issue of L'Assiette au Beurre, The first published suggestion that Delaunay had broken with this group of Cubists appeared, in James Burkley's review of that year's Salon des Ind√©pendants. Burkley wrote, \\"The Cubists, who occupy only a room, have multiplied. Their leaders, Picasso and Braque, have not participated in their grouping, and Delaunay, commonly labeled a Cubist, has wished to isolate himself and declare that he has nothing in common with Metzinger or Le Fauconnier.\\" With Apollinaire, Delaunay traveled to Berlin in January 1913 for an exhibition of his work at Galerie Der Sturm. On their way back to Paris, the two stayed with August Macke in Bonn, where Macke introduced them to Max Ernst.Willard Bohn: Apollinaire and the international avant-garde (1997), , p82 When his painting La ville de Paris was rejected by the Armory Show as being too bigLa ville de Paris measures 234 x 294 cm. he instructed Samuel Halpert to remove all his works from the show. =Spanish and Portuguese years (1914‚Äì1920)= At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 Sonia and Robert were staying in Fontarabie in Spain. They decided not to return to France and settled in Madrid. In August 1915 they moved to Portugal where they shared a home with Samuel Halpert and Eduardo Viana.Some sources mention an Eduardo Vianna With Viana and their friends Amadeo de Souza Cardoso (whom the Delaunays had already met in Paris) and Jos√© de Almada Negreiros they discussed an artistic partnership.D√ºchting: p51 First declared a deserter, Robert was declared unfit for military duty at the French consulate in Vigo on June 13, 1916. The Russian Revolution brought an end to the financial support Sonia received from her family in Russia, and a different source of income was needed. In 1917 the Delaunays met Sergei Diaghilev in Madrid. Robert designed the stage for his production of Cleopatra (costume design by Sonia Delaunay). Robert Delaunay illustrates Tour Eiffel for Vicente Huidobro. Paul Poiret refused a business partnership with Sonia in 1920, citing as one of the reasons her marriage to a deserter.Val√©rie Guillaume: Sonia und Tissus Delaunay.

When World War II erupted, the Delaunays moved to the Auvergne, in an effort to avoid the invading German forces. Suffering from cancer, Delaunay was unable to endure being moved around, and his health deteriorated. He died from cancer on 25 October 1941 in Montpellier at the age of 56. His body was reburied in 1952 in Gambais.

It is most closely associated with the performances of British and Irish artists such as Finbar Furey and his son Martin Furey, Old Blind Dogs, Michael McGoldrick, Riverdance, Lunasa, Donie Keyes and Davy Spillane, and is increasingly accepted as a feature of Celtic music. The low whistle is often used for the playing of airs and slow melodies due to its haunting and delicate sound. However, it is also becoming used more often for the playing of jigs, reels and hornpipes from the Irish, Scottish, Manx, Welsh and English traditions. A reason put forward for this being, it's easier to produce some ornamentation on the whistle, due to the size of the finger holes. The most common low whistle is the \\"Low D\\", pitched one octave below the traditional D whistle. A whistle is generally classed as a low whistle if its lowest note is the G above middle C or lower. Whistles higher than this are termed \\"soprano\\" or \\"high\\" whistles when a distinction is necessary. Low whistles operate on the same principles, and are generally fingered in the same way as traditional pennywhistles although for many, a \\"piper's grip\\" may be required due to the distance between the holes. They belong to the same woodwind instrument family of end-blown fipple flutes. Though the tone of this instrument varies subtly among makers, low whistles are generally characterised by a more breathy, flute-like sound than traditional tin whistles. Early history While the precise history of the low whistle is often debated, it is known that various kinds of vertical fipple flutes have existed in antiquity. The fipple flutes developed during the 16th century were the ancestors of today's low whistle, carrying through from early transverse flutes the six-holed design tradition and conical bore shape. They were originally of wooden construction, but the late 17th century saw more extensive use of metals such as brass and nickel. The metal was usually rolled and soldered, and further developments included the use of a tuning slide. These metal vertical flutes were found throughout Ireland, Britain, the Scandinavian peninsula, Canada and Flanders. The modern low whistle English flute maker and jazz musician Bernard Overton (1930-2008) is credited with producing the first modern low whistle in late 1971, which he made with Finbar Furey after Furey's prized Indian bamboo whistle was destroyed while on tour. Unable to repair it, Overton attempted to produce a metal replica and Finbar and himself spent many hours in the shed at the back of Bernard's house in Rugby, designing, testing and ultimately perfecting the flute. The first few were named the Furey/Overton flute but when Bernard gave up his job to hand make them full-time, they decided to market them as The Overton Flute. The first resulting instrument was essentially an oversized tin whistle made of copper pipe with a wooden plug but was quickly replaced by the aluminium one. While Overton was unsatisfied with its performance, he subsequently refined the design with an all-aluminium construction, producing a whistle in A. Impressed, Finbar requested a G version for his trademark Lonesome Boatman performances. Later, according to Overton, Hence, the expression \\"Irish low whistle\\" is not denoting an Irish origin, but just an intensive use of this instrument in Ireland and, because of cultural similarity, in the whole British archipelago. While before long several notable instrument makersIncluding, among others, Brian Howard, Phil Hardy, Colin Goldie, Dave Shaw (who pursued a rolled conical design), and Jon Swayne (a tunable wooden design) were producing low whistles, it is usually the Riverdance tour of the 1990s that is credited with giving the low whistle commercial exposure and recognition outside traditional music circles. Of particular note is Davy Spillane, whose work in fusing the sound of traditional instruments such as the low whistle with modern jazz or RnB, for example, has done much for the instrument's visibility. Some of the most famous low whistle players are: Michael McGoldrick, Kevin Crawford, Phil Hardy from England, Davy Spillane, Paddy Keenan, John McSherry from Ireland, Brian Finnegan from Northern Ireland, Fred Morrison, Rory Campbell, Tony Hinnigan and Ross Ainslie from Scotland. =In British and Irish culture and traditional music= Unlike the regular pennywhistle, the low whistle is a relative newcomer to folk music, and some criticise it for attempting to fill a musical role already well served by the tin whistle and Irish flute. To others it is viewed as a \\"transition instrument\\" for players seeking to eventually learn the seemingly more prestigious (and expensive) flute or uilleann pipes. While it is true that many skills learnt on the low whistle carry over to these instruments, \\"some of the greatest players of traditional music have been associated with the low whistle\\" and have helped foster its reputation as a highly versatile and respected instrument in its own right, with a unique and evocative sound. Much like the Irish flat-backed bouzouki, the low whistle can be seen as a product of a period when experiments in instrumentation were commonplace in traditional music, and musicians sought diverse and innovative means of expression.

In agriculture, a pulper is a machine designed to remove pulp (i.e. the soft flesh) from agricultural produce. For example, in coffee growing the ripe red cherries are picked from the coffee bushes and before fermentation and later drying the soft pulp needs to be removed (otherwise a potentially uncontrollable fermentation/rot will occur). In the case of coffee the pulping is normally done in a pulper that is either hand-cranked or engine-driven; the beans are emptied into an elevated hopper and then dropped through a narrow slot within which they come into contact with a rotating spiked drum that removes the pulp or flesh. Again in the case of coffee, the sticky beans that result from this process then have to be washed, fermented, washed again and dried before further processing (milling to remove the parchment) and then roasting. In paper making, a pulper is a machine that produces pulp from cellulose fibres; this pulp can directly be used by a paper machine.http://www.pulppapermill.com/pulper/ In Fufu Powder making, a pulper is a machine that is used to pulp the fermented cassava to remove Fibre before sendimentation. https://thenationonlineng.net/starting-production-fufu-powder/ Post-consumer waste is re-pulped, in one of the processes involved in recycling it.

He began his career directing television in Canada and later in the U.S. By the late 1950s he began directing films, most often comedies. He also directed dramas and romantic subjects, such as Love Story (1970), which was nominated for seven Oscars. Hiller collaborated on films with screenwriters Paddy Chayefsky and Neil Simon. Among his other films were The Americanization of Emily (1964), Tobruk (1967), The Hospital (1971), The Out-of-Towners (1970), Plaza Suite (1971), The Man in the Glass Booth (1975), Silver Streak (1976), The In-Laws (1979) and Outrageous Fortune (1987). Hiller served as president of the Directors Guild of America from 1989 to 1993 and president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from 1993 to 1997. He was the recipient of the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 2002. An annual film festival in Hiller's honor was held from 2006 until 2009 at his alma mater, Victoria School of Performing and Visual Arts. Early life and military service Hiller was born in November 1923 in Edmonton, Alberta, the son of Rose (Garfin) and Harry Hiller. His family was Jewish, and had emigrated from Poland in 1912. He had two sisters, one thirteen years older and one eleven years older. His father operated a second-hand musical instruments store in Edmonton. Hiller recalled that when he occasionally traveled home while he was in college, the Black people he met with \\"treated me like a king. Why? Because they loved my father. They told me that unlike other shopkeepers, he treated them like normal folks when they went to his store. He didn't look down on them\\".Grodin, Charles. If I Only Knew Then ... Learning from Our Mistakes, Springboard Press (2007) p. 78 Although his parents were not professionals in theater or had much money, notes Hiller, they enjoyed putting on a Jewish play once or twice a year for the Jewish community of 450 people, mainly to keep in touch with their heritage. Hiller recalls they started up the Yiddish theater when he was seven or eight years old; he helped set carpenters build and decorate the sets. When he was eleven, he got a role acting as an old man, wearing a long beard and the payot. He says that \\"the love of theater and music and literature my parents instilled in me\\" contributed to his later choosing to direct TV and films.King, Alan. Matzo Balls for Breakfast: and Other Memories of Growing Up Jewish, Simon & Schuster (2004) p. 215 After he graduated from high school, he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1941 during World War II. He served as a navigator on four-engine Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers on night missions over Nazi-controlled territory in Europe.http://www.dominion.ca/Downloads/sor_ArthurHiller.pdf After he returned from serving in the military, Hiller enrolled in and later graduated from University College, Toronto with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1947. After Israel was declared a state in 1948, he and his wife unsuccessfully tried to join its army since it came under attack. He continued in college and received a Master of Arts degree in psychology in 1950. One of his first jobs after graduating was with Canadian radio directing various public affairs programs. Directing career Hiller began his career as a television director with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. NBC, one of the main networks in the United States, seeing his work in Canada, offered him positions directing television dramas. Over the next few years, his work for the small screen included episodes of Thriller, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, The Rifleman, Gunsmoke, Naked City, Perry Mason, and Playhouse 90. =1950s‚Äì1960s= Hiller directed his first film, The Careless Years (1957), the story of young couple eloping. This was followed by This Rugged Land (1962), originally made for television but then released as a film, and then Miracle of the White Stallions (1963), a Disney film. With these first films, Hiller already showed competence in directing unrelated subjects successfully. He next directed a satirical anti- war comedy by screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky, The Americanization of Emily (1964), starring James Garner and Julie Andrews. It was the first of two film collaborations with Chayefsky. The film, nominated for two Academy Awards, would establish Hiller as a notable Hollywood director and, according to critics, \\"earned him a reputation for flair with sophisticated comedy.\\" The New York Times critic Bosley Crowther wrote that Hiller's \\"brisk direction\\" of Chayefsky's script included some \\"remarkably good writing with some slashing irreverence.\\"Crowther, Bosley. The Americanization of Emily review, The New York Times, 28 October 1966. In 1964 Hiller also directed the first episode of the television series The Addams Family. This was followed by the comedy Promise Her Anything (1965), with Warren Beatty and Leslie Caron and Penelope (1966), starring Natalie Wood. In a move away from comedy, he directed the desert warfare drama, Tobruk (1967), starring Rock Hudson and George Peppard, about a North African Campaign during World War II. The film was nominated for one Academy Award and showed Hiller capable of handling action films as well as comedy. Around the same time, he returned to comedy with The Tiger Makes Out (also 1967), starring Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson, and featured Dustin Hoffman's film debut. Popi (1969), recounts the tale of a Puerto Rican widower, starring Alan Arkin, struggling to raise his two young sons in the New York City neighborhood known as Spanish Harlem. Arkin was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor.Alan Arkin Golden Globe nominations, Golden Globe Awards =1970s= Hiller directed Love Story (1970), his best known work and most successful at the box-office. The film stars Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw in a romantic tragedy, and it was nominated for 7 Academy Awards including Best Director. The American Film Institute ranks it No. 9 in their list of the greatest love stories. Critic Roger Ebert disagreed with some critics who felt the story was too contrived: \\"Why shouldn't we get a little misty during a story about young lovers separated by death? Hiller earns our emotional response because of the way he's directed the movie [...] The movie is mostly about life, however, not death. And because Hiller makes the lovers into individuals, of course we're moved by the film's conclusion. Why not?\\"Ebert, Roger. Roger Ebert's Four Star Reviews‚Äî1967‚Äì2007, Andrews McMeel Publishing (2007) p. 443 The following year Hiller again collaborated with screenwriter Paddy Chayevsky in directing The Hospital (1971), a satire starring George C. Scott which has been described as being his best film. It is a black comedy about disillusionment and chaos within a hospital setting. Chayevsky received the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. In directing the film, Hiller tried to create a sense of action and movement by keeping the camera mobile and using handheld cameras as much as possible. His goal was to have the camera reflect the chaos and confusion taking place in the hospital. \\"I've always liked that sort of realistic feel,\\" he states. \\"I wanted the feeling that the audience was peeking around the corner.\\" Hiller directed two comedy films in collaboration with playwright Neil Simon.Erskine, Thomas L. Video Versions: Film Adaptations of Plays on Video, Greenwood Press (2000) p. 258 The first film was The Out-of-Towners (1970), starring Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, who were both nominated for Golden Globe awards for their roles. Their next collaboration was Plaza Suite (1971), starring Walter Matthau, which was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture. Both films were driven by intense comedy dialogue and were considered \\"crisply directed\\" by reviewers. Hiller returned to directing serious drama with The Man in the Glass Booth (1975), starring Maximilian Schell, in a screen adaptation of a stage play written by Robert Shaw. Schell played the role of a man trying to deal with questions of self-identity and guilt as a survivor of the Holocaust during World War II. For his highly emotional role, Schell was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and the Golden Globe Award.\\"Maximilian Schell 1930-2014\\", CBS News Returning to comedy, Hiller directed Silver Streak (1976), starring Gene Wilder, Jill Clayburgh and Richard Pryor. The film was well received by critics and is rated No. 95 on the AFI's best comedy films. He directed another comedy, The In-Laws (1979), with Peter Falk and Alan Arkin, which was also a critical and commercial success.\\"The In-laws\\", Rottentomatoes, 90% rating =1980s= Hiller directed the film Making Love, which was released in February 1982, a story of a married man coming to terms with his homosexuality. Author! Author! (also 1982), starred Al Pacino. The following year Hiller directed Romantic Comedy (1983), starring Dudley Moore and Mary Steenburgen. His next comedy, The Lonely Guy (1984), starred Steve Martin as a greeting card writer and was followed by Teachers (1984), a comedy-drama film starring Nick Nolte. Outrageous Fortune (1987) stars Shelley Long and Bette Midler. The film was successful at the box office, with Midler being nominated or winning various awards. The film was followed by See No Evil, Hear No Evil (1989), another comedy again starring Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor. Pryor plays a blind man and Wilder a deaf man who work together to thwart a trio of murderous thieves. =1990s= The 1990s saw Hiller directing a number of films, most of which received negative or mixed reviews: Taking Care of Business (1990); The Babe (1992), a biographical film about Babe Ruth, portrayed by John Goodman; Married to It (1993) and Carpool (1996). In 1997, Hiller helmed the infamous flop An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn, which wound up living up to its title when Hiller requested his name be removed from the picture ‚Äì thus truly making it an Alan Smithee film. Nine years later, when he was in his eighties, Hiller directed his last film, National Lampoon's Pucked (2006), starring rock star Jon Bon Jovi. Influences In an interview with journalist Robert K. Elder for The Film That Changed My Life, Hiller states that the film Rome, Open City (1945) had had a strong influence on his career because he saw it right after leaving the military where he was a bomber navigator in the Canadian Air Force. The film is set during the Nazi occupation of Italy and shows the priesthood and the Communists teaming up against the enemy forces. Hiller commented, \\"You just get the strongest emotional feelings about what happened to people in Italy.\\"Hiller, Arthur. Interview with Robert K. Elder. The Film That Changed My Life, Chicago Review Press, 2011. p. 162 Hiller preferred his scripts to contain \\"good moral values,\\" a preference which he says came from his upbringing. He wanted high quality screenplays whenever possible, which partly explains why he collaborated on multiple films with both Paddy Chayefsky and Neil Simon.

Spivak is the author of the five-volume A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry. Biography Spivak was born in Queens, New York. He received an A.B. from Harvard University in 1960, while in 1964 he received a Ph.D. from Princeton University under the supervision of John Milnor, with thesis On Spaces Satisfying Poincar√© Duality. In 1985 Spivak received the Leroy P. Steele Prize. Spivak has lectured on elementary physics.Videos of Spivak's 2004 Pathway Lectures at Keio University and the text for Elementary mechanics from a mathematician's viewpoint. Spivak's most recent book, Physics for Mathematicians: Mechanics I, which contains the material that these lectures stemmed from and more, was published on December 6, 2010. Spivak is also the designer of the MathTime Professional 2 fonts (which are widely used in academic publishing) and the creator of Science International. Spivak coined Spivak pronouns, a set of English gender- neutral pronouns.  Writing  Among Spivak's pedagogical works, his five- volume magnum opus A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry (Publish or Perish Inc., 1970; 2nd ed., 1979; 3rd ed., 1999, revised 2005) is among his most influential and celebrated. The distinctive pedagogical aim of the work, as stated in its preface, was to elucidate for graduate students the often obscure relationship between classical differential geometry‚Äîgeometrically intuitive but imprecise‚Äîand its modern counterpart, replete with precise but unintuitive algebraic definitions. On several occasions, most prominently in Volume 2, Spivak \\"translates\\" the classical language that Gauss or Riemann would be familiar with to the abstract language that a modern differential geometer might use. The Leroy P. Steele Prize was awarded to Spivak in 1985 for his authorship of the work. Spivak has also authored several well-known undergraduate textbooks. Among them, his text Calculus (W. A. Benjamin Inc., 1967; Publish or Perish, 4th ed., 2008) takes a rigorous and theoretical approach to introductory calculus and includes proofs of many theorems taken on faith in most other introductory textbooks.When Spivak was writing his Calculus book, the current \\"popular\\" book was by Thomas. Spivak joked about naming his book, \\"Thomas's Calculus\\" [by Michael Spivak,] so that students who asked to buy Thomas's Calculus would end up with Spivak's book. Spivak acknowledges in the preface that others might consider this textbook to be an introduction to mathematical analysis rather than a calculus book. Another of his well-known textbooks is Calculus on Manifolds (W. A. Benjamin Inc., 1965; Addison-Wesley, revised edition, 1968), a concise (146 pp.) but rigorous and modern treatment of multivariable calculus accessible to advanced undergraduates.When Spivak receives the galley proofs of Calculus on Manifolds, the manuscript was proofread out loud (for $2/hour) by one of his roommates, J. Kowit, who has an autographed copy that reads \\"For Joel, who read every word, left parenthesis, and subscript. - Mike.\\" One of the references in the index reads, \\"Lac locus.\\" This relates to a period of time during which Spivak worked with a friend in the Biology Department of Brandeis, dealing with the lac operon, a set of genes whose study won the Nobel Prize for Jacob and Monod. These genes are named i, o, z, and y, and these letters can be found in the equations on page 106 - a very inside joke. Spivak has also written The Joy of TeX: A Gourmet Guide to Typesetting With the AMS-TeX Macro Package and The Hitchhiker's Guide to Calculus. The book Morse Theory, by John Milnor, was based on lecture notes by Spivak and Robert Wells (as mentioned on the cover page of the booklet).It is rumored that in each of Spivak's books there are hidden references to yellow pigs, an idea Spivak apparently came up with at a bar while drinking with David C. Kelly.

The term was historically applied either to a newly acquired region not yet constituted as an organized incorporated territory (e.g. the Louisiana Purchase prior to the establishment of Orleans Territory and the District of Louisiana), or to a region previously part of an organized incorporated territory left \\"unorganized\\" after part of it had been organized and achieved the requirements for statehood (e.g. a large portion of Missouri Territory became unorganized territory for several years after its southeastern section became the state of Missouri). The U.S. currently exercises sovereignty over ten unorganized territories: American Samoa (the only one with a native resident population), Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Atoll, Navassa Island, Palmyra Atoll (previously a part of the Territory of Hawaii, and the only one that is an incorporated U.S. territory) and Wake Island. U.S. Territories United States territorial growth from 1810 to 1920 An unorganized territory can also be a United States territory for which the United States Congress has not enacted an organic act. In this sense, unorganized territories are territories over which the federal U.S. government is sovereign but which are not located within any of the states of the Union and have not been \\"organized\\" into self-governing units. Currently, all federal unorganized territories are insular areas, administered by the Office of Insular Affairs, U.S. Department of the Interior. American Samoa is technically unorganized, in that Congress has not passed an organic act, but it is effectively self-governing, under the terms of a constitution last revised in 1967. As of , Palmyra Atoll (formerly part of the Territory of Hawaii) is the only unorganized incorporated U.S. territory. The other unorganized territories along with all of the organized territories are unincorporated. Incorporated territories are permanently part of the United States whereas unincorporated territories may be sold, leased or granted independence by the United States. At various times during the 19th century, large parts of the Great Plains were unorganized territory. After the Louisiana Purchase from France in 1803, the entire region was part of the Louisiana Territory until 1812 and the Missouri Territory until 1821. In 1821 the Missouri Compromise created the State of Missouri from the territory, and the rest of the region was left unorganized. The Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act of 1854 created the Kansas and Nebraska Territories, bringing organized government to the region once again. The creation of Kansas and Nebraska left the Indian Territory as the only unorganized territory in the Great Plains. In 1858, the western part of the Minnesota Territory became unorganized when it was not included in the new state of Minnesota; this area was organized in 1861 as part of the Dakota Territory. On May 2, 1890, the western half of the Indian Territory was organized as Oklahoma. The remainder was incorporated into the State of Oklahoma upon its admission to the union in 1907. Alaska was an unorganized territory between its acquisition from Russia in 1867 and the creation of Alaska Territory in 1912. Hawaii was as well from the time of its annexation by the U.S. in 1898 until organized as Hawaii Territory in 1900. U.S. Census Bureau Unorganized territories, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, occur in 10 minor civil division (MCD) states (Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, and South Dakota) where portions of counties are not included in any legally established MCD or independent incorporated place. The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes such separate pieces of territory as one or more separate county subdivisions for statistical purposes. It assigns each unorganized territory a descriptive name, followed by the designation \\"unorganized territory\\". Unorganized territories were first used for statistical purposes in conjunction with the 1960 census. At the 2000 census there were 305 of these territories within the United States. Their total land area was 85,392 square miles (221,165 km2) and they had a total population of 247,331. South Dakota had the most unorganized territories, 102, as well as the largest amount of land under that status: 39,785 square miles (103,042 km2), or 52.4% of the state's land area. North Dakota followed with 86 territories, 20,358 square miles (52,728 km2), or 29.5% of its land area. Maine was next with 36 territories, 14,052 square miles (36,396 km2), or 45.5% of its land area. Minnesota had 71 territories, 10,552 square miles (27,330 km2), or 13% of its land area. Several other states had small amounts of unorganized territory. The unorganized territory with the largest population was Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, a United States Marine Corps base with a census population of 34,452 inhabitants. In the 2010 census, unorganized territory areas were identified in nine U.S. states: Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, and South Dakota.

The book presents opinions on what qualities men and women should have to be attractive and gives advice on sexual technique, warnings about sexual health, and recipes to remedy sexual maladies. It gives lists of names for the penis and vagina, has a section on the interpretation of dreams, and briefly describes sex among animals. Interspersed with these there are a number of stories which are intended to give context and amusement. 'The Perfumed Garden' book.  History  According to the introduction of Colville's English translation, Mu·∏•ammad ibn Mu·∏•ammad al-Nafzawi probably wrote The Perfumed Garden sometime during the fifteenth century. Sheikh Nefzawi, full name Abu Abdullah Muhammad ben Umar Nafzawi, was born among the Berber Nefzawa tribe in the south of present-day Tunisia. He compiled at the request of the Hafsid ruler of Tunis, Ab≈´ FƒÅris  øAbd al- øAzƒ´z al-Mutawakkil, the present work. The reputation acquired by this work in the Arab world was similar to that of the Arabian Nights. Content of the book The Perfumed Garden is composed of an introduction followed by 21 chapters. Neither the first French translator nor Sir Richard Burton (who translated the text from the French version) give the 21st chapter. In these two translations, the book is about 100-page long. =Introduction= The author praises God for having given us the pleasures of love-making. He says that God endowed women with beauty to inspire men to make love to them. He says that men have a natural weakness for the love of women. He says that he is a Muslim, that there is only one God and that Mohammed is his prophet. He says that he is the servant of God. He says that he wrote this book in Tunis for the Grand Vizir. He says that he had divided his work into different chapters to make it easier to read and understand. =Chapter 1: Men worthy of praise= A man worthy of praise can easily get an erection, he is not quick to discharge and, once he has lost his sperm, his member is soon stiff again. His member is long enough to reach the end of his partner's vagina and large enough to fill it. A man whose penis is too small cannot please women. Nefzawi carries on with the fact that perfumes can excite women and that it is clever to use them. He tells the story of a man called Mocailma who used perfumes to possess a woman called Chedja, and it made wonders: she lost all her presence of mind and gave herself to him. It is at this point that three sexual positions are described for the first time: the man on top of the woman, who is lying on her back; the woman on all fours; the woman in prayer position, with her forehead on the ground and her buttocks in the air, elevated. After the story, the author adds that a man worthy of praise is anxious to please women. He takes care of his appearance; he is truthful and sincere; he is brave and generous; he can be trusted; he is a good conversationalist. However, he does not boast about his relationship with other women. To illustrate all this, the author tells the story of Bahloul, a buffoon who managed to make love to Hamdonna, the daughter of the King and the wife of the Grand Vizir. He first seduced her with his words. He then showed her his erected penis, which was strong and large. Upon doing this, she desired him and they made love. After they had climaxed, he kissed her lips and her breasts and then gave her cunnilingus. By that time, Bahloul was stiff again. They made love a second time; and then, when they had both climaxed, a third time. =Chapter 2: Women worthy of praise= A woman worthy of praise, according to Nefzawi has a perfect waist and is plump and lusty. She has black hair, large black eyes, an elegant nose, and vermilion lips. Her breath is of pleasant odour. Her breasts are full and firm. Her vulva does not emit a bad smell. Her hips are large. Her hands and her feet are of striking elegance. Furthermore, she speaks and laughs rarely. Nefzawi adds that she never leaves the house and that she is not treacherous. If her husband shows his intention to make love, she complies with it. She assists him in his affairs. She does not complain or cry much. When her husband is downhearted, she shares his troubles. In public, she hides her secret parts and does not let anyone see them. She always dresses well and avoids showing her husband what might be repugnant to him. At this point, the author tells the story of Dorerame, a slave who enjoyed making love with the most beautiful and well-born young women of his time, even if they belonged to other men. It is the longest story of the Perfumed Garden. We learn various things. For example, a woman says that a well-born lady could remain as long as six months without sex. We also learn that women can be very dangerous: he concludes this second chapter by saying that the moral of this tale is that \\"a man who falls in love with a woman imperils himself, and exposes himself to the greatest troubles.\\" =Chapter 3: Men who are to be held in contempt= Men who are misshapen, whose member is short, who do not make love with vigour or in a manner that gives women enjoyment, who skip foreplay, who are quick to discharge their sperm and leave their partner right after the ejaculation, are men who are held in contempt by women. Men who lie, who cannot be trusted, who conceal to their wives what they have been doing, except their adulterous affairs, are also men worthy of contempt. =Chapter 4: Women who are to be held in contempt= Translations =1886: Burton English translation= The Perfumed Garden first became widely known in the English-speaking world through a translation from the French in 1886 by Sir Richard Francis Burton. Burton mentions that he considers that the work can be compared to those of Aretin and Rabelais, and the French book Conjugal Love by Nicolas Venette. But what he believes makes The Perfumed Garden unique in the genre is \\"the seriousness with which the most lascivious and obscene matters are presented.\\" Burton points out that not all of the ideas in The Perfumed Garden are original: \\"For instance, all the record of Mo√ßama and of Chedja is taken from the work of Mohammed ben Djerir el Taberi; the description of the different positions for coition, as well as the movements applicable to them, are borrowed from Indian works; finally, the book Birds and Flowers by Azeddine el Mocadecci (Izz al-Din al-Mosadeqi) seems to have been consulted with respect to the interpretation of dreams.\\" The French manuscript that Burton translated from was one printed by Isidore Liseux in 1886. This manuscript's last chapter ‚Äî Chapter 21 ‚Äî was incomplete, apparently because it contained material on homosexuality and pederasty which had been removed. When Burton died in late 1890, he was working on a new translation of the original manuscript, including this missing chapter. The revised translation, due to be retitled The Scented Garden, was never published as Burton's wife Isabel burned the manuscript soon after his death. = 1976: Khawam French translation = A new French translation by Ren√© R. Khawam was published in 1976. = 1999: Colville English translation = In 1999, Jim Colville published the first English Perfumed Garden translated directly from the Arabic original. Of the Burton translation, he says, \\"details were expanded, episodes introduced and whole sections incorporated from other, non-Arabic, sources. The text is dressed up in a florid prose alien to the style of the original and many of the notes are sheer speculation. The result is a consistently exaggerated and bizarre misrepresentation of the original\\". Exaggeration on the part of Burton is vividly illustrated in Chapter 6, titled \\"Sexual Technique\\" in Colville's translation and \\"Concerning Everything That Is Favourable to the Act of Coition\\" in Burton's. Burton's translation is perhaps 25 pages long, lists 39 sex positions as well as 6 types of sexual movement, and gives creative names to many of these. Colville's translation is 2¬Ω pages long, and lists 12 unnamed sex positions. Inspiration for musical works In 1923 the English composer Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji wrote Le jardin parfum√©: Poem for Piano Solo.http://www.mus.ulaval.ca/roberge/srs/04-sourc.htm RAH Band released a single entitled ‚ÄúPerfumed Garden‚Äù in 1982. Omnium Gatherum, a Finnish melodic death metal band, also wrote a song called \\"The Perfumed Garden\\", released on their \\"Spirits and August Light\\" album in 2003. Ray Manzarek, inspired by this, recorded a track called Perfumed Garden for his solo album The Whole Thing Started With Rock & Roll, Now It's Out Of Control.

The J√§mthund is eponymous with J√§mtland, a province in the middle of Sweden. Lineage The breed falls under the mitochondrial DNA sub-clade referred to as d1 that is only found in northern Scandinavia. It is the result of a male dog-female wolf hybridization that occurred post-domestication. Subclade d1 originated 480‚Äì3,000 years ago and it includes all S√°mi-related breeds: Finnish Lapphund, Swedish Lapphund, Lapponian Herder, Swedish Elkhound, Norwegian Elkhound, Black Norwegian Elkhound and H√§llefors Elkhound. The maternal wolf sequence that contributed to these breeds has not been matched across Eurasia and its branch on the phylogenetic tree is rooted in the same sequence as the 33,000 year-old Altai dog (not a direct ancestor). :Refer: Ancient dog-wolf hybridization Appearance The dog should have a loosely curled tail that hangs on the back and is not too thin or too tightly curled; when relaxed the tail should hang straight down. This breed has erect ears with a wide space in between them, a medium to long muzzle, and a double coat of various shades of agouti. The eyes are brown. The size of the male is usually , weighing . Females are usually between , weighing . The Swedish Elkhound should be distinguished from the Norwegian Elkhound. The Norwegian Elkhound is much shorter and stockier than the Swedish Elkhound, and its tail shape is very different. It also has a black mask on the muzzle, whereas the Swedish Elkhound has a white muzzle, white cheeks and typical wolf markings. Temperament Although calm and affectionate with its family, the Swedish Elkhound can be dominant with other dogs and has a strong prey drive. A truly all-around canine, it can go from a hunting trip and back to the family hearth with great aplomb. It takes things in stride and does not get ruffled easily, making it a steady partner in the field or at home. The Swedish Elkhound is a happy learner who loves to please its owner. Exercise As with most breeds developed for hunting, the Swedish Elkhound requires a lot of regular exercise to stay fit, both physically and mentally. It quickly becomes bored if kept indoors for too long and can become destructive. Grooming Regular brushing is necessary to keep the dense undercoat from matting. Bathing should not be done too often because it tends to dry out the weather-resistant coat. History The Swedish Elkhound received official recognition as a breed in 1946, due to intensive work by Aksel Lindstr√∂m and others. Before that, both it and the Norwegian Elkhound were seen as the same breed. They are used for elk hunting and sled pulling. In the local dialect, it used to be referred to as a bear dog.

Archimedes' principle is a law of physics fundamental to fluid mechanics. It was formulated by Archimedes of Syracuse. Explanation A floating ship's weight Fp and its buoyancy Fa (Fb in the text) must be equal in size. In On Floating Bodies, Archimedes suggested that (c. 246 BC): Archimedes' principle allows the buoyancy of any floating object partially or fully immersed in a fluid to be calculated. The downward force on the object is simply its weight. The upward, or buoyant, force on the object is that stated by Archimedes' principle, above. Thus, the net force on the object is the difference between the magnitudes of the buoyant force and its weight. If this net force is positive, the object rises; if negative, the object sinks; and if zero, the object is neutrally buoyant‚Äîthat is, it remains in place without either rising or sinking. In simple words, Archimedes' principle states that, when a body is partially or completely immersed in a fluid, it experiences an apparent loss in weight that is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the immersed part of the body(s). Formula Consider a cuboid immersed in a fluid, with one (hence two: top and bottom) of its sides orthogonal to the direction of gravity (assumed constant across the cube's stretch). The fluid will exert a normal force on each face, but only the normal forces on top and bottom will contribute to buoyancy. The pressure difference between the bottom and the top face is directly proportional to the height (difference in depth of submersion). Multiplying the pressure difference by the area of a face gives a net force on the cuboid ‚Äì the buoyancy, equaling in size the weight of the fluid displaced by the cuboid. By summing up sufficiently many arbitrarily small cuboids this reasoning may be extended to irregular shapes, and so, whatever the shape of the submerged body, the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. :\\\\text{ weight of displaced fluid} = \\\\text{weight of object in vacuum} - \\\\text{weight of object in fluid}\\\\, The weight of the displaced fluid is directly proportional to the volume of the displaced fluid (if the surrounding fluid is of uniform density). The weight of the object in the fluid is reduced, because of the force acting on it, which is called upthrust. In simple terms, the principle states that the buoyant force (Fb) on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object, or the density (œÅ) of the fluid multiplied by the submerged volume (V) times the gravity (g)http://physics.bu.edu/~duffy/sc527_notes01/buoyant.html We can express this relation in the equation: : F_{b} = \\\\rho g V where F_{b} (Fa in the figure) denotes the buoyant force applied onto the submerged object, \\\\rho denotes the density of the fluid, V represents the volume of the displaced fluid and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Thus, among completely submerged objects with equal masses, objects with greater volume have greater buoyancy. Suppose a rock's weight is measured as 10 newtons when suspended by a string in a vacuum with gravity acting on it. Suppose that, when the rock is lowered into the water, it displaces water of weight 3 newtons. The force it then exerts on the string from which it hangs would be 10 newtons minus the 3 newtons of buoyant force: 10 ‚àí 3 = 7 newtons. Buoyancy reduces the apparent weight of objects that have sunk completely to the sea-floor. It is generally easier to lift an object through the water than it is to pull it out of the water. For a fully submerged object, Archimedes' principle can be reformulated as follows: :\\\\text{apparent immersed weight} = \\\\text{weight of object} - \\\\text{weight of displaced fluid}\\\\, then inserted into the quotient of weights, which has been expanded by the mutual volume : \\\\frac { \\\\text{density of object}} { \\\\text{density of fluid} } = \\\\frac { \\\\text{weight}} { \\\\text{weight of displaced fluid} } yields the formula below. The density of the immersed object relative to the density of the fluid can easily be calculated without measuring any volume is : \\\\frac { \\\\text {density of object}} { \\\\text{density of fluid} } = \\\\frac { \\\\text{weight}} { \\\\text{weight} - \\\\text{apparent immersed weight}}.\\\\, (This formula is used for example in describing the measuring principle of a dasymeter and of hydrostatic weighing.) Example: If you drop wood into water, buoyancy will keep it afloat. Example: A helium balloon in a moving car. When increasing speed or driving in a curve, the air moves in the opposite direction to the car's acceleration. However, due to buoyancy, the balloon is pushed \\"out of the way\\" by the air and will drift in the same direction as the car's acceleration. When an object is immersed in a liquid, the liquid exerts an upward force, which is known as the buoyant force, that is proportional to the weight of the displaced liquid. The sum force acting on the object, then, is equal to the difference between the weight of the object ('down' force) and the weight of displaced liquid ('up' force). Equilibrium, or neutral buoyancy, is achieved when these two weights (and thus forces) are equal.  Forces and equilibrium  The equation to calculate the pressure inside a fluid in equilibrium is: : \\\\mathbf{f}+\\\\operatorname{div}\\\\,\\\\sigma=0 where f is the force density exerted by some outer field on the fluid, and œÉ is the Cauchy stress tensor. In this case the stress tensor is proportional to the identity tensor: : \\\\sigma_{ij}=-p\\\\delta_{ij}.\\\\, Here Œ¥ij is the Kronecker delta. Using this the above equation becomes: : \\\\mathbf{f}= abla p.\\\\, Assuming the outer force field is conservative, that is it can be written as the negative gradient of some scalar valued function: : \\\\mathbf{f}=- abla\\\\Phi.\\\\, Then: : abla(p+\\\\Phi)=0 \\\\Longrightarrow p+\\\\Phi = \\\\text{constant}.\\\\, Therefore, the shape of the open surface of a fluid equals the equipotential plane of the applied outer conservative force field. Let the z-axis point downward. In this case the field is gravity, so Œ¶ = ‚àíœÅfgz where g is the gravitational acceleration, œÅf is the mass density of the fluid. Taking the pressure as zero at the surface, where z is zero, the constant will be zero, so the pressure inside the fluid, when it is subject to gravity, is : p=\\\\rho_f g z.\\\\, So pressure increases with depth below the surface of a liquid, as z denotes the distance from the surface of the liquid into it. Any object with a non-zero vertical depth will have different pressures on its top and bottom, with the pressure on the bottom being greater. This difference in pressure causes the upward buoyancy force. The buoyancy force exerted on a body can now be calculated easily, since the internal pressure of the fluid is known. The force exerted on the body can be calculated by integrating the stress tensor over the surface of the body which is in contact with the fluid: : \\\\mathbf{B}=\\\\oint \\\\sigma \\\\, d\\\\mathbf{A}. The surface integral can be transformed into a volume integral with the help of the Gauss theorem: : \\\\mathbf{B}=\\\\int \\\\operatorname{div}\\\\sigma \\\\, dV = -\\\\int \\\\mathbf{f}\\\\, dV = -\\\\rho_f \\\\mathbf{g} \\\\int\\\\,dV=-\\\\rho_f \\\\mathbf{g} V where V is the measure of the volume in contact with the fluid, that is the volume of the submerged part of the body, since the fluid doesn't exert force on the part of the body which is outside of it. The magnitude of buoyancy force may be appreciated a bit more from the following argument. Consider any object of arbitrary shape and volume V surrounded by a liquid. The force the liquid exerts on an object within the liquid is equal to the weight of the liquid with a volume equal to that of the object. This force is applied in a direction opposite to gravitational force, that is of magnitude: : B = \\\\rho_f V_\\\\text{disp}\\\\, g, \\\\, where œÅf is the density of the fluid, Vdisp is the volume of the displaced body of liquid, and g is the gravitational acceleration at the location in question. If this volume of liquid is replaced by a solid body of exactly the same shape, the force the liquid exerts on it must be exactly the same as above. In other words, the \\"buoyancy force\\" on a submerged body is directed in the opposite direction to gravity and is equal in magnitude to : B = \\\\rho_f V g. \\\\, The net force on the object must be zero if it is to be a situation of fluid statics such that Archimedes principle is applicable, and is thus the sum of the buoyancy force and the object's weight : F_\\\\text{net} = 0 = m g - \\\\rho_f V_\\\\text{disp} g \\\\, If the buoyancy of an (unrestrained and unpowered) object exceeds its weight, it tends to rise. An object whose weight exceeds its buoyancy tends to sink. Calculation of the upwards force on a submerged object during its accelerating period cannot be done by the Archimedes principle alone; it is necessary to consider dynamics of an object involving buoyancy. Once it fully sinks to the floor of the fluid or rises to the surface and settles, Archimedes principle can be applied alone. For a floating object, only the submerged volume displaces water. For a sunken object, the entire volume displaces water, and there will be an additional force of reaction from the solid floor. In order for Archimedes' principle to be used alone, the object in question must be in equilibrium (the sum of the forces on the object must be zero), therefore; : mg = \\\\rho_f V_\\\\text{disp} g, \\\\, and therefore : m = \\\\rho_f V_\\\\text{disp}. \\\\, showing that the depth to which a floating object will sink, and the volume of fluid it will displace, is independent of the gravitational field regardless of geographic location. : (Note: If the fluid in question is seawater, it will not have the same density (œÅ) at every location. For this reason, a ship may display a Plimsoll line.) It can be the case that forces other than just buoyancy and gravity come into play. This is the case if the object is restrained or if the object sinks to the solid floor. An object which tends to float requires a tension restraint force T in order to remain fully submerged. An object which tends to sink will eventually have a normal force of constraint N exerted upon it by the solid floor. The constraint force can be tension in a spring scale measuring its weight in the fluid, and is how apparent weight is defined. If the object would otherwise float, the tension to restrain it fully submerged is: : T = \\\\rho_f V g - m g . \\\\, When a sinking object settles on the solid floor, it experiences a normal force of: : N = m g - \\\\rho_f V g . \\\\, Another possible formula for calculating buoyancy of an object is by finding the apparent weight of that particular object in the air (calculated in Newtons), and apparent weight of that object in the water (in Newtons). To find the force of buoyancy acting on the object when in air, using this particular information, this formula applies: : Buoyancy force = weight of object in empty space ‚àí weight of object immersed in fluid The final result would be measured in Newtons. Air's density is very small compared to most solids and liquids. For this reason, the weight of an object in air is approximately the same as its true weight in a vacuum. The buoyancy of air is neglected for most objects during a measurement in air because the error is usually insignificant (typically less than 0.1% except for objects of very low average density such as a balloon or light foam). = Simplified model = Pressure distribution on an immersed cube Forces on an immersed cube Approximation of an arbitrary volume as a group of cubes A simplified explanation for the integration of the pressure over the contact area may be stated as follows: Consider a cube immersed in a fluid with the upper surface horizontal. The sides are identical in area, and have the same depth distribution, therefore they also have the same pressure distribution, and consequently the same total force resulting from hydrostatic pressure, exerted perpendicular to the plane of the surface of each side. There are two pairs of opposing sides, therefore the resultant horizontal forces balance in both orthogonal directions, and the resultant force is zero. The upward force on the cube is the pressure on the bottom surface integrated over its area. The surface is at constant depth, so the pressure is constant. Therefore, the integral of the pressure over the area of the horizontal bottom surface of the cube is the hydrostatic pressure at that depth multiplied by the area of the bottom surface. Similarly, the downward force on the cube is the pressure on the top surface integrated over its area. The surface is at constant depth, so the pressure is constant. Therefore, the integral of the pressure over the area of the horizontal top surface of the cube is the hydrostatic pressure at that depth multiplied by the area of the top surface. As this is a cube, the top and bottom surfaces are identical in shape and area, and the pressure difference between the top and bottom of the cube is directly proportional to the depth difference, and the resultant force difference is exactly equal to the weight of the fluid that would occupy the volume of the cube in its absence. This means that the resultant upward force on the cube is equal to the weight of the fluid that would fit into the volume of the cube, and the downward force on the cube is its weight, in the absence of external forces. This analogy is valid for variations in the size of the cube. If two cubes are placed alongside each other with a face of each in contact, the pressures and resultant forces on the sides or parts thereof in contact are balanced and may be disregarded, as the contact surfaces are equal in shape, size and pressure distribution, therefore the buoyancy of two cubes in contact is the sum of the buoyancies of each cube. This analogy can be extended to an arbitrary number of cubes. An object of any shape can be approximated as a group of cubes in contact with each other, and as the size of the cube is decreased, the precision of the approximation increases. The limiting case for infinitely small cubes is the exact equivalence. Angled surfaces do not nullify the analogy as the resultant force can be split into orthogonal components and each dealt with in the same way. Refinements Archimedes' principle does not consider the surface tension (capillarity) acting on the body. Moreover, Archimedes' principle has been found to break down in complex fluids.\\"Archimedes's principle gets updated\\". R. Mark Wilson, Physics Today 65(9), 15 (2012); There is an exception to Archimedes' principle known as the bottom (or side) case. This occurs when a side of the object is touching the bottom (or side) of the vessel it is submerged in, and no liquid seeps in along that side. In this case, the net force has been found to be different from Archimedes' principle, owing to the fact that since no fluid seeps in on that side, the symmetry of pressure is broken. Principle of flotation Archimedes' principle shows the buoyant force and displacement of fluid. However, the concept of Archimedes' principle can be applied when considering why objects float. Proposition 5 of Archimedes' treatise On Floating Bodies states that In other words, for an object floating on a liquid surface (like a boat) or floating submerged in a fluid (like a submarine in water or dirigible in air) the weight of the displaced liquid equals the weight of the object. Thus, only in the special case of floating does the buoyant force acting on an object equal the objects weight. Consider a 1-ton block of solid iron. As iron is nearly eight times as dense as water, it displaces only 1/8 ton of water when submerged, which is not enough to keep it afloat. Suppose the same iron block is reshaped into a bowl. It still weighs 1 ton, but when it is put in water, it displaces a greater volume of water than when it was a block. The deeper the iron bowl is immersed, the more water it displaces, and the greater the buoyant force acting on it. When the buoyant force equals 1 ton, it will sink no farther. When any boat displaces a weight of water equal to its own weight, it floats. This is often called the \\"principle of flotation\\": A floating object displaces a weight of fluid equal to its own weight. Every ship, submarine, and dirigible must be designed to displace a weight of fluid at least equal to its own weight. A 10,000-ton ship's hull must be built wide enough, long enough and deep enough to displace 10,000 tons of water and still have some hull above the water to prevent it from sinking. It needs extra hull to fight waves that would otherwise fill it and, by increasing its mass, cause it to submerge. The same is true for vessels in air: a dirigible that weighs 100 tons needs to displace 100 tons of air. If it displaces more, it rises; if it displaces less, it falls. If the dirigible displaces exactly its weight, it hovers at a constant altitude. While they are related to it, the principle of flotation and the concept that a submerged object displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own volume are not Archimedes' principle. Archimedes' principle, as stated above, equates the buoyant force to the weight of the fluid displaced. One common point of confusion regarding Archimedes' principle is the meaning of displaced volume. Common demonstrations involve measuring the rise in water level when an object floats on the surface in order to calculate the displaced water. This measurement approach fails with a buoyant submerged object because the rise in the water level is directly related to the volume of the object and not the mass (except if the effective density of the object equals exactly the fluid density). Proof of Concept carpeastra.co.uk Eureka Archimedes reportedly exclaimed \\"Eureka\\" after he realized how to detect whether a crown is made of impure gold. While he did not use Archimedes' principle in the widespread tale and only used displaced water for measuring the volume of the crown, there is an alternative approach using the principle: Balance the crown and pure gold on a scale in the air and then put the scale into water. According to Archimedes' principle, if the density of the crown differs from the density of pure gold, the scale will get out of balance under water.

The count of Flanders was the ruler or sub-ruler of the county of Flanders, beginning in the 9th century. The title was held for a time by the rulers of the Holy Roman Empire and Spain. During the French Revolution, in 1790, the county of Flanders was annexed to France and ceased to exist. In the 19th century, the title was appropriated by Belgium and granted twice to younger sons of Belgian kings. The most recent holder died in 1983. In 862 Baldwin I was appointed as the first Margrave of Flanders by King Charles II. It was a military appointment, responsible for repelling the Viking raids from the coast of Francia. The title of margrave (or marquis) evolved into that of count. Arnulf I was the first to name himself as count, by the Grace of God. The title of margrave largely fell out of use by the 12th century. Since then, the rulers of Flanders have only been referred to as counts. The counts of Flanders enlarged their estate through a series of diplomatic marriages. The counties of Hainaut, Namur, B√©thune, Nevers, Auxerre, Rethel, Burgundy, and Artois were all acquired in this manner. However, the County of Flanders suffered the same fate in turn. As a result of the marriage of Countess Margaret III with Philip II, Duke of Burgundy, the county and the subsidiary counties, entered a personal union with the Duchy of Burgundy in 1405. The counts of Flanders were also associated with the Duchy of Brittany prior to its union with France. In c 1323, Joan, the daughter of Arthur II, Duke of Brittany, married the second son of Count Robert III. Joanna of Flanders, the granddaughter of Count Robert III and daughter of his son, Count Louis I, married John Montfort. During Montfort's imprisonment, she fought on his behalf, alongside English allies, during the Breton War of Succession for the ducal crown, which was won definitively by her son John V, Duke of Brittany. It was through this alliance that the Duchy of Brittany was eventually joined to the throne of France.

As of 2010, MCDs exist in 29 states and the District of Columbia. In New York and New England, they are towns. In Puerto Rico the MCD is called a barrio or a barrio-pueblo. As of 1990, all or many of the MCDs in 20 states were general-purpose governmental units: Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Most of these MCDs are legally designated as towns or townships. The type of government may range from inoperative, to weak governmental authority, to incorporated municipalities. Since MCDs appear in a different category than incorporated places, this has caused some confusion in states where the MCDs have strong governments, such as in Michigan, the New England states, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. In states that do not have MCDs, mostly in the South and the West, the Census Bureau designates Census County Divisions (CCDs). In states that use MCDs, when any portion of the state is not covered by an MCD, the Census Bureau creates additional entities as unorganized territories, that it treats as equivalent to MCDs for statistical purposes. For several decennial censuses prior to the 2010 census, 28 states used MCDs, but in 2008, Tennessee changed from CCDs to MCDs, bringing the total number of MCD states to 29. In states that use MCDs and border a coast, territorial sea, or the Great Lakes, the Census Bureau assigns a default FIPS county subdivision code of 00000 and an ANSI code of eight zeroes to areas of water that are not legally included in a county subdivision.

Hugh Lupus Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster, (13 October 1825 ‚Äì 22 December 1899), styled Viscount Belgrave between 1831 and 1845 and Earl Grosvenor between 1845 and 1869 and known as The Marquess of Westminster between 1869 and 1874, was an English landowner, politician and racehorse owner. He inherited the estate of Eaton Hall in Cheshire and land in Mayfair and Belgravia, London, and spent much of his fortune in developing these properties. Although he was a member of parliament from the age of 22, and then a member of the House of Lords, his main interests were not in politics, but rather in his estates, in horse racing, and in country pursuits. He developed the stud at Eaton Hall and achieved success in racing his horses, winning the Derby on four occasions. Grosvenor also took an interest in a range of charities. At his death he was considered to be the richest man in Britain. Personal life Hugh Lupus Grosvenor was the second and eldest surviving son of Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster and Lady Elizabeth Leveson-Gower, the younger daughter of George Leveson-Gower, the 2nd Marquess of Stafford and later the 1st Duke of Sutherland. He was educated at Eton College and, until 1847, at Balliol College, Oxford. He left Oxford without taking a degree to become Member of Parliament (MP) for Chester. This seat had been held by his uncle, Robert Grosvenor (later the 1st Baron Ebury), who decided to move to one of the two unopposed Middlesex seats. In 1851 he toured India and Ceylon. The following year, on 28 April, he married his first cousin, Lady Constance Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, the fourth daughter of the 2nd Duke of Sutherland; at the time of the wedding she was aged 17. The wedding was held in the Chapel Royal in St. James's Palace, London, and was attended by Queen Victoria and Albert. Constance's mother had been Mistress of the Robes to Queen Victoria and a \\"favourite\\" of the queen. Their first child, a son, was born in 1853, and Queen Victoria became his godmother. By 1874 the couple had eleven children, eight of whom survived into adulthood; five sons and three daughters.Thompson, F. M. L., (2004) (online edition 2006) 'Grosvenor, Hugh Lupus, first duke of Westminster (1825‚Äì1899)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Retrieved on 26 April 2010. In 1880 Constance died from Bright's disease (nephritis). Two years later, in June 1882, Grosvenor married Katherine Cavendish, the third daughter of the 2nd Baron Chesham and Henrietta Frances Lascelles, who was then aged 24; she was younger than the duke's eldest son and two of his daughters. They had four children, two sons and two daughters. Political and public life Carlo Pellegrini in Vanity Fair, 1870 Grosvenor was elected as Whig MP for Chester in 1847 and continued to represent that constituency until, on the death of his father in 1869, he succeeded as 3rd Marquess of Westminster and entered the House of Lords. His maiden speech in the Commons was made in 1851 in a debate on disorders in Ceylon, shortly following his tour of the country. Otherwise he took little interest in the affairs of the House of Commons until 1866 when he expressed his opposition to Gladstone's Reform Bill. This played a part in Gladstone's resignation, the election of the Conservative Derby government and Disraeli's Second Reform Act. The relationship between Grosvenor and Gladstone later improved and in Gladstone's resignation honours in 1874, Grosvenor was created the 1st Duke of Westminster. When Gladstone became Prime Minister again in 1880, he appointed Grosvenor as Master of the Horse, a position appropriate to his interests in horse racing but \\"not an actively political office\\". In the 1880s Grosvenor disagreed with Gladstone again, this time about Home Rule for Ireland. During this dispute, Grosvenor sold his portrait of Gladstone that had been painted by Millais. Ten years later they were again reconciled when they both opposed atrocities by the Turks against the Armenians. When Gladstone died in 1898, Grosvenor presided over a Gladstone National Memorial committee that commissioned statues of him, and rebuilt Gladstone's St Deiniol's Library at Hawarden in north Wales. In 1860 Grosvenor formed the Queen's Westminster Rifle Volunteers and became its Lieutenant Colonel and Honorary Colonel in 1881.Army List, HMSO, 1892, He led the Cheshire Yeomanry as Colonel Commandant from 1869. He also supported charities; at one time or another, he was the president of five London hospitals, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association, the Gardeners' Royal Beneficent Association, the Hampstead Heath Protection Society, the Early Closing Association, the United Committee for the Demoralization of Native Races by the Liquor Traffic, and the Royal Agricultural Society. He was a member of the Council for the Promotion of Cremation; at that time cremation was unpopular with the Church. Grosvenor was chairman of the Queen's Jubilee Nursing Fund, an organisation that provided district nurses for the sick poor, through which he became associated with Florence Nightingale. In 1883 he was appointed as Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire, and when the London County Council was created in 1888, he became the first Lord Lieutenant of the County of London. Development of the estates Eaton Hall as designed by Alfred Waterhouse St Mary's Church, Eccleston as designed by G. F. Bodley The seat of the Grosvenor country estate is at Eaton Hall in Cheshire. When Grosvenor inherited the estate it was worth at least ¬£152,000 (equivalent to ¬£ as of ), a year. After inheriting the estate, one of his first acts was to commission a statue of his namesake, the Norman Hugh Lupus, who had been the 1st Earl of Chester, from G. F. Watts, to stand in the forecourt of the hall. In 1870 Grosvenor commissioned Alfred Waterhouse to design a new house to replace the previous hall designed by William Porden and extended by William Burn. The core of the previous hall was retained, parts were completely rebuilt and other parts were refaced and remodelled. A private wing was built as a residence for the family, and this was connected to the main hall by a corridor. Waterhouse also designed Eaton Chapel and its associated clocktower, and redesigned the stables. It is said that the hall's guests \\"were not greatly amused\\" by the carillon of 28 bells that played 28 tunes and sounded every quarter of the hour during the day and the night. The work took 12 years to complete and it cost ¬£803,000 (equivalent to ¬£ as of ). The hall has been described as \\"the most ambitious instance of Gothic Revival domestic architecture anywhere in the country\\", and as \\"a vast, cheerless, Gothic structure\\". Grosvenor in about 1878 Grosvenor paid for many buildings on his estates. He was a patron of the Chester architect John Douglas. Douglas' biographer, Edward Hubbard, estimated that the duke commissioned four churches and chapels, eight large houses, about 15 schools and institutions, about 50 farms (in whole or part), about 300 cottages, lodges, smithies and the like, two cheese factories, two inns, and about 12 commercial buildings (for most of which Douglas was the architect) ‚Äì and these were just the buildings in the city of Chester and on the Eaton estate. He commissioned G. F. Bodley to rebuild St Mary's Church in his Cheshire estate village of Eccleston, which was completed in 1899, the year of his death. He also spent money on Grosvenor House in London and Cliveden in Buckinghamshire, which he had inherited on the death of his mother-in-law. He built shooting lodges on sporting estates in Sutherland, in Scotland, that he rented from his cousin, the Duke of Sutherland. The Grosvenor wealth came mainly from the ground rents of Mayfair and Belgravia in London; these grew from about ¬£115,000 (equivalent to ¬£ as of ) in 1870 to about ¬£250,000 (equivalent to ¬£ as of ) annually in 1899. He oversaw much rebuilding in Mayfair and commissioned architects, such as Norman Shaw, Aston Webb and Alfred Waterhouse to design new buildings. He held his own opinions on architectural styles and decoration, favouring the Queen Anne style rather than the Italianate stucco preferred by his father; for red brick and terracotta; for stucco to be painted bright orange, and railings in chocolate or red; and for Oxford Street to be paved with wooden blocks. He opposed the use of telegraph poles and wires, and would not allow any building work during the London season. He encouraged the provision of more urinals, both on his estates and in London generally, and has been described as a \\"one-man planning and enforcement officer\\". Personality and personal interests Orme by Holland Tringham, trained by John Porter at Kingsclere. (Illustrated London News, May 1892). Grosvenor's major interest was in horse racing. In 1875, he established a racing stable at Eaton, eventually employing 30 grooms and boys, with two or three stallions and about 20 breeding mares. He regarded this, not so much as an extravagance, but rather as an aristocratic duty. He never gambled or placed a bet on any of his horses. In 1880, one of his horses, Bend Or, ridden by Fred Archer, won the Derby, and he had more Derby successes in 1882, 1886, and 1899. With his successes and sale of horses, it is considered possible that this enterprise was self-financing. Grosvenor took an interest in the country pursuits of deer stalking and shooting, both in the Scottish Highlands and on his Cheshire estate and added to the family's art collection. Grosvenor was teetotal and a supporter of temperance. In his Mayfair estate he reduced the number of public houses and beerhouses from 47 to eight. Final year and death In 1899, the last year of his life, he supported the Seats for Shop Assistants Act (to reduce cruelty to women employees), stalked a stag in Scotland, shot 65 snipe in 1¬Ω hours in Aldford on his Cheshire estate, and attended the wedding of one of his granddaughters. Later that year, while visiting the same granddaughter in Cranborne, Dorset, he developed bronchitis, from which he died. He was cremated in Woking Crematorium and his ashes were buried in the churchyard of Eccleston Church, Cheshire. The 1st Duke of Westminster had two cenotaphs erected in his honour, one in the Grosvenor Chapel of Eccleston Church and another in the south transept of Chester Cathedral. Another memorial was a stained-glass window in the south transept of Westminster Abbey, dedicated by the Dean in September 1902. He was succeeded as Duke of Westminster by his grandson, Hugh. At his death he was \\"reputedly the wealthiest man in Britain\\"; his estate for the purposes of probate was ¬£594,229 (equivalent to ¬£ million as of ), and his real estate (entailed therefore not included in his personal estate under the law of that time) was valued at about ¬£6,000,000 (equivalent to ¬£ million as of ),.

His military career began serving briefly in the regular British Army before transferring to serve with the Presidency armies of India. As a temporary brigadier-general he was responsible for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar (in the province of Punjab). He has been called \\"the Butcher of Amritsar\\",Nigel Collett, The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer, Kolkata, 2005 because of his order to fire on a peaceful crowd. The official report stated that this resulted in the killing of at least 379 people and the injuring of over a thousand more.Ferdinand Mount, \\"They would have laughed\\", in London Review of Books dated 4 April 2019, Vol. 41, No.7, pp 9-12 Some submissions to the official inquiry suggested a higher number of deaths. Subsequently Dyer was removed from duty and widely condemned both in Britain and India, but he became a celebrated hero among some with connections to the British Raj.Derek Sayer, \\"British Reaction to the Amritsar Massacre 1919‚Äì1920,\\" Past & Present, May 1991, Issue 131, pp 130‚Äì164 Some historians argue the episode was a decisive step towards the end of British rule in India. Early life Delhi Durbar of 1903 Dyer was born in Murree, in the Punjab province of British India, which is now in Pakistan. He was the son of Edward Dyer, a brewer who managed the Murree Brewery, and Mary Passmore.Oxford History of the British Empire Companion Series Ireland and the British Empire Kenny, Kevin 2004 Oxford University Press page 90 He spent his childhood in Murree and Shimla and received his early education at the Lawrence College Ghora Gali, Murree and Bishop Cotton School in Shimla. From eleven he attended Midleton College in County Cork, Ireland,Colvin, p. 9 before briefly studying medicine, at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, before deciding on a military career. Assignments In 1885, soon after graduating from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Dyer was commissioned into the Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) as a lieutenant, and performed riot control duties in Belfast (1886) and served in the Third Burmese War (1886‚Äì87). He transferred to the Bengal Army, initially joining the Bengal Staff Corps as a lieutenant in 1887. He was attached to the 39th Bengal Infantry, later transferring to the 29th Punjabis. He married Frances Annie Ommaney, the daughter of Edmund Piper Ommaney, on 4 April 1888, in St Martin's Church, Jhansi, India. The first of their three children, Gladys, was born in Shimla, India, in 1889. Dyer served in the latter in the Black Mountain campaign (1888), the Chitral Relief (1895) (promoted to captain in 1896) and the Mahsud blockade (1901‚Äì02). In 1901 he was appointed a deputy assistant adjutant general. In August 1903 Dyer was promoted to major, and served with the Landi Kotal Expedition (1908). He commanded the 25th Punjabis in India and Hong Kong and was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in 1910. During the First World War (1914‚Äì18), he commanded the Seistan Force, for which he was mentioned in dispatches and made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). He was promoted colonel in 1915, and was promoted to temporary brigadier general in 1916. In 1919, about a month after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, Dyer served in the Third Anglo-Afghan War. His brigade relieved the garrison of Thal, for which he was again mentioned in dispatches. For a few months in 1919 he was posted to the 5th Brigade at Jamrud.Colvin, p. 231 He retired on 17 July 1920, retaining the rank of colonel. Background In 1919, the European population in Punjab feared the locals would overthrow British rule. A nationwide hartal (strike action), which was called on 30 March (later changed to 6 April) by Mahatma Gandhi, had turned violent in some areas. Authorities were also becoming concerned by displays of Hindu-Muslim unity.Chadha, Yogesh (1997). Gandhi: A Life John Wiley & Sons Inc. Sir Michael O'Dwyer, the Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab, decided to deport major agitators from the province. One of those targeted was Dr. Satyapal, a Hindu who had served with the Royal Army Medical Corps during the First World War. He advocated non-violent civil disobedience and was forbidden by the authorities to speak publicly. Another agitator was Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew, a Muslim barrister who wanted political change and also preached non-violence. The district magistrate, acting on orders from the Punjab government, had the two leaders arrested. The shooting of protesters resulted in a mob forming and returning to the city centre of Amritsar, setting fire to government buildings and attacking Europeans in the city. Three British bank employees were beaten to death, and Miss Marcella Sherwood, who supervised the Mission Day School for Girls, was cycling around the city to close her schools when she was assaulted by a mob in a narrow street called the Kucha Kurrichhan. Sherwood was rescued from the mob by locals. They hid the teacher, who was hurt in the beating, before moving her to the fort. Dyer, who was the commandant of the infantry brigade in Jalandhar, decided to take action. He arrived on 11 April to assume command.Colvin, p. 162 Though authorities initially claimed that the massacre was triggered by the assault on Sherwood, regimental diaries reveal that this was merely a pretext. Instead, Dyer and O'Dwyer feared an imminent mutiny in Punjab similar to the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Amritsar massacre Dyer is infamous for the orders that he gave on 13 April 1919 in Amritsar. It was by his command that 50 troops, including 25 Gurkhas of 1/9 Gurkha Rifles (1st battalion, 9th Gurkha Rifles), 25 Pathans and Baluch, 54th Sikhs and 59th Sindh Rifles, all armed with .303 Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifles, opened fire on a non-violent gathering of unarmed civilians, men, women and children, at the Jallianwalla Bagh, in what later came to be known as the Amritsar massacre.Colvin, p. 178 The civilians had assembled at Jallianwala Bagh to participate in the annual Baisakhi celebrations which are both a religious and a cultural festival of the Punjabis. Coming from outside the city, they may have been unaware of the martial law that had been imposed. The Bagh-space comprised and was walled on all sides, except for five entrances. Four of the entrances were very narrow, admitting only a few people at a time. The fifth entrance was blocked by the armed soldiers, as well as by two armoured cars with machine guns. The vehicles were unable to pass through the entrance. Upon entering the park, the general ordered the troops to shoot directly into the gathering. The shooting continued unabated for about 10 minutes,Disorder Inquiry Committee Report, Vol II, p 191. and the soldiers' supply of 1,650 rounds of ammunition was almost exhausted.Report of Commissioners, Vol I, II, Bombay, 1920, Reprint New Delhi, 1976, p 56. Dyer is reported to have, from time to time, \\"checked his fire and directed it upon places where the crowd was thickest\\", not because the crowd was slow to disperse, but because he \\"had made up his mind to punish them for having assembled there.\\" Some of the soldiers initially shot into the air, at which Dyer shouted: \\"Fire low. What have you been brought here for?\\"Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, A Premeditated Plan, Punjab University Chandigarh, 1969, p 89, Raja Ram; A Saga of Freedom Movement and Jallianwala Bagh, Udham Singh, 2002, p 141, Prof (Dr) Sikander Singh. Later, Dyer's own testimony revealed that the crowd was not given any warning to disperse and he was not remorseful for having ordered his troops to shoot.See: Report of Commissioners, Vol I, II, Bombay, 1920, Reprint New Delhi, 1976, p 55-56. The Hunter Commission report on the incident, published the following year by the Government of India, criticised both Dyer, and the Government of the Punjab for failing to compile a casualty count, so quoted a figure offered by the Sewa Samati (A Social Services Society) of 379 identified dead, comprising 337 men, 41 boys and a six-week old baby, with approximately 1,100 wounded, of which 192 were seriously injured. However other estimates,Home Political, 23 Sept 1921, No 23, National Archive of India, New Delhi from government civil servants in the city (commissioned by the Punjab Sub-committee of Indian National Congress),Report of Commissioners, appointed by the Punjab Sub- committee of Indian National Congress, Vol I, New Delhi, p 68 as well as counts from the Home Political, cite numbers of well over a thousand dead. According to a Home Political Deposit report, the number was more than 1,000, with more than 1,200 wounded. Dr Smith, a British civil surgeon at Amritsar, estimated that there were over 1,800 casualties.Report of Commissioners, Vol I, New Delhi, p 105 In India, the deliberate infliction of these casualties earned Dyer the epithet of the \\"Butcher of Amritsar\\". Threatening language The day after the massacre Kitchin, the Commissioner of Lahore as well as Dyer, both used threatening language. The following is the English translation of Dyer's Urdu statement directed at the local residents of Amritsar on the afternoon of 14 April 1919, a day after the Amritsar massacre: Crawling order Dyer designated the spot where Marcella Sherwood was assaulted as sacred. Daytime pickets were placed at either end of the street. Anyone wishing to proceed in the street between 6am and 8pm was made to crawl the on all fours, lying flat on their bellies.\\"Some Indians crawl face downwards in front of their gods. I wanted them to know that a British woman is as sacred as a Hindu god and therefore, they have to crawl in front of her too\\" The order was not required at night due to a curfew. The order effectively closed the street. The houses did not have any back doors and the inhabitants could not go out without climbing down from their roofs. This order was in effect from 19 April until 25 April 1919.Colvin, p. 197 Reaction in Britain and British India A Committee of enquiry, chaired by Lord Hunter, was established to investigate the massacre. The committee's report criticised Dyer, arguing that in \\"continuing firing as long as he did, it appears to us that Colonel Dyer committed a grave error.\\" Dissenting members argued that the martial law regime's use of force was wholly unjustified. \\"Colonel Dyer thought he had crushed the rebellion and Sir Michael O'Dwyer was of the same view,\\" they wrote, \\"(but) there was no rebellion which required to be crushed.\\"Colvin, p. 273 Dyer was met by the Adjutant-General of India, Lieutenant-General Sir Havelock Hudson, who told him that he was relieved of his command. He was told later by the Commander-in-Chief in India, General Sir Charles Monro, to resign his post and that he would not be reemployed.Mariners, Merchants and the Military Too By Phillip E Jones Dyer tried to win over the Sikhs as best as he could. He forced the manager of the Golden Temple, and Sunder Singh Majithia, to use their influence over the Sikhs, in favour of the government. As a result, priests of the Golden Temple invited him to the sacred shrine and presented him with a Siropa (turban and sword). Rudyard Kipling, who claimed Dyer was \\"the man who saved India\\", is alleged to have started a benefit fund which raised over ¬£26,000 sterling, including ¬£50 for Dyer contributed by Kipling himself. However, Subhash Chopra, in his book Kipling Sahib ‚Äì the Raj Patriot (2006), writes that the benefit fund was started by the Morning Post newspaper and not by Kipling and that Kipling made no contribution to the Dyer fund. Dyer was heavily criticised both in Britain and India. Several senior and influential British government officials and Indians spoke out against him, including: *Pandit Motilal Nehru, father of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, who called the massacre the \\"saddest and most revealing of all\\".Valentine Chitol, India Old and New, London, 1921, p 312 *Rabindranath Tagore, the first Asian Nobel Laureate and distinguished Indian educator, who renounced his knighthood in protest against the massacre and said, \\"a great crime has been done in the name of law in the Punjab\\".Tribune, Lahore, 16 April 1919, see Government of India, Home Department, Political Deposit, August 1919, No 52, National Archives of India, New Delhi. *Sir Shankaran Nair, who resigned his membership of the Viceroy's Executive Council in the Legislative Council of Punjab in protest at the massacre.Punjab Legislative Council Proceedings, 23 Feb 1921, Vol I I. *Punjab Legislative Council members Nawab Din Murad and Kartar Singh, who described the massacre as \\"neither just nor humane.\\" *Charles Freer Andrews, an Anglican priest and friend of Gandhi, who termed the Jallianwala Bagh massacre as a \\"cold-blooded massacre and inhumane.\\"Home Political, K. W., A, 20 June 1920, Nos 126‚Äì194, National Archives of India, New Delhi. *Brigadier-General Surtees, who stated in the Dyer debate that \\"we hold India by force ‚Äì undoubtedly by force\\".Arthur Swinson, Six Minutes of Sunset, London, 1964, p 210; cited in Psycho-Political compulsions of Jallinawala Bagh by Gurcaharan Singh, op cit, p 156. *Edwin Samuel Montagu, the Secretary of State for India, who called it \\"a grave error in judgement\\". In a debate in the House of Commons, he asked, \\"Are you going to keep your hold on India by terrorism, racial humiliation, subordination and frightfulness, or are you going to rest it upon the goodwill and the growing goodwill of the people of your Indian Empire?\\" *Winston Churchill, at the time Britain's Secretary of State for War, who called the massacre \\"an episode without precedent or parallel in the modern history of the British Empire‚Ä¶ an extraordinary event, a monstrous event, an event which stands in singular and sinister isolation... the crowd was neither armed nor attacking\\" during a debate in the House of Commons. In a letter to the leader of the Liberals and former Secretary of State for India, the Marquess of Crewe, he wrote, \\"My own opinion is that the offence amounted to murder, or alternatively manslaughter.\\" *Former Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party H. H. Asquith, who observed: \\"There has never been such an incident in the whole annals of Anglo-Indian history, nor, I believe, in the history of our empire since its very inception down to present day. It is one of the worst outrages in the whole of our history.\\"Hansard, 5th sec. Commons, quoted by Derek Sayer, British Commemoration of Amritsar Volume, Patiala, 1997, p 24. *B. G. Horniman, who observed: \\"No event within living memory, probably, has made so deep and painful impression on the mind of the public in this country [Britain] as what came to be known as the Amritsar massacre.\\"Amritsar and Our Duty to India, London, 1920, B. G. Horniman, p 7. The era of O'Dwyer and Dyer has been deemed \\"an era of misdeeds of British administration in India\\".Government of India, External affairs Department, File No 1940, Newspapers (Secret), p 2 During the Dyer debates in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, there was both praise and condemnation of Dyer.Army Council and Colonel Dyer Hansard, 8 July 1920 In 1920, the British Labour Party Conference at Scarborough unanimously passed a resolution denouncing the Amritsar massacre as a \\"cruel and barbarous action\\" of British officers in Punjab, and called for their trial, the recall of Sir Michael O'Dwyer and the Viceroy, Lord Chelmsford, and the repealing of repressive legislation.The Times, London, 25 June 1920, cited in Sayer, British Reaction of Amritsar massacre, 1919‚Äì20, Reprint in Jallianwala Bagh Commemoration Volume, Patiala, 1997, p 41 Settlement in Britain Churchill, the then Secretary of State for War, wanted Dyer to be disciplined, but the Army Council superseded by him decided to allow Dyer to resign with no plan for further punishment. Following Churchill's speech defending the council's decision and a debate in Parliament, on 8 July 1920 MPs voted for the government by a majority of 247 to 37; a motion calling for approval of Dyer's actions was defeated by a majority of 230 to 129. Having been born in India and educated in Ireland, Dyer then settled in Britain. He was presented with a gift of ¬£26,000 sterling, a huge sum in those days, , which emerged from the fund raised on his behalf by the Morning Post, a conservative, pro-imperialist newspaper which later merged with the Daily Telegraph. A \\"Thirteen Women Committee\\" was constituted to present \\"the Saviour of the Punjab with the sword of honour and a purse\\". Large contributions to the fund were made by civil servants and by British Army and Indian Army officers, although serving members of the military were not allowed to donate to political funds under the King's Regulations (para. 443). The Morning Post had supported Dyer's action on the grounds that the massacre was necessary to \\"Protect the honour of European Women\\".Morning Post, cited in Derek Sayer, British Reaction of Amritsar massacre, 1919‚Äì20, reprinted in Jallianwala Bagh Commemoration Volume, Patiala, 1997, p 45. Many Indians, including Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore, were outraged by the fund for Dyer, particularly due to the families of the victims killed at the Jallianwala Bagh, who were still fighting for government compensation. In the end, they received Rs 500 (then equal to ¬£37.10s.0d; ) for each victim. Dyer acquired a farm at Ashton Fields, Ashton Keynes, Wiltshire, which was still given as his address when he died,\\"DYER C. B. Reginald Edward Harry of Ashton Fields Ashton Keynes Wiltshire died 23 July 1927 at St Martin's Long Ashton near Bristol\\" in Probate Index for 1927 at probatesearch.service.gov.uk, accessed 17 April 2019 although in 1925 he had bought a small cottage at Long Ashton on the outskirts of Bristol and spent his last two years there, while one of his sons lived at the farm.Swagata Ghosh, The last days of Reginald Dyer dated 10 April 2016 in the Deccan Chronicle online, accessed 17 April 2019 Dyer's response and motivation Dyer made three conflicting sets of statements about his motives and actions. At first, immediately after he carried out the massacre, he made a series of partial but slightly varying explanations with the aim of exonerating himself from any blame. Later, after receiving approval for his actions from all his superiors in India, both civil and military, Dyer stated that his actions were a deliberate attempt to punish people he believed were rebels, and to make an example for the rest of the Punjab that would stop what he regarded as a rebellion. Finally, on Dyer's return to England in disgrace in 1920, his lawyers argued that his actions, though deliberate and premeditated, were justified because he was facing an insurrection and that, on those grounds, any amount of firing was permissible. Dyer wrote an article in the Globe of 21 January 1921, entitled, \\"The Peril to the Empire\\". It commenced with \\"India does not want self-government. She does not understand it.\\" He wrote later that: *It is only to an enlightened people that free speech and a free press can be extended. The Indian people want no such enlightenment. *There should be an eleventh commandment in India, \\"Thou shalt not agitate\\". *The time will come to India when a strong hand will be exerted against malice and 'perversion' of good order. *Gandhi will not lead India to capable self- government. The British Raj must continue, firm and unshaken in its administration of justice to all men. In his official response to the Hunter commission that inquired into the shooting, Dyer was unremorseful and stated: \\"I think it quite possible that I could have dispersed the crowd without firing but they would have come back again and laughed, and I would have made, what I consider, a fool of myself.\\" However, in his account of the massacre Nick Lloyd claims that although Dyer later claimed to have undertaken the massacre to \\"save\\" British India, he had had no such idea in his mind that fateful afternoon. As well as being \\"dazed and shaken up\\" ‚Äì hardly the response of a soldier who had had murder in his mind ‚Äì all the witnesses recall how Dyer \\"was unnerved and deeply upset about what had happened\\". Nigel Collett - author of the biography The Butcher of Amritsar - is convinced that the Amritsar massacre preyed on Dyer's mind from the very day he opened fire. \\"He spent the rest of his life trying to justify himself. He persuaded himself it had been his duty to act as he did, but he could not persuade his soul that he had done right. It rotted his mind and, I am guessing here, added to his sickness.\\" Collett, in his book, portrays Dyer as a man who got on extremely well with his men and his juniors, while his contemporaries and seniors were always wary of him. When he approached a complex political problem, his one thought was to have order; his one tool to get it was the gun. He notes that, at the time of the Amritsar massacre, Dyer was wracked by ill-health and separated from his beloved family. Collett speculates that perhaps this encouraged Dyer's extreme view that the Punjab was on the brink of rebellion, with the empire about to collapse, and feared a mutiny like that of 1857. The solution, he decided, was not just to restore order but to show that the state was in charge. It was not enough to have shops and businesses reopen in Amritsar - an example was needed of the consequences of insubordination. Collett quotes Dyer himself on the motivations that drove him to act as he did: \\"...It was no longer a question of merely dispersing the crowd but one of producing a sufficient moral effect, from a military point of view, not only on those who were present but more specially throughout the Punjab. There could be no question of undue severity. The mutineers had thrown out the challenge and the punishment, if administered at all, must be complete, unhesitating and immediate.\\" Death Dyer suffered a series of strokes during the last years of his life and he became increasingly isolated due to the paralysis and speechlessness inflicted by his strokes. He died of cerebral haemorrhage and arteriosclerosis on 23 July 1927. On his deathbed, Dyer reportedly said: The Morning Post remembered him in an article titled \\"The Man Who Saved India\\" and \\"He Did His Duty\\" but the (Liberal) Westminster Gazette wrote a contrary opinion: \\"No British action, during the whole course of our history in India, has struck a severer blow to Indian faith in British justice than the massacre at Amritsar.\\"Collett, p. 431 Historian Gordon Johnson commented that \\"...Dyer's actions ran counter to Army regulations. These required that force should be constrained by what was reasonable to achieve an immediate objective; minimum, not maximum, force should be deployed. Moreover, proper warning had to be given. On 13 April 1919, as demonstrated by Collett, Dyer ignored this. While he may have believed the Raj was threatened, and may have thought the mob was out to attack him and his soldiers, this does not justify his cavalier abuse of procedure and his indifference to Indian suffering. In so behaving, he brought not only death to the innocent but also destroyed himself and undermined the empire in which he took so much pride.\\" Although still owning property in Wiltshire, Dyer died at his cottage in Somerset, St Martin's, Long Ashton, near Bristol. He left an estate valued at ¬£11,941, . Popular culture Dyer is played by Edward Fox in the 1982 film Gandhi. A fictionalised account of Dyer's actions in Amritsar is contained in the 1981 Booker Prize winning novel Midnight's Children, by author Salman Rushdie (see List of Midnight's Children characters).Mullan, John. \\"Salman Rushdie on the writing of Midnight's Children.\\" Guardian. 26 July 2008.

Sometime near August 19, 2005, AOL discontinued support for the protocol and no longer uses it in any of the instant messaging clients it actively maintains, such as its Windows and Mac clients for the AOL Instant Messenger and ICQ systems. However, it once did produce several of its own TOC clients, including TiK and TAC which are written in Tcl/Tk, TNT which is written in Emacs Lisp, all of which are open source, and a Java client originally called TIC which later became the Quick Buddy web applet. AOL also provided the TOC protocol specification openly to developers in the hopes that they will use it instead of the proprietary OSCAR protocol they use themselves. In July 2012, AOL turned off the TOC2 servers and it is no longer possible to connect to AIM using this protocol.http://monal.im/blog/possible- end-of-aim-support/ TOC was an ASCII-based protocol, while OSCAR is a binary protocol. In addition, TOC contained fewer features than its OSCAR counterpart. OSCAR provides such functionality as buddy icons, file transfer, and advertising.  How it works  TOC acted as a wrapper for the OSCAR protocol. In the grand scheme of things, the TOC server was nothing but an OSCAR client that happened to listen on a socket, translating messages between the two protocols. Upon login, the TOC client specified an OSCAR login server (presumably either \`login.oscar.aol.com\` or \`login.icq.com\`) that the TOC server used on behalf of the client. TOC used FLAP to encapsulate its messages just as OSCAR does, however, FLAP has been hacked in such a way that it can be implemented on the same port as an HTTP server. By default, the TOC server operated in HTTP mode, indistinguishable from a typical web server. If a connecting client, in place of an HTTP request, writes the string \\"\`FLAPON\`\\" followed by two CRLFs, TOC would switch gears and start reading FLAP messages. Upon getting a user's profile, the client was expected to re-connect to TOC and use it as an HTTP server, which would host the user's profile in HTML. Once connected, two basic message formats for communications inside of FLAP existed. Client-to-server messages were sent in a format resembling a Unix- style command line: commands with whitespace-separated arguments, quoting and backslash escape sequences. Server-to-client messages were much simpler: they were sent as colon-separated ASCII strings, in a manner similar to many Unix config files. Thus, it was quite easy to write a client, as the incoming messages were very easy to parse, and outgoing commands were easy to generate. This is in contrast to OSCAR, which due to the binary representation of data can be more difficult to understand.  TOC2  The TOC2 protocol is an updated version of the TOC protocol, or \\"Talk to OSCAR\\" protocol. Its existence was never documented by AOL and it is only used in a few AOL Instant Messenger clients. Some clients are beginning to offer plugins for TOC2 in light of AOL's recent shutdown of their TOC servers. Like its predecessor, TOC2 is an ASCII protocol and lacks some features of OSCAR, but unlike TOC, TOC2 is known to support buddy icons and receiving file transfers (not sending). TOC2 operates in essentially the same way as TOC, as a wrapper for OSCAR. Porting code from TOC to TOC2 is remarkably easy as well. Because of the similarities between TOC1.0 and TOC2.0, they are better defined by their differences, of which there are only a few: * In TOC1.0, connecting with an empty buddy list would make it so that others are not able to see you online. This has been corrected in TOC2.0. * In TOC1.0, there is a toc_add_deny command, but no toc_remove_deny. TOC2.0 corrects this as well. * The sign on process is basically the same as TOC1.0, but with a few new parameters: version, a number, and a code created based on the username and password. The purpose of the number is unknown. The default is 160 and it seems to have no effect if changed. * Permitting and denying have been revamped and are much easier and full-featured in TOC2.0. The commands toc2_add_permit, toc2_remove_permit, toc2_add_deny, and toc2_remove_deny are all present and accessible at any time. * Buddy list commands have also been improved. Group management is easier with the toc2_new_group and toc2_del_group commands. Also, it is possible to add or remove more than one buddy at a time, and choose the groups they are in. * A few syntax changes have also been made, and parameters have been added to some commands.

King (February 21, 1891 ‚Äì March 31, 1971) was a United States march music bandmaster and composer. He is best known as the composer of \\"Barnum and Bailey's Favorite\\". Early life Karl Lawrence King was born in the village of Paintersville, Ohio. He was the only child of Sandusky S. and Anna Lindsey King. The King family moved to Canton, Ohio when he was eleven, the age he used newspaper carrier income to purchase his first musical instrument ‚Äì a cornet. He studied with Emile Reinkendorff, director of the Grand Army Band of Canton, on this instrument. He grew up as a self-taught musician with very little schooling of any kind (he left school after the eighth grade, age fourteen). His only music instruction included assistance from local musicians when he played brass instruments in the Canton Marine Band. He also had four piano lessons and one harmony lesson from musical show director William Bradford. He learned to compose by studying scores. He quit school to learn the printing trade (while composing music at night), but soon switched to playing in and composing for bands. His first professional positions were in the Thayer Military Band in Canton, directed by William E. Strassner followed by the Neddermeyer Band of Columbus, Ohio, conducted by Fred Neddermeyer. He switched from the cornet to the baritone horn, with Strassner instructing him on that instrument. He also played in the Soldier's Home Band in Danville, Illinois. Circus band trouping 1910‚Äì1918 In 1910 at the age of 19, he began a short career playing baritone in and directing circus bands. That year, he joined the Robinson Famous Shows under conductor Woodring Van Anda (\\"Woody Van\\"). The next year he was performing in the Yankee Robinson Circus band under Theo. Stout. In 1912, he performed in the Sells- Floto Circus under W.P. English (a famous march composer), and in 1913 in the Barnum and Bailey band under Ned Brill. At the request of Brill he wrote (and dedicated to Brill) \\"Barnum & Bailey's Favorite\\", his most famous march and possibly the most recognizable American music written specifically for the circus. It would soon be adopted as the theme of the circus. His first full- time conducting job was in 1914 through 1915 with the Sells Floto Circus and Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show combined shows band. He became bandmaster for the Sells-Floto Circus in 1915 and was bandmaster of the Barnum and Bailey Circus band 1917‚Äì1918. In his final band, he included his wife Ruth (Lovett) as the calliope performer. He had married Ruth November 17, 1916. In an interview in the last year of his life, King stated that his proudest moment was conducting the Barnum and Bailey band in Madison Square Garden. Life after circus bands Oleson Park Music Pavilion, Fort Dodge, Iowa, which King considered his home base. King hoped to join John Philip Sousa at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station during World War I. With no openings on his staff at the time, Sousa suggested King apply to the army as bandmaster at Camp Grant. The war ended on his reporting date so King did not serve on active duty. King remained in Canton as director of the local band. He began a music publishing business, the K.L. King Music House in 1919, the same year his only child Karl L. King, Jr. was born. The first publication of his new music company was \\"Broadway One-Step\\". After a year in Canton where he directed the Grand Army Band (1919) King settled down in Fort Dodge, Iowa. This was in 1920 (age 29) and for the next fifty-one years he conducted the Fort Dodge Municipal Band, which featured future American Bandmasters Association president Joseph Hermann on clarinet. The band became known as King's Band. King was instrumental in the passage of the Iowa Band Law in 1921, which allowed cities to levy a local tax for maintenance of a band. He commemorated this with one of his marches, \\"Iowa Band Law\\". In 1960, King would direct \\"Iowa Band Law\\" with the largest mass band ever assembled: 188 high school bands and nearly 13,000 musicians at a nationally televised University of Michigan football game. He was given a testimonial dinner for 250 people in 1951 at the age of 59 where band world luminaries including Glenn Cliffe Bainum, Albert Austin Harding, Paul V. Yoder, and William H. Santelmann attended (as well as William S. Beardsley, the governor of Iowa). Karl King died on March 31, 1971 of acute diverticulitis at age 80 in a Fort Dodge, Iowa hospital. He and his wife Ruth I. (Lovett) King (June 10, 1898 ‚Äì July 4, 1988) are buried at North Lawn Cemetery. Their only son Karl L. King, Jr. was born in 1919 and died November 19, 1987. A physical description of Karl King in the 1951 Who's Who in Music: brown eyes, brown hair, 6‚Äô1‚Äù in height, 200 pounds. Compositions King the composer published more than 300 works: galops, waltzes, overtures, serenades, rags, and 188 marches and screamers. It could be said that King did for the circus march what Sousa did for the patriotic march. He seemed to like composing under pressure and often composed in tight spots (such as by oil lamp in cramped circus tents). His name appeared on the sheet music as Karl King, K. L. King, and sometimes Carl Lawrence. His first known composition still extant was composed for the Thayer Military Band while he was performing it in ‚Äì titled \\"March T.M.B.\\" (1909). His first copyrighted work was \\"Moonlight on the Nile Waltz\\" (also 1909). King's marches for circus bands are usually composed at a high difficulty level (grade 4‚Äì5 typically) American march music. He also contributed greatly to the school band movement with numerous compositions at various levels of difficulty. \\"Barnum and Bailey's Favorite\\" (1913) remains his best-known composition, but other pieces that retain their popularity among fans of band music include: *\\"Aces of the Air\\" (1942) *\\"Allied Honor\\" (1955) *\\"Attorney General\\" (1921) *\\"The Big Cage\\" (1934) *\\"Big Four\\" (1955) *\\"Bolivar\\" (1918) *\\"Broadway One-Step\\" (1919) *\\"Bunker Hill\\" (1943) *\\"Burma Patrol\\" (1942) *\\"Carrollton\\" (1909) *\\"Circus Days\\" (1944) *\\"Cyrus The Great\\" (1921) *\\"The Desert Patrol\\" (1934) *\\"Diamond Jubilee March‚Äù (1961, a composite of seven of King‚Äôs most famous marches) *\\"Emblem of Freedom\\" (1910) *\\"Fidelity\\" (1912) *\\"Flying Cadets\\" (1942) *\\"Freedom City\\" (1955) *\\"Gallant Marines\\" (1942) *\\"Garland Entr√©e\\" (1912) *\\"General Lee\\" (1943) *\\"Glorious America\\" (1955) *\\"The Golden Dragon\\" (1917) *\\"Homestretch Gallop\\" (1912) *\\"Hosts of Freedom\\" (1920) *\\"Invictus\\" (1921) *‚ÄùIowa Band Law‚Äù (1921) *‚ÄùIowa Centennial March‚Äù (1946) *\\"Kentucky Sunrise\\" (1919) *\\"Liberty Fleet\\" (1942) *\\"Lt.

He was the son of king Gundobad and Caretene. He succeeded his father in 516. Sigismund and his brother Godomar were defeated in battle by Clovis' sons and Godomar fled. Sigismund was taken by Chlodomer, King of Orl√©ans, where he was kept as a prisoner. Later he, his wife and children were executed. Godomar then rallied the Burgundian army and won back his kingdom.  Life  Sigismund was a student of Avitus of Vienne, the Chalcedonian bishop of Vienne who converted Sigismund from the Arian faith of his Burgundian forebears.John Bagnell Bury, History of the Later Roman Empire: From the Death of Theodosius I to the death of Justianian, Vol. I, (Dover Publications, 1958), 463. Sigismund was inspired to found a monastery dedicated to Saint Maurice at Agaune in Valais in 515.Perennial Prayer at Agaune, Barbara H. Rosewein, Monks and Nuns, Saints and Outcasts, ed. Lester K. Little, Sharon A. Farmer and Barbara H Rosenwein, (Cornell University Press, 2000), 39‚Äì40. The following year he became king of the Burgundians. Sigismund's conflict with Bishop Apollinaris Sigismund came into conflict with Apollinaris of Valence over the rules regarding marriage. The king's treasurer, Stephen, was living in flagrant incest. The four bishops of the province ordered him to separate from his companion, but he appealed to Sigismund, who supported his official and exiled the four bishops to Sardinia. They refused to yield, and after some time the King relented, and permitted three of them to return to their Sees, with the exception of Apollinaris, whose defiance had made him particularly obnoxious to the King. He was kept a close prisoner for a year. At last the King, stricken with a severe illness, sent the Queen to request Apollinaris go to the court to restore the monarch to health. On his refusal, the Queen asked for his cloak to place on the sufferer. The request was granted, the King recovered, and Apollinaris was allowed to return to his See.Campbell, Thomas. \\"St. Apollinaris.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 1.

Murder of his son According to Gregory of Tours, Sigismund married the daughter of the Ostrogoth King Theodoric. They had a son, Sigeric. The widowed Sigismund later remarried, and his second wife \\"maltreated and insulted her stepson\\".Kasten, Brigitte. \\"Stepmothers in Frankish legal life\\", Law, Laity and Solidarities, (Susan Reynolds, ed.), Manchester University Press, 2001, When, on a feast day in 517, Sigeric saw his stepmother dressed in his late mother's ceremonial clothes, he called out that she was unworthy to wear them. (Under Burgundian law, his mother's clothes should have gone to his sister, Suavegotha.) The Queen persuaded Sigismund to deal with his son, alleging that Sigeric planned not only to kill his father and seize the throne, but that he also had designs on his grandfather's kingdom in Italy. Sigismund ordered the young man to be taken while drunk and drowned in a well. Then, overcome with remorse, Sigismund retreated to the monastery that he had founded. Burgundian War, defeat and death of Sigismund In 523, Clotilde, daughter of Chilperic II of Burgundy who had been slain by Sigismund's father Gundobad in 493, took revenge for the murder of her father, when she incited her sons against Sigismund, and provoked the Burgundian War, which led to Sigismund's deposition and imprisonment, and his assassination the following year. In 523, the Kingdom of the Burgundians was invaded by the four Frankish kings, Chlodomer, Childebert I, Clotaire I and Theuderic I, children of Frankish king Clovis I and Sigismund's first cousins once removed by Clotilde. Sigismund and his brother Godomar led the Burgundian defence but lost the battle. Godomar fled while Sigismund put on a monk's habit and hid in a cell near his abbey. He was captured by Chlodomer, king of Aurelianum (modern Orl√©ans), beheaded and his body thrown in a well.G√°bor Klaniczay, Holy Rulers and Blessed Princesses: Dynastic Cults in Medieval Central Europe, (Cambridge University Press, 2000), 67‚Äì68. Sigismund's wife and remaining children were also put to death. Aftermath Sigismund was succeeded on the throne by his brother Godomar. Godomar then rallied the Burgundian army and called for aid from his ally, the Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great.According to Herwig Wolfram, History of the Goths, in 494 Sigismund married Ostrogotha, the illegitimate daughter of Theoderic the Great and a concubine, as a part of Theoderic's negotiation for an alliance. Godomar regained his territory; the garrisons that the Franks had left behind were massacred. Chlodomer marched with his brother Theuderic I, King of Metz, on Burgundy in 524. Chlodomer was killed at the Battle of V√©zeronce, which took place on 25 June 524, reportedly at the hands of Godomar.  Veneration  In 535, Sigismund's remains were recovered from the well at Coulmiers and buried in the monastery at Agaune. Eventually Sigismund was canonized. Correspondence has survived between Sigismund and Avitus of Vienne, who was a poet and one of the last masters of the classical literary arts. In 1366, Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, transferred Sigismund's relics to Prague,Don C Skemer, Binding Words: Textual amulets in the Middle Ages, (Pennsylvania State University Press, 2006), 254. hence he has become a patron saint of the Kingdom of Bohemia, now Czech Republic. St Sigismund of Burgundy Retrieved on 6 Mar 2018Herma of Saint Sigismund in P≈ÇockThe emperor gave the saint's name to one of his sons, the later King Sigismund of Hungary (who also became decades later King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor). In 1424, Sigismund of Hungary constructed a church in the honor of Saint Sigismund in the City of Buda.Raphael Patai, The Jews of Hungary: History, Culture, Psychology, (Wayne State University Press, 1996), 74.

Description Vaccinium virgatum is a deciduous shrub growing to 3 to 6 feet tall and with up to a 3-foot spread. The leaves are spirally arranged, oblate to narrow elliptic, 3 inches long and start out red-bronze in the spring only to develop into a dark-green. The flowers are white, bell- shaped, 5 mm long. The fruit is a berry 5 mm diameter, dark blue to black, bloomed pale blue-gray by a thin wax coating. Pollination Vaccinium virgatum is self-infertile, and must have two or more varieties to pollenize each other. Honeybees are inefficient pollinators, and carpenter bees frequently cut the corollas to rob nectar without pollinating the flowers. V. virgatum does best when pollinated by buzz pollination by bees, such as the native southeastern blueberry bee, Habropoda laboriosa. Uses =Culinary= Berries of Vaccinium virgatum are edible and are used as sauces and syrups, and for breads, muffins, pancakes, and pies, and may have pain killing properties (antinociceptive effects).Maria Rosana Ramirez, Leandra Guterres, Odila E. Dickel, Micheli R. de Castro, Amelia T.

April 2010: 336-342 =Ornamental= Vaccinium virgatum is grown as an ornamental plant, especially for its fall colors, typically bright orange or red. Cultivation Vaccinium virgatum grows best on acid soil and is subject to few pests and diseases. Because it is not self-fruitful, two compatible varieties should be planted next to each other to maintain fruiting. If maintained with mulching, it may endure temperatures as low as 10 degrees Fahrenheit. The plants mature to heights from 3 to 6 feet, with a width of up to 3 feet. The plant has few insect or disease problems, however birds and squirrels consume its fruit.

The dance is rooted through the rhythms of live funk music, and is based on the technique of Boogaloo's posing approach, quickly contracting and relaxing muscles to cause a jerk or can be a sudden stop in the dancer's body, referred to as a pose, pop or a hit.Fuhrer, M.

It was popularized by a Fresno & Long Beach-based dance group called the Electric Boogaloos that mixed popping techniques to boogaloo. Closely related illusory dance styles and techniques are often integrated into popping to create a more varied performance. These dance styles include the robot, waving and tutting. However, popping is distinct from breaking and locking, with which it is often confused. A popping dancer is commonly referred to as a popper. Because of Popping's cultural Boogaloo roots, Popping developed before Hiphop's cultural movement and help influence the tradition of styles of hip hop dancing.Guzman- Sanchez, T. (2012) Underground Dance Masters: Final History of a Forgotten Era. PraegerMartel, D. 1992 \\"Wrecking Shop (Live in Brooklyn) It is often performed in battles, where participants try to outperform each other in front of a crowd, giving room for improvisation and freestyle moves that are seldom seen in shows and performances, such as interaction with other dancers and spectators. Popping and related styles such as waving and tutting have also been incorporated into the electronica dance scene to some extent, influencing new styles such as liquid and digits and turfing. Terminology As stated earlier, popping has become the latest umbrella term for a group of closely related styles and techniques rooted in the Boogaloo tradition that have often been combined, evolved or danced together with popping, some of which are seldom seen outside of popping contexts.The popping category generally centers around the technique of popping, but much variation involving closely related styles is allowed. Characteristics Popping is centered around the technique of popping, which means to quickly contract and relax muscles to create a jerking effect (a pop or hit) in the body. It is also known as Posing Hard from the Boogaloo tradition, this technique was innovated by the Boogaloo group, the Black Messengers from Oakland. Popping can be concentrated to specific body parts, creating variants such as arm pops, leg pops, chest pops and neck pops. Music Having its roots in the late 1970s funk era, popping is commonly danced to funk and disco music. Popular artists include Zapp, Dayton, Dazz Band and Cameo. During the 1980s, many poppers also utilized electro music, with artists such as Kraftwerk, Yellow Magic Orchestra, Egyptian Lover and World Class Wrecking Crew. More mainstream hip hop music was also employed by poppers during the 1980s, including Afrika Bambaataa, Kurtis Blow, Whodini and Run DMC. Today, it is common to see popping danced to more current music genres such as modern hip hop (often abstract/instrumental hip hop) and various forms of electronic dance music such as dubstep. Songs that are generally favored have a straight and steady beat at around 90-120 beats per minute, a 4/4 time signature and a strong emphasis on the back beat, normally by a snare drum or a drum machine. The pops performed by the popper normally occur on every beat or on the distinct back beats. The popper can also choose to follow the music more freely such as by timing the pops to the rhythm of a melody or other rhythmic elements.  Variations  backslide or \\"moonwalk\\", a common move in the floating style often seen combined with popping. ; Animation : A style and a technique where the dancer imitates film characters being animated by stop motion. The technique of moving rigidly and jerky by tensing muscles and using techniques similar to strobing and the robot makes it appear as if the dancer has been animated frame by frame. Walt Disney was the first to use this term, referring to his character Steam Boat Willie‚Äôs motions as ‚Äúthe animation dance‚Äù in 1929. This style was heavily inspired by the dynamation films created by Ray Harryhausen, such as The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad (1958). ; Boogaloo : Boogaloo or \\"bug'n\\" is an older umbrella name of funk dances originating in Oakland, California. It can be described as a free-form dance style with loose movements trying to give the impression of a body lacking bones, partly inspired by animated movies and cartoons. It utilizes circular rolls of various body parts, such as the hips, chest, shoulders, knees and head - this technique is also referred to as \\"wormin\\" and isolates sections of the body toward funk rhythms, especially sectioning through separating the rib cage from the hip. \\"Wormin\\" was innovated by Jerry Rentie of One Plus One.,Guzman-Sanchez, T. \\"The Oakland Funk Boogaloo Generation\\".

It generally focuses on the arms and hands, and includes sub-styles such as finger tutting.The Book of Dance 2012 - Page 129 1409322378 \\"Tutting was originally inspired by Egyptian hieroglyphics ‚Äì the name is an abbreviation for the Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun.

For years both before and after World War II, Billy Rose was a major force in entertainment, with shows such as Billy Rose's Crazy Quilt (1931), Jumbo (1935), Billy Rose's Aquacade (1937), and Carmen Jones (1943). As a lyricist, he is credited with many songs, notably \\"Don't Bring Lulu\\" (1925), \\"Tonight You Belong To Me\\" (1926), \\"Me and My Shadow\\" (1927), \\"More Than You Know\\" (1929), \\"Without a Song\\" (1929), \\"It Happened in Monterrey\\" (1930) and \\"It's Only a Paper Moon\\" (1933). Despite his accomplishments, Rose may be best known today as the husband of famed comedian and singer Fanny Brice (1891‚Äì1951). Life and work Rose was born to a Jewish family in New York City, United States. He attended Public School 44, where he was the 50-yard dash champion. While in high school, Billy studied shorthand under John Robert Gregg, the inventor of the Gregg System for shorthand notation. He won a dictation contest using Gregg notation, taking over 150 words per minute, and writing forward or backward with either hand. Billy Rose began his career as a stenographic clerk to Bernard Baruch of the War Industries Board during World War I, and became head of the clerical staff. Later he became a lyricist. In this role, he is best known as the credited writer or co-writer of the lyrics to \\"Me and My Shadow,\\" \\"Great Day\\" (with Edward Eliscu), \\"Does the Spearmint Lose Its Flavor on the Bedpost Overnight\\" (with Marty Bloom), \\"I Found a Million Dollar Baby\\" (with Mort Dixon) and \\"It's Only a Paper Moon\\" (with E. Y. Harburg). Most of Rose's lyrical credits were collaborations. Biographer Earl Conrad said, \\"Nobody clearly knew what he wrote or didn't write.... Publishers tend to credit him with writing the songs known to bear his name as a lyricist.... But tales rumble on ... that Billy could feed and toss in a remark and monkey around, but that others did most of the writing.\\" Lyricists might have been willing to tolerate a Rose credit grab because Rose was very successful at promoting \\"his\\" songs. He went on to become a Broadway producer, and a theatre/nightclub owner. In June 1934, he opened The Billy Rose Music Hall at 52nd and Broadway in New York with the first Benny Goodman Orchestra. He produced Jumbo, starring Jimmy Durante, at the New York Hippodrome Theatre. For the Fort Worth Frontier Days fair (1936‚Äì37), he constructed the huge elaborate dinner theatre Casa Ma√±ana which featured celebrated fan-dancer Sally Rand and the world's largest revolving stage. He presented a show at the Great Lakes Exposition in Cleveland, Ohio in 1937 where he also displayed the \\"Aquacade\\".\\"GREAT LAKES EXPOSITION\\" in Encyclopedia of Cleveland History. Case Western Reserve UniversityDeMarco, Laura. \\"Greatness on the Lake.\\" Sun News [Cleveland] July‚ÄìAug. 2016, Life sec.: 1. Print. Rose was diminutive in stature. When he attended a show, his practice was to book four seats: one for himself, one for his date, and the two in front of those so he would have an unobstructed view. In 1929, he married Fanny Brice, who went on to star in the 1931 Broadway production of Billy Rose's Crazy Quilt. The marriage lasted for nine years, ending in divorce in 1938. In 1938, he opened Billy Rose's Diamond Horseshoe, a nightclub in New York City's Times Square in the basement of the Paramount Hotel. It initially opened with a version of his Fort Worth show. The Diamond Horseshoe operated under that name until 1951. At the 1939 New York World's Fair, Billy Rose's Aquacade starred Olympian Eleanor Holm in what the fair program called \\"a brilliant girl show of spectacular size and content.\\" Future MGM star Esther Williams and Tarzan star Johnny Weissmuller were both Aquacade headliners. Rose began an affair with the then-married Holm, who left her husband for Rose. The couple married in 1939. Following the 1939 World's Fair, Rose asked John Murray Anderson, who had staged the Aquacade, to recommend a choreographer for a new show at the Horseshoe. Anderson recommended Gene Kelly, then performing in William Saroyan's One for the Money. Rose objected that he wanted someone who could choreograph \\"tits and asses,\\" not \\"soft-soap from a crazy Armenian\\" (Yudkoff, 2001). However, after seeing Kelly's performance, he gave Kelly the job, an important step in Kelly's career. In 1943, he produced Carmen Jones with an all-black cast. An adaptation of Georges Bizet's opera Carmen, the story was transplanted to World War II America by lyricist and librettist Oscar Hammerstein II. It was an instant hit. The New York Telegraph called it \\"far and away the best show in New York\\"; The New York Times said it was \\"beautifully done ... just call it wonderful.\\" The New York Herald Tribune said that Oscar Hammerstein II \\"must be considered one of the greatest librettists of our day\\" and that Carmen Jones was \\"a masterly tour de force.\\" It was made into a motion picture in 1954, for which Dorothy Dandridge received an Oscar nomination. In 1946, Rose's memoir Wine, Women and Words, dedicated to Rose's early patron Bernard M. Baruch, was published in New York by Simon & Schuster. The book was illustrated, including the cover of the numbered and signed first edition of 1500 copies, by Salvador Dal√≠ whom Rose met while producing events at the 1939 World's Fair. Following the publication of Wine, Women and Words Rose appeared on the cover of Time on June 2, 1947. Rose and Holm divorced in 1954. On July 2, 1956, he married showgirl Joyce Mathews, and they divorced July 23, 1959. They then remarried on December 29, 1961, only to divorce again on February 10, 1964, exactly two years before he died. (In the 1940s, Mathews had twice married and twice divorced comedian Milton Berle.) Later in 1964, Rose married Doris Vidor, who was the widow of film director Charles Vidor. Billy Rose founded the Billy Rose Sculpture Garden at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, Israel. His legendary pragmatism is illustrated by a seeming minor event at the sculpture garden opening ceremony, which Rose attended personally. When asked by one of the many distinguished guests what, in the event of war, Rose would have Israel do with these artworks, many of which were modern, steel abstracts, Rose unsmilingly replied, \\"Melt them down for bullets.\\" From 1949 until 1955, Rose was the owner-operator of the Ziegfeld Theatre. During that time, the theater housed four musicals and five plays. In 1965, he sold the theater to be demolished to make way for a new skyscraper, the Fisher Bros. Building. Billy Rose was a board member of American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers. ASCAP often slandered rock-and-roll songs. In general, Rock and Roll performers wrote the music and lyrics themselves. Consequently, as rock musicians increasingly wrote their own songs, professional songwriters, formerly dominant figures in music industry, encountered less demand for their work. As an ASCAP member, Billy Rose labeled rock-and-roll songs \\"junk\\" and was quoted as saying, \\"in many cases they are obscene junk much on the level with dirty comic magazines.\\"David P. Szatmary, Rockin' in Time, 8th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson, 2014), p. 25. Later years and death Billy Rose (standing) visiting David Ben-Gurion in 1960 Billy Rose's mausoleum in Westchester Hills Cemetery From 1959 until his death in 1966, he was also the owner-operator of the Billy Rose Theater. During that time the theater housed four plays, one musical, one revue, three ballets, and twenty-nine concert performances. After his death, the theater retained its name, and remained in the ownership of his estate until 1978, when it was renamed. Today it is the Nederlander Theatre. Rose was a wealthy man when he died of lobar pneumonia at his vacation home in Montego Bay, Jamaica at the age of 66.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/900/billy-rose At the time of his death, his fortune was estimated at about $42 million ($ in dollars), which he left entirely to a foundation named after him, disowning both of his sisters. He is interred at Westchester Hills Cemetery in Hastings- on-Hudson, New York. In 1970, Rose was inducted into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame. Depictions Rose was a leading character in the 1975 musical film Funny Lady, a sequel to Funny Girl, which continues the story of Fanny Brice, again played by Barbra Streisand. Despite physical dissimilarities, actor James Caan was cast as Rose. The 1962 film Billy Rose's Jumbo, starring Doris Day, depicted the original Broadway show staged by Rose. Although he was not involved in the making of the film, a contractual stipulation made it mandatory that his name appear in the title.

","title":"HETE"},{"id":"333472","text":"The High Energy Transient Explorer (abbreviated HETE; also known as Explorer 79) was an American astronomical satellite with international participation (mainly Japan and France). The prime objective of HETE was to carry out the first multiwavelength study of gamma-ray bursts with UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray instruments mounted on a single, compact spacecraft. A unique feature of the HETE mission was its capability to localize GRBs with ~10 arc second accuracy in near real time aboard the spacecraft, and to transmit these positions directly to a network of receivers at existing ground-based observatories enabling rapid, sensitive follow-up studies in the radio, IR, and optical bands. The satellite bus for the first HETE-1 was designed and built by AeroAstro, Inc. of Herndon, VA; the replacement satellite, HETE-2, was built by MIT based on the original HETE design. Launch attempts The first HETE was lost during the launch on November 4, 1996. The Pegasus rocket achieved a good orbit, but explosive bolts releasing HETE from another satellite (Argentina's SAC-B) and from its DPAF (Dual Payload Attach Fitting) envelope failed to charge, dooming both satellites. A battery on the third stage of the rocket and responsible for these bolts cracked during the ascent. Pegasus XL rocket carrying the SAC-B and HETE satellites. A second HETE satellite, HETE-2, was launched on October 9, 2000 in a follow-up mission. It was similar to the first HETE, but replaced the UV camera with an additional X-ray camera (Soft X-ray Camera or SXC) capable of higher localization accuracy than the original X-ray instrument (Wide-Field X-ray Monitor or WXM). HETE-2 was placed in a 625 km altitude Earth orbit with an inclination of 0-2 degrees. Originally planned operational life was 18 months. The mission continued until March 2008. Achievements Among the achievements of the HETE-2 mission are: # The discovery of GRB 030329, a widely observed, nearby gamma ray burst, firmly connecting GRBs with supernovas. # The discovery of GRB 050709, which was the first short/hard GRB to be found with an optical counterpart, leading to a firm establishment of the cosmological origin of this subclass of GRBs. # Dark bursts, or GRBs previously thought to have no optical counterparts, are not completely optically dark. Some of these dark GRBs fade in the optical very rapidly, others are dimmer but detectable with large (meter class) telescopes. # The establishment of another subclass of GRBs, the less energetic X-Ray Flashes (XRF), and its first optical counterpart. # The first to send out arcminute positions of GRBs to the observation community within tens of seconds of the onset of GRB (and in a few instances, while the burst was ongoing). Burst alert summary The HETE website lists 6 GRBs in 2001, 19 in 2002, 25 in 2003, 19 in 2004, 12 in 2005, and 3 in 2006 - the last reported being in March 2006. The trigger summaries list 2 GRBs in May 2006 and an XRB in Jan 2007. Latest status As of March 2007, \\"the operational efficiency of the HETE spacecraft and instruments has decreased due to the advanced age of the NiCd batteries on board.\\" The mission ended in March 2008.

Doug Ford is the 26th and current premier of Ontario. He took office on June 29, 2018, following the 2018 Ontario election where his Progressive Conservative (PC) party won a majority of seats in the Ontario Legislature.  Appointment  The premier is appointed as the province's head of government by the lieutenant governor of Ontario and presides over the Executive Council, or Cabinet. The Executive Council Act stipulates that the leader of the government party is known as the \\"Premier and President of the Council\\". Due to Ontario being a parliamentary-style government, the premier is typically the leader of the party which has the most support in the legislature at that time. However, the premier does not have to be serving in parliament to be appointed premier. In practice, this is highly unlikely to occur in a majority-government situation, while it can occur in a minority-government situation if the government is struck down by its previous partners.  History  Ontario's first premier was John Sandfield Macdonald, in office from 1867 to 1871. The longest serving premier in Ontario history was Sir Oliver Mowat, in office from 1872 to 1896. The position of premier was formerly written as \\"Prime Minister of Ontario\\" until the government of Bill Davis formally changed the title to premier.

Beginning her career with the State of Arizona as a secretary, Mofford worked her way up the ranks to become the state's first female secretary of state and first female governor. Early life Mofford was born Rose Perica in Globe, Arizona, on June 10, 1922, the youngest of six children. Her parents, Frances (Oberstar) and John Perica, had immigrated to the United States from Croatia, then part of Austria‚ÄìHungary. The first female class president in the history of Globe High School, she had success in both academics and athletics. She played basketball and was an All-American softball player. She graduated in 1939 as class valedictorian and, based upon her father's advice, turned down an opportunity to play professional basketball with the All American Red Heads.Jennings, Marianne M. \\"Rose Mofford\\". In Myers, John L. (ed.). The Arizona governors, 1912‚Äì1990. Phoenix, AZ: Heritage Publishers, , 1989 p.177. Career Following high school, Mofford began her career as a secretary for State Treasurer Joe Hunt. She was eighteen when she started working for him, and earned a salary of $125 a month. Two years later, when Hunt was promoted to the Arizona Tax Commission, Mofford followed her boss to the new position. In 1945, she left the Tax Commission and became business manager for Arizona Highways, a state magazine. Mofford returned to the Tax Commission in 1947 as executive secretary. Following Hunt's retirement in 1960, new commissioner Thad Moore fired Mofford, saying \\"we felt it was better to have a man in that job.\\" Following her dismissal from the Tax Commission, Mofford was hired as an executive secretary by Secretary of State Wesley Bolin. She remained in the Secretary of State's office until 1975, when she became assistant director of the State Revenue Department (formerly the Tax Commission). =Secretary of State of Arizona= Sign commemorating Rose Mofford outside the State Capitol building in Phoenix, Arizona. When Governor Ra√∫l Castro announced his resignation to become Ambassador to Argentina, Secretary Bolin ascended to the governorship. Arizona does not have a lieutenant governor; the secretary of state stands first in the line of succession to the governorship if retaining office by election. Bolin in turn appointed Mofford to serve the remainder of his term as Secretary of State. Bolin died in office on March 4, 1978. Although Mofford was Secretary of State, she held that post by appointment, so she could not ascend to the governorship; instead, Attorney General Bruce Babbitt became governor. At the end of the term she ran for a full term as Secretary of State and won. She was reelected in 1982 and 1986. In 1982 she won the election by nearly a 2-1 ratio, and won unopposed in 1986. Mofford became known in the state capital as the friendly woman with a beehive hairdo, and her office gained a reputation as an efficient operation. She herself was noted for her punctuality, answering her own phone and replying directly to her mail. In addition to her state position, she served from 1982 until 1983 as president of the National Association of Secretaries of State.Jennings, Marianne M. \\"Rose Mofford\\". In Myers, John L. (ed.). The Arizona governors, 1912‚Äì1990. Phoenix, AZ: Heritage Publishers, , 1989 p.180. Although Arizona is considered a traditionally Republican state, Democrat Mofford was well-liked by members of both parties. She was known for her bipartisanship and her ability to reach across the political aisle. =Governor of Arizona= Governor Evan Mecham was impeached on February 8, 1988. Per the Arizona Constitution, his powers were suspended and Mofford became acting governor. While most observers complimented her on the job she performed, Mecham objected to Mofford replacing the one state department head that he had appointed. Mecham was convicted on two of four articles in the impeachment trial and removed from office on April 4, 1988. Mofford was sworn in as Governor for the balance of Mecham's term, despite the fact that Article V, Section 2, of the Arizona Constitution, then provided that all state office holders must be male persons. In an election held on November 8, 1988, Arizona voters adopted Proposition 103, eliminating the gender-specific qualification for office. Mofford was thought to have had a rocky transition to the governorship at first, as she faced a collapse of the real-estate market and a high deficit left over from the previous administration. Mofford's primary goal as governor was to return stability to Arizona. She was called \\"the healing governor\\", and some thought it was her duty as governor to repair the state. Mofford also received this nickname due to her ability to ease racial division in Arizona, which some considered a problem under Mecham. Her efforts were widely held as providing a calming effect following the tumultuous impeachment and recall proceedings of her predecessor.Jennings, Marianne M. \\"Rose Mofford\\". In Myers, John L. (ed.). The Arizona governors, 1912‚Äì1990. Phoenix, AZ: Heritage Publishers, , 1989 p.182. State Senate Democratic leader Alfredo Gutierrez said of her actions, \\"What she did was reinvest the system with dignity and honor.\\" During her time in office, Mofford was one of only three female governors in the country. Mofford fought for higher bonding limits and increased funding for mental health programs in Arizona. She strongly opposed English-only instruction in Arizona schools and considered herself an advocate for civil liberties. Known for her fondness for athletics, Mofford created a funding mechanism to keep Major League Baseball's Cactus League in the state. She created the Governor's Alliance Against Drugs, the Governor's Youth Commission Against Drugs, and managed the formation of the state's first Drug Prevention Resource Center. The governor formed a task force to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic statewide, as a response to its rising national concern; during this time, the HIV/AIDS crisis was an issue thought to be ignored by politicians throughout the country. Mofford tried to increase political leadership opportunities for women in the state, appointing more minorities and women to commissions, boards, and courts than any other past Arizona governor. Mofford advocated for the re-establishment of Martin Luther King Day as a paid state holiday; this holiday had been rescinded under her predecessor. The holiday was eventually reinstated by popular vote in 1992 after she had left office. In 1988, Mofford stated her opposition to a bill banning abortions in the state (except in extreme cases), claiming it was unconstitutional. The proposed legislation was rejected by the state legislature by one vote. Mofford enjoyed a high level of popularity in the state, but her popularity decreased when she commuted two murder sentences in 1989; convicted murderers James Hamm and Carl Kummerlowe were able to attain early parole under her commutations, which she later tried to rescind. In early 1990, Mofford announced that she had decided not to run for election to a full four-year term. She was succeeded by Fife Symington. Mofford told reporters in 1990 that she hoped to be remembered \\"as a caring governor, because I cared about everybody in Arizona\\".  Awards  Mofford received the Distinguished Public Servant and Dedicated Humanitarian Award from St. Jude's Research Hospital. In 1988, she won Valley Leadership's Outstanding Woman of the Year Award. She was a recipient of the Arizona Heritage Award in 2004. She was honored as an Arizona Historymaker from The Historical League in 1999. Former Phoenix mayor Skip Rimsza established June 10 as \\"Rose Mofford Day\\". She was a member of the Arizona Softball Hall of Fame, and municipal softball fields are named in her honor in both Butler and Phoenix. Later life After leaving office, Mofford dedicated her time to civic and charitable activities. She served as chair of the campaign committee of Attorney General Terry Goddard's unsuccessful 2010 election bid for Governor of Arizona. She worked with former lawmaker Leo Corbet to help people in Arizona get organ transplants under the state health insurance. She often frequented residence homes for the elderly, and washed, sorted, and donated clothes to homeless shelters until she was 91. Even after she left office, Mofford was considered a mentor to several Arizona politicians. She would often use her influence in politics to help others rise up in the ranks. Former Senator Dennis DeConcini remembered asking Mofford for advice after taking a job as a gubernatorial staffer. Mofford would make calls for him to help him rise up in the ranks, which \\"opened a lot of doors\\" according to DeConcini. In the 2004 US presidential election, Mofford was a Democratic elector for Arizona supporting the presidential campaign of then-US Senator John Kerry. Arizona was won by incumbent President George W. Bush that year.http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/electors.php?year=2004&fips;=4&f;=0&off;=0&elect;=0 In a 2010 interview, Mofford said, \\"I attribute my success in life to my roots, religion, and my Rolodex\\". She created the Rolodex when she first starting working in government in 1940, eventually compiling 4,000 contacts. Personal life In 1957, Rose Perica married Thorald Robert \\"Lefty\\" Mofford, a captain with the Phoenix Police Department. The couple divorced after a decade, but remained friends until his death in 1983; Rose Mofford retained Lefty's surname. They did not have children, and Rose Mofford never remarried. Mofford identified as a devout Catholic. She considered religion to be a driving force in her success both in politics and as a leader. She contributed to the Missionaries of Charity, a foundation created by Mother Theresa. Her commitment to her faith was thought to have made her more popular among Arizonians. =Death= On August 31, 2016, after falling at her home, Mofford was admitted to a hospice. She died there on September 15, 2016, at the age of 94. After Mofford's death, Governor Doug Ducey said that \\"rising through the ranks of state government to our state's top office, she [Mofford] shattered a once-thought-unbreakable glass ceiling and served as an unparalleled role model to many\\". =Grave marker= Grave of Governor Mofford In 2017, a new grave marker was unveiled for Mofford's grave, which includes among other things images of her meeting Pope John Paul II in 1987 and Mother Teresa in 1989; those meetings were some of her favorite times as governor.

He also made numerous contributions to plant taxonomy, notably erecting a number of plant families that are still accepted today; and numerous Australian plant genera and species, the fruit of his exploration of that continent with Matthew Flinders. Early life Brown was born in Montrose on 21 December 1773, in a house that existed on the site where Montrose Library currently stands. He was the son of James Brown, a minister in the Scottish Episcopal Church with Jacobite convictions so strong that in 1788 he defied his church's decision to give allegiance to George III. His mother was Helen Brown n√©e Taylor, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister. As a child Brown attended the local Grammar School (now called Montrose Academy), then Marischal College at Aberdeen, but withdrew in his fourth year when the family moved to Edinburgh in 1790. His father died late the following year. Brown enrolled to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh, but developed an interest in botany, and ended up spending more of his time on the latter than the former. He attended the lectures of John Walker; made botanical expeditions into the Scottish Highlands, alone or with nurserymen such as George Don; and wrote out meticulous botanical descriptions of the plants he collected. He also began corresponding with and collecting for William Withering, one of the foremost British botanists of his day. Highlights for Brown during this period include his discovery of a new species of grass, Alopecurus alpinus; and his first botanical paper, \\"The botanical history of Angus\\", read to the Edinburgh Natural History Society in January 1792, but not published in print in Brown's lifetime.Mabberley (1985) pp. 18‚Äì28. Brown as a young man Brown dropped out of his medical course in 1793. Late in 1794, he enlisted in the Fifeshire Fencibles, and his regiment was posted to Ireland shortly after. In June 1795 he was appointed Surgeon's Mate. His regiment saw very little action, however, he had a good deal of leisure time, almost all of which he spent on botany. He was frustrated by his itinerant lifestyle, which prevented him from building his personal library and specimen collection as he would have liked, and cut him off from the most important herbaria and libraries.Mabberley (1985) p. 28‚Äì60. During this period Brown was especially interested in cryptogams, and these would be the subject of Brown's first, albeit unattributed, publication. Brown began a correspondence with James Dickson, and by 1796 was sending him specimens and descriptions of mosses. Dickson incorporated Brown's descriptions into his Fasciculi plantarum cryptogamicarum britanniae, with Brown's permission but without any attribution. By 1800, Brown was firmly established amongst Irish botanists, and was corresponding with a number of British and foreign botanists, including Withering, Dickson, James Edward Smith and Jos√© Correia da Serra. He had been nominated to the Linnean Society of London; had contributed to Dickson's Fasciculi; was acknowledged in a number of other works; and had had a species of algae, Conferva brownii (now Aegagropila linnaei) named after him by Lewis Weston Dillwyn. He had also begun experimenting with microscopy. However, as an army surgeon stationed in Ireland there seemed little prospect of him attracting the notice of those who could offer him a career in botany. To Australia on the Investigator In 1798, Brown heard that Mungo Park had withdrawn from a proposed expedition into the interior of New Holland (now Australia), leaving a vacancy for a naturalist. At Brown's request, Correia wrote to Sir Joseph Banks, suggesting Brown as a suitable replacement: He was not selected, and the expedition did not end up going ahead as originally proposed, though George Caley was sent to New South Wales as a botanical collector for Banks. In 1800, however, Matthew Flinders put to Banks a proposal for an expedition that would answer the question whether New Holland was one island or several. Banks approved Flinders' proposal, and in December 1800 wrote to Brown offering him the position of naturalist to the expedition. Brown accepted immediately.Mabberley (1985), pp. 59‚Äì63. =Preparations= Brown was told to expect to sail at the end of 1800, only a few weeks after being offered the position. A succession of delays meant the voyage did not get under way until July 1801. Brown spent much of the meantime preparing for the voyage by studying Banks' Australian plant specimens and copying out notes and descriptions for use on the voyage.Mabberley (1985), pp. 66‚Äì72. Though Brown's brief was collect scientific specimens of all sorts, he was told to give priority to plants, insects, and birds, and to treat other fields, such as geology, as secondary pursuits. In addition to Brown, the scientific staff comprised the renowned botanical illustrator Ferdinand Bauer; the gardener Peter Good, whose task was to collect live plants and viable seed for the use of Kew Gardens; the miner John Allen, appointed as mineralogist; the landscape artist William Westall; and the astronomer John Crosley, who would fall ill on the voyage out and leave the ship at the Cape of Good Hope, being belatedly replaced at Sydney by James Inman. Brown was given authority over Bauer and Good, both of whom were instructed to give any specimens they might collect to Brown, rather than forming separate collections. Both men would provide enthusiastic and hard-working companions for Brown, and thus Brown's specimen collections contain material collected by all three men. =Desertas, Madeira and the Cape of Good Hope= Investigator sailed from London on 18 July. They made brief landfalls at Bugio Island (Desertas Islands) and Madeira, but Brown was disappointed to collect almost nothing of note from either site. They arrived at the Cape of Good Hope on 16 October, staying a little over two weeks, during which time Brown made extensive botanical expeditions, and climbed Table Mountain at least twice. Many years later he would write to William Henry Harvey, who was considering emigrating there, that \\"some of the pleasantest botanizing he ever had was on Devil's Mountain, near Cape Town, and he thought I could not pitch on a more delightful field of study.\\" Amongst the plants collected at the Cape were two new species of Serruria (Proteaceae), S. foeniculacea and S. flagellaris.Mabberley (1985), pp. 73‚Äì79. =Australia= arrived in King George Sound in what is now Western Australia in December 1801. For three and a half years Brown did intensive botanic research in Australia, collecting about 3400 species, of which about 2000 were previously unknown. A large part of this collection was lost when was wrecked en route to England. Brown remained in Australia until May 1805. He then returned to Britain where he spent the next five years working on the material he had gathered. He published numerous species descriptions; in Western Australia alone he is the author of nearly 1200 species. The list of major Australian genera that he named includes: Livistona, Triodia, Eriachne, Caladenia, Isolepis, Prasophyllum, Pterostylis, Patersonia, Conostylis, Thysanotus, Pityrodia, Hemigenia, Lechenaultia, Eremophila, Logania, Dryandra, Isopogon, Grevillea, Petrophile, Telopea, Leptomeria, Jacksonia, Leucopogon, Stenopetalum, Ptilotus, Sclerolaena and Rhagodia.Keighery, G. and Gibson, N., 'The influence of Robert Brown on Western Australian botany', Australian Garden History, 14 (3), 2002, pp. 5‚Äì8. Subsequent career In early 1809 he read his paper called On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae to the Linnean Society of London. This was subsequently published in March 1810 as On the Proteaceae of Jussieu. It is significant for its contribution to the systematics of Proteaceae, and to the floristics of Australia, and also for its application of palynology to systematics. This work was extensively plagiarised by Richard Anthony Salisbury, who had memorised much of the Linnean reading and then inserted it in Joseph Knight's 1809 publication On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae. In 1810, he published the results of his collecting in his famous Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen, the first systematic account of the Australian flora. Over half of New Zealand's orchid genera were first described in the work. That year, he succeeded Jonas C. Dryander as Sir Joseph Banks' librarian, and on Banks' death in 1820 Brown inherited his library and herbarium. This was transferred to the British Museum in 1827, and Brown was appointed Keeper of the Banksian Botanical Collection. In 1818 he published Observations, systematical and geographical, on the herbarium collected by Professor Christian Smith, in the vicinity of the Congo. In 1822, he was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society and a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1827 he became correspondent of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands, three years later he became associated member. When the institute became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1851 Brown joined as foreign member. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1849. In a paper read to the Linnean society in 1831 and published in 1833, Brown named the cell nucleus. The nucleus had been observed before, perhaps as early as 1682 by the Dutch microscopist Leeuwenhoek, and Franz Bauer had noted and drawn it as a regular feature of plant cells in 1802, but it was Brown who gave it the name it bears to this day (while giving credit to Bauer's drawings). Neither Bauer nor Brown thought the nucleus to be universal, and Brown thought it to be primarily confined to Monocotyledons. After the division of the Natural History Department of the British Museum into three sections in 1837, Robert Brown became the first Keeper of the Botanical Department, remaining so until his death. He was succeeded by John Joseph Bennett. He served as President of the Linnean Society from 1849 to 1853. Brown in 1855 Brown died at 17 Dean Street, Soho Square in London, on 10 June 1858. He was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery in London. Brown's name is commemorated in the Australia herb genus Brunonia as well as numerous Australian species such as Eucalyptus brownii, Banksia brownii and the moss Brown's Tetrodontium Moss (Tetrodontium brownianum), a species which he discovered growing at Roslin near Edinburgh whilst still a student. The plant can still be found at the site of its discovery.\\"Bryology (mosses, liverworts and hornworts)\\" Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. Retrieved 15 May 2008. Passing through the suburb of Kingston, south of Hobart, Tasmania, formerly Van Diemen's Land, is Brown's River, named in his honor, upon the banks of which, he collected botanical samples. In South Australia, Mount Brown and Point Brown (near Smoky Bay) were named for him by Flinders during the Investigator expedition. Mount Brown in British Columbia, Canada was named for him by David Douglas.. In 1938 the London County Council commemorated Brown, as well as botanists Joseph Banks and David Don, and meetings of the Linnean Society, with a rectangular stone plaque at 32 Soho Square. A small New Zealand tree Pisonia brunoniana was named in recognition of him, and Cape Brown (Greenland) was named by William Scoresby (1789‚Äì1857) in 1822 in his honour.Place names, NE Greenland  Brownian motion  In 1827, while examining grains of pollen of the plant Clarkia pulchella suspended in water under a microscope, Brown observed minute particles, now known to be amyloplasts (starch organelles) and spherosomes (lipid organelles), ejected from the pollen grains, executing a continuous jittery motion. He then observed the same motion in particles of inorganic matter, enabling him to rule out the hypothesis that the effect was life-related. Although Brown did not provide a theory to explain the motion the phenomenon is now known as Brownian motion. In recent years controversy arose over whether Brown's microscopes were insufficient to reveal phenomena of this order. Brown's discoveries were denied in a brief paper in 1991.\\\\- See also Bulletin of the American Physical Society, 36 (4): 1374, April 1991. Shortly thereafter, in an illustrated presentation, British microscopist Brian J. Ford presented to Inter Micro 1991 in Chicago a reprise of the demonstration using Brown's original microscope. His video sequences substantiated Brown's observations, suggesting Brown's microscope was sufficient to allow him to see motion.\\\\- See also this site. Physicist Phil Pearle and colleagues presented a detailed discussion of Brown's original observations of particles from pollen of Clarkia pulchella undergoing Brownian motion, including the relevant history, botany, microscopy, and physics.Pearle, P., Collett, B., Bart, K., Bilderback, D., Newman, D., and Samuels, S.

His father and mother were employed at Izhmash, a Soviet arms factory. His father was a mechanic. Nikonov graduated from technical school in 1968 . At Izhmash, he took evening classes. In 1975 he graduated from the Izhevsk Mechanical Institute certified as a gun engineer.  Design career  He started work at Izhmash in the Department of the Chief Arms Designer. His first position was as a technician. In technical school, Nikonov became obsessed with underwater rifles. He won his first professional recognition by designing a trigger mechanism for an underwater rifle. He designed various rifles, including air guns and sporting firearms. One of the most praised was the stylish, accurate \\"Izjubr\\" (Buck Deer) carbine - a limited edition luxury weapon. Nikonov was appointed as a senior project engineer to design single-shot bolt action rifles and fully automatic weapons. In this assignment he patented a number of mechanisms and components. One of the most significant was the \\"straight-pull bolt,\\" first used in a winter biathlon target rifle. Nikonov also worked on research projects. In the middle 1970s he entered a post-graduate Ph.D course. From 1980 to 1985 he worked on projects for the Soviet Ministry for Defense Industry. Examples of his innovation include his twin-barreled machine gun and the \\"blow back shifted pulse (BBSP)\\" used on the AN-94. It is said that his high quality and quantity of work helped him advance to higher positions at work. He was married with two sons, Nikolay and Yuri.

The society takes its name from the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, the 'father of taxonomy', who systematised biological classification through his binomial nomenclature. He was known as Carl von Linn√© after his ennoblement, hence the spelling 'Linnean', rather than 'Linnaean'. The society had a number of minor name variations before it gained its Royal Charter on 26 March 1802, when the name became fixed as \\"The Linnean Society of London\\". In 1802, as a newly incorporated society, it comprised 228 fellows. It is the oldest extant natural history society in the world.Gage A.T. and Stearn W.T. (1988) A Bicentenary History of the Linnean Society of London, Linnean Society of London, pp. 2, 19 Throughout its history the society has been a non-political and non-sectarian institution, existing solely for the furtherance of natural history.Gage A.T. and Stearn W.T. (1988) A Bicentenary History of the Linnean Society of London, Linnean Society of London, p. 148 The inception of the society was the direct result of the purchase by Sir James Edward Smith of the specimen, book and correspondence collections of Carl Linnaeus. When the collection was offered for sale by Linnaeus's heirs, Smith was urged to acquire it by Sir Joseph Banks, the eminent botanist and President of the Royal Society. Five years after this purchase Banks gave Smith his full support in founding the Linnean Society, and became one of its first Honorary Members.O'Brian, P. (1987) Joseph Banks, Collins Harvill. p. 240 The society has numbered many prominent scientists amongst its fellows. One such was the botanist Robert Brown, who was Librarian, and later President (1849-1853); he named the cell nucleus and discovered Brownian motion. In 1854 Charles Darwin was elected a fellow; he is undoubtedly the most illustrious scientist ever to appear on the membership rolls of the society.Gage A.T. and Stearn W.T. (1988) A Bicentenary History of the Linnean Society of London, Linnean Society of London, p. 53 Another famous fellow was biologist Thomas Huxley, who would later gain the nickname \\"Darwin's bulldog\\" for his outspoken defence of Darwin and evolution. Men notable in other walks of life have also been fellows of the society, including the physician Edward Jenner, pioneer of vaccination, the Arctic explorers Sir John Franklin and Sir James Clark Ross, colonial administrator and founder of Singapore, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles and Prime Minister of Britain, Lord Aberdeen.Gage A.T. and Stearn W.T. (1988) A Bicentenary History of the Linnean Society of London, Linnean Society of London, pp. 50, 53, 197-198 Since 1857 the society has been based at Burlington House, Piccadilly, London; an address it shares with a number of other learned societies: the Geological Society of London, the Royal Astronomical Society, the Society of Antiquaries of London and the Royal Society of Chemistry.Gage A.T. and Stearn W.T. (1988) A Bicentenary History of the Linnean Society of London, Linnean Society of London, p. 51 The first public exposition of the 'Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection', arguably the greatest single leap of progress made in biology, was presented to a meeting of the Linnean Society on 1 July 1858. At this meeting a joint presentation of papers by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace was made, sponsored by Joseph Hooker and Charles Lyell as neither author could be present.Cohen, I.B. (1985) Revolution in Science, Harvard University Press, 1985, pp. 288-289 In 1904 the society elected its first female fellows, following a number of years of tireless campaigning by the botanist Marian Farquharson. Whilst the society's council was reluctant to admit women, the wider fellowship was more supportive; only 17% voted against the proposal. Among the first to benefit from this were the ornithologist and photographer Emma Louisa Turner, Lilian J. Veley, a microbiologist and Annie Lorrain Smith, a lichenologist and mycologist, all formally admitted on 19 January 1905.Gage A.T. and Stearn W.T.

In April 1939 the threat of war obliged the society to relocate the Linnean collections out of London to Woburn Abbey in Bedfordshire, where they remained for the duration of World War II. This move was facilitated by the 12th Duke of Bedford, a Fellow of the Linnean Society himself. Three thousand of the most precious items from the library collections were packed up and evacuated to Oxford; the country house of librarian Warren Royal Dawson provided a refuge for the society's records.Gage A.T. and Stearn W.T.

Her work revealed the structure of the flagellum and cilia, which are central to many systems of cellular motility.Biography of Irene Manton sponsored by the Linnean Society, in The Linnean, Special Issue No. 5 (2004) Recent years have seen an increased interest within the society in issues of biodiversity conservation. This was highlighted by the inception in 2015 of an annual award, the John Spedan Lewis Medal, specifically honouring persons making significant and innovative contributions to conservation.John Spedan Lewis Medal Membership Fellowship requires nomination by at least one fellow, and election by a minimum of two thirds of those electors voting. Fellows may employ the post-nominal letters 'FLS'. Fellowship is open to both professional scientists and to amateur naturalists who have shown active interest in natural history and allied disciplines. Having authored relevant publications is an advantage, but not a necessity, for election. Following election, new fellows must be formally admitted, in person at a meeting of the society, before they are able to vote in society elections. Admission takes the form of signing the membership book, and thereby agreeing to an obligation to abide by the statutes of the society. Following this the new fellow is taken by the hand by the president, who recites a formula of admission to the fellowship. Other forms of membership exist: 'Associate', for supporters of the society who do not wish to submit to the formal election process for fellowship, and 'Student Associate', for those registered as students at a place of tertiary education. Associate members may apply for election to the fellowship at any time. Finally, there are three types of membership that are prestigious and strictly limited in number: 'Fellow honoris causa', 'Foreign', and lastly, 'Honorary'. These forms of membership are bestowed following election by the fellowship at the annual Anniversary Meeting in May.Gage A.T. and Stearn W.T.

Over the following centuries the society published a number of different journals, some of which specialised in more specific subject areas, whilst earlier publications were discontinued. Those still in publication include: the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, which covers the evolutionary biology of all organisms, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, which focuses on plant sciences, and Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society focusing on animal systematics and evolution. The Linnean is a biannual newsletter. It contains commentary on recent activities and events, articles on history and science, and occasional biographies/obituaries of people connected to the Linnean Society; it also includes book reviews, reference material and correspondence. The society also publishes books and Synopses of the British Fauna, a series of field-guides.Gage A.T. and Stearn W.T.

It was mostly filmed in Richmond, Virginia. Plot Sam Simms (Sinbad) is a Secret Service agent assigned by his superior Wilkes (Robert Guillaume) to protect President Paul Davenport's (James Naughton) rebellious 13-year-old son Luke Davenport (Brock Pierce) after Luke's behavior causes another agent Woods (Timothy Busfield) to be replaced for mistreating Luke in front of media cameras. Woods is later fired because of this mistreatment and for failing his physical. Simms sees this assignment as undesirable, but a possible stepping stone to protecting the President. He fails to connect with the boy at first, and Luke continues to misbehave, including an incident where he releases his pet snake Poison into a White House party. After seeing Luke get beat up by the school bully Rob (Zachery Ty Bryan), his parents punished him for the fight, even though he didn't start the fight. Because of the re-election, they can't risk Luke going out of public for a month while his parents are on the campaign trail. Simms feels sorry for him - he had felt alone as a teenager, too (losing his father in Vietnam while his mother worked 2-3 jobs to financially support him) - and they become friends. Simms, a former boxer, agrees to sneak Luke out against the wishes of the chief of security Morton (Art LaFleur) and teach him how to fight. Meanwhile, Luke agonizes over asking the cutest girl, Katie (Erin Williby), to the school dance, which he finally does successfully with Simms's help. On the night of the dance, a duffle bag is left outside of the White House and Luke is not allowed to go due to the security risk, even though his parents gave him permission. Simms breaking the rules again takes Luke to the dance. There, Rob tries to attack Luke again while Simms is distracted, but this time Luke puts him down. After that, Secret Service agents bust the school dance and retrieve Luke. Simms is fired and not allowed to speak with Luke, who is crushed that his friend has apparently \\"abandoned\\" him. Luke, under house arrest and with a homing device attached to him, receives advice from an online friend, Mongoose12, on how to escape the White House and meet him at a local mall. Luke agrees, but it is revealed that Mongoose12 was in fact former agent Woods, who abducts him. When Luke goes missing, Simms is given another chance to protect him. With the help of his friend Harold (a paraplegic who owns a spy shop), he quickly tracks Luke to the mall. In a standoff, Woods says he was originally planning on returning Luke to the President so he could be a hero and get his job back, but now he wants to kill him instead. He blames Luke for making him lose his job, and even his wife. Woods tries to shoot Simms, but he takes cover and once Woods is out of bullets, Simms brings him down with a right uppercut. As other agents arrive, Woods tries to shoot Luke with a back-up revolver but Simms jumps in front of Luke, causing him to take the intended bullet in his arm. Woods is also shot, subdued, and arrested by other arriving Secret Service agents for abduction, assault, and attempted murder. In the final scene of the film, Simms is offered Presidential duty which he declines in order to stay with Luke full time, so he can also spend more time with Luke's biology teacher, with whom he has formed a romantic relationship. Luke is relieved of his last punishment, and while playing street hockey with friends, hits Simms in the forehead with the puck, resulting a chase-off between Simms and Luke.

Sonny plays himself as a Congressman coming to the White House, to visit the President. Simms bumps into him (literally) outside the Oval Office and fawns over him. It is the only major, scripted film that a then sitting President appeared in. Ratings *When First Kid was rated for video release by the BBFC, one minute and thirty one seconds were cut, due to the hostage attack in the shopping mall. At the time, the BBFC felt that this, and the sudden onslaught of violence, were too intense for a 'PG' certificate. In 2002, all cuts were waived for a 'PG' rating.http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/first-kid-1 Reception  =Box office= The movie debuted at #3. = Critical response = First Kid was poorly received from critics.

It was founded in 1860, named after the property of post master George Knight and became an important regional centre during the 19th Century. Today, Milton remains one of the two main commercial centres of the Milton-Ulladulla district, with a population at the of 1,663. It is a popular stopping place for travellers on the Princes Highway which runs through the centre of town. In recent years, Milton has undergone a resurgence largely influenced by the local tourism industry and an influx of residents to the district seeking a seachange. Several new housing estates are being developed on the fringes of the village and new boutique stores, cafes and bed and breakfast type businesses have located in the town. History The coastal area of the Milton-Ulladulla district was observed by Captain James Cook in 1770 when sailing along the east coast of Australia, before landing at Botany Bay. Cook noted the nearby Pigeon House Mountain, a prominent landmark. The Reverend Thomas Kendall was the first European settler to the area, issued a land grant in 1827. He named the estate \\"Kendall Dale\\" and commenced pastoral activities as well as cutting red cedar found in abundance near Narrawallee Creek. Poet Henry Kendall, the grandson of Thomas Kendall was born at the property near Milton in 1839. Further land grants in the 1830s led to a town site being surveyed in 1837 at Boat Harbour (present day Ulladulla). The district prospered through the 1840s on the back of the timber industry. Former convict, Henry Claydon took possession of 100 acres of land near Milton in 1855, establishing an estate known as Claydon Park. A devout Methodist, Claydon donated land in 1856 to the Wesleyan Church and the following year, the first church in the district was built on the site. The Sarah Claydon retirement village in Milton in named for Henry's wife, who worked as a Midwife in the area until her death in 1876. The village was formally established in 1860 as a private town on land owned by John Booth, soon after followed by the construction of several public buildings, including the Star Hotel (1860), St Peter and St Paul Anglican Church (1860), Uniting and Catholic churches (1872), Town Hall (1871), courthouse and public school (1877) and a post office (1880). As a town, Milton is classified with the Australian National Trust, due to the number of homes and buildings in the town that were built from 1870 onwards. The town has declined in importance as a regional centre through the 20th Century, but remains a popular tourist destination. Facilities and infrastructure =Health and Education= Milton has a public primary school; Milton Public School. Originally constructed in 1877, the school took its first enrollments in April 1878. From 1943 until 1973, it operated as a central school, catering for students of both primary and secondary age groups. The school has operated as a Kindergarten to Year 6 primary school since the beginning of 1974, and the original classroom is still in use alongside modern additions. Milton also has one private school. St Mary's Star of the Sea is a Catholic primary school located adjacent to the 1872 church. The Shoalhaven City Council operates a public library in the old town hall on the Princes Highway. The Milton Ulladulla Hospital (MUH) located in the town provides accident and emergency, general ward, obstetric, oncology and outpatient facilities. The hospital services southern Shoalhaven area from Sussex Inlet south to North Durras as part of the South Eastern Sydney and Illawarra Area Health Service. A helipad on Croobyar Road is used by the hospital for emergency evacuations. Milton Public School built in 1877 =Public Transport= Milton is the northern terminus for local bus services operated by Ulladulla Bus Lines. The town is serviced by Route 740 to Burrill Lake via Narrawallee, Mollymook and Ulladulla six days per week. Taxis and private hire cars are also available throughout the district. Premier Motor Service offer coach services on the South Coast which pick up in Milton travelling north to Nowra and Sydney, as well as south to Eden. Services operating to Nowra generally offer connections to Bomaderry railway station, the terminus of NSW TrainLink's Illawarra line. =Parks and recreation= Milton has a public swimming pool complex maintained by Shoalhaven City Council. The complex includes a 25m main pool, a shaded wading pool for toddlers and kiosk, along with picnic tables. The pools overlook the rural countryside, with views to the ocean. The Frogs Hollow sports ground located on Matron Porter Drive is home to the Milton Ulladulla Touch Football Association. Mick Ryan Park is a small botanical reserve containing a large heritage listed Illawarra little leaf fig tree believed to be over 180 years old. The tree covers a land area of close to one acre. The fig tree (ficus obliqua) in Mick Ryan Park Milton Theatre was originally built in 1927 as the Milton School of Arts and later used as a picture theatre before closing in 1993. The building was subsequently restored and now operates as a 200-seat venue hosting community performances, as well as visiting national and overseas artists. A grand reopening gala concert in July 1998 relaunched the theatre following a $460,000 renovation. The theatre also contains a recording studio and is managed by a community committee in cooperation with the Shoalhaven City Council. Notable artists who have performed at the theatre include Justin Townes Earle, Muddy Waters, Eric Bogle, Sarah Blasko and former Hunters & Collectors front man Mark Seymour who described it as the best live venue on the South Coast. Events and attractions Milton hosts a number of annual events and festivals, drawing visitors from as far away as Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. The Milton Show Society holds an annual agricultural show and exhibition featuring events including equestrian competition, produce displays, pet show and rodeo. The community event is held at the Milton Showgrounds on Croobyar Road on the first weekend in March. The Milton Scarecrow Festival is held annually on the Queen's birthday long weekend in June. The festival involves a theme which locals and visitors are encouraged to interpret through decorating scarecrows. Entertainment includes live performances, art and craft markets, a farmyard petting zoo and children's rides. Milton Village markets are held on the first Saturday of every month and on long weekends \\"The Settlement\\" is a row of Victorian era shops built in the 1870s on the Princes Highway at Milton. Businesses currently operating within this block include boutique restaurants and cafes, art galleries and antiques stores. Street markets focused around The Settlement are held on the first Saturday of each month as well as peak tourist times during Milton's festivals. Other activities available year round include guided tours showcasing the town's heritage as well as \\"ghost walks\\" every Thursday and Saturday night for those hoping to catch a glimpse of supernatural happenings.

Out of all the Andean countries, Bolivia remains perhaps the most culturally linked to the indigenous peoples.  History  Like most of its neighbors, Bolivia was long dominated by Spain and its attendant culture. Even after independence, Bolivian music was largely based on European forms. In 1952, a revolution established nationalistic reforms which included cultural and political awareness of the Aymara and Quechua natives. Intellectuals in the country began wearing ponchos and otherwise associating themselves with native cultures, and the new government promoted native folklore by, among other methods, establishing a folklore department in the Bolivian Ministry of Education. Awareness of native music, spirituality and art continued into the 1960s. In 1965, Edgar 'Yayo' Jofr√© formed a quartet called Los Jairas in La Paz. With Bolivian folk music gaining popularity throughout the country, Jofr√©, along with Alfredo Dominguez, Ernesto Cavour Julio Godoy, and Gilbert Favre used traditional music in modified forms to appeal to urban-dwellers and Europeans. Later groups like Wara, Khanata, Paja Brava, Savia Andina, and especially Los Kjarkas and Kalamarka helped further refine this fusion. Following a close but different path, groups and singers like Luzmila Carpio, Ruphay, and Grupo Aymara started touring abroad and gained international praise for their compositions, tunes that have brought indigenous Bolivian culture and history to the world's attention. Los K'jarkas consists of 3 brothers, the Hermosas, who play primarily Huay√±o or, more rarely, sayas. These are both dance music influenced both by native forms as well as African music imported to Bolivia with slavery. Los K'jarkas are known internationally for their Caporales classic \\"Llorando se fue\\", which was adopted and transformed to the popular beginning of the lambada dance craze of the 1980s, along with forr√≥ and carimbo in northern Brazil. The song was popularized by a French group, resulting in a successful lawsuit from the Hermosa brothers. Kalamarka was founded in 1984 by Hugo Gutierrez and Rodolfo Choque. They fusion folk instruments such as Zampo√±a, Quena, Charango and Bombo with modern instruments, creating a beautiful musica andina. Their famous songs are 'Cuando Florezca el Chu√±o' and 'Ama, Ama, Amazonas'. In the 1980s, Chilean nueva canci√≥n was imported to Bolivia and changed into canto nuevo, which was popularized by performers like Emma Junaro. Traditional Bolivian (and other South American) musical instruments include the charango, charang√≥n, ronroco, hualaycho, zampo√±a, quena, bombo, huancara, reco reco, chiapya box, pinquillo, tarka, toyos, pututu, Andean saxophone, and Chajchas, as well as European musical instruments such as the violin and guitar. Musical forms such as the Bailecito, Kullawada, Tonada (or, directly Tinku), Taquirari, Carnavalito, Lamento, Afro-Bolivian Saya, Tuntuna, Taki Taki and Cueca are prominently featured in Bolivia's cultural music.

W. Jacobs, first published in England in the collection The Lady of the Barge in 1902. In the story, three wishes are granted to the owner of The Monkey's Paw, but the wishes come with an enormous price for interfering with fate. It has been adapted many times in other media, including plays, films, TV series, operas, stories and comics, as early as 1903 and as recently as 2019. It was first adapted to film in 1915 as a British silent film directed by Sidney Northcote. The film (now lost) starred John Lawson, who also played the main character in Louis N. Parker's 1907 stage play.Workman, Christopher; Howarth, Troy (2016). \\"Tome of Terror: Horror Films of the Silent Era\\". Midnight Marquee Press. p. 158. . Plot Illustration for \\"The Monkey's Paw\\" from Jacobs' short story collection The Lady of the Barge (1902) The short story involves Mr. and Mrs. White and their adult son, Herbert. Sergeant-Major Morris, a friend who served with the British Army in India, comes by for dinner and introduces them to a mummified monkey's paw. An old fakir placed a spell on the paw, so that it would grant three wishes but only with hellish consequences as punishment for tampering with fate. Morris, having had a horrible experience using the paw, throws it into the fire. Mr. White, not believing Morris, retrieves it. Before leaving, Morris warns Mr. White that should he use the paw, he might as well be digging his own grave. At Herbert's suggestion, Mr. White flippantly wishes for ¬£200 (the equivalent of over ¬£24,000 in 2020), which will enable him to make the final mortgage payment for his house. When he makes his wish, Mr. White suddenly drops the paw in surprise, claiming that it moved and twisted like a snake. The next day, Herbert leaves for work at a local factory. A few minutes later an employee arrives at the Whites's home, pronouncing that Herbert has been killed in a terrible machine accident, mutilating his body. Although the company denies responsibility for the incident, the firm has decided to make a goodwill payment to the family of the deceased. The payment is ¬£200, the amount Mr. White had wished for. A week after the funeral, Mrs. White, mad with grief, insists that her husband use the paw to wish Herbert back to life. Reluctantly, he does so, despite remembering a premonition he had of summoning his son's mutilated and decomposing body. An hour or so later‚Äîthe cemetery being two miles away‚Äîthere is a knock at the door. As Mrs. White fumbles at the locks in a desperate attempt to open the door, Mr. White becomes terrified and fears \\"the thing outside\\" is not the son he loved. He makes his third wish. The knocking stops suddenly and Mrs. White opens the door to find no one is there.

It also includes the native pre-Columbian music from what is today Chilean territory. Music in Chile =Pre-Columbian and colonial times= Distribution of the pre-Hispanic people of Chile, Easter Island not included Prior to the arrival of the European conquerors, the modern national borders that make up the Americas did not exist, so one cannot refer to music from \\"Chile\\", or any other South American country, from this time. However, music existed in the Americas for centuries before European conquest, and many of the characteristics and instruments of pre-Hispanic music have formed part of the folkloric and musical tradition of Chile and of Latin America. Archaeological excavations have unearthed many musical instruments showing the existence of a variety of musical cultures in the area long before even the Inca period. Scientific research into remains left by the Nazca and Mochica peoples has shown the existence of complex theoretical musical systems, with the presence of minor intervals, semitones, chromaticism and musical scales of five, six, seven and eight notes, equivalent to contemporaneous cultures in Asia and Europe. Sociologist Carlos KellerHistoria de la musica en Chile, (Manuscrito) (ES) Keller Havestadt, Carlos Bernardo, memoria Chilena May 1973, retrieved on August 29, 2014] has compared the Inca occupation of the Andean region with the Roman occupation of Greece or the Aztec conquest of the Maya. Like the Aztecs and Romans, the Incas took the knowledge and traditions of the cultures they found and incorporated them into their own. Inca music was formed by elements of Nazca, Chim√∫, Colla ‚Äì Aymara and other cultures. It is also believed that the Incas were the first American people to develop some kind of formal music education. ;Atacama people When the Incas advanced over the north of Chile, they encountered different native peoples and absorbed elements of their culture, especially the Atacame√±os (Atacama people). The Atacame√±os - themselves highly influenced by the Nazca - were an organized society that inhabited parts of the Atacama Desert, mainly in the east and central sectors of the region, and spread as far as Central Chile. They were conquered by the Incas in the 15th century, but today still speak and sing some of the ancient songs in cunza, the original language of their people. Mapuche Machis with Kultrun, a traditional drum ;Mapuche people The Mapuche people were the main indigenous people populating the region running from Copiap√≥ in the north to Chilo√© in the south. The Mapuche were never conquered by the Incas, so their music and musical instruments differ from the northern cultures that fell under Andean influence. Spanish chroniclers observed their musical rituals with interest, and their observations have allowed historians to compare this early music with the Mapuche music of the modern day. Historian Samuel Marti writes that the Mapuche ‚Äúdo not dance or sing to demonstrate knowledge and skill, or to entertain spectators, but to honour their gods‚Äù.[Mart√≠, Samuel. Instrumentos Musicales Precortesianos, Mexico: Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, 1968 Mapuche music today, despite the influence of Christianity, is still an expression of faith, hopes or fears to the traditional gods, because the conquest did not change the spirit of these peoples, even though it introduced new cultural elements.S. Marti (98,15 ) \\"El ind√≠gena, apunta, no canta o baila para exhibir su destreza o sus conocimientos, ni tampoco trata de entretener o adular al espectador. El indigena canta y baila para honrar y propiciar a sus dioses ancestrales\\"... MENDOZA, Vicente. ‚ÄúMusica Precolombina en America‚Äù, Boletin Latino Americano de Musica, IV/4, Bogot√° (octubre de 1938), 235-257. The Franciscan missionary Geronimo de Ore (Lima, Peru, circa 1598) noted that Mapuche children learned songs from a very young age and demonstrated excellent memory and sense of rhythm. De Ore, realizing that these skills could be used as an evangelization and religious indoctrination tool, proposed that Christian prayers should have been taught in the native language and sung to native or European tunes. The same method was used in Chile by Jesuit priests. Jesuit priest Bernardo Havestadt came to Chile in 1748 and worked as missionary in La Mocha Concepci√≥n, Rere and Santa Fe. In 1777, he published a document in Westphalia that contains 19 Mapuche songs accompanied by European-style music. Unlike the Andean peoples, the Mapuches did not develop a theoretical musical system, but in practice one is imposed by the limitations of their instruments. The technique of playing these instruments has been preserved from generation to generation and melodies are formed by linking periods. There are no long notes in Mapuche music and the scales and melodic schemes of their music have no relation to the panphonic Andean music. In the seventeenth century, chronicler Gonzalez de Najera described the music as ‚Äúmore sad than happy‚Äù and the instruments as basic drums and flutes made of the shin bones of Spaniards and other native enemies.GONZALEZ DE NAJERA, Alonso.

It consists of a bow that is rubbed against another bow, with some chroniclers also describing a mouth bow. Membranophone instruments include the Makawa, or kakel kultrung, a double-headed drum; and the Kultrun or Cultrun, a ceremonial drum and the most important musical instrument in Mapuche culture, used by the machi (healer or sorcerer) for religious and cultural rituals. Idiophone instruments include the Kadkawilla or, a leather strap with jingle bells attached, which is played alongside the Cultrun; and the Wada or Huada, a rattle made of a pumpkin filled with small pebbles or seeds. ;Fueguinos Music in the southernmost regions of modern Chile was produced by the Fueguino peoples, native inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego, including the Onas, the Yaganes, the Yamanas and the Alacalufes).Yahgan & Ona - The Road to Extinction (EN) Author: ClayJason W. www.culturalsurvival.org Article copyright Cultural Survival, Inc. retrieved on October 1, 2014 The Fueginos caught the attention of explorers in the early of the twentieth century, with North American Colonel Charles Wellington Furlong the first to record phonograph records of Ona and Yagan songs between 1907 and 1908. German priest and ethnologist Martin Gusinde studied and recorded their music, and in a letter from July 23, 1923, wrote of ceremonies with music and dancing very similar to those observed in the Amazon, which he described as sad, solemn and very limited in tonal range.  Development of music in Chile  Chilean music is closely related with Chile's history and geography. The landscape, climate and lifestyle vary greatly from north to south and have a deep impact on cultural traditions. Popular music in the colonial period and during the struggle for independence was highly influenced by military bands and by the church. There were few musical instruments and very little opportunity to learn to play an instrument outside of military bands or churches if you were not from a wealthy family. Chilean huaso playing accordion ;Nineteenth century In the nineteenth century, with the end of the colonial period and the transition to an independent republic, music and other aspects of culture gradually began to acquire a national identity. During the first years of the republic, most of the leading musicians came from abroad. In 1823, a wave of professional musicians came to Chile, including: Bartolome Filomeno and Jose Bernardo Alzedo from Lima, Peru; Juan Cris√≥stomo Lafinur from C√≥rdoba, Argentina; and the Spaniard,Isidora Zegers y Montenegro (1803-1869) www.memoriachilena.cl Memoria Chilena - Algunos derechos reservados ‚Äì 2014, retrieved on September 18, 2014 one of the most important figures of Chilean music of this period. Having studied the harp, guitar, piano and singing with Federico Massimino in Europe, Isidora's superior musical knowledge was welcomed in the Chilean Tertulias (social gatherings of the wealthy, like a salon). She formally contributed to the development of Chilean music when she helped found both the first National Conservatory of Music and the Academy of Music in 1852. Some of the first opera and ballet performances in Chile also took place around this time. By the end of the nineteenth century, musical clubs and other private organisations had sprung up in Santiago, Concepci√≥n, Valpara√≠so, Valdivia and other cities, including: ‚ÄúClub Musical de Santiago‚Äù (Santiago, 1871), ‚ÄúSociedad Musical Reformada‚Äú (Valpara√≠so, 1881), ‚ÄúDeutscher Verein‚Äù (1853) and ‚ÄúClub de la Union‚Äù (Valdivia, 1879), ‚ÄúSociedad de Musical Clasica‚Äù (Santiago, 1879), and ‚ÄúSociedad Cuarteto‚Äù (Santiago, 1885). Some of the leading Chilean composers of the twentieth century were born at the end of the nineteenth century, including: Celerino Pereira Lecaros (1874), Prospero Bisquertt (1881), Carlos Lavin (1883), Javier Rengifo (1884), Alfonso Leng (1884), Enrique Soro Barriga (1884), Pedro Humberto Allende (1885), Carlos Isamit (1887), Acario Cotapos (1889), Armando Carvajal (1893), Samuel Negrete (1893), Roberto Puelma (1893), Juan Casanova Vicu√±a (1894) and Domingo Santa Cruz (1899).Violeta Parra An icon of Chilean folklore ;Twentieth century By the twentieth century Chile had established its own musical scene, but, as in most of the American countries, the national identity had struggled to assert itself in a world where European styles were still dominant. Composer says of the influence of European styles: ‚ÄúThe young American music is hill from aesthetic elements that hasn‚Äôt been digested‚Äù.\\"La joven muisica americana, escribio R. Falabella, esta enferma de alimentos esteticos que no se han asimilado\\" This had led to an almost complete disregard for native folklore and tradition. From 1900 onwards, music began to take a more central place in Chilean society. The first Chilean recording label, Fonograf√≠a Art√≠stica (which produced both cylinders and discs), began its functions in Santiago around 1908.http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-348773.html In 1912 the ‚ÄúOrchestral Society of Chile‚Äù was created and, over the next year, performed the nine symphonies of Beethoven, published the journal ‚ÄúLa Orquesta‚Äù (The Orchestra), and debuted performances of Bach. Influential families began to cultivate music and take part in the creation of music appreciation societies. Once these influential families got involved in the music scene, musicians‚Äô reputation in society started to change - previously seen as undesirable, they become to be viewed as an important part of culture, and having musical knowledge became essential for the cultured person. Around 1928, the Bach Society, a civil organization of musicians and intellectuals, began to harshly criticise formal music education in Chile, especially at the ‚ÄúConservatorio nacional‚Äù (National Conservatory). The society claimed that the number of students admitted to the conservatory was excessive and that the conservatory lacked long term planning, and criticised the cult of Italian opera as ‚Äúretrograde‚Äù. The Ministry of Education set up a commission to look at reforming the organization, which eventually led to a new stage in the development of music in Chile, with the creation of organizations dedicated to creating music, teaching music and supporting musicians and composers. Another institution that contributed to the development of music in Chile was the Universidad de Chile (University of Chile), when it created its High Arts Faculty in 1929. But even in 1802, long before the creation of the High Arts Faculty, there had been efforts within the institution to take the music culture and teaching to a highest level. In 1802, a group of professors from San Felipe University (which would later become the University of Chile) agreed that any teaching of music in their institution should be based not on the skills of musicians or the quality of a singer's voice, but instead on scientific and mathematical principles. The creation of the High Arts Faculty had an immediate effect. Soon after, a library was founded, a collection of albums produced, and several contests and activities held to promote Chilean musicians and composers. The second half of the twentieth century saw many events and new institutions that contributed to the development of music in Chile, such as: The creation of the ‚ÄúInstituto de extencion musical‚Äù, in 1940, which went on to found the (Chilean Symphonic Orchestra) in 1941, and the ‚ÄúRevista Musical Chilena‚Äù (Chilean Music Journal) in 1945. The creation of the ‚ÄúInstituto de investigacion folklorica‚Äù (the Institute of Folkloric Research) in 1943, which would become the ‚ÄúInstituto de investigacion musical‚Äù (Institute of Music Research). The institute would become very active in promoting Chilean music, sponsoring and funding many Chilean musicians and composers. In 1948, the High Arts Faculty split into a music and an art faculty, allowing both institutions to grow. The creation of the ‚ÄúOrquesta filarmonica de Chile‚Äù (Chilean Philharmonic Orchestra) in 1955, which later changed its name to ‚ÄúOrquesta filarmonica municipal‚Äù (Municipal Philharmonic Orchestra). Also in 1955, the ‚ÄúTaller experimental del sonido‚Äù (Experimental Sound Laboratory) was set up in the ‚ÄúUniversidad Catolica de Santiago‚Äù (Catholic University of Santiago). Following a visit to Chile by physicist Werner Meyer-Eppler in 1958, experimentation with electronic music got scientific support and work began on an electronic music laboratory. The ‚ÄúDepartamento de m√∫sica‚Äù (Music Department) at the ‚ÄúUniversidad Catolica de Santiago‚Äù (Catholic University of Santiago) was created in 1959. The university already had an Institute of Music and a chamber orchestra, and also recorded and released music albums. In the same year, Jose Visencio Asuar published a thesis entitled ‚ÄúGeneraci√≥n mec√°nica y electr√≥nica del sonido musical‚Äù (Mechanical and Electronic Generation of Musical Sound), and to demonstrate his thesis he composed ‚ÄúVariaciones espectrales‚Äù (Spectral Variations), the first piece of electronic music in Chile. In the 1960s, the trend continued and several institutions dedicated to promoting music were set up throughout the country, including the ‚ÄúAsociaci√≥n de Coros de Tarapaca‚Äù (Tarapaca Choirs Association) in the Tarapac√° Region and the ‚ÄúOrquesta de la Universidad Austral de Valdivia‚Äù (Austral University of Valdivia Orchestra). This university and its music conservatory have made a great contribution to music in the south of Chile 1961 saw the launch of the ‚ÄúFolkloric Weeks‚Äù, an event organized by the Institute of Music Research. The same year, the ‚ÄúOrquesta Cl√°sica Pro M√∫sica de Vi√±a del Mar‚Äù (Vi√±a del Mar Classical Music Orchestra) was born in Vi√±a del Mar, and in Antofagasta the ‚ÄúOrquesta Sinf√≥nica de la Universidad de Chile‚Äù (Symphony Orchestra of the University of Chile) was founded. In 1962, the Organization of American States and the Faculty of Science and Musical Arts created the ‚ÄúInstituto Interamericano de Educaci√≥n Musical‚Äù (Interamerican Institute of Musical Education). Between 1962 and 1968, Jose Visencio Asuar released several albums of electronic music in Germany (Karlsruhe) and Venezuela (Caracas), and Tom√°s Lefever composed 19 tracks in this genre. The University of Concepci√≥n created its ‚ÄúEscuela superior de m√∫sica‚Äù (Music College) in 1963, and in Lota, coal miners created the ‚ÄúCoro Polifonico de Lota‚Äù (Lota Polyphonic Choir). In La Serena in 1965, the Basic Music School was created, based on the experiences of the Children's Orchestra from the same city. The same year in Osorno, a Philharmonic Orchestra was created, along with a music college in the city's university. In 1966, the institute of music research released the first anthology album of Chilean folkloric music. In the same year, at the Universidad Catolica, Samuel Claro released his second electronic music album, ‚ÄúEstudio N¬∞1‚Äù. In 1967, the first electronic albums were released, with Asuar's ‚ÄúTres ambientes sonorous‚Äù (1967) and Amen√°bar's ‚ÄúKlesis‚Äù (1968). From 1966-1968, the education reforms led by the government caused a big impact on music education in schools, with more, better trained teachers required and new methods of study used. Around this time, in the second half of the 60s and first half of the 70s, the Nueva Canci√≥n Chilena (New Chilean Song) movement began to emerge with Violeta Parra's efforts to preserve over 3,000 Chilean songs, recipes, traditions, and proverbs. Other members of this movement included V√≠ctor Jara, Patricio Manns, Isabel Parra, √Ångel Parra, Osvaldo ‚ÄúGitano‚Äù Rodr√≠guez, and the bands Quilapay√∫n, Inti Illimani and Illapu. In 1969, the Music Department of the University of Chile in Antofagasta was created, and in 1970, the Symphony Orchestra of Chile performed the first televised concert broadcast via satellite, which was seen across almost all of the continent. The ‚ÄúOpera Nacional‚Äù (National Opera) was also founded under the ‚ÄúInstituto de Extencion Musical‚Äù and continuously incorporated national themes into their works. After the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat, music, like almost all forms of culture, suffered a major setback, especially popular music, due to the political affiliation of some musicians. In the 1980s, the generation that grew up under the military regime slowly began to recover some cultural ground from the supporters of the regime. Punk and rock were a means to express political discontent, and were used as a form of protest. During this time, some bands distribute their material via homemade cassettes, and by the end of the regime, bands like Los Prisioneros would gain international recognition. In the 1990s, Chile reconnected with the world and trends from Europe and the USA became part of Chile's popular culture. The national music industry that had almost disappeared during the military regime was reborn, and local branches of the big record labels attempted to promote local bands, with varying results.  Chilean folk music  = Northern Chilean folk music = Northern traditional music in the territories between the regions of Arica y Parinacota and Coquimbo has been highly influenced by Andean music and by the Quechua, Aymara, Atacama and other cultures who lived around the area occupied by the Inca Empire prior the European arrival. Other elements that influenced northern folklore included Spanish colonial military bands and the Catholic Church, due to the fact that both institutions had music as part of their ceremonies, and were therefore some of the only people who had musical instruments and the means to teach music methodically.M√∫sica Colonial en Chile e Iberoam√©rica http://www.memoriachilena.cl/ Memoria Chilena - Algunos derechos reservados ‚Äì 2014, retrieved on October 1, 2014 Traditional music has a dominant role in religious celebrations, which, in this zone of the country as in many other parts of the Americas, blends pre-Columbian and Christian forms of celebrating holy days. One example of this mixture is the Diabladas (Devil Dance) ritual, a colourful mix of dances and instrumental music. The La Tirana Festival, which takes place every July 16 in the town of La Tirana, is a fine example of both diabladas and Christian devotion. * Northern Chile music instruments ;Traditional musical instruments of northern Chile Some traditional musical instruments in this area were brought by the Spanish, while others are inherited from the native peoples. They include: * Quena (Quechua): Also known as ‚ÄúKena‚Äù, this is the traditional flute of the Andes. Traditionally made of totora, it has six finger holes and one thumb hole. * Zampo√±a: The siku (, , also \\"sicu,\\" \\"sicus,\\" \\"zampolla\\" or Spanish zampo√±a), is a traditional Andean panpipe. This is the main instrument used in a musical genre known as sikuri. It is traditionally found all across the Andes but is more typically associated with music from the Kollasuyo, or Aymara speaking regions around Lake Titicaca. * Ocarina: This is a common instrument around the world. In the Americas, it dates from the time of the Incas and is used for festivals, rituals and ceremonies in some areas of the Arica y Parinacota and Tarapac√° regions. Ocarinas in this part of the world are made of clay with 8‚Äì9 holes, sometimes shaped like an animal. * Charango: The charango is a small Andean stringed instrument of the lute family. It originated in Quichua and Aymara populations in post-Columbian times, after the Americas came across the European stringed instruments, and survives in what are today the Andean regions of Bolivia, Peru, north of Chile and the northwest of Argentina, where it is widespread as a popular music instrument.Algunas aproximaciones conciliatorias en relaci√≥n al origen e historia del charango www.charango.cl Ector Soto Copyright ¬© 1999 Charango para todos.

It is used in most of the religious and pagan ceremonies. =Central Chilean folk music= The \\"Valle central\\" (Central Valley) is the extension of land that runs from the Chacabuco mountain range, which separates the Aconcagua and Maipo Valleys in the north of the Valparaiso region, to the Bio Bio river. The folklore in central Chile, as in southern Chile, is closely linked to rural life and Spanish heritage. The most iconic figure is the Huaso, a countryman and skilled horseman, similar to the American cowboy, Mexican charro or the gaucho of Argentina. In Central Chile, the cueca and tonada dances and songs are the most characteristic styles. In this area of the country the most popular instruments are the accordion (introduced by the German immigrants through the south), guitar, harp, tambourine and the tormento, a Chilean instrument of colonial times used in the salon parties or ‚Äútertulias‚Äù, similar to a xylophone. Among the other dances and music that are part of central Chilean folklore are the \\"Sajuriana\\", originally from Argentina, \\"the Refalosa\\" introduced from the north, and the \\"Vals\\", inherited from Europe and very popular during the first half of the nineteenth century among the upper classes.

It first appeared in 1824, though its origins are not clear. Since September 18, 1979, cueca has been affirmed as the official national dance. Cueca is written in a combination of 6/8 and 3/4 at the same time and has a very rigid structure that is divided into three sections: the ‚Äúcuarteta‚Äù, which contains four verses in eight syllables with rhymes in the second and fourth verses; the ‚Äúseguidilla‚Äù; and the ‚Äúremate‚Äù.

The instruments used to perform it here include some of Andean origin, like sicus, zampo√±as and brass (trumpets and tubas). In the central regions, the cueca has lyrics and the instruments most commonly used to perform it are the guitar, tambourine, accordion and bombo. On the island of Chiloe, the main difference in cueca consists of the absence of the initial ‚Äúcuarteta‚Äù. The verses of the seguidilla are repeated and there is a greater emphasis placed on the interpretation of the lyrics by the singer rather than on the music or the dance. Cueca brava (urban cueca) is a variation of the cueca that originated in the 1860s in the rougher neighbourhoods of cities, where it was sung and danced in places like bars and brothels. ;Tonada The Tonada is another important form of Chilean traditional song, arising from the music brought by Spanish settlers. It is not danced and is distinguished from the cueca by an intermediate melodic section and a more prominent melody in general. Several groups have taken the tonada as their main form of expression, such as Los Huasos Quincheros, Los Huasos de Algarrobal, Los de Ramon and others. The modern rural tonada is typically simple and \\"monotonous\\", as described by Raquel Barros y Manuel Dannemann.Raquel Barros y Manuel Dannemann El romancero chileno 1970Juan Eduardo Wolf La tonada Chilena: the history of a musical genre through performance 2007 \\"Employing one of the classic descriptions of a tonada, Barros and Dannemann state that the melody of a tonada is simple and monotonous.

Typical music and dances include: * ‚ÄúPericona‚Äù One of the most popular dances among Chilotes, this is danced by two loose couples, handkerchiefs in hands.

Music, Politics, and Nationalism in Latin America: Chile During the Cold War Era. Cambria Press, 2014. In a period of political struggle across Latin America, the ‚ÄúNueva Canci√≥n‚Äù became associated with political activism and reformers like the Chilean Salvador Allende and his Popular Unity government. It soon emerged in other countries like Argentina, where the movement was called ‚ÄúNuevo Cancionero‚Äù and was led by Mercedes Sosa and Armando Tejada G√≥mez among others. The foundations of the movement were laid through the efforts of Violeta Parra to revive over 3,000 Chilean songs, recipes, traditions, proverbs and folkloric characters, like the payadores (improviser-singers). Violeta Parra, and artists like her, acted as a vehicle for a folkloric tradition that otherwise would have remained unknown for many Chileans in the cities. Violeta Parra and her brothers paved the way for other key Chilean folkloric artists like Rolando Alarc√≥n, Payo Grondona, Patricio Castillo, Homero Caro, Tito Fern√°ndez, Kiko √Ålvarez, Patricio Manns and V√≠ctor Jara. Jara emerged as one of the major voices of the Nueva Canci√≥n and began its traditions of criticising government officials and policies. Since September 1973, the new military government of Augusto Pinochet threatened Nueva Canci√≥n artists, driving them underground during the 1970s. Cassette tapes of artists like Inti-Illimani and Quilapay√∫n were circulated in a clandestine manner. The groups continued to oppose Pinochet's government from exile, and helped inspire Nueva Canci√≥n singers from Uruguay (Daniel Viglietti), El Salvador (Yolocamba l'ta), Guatemala (Kin-Lalat), Mexico (Amparo Ochoa), Nicaragua (Carlos Goodys and Lu√≠s Enrique Mej√≠a Godoy), as well as Cuban Nueva Trova artists like Pablo Milan√©s. Popular music = Rock and roll = Rock and roll music was first produced in Chile in the late 1950s by bands that imitated and were inspired by international rock and roll hits from the U.S., often translating these songs for the Chilean market. This movement was known as the Nueva Ola (New Wave).Nueva Ola www.musicapopular.cl. Retrieved 24 February 2013.Rock chileno www.memoriachilena.cl. Retrieved 24 February 2013. During the second half of the 1960s, after the success of rock and roll music, the Fusi√≥n latinoamericana (Latin American fusion) and Nueva Canci√≥n (New Song) genres were born in Chile, bringing together rock and roll and Latin American folk music. Los Jaivas are an example of this fusion between the two convergent styles. In the 1970s, however, the country's rock scene declined due to political repressionMorris, Nancy. 1986. Canto Porque es Necesario Cantar: The New Song Movement in Chile, 1973-1983. Latin American Research Review, Vol. 21, pp. 117-136. The 1980s saw the beginning of a revival of rock music in Chile which has continued until the modern day, with the growth of many rock subgenres and many Chilean bands finding success on the international market in recent years. Some of the most successful Chilean rock bands are: Los Prisioneros, Lucybell, La Ley, Javiera Mena, Francisca Valenzuela, Los Jaivas, Los Tres, Chancho en Piedra, Panico, Sol y Lluvia, Nicole (Chilean singer), Los Miserables, Buddy Richard. = Hip hop and rap = Since the mid to late 1980s, hip hop music have had a considerable influence on the Chilean music scene and culture. People of Chile had their first contact with this genre through the television and radio. First to appear and gain popularity were Breakdance and breakers groups: ‚ÄúMonta√±a Breakers‚Äù, ‚ÄúB14‚Äù, ‚ÄúT.N.T.‚Äù, ‚ÄúFloor Masters‚Äù. Breakers from all over the capital would gather in Bombero Ossa Street in Central Santiago to share music and have breakdance ‚Äúbattles‚Äù.Hip hop and rap history (ES) Chilerap blogspot.co.uk Then came the first Chilean rap groups, such as ‚ÄúLos Marginales‚Äù and ‚ÄúPanteras Negras‚Äù. The return of immigrants after the end of the dictatorship could also have been a factor that increased the popularity of hip hop and rap, with examples such as Jimmy Fernandez (ex La Pozze Latina) returning from Italy, or ‚ÄúFloor Masters‚Äù front man who came from Los Angeles. However, it wasn't until the mid-1990s that hip hop gained mainstream popularity with successful groups such as Tiro de Gracia, MC Rode, Los Tetas, Makiza, Zaturno and La Pozze Latina. Commercial success was confirmed in 1997, when ‚ÄúTiro de Gracia‚Äù and ‚ÄúMakiza‚Äù got Golden and Silver Discs and filled venues along the country. During the 2000s, some bands connected hip hop with other styles like dancehall, reggae, and Latin rhythms. Also in the 2000s, political rap became popular, with groups like, ‚ÄúPanteras Negras‚Äù, ‚ÄúLB1‚Äù, ‚ÄúSubverso‚Äù, ‚ÄúGuerrillerokulto‚Äù and ‚ÄúSalvaje Decibel‚Äù. Como Asesinar a Felipes is the first Experimental hip hop band that has achieved a considerable success, being produced by Koolarrow Records. Most recently, Chilean rapper Ana Tijoux (formerly of Makiza) has become one of the most successful rap artists, collaborating with Mexican musician Julieta Venegas and having tracks featured on the EA Sports video game FIFA 11. Her music has appeared in the popular TV series Breaking Bad (season 4, episode 5). = Chilean electronic music = The electronic music movement as we know it today reached Chile in the 1990s, but there are some earlier milestones worth mentioning, like the sound experiments of engineer and scientist Jose Visencio Asuar in 1959 after the 1958 visit of physicist Werner Meyer-Eppler, and the production of the first electronically generated music records in the 1960s. ‚ÄúElectronica‚Äù has given Chile more international success than any other style of music; Chilean DJs and electronic music producers are among the most important in the international scene. Many Chilean DJs are based in Europe, particularly in Germany. Some were children of political exiles while others moved to Europe to develop their careers and then stayed following their great success. Some of the most important and best known electronic music artists are: Ricardo Villalobos, Andr√©s Bucci, Cristian Vogel, Latin Bitman, Danieto, Luciano, Pier Bucci, Nicolas Jaar and Jorge Gonz√°lez. = Chilean cumbia = Cumbia style has its origins in the caribbean climates of Colombia, Venezuela and Panama, and was introduced to Chile in the mid 1960s by the Venezuelan Luis√≠n Land√°ez.Luis√≠n Land√°ez retrieved October 1, 2014 Later in the same decade, Colombian musician Amparito Jim√©nez would record and release albums in Chile and had great success with the song ‚ÄúLa pollera colora‚Äù, one of the most emblematic Colombian songs. Later, the Chilean band Sonora Palacios would bring cumbia to mass popularity among the Chilean population.Sonora Palacios ‚Äì Biograf√≠a (ES) www.musicapopular.cl Memoria Chilena - Algunos derechos reservados - 2014retrieved on September 21, 2014 Since the beginning, Chile has developed its own kind of cumbia known as \\"cumbia sonora\\" or just \\"traditional Chilean cumbia\\", with long standing orchestras such as Orquesta Huambaly, La Sonora de Tommy Rey, Sonora Palacios, Los Vikings 5, Giolito y su combo and Pachuco y la Cubanac√°n. These have been some of the most popular acts in the last 50 years and still enjoy mainstream popularity, seen as part of Chile's musical culture and identity. Chilean cumbia added brass instruments, piano and a faster percussion to the original cumbia style. The process of adaptation and evolution created a sub style that can be easily identified from the original. Chilean cumbia bands are called ‚ÄúCombos‚Äù, ‚ÄúSonoras‚Äù or simply ‚ÄúOrquestas‚Äù (orchestras) and are formed by 10 or more musicians where the brass and the drums have an important role. Cumbia developed this orchestral performance style in the 1960s, adapting from the tropical orchestras that had played rhythms such as the cha-cha-cha, mambo, rumba, bolero, and merengue in the 1920‚Äì1940s. Some subgenres that were not originally from Chile also became popular in the country: In the 1990s, cumbia sound, known in other countries of Latin America as Technocumbia, is a style of dumbia where there is a fusion between electronic sounds generated by electronic drums, and electric guitar. \\"Technocumbia\\" was a name given to the subgenre in Mexico to describe this type of music. However, the style was developed throughout South America with different names: ‚ÄúSound‚Äù in Chile and ‚ÄúCumbia Villera‚Äù in Argentina. In the 2000s, Cumbia rom√°ntica emerged, a style where great emphasis was placed on the (usually romantic) lyrics and where the artists can be a solo male or female singer rather than a band. Unlike Technocumbia, cumbia romantica arrangements tend to be acoustic. Some performers in this subgenre are La Noche and Am√©rico). Also in the 2000s, a style called New Chilean cumbia or ‚ÄúCumbia Rock‚Äù emerged, led by bands like (Chico Trujillo, La Mano Ajena, and Juana Fe). This new Chilean cumbia is highly influenced by rock and some hip hop groups, although in some cases the influence of Andean music, Balkan music Klezmer, Salsa and Bolero can be heard. It main exponents are Chico Trujillo, Banda Conmoci√≥n, Juana Fe, La Mano Ajena, Cholomandinga, Villa Cari√±o, Combo Ginebra, etc. =Mexican music in Chile=  Chilean Jazz  La Marraqueta in the Festival Internacional Providencia Jazz 2017 The practice of jazz is one of the most popular manifestations of popular music in Chile. The most regular tracks appear towards the 1920s around the figure of the composer, violinist and researcher Pablo Garrido, manager of the first ensembles and local jazz orchestras. From 1940, a new generation of young musicians aligned themselves with jazz improvisation beyond the predecessor jazz, which they considered commercial, baptizing it hot jazz. This would result in the founding of the Club de Jazz de Santiago in 1943 and the formation of the first national all-stars, The Chilean Aces of Jazz, in 1944 and 1945. Modern jazz broke into the 1960s at the initiative of the pianist Omar Nahuel, at the head of the Nahuel Jazz Quartet. The band was not only a pioneer in the development of new jazz forms, such as bebop or cool, but also brought together enthusiastic musicians of the figure of Charlie Parker and his descendants. In the 1970s, as in the rest of the world, the electric jazz installed a new expressive form and gave rise to new soloists in Chile. Since the 1980s, jazz has had in Chile the possibility of training professional musicians thanks to the creation of ProJazz, the Escuela Moderna de M√∫sica and the School of Music of the SCD, which has allowed the development of the jazz language during the following decades. With the creation of the Festival Internacional Providencia Jazz in the year 2002, along with other communal festivals, jazz has achieved greater diffusion for the non-expert public in the 21st century. Currently, the national scene stands out for the multiplicity of styles, among which stand out: the group La Marraqueta in the avant-garde of the so-called jazz criollo, a wide variety of groups in the Latin American fusion, and the big bands, such as the Conchal√≠ Big Band or Los Andes Big Band, in the traditional jazz as bebop or the swing. Among the figures of contemporary Chilean jazz stand out: Jorge Vera, Ricardo Arancibia, Mariano Casanova, Cristi√°n Cuturrufo, Federico Dannemann, Sebasti√°n Jord√°n, Mario Feito, Christian G√°lvez, Pedro Greene, Martin Joseph, Ronnie Knoller, the Lecaros Family; Mario Lecaros, Pablo Lecaros, Roberto Lecaros, Agust√≠n Moya, Gonzalo Palma, √Ångel Parra Orrego, Andr√©s P√©rez, Lautaro Quevedo, Felipe Riveros, Carla Romero, Moncho Romero, Melisa Aldana, Miguel Sacaan and Nicol√°s Vera, Jos√© Gil, Antonio Lambertini and the groups La Marraqueta, Contracuarteto, Los Titulares, Holman Tr√≠o, Caravana Tr√≠o and Ensemble Quintessence, among many others. Academic music Claudio Arrau, a great pianist of the 20th century Since the beginning of the Chilean republic, the need for highly trained musicians in educational institutions and in the classical music scene was evident. Initially, this need was fulfilled by artists coming from nearby Rio de la Plata, Argentina (Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata) and Peru (Viceroyalty of Peru), both former important viceroyalties of Spain. In 1823, a wave of professional musicians came to Chile, including: Bartolome Filomeno and Jose Bernardo Alzedo from Lima, Peru; Juan Cris√≥stomo Lafinur from C√≥rdoba, Argentina; and the Spaniard, From 1900 onwards, music began to take a more central place in Chilean society. In 1912 the ‚ÄúOrchestral Society of Chile‚Äù was created and, over the next year, performed the nine symphonies of Beethoven, published the journal ‚ÄúLa Orquesta‚Äù (The Orchestra), and debuted performances of Bach. Once the influential families got involved in the music scene, musicians‚Äô reputation in society started to change - previously seen as undesirable, or just entertainers, they started to be viewed as an important part of culture, and having musical knowledge became essential for the cultured person. The most prolific period of classic music in Chile began in the 1950s, with the founding of several projects aiming to educate, promote and research music, along with the implementation of educational reforms and the foundation of Youth and Children's Orchestras - like that created in the city of La Serena, led by conductor and composerFOJI Historia (ES) http://www.orquestajuvenilchile.com FOJI retrieved on October 8, 2014 Jorge Pe√±a Hen. This process continued until 1973 when political repression hit culture and music across the board. The music industry, live performances, the media, and even musical education were affected, with musical education officially suppressed as a mandatory high school subject.Situacion de la m√∫sica cl√°sica en Chile (ES) Situaci√≥n de la m√∫sica cl√°sica en Chile.

The festival take place between January and February every year, and consists of 40 or more classical concerts performed by both Chilean and international artists. The construction of a new venue, the Teatro del Lago (Lake Theatre) which opened in 2010, has given the festival a boost, providing space for more performances and larger audiences. Since the 1990s, classical music has slowly recovered its place in Chilean culture and education, with projects like ‚ÄúFOJI‚Äù (the Foundation for Youth and Children's Orchestras), a non-profit organization that works to form orchestras and educate young people in several cities around Chile. Their programme reaches more than 12,000 teens and children every year, and their orchestras perform concerts that reach an audience of almost a million.Fundaci√≥n de Orquestas Juveniles e Infantiles (ES) FOJI retrieved on October 8, 2014 Among the best known Chilean classical composers are Jos√© Zapiola Cort√©s, Enrique Soro and Pedro Humberto Allende. Allende put special effort to include some elements of Chilean tradition and folklore in his work, with works such as the symphonic poem ‚ÄúLa Voz de las Calles‚Äù (The Voice of the Streets); ‚ÄúDoce Tonadas para Piano‚Äù (Twelve Tunes for Piano); and the ‚ÄúConcierto Sinf√≥nico para Violoncello y Orquesta‚Äù (Symphonic Concerto for Cello and Orchestra), whose rhythmic richness was praised by Claude Debussy. Other important Chilean composers include Vicente Bianchi known for his compositions based on Pablo Neruda poems; Alfonso Leng, one of the most influential Chilean classical composers with a mystic and romantic style influenced by Wagnerian Post-romanticism; Luis Advis Vitaglich, known by his work (‚ÄúCantata de Santa Maria de Iquique‚Äù); Carlos Riesco; Domingo Santa Cruz Wilson; Roberto Falabella Correa; Nina Frick Ajenjo; Carlos Isamitt; Juan Orrego-Salas; Alfonso Letelier; Gustavo Becerra-Schmidt; Sergio Ortega; Leon Schidlowsky; Leni Alexander; Fernando Garc√≠a; Juan Allende-Blin; Cirilo Vila; Santiago Vera-Rivera; Andr√©s Alcalde; Ren√© Amengual; Pr√≥spero Bisquertt; Gabriel Brncic; Salvador Candiani; Acario Cotapos; Alejandro Guarello; Hans Helfritz; Mar√≠a Elena Hurtado; Tom√°s Lefever; Eduardo Maturana; Claudio Spies; Jorge Urrutia Blondel and Darwin Vargas, among many others.

Andean influences can perhaps be best heard in wind instruments and the shape of the melodies, while the African influences can be heard in the rhythm and percussion instruments, and European influences can be heard in the harmonies and stringed instruments. Pre- Columbian Andean music was played on drums and string instruments, like the European pipe and tabor tradition. Andean tritonic and pentatonic scales were elaborated during the colonial period into hexatonic, and in some cases, diatonic scales. History Yma Sumac Stories published in the 1950s claimed that she was an Incan princess, directly descended from Atahualpa. The earliest printed polyphonic music in Peru, indeed anywhere in the Americas, was \\"Hanacpachap cussicuinin,\\" composed or collected by Juan P√©rez Bocanegra and printed in 1631. Instruments =Stringed instruments= Peruvian music is dominated by the national instrument, the charango. The charango is member of the lute family of instruments and was invented during the Viceroyalty of Peru by musicians imitating the Spanish vihuela. In the Canas and Titicaca regions, the charango is used in courtship rituals, symbolically invoking mermaids with the instrument to lure the woman to the male performers. Until the 1960s, the charango was denigrated as an instrument of the rural poor. After the revolution in 1959, which built upon the Indigenismo movement (1910-1940), the charango was popularized among other performers. Variants include the walaycho, chillador, chinlili, and the larger and lower-tuned charangon. While the Spanish guitar is widely played, so too is the Spanish- in-origin bandurria. Unlike the guitar, it has been transformed by Peruvian players over the years, changing from a 12-string, 6-course instrument to one having 12 to 16 strings in a mere 4 courses. Violins and harps, also of European origin, are also played. =Percussion instruments= The caj√≥n is an important percussion instrument developed by African slaves. People imply the cowbell may also be of African origin. While the rhythms played on them are often African-influenced, some percussive instruments are of non-African origin. For example, of European origin is the bombo, and of Andean origin are the wankara and tinya respectively. =Wind instruments= In addition to the ocarina and waqra phuku, there are Peruvian wind instruments of two basic types, panpipes and flutes, both of Native Andean origin and built to play tritonic, pentatonic and hexatonic scales, though some contemporary musicians play instruments designed to play European diatonic scales. Of the former variety, there are the siku (or zampo√±a) and antara. Of the latter variety, there are the pinkillu, tarka, and quena (qina) flutes.

It was one of the first books openly to discuss birth control. The book begins by stating that 'More than ever to-day are happy homes needed. It is my hope that this book may serve the State by adding to their number. Its object is to increase the joys of marriage, and to show how much sorrow may be avoided'. The preface states that a book geared to teaching married couples how to have a happy marriage, including 'great sex' \\\\- and it was thus offering a service to 'the State' by reducing the number of people affected by failed marriages. The central question is how can the ‚Äúdesire for freedom‚Äù and ‚Äúphysical and mental exploration‚Äù be balanced with the limits of monogamy and raising a family. The answer is not ‚Äúin the freedom to wander at will‚Äù but a ‚Äúfull and perfected love‚Äù. In Stopes' lexicography love means sex and ‚Äúaccess to the knowledge of how to cultivate it‚Äù.  Publishing history  It was first published in March 1918 by a small publisher, after many other larger publishers turned her down because of its controversial content. It rapidly sold out, and was in its sixth printing within a fortnight. The US Customs Service banned the book as obscene until April 6, 1931, when Judge John M. Woolsey overturned that decision. Woolsey was the same judge who in 1933 would lift the ban on James Joyce's Ulysses, allowing for its publication and circulation in the United States of America. It was the first book to note that women's sexual desire coincides with ovulation and the period right before menstruation. The book argued that marriage should be an equal relationship between partners. Although officially scorned in the UK, the book went through 19 editions and sales of almost 750,000 copies by 1931. In 1935 a survey of American academics said Married Love was one of the 25 most influential books of the previous 50 years, ahead of Relativity by Albert Einstein, Interpretation of Dreams by Sigmund Freud, Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler and The Economic Consequences of the Peace by John Maynard Keynes.

It is on the Princes Highway about south of Sydney, halfway between Batemans Bay to the south and Nowra to the north. Ulladulla has close links with the nearby historic settlement of Milton and many services are shared between these towns. The name Ulladulla is the modern spelling of an Aboriginal word, the meaning of which is unknown. Some records show the name meaning \\"safe harbour\\" but local Aboriginal Elders dispute the meaning and point out that a harbour for boats is a modern idea. The name was corrupted to \\"Holy Dollar\\" at one time. Alternative spellings as Woolladoorh or Ngulla-dulla have been recorded. The first white Settler was Rev Thomas Kendall in 1828 who started cedar cutting at Narrawallee Creek near Milton. Geography The Ulladulla area is a seven-kilometre stretch of continuous urban residential development from the southern edge of Ulladulla, through the town of Mollymook, to Narrawallee in the north, terminating at the Narrawallee estuary. At the , the population of the Ulladulla-Milton area, including some rural areas, was 15,278, having grown from 14,149 at the , an increase of 8 percent over the preceding five years. At the 2016 census, the population of the Ulladulla-Milton built up area was 13,054 and the population of the suburb of Ulladulla was 6,615. Ulladulla is surrounded by the adjoining towns of Milton and Burrill Lake as well as Mollymook and Narrawallee. The extended area from Burrill Lake to Milton is referred to as the Milton-Ulladulla area. Close landmarks include Pigeon House Mountain and \\"The Castle\\", both named due to the unique shapes of the mountain. Pigeon House was sighted by Captain James Cook upon his journey along the eastern shores of Australia. Pigeon House has recently been renamed \\"Didhol\\" out of respect to the elders of the Yuin nation, the Aboriginal elders past and present who originated from the area Ulladulla was built upon. The traditional name of the peak, Didhol, means \\"woman's breast\\", from the mountain's clear resemblance to the shape of a woman's breast. =Climate= Along with the rest of the NSW South Coast, Ulladulla has a mild oceanic climate (Cfb) and experiences lukewarm summers and mild winters. The climate is influenced by the warm waters of the adjacent Tasman Sea and is characteristically mild without extreme high or low temperatures. Climatic data has been recorded at Ulladulla by the Bureau of Meteorology since 1989. Ulladulla Harbour Small pleasure boats moored in Ulladulla Harbour. Ulladulla Harbour is a minor port administered by Land and Property Management Authority. The first white Settler was Rev Thomas Kendall in 1828 who started cedar cutting at Narrawallee Creek near Milton. A wooden jetty was built in 1859 so as to retain the services of the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company; the company had informed the farmers that would not call again at Ulladulla unless better mooring facilities were provided. After seven years the jetty was replaced by a stone pier built by the government on the natural reef. The company built a store on the harbour foreshores for the receiving of produce for shipment to and from Sydney. There was a weekly cargo service to Ulladulla until the mid-1950s. In 1873, a lighthouse was constructed on the harbour breakwater, and it was known at the time as the Ulladulla Lighthouse. It was relocated in 1889 to Warden Head, south of the harbour, where it is still active. During the mid-1890s, a 4 ft (1220 mm) gauge tramway was laid out to the end of the main stone wharf. Manpower and horses were used to move the low wagons. During the period 1910‚Äì11, a double line of track was laid to the end of the pier. Public Works Department records disclose maintenance of track and repair of wagons at least to 1947‚Äì48. Almost all trace of the line had gone by 1991.The Ulladulla Harbour Tramway Longworth, Jim Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, July 1994 pp 196-199 The harbour is the home port of the largest commercial fishing fleet on the South Coast of New South Wales.http://www.mynrma.com.au/cps/rde/xchg/mynrma/hs.xsl/south_coast_ulladulla.htm Retrieved 2008-09-19 =Blessing of the Fleet festival= The Blessing of the Fleet festival has been held regularly at Easter since 1956. This is a centuries-old tradition which originated in Sicily, Italy, and has been continued by the area's descendants of the original Italian immigrant fishing community. A significant element of the festival is the religious Blessing of the Fleet ceremony held at Ulladulla Harbour on Easter Sunday. The festivities conclude with fireworks display, over the harbour on Easter Sunday and the Harbour Markets on Easter Monday. Although the accompanying celebration was canceled due to a sharp rise in the public liability premium in 2004 and 2005, the ceremony returned in 2008.

She is the first Puritan figure in American Literature and notable for her large corpus of poetry, as well as personal writings published posthumously. Born to a wealthy Puritan family in Northampton, England, Bradstreet was a well-read scholar especially affected by the works of Du Bartas. Married at 16, her parents and young family migrated at the time of the founding of Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630. A mother of eight children and the wife and daughter of a public officials in New England, Bradstreet wrote poetry in addition to her other duties. Her early works read in the style of Du Bartas, but her later writings develop into her unique style of poetry which centers on her role as a mother, her struggles with the sufferings of life, and her Puritan faith. Her first collection, The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America, was widely read in America and England. Background In a portrait that was painted by her later poems, Bradstreet is described as 'an educated English woman, a kind, loving wife, devoted mother, Empress Consort of Massachusetts, a questing Puritan and a sensitive poet.'Langlin, Rosemary .M ' Anne Bradstreet:Poet in search of a Form ' American Literature vol 42 no. 1 Duke University Press Mer1970 Bradstreet's first volume of poetry was The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America, published in 1650. It was met with a positive reception in both the Old World and the New World.De Grave, Kathleen. \\"Anne Bradstreet\\". The Literary Encyclopedia. First published 31 May 2006 accessed 29 April 2012.Nichols, Heidi, Anne Bradstreet P&R; Publishing, Philipsburg, 2006 =Life= Anne was born in Northampton, England, 1612, the daughter of Thomas Dudley, a steward of the Earl of Lincoln, and Dorothy Yorke. Due to her family's position, she grew up in cultured circumstances and was a well- educated woman for her time, being tutored in history, several languages, and literature. At the age of sixteen she married Simon Bradstreet. Both Anne's father and husband were later to serve as governors of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Anne and Simon, along with Anne's parents, emigrated to America aboard the Arbella as part of the Winthrop Fleet of Puritan emigrants in 1630.Woodlief, A. (n.d.). Biography of Anne Bradstreet. Retrieved September 1, 2006. She first felt American soil on June 14, 1630, at what is now Pioneer Village (Salem, Massachusetts) with Simon, her parents, and other voyagers as part of the Puritan migration to New England (1620‚Äì1640). Due to the illness and starvation of Gov. John Endecott and other residents of the village, their stay was very brief. Most moved immediately south along the coast to Charlestown, Massachusetts, for another short stay before moving south along the Charles River to found \\"the City on the Hill,\\" Boston, Massachusetts. The Bradstreet family soon moved again, this time to what is now Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1632, Anne had her first child, Samuel, in Newe Towne, as it was then called. Despite poor health, she had eight children and achieved a comfortable social standing. Having previously been afflicted with smallpox as a teenager in England, Anne would once again fall prey to illness as paralysis overtook her joints in later years. In the early 1640s, Simon once again pressed his wife, pregnant with her sixth child, to move for the sixth time, from Ipswich, Massachusetts, to Andover Parish. North Andover is that original town founded in 1646 by the Stevens, Osgood, Johnson, Farnum, Barker, and Bradstreet families among others. Anne and her family resided in the Old Center of North Andover, Massachusetts . They never lived in what is now known as \\"Andover\\" to the south. Both Anne's father and her husband were instrumental in the founding of Harvard in 1636. Two of her sons were graduates, Samuel (Class of 1653) and Simon (Class of 1660). In October 1997, the Harvard community dedicated a gate in memory of her as America's first published poet (see last paragraph below). The Bradstreet Gate is located next to Canaday Hall, the newest dormitory in Harvard Yard. Memorial marker for Anne Bradstreet in the Old North Parish Burial Ground, North Andover, Massachusetts In 1650, Rev. John Woodbridge had The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America composed by \\"A Gentlewoman from Those Parts\\" published in London, making Anne the first female poet ever published in both England and the New World. On July 10, 1666, their North Andover family home burned (see \\"Works\\" below) in a fire that left the Bradstreets homeless and with few personal belongings. By then, Anne's health was slowly failing. She suffered from tuberculosis and had to deal with the loss of cherished relatives. But her will remained strong and as a reflection of her religious devotion and knowledge of Biblical scriptures, she found peace in the firm belief that her daughter-in-law Mercy and her grandchildren were in heaven. Anne Bradstreet died on September 16, 1672, in North Andover, Massachusetts, at the age of 60 of tuberculosis. The precise location of her grave is uncertain but many historians believe her body is in the Old Burying Ground at Academy Road and Osgood Street in North Andover. In 1676, four years after the death of Anne, Simon Bradstreet married for a second time to a lady also named Anne (Gardiner). In 1697 Simon died and was buried in Salem. This area of the Merrimack Valley is today described as \\"The Valley of the Poets.\\" A marker in the North Andover cemetery commemorates the 350th anniversary (2000) of the publishing of The Tenth Muse in London in 1650. That site and the Bradstreet Gate at Harvard, the memorial and pamphlets inside the Ipswich Public Library in Ipswich, MA, as well as the Bradstreet Kindergarten in North Andover may be the only places in America honoring her memory. As of 2015, the Bradstreet Kindergarten was torn down in North Andover. In the fall of 2018, The Anne Bradstreet Early Childhood Center was opened near Massachusetts Avenue in North Andover. Housing both preschool and kindergarten, the Anne Bradstreet ECC replaced the aged building named for her that had been on Main Street.  Writing  =Background= Anne Bradstreet's education gave her advantages that allowed her to write with authority about politics, history, medicine, and theology. Her personal library of books was said to have numbered over 9000, although many were destroyed when her home burned down. This event itself inspired a poem titled \\"Upon the Burning of Our House July 10th, 1666\\". At first, she rejects the anger and grief that this worldly tragedy has caused her;she looks toward God and the assurance of heaven as consolation, saying: However, in opposition to her Puritan ways, she also shows her human side, expressing the pain this event had caused her, that is, until the poem comes to its end: Title page, second (posthumous) edition of Bradstreet's poems, 1678 As a younger poet, Bradstreet wrote five quaternions, epic poems of four parts each (see works below) that explore the diverse yet complementary natures of their subject.Nichols, Heidi Anne Bradstreet, P&R; Publishing, Phillipsburg,2006 ISNBN 978-0-87552-610-2 Much of Bradstreet's poetry is based on observation of the world around her, focusing heavily on domestic and religious themes, and was considered by Cotton Mather a monument to her memory beyond the stateliest marble.Cotton Mather,The Great Works of Christ in America, Banner of Truth (reprinted ) 1979 Long considered primarily of historical interest, she won critical acceptance in the 20th century as a writer of enduring verse, particularly for her sequence of religious poems \\"Contemplations\\", which was written for her family and not published until the mid-19th century.n. a. (2000). Anne (Dudley) Bradstreet. The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia. Retrieved September 1, 2006. Bradstreet's work was deeply influenced by the poet Guillaume de Salluste Du Bartas, who was favored by 17th-century readers. Nearly a century later, Martha Wadsworth Brewster, a notable 18th-century American poet and writer, in her principal work, Poems on Diverse Subjects, was influenced and pays homage to Bradstreet's verse. Despite the traditional attitude toward women of the time, she clearly valued knowledge and intellect; she was a free thinker and some consider her an early feminist; unlike the more radical Anne Hutchinson, however, Bradstreet's feminism does not reflect heterodox, antinomian views. Based on her poems, Bradstreet could also be considered to be a complementarian. An example of this is in her poem \\"In Honour of that High and Mighty Princess Queen Elizabeth of Happy Memory\\", in which she praises Queen Elizabeth as proof that the common perceptions men held about women were wrong. She tends to focus on Elizabeth's ability to excel in more masculine areas, such as war, as we see in the lines below. In 1647 Bradstreet's brother-in-law, Rev. John Woodbridge, sailed to England, carrying her manuscript of poetry. Although Anne later said that she did not know Woodbridge was going to publish her manuscript, in her self-deprecatory poem, \\"\\"The Author to Her Book\\"\\", she wrote Woodbridge a letter while he was in London, indicating her knowledge of the publication plan. Anne had little choice, however‚Äî as a woman poet, it was important for her to downplay her ambitions as an author. Otherwise, she would have faced criticism for being \\"unwomanly.\\"Gordon, Charlotte. Mistress Bradstreet: The Untold Story of America's First Poet. New York: Little, Brown, 2005. 240-252 Anne's first work was published in London as The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America \\"by a Gentlewoman of those Parts\\". Title page, The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America, printed at London, 1650 The purpose of the publication appears to have been an attempt by devout Puritan men (i.e. Thomas Dudley, Simon Bradstreet, John Woodbridge) to show that a godly and educated woman could elevate her position as a wife and mother, without necessarily placing her in competition with men. In 1678 her self-revised Several Poems Compiled with Great Variety of Wit and Learning was posthumously published in America, and included one of her most famous poems, \\"To My Dear and Loving Husband\\".Ellis, J. H. (1867). The Works of Anne Bradstreet in Prose and Verse. This volume is owned by the Stevens Memorial Library of North Andover and resides in the Houghton Library vault at Harvard. A quotation from Bradstreet can be found on a plaque at the Bradstreet Gate in Harvard Yard: \\"I came into this Country, where I found a new World and new manners at which my heart rose.\\" Unfortunately the plaque seems to be based on a misinterpretation; the following sentence is \\"But after I was convinced it was the way of God, I submitted to it and joined to the church at Boston.\\" This suggests her heart rose up in protest rather than in joy. =Role of women= Marriage played a large role in the lives of Puritan women. In Bradstreet's poem, \\"To My Dear And Loving Husband,\\" she reveals that she is one with her husband. \\"If ever two were one, then surely we.\\" The Puritans believed marriage to be a gift from God. In another of Bradstreet's works, \\"Before the Birth of One of Her Children\\", Bradstreet acknowledges God's gift of marriage. In the lines, \\"And if I see not half my days that's due, what nature would, God grant to yours, and you;\\" Bradstreet is saying that if she was to die soon, what would God give her husband. She could be referring to him possibly remarrying after she dies. Another line shows that she believes that it is possible for her husband to remarry. By using the lines, \\"These O protect from stepdame's injury\\", Bradstreet is calling for her children to be protected from the abuse of a future step mother. The fact that Bradstreet believes that God will grant her husband a new wife if she dies shows how much Puritan women believed in marriage. Throughout \\"Letter to Her Husband, Absent upon Public Employment,\\" Bradstreet states how she feels lost when her husband is not around and that life is always better when he is around. In Bradstreet's poems, it can be assumed she truly loved her husband and missed him when he was away from her and the family. Bradstreet does not resent her husband for leaving her with the family and with all of the household needs; she just misses him and wants him back with her. The primary roles of women in a Puritan society were to be wives and mothers, and provide the family with their everyday needs. Women were expected to make the clothing for the family, cook the meals, keep the household clean, and teach the children how to live a Puritan lifestyle. Various works of Bradstreet are dedicated to her children. In works such as \\"Before the Birth of One of Her Children\\" and \\"In Reference to Her Children\\", Bradstreet shows the love that she has for her children, both unborn and born. In Puritan society, children were also gifts from God, and she loved and cared for all of her children just as she loved and cared for her husband. She always believes they too are bound with her to make \\"one.\\" =Reception= Because writing was not considered to be an acceptable role for women at the time, Bradstreet was met with criticism. One of the most prominent figures of her time, John Winthrop, criticized Ann Hopkins, wife of prominent Connecticut colony governor Edward Hopkins. He mentioned in his journal that Hopkins should have kept to being a housewife and left writing and reading for men, \\"whose minds are stronger.\\" Despite heavy criticism of women during her time, Bradstreet continued to write which led to the belief that she was interested in rebelling against societal norms of the time. A prominent minister of the time, Thomas Parker, was also against the idea of women writing and sent a letter to his own sister saying that publishing a book was outside of the realm of what women were supposed to do. No doubt he was opposed to the writing of Bradstreet as well. These negative views were likely augmented by the fact that Puritan ideologies stated that women were vastly inferior to men. Literary style and themes =Background= Bradstreet let her homesick imagination marshall her store of learning, for the glory of God and for the expression of an inquiring mind and sensitive, philosophical spirit.White, Elixabth Wade 'The Tenth Muse:An Appraisal of Anne Bradstreet' William & Mary Quarterly Review V111 July 1951 We see examples of this homesick imagination in her poem \\"Dialogue Between Old England and New\\" which emphasizes the relationship between the motherland and the colonies as parental; and gives assurance that the bond between the two countries will continue. It also implies that whatever happens to England will also affect America. The poem often refers to England as \\"mother\\" and America as \\"Daughter\\", which emphasizes the bond Bradstreet feels herself to her home country. =Intended audience= Anne Bradstreet's works tend to be directed to members of her family and are generally intimate. For instance, in Bradstreet's \\"To My Dear and Loving Husband\\", the poem's intended audience is her husband, Simon Bradstreet. The focal point of this poem is the love that she has for her husband. \\"I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold\\". To Bradstreet, her husband's love is worth more than some of the best treasures that this earth has to offer. She also makes it a point to show to her husband that nothing can fill the love that she has for her husband. The lines, \\"My love is such that rivers cannot quench,\\" the rivers represent death, which she says the fire of her love is invulnerable to. The last line of the poem sums this up with the words, \\"Then when we live no more, we may live ever.\\"\\"Quotes from annebradstreet.com\\" In \\"A Letter to Her Husband Absent upon Public Employment\\" Bradstreet writes a letter to her husband who is away from her working at his job. Bradstreet uses various metaphors to describe her husband. The most visible use of metaphor that Bradstreet uses is comparing her husband to the seasons. When summer is gone, winter soon arrives. Summer can be seen as a time of happiness and warmth. Winter on the other hand can be seen as being gloomy and cold. Bradstreet's husband is her Sun and when he is with her it is always summer. She is happy and warm from the love that her husband brings when he is around. When her husband leaves home for work, everything then becomes winter. It is a sad, cold time for Bradstreet and she wishes for her husband to soon return. \\"Return, return, sweet Sol, from Capricorn.\\" She wants her husband to know that she needs him and without him everything feels gloomy. She is not concerned with what others think. It is not intended for anyone else except her husband. Bradstreet knows that the situation is inevitable, summer can't be around always and soon winter will follow. Her husband's job is important. He can't be there always and he must go away at times. \\"Till nature's sad decree shall call thee hence.\\" One thing that keeps her going is that even though they are far away from each other, they are one with each other. By reading Bradstreet's works and recognizing her intended audience, one can get an idea of how life was for Puritan women. According to U.S. History.org Puritan women were required to attend worship services, yet they could not to speak or offer prayer. Women were also not allowed to attend town meetings or be involved in the decisions that were discussed. If Puritan women were to be seen and not heard in public, then one can say that most of their works are not meant for public consumption. Bradstreet was not responsible for her writing becoming public. Bradstreet's brother-in-law, John Woodbridge, sent her work off to be published. Bradstreet was a righteous woman and her poetry was not meant to bring attention to herself. Though Bradstreet's works are renowned in today's world, it still was a great risk to have had her work published during the time in which she lived. Her being a published author would have not been considered as a typical role of the Puritan woman. =Themes= The role of women is a common subject found in Bradstreet's poems. Living in a Puritan society, Bradstreet did not approve of the stereotypical idea that women were inferior to men during the 1600s. Women were expected to spend all their time cooking, cleaning, taking care of their children, and attending to their husband's every need. In her poem \\"In Honour of that High and Mighty Princess Queen Elizabeth of Happy Memory,\\" Bradstreet questions this belief. \\"Now say, have women worth? or have they none? Or had they some, but with our queen is't gone? Nay Masculines, you have thus taxt us long, But she, though dead, will vindicate our wrong, Let such as say our Sex is void of Reason, Know tis a Slander now, but once was Treason.\\" Another recurring subject in Bradstreet's work is mortality. In many of her works, she writes about her death and how it will affect her children and others in her life. The recurrence of this mortality theme can be viewed as autobiographical. Because her work was not intended for the public, she was referring to her own medical problems and her belief that she would die. In addition to her medical history (smallpox and partial paralysis), Bradstreet and her family dealt with a major house fire that left them homeless and devoid of all personal belongings. She hoped her children would think of her fondly and honor her memory in her poem, \\"Before the Birth of One of Her Children.\\" \\"If any worth or virtue were in me, Let that live freshly in thy memory.\\" Bradstreet is also known for using her poetry as a means to question her own Puritan beliefs; her doubt concerning God's mercy and her struggles to continue to place her faith in him are exemplified in such poems as \\"Verses upon the Burning of our House\\" and \\"In Memory of My Dear Grandchild\\". Her works demonstrate a conflict that many Puritans would not have felt comfortable discussing, let alone writing. In \\"The Prologue,\\" Bradstreet demonstrates how society trivialized the accomplishments of women. The popular belief that women should be doing other things like sewing, rather than writing poetry. \\"I am obnoxious to each carping tongue Who says my hand a needle better fits, A poet's pen all scorn I should thus wrong. For such despite they cast on female wits: If what I do prove well, it won't advance, They'll say it's stol'n, or else it was by chance.\\" In \\"To My Dear and Loving Husband,\\" Bradstreet confesses her undying love for Simon saying \\"Thy love is such I can no way repay, The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.\\" Her deep passions can be found again in \\"A Letter to Her Husband, Absent upon Public Employment.\\" Her overt affections for her husband help readers to understand Bradstreet's temerity. Anne Bradstreet wrote in a different format than other writers of her time. This mainly is due to the fact that she wrote her feelings in a book not knowing someone would read them. In her poem \\"A letter to my Husband\\" she speaks about the loss of her husband when he is gone. \\"I like the earth this season morn in black, my sun is gone.\\" Here Anne is expressing her feelings of missing her husband when he is away. \\"To my faults that well you know I have let be interred in my oblivious grave; if any worth of virtue were in me, let that live freshly in they memory\\". Anne expresses the feeling she has of wanting her children to remember her in a good light not in a bad light. =Tone= Bradstreet often used a sarcastic tone in her poetry. In the first stanza of \\"The Prologue\\" she claims \\"for my mean pen are too superior things\\" referring to society's belief that she is unfit to write about wars and the founding of cities because she is a woman. In stanza five Bradstreet continues to display irony by stating \\"who says my hand a needle better fits\\". This is another example of her sarcastic voice because society during this time expected women to perform household chores rather than write poetry. Although Anne Bradstreet endured many hardships in her life, her poems are usually written in a hopeful and positive tone. Throughout her poem In \\"Memory of My Dear Grandchild Simon Bradstreet,\\" she mentions that even though she has lost her grandson in this world, she will one day be reunited with him in Heaven. In \\"Upon the Burning of Our House,\\" Bradstreet describes her house in flames but selflessly declares \\"there's wealth enough, I need no more.\\" Although Bradstreet lost many of her material items she kept a positive attitude and remained strong through God. =Quaternions= Bradstreet wrote four quaternions, \\"Seasons,\\" \\"Elements,\\" \\"Humours,\\" and \\"Ages,\\" which made possible her \\"development as a poet in terms of technical craftsmanship as she learned to fashion the form artistically.\\" Bradstreet's first two quaternions were her most successful.Eberwein, Jane Donahue 'Early American Literature' vol 9 no 1 University of North Carolina Press Spring 1974 The central tension in her work is that between delight in the world and belief of its vanity.

In 1910, it was made part of the larger French Equatorial Africa. Modern Republic of Congo is considered French Congo's successor state, having virtually identical borders, and having inherited rights to sovereignty and independence from France through the dissolution of French Equatorial Africa in the late 1950s. History The French Congo began at Brazzaville on 10 September 1880 as a protectorate over the Bateke people along the north bank of the Congo River, was formally established as the French Congo on 30 November 1882, and was confirmed at the Berlin Conference of 1884‚Äì85. Its borders with Cabinda, Cameroons, and the Congo Free State were established by treaties over the next decade. The plan to develop the colony was to grant massive concessions to some thirty French companies. These were granted huge swaths of land on the promise they would be developed. This development was limited and amounted mostly to the extraction of ivory, rubber, and timber. These operations often involved great brutality and the near enslavement of the locals. Even with these measures most of the companies lost money. Only about ten earned profits. Many of the companies' vast holdings existed only on paper with virtually no presence on the ground in Africa. The French Congo was sometimes known as Gabon-Congo.Payeur-Didelot: \\"Gabon ‚Äì Colonie fran√ßaise du Gabon-Congo, 1/3,700,000\\", 1894. It formally added Gabon on in 1891, was officially renamed Middle Congo () in 1903, was temporarily divorced from Gabon in 1906, and was then reunited as French Equatorial Africa in 1910 in an attempt to emulate the relative success of French West Africa. A 1906 study , was published in conjunction with the French Colonial Exposition in Marseille. In 1925 African-American historian, sociologist, and Pan-Africanist W. E. B. Du Bois wrote \\"'Batouala' voices it.

It is both a commemoration of the Library of Alexandria that was lost in antiquity, and an attempt to rekindle something of the brilliance that this earlier center of study and erudition represented. The idea of reviving the old library dates back to 1974, when a committee set up by Alexandria University selected a plot of land for its new library. Construction work began in 1995 and, after some US$220 million had been spent, the complex was officially inaugurated on 16 October 2002. In 2010, the library received a donation of 500,000 books from the Biblioth√®que nationale de France (BnF). The gift makes the Bibliotheca Alexandrina the sixth-largest Francophone library in the world. The library has shelf space for eight million books, with the main reading room covering 20,000 square metres (220,000 sq ft). The complex also houses a conference center; specialized libraries for maps, multimedia, the blind and visually impaired, young people, and for children; four museums; four art galleries for temporary exhibitions; 15 permanent exhibitions; a planetarium; and a manuscript restoration laboratory. History Mediterranean side of library Inside Bibliotheca Alexandrina The idea of reviving the old library dates back to 1974, when a committee set up by Alexandria University selected a plot of land for its new library, between the campus and the seafront, close to where the ancient library once stood. The recreation of the ancient library was not only adopted by other individuals and agencies, it garnered support from Egyptian politicians. One leading supporter of the project was former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak; UNESCO was also quick to embrace the concept of endowing the Mediterranean region with a center of cultural and scientific excellence. This initiative by the Egyptian government, UNESCO, and Alexandria University was undertaken \\"with the aim of re-establishing Alexandria as one of the great intellectual and cultural centres of the twenty-first century\\". UNESCO's involvement beginning in 1986 created a great opportunity for the project to truly be international in focus. An architectural design competition was organized by UNESCO in 1988 to choose a design worthy of the site and its heritage. The competition was won by Sn√∏hetta, a Norwegian architectural office, associated with Austrian architect Christoph Kapeller and Egyptian architect Ihab El Habbak, from among more than 1,400 entries. This architectural team consisted of ten members representing six countries. In addition, Unesco created an International Commission for the Bibliotheca Alexandrina which consisted of high-level representatives from 18 diverse countries and organizations. Given Unesco‚Äôs involvement and the investment by the international community, this project achieved its mission to ‚Äúplay an educational, cultural, and scientific role throughout the region‚Äù. The first pledges were made for funding the project at a conference held in 1990 in Aswan: USD $65 million, mostly from the MENA states. Construction work began in 1995 and, after some US$220 million had been spent, the complex was officially inaugurated on 16 October 2002.Alexandrina The Bibliotheca Alexandrina is trilingual, containing books in Classical Arabic, English, and French. In 2010, the library received a donation of 500,000 books from the National Library of France, Biblioth√®que nationale de France (BnF). The gift makes the Bibliotheca Alexandrina the sixth-largest Francophone library in the world. The BA also is now the largest depository of French books in the Middle East and North Africa, surpassing those of Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco, in addition to being the main French library in Africa.A Donation of Half Million Books from France to the BA, 1 December 2009, Bibliotheca Alexandrina Building and library features The dimensions of the project are vast: the library has shelf space for eight million books, with the main reading room covering on eleven cascading levels. The complex also houses a conference center; specialized libraries for maps, multimedia, the blind and visually impaired, young people, and for children; four museums; four art galleries for temporary exhibitions; 15 permanent exhibitions; a planetarium; and a manuscript restoration laboratory. The library's architecture is equally striking. The main reading room stands beneath a 32-meter-high glass-panelled roof, tilted out toward the sea like a sundial, and measuring some 160 m in diameter. The walls are of gray Aswan granite, carved with characters from 120 human scripts. The collections at the Bibliotheca Alexandrina were donated from all over the world. The Spanish donated documents that detailed their period of Moorish rule. The French also donated, giving the library documents dealing with the building of the Suez Canal.  Internet Archive partnership  The BA/IA partnership is built with the aims to preserve heritage for future generations and to provide universal access to human knowledge. The BA was the site of the first mirror and external backup of the Internet Archive. The Internet Archive donated five million USD to the BA, including: * 10 billion web pages spanning the years 1996‚Äì2001 from over 16 million sites * 2000 hours of Egyptian and U.S. television broadcasts * 1000 archival films * 100 terabytes of data stored on 200 computers * A books-scanning facility for local books Library services The BA's mission is to be a center of excellence in the production and dissemination of knowledge and to be a place of dialogue, learning and understanding between cultures and peoples. The new Bibliotheca Alexandrina is more than a library. BA hosts book fairs, book launches, ceremonies, cinema, competitions, concerts, conferences, educational courses, exhibitions, festivals, forums, lectures, meetings, performances, presentations, reading activities, round table discussions, seminars, shows, theater, training courses, video-conferences and workshops for adults, children, young people and the academic community. Here are some of the areas and exhibits that it comprises: =The main library= Can hold up to millions of books. =Six specialized libraries= * The Arts and Multimedia Library * The Taha Hussein Library for the visually impaired * The Children's Library * The Young People's Library * The Microforms Library * The Rare Books and Special Collections Library =A copy of the Internet Archive= The library provides access to print on demand books via the Espresso Book Machine. Taha Hussein Library for the Blind and Visually Impaired The Taha Hussein Library contains materials for the blind and visually impaired using special software that makes it possible for readers to read books and journals. It is named after Taha Hussein, the Egyptian professor of Arabic and literary critic and one of the leading figures of the Arab Renaissance (Nahda) in literature, who was himself blinded at the age of three. Nobel Section Contains book collections of Nobel Prize Laureates in Literature from 1901 to present. The Nobel Section was inaugurated by Queen Silvia of Sweden and Queen Sonja of Norway on 24 April 2002. = Four museums= Antiquities Museum Established in 2001, the BA Antiquities Museum is the first archeological museum to be situated within a library. The primary aims of the museum are to promote research, creativity, and cultural awareness. Holding approximately 1,316 artifacts, the Antiquities Museum collection provides a glimpse into Egyptian history from the Pharaonic era to the conquest of Alexander the Great to the Roman civilizations before the advent of Islam across Egypt. The collection includes underwater antiquities from the Mediterranean seabed near the Eastern Harbour and the Bay of Abukir. The museum provides descriptions of artifacts in three languages: English, Arabic, and French. Manuscript Museum The Manuscript Museum provides visitors and researchers with rare manuscripts and books. Established in 2001, the Manuscript Museum contains the world's largest collection of digital manuscripts. It is an academic institution that is affiliated to the Library of Alexandria. The stated aims of the museum are to preserve heritage, foster human cadres in the conservation and restoration of manuscripts, and create a generation of new restorers. The Manuscript Museum operates alongside the Manuscript Center, which provides digital access to more than 6,000 rare books, maps, and documents within the museum's collection. There are three sections housed within the museum: * Rare Collections: This section includes the BA's unique items, such as original manuscripts, early printed books, maps, and antique coins. * Microfilm: This section includes microfilms of around 30,000 rare manuscripts and 50,000 documents, as well as a collection from The British Library of around 14,000 Arabic, Persian, and Turkish manuscripts, which is considered the largest collection in Europe. Additionally, visitors can find a vast archive of national and Arabic newspapers. * Museographic Display: This section is divided into the Exhibition Gallery group and the Traveling Exhibition group. The Exhibition Gallery displays the Manuscript Center's electronic publications and selected digital manuscripts. Sadat Museum This museum contains many personal belongings of the Egyptian president Anwar Al Sadat. The collections include some of his military robes, his Nobel Prize medal, his copy of the Qur'an, a few of his handwritten letters, pictures of him and his family, and the blood stained military robe he wore the day of his assassination. The museum also contains a recording in his voice of part of the Qur'an and assorted newspaper articles written about him. History of Science =Permanent exhibitions=  Digital collections  * Our Digital World: The \\"Our Digital World\\" exhibition displays some of the library's digital projects, including digital archives of former presidents, the Science Supercourse, and the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL). Additionally, digital versions of valuable books, such as Description de l'Egypte and L'Art Arabe are available.  Personal collections  * The World of Shadi Abdel Salam: \\"The World of Shadi Abdel Salam\\" exhibition contains many of the works and effects of the Egyptian film director, screenwriter, and costume designer Shadi Abdel Salam, donated by his family to the Library to put on permanent display. This includes his personal library, some of his furniture, several awards, and many storyboard paintings and costumes from several of his films. * Impressions of Alexandria: The \\"Impressions of Alexandria\\" exhibition is divided into two sections: Alexandria as seen by Artists and Travelers, and Cosmopolitan Alexandria: a Photographic Memory. The former section features travelers' and artists' original lithographs, maps, and engravings about Alexandria for the time period of the 15th century to the 19th century. The latter section features photographs from the 19th century to the mid-20th century, drawing attention to cultural works from writers and artists of the time. =CULTURAMA= The culturama hall consists of a huge 180-degree panoramic interactive computer screen with a diameter of 10 meters that is made up of nine separate flat screens arranged in a semicircle and nine video projectors controlled by a single computer. Culturama has enabled the display of information that could never have been displayed clearly using a regular computer display system.CULTNAT Celebrated CULTURAMA Patent in the Smart Village United Nations. 11 July 2008. Retrieved 5 October 2014. It was developed by the Egyptian Center for Documentation of Cultural and Natural Heritage (CULTNAT) and holds its patent in 2007. It displayed 3 periods from the history of Egypt: * Ancient Egyptian Period * Highlights of Islamic Civilization * Modern Egypt =VISTA= Virtual Immersive Science and Technology Applications. It uses CAVE Technology. VISTA features several projects including * BA Model: A complete virtual recreation of the BA including the Library's main building, planetarium, study rooms, and even the Library's furniture will be seen clearly and accurately in this demo. * Sphinx * Socio-Economic Data Visualization: A new visualization technique for multi- dimensional numerical data. The case study uses data provided by the UN, including health care, life duration expectancy and literacy rate over a 25-year period in some countries. Panoramic photo for planetarium = Digital Assets Repository = The Digital Assets Repository (DAR) is a system developed at the Bibliotheca Alexandrina (BA) by the International School of Information Science (ISIS) to create and maintain digital library collections and preserve them to future generations, as well as providing free public access to the library's digitized collections through a web-based search and browsing facilities via DAR's website. Management The founding director was Ismail Serageldin, who served until May 2017. He also was chair of the Board of Directors for each of the BA's affiliated research institutes and museums. He was succeeded by current manager Dr. Moustafa El Feqy. Post- revolutionary involvement The Bibliotheca Alexandrina held a variety of symposiums in 2011 in support of the Egyptian community and emphasizing the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, the Egyptian Constitution and Democratic Government in Arab nations. The library also displays a photo gallery of the January 25, 2011 revolution and is working to document it in a wide variety of formats. Criticism Criticism of the library comes chiefly from two angles. Many allege that the library is a white elephant impossible for modern Egypt to sustain, and serves as little more than a vanity project for the Egyptian government. Furthermore, there are fears that censorship, long the bane of Egyptian academia, would affect the library's collection. In addition, the building's elaborate architecture (which imitates a rising Sun) upset some who believed too much money was being spent on construction rather than the library's actual collection. Due to the lack of available funds, the library had only 500,000 books in 2002, low compared to other national libraries. (However, in 2010 the library received an additional 500,000 books from the Biblioth√®que nationale de France.) It has been estimated that it will take 80 years to fill the library to capacity at the current level of funding. The library relies heavily on donations to buy books for its collections.

It is the newest national park of New Zealand and opened in 2002. The protected area covers about 85% of the island. History Rakiura National Park is the 14th of New Zealand's national parks and was officially opened on 9 March 2002 by the Prime Minister, Helen Clark, the Minister of Conservation, Sandra Lee, and the mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary. It is New Zealand's newest national park. It covers close to , which is about 85% of Stewart Island, New Zealand's third-largest island. The park area excludes the township area around Halfmoon Bay (Oban) and some roads as well as private or Maori-owned land further inland. It is made up of a network of former nature reserves, scenic reserves, and State Forest areas. A chain sculpture at the entrance to Rakiura National Park symbolises the Maori view that Stewart Island is anchored to South Island; the sculpture was unveiled as part of the opening of the national park. In 2008, a similar sculpture was erected in Bluff, and it represents the other end of the chain. =Natural history= Near Port William Hut, North Coast The popular Rakiura Track is within the national park. Many native birds can be found within the park, and Rakiura offers perhaps the best opportunity anywhere in New Zealand for viewing kiwi in the wild. This is in part due to the absence of stoats and ferrets. Certain coastal areas of this park are breeding areas for the endangered yellow-eyed penguin. Weka, a flightless and curious bird species, can only be found on offshore islands. In the 1970s, kakapo were found in the Tin Range at a time when it was thought that the species was nearly extinct. The kakapo have been transferred to nearby Codfish Island, which is not part of the national park.

Yanni continues to use the musical shorthand that he developed as a child, blending jazz, classical, soft rock, and world music to create predominantly instrumental works. Although this genre of music was not well suited for commercial pop radio and music television, Yanni received international recognition by producing concerts at historic monuments and by producing videos that were broadcast on public television. His breakthrough concert, Live at the Acropolis, yielded the second best-selling music concert video of all time. Additional historic sites for Yanni's concerts have included India's Taj Mahal, China's Forbidden City, the United Arab Emirates' Burj Khalifa, Russia's Kremlin, Puerto Rico's El Morro castle, Lebanon's ancient city of Byblos, Tunisia's Roman Theatre of Carthage, India's Laxmi Vilas Palace, the Egyptian pyramids and Great Sphinx of Giza, and the Amman Citadel. At least sixteen of Yanni's albums have peaked at No. 1 in Billboard's \\"Top New Age Album\\" category, and two albums (Dare to Dream and In My Time) received Grammy Award nominations. Yanni has performed in more than 30 countries on five continents, and through late 2015 had performed live in concert before more than 5 million people and had accumulated more than 40 platinum and gold albums globally, with sales totaling over 25 million copies. A longtime fundraiser for public television, Yanni's compositions have been used on commercial television programs, especially for sporting events. He has written film scores and the music for an award-winning British Airways television commercial. Yanni popularized the combination of electronic music synthesizers with a full symphony orchestra. He has employed musicians of various nationalities and has incorporated a variety of exotic instruments to create music that has been called an eclectic fusion of ethnic sounds. Influenced by his encounters with cultures around the world, Yanni has been called a \\"true global artist\\" and his music is said to reflect his \\"one world, one people\\" philosophy. Early life Yanni was born November 14, 1954, in Kalamata, Greece, the son of a banker, Sotiri Chryssomallis, and a homemaker, Felitsa (short for Triandafelitsa, which means \\"rose\\"). He displayed musical talent at a young age, playing the piano at the age of 6. His parents encouraged him to learn at his own pace and in his own way, without formal music training. The self-taught musician continues to use the \\"musical shorthand\\" that he developed as a child, rather than employ traditional musical notation. Yanni set a Greek national record in the 50-meter freestyle swimming competition at age 14. In November 1972, Yanni moved from Greece to the United States to attend the University of Minnesota beginning in January 1973, majoring in psychology. For a time he earned money by washing dishes at the student union. Yanni later explained that learning English forced him to read each paragraph several times in what he called a slow and frustrating process, but which helped him memorize the material and do well on tests. He received a B.A. degree in psychology in 1976. During his time as a student, Yanni played in a local rock band and continued to study piano and other keyboard instruments. Upon graduating, when he dedicated himself exclusively to music for one full year and found he was the happiest he had ever been, he said he decided music would be his life's work. Music career In 1977, Yanni joined the Minneapolis-based rock group Chameleon, performing with its founder, drummer Charlie Adams, with whom he would work into the 2010s. While in Minneapolis, Yanni also worked with choreographer Loyce Houlton to provide music for dance works produced by the Minnesota Dance Theatre. After touring with Chameleon from 1980 to 1984, Yanni moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of movie soundtrack work. =1980s to early 1990s: Emergence and recognition= In 1980, Yanni recorded his first album Optimystique, which Atlantic Records re-released in 1984 and Private Music re- released in 1989. Yanni formed a band in 1987 and began to tour in 1988 with an ensemble including pianist/singer John Tesh and drummer Charlie Adams, promoting his early albums Keys to Imagination, Out of Silence, and Chameleon Days. A highlight of the tour was a performance with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra that elicited a positive review, considered seminal to Yanni's public recognition, from a Dallas Times Herald critic. Yanni's emergence was said to be \\"timed perfectly\\" with the growing popularity of contemporary instrumental music. In this time frame, Yanni wrote motion picture soundtracks for Steal the Sky (1988), Heart of Midnight (1988), I Love You Perfect (1989), She'll Take Romance (1990), When You Remember Me (1990), Children of the Bride (1990), and Hua qi Shao Lin (1994). The Odeon of Herodes Atticus at the Acropolis of Athens, site of Yanni's September 1993 breakthrough concert Yanni Live at the Acropolis, performed in his native country Greece. Yanni gained visibility as the result of his November 1990 appearances in People magazine and on The Oprah Winfrey Show with actress Linda Evans, with whom he had been in a relationship since 1989. However, high-visibility appearances on public television, best-selling records and videos, and overflow concerts earned him recognition beyond his relationship with Evans. Dare to Dream, released in 1992, was Yanni's first Grammy-nominated album. It included \\"Aria,\\" a song based on L√©o Delibes' The Flower Duet (Lakm√©, 1883) and popularized by an award-winning British Airways commercial. A second Grammy-nominated album, In My Time, followed in 1993. =1990s: Acropolis, world concerts, exhaustion and renewal= Yanni's breakthrough concert, Live at the Acropolis, was filmed in September 1993 at the 2,000-year-old Herodes Atticus Theater at the Acropolis of Athens, an album, VHS and Laserdisc being released in 1994. Acropolis was Yanni's first live album, and used his core band with a full sixty piece orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra which was arranged and conducted by Iranian-American musician Shahrdad Rohani. Without financial backing, Yanni risked $2 million of his personal fortune in the Acropolis production in a strategy to boost his artistic profile and open new markets for his music. The resulting video was broadcast on PBS and became one of its most popular programs ever, seen in 65 countries by half a billion people. It became the second best-selling music concert video of all time (after Michael Jackson's Thriller), selling more than 7 million copies worldwide. In March 1997, Yanni became one of the few Western artists permitted to perform and record at the Taj Mahal in India. Yanni followed in May 1997 with performances at the Forbidden City in Beijing, China, becoming the first Western artist in modern times permitted to perform at the historic site. Live broadcasts of the two concerts were seen by 100 million television viewers throughout the world. The two events formed the live album and video, Tribute, released in November 1997. After negotiating the demands of gaining permission to perform at the Taj Mahal and Forbidden City in 1997, breaking up with Linda Evans in early 1998, and completing a long world tour later in 1998, Yanni halted his music career. Yanni later related that he had become depressed, and returned to Greece to live with his parents for three months before traveling the world. He didn't do an interview for two years, later explaining, \\"I traveled. I wanted to see other people's ideas of life, get out of the American dream.\\" =2000s to 2010: After a hiatus, new perspectives= In 2000, after the two- year hiatus, Yanni released If I Could Tell You, his first studio album in seven years. The album sold 55,000 copies in its first week and landed at No. 20 on the Billboard charts, his highest debut to date. Yanni described the album as more of an even-tempered \\"listening\\" album, less dramatic than the live concert albums Live at the Acropolis or Tribute. He explained that he himself created all the album's sounds, including apparent vocalizations, through the manipulation of sound in his studio. The music in Yanni's 2003 album Ethnicity represented many of the world's cultures, Yanni saying it uses ethnicity to reflect the color and beauty of a multicultural society. The album was released near the publication date of Yanni's autobiography, Yanni in Words. On October 23, 2003, Yanni performed a keyboard instrumental version of The Star-Spangled Banner before Game 5 of the 2003 World Series. For the first time in his career, Yanni brought vocalists to the forefront in the Ric Wake collaboration Yanni Voices, the artist's first studio album in six years. PBS broadcast video of a November 2008 Voices Acapulco concert weeks before the album's March 24, 2009 release by Walt Disney Records' Disney Pearl Imprint, the album release preceding a tour produced by Pearl's Buena Vista Concerts division. The album Mexicanisimo, released in November of Mexico's bicentennial year 2010, was a tribute to that country through Yanni's collaborative interpretation of its folk music. It involved collaboration with singer-songwriter Pepe Aguilar and singer-actress Lucero. =2010s: New sound designs, and a return to world tours= Yanni onstage with his orchestra and vocalists. While performing, Yanni divides his time among two decks of electronic keyboards and an acoustic piano, and conducts his orchestra. The Truth of Touch album was released in February 2011, Yanni's first studio album of new material since Ethnicity eight years earlier. Truth of Touch's varied content reflected contemporary instrumental, electronic, and cinematic influences, and crossed over into popular, new age, and world music. Though Yanni said that Truth of Touch was started by experimenting with new sound designs, Allmusic's James Christopher Monger said that the album shows Yanni returning to his instrumental roots, and should appeal to fans of his music from the mid-1990s. Three of fifteen tracks on the predominantly instrumental album included vocals from respective Yanni Voices vocalists. In April 2012, Yanni released the Live at El Morro, Puerto Rico live album CD and DVD which were recorded and filmed at two outdoor concerts on December 16 and 17, 2011 on the grounds of the Castillo (Fort) San Felipe del Morro (\\"El Morro\\"), a UNESCO World Heritage Site in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The recorded concerts were broadcast on PBS beginning in March 2012, the production constituting Yanni's tenth collaboration with that organization. Yanni performed again in China in the February 9, 2013, CCTV Spring Festival Gala (annual audience 700 million) with Chinese zither artist Chang Jing in what was the first year that CCTV had invited foreign artists to perform. For the performance, Yanni released a single \\"East Meets West\\" which was a mashup of his several famous songs (Santorini, North Shore of Matsushima) together with a solo part performed on Chinese zither. Yanni's 2010s tours included new vocalists, distinct from the 2008‚Äì2009 Yanni Voices vocalists, though the setlists remained predominantly instrumental. In March 2014, Yanni released his seventeenth studio album, Inspirato, a collaboration with operatic tenor Pl√°cido Domingo and producer Ric Wake that, like Yanni Voices five years earlier, highlighted vocal performances. In Inspirato, distinguished operatic vocalists performed remakes of songs that Yanni had previously released over his career, the songs' titles and lyrics being predominantly in the Italian language. In March 2015, Yanni released the title soundtrack for a Chinese documentary movie Hexi Corridor. On October 30 and 31, 2015, Yanni performed two concerts on the grounds of the Egyptian pyramids and Great Sphinx of Giza, his first performance in Egypt. The concerts included fireworks and a video broadcast from International Space Station commander Scott Kelly, and were recorded in 4K HD for subsequent broadcast on PBS. To convey an image of stable security after the Egyptian Crisis (2011‚Äì14), an Egyptian security force of 3,000 people secured the concert area. In December 2015, Yanni produced a song, \\"Seven Billion Dreams,\\" for a NASA video that marked the 15th anniversary of the International Space Station. In January 2016, Yanni released his eighteenth studio album, Sensuous Chill, which, being built around synthesizers, programmed rhythms and electronic sounds, was said to \\"come full circle\\" to his early-1980s albums. Yanni's single, \\"When Dreams Come True\\", called a \\"minimal piano-led\\" piece, was composed incrementally throughout a 60-date North American tour as a series of improvisations performed during successive shows. Its first complete live performance was in February 2019 at the Winter at Tantora Festival in Al-\`Ula, Saudi Arabia, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Yanni's August 2019 single honoring his daughter Krystal√°n is called \\"Ladyhawk\\", alluding to how she watches over him like a guardian angel. In November 2019, Yanni released single \\"Blue\\", taking inspiration from the ocean. In August 2020, Yanni released a studio album 'In His Purest Form', containing solo piano performances of his previously released songs. This is his first piano solo album since 'In My Time' in 1993. In the 2010s, Yanni's international tours included performances in over thirty countries on five continents, including (alphabetically) Argentina, Armenia, Bahrain, Belarus, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Egypt, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Mexico, Oman, Panama, Poland, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States (including Puerto Rico), and Uzbekistan. Influences, music and concerts =Musical Influences= From childhood, Yanni accepted a wide variety of musical styles, listening to radio stations from Northern Africa, Arab countries, and Europe. He observed that \\"there were no rock stations or classical stations‚Äîeach station would just play everything.\\" Yanni's music is said to reflect his encounters with cultures around the world and embody his philosophy of \\"one world, one people.\\" In this vein, Booth Newspapers' Jeffrey Kaczmarczyk perceived the eclectic inspirations of Yanni's music to be an element of his success: Yanni's \\"Middle Eastern and Oriental scales and mixed meters sound just exotic enough to entice his middle-of-the-road fans, but not so authentic as to mystify folks who grew up with a backbeat, so you can't lose it,\\" adding that certain songs \\"leave you with a sense that you've just heard a bit of a steel drum or a Greek bouzouki or a Japanese koto or possibly all three.\\" Yanni's musical influences include music from Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East, as well as classical, rock and roll, and electronic music. Yanni explained that the 1970s, with its new technology and electronic instruments, were particularly influential at that stage in his career, and that even recently his Truth of Touch album (2011) was started by experimenting with new sound designs. Having been exposed to classical music very early in life‚Äîlistening to Bach at age 8‚Äîhe counts several classical pianists and composers among his influences, citing Beethoven as a favorite and Chopin as \\"No. 2 favorite.\\" Yanni mentioned being influenced not only by classical composers like Mozart and Bach, but also rock and roll bands such as Led Zeppelin, the People!, and Black Sabbath. Yanni explained that \\"the most influence I've ever had from music was doing (soundtracks for) movies... mostly instrumental music,\\" mentioning his love for the work of Jerry Goldsmith and John Williams. The Augusta Chronicle's Kelly Jasper noted that most of Yanni's music is instrumental, indicating that Yanni surmised that the lack of lyrics is what allowed his music to become popular internationally. Yanni went on to say, \\"There are no lyrics in my music for the most part, so the whole message is transmitted through the rhythm, melody, and sounds, and I think that has to do with crossing all the borders and being able to go to different countries.\\" \\"It is very difficult, if not impossible, to lie with instrumental music because it deals in emotions only.\\" He has also said that words operate in a different area of the brain, and lyrics \\"tend to put a song into a box.\\" However, Yanni performed with four vocalists in the forefront in Yanni Voices (2008‚Äì2009), and performed with vocalists on tours and in the Live at El Morro, Puerto Rico concerts (December 2011) and CD/DVD (2012). In late 2011 Yanni remarked that he tends to prefer instrumental music \\"because it's more open, but the human voice too can be the most expressive instrument known to man. There is power to it.\\" Referring to his creative experiences on the 2009 Voices project, Yanni explained that \\"while most of the music I write is instrumental, I love to use the human voice as another instrument.\\" =Music genres distinguished from the \\"new age\\" spiritual movement= While Yanni has said that new age is \\"a spiritual definition more than a musical definition,\\" his music is said to be \\"adopted by\\" the New Age movement as it gained mainstream momentum. His music is also called contemporary instrumental and has been described as \\"an instrumental blend of fusion-jazz, world music, classical, and soft rock.\\" However, at least as early as 1988, Yanni was said to shun labels such as \\"Greek\\" and \\"new age,\\" emphasizing that \\"when someone says new age music, I think of something that you put on in the background while you're vacuuming the house. I don't want to relax the audience; I want to engage them in the music, get them interested.\\" Distinguishing his work from what others have called ambient mood music, Yanni pointed out in 1994: \\"New age implies a more subdued, more relaxed music than what I do. My music can be very rhythmic, very energetic, even very ethnic.\\" In 2012, Yanni remarked that he has never liked putting art into categories or assigning labels, adding that he always composed music \\"to honestly reflect the lessons learned and the experiences I have shared throughout my life.\\" For example, Yanni's university study of psychology influenced his music: \\"When I create music, it is a reflection of my soul, my experiences in life and my relationships with other people and cultures. Psychology, and understanding who we are as people in this world, is present in almost every creative thought I have.\\" =Unconventional career track= The genre of Yanni's music made it unsuitable for most commercial radio or for music television. In 2012 Yanni expressed the importance of PBS to his career, saying that the network \\"always allowed me to present my music without any censorship or influence, and encouraged me to be the artist that I am,\\" and had been \\"a great part of my career for over 20 years.\\" Yanni took an unconventional path to recognition, for example, by risking his personal fortune to fund historic- monument events such as his 1993 Acropolis concerts, by producing specials on public television, by creating alone in his home-built studio, and by performing many of his own production duties‚Äîthus by-passing the conventional music industry. In 2000, The Washington Post's David Segal wrote that Yanni was \\"a living metaphor for 'success on your own terms,' the dream of every American with an idea that is either ridiculed or ignored.\\" =Music= In an early-career review in the Dallas Times Herald in the late 1980s, Yanni's concert with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra was described as \\"exhilarating, moving and inspiring.\\" In 1995, The Los Angeles Times' Don Heckman wrote that Yanni's music is \\"based on sweeping romantic melodies underscored with energetic Mediterranean rhythms.\\" More analytically, the Hartford Courant's Steve Metcalf \\"deconstructed\\" Yanni's music as being \\"from a harmonic standpoint, constructed of materials found in a lot of late-19th, early 20th century classical music. It is essentially tonal, tinged with mild whiffs of dissonance here and there, sometimes rhythmically frisky, graspable on first listening, and self-evidently mood-inducing. There are two basic moods to Yanni music: struttingly heroic with martial overtones, and dreamily contemplative... A kind of peaceful, easy-feeling link between pop music and classical music.\\" More recently, Allmusic's Mark Deming characterized Yanni's compositions and performances as having \\"a pronounced sense of drama, dynamics, and romanticism,\\" writing that Yanni has a \\"commanding performance style.\\" Rob Garratt wrote in The National that Yanni \\"breaks all the rules\\" in producing music \\"typically in two modes ‚Äì poundingly heroic or reflectively ambient.\\" In 2012 Howie Grapek remarked in The Palm Beach Post's PBPulse that \\"there are few modern-day composers with a unique sense of music and style which is truly their own. To compare new-age music with classic rock is a stretch, but for Yanni, it is possible. This Greek composer marries contemporary new-age spirituality with today's pop attitudes and delivers a unique sound.\\" Yanni popularized the combination of electronic music synthesizers with a full scale symphony orchestra. Having been called a \\"true global artist,\\" Yanni has employed musicians of various nationalities, and has incorporated a variety of exotic instruments from around the world from an Australian didgeridoo to a Peruvian charango, to perform with his classical orchestra, rock rhythm section, and electronic keyboards. His music is described as \\"an eclectic fusion of ethnic sounds, from Native American chants to African rhythms and Asian harmonies.\\" Before his 2015 concerts at the Egyptian Pyramids Yanni said that emotions are the same throughout the world, and that his predominantly instrumental music can communicate those emotions with people everywhere because it bypasses language. The Morning Call's John L. Moser wrote that \\"trends come and trends go,\\" but that Yanni's music \\"seems to defy trends and... feels like it's music for all time.\\" Moser interviewed the composer, asking if he intentionally tries to create \\"something that's going to last forever as opposed to something that's just going to sell 1 million copies right away,\\" Yanni replied that \\"There's no way you can create art to last forever... so you can't have that in your mind.\\" Instead, describing his creative process, Yanni explained that his knowledge of music and instruments and his experience in different cultures is a \\"primordial soup that comes together and it shows itself and it appears. And it's fluid. It's effortless.\\" Yanni's popularity with the public and his success on public television have contrasted sharply with views of some critics. The more extreme criticisms include statements that Yanni's music is \\"aural wallpaper... lacking in substance\\" or characterizing Yanni as a \\"no-talent poseur\\" whose music has little intellectual weight, while his fans' opinions have been paraphrased as calling Yanni a \\"highly original artist whose profound spirituality has created a unique kind of music.\\" In this regard, one commentator wrote in 2019 that Yanni's songs are \\"hazy and undefinable\\" and \\"unstructured in the traditional way\\", paraphrasing Yanni's statement that listeners' responses depend on the degree to which they \\"invest themselves in the music\\", which has a \\"relentless focus on feeling rather than hooks\\". Yanni claims to have had perfect pitch since childhood. He continues to use the \\"musical shorthand\\" that he developed as a child rather than employ traditional musical notation, and hires someone to perform the tedious process of making conventional written charts for orchestra members. Even so, since music is an auditory domain, Yanni must train the musicians in what cannot be conveyed in that writing. =Concerts and live streaming= The Palm Beach Post's Howie Grapek remarked about an April 2012 performance that the show was not a one-man keyboard show, but spotlighted individual long solos showcasing the band members' talents, and that Yanni \\"loves giving them the opportunity to shine individually.\\" Booth Newspapers' Jeffrey Kaczmarczyk commented that Yanni \\"has great sidemen ‚Äì always has.\\" Further, Yanni expands sound variety by using multiple interchangeable keyboards that are interconnected so that playing one keyboard can cause other keyboards to play corresponding notes emulating different instruments. Yanni's concerts, known for their lighting and other technical aspects, require over 2,000 timing cues for a show's lighting. Yanni's longtime lighting designer remarked in 2013 that the lighting is critically timed to Yanni's music itself, accommodating its variety of time signatures, further observing that since Yanni plays mostly theatrical venues rather than arenas, the lighting can include subtle moves and color. The lighting also emphasizes band members' solos, as well as specific moments in the concerts. Commenting on Yanni's \\"great lighting\\" on the stage and \\"plenty of reverb in the audience,\\" Booth Newspapers' Jeffrey Kaczmarczyk remarked that a Yanni concert \\"can be an intoxicating experience.\\" In early 2017 Yanni began his \\"An Evening in Conversation with Yanni\\" or \\"An intimate Conversation with Yanni\\" tour in which audience questions and on- stage participation guided the show, and Yanni played a piano without a band. In May-June 2019, Yanni performed a multi-night residency at New York‚Äôs Lunt- Fontanne Theatre, two videos for which topped Billboard's Top Facebook Live Videos chart before other Yanni videos topped the same chart in October December 2019, and February 2020. Honors, awards and distinctions In addition to performing at historic venues such as Royal Albert Hall (London; 1995 & 2014), Yanni has been permitted to perform at such world landmarks as the Acropolis of Athens (Greece; 1993), the Taj Mahal (Agra, India; 1997), the Forbidden City (Beijing, China; 1997), the Burj Khalifa (the world's tallest building; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; 2011), the Kremlin (Moscow, Russia; 2011), the Castillo San Felipe del Morro (\\"El Morro\\" UNESCO World Heritage Site, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, U.S. territory; 2011), the ancient city of Byblos (UNESCO World Heritage Site, Lebanon; 2013), the Roman Theatre of Carthage (Tunis, Tunisia; 2014), Laxmi Vilas Palace (Vadodara, India; 2015), the Egyptian pyramids and Great Sphinx of Giza (Egypt, 2015), the Amman Citadel (Jordan, 2016), the Prambanan Temple (Indonesia, 2019) and Al-\`Ula (UNESCO World Heritage Site, Saudi Arabia; 2019). Rising in popularity with the new age music boom of the 1980s and 1990s, Yanni's music became more well known through adult alternative radio airplay, appearances on public television and in television commercials, as well as international music tours. Yanni's music has been used in television shows and televised sporting events, including the British Open (golf), the U.S. Open (golf), the Super Bowl, Wide World of Sports, U.S. Open tennis championships, the Tour de France, the World Figure Skating Championships and the Olympic Games. He also composed music for ABC's World News Now. Yanni's \\"Acroyali/Standing in Motion\\" was determined to have the \\"Mozart effect\\" by the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine (April 2001) because the composition is similar to Mozart's K 448 in tempo, structure, melodic and harmonic consonance and predictability, characteristics thought to decrease seizure activity and to enhance spatial- temporal performance. During Yanni's October 2011 tour of China, Yanni became the first Western artist to be invited to adopt a giant panda (bear) cub at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, a \\"privilege... usually reserved for countries rather than personalities.\\" \\"Officials from the research base invited the musician to adopt the animal, saying their decision was made from the inspiration and harmony that derives from his music.\\" Yanni named the panda \\"Santorini,\\" also the name of a Greek island, explaining that the Greek word irini means 'peace'.\\" In February 2013, Yanni and Celine Dion were the first non-Chinese artists invited to perform (separately) in China at the CCTV Spring Festival Gala, a CCTV televised event with an annual audience of 700 million. Billboard named Yanni their No. 5 \\"new age album artist of 2016\\". He was named to the same list in 2014 (No. 6), 2012 (ranked No. 5), 2011 (No. 1), 2010 (No. 4), 2009 (No. 3), 2007 (No. 4), and 2006 (No. 4). Yanni's albums Dare to Dream (1992) and In My Time (1993) received Grammy Award nominations for Best New Age Album.\\" The PBS specials Live at the Acropolis and Tribute received Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Lighting Direction (Electronic) for a Drama Series, Variety Series, Miniseries, Movie or Special, in 1994 and 1998, respectively. Lee Rose and David \\"Gurn\\" Kaniski Lighting Designers. At least sixteen Yanni albums peaked at No. 1 in Billboard's \\"Top New Age Album\\" category, more than anyone except Jim Brickman and Mannheim Steamroller. In addition to earning a B.A. in psychology in 1976 from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, Yanni received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the same institution on May 6, 2004. Charitable and humanitarian activities Yanni has had a collaborative relationship with the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in its fundraising efforts since the early years of his career, reportedly raising more than $13 million for that organization. The Yanni Live at El Morro, Puerto Rico production (2012) was Yanni's tenth collaboration with PBS. Yanni has assisted the conservation efforts of the World Wide Fund for Nature (the World Wildlife Fund, WWF), sponsoring a symbolic \\"Panda Adoption Kit\\" program in which he guaranteed $50,000 in donations. Yanni has also been a spokesman for NASA. Yanni has performed concerts in troubled areas of the world, such as in Tunisia one week after the July 17, 2014, terrorist attack that killed 14, and in Egypt to convey an image of stable security after the Egyptian Crisis (2011‚Äì14) but between whose two Great Pyramids concerts occurred the October 31, 2015, terrorist downing of Metrojet Flight 9268 in the Sinai Peninsula. Autobiography Yanni's autobiography, Yanni in Words, co-authored by David Rensin, was published in February 2003, coinciding with the release of his Ethnicity album. The book became a New York Times best seller in the nonfiction category on March 2, 2003.

He is most famous for his madrigal comedies, particularly L'Amfiparnaso. Orazio Vecchi.  Life  He was born in Modena, and studied with Salvatore Essenga, a Servite monk there. In addition he prepared for holy orders with early education at the Benedictine monastery, and took holy orders sometime before 1577. By the end of the 1570s he was well-connected with the composers of the Venetian school (for example Claudio Merulo and Giovanni Gabrieli) since he collaborated with them in writing a sestina for a ducal marriage. During this period he accompanied Count Baldassare Rangoni on his travels, going to Bergamo and Brescia. He was maestro di cappella (director of music) at the Sal√≤ cathedral between 1581 and 1584. Following this, he was the choirmaster at the cathedral of Reggio Emilia, until 1586. In that year he moved to Correggio where he was appointed canon of the cathedral there; he composed copiously during his time there, though he felt isolated from the major musical centers of Italy such as Rome, Venice, Florence and Ferrara. Eventually he attempted to correct this by moving back to Modena, where he attained the rank of mansionario (a priest who also had charge of the choir). He seems to have had considerable financial difficulties during this time, which he alluded to in his letters, and occasionally in his compositions. In 1594 his madrigal comedy, L'Amfiparnaso, premiered in Modena and was published in 1597 in a lavishly illustrated edition.italianopera.org That same year he visited Venice, where he published a collection of canzonette. In addition he published a huge amount of other music that same year, evidently his complete production of the last 16 years in Correggio and the other towns. One of the pieces he published was L'Amfiparnaso, which is his best-known composition. Duke Cesare d'Este hired Vecchi in 1598 to be his maestro di corte, i.e. the master of music at his court, and Vecchi accompanied him to Rome and Florence in 1600; while in Florence he heard Jacopo Peri's opera Euridice. Afterwards he returned to Modena where he continued to serve in the cathedral until his death in 1605.  Music and influence  Vecchi was renowned for his madrigals, especially his grouping of them together in a new form called the \\"madrigal comedy.\\" This was a light, popular, and dramatic entertainment form of the late 16th century, sometimes regarded as one of the precursors to opera. In addition, Vecchi published books of canzonette, a lighter alternative to the madrigal, midway in complexity and seriousness between it and the villanella. He also composed serious madrigals, though not in the quantity of composers like Marenzio, as well as some sacred music. The sacred music in particular shows the influence of the Venetian school, with polychoral writing as well as contrasting duple- versus triple-time sections.

Formed in 1995, the band released their only studio album Get Some with founding vocalist Lynn Strait in 1997 and disbanded after his death in 1998. In 2008, the lineup of lead guitarist Mikey Doling, rhythm guitarist Sonny Mayo, bassist John Fahnestock and drummer Jamie Miller reunited. In 2009, a new band, Tons, was formed, with Brandon Espinoza as vocalist. As of February 2014, Snot has reformed again.  History  = Formation, Get Some and death of Lynn Strait (1995‚Äì1998) = The band was formed by singer Lynn Strait, the former bassist of a local punk band, Lethal Dose, and guitarist Mikey Doling, formerly of Kronix. After building a strong following with performances in Los Angeles, Snot signed with Geffen Records, and began work on their debut album, Get Some, released on May 27, 1997. Although the album received positive critical notice, sales were disappointing. The band performed on the 1998 Ozzfest tour. On July 9, 1998, Strait was arrested in Mansfield, Massachusetts, for indecent exposure after emerging nude from the oversized toilet prop used by Limp Bizkit in their performances. The band began work on their second album. On December 11, 1998, Strait died in a car accident when a truck struck his car, killing him and his boxer, Dobbs. The band disbanded following Strait's death, with Doling stating, \\"We can't go on without Lynn. It's just bullshit when bands do that.\\" =Post-death (1999‚Äì2007)= Because Strait had not recorded vocals for the album, it was decided that the album's vocal tracks would be completed by friends of Strait as a tribute. Strait Up, released on November 7, 2000, featured appearances by the lead vocalists of System of a Down, Korn, Hed PE, Soulfly, Incubus, Sevendust, Limp Bizkit, Coal Chamber, Slipknot and Sugar Ray, among others. It peaked at number 56 on the Billboard 200. A live album, Alive!, was released on July 30, 2002. It peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. On April 5, 2007, the band reunited for a performance in Anaheim, California, with vocals performed by Invitro singer Jeff Weber. =First reunion, Tons and breakup (2008‚Äì2013)= In 2008, the band reformed, with former Divine Heresy singer Tommy Vext on vocals. Tommy Cummings and Sonny Mayo left the band, and a new band, \\"Tons\\", was formed in 2009 with a new vocalist. They recorded three new songs titled \\"Ability & Control\\", \\"1000 Ways of Pain\\" and \\"Fan the Flames\\" before members of the group moved on to new projects. =Second reunion (2014‚Äìpresent)= On February 11, 2014, Snot reunited again at the Whisky a Go Go in West Hollywood. This second reunion line-up once again features Vext, Mayo, Doling, Fahnestock and Miller. They went on to play three more shows in the Southern California area before once again going quiet, although they poked at the possibility of another future U.S. tour. In August it was announced that Snot would be hitting the road once again, starting November 28 and going through December 22 all throughout the U.S. An international tour is coming in January/February. However, in October, vocalist Tommy Vext announced he had left the band to form his new band, Westfield Massacre, and that Snot already had a replacement vocalist (Carl Bensley) in place. For the European dates, Mike Smith would fill in for Sonny Mayo, who was going to be unable to tour due to business commitments.

Lucullus was sent to Hispania Citerior (Nearer Spain, on the east coast of Hispania) when the senate rejected a proposal for a peace treaty with the Celtiberians by Marcus Claudius Marcellus to end the Numantine War (154‚Äì152 BC). However, Marcellus went ahead with his plan and quickly concluded a treaty before Lucullus got there. Lucullus was disappointed and, \\"being greedy of fame and needing money because he was in straitened circumstances\\",Appian, Roman History, Book 6, The Wars in Spain, 51 he attacked the Vaccaei (a Celtiberian tribe which lived further north) who were not at war with Rome and did so without the authorisation of the senate. He claimed that they had mistreated the Carpetani as an excuse. He pitched camp by the town of Cauca (near modern Segovia) and when its people asked for peace terms he demanded, among other things, that a garrison be placed in the town. He got his soldiers to kill all the adult males. Only a few out of 20,000 escaped.Appian, Roman History, Book 6, The Wars in Spain, 51‚Äì52 Lucullus then went the city of Intercatia (Villanueva del Campo, in the modern province of Zamora) whose inhabitants, having heard about Cauca, refused to ask for terms. He struggled to seize the city, and his lieutenant, Scipio Africanus the Younger, promised the Intercatians that if they made a treaty it would not be broken. They trusted him and surrendered.Appian, Roman History, Book 6, The Wars in Spain, 53‚Äì54 Lucullus was advised not to attack the large city of Pallantia (modern Palencia), which hosted many refugees and was renowned for its bravery, but because he heard that it was a rich city he camped there. The Pallantian cavalry constantly harassed his foragers until he ran out of food and he had to withdraw. He set up winter camp in the land of the Turdetani (in modern Andalusia).Appian, Roman History, Book 6, The Wars in Spain, 55 He was imprisoned by the tribunes for attempting to enforce a troop levy too harshly. Appian emphasised the greed of Lucullus and said that he fought these campaigns for the sake of gold and silver, which he thought were abundant all over Hispania. However, the people he attacked did not have any and did not even \\"set any value on those metals\\". He added that Lucullus was never called into account for his actions.Appian, Roman History, Book 6, The Wars in Spain, 55 This was typical of the impunity of the elites which was a feature of the Roman Republic. While he was in Turdetania, the Lusitanians, who were also rebelling, carried out raids in the area. Lucullus invaded Lusitania and, according to Appian, he depopulated it. He was not meant to get involved. The war with the Lusitanians was under the jurisdiction of Servius Sulpicius Galba, the praetor of Hispania Ulterior (Further Spain, roughly modern Andalusia) and Lucullus was wintering in his province. However, Appian wrote that Galba was even more greedy than Lucullus. He let him do so and did the same on the other side of Lusitania. Galba, too, was in search for booty, and slaughtered a large number of Lusitanians by treachery. He, too, was not held to account.Appian, Roman History, Book 6, The Wars in Spain, 59‚Äì60 Lucullus built a temple dedicated to Fortuna in the Velabrum to celebrate his \\"success\\". He adorned it with statues which Lucius Mummius Achaicus, who defeated the Achaean League in Greece, had lent him. Later Mummius asked for his statues back, but Lucullus told him that it would be irresponsible because they were now dedicated to the goddess. Cassius Dio wrote that Mummius lent him his statues because of his amiable and charitable nature.Cassius Dio, Fragments of Book 22, 76 Children Lucullus was the father of the Lucius Licinius Lucullus who was praetor in 104 BC and led Roman forces against rebel Sicilian slaves in the Second Servile War (104‚Äì100 BC). He was the grandfather of Lucius Licinius Lucullus, who was consul in 74 BC, and the Roman commander in the first part of the Third Mithridatic War (74-63 BC) until 67 BC, and Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus, who was consul in 73 BC and proconsul of Macedonia in 72 BC.Arthur Keaveney, Lucullus: A Life 1992, pp. 2, 4 See also * Licinia (gens) Notes References * Appian: Roman History, Volume I, Books 1-8.1 (Loeb Classical Library), Loeb, 1989; * Arthur Keaveney, Lucullus, A Life, Gorgias Press; W/A New PostScr edition, 2009; * Cassius Dio, Roman History, Volume I, Books 25-25 (Loeb Classical Library), Loeb, 1989; Category:Ancient Roman generals Category:Roman Republican consuls Lucullus, Lucius Category:Licinii Luculli Category:2nd-century BC Romans ","title":"Lucius Licinius Lucullus (consul 151 BC)"},{"id":"333603","text":"Lucius Licinius Lucullus (; 118 BCThe only comprehensive discussion of his birthdate is that of Sumner 1973, pp. 113‚Äì14, who settles on 118 BC. as much the most likely year, with 117 a marginal possibility.‚Äì 57/56 BC) was an optimatis politician of the late Roman Republic, closely connected with Lucius Cornelius Sulla. In the culmination of over twenty years of almost continuous military and government service, he became the conqueror of the eastern kingdoms in the course of the Third Mithridatic War, exhibiting extraordinary generalship in diverse situations, most famously during the Siege of Cyzicus, 73‚Äì72 BC, and at the Battle of Tigranocerta in Armenian Arzanene, 69 BC. His command style received unusually favourable attention from ancient military experts, and his campaigns appear to have been studied as examples of skillful generalship.Cassius Dio XXXVI. In captured correspondence of Mithradates VI Eupator, Lucullus was rated as the outstanding general since Alexander (Cicero Acad.Pr.II) Lucullus returned to Rome from the east with so much captured booty that the vast sums of treasure, jewels, priceless works of art, and slaves could not be fully accounted for. On his return Lucullus poured enormous sums into private building projects, husbandry and even aquaculture projects which shocked and amazed his contemporaries by their magnitude. He also patronized the arts and sciences lavishly, transforming his hereditary estate in the highlands of Tusculum into a hotel-and-library complex for scholars and philosophers. He built the horti Lucullani, the famous Gardens of Lucullus, on the Pincian Hill in Rome, and in general became a cultural innovator in the deployment of imperial wealth. He died during the winter of 57‚Äì56 BC.Bennett 1972, p. 314 and was buried at the family estate near Tusculum. The conquest agnomen of Ponticus is sometimes falsely appended to his name in modern texts. In ancient sources it is attributed to only his consular colleague Marcus Aurelius Cotta after the latter‚Äôs capture and brutal destruction of Heraclea Pontica during the Third Mithridatic War. Contemporary sources Lucullus was included in the biographical collections of Roman leading generals and politicians, originating in the biographical compendium of famous Romans published by his contemporary Marcus Terentius Varro. Two biographies of Lucullus survive today, Plutarch's Lucullus in the famous series of Parallel Lives, in which Lucullus is paired with the Athenian aristocratic politician and Strategos Cimon, and # 74 in the slender Latin Liber de viris illustribus, of late and unknown authorship, the main sources for which appear to go back to Varro and his most significant successor in the genre, Gaius Julius Hyginus. Family and early career Lucullus was a member of the prominent gens Licinia, and of the family, or stirps, of the Luculli, which may have been descended from the ancient nobility of Tusculum. He was grandson of Lucius Licinius Lucullus, consul in 151 BC, and son of Lucius Licinius Lucullus, praetor in 104 BC, who was convicted for embezzlement during his Sicilian command (104/3) and exiled in 102/1. The family of his mother Caecilia Metella (born c. 137 BC) was one of the most powerful of the plebeian nobilitas, and was at the height of its success and influence in the last quarter of the 2nd century BC when Lucullus was born. She was the youngest child of Lucius Caecilius Metellus Calvus (consul 142 and censor 115‚Äì14), and half-sister of two of the most important members of the Optimates of their time, Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus (consul 109 and censor 102), and Lucius Caecilius Metellus Dalmaticus (consul 119 and Pontifex Maximus), who was the father of Sulla's third wife Caecilia Metella.Plutarch, Lucullus 1.1‚Äì6 His first known military service was as tribune of soldiers serving in Sulla's army in Campania during the bellum Italicum (Social War (91‚Äì88 BC)),ILS 60, Plut.Luc.2.1 when he is said to have distinguished himself for daring and intelligence.Plut.Luc.2.1 The longest Quaestura, 88‚Äì80 BC Lucullus was elected Quaestor in winter of 89-88 during the same elections Sulla was chosen as Consul with his friend Quintus Pompeius Rufus (whose son was married to Sulla's eldest daughter, Cornelia). Lucullus was probably the Quaestor mentioned as the sole officer in Sulla's army who could stomach accompanying the Consul when he marched on Rome.Appian R.Em. I, 57 records the bare facts without giving names. The suggestion that this quaestor was Lucullus was first made by Ernst Badian ('Waiting for Sulla', JRS 52 (1962), p. 54), and has found wide acceptance. In autumn of the same year Sulla sent Lucullus ahead to Greece to assess the situation while he himself oversaw the embarkation of his army. Lucullus arrived in Greece and took over from Quintus Bruttius Sura who had been able to stop the Mithridatic invasion in northern Greece.Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus, pp 20-21; Lynda Telford, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, pp 117-18; Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, p. 55. When Sulla arrived with the main army, Lucullus served him as a quaestor again; he minted money that was used during the war against Mithridates in southern Greece (87-86 BC). The money Lucullus minted, as per Roman custom, bore his name: the so called Lucullea.Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus, p. 20; Plutarch, Life of Lucullus, II. 1-2. =The naval venture, 86‚Äì85= As the Roman siege of Athens was drawing towards a successful conclusion, Sulla's strategic attention began to focus more widely on subsequent operations against the main Pontic forces, and combating Mithridates' control of the sea lanes. He sent Lucullus to collect such a fleet as may be possible from Rome's allies along the eastern Mediterranean seaboard, first to the important but currently disturbed states of Cyrene and Ptolemaic Egypt.Plut.Luc.2.2 Lucullus set out from the Piraeus in mid winter 87-6 BC with three Greek yachts (myoparones) and three light Rhodian biremes, hoping to evade the prevailing sea power of the Pontic fleets and their piratic allies by speed and taking advantage of the worst sailing conditions.Plut.Luc.2.3 He initially made Crete, and is said to have won over the cities to the Roman side. From there he crossed to Cyrene where the famous Hellenic colony in Africa was in dire condition following a vicious and exhausting civil war of nearly seven years' duration. Lucullus' arrival seems to have put a belated end to this terrible conflict, as the first official Roman presence there since the departure of the proconsul Caius Claudius Pulcher, who presided over its initial administrative incorporation into the Roman Republic in 94 BC. He then sailed to Egypt to try and secure ships from king Ptolemy IX Soter II. In Alexandria, Ptolemaic Egypt's capital, he was well received, but there would be no aid or help. Ptolemy had decided to sail a safe course between Rome and Pontus. From Alexandria Lucullus sailed to Cyprus; evading the Cilician pirates, he went to Rhodos (Rome's naval ally). The Rhodians supplied him with additional ships. Rhodos was famous for its naval strength and the marine acumen of its sailors; the Rhodian contingent would turn out to be a most welcome aid. In the waters near Rhodos Lucullus' fleet defeated a Mithridatic contingent. He then secured Cnidus and Cos, drove the Mithridatic military from Chios, and attacked Samos. From there he would work his way North. Lucullus won another victory off Cape Lecton. From Lecton Lucullus sailed to Tenedos where the Mithridatic fleet lay in wait. After Lucullus had defeated the Mithridatic admiral Neoptolemus in the Battle of Tenedos, he helped Sulla cross the Aegean to Asia. After a peace had been agreed, Lucullus stayed in Asia and collected the financial penalty Sulla imposed upon the province for its revolt. Lucullus, however, tried to lessen the burden that these impositions created.Plutarch, Life of Lucullus, 2.1-4.5 =The aftermath of the First Mithridatic War= Lucullus is noted for his magnanimous administration of Asia province; he managed to calm Rome's resentful, near rebellious, Asian subjects and establish a modicum of peace. When Asia's Roman governor, Lucius Licinius Murena, started and fought the brief, so-called Second Mithridatic War (83-81 BC), Lucullus was not involved.Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus, Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror, p. 36. Mytilene, capital of the island of Lesbos, rebelled during Lucullus administration of Asia. Lucullus tried to solve the conflict through diplomacy, but eventually he launched an attack on the city state, defeated her militia in a pitched battle in front of her walls and started a siege. After some time Lucullus pretended to give up on the siege and sailed away. When the Mytileneans entered the remnants of his camp, Lucullus ambushed them killing 500 of the enemy and enslaving 6,000.Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus, Life and Campaigns of a Roman Conqueror, pp. 36-37. Return to the west, 80‚Äì74 BC Lucullus returned in 80 BC and was elected curule aedile for 79, along with his brother Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus, and gave splendid games.Plut.Luc.1.6, Granius Licinianus 32F The most obscure part of Lucullus' public career is the year he spent as praetor in Rome, followed by his command of Roman Africa, which probably lasted the usual two-year span for this province in the post-Sullan period. Plutarch's biography entirely ignores this period, 78 BC to 75 BC, jumping from Sulla's death to Lucullus' consulate. However Cicero briefly mentions his praetorship followed by the African command,Acad.Prior II 1 while the surviving Latin biography, far briefer but more even as biography than Plutarch, comments that he \\"ruled Africa with the highest degree of justice\\".Liber de viris illustribus 74.3 This command is significant in showing Lucullus performing the regular, less glamorous, administrative duties of a public career in the customary sequence and, given his renown as a Philhellene, for the regard he showed for subject peoples who were not Greek. In these respects his early career demonstrates a generous and just nature, but also his political traditionalism in contrast to contemporaries such as Cicero and Pompey, the former of whom was always eager to avoid administrative responsibilities of any sort in the provinces, while Pompey rejected every aspect of a normal career, seeking great military commands at every opportunity which suited him, while refusing to undertake normal duties in peaceful provinces. Two other notable transactions took place in 76 or 75 BC following Lucullus' return from Africa: his marriage to Claudia, the youngest daughter of Appius Claudius Pulcher, and his purchase of the Marian hilltop villa at Cape Misenum from Sulla's eldest daughter Cornelia. Sulla dedicated his memoirs to Lucullus, and upon his death made him guardian of his son Faustus and daughter Fausta, preferring Lucullus over Pompey.Plutarch, Life of Lucullus, 4.5 =Consulship= In 74 BC Lucullus served as consul along with Marcus Aurelius Cotta, the half-brother of Aurelia the mother of Julius Caesar.Plutarch, Life of Lucullus, 5.1 During his consulship he defended Sulla's constitution from the efforts of Lucius Quinctius to undermine it.Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus, p. 49; John Leach, Pompey the Great, p. 55; B. Marshall and J.L. Beness, Athenaeum 65 (1987), pp 360-78. He supported a plea from Pompey, campaigning against the rebel Sertorius on the Iberian peninsula, for funds and reinforcements.Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus, pp 45-46. Enabling Pompey to continue fighting Sertorius, and keeping Pompey from returning to Rome and interfering with Lucullus's plans; Lucullus feared Pompey would usurp the command against Mithridates of Pontus. And he was probably involved in the decision to make Cyrene into a Roman province.Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus, p. 47 Initially, he drew Cisalpine Gaul as his proconsular command in the lots, but he got himself appointed governor of Cilicia after its governor (Lucius Octavius) died, reputedly by recommendation from Praecia. Anise K. Strong: Prostitutes and Matrons in the Roman World He also got himself the command of the Third Mithridatic War against Mithridates VI of Pontus.Plutarch, Life of Lucullus, 5.2‚Äì6.5 This was a highly sought after command for Mithridates ruled very rich lands. The Eastern Wars, 73‚Äì67 BC On his way to Cilicia, his proconsular province, Lucullus landed his legion somewhere in Asia province.Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus, pp 52-55; Appian, Mithridatica, XI.72. He initially planned to march from Asia to western Cilicia and invade Pontus from the south. In Asia province he found the two Fimbrian legions, veterans from the previous Mithridatic Wars, waiting for him. Upon hearing the news of Cotta's defeat he set out to relieve the besieged Cotta in Bithynia.Plutarch, Life of Lucullus, 7.1‚Äì36.7 ‚Äì an account of his whole governorship, by far the bulk of Plutarch's Life of Lucullus Lucullus had to fight Mithridates by land and sea therefore he assembled a large army and also raised a fleet amongst the Greek cities of Asia. With this fleet he defeated the enemy's fleet off Ilium and then off Lemnos. On land, through careful manoeuvring and trickery, he was able to trap Mithridates' army at Cyzicus. According to Appian and Plutarch Lucullus had 30,000 infantry and 1,600-2,500 cavalry while Mithridates was rumoured to have as many as 300,000 men in his force.Appian, Mithridatica, XI.72; Plutarch, Life of Lucullus, 8. Since Mithridates had superior numbers Lucullus refused to give battle, he decided to starve his enemy into submission. Lucullus blockaded Mithridates' huge army on the Cyzicus peninsula and let famine and plague do his work for him. Mithridates was able to escape Lucullus's siege, but his most of his soldiers perished at Cyzicus. The Pontic fleet tried to sail east into the Aegean, but Lucullus led his fleet against them. He captured a detachment of 13 ships between the island of Tenedos and the mainland harbor of the Achaeans. The main Pontic force, however, had drawn their ships to shore at a site difficult of approach, the small island of Neae between Lemnos and Scyros; Lucullus then sent infantry by land across Neae to their rear, killing many and forcing the rest back to sea.Keaveney, Lucullus, p. 85. Lucullus sunk or captured 32 ships of the royal fleet.Orosius 6.2.21‚Äì22. Lucullus finished off the Mithridatic army in Bithynia and then moved through Galatia (which was allied to Rome by now) into Pontus. He was wary of drawing into a direct engagement with Mithridates, due to the latter's superior cavalry. However, after several small battles and many skirmishes, Lucullus finally defeated him at the Battle of Cabira. He did not pursue Mithridates immediately, but instead he finished conquering the kingdom of Pontus and setting the affairs of Asia into order. His attempts to reform the rapacious Roman administration in Asia made him increasingly unpopular among the powerful publicani back in Rome. Mithridates had fled to Armenia and in 71 BC Lucullus sent his brother-in-law Appius Claudius Pulcher (later consul 54 BC) as envoy to the Armenian King of Kings Tigranes II to demand the surrender of the Pontic king. In the letter conveyed by Appius, Lucullus addressed Tigranes simply as \\"king\\" (basileus), something received as an insult, and probably intended as such in order to provoke the proud Armenian monarch to war. Keaveney denies such an interpretation, arguing that Lucullus was acting as a typical philhellene with no empathy towards the sensibilities of non-Greeks.A. Keaveney, Lucullus. A Life, pp. 99‚Äì102 However, this is refuted by Lucullus' conduct during his administration of Africa province (c. 77‚Äì75 BC, see above), the period of his career most conspicuously missing from the Greek biography by Plutarch. Battle of Tigranocerta, 69 BC In 69 BC Lucullus invaded Armenia. He began a siege of the new Armenian imperial capital of Tigranocerta in the Arzenene district. Tigranes returned from mopping up a Seleucid rebellion in Syria with an experienced army which Lucullus nonetheless annihilated at the Battle of Tigranocerta. This battle was fought on the same (pre-Julian) calendar date as the Roman disaster at Arausio 36 years earlier, the day before the Nones of October according to the reckoning of the time (or October 6),Plutarch Camillus 19.11, Lucullus 27.8‚Äì9 which is Julian October 16, 69 BC.See Roman calendar, sub-heading Conversion of pre-Julian dates Tigranes retired to the northern regions of his kingdom to gather another army and defend his hereditary capital of Artaxata, while Lucullus moved off south- eastwards to the kingdom of the Corduene on the frontiers of the Armenian and Parthian empires. During the winter of 69‚Äì68 BC both sides opened negotiations with the Parthian king, Arsaces XVI, who was presently defending himself against a major onslaught from his rival Phraates III coming from Bactria and the far east. In the summer of 68 BC Lucullus resumed the war against Tigranes, crossing the Anti-Taurus Range in a long march through very difficult mountain country directed at the old Armenian capital Artaxata. A major battle took place near the River Arsanias, where Lucullus once again routed the Armenian royal army. However, he had misjudged the time needed for a campaign so far into the Armenian Tablelands, where the good weather was unusually short lived, and when the first snows fell around the time of the autumn equinox his army mutinied and refused to advance any further. Lucullus led them back south to the warmer climes of northern Mesopotamia and had no trouble from his troops there despite setting them the difficult task of capturing the great Armenian fortress of Nisibis, which was quickly stormed and made the Roman base for the winter of 68‚Äì67 BC. That winter Lucullus left his army at Nisibis and, taking a small, but apparently highly mobile, escort, journeyed to Syria in an attempt to permanently exclude Tigranes from all his southern possessions. Syria had been an Armenian province since 83 BC. About a decade later the dispossessed Seleucid princes had spent two years in Rome (one of them probably during Lucullus's consulship in 74 BC) lobbying the Senate and Roman aristocracy to make them (as legitimate Seleucids with a Ptolemaic mother) kings of Egypt in place of the illegitimate Ptolemy XII Auletes. Though these brothers left Rome empty handed in about 72 BC, their plight was not forgotten and Lucullus now elevated one of them as king of Syria: Antiochus XIII, known as Asiaticus owing to the time he had spent living in Roman Asia province. Lucullus' old friend Antiochus of Ascalon accompanied him on this journey and died at Antioch. However, in his absence his authority over his army at Nisibis was seriously undermined by the youngest and wildest of the Claudian brothers, Publius Clodius Pulcher, apparently acting in the interests of Pompey, who was eager to succeed Lucullus in the Mithridatic War command. Although a brother-in-law of Lucullus, Clodius was also frater in some form (whether a first cousin frater consobrinus or uterine brother) of Pompey's wife Mucia Tertia. The long campaigning and hardships that Lucullus' troops had endured for years, combined with a perceived lack of reward in the form of plunder, had caused increasing insubordination. The more daring and ruthless veterans had probably been further encouraged by Lucullus' relatively mild acceptance of their first open mutiny in the Tablelands the previous autumn -especially the so-called Fimbrian legions who had murdered their first commander Lucius Valerius Flaccus and abandoned their second commander Gaius Flavius Fimbria. Instigated by Clodius, a series of demonstrations against the commander took place in his absence and by the time of his return he had largely lost control of his army and could not conduct further offensive operations. In addition Mithridates had returned to Pontus during the same winter, and crushed the garrison force Lucullus had left there under his legates Sornatius Barba and Fabius Hadrianus. Lucullus was left with no choice but to retreat to Pontus and Cappadocia and did so in the spring of 67 BC. Despite his continuous success in battle, Lucullus had still not captured either one of the monarchs. In 66 BC, with the majority of Lucullus' troops now openly refusing to obey his commands, but agreeing to defend Roman positions from attack, the senate sent Pompey to take over Lucullus' command, at which point Lucullus returned to Rome. Final years, 66‚Äì57 BC The opposition to him continued on his return. In his absence Pompey had shamefully usurped control over Sulla's children, contrary to the father's testament, and now in Pompeius' absence the latter's intimate and hereditary political ally Gaius MemmiusThat is, C. Memmius L. f. (tr.pl.66, pr.58) a notable orator and patron of the \\"modern\\" poets. He had married Sulla's daughter Fausta c. 70 BC, while his homonymous first-cousin C. Memmius had been the husband of Pompey's sister until killed in battle in Spain in 75. co-ordinated the opposition to Lucullus' claim to a triumph. Memmius delivered at least four speeches de triumpho Luculli Asiatico,Servius, ad Aeneid I.161, quotes from a written version of the fourth. There may have been more. and the antagonism towards Lucullus aroused by the Pompeians proved so effective that the enabling law (lex curiata) required to hold a triumph was delayed for three years. In this period Lucullus was forced to reside outside the pomerium, which curtailed his involvement in day-to-day politics centred on the Forum. Instead of returning fully to political life (although, as a friend of Cicero, he did act in some issuesPlutarch, Life of Lucullus, 42.4-43.3) he mostly retired to extravagant leisure, or, in Plutarch's words: He used the vast treasure he amassed during his wars in the East to live a life of luxury. He had splendid gardens outside the city of Rome, as well as villas around Tusculum and Neapolis. He is said to have introduced the sour cherry to Italy. The one near Neapolis included fish ponds and man-made extensions into the sea,Plutarch, Life of Lucullus, 38.2‚Äì41.6 and was only one of many elite senators' villas around the Bay of Naples. Pompey is said by Pliny to have referred often to Lucullus as \\"Xerxes in a toga\\".Pliny Natural History: Book IX p. 279 He finally triumphed in 63 BC thanks in small part to the political maneuvering of both Cato and Cicero. His triumph was remembered mostly due to him covering the Circus Flaminius with the arms of the enemies he had faced during the campaign.Plutarch, Life of Lucullus, p. 37. =Gastronome= So famous did Lucullus become for his banqueting that the word lucullan now means lavish, luxurious and gourmet. Once, Cicero and Pompey succeeded in inviting themselves to dinner with Lucullus, but, curious to see what sort of meal Lucullus ate when alone, forbade him to communicate with his slaves regarding any preparation of the meal for his guests. However, Lucullus outsmarted them, and succeeded in getting Pompey and Cicero to allow that he specify which room he would be dining in. He ordered that his slaves serve him in the Apollo Room, knowing that his service staff was schooled ahead of time as to the specific details of service he expected for each of his particular dining rooms: as the standard amount specified to be outlaid for any given dinner in the Apollo room was the large sum of 50,000 drachmae,According to Plutarch's Life of Lucullus. Plutarch goes on to say that Pompey and Cicero were less impressed about the total amount of the expense for the meal than that Lucullus could and would drop such a sum in such a quick and easy routine manner. Cicero and Pompey found themselves a short time later dining upon a most unexpectedly luxurious meal. On another occasion, the tale runs that his steward, hearing that he would have no guests for dinner, served only one not especially impressive course. Lucullus reprimanded him saying, \\"What, did not you know, then, that today Lucullus dines with Lucullus?\\"\\"Quid ais, inquit iratus Lucullus, au nesciebas Lucullum hodie cenaturum esse apud Lucullum?\\", Plutarch, Life of Lucullus, 41.1‚Äì6 Among Lucullus' other contributions to fine dining, he was responsible for bringing (a species of) the sweet cherry and the apricot to Rome, developing major facilities for aquaculture, and being the only person in Rome with the ability to provide thrushes for gastronomic purposes in every season, having his own fattening coops. Cicero once called Lucullus 'Piscinarius' - fish fancier.Tom Holland, Rubicon, p.189. Among the various edible plants associated with Lucullus is a cultivar of the vegetable Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris); which is named \\"Lucullus\\" in his honor. =Lucullus and higher learning= Lucullus was extremely well educated in Latin and Greek, and showed a keen interest in literature and philosophy from earliest adulthood. He established lifelong friendships with the Greek poet Archias of (Syrian) Antioch, who migrated to Rome around 102 BC, and with one of the leading Academic philosophers of the time, Antiochos of Ascalon. During his long delay in the royal palace at Alexandria in the summer of 86 BC Lucullus witnessed the beginning of the major schism in the Platonic Academy in the 1st century BC, the so-called Sosos Affair. His friend and companion Antiochos of Ascalon received, evidently from the Great Library, a copy of a work by the scholarch of the Academy, Philo of Larissa, so radical in its sceptical stance that Antiochos was sufficiently disturbed to doubt the attribution of authorship to his old teacher. But more recent pupils of Philo, chiefly Herakleitos of Tyre, were able to assure him of the book's authenticity. Antiochos and Herakleitos dissected it at length in Lucullus' presence, and in the ensuing weeks while the Roman party continued to await the arrival of the king from the south, Antiochos composed a vigorous polemic against Philo entitled Sosos, which marked his definitive break with Philo's so-called \\"Sceptical Academy\\", and the beginning of the separate, more conservative, school eventually called the Old Academy.Cic.Acad.Pr.II, cf. Barnes 1981:205 =Decline and death= Plutarch reports that Lucullus lost his mind towards the end of his life, intermittently developing signs of insanity as he aged. Plutarch, however, seems to be somewhat ambivalent as to whether the apparent madness was actually the result of the administration of a purported love potion or other explicable cause, hinting that his alleged precipitous mental decline (and his concomitant withdrawal from public affairs) may have been at least in part conveniently feigned in self- protection against the rise to power of his political opponents, such as the popular party, during a time in which the political stakes were often life and death.Plutarch, Life of Lucullus.

Schweickart was selected in 1963 for NASA's third astronaut group. He was the Lunar Module Pilot on the 1969 Apollo 9 mission, the first crewed flight test of the lunar module, on which he performed the first in-space test of the portable life support system used by the Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon. As backup Commander of the first crewed Skylab mission in 1973, he was responsible for developing the hardware and procedures used by the first crew to perform critical in-flight repairs of the Skylab station. After Skylab, he served for a time as Director of User Affairs in NASA's Office of Applications. Schweickart left NASA in 1977 to serve for two years as California Governor Jerry Brown's assistant for science and technology, then was appointed by Brown to California's Energy Commission for five and a half years, serving as chairman for three. In 1984‚Äì85 he co- founded the Association of Space Explorers and later in 2002 co-founded the B612 Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to defending Earth from asteroid impacts, along with fellow former astronaut Ed Lu and two planetary scientists. He served for a period as its chair before becoming its chair emeritus.  Early life and education  Rusty Schweickart was born October 25, 1935, in Neptune Township, New Jersey, and grew up on a \\"hardscrabble\\" farm of producing hay and vegetables plus raising poultry and cows. As a youth his ambition was to be a pilot and a cowboy. After graduating from Manasquan High School in 1952, he earned a B.S. in aeronautical engineering on scholarship (1956) and an M.S. in aeronautics and astronautics (1963) from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.MIT-alum Alumni list, MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology webpage. He was active in the Boy Scouts of America. He earned the rank of First Class.Joe H. Engle at scouting.org His hobbies include golf, bicycling, and hiking. He was married twice and has seven children. His family's stated annual income when he received his Massachusetts Institute of Technology scholarship after graduating high school was listed as $1,800 (~$16,623 in 2017).  Military and NASA service  Schweickart standing in front of his North American F-86 Sabre in 1963 Schweickart served in the U.S. Air Force and Massachusetts Air National Guard (101st Tactical Fighter Squadron) from 1956 to 1963, with over 4,000 hours of flight time, including 3,500 hours in high performance jet aircraft. Prior to joining NASA, Schweickart was a research scientist at the Experimental Astronomy Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and his work there involved research upper atmospheric physics, star tracking and stabilization of stellar images. His thesis for a master's degree at MIT concerned stratospheric radiance. Schweickart was chosen as part of NASA Astronaut Group 3 in October 1963. He was the youngest in the group. The third group of astronauts performed jungle training. Schweickart partnered with Clifton Williams. On March 21, 1966, he was named as the backup Pilot for Roger B. Chaffee on Apollo 1‚Äîwhich was to have been the first crewed Apollo flight but was destroyed during a ground test accident. His fellow crewmen were backup Command Pilot James McDivitt and Senior Pilot David Scott, both veterans of Project Gemini. In December 1966, this crew was promoted to fly the first crewed Earth orbital test of the Apollo Lunar Module (LM), with Schweickart as Lunar Module Pilot. = Spaceflight experience = Apollo 9 was flown in March 1969. Schweickart spent just over 241 hours in space, and performed the first extravehicular activity (EVA) of the Apollo program, testing the portable life support system that was later used by the 12 astronauts who walked on the Moon. The flight plan called for him to demonstrate an emergency transfer from the lunar module to the command module (CM) using handrails on the LM, but he began to suffer from space adaptation syndrome on the first day in orbit, forcing the postponement of the EVA. Schweickart performs an EVA standing on the lunar module porch, photographed by fellow astronaut James McDivitt inside the LM. Eventually, he improved enough to perform a relatively brief EVA with his feet restrained on the LM \\"porch\\" (a platform used in transferring to the descent ladder), while Command Module Pilot Scott performed a stand-up EVA through the open hatch of the CM. During a five-minute pause tethered outside his spacecraft, Schweickart felt he underwent a metaphysical experience as he stared at the Earth, contemplating its place in the universe. He subsequently practiced Transcendental Meditation based on his experience. = Skylab and beyond = Although Deke Slayton (who was responsible for all flight assignments as Director of Flight Crew Operations) opined that Schweickart \\"would have been a logical lunar module pilot\\" on subsequent lunar missions‚Äîindeed, the standard rotation of the era would have placed him on the backup crew for Apollo 12 and the prime crew of Apollo 15 ‚Äî\\"that bout of space sickness had everybody worried ... it didn't seem like a good idea to put him back in ... at this point.\\" Following his mission, Schweickart \\"basically called the shot that I really didn't want to be assigned to a flight until we knew more about motion sickness\\" and became \\"[a] motion sickness guinea pig\\" for six months; while \\"[he] didn't learn that much\\" during the testing, it is now accepted that as many as half of space travelers suffer from space adaptation syndrome to some extent. The protracted testing period also contributed to Schweickart not being assigned to the Apollo 12 backup crew. When he returned to Houston, \\"Al Shepard [Slayton's deputy], for whatever reason, instead of putting me back on Apollo, put me on to Skylab ... Al had his own agenda of who went where and whatnot. So I cycled into Skylab at the time.\\"http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/SchweickartRL/RLS_10-19-99.pdf Schweickart has also observed that he was \\"not one of Al's boys\\", alluding to the political liberalism that he shared with his then-wife, Clare; Slayton felt that her fervent political stances (including civil rights activism) \\"caused him a few problems with his colleagues.\\" During this period, a Houston radio broadcaster characterized Schweickart as \\"the closest thing to a freak astronaut\\" after he was photographed escorting Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on a tour of NASA's headquarters. Along with backup Science Pilot Story Musgrave and backup Pilot Bruce McCandless II, Schweickart was assigned as backup Commander of Skylab 2, the first crewed American space station mission, which flew during the spring of 1973. Following the loss of the space station's thermal shield during launch, he assumed responsibility for the development of hardware and procedures for erecting an emergency solar shade and deploying a jammed solar array wing, operations that saved the space station. After serving on the support crew of Skylab 4, Schweickart was more interested in cultivating managerial skills than \\"[going] over to the Space Shuttle development work which was under way ... by that time, I had, you know, done a lot of work on Gemini in a support role, and then, of course, everything on Apollo, and now all of this on Skylab, and to go cycle back into the very beginning of the Space Shuttle, which was not going to fly for, at that point, something like six years and best guess of anybody in the business was maybe eight years, I figured, you know, another eight years of basically going to the same kinds of meetings, making the same kinds of decisions, going to the same places ... it was like 'been there, done that.'\\" While retaining his flight status, he was reassigned to NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. as Director of User Affairs in the Office of Applications in 1974. In this capacity, he was responsible for transferring NASA technology (primarily Landsat 1 applications) to the outside world and working with technology users (including the U.S. Department of Agriculture and water resources managers) to bring an understanding of their needs into NASA. He came to regard this as a \\"thankless position\\" and a \\"very hard sell\\" to potential clients due to their intrinsic resistance to new processes; this and the dearth of immediate flight opportunities ultimately precipitated his departure from NASA in 1977.  Career after NASA  Schweickart then served for two years as California governor Jerry Brown's assistant for science and technology before being appointed by Brown to the California Energy Commission for five and a half years. Inspired by his friendship with Michael Murphy and involvement in the Esalen Institute's Soviet-American Exchange Program, Schweickart established the Association of Space Explorers (ASE) in 1984‚Äì85 along with cosmonauts Alexei Leonov, Vitaly Sevastyanov, and Georgi Grechko; the organization is open to all people who have flown in orbit around the Earth. He also chaired the ASE's near-Earth object committee, which produced a benchmark report and submitted it to the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UN COPUOS) on Asteroid Threats: A Call for Global Response. Schweickart retired from ALOHA Networks, Inc. in 1998 where he served as President and Chief Executive Officer from 1996 through 1998. ALOHA was a data communications company specializing in high performance, wireless internet access equipment. Schweickart was formerly the Executive Vice President of CTA Commercial Systems, Inc. and Director of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Systems. Schweickart led CTA's efforts in developing the GEMnet system, a second generation LEO communication satellite constellation designed to provide regular commercial electronic messaging services on a global basis. Prior to his CTA work, Schweickart founded and was President of Courier Satellite Services, Inc., a global satellite communications company that developed LEO satellites to provide worldwide affordable data services. Schweickart's satellite and telecommunications work involved him in the development of international communications regulations and policies, including participation in the 1992 and 1995 World Radiocommunication Conferences (WRC) of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). He served at the 1995 WRC as a U.S. delegate. He also worked extensively in Russia and the former Soviet Union on scientific and telecommunications matters. In 2002 he co-founded the B612 Foundation along with fellow former-astronaut Ed Lu and two planetary scientists, also serving as its Chair.Our Team  Rusty Schweickart, Chair Emeritus , B612 Foundation, SentinelMission.org website. Retrieved June 29, 2014. The B612 Foundation is a non-profit dedicated to defending Earth from asteroid impacts. Schweickart and Alexei Leonov at the 2016 Starmus Festival In May 2005 Schweickart testified before the U.S. Congress on the dangers of an asteroid impact related to 99942 Apophis. and in 2010 served as the co- chairman, along with astronaut Tom Jones, NASA Advisory Council's ad hoc Task Force on Planetary Defense. He has been an advocate of increasing NASA's annual budget by $250M‚Äì$300M over a 10-year period to more fully catalog the NEOs that can pose a threat to Earth and also provide a deflection capability.Schweickart, Russell; Johnson, Erik T.

Schweickart has also spoken and taught at the Esalen Institute, and currently serves as the B612 Foundation's Chair Emeritus.  Organizations  Schweickart is a fellow of the American Astronautical Society and the International Academy of Astronautics, and an associate fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He is also an honorary trustee and a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences.  Awards and honors  He was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal (1969) and the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale De la Vaulx Medal (1970) for his Apollo 9 flight. He also received the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Special Trustees Award (Emmy Award) in 1969 for transmitting the first live TV pictures from space. In 1973, Schweickart was also awarded the NASA Exceptional Service Medal for his leadership role in the Skylab rescue efforts. He was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1983 and the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1997. Main-belt asteroid was named in his honor. In 2012, Schweickart was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum.Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor.

In a 1976 study, Gwen Broude and Sarah Greene compared attitudes towards and frequency of homosexuality in the ethnographic studies available in the Standard cross-cultural sample. They found that out of 42 communities: homosexuality was accepted or ignored in 9; 5 communities had no concept of homosexuality; 11 considered it undesirable but did not set punishments; and 17 strongly disapproved and punished. Of 70 communities, homosexuality was reported to be absent or rare in frequency in 41, and present or not uncommon in 29.Gwen J. Broude and Sarah J.

However, in later cultures influenced by Abrahamic religions, the law and the church established sodomy as a transgression against divine law or a crime against nature. Many male historical figures, including Socrates, Lord Byron, Edward II, and Hadrian,Roman Homosexuality, Craig Arthur Williams, p.60 have had terms such as gay or bisexual applied to them; some scholars, such as Michel Foucault, have regarded this as risking the anachronistic introduction of a contemporary social construct of sexuality foreign to their times, though others challenge this.Thomas K. Hubbard, Review of David M. Halperin, How to Do the History of Homosexuality. in Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2003.09.22 The author has made adapted and expanded portions of this book available online as A Critique of Social Constructionism and Postmodern Queer Theory. A common thread of constructionist argument is that no one in antiquity or the Middle Ages experienced homosexuality as an exclusive, permanent, or defining mode of sexuality. John Boswell has countered this argument by citing ancient Greek writings by Plato, which describe individuals exhibiting exclusive homosexuality.

Among Indigenous peoples of the Americas prior to European colonization, a number of Nations had respected ceremonial and social roles for homosexual, bisexual, and gender-nonconforming individuals in their communities; in many contemporary Native American and First Nations communities, these roles still exist.Estrada, Gabriel S. 2011. \\"Two Spirits, N√°dleeh, and LGBTQ2 Navajo Gaze.\\" American Indian Culture and Research Journal 35(4):167-190.

East Asia In East Asia, same-sex love has been referred to since the earliest recorded history. Homosexuality in China, known as the pleasures of the bitten peach, the cut sleeve, or the southern custom, has been recorded since approximately 600 BCE. These euphemistic terms were used to describe behaviors, not identities (recently some fashionable young Chinese tend to euphemistically use the term \\"brokeback,\\" Êñ∑ËÉå duanbei to refer to homosexual men, from the success of director Ang Lee's film Brokeback Mountain). The relationships were marked by differences in age and social position. However, the instances of same-sex affection and sexual interactions described in the classical novel Dream of the Red Chamber seem as familiar to observers in the present, as do equivalent stories of romances between heterosexual people during the same period. Homosexuality in Japan, variously known as shudo or nanshoku, has been documented for over one thousand years and had some connections to the Buddhist monastic life and the samurai tradition. This same-sex love culture gave rise to strong traditions of painting and literature documenting and celebrating such relationships. Similarly, in Thailand, kathoey, or \\"ladyboys,\\" have been a feature of Thai society for many centuries, and Thai kings had male as well as female lovers. While kathoey may encompass simple effeminacy or transvestism, it most commonly is treated in Thai culture as a third gender. They are generally accepted by society, and Thailand has never had legal prohibitions against homosexuality or homosexual behavior. Europe AD. Found in Bittir (?), near Jerusalem The earliest Western documents (in the form of literary works, art objects, and mythographic materials) concerning same-sex relationships are derived from ancient Greece. The formal practice, an erotic yet often restrained relationship between a free-born (i.e. not a slave or freedman) adult male and a free-born adolescent, was valued for its pedagogic benefits and as a means of population control, though occasionally blamed for causing disorder. Plato praised its benefits in his early writingsPlato, Phaedrus in the Symposium but in his late works proposed its prohibition.Plato, Laws, 636D & 835E In the Symposium (182B-D), Plato equates acceptance of homosexuality with democracy, and its suppression with despotism, saying that homosexuality \\"is shameful to barbarians because of their despotic governments, just as philosophy and athletics are, since it is apparently not in best interests of such rulers to have great ideas engendered in their subjects, or powerful friendships or physical unions, all of which love is particularly apt to produce\\". Aristotle, in his Politics, dismissed Plato's ideas about abolishing homosexuality (2.4); he explains that barbarians like the Celts accorded it a special honour (2.6.6), while the Cretans used it to regulate the population (2.7.5). Youth females are depicted as surrounding Sappho in this painting of Lafond \\"Sappho sings for Homer\\", 1824 Little is known of female homosexuality in antiquity. Sappho, born on the island of Lesbos, was included by later Greeks in the canonical list of nine lyric poets. The adjectives deriving from her name and place of birth (sapphic and lesbian) came to be applied to female homosexuality beginning in the 19th century. Sappho's poetry centers on passion and love for various personages and both genders. The narrators of many of her poems speak of infatuations and love (sometimes requited, sometimes not) for various females, but descriptions of physical acts between women are few and subject to debate.Denys Page, Sappho and Alcaeus, Oxford UP, 1959, pp. 142‚Äì146. There is no evidence that she ran an academy for girls. Sappho reading to her companions on an Attic vase of c. 435 BC. In ancient Rome, the young male body remained a focus of male sexual attention, but relationships were between older free men and slaves or freed youths who took the receptive role in sex. The Hellenophile emperor Hadrian is renowned for his relationship with Antinous. However, by 390 A.D., Emperor Theodosius I made homosexuality a legally punishable offense for the passive partner: \\"All persons who have the shameful custom of condemning a man's body, acting the part of a woman's to the sufferance of alien sex (for they appear not to be different from women), shall expiate a crime of this kind in avenging flames in the sight of the people.\\" Joseph Robert Thornton, Bowers v. Hardrick: An Incomplete Constitutional Analysis, 65 U.N.C. L. Rev. 1100, 1100 n. 11 (1987) In 558, toward the end of his reign, Justinian expanded the proscription to the active partner as well, warning that such conduct can lead to the destruction of cities through the \\"wrath of God\\". Notwithstanding these regulations, taxes on brothels of boys available for homosexual sex continued to be collected until the end of the reign of Anastasius I in 618.Procopius: Secret History: XIX.

Covici, 1927; New York: Covici Friede, 1927) During the Renaissance, wealthy cities in northern Italy‚ÄîFlorence and Venice in particular‚Äîwere renowned for their widespread practice of same-sex love, engaged in by a considerable part of the male population and constructed along the classical pattern of Greece and Rome.Rocke, Michael, (1996), Forbidden Friendships: Homosexuality and male Culture in Renaissance Florence, Ruggiero, Guido, (1985), The Boundaries of Eros, But even as many of the male population were engaging in same-sex relationships, the authorities, under the aegis of the Officers of the Night, were prosecuting, fining, and imprisoning a good portion of that population.Florentine proverb, ca. 1480. After Sabadino degli Arienti in Le Porretane. Michael Rocke, Forbidden friendships: Homosexuality and Male Culture in Renaissance Florence, Oxford, 1996; p.87 The decline of this period of relative artistic and erotic freedom was precipitated by the rise to power of the moralizing monk Girolamo Savonarola.On homoeroticism in Florence and Savonarola's campaign against it, Michael Rocke, Forbidden Friendships: Homosexuality and Male Culture in Renaissance Florence (New York, 1996). More generally, on youth culture, see Richard Trexler, Public Life in Renaissance Florence (New York, 1980). The relationships of socially prominent figures, such as King James I and the Duke of Buckingham, served to highlight the issue, including in anonymously authored street pamphlets: \\"The world is chang'd I know not how, For men Kiss Men, not Women now;...Of J. the First and Buckingham: He, true it is, his Wives Embraces fled, To slabber his lov'd Ganimede\\" Mundus Foppensis, or The Fop Display'd, 1691 The anonymous Love Letters Between a Certain Late Nobleman and the Famous Mr. Wilson was published in 1723 in England and was presumed by some modern scholars to be a novel.Kimmel, Michael S. \\"Love Letters Between a Certain Late Nobleman and the Famous Mr. Wilson.\\" Issue 2; Issue 19 of Journal of Homosexuality Series: No. 19, N.

Also in 1749, the earliest extended and serious defense of homosexuality in English, Ancient and Modern Pederasty Investigated and Exemplified, written by Thomas Cannon, was published, but was suppressed almost immediately. It includes the passage: \\"Unnatural Desire is a Contradiction in Terms; downright Nonsense. Desire is an amatory Impulse of the inmost human Parts.\\"Gladfelder, Hal (May 2006) In Search of Lost Texts: Thomas Cannon's 'Ancient and Modern Pederasty Investigated and Exemplified\\", Institute of Historical Research Around 1785 Jeremy Bentham wrote another defense, but this was not published until 1978.Journal of Homosexuality () Volume: 3 Issue: 4, Volume: 4 Issue: 1 Executions for sodomy continued in the Netherlands until 1803 and in England until 1835. Between 1864 and 1880 Karl Heinrich Ulrichs published a series of twelve tracts, which he collectively titled Research on the Riddle of Man- Manly Love. In 1867 he became the first self-proclaimed homosexual person to speak out publicly in defense of homosexuality when he pleaded at the Congress of German Jurists in Munich for a resolution urging the repeal of anti- homosexual laws. Sexual Inversion by Havelock Ellis, published in 1896, challenged theories that homosexuality was abnormal, as well as stereotypes, and insisted on the ubiquity of homosexuality and its association with intellectual and artistic achievement. (reprint) Although medical texts like these (written partly in Latin to obscure the sexual details) were not widely read by the general public, they did lead to the rise of Magnus Hirschfeld's Scientific Humanitarian Committee, which campaigned from 1897 to 1933 against anti-sodomy laws in Germany, as well as a much more informal, unpublicized movement among British intellectuals and writers, led by such figures as Edward Carpenter and John Addington Symonds. Beginning in 1894 with Homogenic Love, Socialist activist and poet Edward Carpenter wrote a string of pro- homosexual articles and pamphlets, and \\"came out\\" in 1916 in his book My Days and Dreams. In 1900, Elisar von Kupffer published an anthology of homosexual literature from antiquity to his own time, Lieblingminne und Freundesliebe in der Weltliteratur. His aim was to broaden the public perspective of homosexuality beyond its being viewed simply as a medical or biological issue, but also as an ethical and cultural one. In a backlash to this, the Third Reich specifically targeted LGBT people in the Holocaust.Heinz Heger: Die M√§nner mit dem rosa Winkel. Merlin-Verlag, Hamburg 1972.

There are a handful of accounts by Arab travelers to Europe during the mid-1800s. Two of these travelers, Rifa'ah al-Tahtawi and Muhammad sl-Saffar, show their surprise that the French sometimes deliberately mis-translated love poetry about a young boy, instead referring to a young female, to maintain their social norms and morals. Among many Middle Eastern Muslim cultures egalitarian or age-structured homosexual practices were, and remain, widespread and thinly veiled. The prevailing pattern of same-sex relationships in the temperate and sub-tropical zone stretching from Northern India to the Western Sahara is one in which the relationships were‚Äîand are‚Äîeither gender-structured or age-structured or both. In recent years, egalitarian relationships modeled on the western pattern have become more frequent, though they remain rare. Same-sex intercourse officially carries the death penalty in several Muslim nations: Saudi Arabia, Iran, Mauritania, northern Nigeria, Sudan, and Yemen. Today, governments in the Middle East often ignore, deny the existence of, or criminalize homosexuality. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, during his 2007 speech at Columbia University, asserted that there were no gay people in Iran. Gay people may live in Iran, however they are forced to keep their sexuality veiled from the society, funded and encouraged by government legislation and traditional norms. =Mesopotamia= In the ancient Assyrian society, if a man were to have sex with another man of equal status or a cult prostitute, it was thought that trouble will leave him and he will have good fortune.Pritchard, p. 181. Some ancient religious Assyrian texts contain prayers for divine blessings on homosexual relationships.Gay Rights Or Wrongs: A Christian's Guide to Homosexual Issues and Ministry, by Mike Mazzalonga, 1996, p.11The Nature Of Homosexuality, Erik Holland, page 334, 2004 Freely pictured art of anal intercourse, practiced as part of a religious ritual, dated from the 3rd millennium BC and onwards.Greenberg, p. 126 Homosexuality was an integral part of temple life in parts of Mesopotamia, and no blame appears to have attached to its practice outside of worship.The Nature Of Homosexuality, Erik Holland, page 468, 2004 Despite this, homosexual relationships with royal attendants, between soldiers, and those where a social better was submissive or penetrated were treated as rape or seen as bad omens, and punishments were applied. South Asia The Laws of Manu, the foundational work of Hindu law, mentions a \\"third sex\\", members of which may engage in nontraditional gender expression and homosexual activities.Penrose, Walter (2001). Hidden in History: Female Homoeroticism and Women of a \\"Third Nature\\" in the South Asian Past, Journal of the History of Sexuality 10.1 (2001), p.4 The Kama Sutra, written in the 4th century, describes techniques by which homosexuals perform fellatio. Further, such homosexual men were also known to marry, according to the Kama Sutra: \\"There are also third-sex citizens, sometimes greatly attached to one another and with complete faith in one another, who get married together.\\" (KS 2.9.36). South Pacific In many societies of Melanesia, especially in Papua New Guinea, same-sex relationships were an integral part of the culture until the middle of the last century. The Etoro and Marind-anim for example, even viewed heterosexuality as sinful and celebrated homosexuality instead. In many traditional Melanesian cultures a prepubertal boy would be paired with an older adolescent who would become his mentor and who would \\"inseminate\\" him (orally, anally, or topically, depending on the tribe) over a number of years in order for the younger to also reach puberty. Many Melanesian societies, however, have become hostile towards same-sex relationships since the introduction of Christianity by European missionaries. Africa Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep kissing. Homosexuality in ancient Egypt is a passionately disputed subject within Egyptology: historians and egyptologists alike debate what kind of view the Ancient Egyptians society fostered about homosexuality. Only a handful of direct hints have survived to this day and many possible indications are only vague and offer plenty of room for speculation. The best known case of possible homosexuality in Ancient Egypt is that of the two high officials Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep. Both men lived and served under pharaoh Niuserre during the 5th Dynasty (c. 2494-2345 BC).Richard Parkinson: Homosexual Desire and Middle Kingdom Literature. In: The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology (JEA), vol. 81, 1995, pp. 57‚Äì76. Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep each had families of their own with children and wives, but when they died their families apparently decided to bury them together in one and the same mastaba tomb. In this mastaba, several paintings depict both men embracing each other and touching their faces nose-on-nose. These depictions leave plenty of room for speculation, because in Ancient Egypt the nose-on-nose touching normally represented a kiss. Egyptologists and historians disagree about how to interpret the paintings of Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep. Some scholars believe that the paintings reflect an example of homosexuality between two married men and prove that the Ancient Egyptians accepted same-sex relationships.Dena Connors-Millard: Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep - Evidence of Gay Relationships Exists as Early as 2400 B.C.? (English). Other scholars disagree and interpret the scenes as an evidence that Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep were twins, even possibly conjoined twins. No matter what interpretation is correct, the paintings show at the very least that Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep must have been very close to each other in life as in death. It remains unclear what exact view the Ancient Egyptians fostered about homosexuality. Any document and literature that actually contains sexually orientated stories never name the nature of the sexual deeds, but instead uses stilted and flowery paraphrases. While the stories about Seth and his sexual behavior may reveal rather negative thoughts and views, the tomb inscription of Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep may instead suggest that homosexuality was likewise accepted. Ancient Egyptian documents never clearly say that same-sex relationships were seen as reprehensible or despicable. And no Ancient Egyptian document mentions that homosexual acts were set under penalty. Thus, a straight evaluation remains problematic.Emma Brunner-Traut: Alt√§gyptische M√§rchen. Mythen und andere volkst√ºmliche Erz√§hlungen. 10th Edition. Diederichs, Munich 1991, , pp. 178‚Äì179.

Albeit not as commonly, it also occurs among the Galla [Oromo] and Somal[i].‚Äù He also noted mutual masturbation by both sexes and all ages for all three peoples, and specified that among the Harari, Uranism was practiced as often between men as between men and boys. More recently, Gamst (1969) reported homosexual relations among shepherd boys of the Cushitic-speaking Qemant (Kemant) of central Ethiopia. Among Amhara peasants, Messing (1957) found (better-accepted) male transvestites, who they view as ‚Äúgod‚Äôs mistakes.‚Äù W√§ndarw√§r√§d (‚Äúliterally male-female‚Äù) with visible male sexual characteristics, but whose structure is popularly believed to be defective. Among the Maale of southern Ethiopia, ‚Äúa small minority [of men] crossed over to feminine roles. Called ashtime, these (biological) males dressed like women, performed female tasks, cared for their own houses, and apparently had sexual relations with men,‚Äù according to Donald Donham (1990). Cross-gender homosexuality not tied to possession cults has been reported in a number of East African societies. Needham (1973) described a religious leadership role called mugawe among the Meru of Kenya which includes wearing women's clothes and hairstyle. Mugawe are frequently homosexual, and sometimes are married to a man. Bryk (1964) reported active (i.e., insertive) Kikuyu pederasts called onek. and also mentioned ‚Äúhomoerotic bachelors‚Äù among the pastoralist Nandi and Maragoli (Wanga).  Historiographic considerations  The term homosexuality was invented in the 19th century, with the term heterosexuality invented later in the same century to contrast with the earlier term. The term bisexuality was invented in the 20th century as sexual identities became defined by the predominate sex to which people are attracted and thus a label was needed for those who are not predominantly attracted to one sex. This points out that the history of sexuality is not solely the history of different-sex sexuality plus the history of same-sex sexuality, but a broader conception viewing of historical events in light of our modern concept or concepts of sexuality taken at its most broad and/or literal definitions. Historical personalities are often described using modern sexual identity terms such as straight, bisexual, gay or queer. Those who favour the practice say that this can highlight such issues as discriminatory historiography by, for example, putting into relief the extent to which same-sex sexual experiences are excluded from biographies of noted figures, or to which sensibilities resulting from same-sex attraction are excluded from literary and artistic consideration of important works, and so on. As well as that, an opposite situation is possible in the modern society: some LGBT-supportive researchers stick to the homosexual theories, excluding other possibilities. However, many, especially in the academic world, regard the use of modern labels as problematic, owing to differences in the ways that different societies constructed sexual orientation identities and to the connotations of modern words like queer. For example, in many societies same-sex sex acts were expected, or completely ignored, and no identity was constructed on their basis at all. Academic works usually specify which words will be used and in which context. Readers are cautioned to avoid making assumptions about the identity of historical figures based on the use of the terms mentioned above. = Ancient Greece = Greek men had great latitude in their sexual expression, but their wives were severely restricted and could hardly move about the town unsupervised if she was old enough that people would ask whose mother she was, not whose wife she was. Men could also seek adolescent boys as partners as shown by some of the earliest documents concerning same-sex pederastic relationships, which come from Ancient Greece. Though slave boys could be bought, free boys had to be courted, and ancient materials suggest that the father also had to consent to the relationship. Such relationships did not replace marriage between man and woman, but occurred before and during the marriage. A mature man would not usually have a mature male mate, but there were exceptions (among whom Alexander the Great) He would be the erastes (lover) to a young eromenos (loved one). Dover suggests that it was considered improper for the eromenos to feel desire, as that would not be masculine. Driven by desire and admiration, the erastes would devote himself unselfishly by providing all the education his eromenos required to thrive in society. In recent times, Dover's theory suggests that questioned in light of massive evidence of ancient art and love poetry, a more emotional connection than earlier researchers liked to acknowledge. Some research has shown that ancient Greeks believed semen to be the source of knowledge and that these relationships served to pass wisdom on from the erastes to the eromenos. = Ancient Rome = The \\"conquest mentality\\" of the ancient Romans shaped Roman homosexual practices.Eva Cantarella, Bisexuality in the Ancient World (Yale University Press, 1992, 2002, originally published 1988 in Italian), p. xi; Marilyn B. Skinner, introduction to Roman Sexualities (Princeton University Press, 1997), p. 11. In the Roman Republic, a citizen's political liberty was defined in part by the right to preserve his body from physical compulsion or use by others;Thomas A.J. McGinn, Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 326. for the male citizen to submit his body to the giving of pleasure was considered servile.Catharine Edwards, \\"Unspeakable Professions: Public Performance and Prostitution in Ancient Rome,\\" in Roman Sexualities, pp. 67‚Äì68. As long as a man played the penetrative role, it was socially acceptable and considered natural for him to have same-sex relations, without a perceived loss of his masculinity or social standing.Amy Richlin, The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), p. 225, and \\"Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the cinaedus and the Roman Law against Love between Men,\\" Journal of the History of Sexuality 3.4 (1993), p. 525. Sex between male citizens of equal status, including soldiers, was disparaged, and in some circumstances penalized harshly.Sara Elise Phang, Roman Military Service: Ideologies of Discipline in the Late Republic and Early Principate (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 93. The bodies of citizen youths were strictly off-limits, and the Lex Scantinia imposed penalties on those who committed a sex crime (stuprum) against a freeborn male minor.Plutarch, Moralia 288a; Thomas Habinek, \\"The Invention of Sexuality in the World-City of Rome,\\" in The Roman Cultural Revolution (Cambridge University Press, 1997), p. 39; Richlin, \\"Not before Homosexuality,\\" pp. 545‚Äì546. Scholars disagree as to whether the Lex Scantinia imposed the death penalty or a hefty fine. Male slaves, prostitutes, and entertainers or others considered infames (of no social standing) were acceptable sex partners for the dominant male citizen to penetrate. \\"Homosexual\\" and \\"heterosexual\\" were thus not categories of Roman sexuality, and no words exist in Latin that would precisely translate these concepts.Craig Williams, Roman Homosexuality (Oxford University Press, 1999, 2010), p. 304, citing Saara Lilja, Homosexuality in Republican and Augustan Rome (Societas Scientiarum Fennica, 1983), p. 122. A male citizen who willingly performed oral sex or received anal sex was disparaged. In courtroom and political rhetoric, charges of effeminacy and passive sexual behaviors were directed particularly at \\"democratic\\" politicians (populares) such as Julius Caesar and Mark Antony.Catharine Edwards, The Politics of Immorality in Ancient Rome (Cambridge University Press, 1993), pp. 63‚Äì64. Until the Roman Empire came under Christian rule,Michael Groneberg, \\"Reasons for Homophobia: Three Types of Explanation,\\" in Combatting Homophobia: Experiences and Analyses Pertinent to Education (LIT Verlag, 2011), p. 193. there is only limited evidence of legal penalties against men who were presumably \\"homosexual\\" in the modern sense.Williams, Roman Homosexuality, pp. 214‚Äì215; Richlin, \\"Not before Homosexuality,\\" passim. = The Middle Ages = Two males, Richard Puller von Hohenburg and Anton M√§tzler, accused of sodomy burned at the stake, Zurich 1482 (Zurich Central Library) Through the medieval period, homosexuality was generally condemned and thought to be the moral of the story of Sodom and Gomorrah. Historians debate if there were any prominent homosexuals and bisexuals at this time, but it is argued that figures such as Edward II, Richard the Lionheart, Philip II Augustus, and William Rufus were engaged in same-sex relationships. Also, historian Allan A. Tulchin recently argued that a form of male same-sex marriage existed in Medieval France, and possibly other areas in Europe, as well. There was a legal category called \\"enbrotherment\\" (affr√®rement) that allowed two men to share living quarters, pool their resources, and effectively live as a married couple. The couple shared \\"one bread, one wine, one purse.\\"Allan A. Tulchin, \\"Same-Sex Couples Creating Households in Old Regime France: The Uses of the Affr√®rement,\\" The Journal of Modern History.

The article received considerable attention in the English-language press, since Tulchin may have discovered the earliest form of same-sex marriage.The Telegraph , NPR Tulchin's views have also sparked significant controversy, as they challenge the generally held view that the medieval period was one of the most anti-gay in history. = Renaissance = *Chaucer's Pardoner Monica E.

In 1948 Alfred Kinsey publishes Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, popularly known as the Kinsey Reports. Homosexuality was deemed to be a psychiatric disorder for many years, although the studies this theory was based on were later determined to be flawed. In 1973 homosexuality was declassified as a mental illness in the United Kingdom. In 1986 all references to homosexuality as a psychiatric disorder were removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association.  The sexual revolution  During the Sexual Revolution, the different-sex sexual ideal became completely separated from procreation, yet at the same time was distanced from same-sex sexuality. Many people viewed this freeing of different-sex sexuality as leading to more freedom for same- sex sexuality.

After a siege of nine days, Gallus decided to fall back to the coast. His decision appears to have been based on the loss of siege equipment by ambush and the threatened cutting of his supply lines as the October rains began. The war-like faction in Jerusalem, under Shimon bar Giora, rose up against the Roman contingent, pursuing them as far as Antipatris, via Beit Horon.James J. Bloom, The Jewish Revolts Against Rome, A.D. 66‚Äì135, Jefferson, North Carolina 2010, pp. 84‚Äì85 Cf. Josephus, De Bello Judaico (The Jewish War) 2.19.2; 2.19.9 Josephus initially estimated the number of Roman losses at 515, but in the ensuing rout, the dead among the Imperial Roman army numbered 5300 infantrymen, and 380 cavalrymen. This incident befell the Roman army in the lunar month of Heshvan, during the 12th year of the reign of Nero, and marked the beginning of the war with Rome. Death Soon after his return to Syria, and before the spring of 67, Gallus died. According to Titus Flavius Josephus the legate was broken by shame at a major and unexpected Roman defeat. Gallus was succeeded in the governorship of Syria by Licinius Mucianus. Emperor Nero appointed the future Emperor Vespasian as commander of the Roman forces assembled in the province to crush the rebellion in Judea.

Located in Scarborough, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the campus is set upon suburban parkland in the residential neighbourhood of Highland Creek. It was established in 1964 as Scarborough College, a constituent college of the Faculty of Arts and Science. The college expanded following its designation as an autonomic division of the university in 1972 and gradually became an independent institution. Academics of the campus are centered on a variety of undergraduate studies in the disciplines of management, arts and sciences, whilst also hosting limited postgraduate research programs. Its neuroscience program was the first to be offered in the nation. The campus is noted for being the university's sole provider of cooperative education programs, as well as the Bachelor of Business Administration degree. Through affiliation with the adjacent Centennial Science and Technology Centre of Centennial College, it also offers enrolment in joint programs. The campus has traditionally held the annual F. B. Watts Memorial Lectures, which has hosted internationally renowned scholars since 1970. Its nuclear magnetic resonance laboratory was the first of its kind in Canada, allowing the campus to conduct influential research in the environmental sciences. The original building of the campus was internationally acclaimed for its architectural design. The Dan Lang Field, home to the baseball team of the Toronto Varsity Blues, is also situated at the campus. History The land along the valley of the Highland Creek in Scarborough, Ontario was purchased in 1911 by Toronto-based businessman Miller Lash, who developed the site into his summer estate with a mansion, today known as the Miller Lash House. The mansion included 17 rooms, a barn, a coach house, and three houses for his staff to dwell. Over the following years, over 100 acres of the estate was also used as farmland. Following the death of Miller Lash in 1941, the estate was acquired by E. L. McLean, an insurance broker, in 1944 for $59,000. He made new additions to the estate, including a swimming pool and change room, and a retaining wall made in stone. About of property was later purchased from McLean, just before his death, by the University of Toronto for about $650,000 in 1963, as part of the university's regional expansion. The groundskeeper of the land would continue to reside in the Highland Creek valley for the next 29 years. McLean's additions to the Miller Lash House, which would eventually become the residence of the campus's principal, were modernized and of surrounding land north of the estate were also acquired. The University of Toronto established the Scarborough College as part of the institution's collegiate university system and declared the campus as a branch of the Faculty of Arts and Science. D. C. Williams was appointed as the principal of Scarborough College and the planned Erindale College, as well as vice-president of the university. The college's faculty, consisting of 16 members, was also established and headquartered at the main campus in Downtown Toronto. First classes were held at Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute and Old Biology Building at the St. George campus. Designed by John Andrews, the first building of the campus began construction the following year. Due to delays in construction after a strike among workers, the Scarborough College opened in temporary classes at the main campus to 191 full-time students in 1965. The first building was completed in time for the following academic year. The college included a television production studio. This was for a unique video lecturing system the college was initially planned to have, that relies on the use of closed circuit television for teaching purposes. The system grabbed international media attention, and was complimented in the 1967 edition of Time. However, the video lecturing system was abandoned after it was condemned for the lack of communicability of students with instructors. In 1972, the campus was reorganized as a separately governed division of the university's Faculty of Arts and Science, developing its own curriculum. In 1973, it became the first post-secondary institution to adopt a course credit system in Ontario and the first cooperative education program was established. The campus adopted its present official name in 2006 after being renamed University of Toronto Scarborough Campus in 1983 and University of Toronto at Scarborough in 1996. The initials UTSC comes from the former name and continues to be used by the university to distinguish the campus from University of Toronto Schools (UTS). Grounds =Campus= For much of its existence, the University of Toronto Scarborough was described as a \\"mid-sized university campus\\". It is the smallest of the three campuses of the University of Toronto by area. It sits on of land, forming the west side of the Highland Creek neighbourhood in Scarborough. It is bounded entirely by Morningside Avenue to the west. Its eastern, northern and southern borders are not definite, however; the campus grounds extend north slightly south of Highway 401 and extends south slightly north of Old Kingston Road. Its eastern boundary is Military Trail while south of Ellesmere Road and slightly further east while north of Ellesmere Road. Unlike the university's downtown campus, the University of Toronto Scarborough is located in a suburban area, consisting of residential houses along its eastern side and urban forestry on its southern and western side. The neighbourhood's namesake river runs through the southern portion of the grounds and its valley consists of pedestrian trails that link the campus to nearby parks and neighbourhoods. Transit bus service by the Toronto Transit Commission, GO Transit, and Durham Region Transit connect the campus to nearby transportation hubs. =Architecture= Looking west: Science Wing ahead, Bladen Building on the left, and the Arts and Administration Building on the right. The Andrews Building, the first completed building of the campus named after its designer, John Andrews, was built in a brutalist architectural style and completed in 1964. The interiors were made to mimic streets of a city, with wide hallways and balconies on upper floors. The building is divided into two wings, known as the Science Wing and the Humanities Wing. The Meeting Place, a large atrium at the center of both wings, is often used to hold events. The design of the Andrews Building, along with its unique closed circuit television teaching system, were targets of international acclaim during the decade. The 1970s and onward saw new buildings being designed in a modernist style. The Recreational Wing, now known as the Bladen Wing (named after Vincent Bladen, former dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science) was completed in 1972. The Recreation Wing (R-Wing) housed the University of Toronto Scarborough Library, then known as the Vincent W. Bladen Library. The N'Sheemaehn Child Care Centre, one of the university's non-profit child day care facilities, opened in 1990. An underground corridor completed in 1995, known as the Hall of Excellence, connects the R-Wing (Bladen Wing) and the H-Wing (Humanities Wing). Double cohort brought challenges to the teaching, study and residence spaces at the campus due to increase in first-year enrollment. In response, the Academic Research Centre (ARC) and Joan Foley Hall were constructed. The ARC was built in 2003 as an extension of the Bladen Building with a copper finish. It allowed for the relocation and expansion of the library to its present state and introduced the campus's first 300-seat lecture theatre, which has since held the Watts Lecture series, after formerly being held in the Meeting Place. The Doris McCarthy Gallery, also found in the ARC, exhibits works by local artist and campus alumni, Doris McCarthy. The Student Centre was opened in 2004 through a project that was initiated and funded by students. Constructed using 18 tonnes of recycled steel from a demolished gallery at the Royal Ontario Museum, the three-storey Student Centre earned a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification as well as a Green Design Award from the City of Toronto. The Social Sciences Building, home of the Department of Social Sciences, also opened in 2004 as the Management Wing but took its present name after the completion of the Instructional Centre in 2011, which became the new home of the Department of Management, the Department of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, and offices of cooperative education programs. Brick and limestone were used to create the Arts and Administration Building, completed in 2005, which holds the principal's office. The Science Research Building, where post- graduate research facilities and a lecture hall are located, is an extension of the Science Wing that was completed in 2008. =Expansion= Since 2009, the university has undertaken a proposal to substantially expand the campus north of Ellesmere Road, starting with the construction of the Instructional Centre, funded by Canada's Economic Action Plan, completed in 2011. The Toronto Pan Am Sports Centre (built 2014) was one of the main venues of the 2015 Pan American Games and 2015 Parapan American Games. The Toronto Pan Am Sports Centre brought pool facility to campus and significantly expanded the size of the gym. The Parapan American Games also brought an addition of seven accessible tennis courts to the Highland Creek valley. The Environmental Science and Chemistry Building, completed in summer 2015, was the third building to open in the north grounds. The most recent addition to campus architecture is Highland Hall, built on the footprint of the old gym and athletic centre. Highland Hall houses the Registrar's Office, Admissions & Recruitment, and an Event Centre. Plans for expansion in the near future include a second Instructional Centre, a new student residence , and an indigenous house DiFrancesco, Alexa, (2020), , Varsity Academics The University of Toronto Bookstore operates a branch at Scarborough. The campus is primarily an undergraduate institution, thus it attracts the most direct- entry applicants from secondary schools among the university's three campuses. The campus has 13 academic departments: the Department of Anthropology, the Department of Arts, Culture and Media, the Department of Biological Sciences, the Department of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, the Department of English, the Department of Historical and Cultural Studies, the Department of Human Geography, the Department of Management, the Department of Philosophy, the Department of Physical & Environmental Sciences, the Department of Political Science, the Department of Psychology and the Department of Sociology.

Three graduate programs are based on the campus. The Department of Physical & Environmental Sciences offers masters and doctoral degrees in environmental science. The Department of Psychology offers an MA and PhD combined program in clinical psychology. Student life =Student centre= The Student Centre is a landmark for student activities at the campus. The Student Centre is a three-story building, where the office of the Scarborough Campus Students' Union (SCSU), office of Student Affairs of the University of Toronto Scarborough, as well as other offices of student clubs and organizations, are located. It also contains a television lounge, food court, health and wellness centre, and multifaith prayer room. The Rex's Den is a pub and dine-in restaurant located in the first floor of the Student Centre. It was formerly operated as The Bluffs, which opened subsequently after the opening of the Student Centre but re-opened with its present name and improved service in 2009. =Media and Greek life= Student media on the campus include Radio Forward (formerly Fusion Radio), the campus's student-run internet radio station, and The Underground, the campus's official student news outlet. The campus also receives distributions of The Varsity. Greek life at University of Toronto Scarborough includes two sororities: Chi Sigma Xi multicultural sorority and Delta Alpha Theta - Gamma chapter. In addition to this there is also one fraternity Xi Alpha Pi multicultural fraternity. None of these organizations have a house. As per their policy, the University of Toronto does not officially recognize neither fraternities nor sororities. =Residences= Student residence is located primarily in the southernmost part of the campus, consisting mostly of townhouse-style homes and the Student Centre. The first residence area, the Student Village, which was able to accommodate 250 students, was opened in 1973 after pressure from traveling students. The townhouses are split into different halls, each bearing a different type of wood's name, in alphabetical order. These 'Phase 1' houses, the ones originally part of the Student Village, include Aspen, Birch, Cedar, Dogwood, and Elm hall. The next 'Phase 2' halls erected include Fir, Grey Pine, Hickory, and Ironwood hall. 'Phase 3' are the townhouses located north of the main campus, near the Science Research building, include Juniper, Koa, Larch, and Maple Hall. Over 600 people can live in the townhouses. The townhouses feature shared common areas, kitchens, and bathrooms for students. The four-story-high Joan Foley Hall, opened in 2003, is the first apartment- style residence complex on campus, named after the campus's first female principal. It accommodates 230 people. It is a suite-style dorm with shared common areas, kitchens, and bathrooms per unit. The building is equipped with an elevator. It is located in the Southern Residence area. The Student Residence Centre, a white building located next to Joan Foley Hall, is where the administration for the housing is run, and acts as a common area for all residence students. It handles all mail for students, and has some supplies such as garbage bags and light bulbs available for students to use. All housing has both shared and single bedrooms available, as well as housing periods dependent upon semester. Student housing has a 'first-year guarantee' where first-years who apply before a certain deadline are guaranteed to find housing. Notable alumni Noted professors and researchers at the University of Toronto Scarborough include poet Daniel Scott Tysdal, historian and author Modris Eksteins, and Laura-Ann Petitto, a multiple award-winning American cognitive neuroscientist and psychologist who has performed influential research in various branches of neuroscience using humans and chimpanzees.

It is led mainly by scientists, former astronauts and engineers from the Institute for Advanced Study, Southwest Research Institute, Stanford University, NASA and the space industry. As a non-governmental organization it has conducted two lines of related research to help detect NEOs that could one day strike the Earth, and find the technological means to divert their path to avoid such collisions. It also assisted the Association of Space Explorers in helping the United Nations establish the International Asteroid Warning Network, as well as a Space Missions Planning Advisory Group to provide oversight on proposed asteroid deflection missions. In 2012, the foundation announced it would design and build a privately financed asteroid-finding space observatory, the Sentinel Space Telescope, to be launched in 2017‚Äì2018. Once stationed in a heliocentric orbit around the Sun similar to that of Venus, Sentinel's supercooled infrared detector will help identify dangerous asteroids and other NEOs that pose a risk of collision with Earth. In the absence of substantive planetary defense provided by governments worldwide, B612 is conducting a fundraising campaign to cover the Sentinel Mission, estimated at $450 million for 10 years of operation. Fund raising has been very slow‚Äîraising only in 2012 and 2013‚Äîand, as of June 2015, NASA is re- examining its reliance on private sector approach to space-based NEO survey missions. The B612 Foundation is named for the asteroid home of the eponymous hero of Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry's 1943 book The Little Prince. In April 2018, the B612 Foundation reported \\"It's a 100 per cent certain we'll be hit [by a devastating asteroid], but we're not 100 per cent sure when.\\" Also in 2018, physicist Stephen Hawking, in his final book Brief Answers to the Big Questions, considered an asteroid collision to be the biggest threat to the planet. In June 2018, the US National Science and Technology Council warned that America is unprepared for an asteroid impact event, and has developed and released the \\"National Near-Earth Object Preparedness Strategy Action Plan\\" to better prepare. According to expert testimony in the United States Congress in 2013, NASA would require at least five years of preparation before a mission to intercept an asteroid could be launched.  Background  When an asteroid enters the planet's atmosphere it becomes known as a 'meteor'; those that survive and fall to the Earth's surface are then called 'meteorites'. While basketball-sized meteors occur almost daily, and compact car-sized ones about yearly, they usually burn up or explode high above the Earth as bolides, (fireballs), often with little notice. During an average 24-hour period, the Earth sweeps through some 100 million particles of interplanetary dust and pieces of cosmic debris, only a very minor amount of which arrives on the ground as meteorites. The 1,200 meter-wide Meteor Crater in Arizona, United States, created by a 46 meter-diameter asteroid impact. A visitors centre is visible beyond the far rim. The larger in size asteroids or other near-Earth objects (NEOs) are, the less frequently they impact the planet's atmosphere ‚Äî large meteors seen in the skies are extremely rare, while medium-sized ones are less so, and much smaller ones are more commonplace. Although stony asteroids often explode high in the atmosphere, some objects, especially iron- nickel meteors and other types descending at a steep angle, can explode close to ground level or even directly impact onto land or sea. In the U.S. State of Arizona, the Meteor Crater (officially named Barringer Crater) formed in a fraction of a second as nearly 160 million tonnes of limestone and bedrock were uplifted, creating its crater rim on formerly flat terrain. The asteroid that produced the Barringer Crater was only about in size; however it impacted the ground at a velocity of and struck with an impact energy of ‚Äî about 625 times greater than the bomb that destroyed the city of Hiroshima during World War II. Tsunamis can also occur after a medium-sized or larger asteroid impacts an ocean surface or other large body of water. Asteroid 4179 Toutatis, one of many objects that could pose a severe catastrophic threat The probability of a mid-sized asteroid (similar to the one that destroyed the Tunguska River area of Russia in 1908) hitting Earth during the 21st century has been estimated at about 30%.Hernandez, Vittorio. Former NASA Astronaut Predicts 30% Chance of Near-Earth Asteroid Hit Within Century, International Business Times, March 21, 2013. Since the Earth is currently more populated than in previous eras, there is a greater risk of large casualties arising from a mid-sized asteroid impact. However, as of the early 2010s, only about a half of one per cent of Tunguska-type NEOs had been located by astronomers using ground-based telescope surveys. The need for an asteroid detection program has been compared to the need for monsoon, typhoon, and hurricane preparedness. As the B612 Foundation and other organizations have publicly noted, of the different types of natural catastrophes that can occur on our planet, asteroid strikes are the only one that the world now has the technical capability to prevent. B612 is one of several organizations to propose detailed dynamic surveys of NEOs and preventative measures such as asteroid deflection. Other groups include Chinese researchers, NASA in the United States, NEOShield in Europe, as well as the international Spaceguard Foundation. In December 2009 Roscosmos Russian Federal Space Agency director Anatoly Perminov proposed a deflection mission to the asteroid 99942 Apophis, which at the time had been thought to pose a risk of collision with Earth. = Asteroid deflection workshop = The Foundation evolved from an informal one- day workshop on asteroid deflection strategies during October 2001, organized by Dutch astrophysicist Piet Hut along with physicist and then-U.S. astronaut Ed Lu, presented at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Twenty researchers participated, principally from various NASA facilities plus the non-profit Southwest Research Institute, but as well from the University of California, University of Michigan, and the Institute for Independent Study. All were interested in contributing to the proposed creation of an asteroid deflection capability. The seminar participants included Rusty Schweickart, a former Apollo astronaut, and Clark Chapman, a planetary scientist. Among the proposed experimental research missions discussed were the alteration of an asteroid's spin rate, as well as changing the orbit of one part of a binary asteroid pair. Following the seminar's round-table discussions the workshop generally agreed that the vehicle of choice (needed to deflect an asteroid) would be powered by a low-thrust ion plasma engine. Landing a nuclear-powered plasma engined pusher vehicle on the asteroid's surface was seen as promising, an early proposal that would later encounter a number of technical obstacles. Nuclear explosives were seen as \\"too risky and unpredictable\\" for several reasons, warranting the view that gently altering an asteroid's trajectory was the safest approach‚Äîbut also a method requiring years of advance warning to successfully accomplish.  B612 Project and Foundation  The October 2001 asteroid deflection workshop participants created the \\"B612 Project\\" to further their research. Schweickart, along with Drs. Hut, Lu and Chapman, then formed the B612 Foundation on October 7, 2002, with its first goal being to \\"significantly alter the orbit of an asteroid in a controlled manner\\". Schweickart became an early public face of the foundation and served as Chair on its board of directors. In 2010, as part of an ad hoc task force on planetary defense, he advocated increasing NASA's annual budget by $250M‚Äì$300 million over a 10-year period (with an operational maintenance budget of up to $75 million per year after that) in order to more fully catalog the near-Earth objects (NEOs) that can pose a threat to Earth, and to also fully develop impact avoidance capabilities. That recommended level of budgetary support would permit up to 10‚Äì20 years of advance warning in order to create a sufficient window for the required trajectory deflection. Their recommendations were made to a NASA Advisory Council, but were ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining Congressional funding due to NASA, lacking a legislated mandate for planetary protection, not being permitted to request it. Feeling it would be imprudent to continue waiting for substantive government or United Nations action, B612 began a fundraising campaign in 2012 to cover the approximate US$450 million cost for the development, launch and operations of an asteroid-finding space telescope, to be called Sentinel, with a goal of raising $30 to $40 million per year. The space observatory's objective would be to accurately survey NEOs from an orbit similar to that Venus, creating a large dynamic catalog of such objects that would help identify dangerous Earth-impactors, deemed a necessary precursor to mounting any asteroid deflection mission. \\"Assessing the Risks, Impacts and Solutions for Space Threats\\"; testimony before a U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Science & Space, March 2013 (video) In March and April 2013, several weeks after the Chelyabinsk meteor explosion injured some 1,500 people, the U.S. Congress held hearings for \\"...the Risks, Impacts and Solutions for Space Threats\\". They received testimony from B612 head Ed Lu (see video at right), as well as Dr. Donald K. Yeomans, head of NASA's NEO Program Office, Dr. Michael A'Hearn of the University of Maryland and co-chair of a 2009 U.S. National Research Council study on asteroid threats, plus others. The difficulty of quickly intercepting an imminent asteroid threat to Earth was made apparent during the testimony: As a result of a set of hearings by the NASA Advisory Committee following the Chelyabinsk explosion in 2013, in conjunction with a White House request to double its budget, NASA's Near Earth Object Program funding was increased to $40.5 M/year in its FY2014 (Fiscal Year 2014) budget. It had previously been increased to $20.5 M/year in FY2012 (about 0.1% of NASA's annual budget at the time), from an average of about $4 M/year between 2002 and 2010. = Asteroid hazard reassessment = On Earth Day, April 22, 2014, the B612 Foundation formally presented a revised assessment on the frequency of \\"city-killer\\" type impact events, based on research led by Canadian planetary scientist Peter Brown of the University of Western Ontario's (UWO) Centre for Planetary Science and Exploration. Dr. Brown's analysis, \\"A 500-Kiloton Airburst Over Chelyabinsk and An Enhanced Hazard from Small Impactors\\", published in the journals Science and Nature, was used to produce a short computer-animated video that was presented to the media at the Seattle Museum of Flight. The nearly one and a half minute video displayed a rotating globe with the impact points of about 25 asteroids measuring more than one, and up to 600 kilotons of blast force, that struck the Earth from 2000‚Äì2013 (for comparison, the nuclear bomb that destroyed Hiroshima was equivalent to about 16 kilotons of TNT blast force). Of those impacts between 2000 and 2013, eight of them were as large, or larger, than the Hiroshima bomb. Only one of the asteroids, 2008 TC3, was detected in advance, some 19 hours before exploding in the atmosphere. As was the case with the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor, no warnings were issued for any of the other impacts. At the presentation, alongside former NASA astronauts Dr. Tom Jones and Apollo 8 astronaut Bill Anders, Foundation head Ed Lu explained that the frequency of dangerous asteroid impacts hitting Earth was from three to ten times greater than previously believed a dozen or so years ago (earlier estimates had pegged the odds as one per 300,000 years). The latest reassessment is based on worldwide infrasound signatures recorded under the auspices of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, which monitors the planet for nuclear explosions. Dr. Brown's UWO study used infrasound signals generated by asteroids that released more than a kiloton of TNT explosive force. The study suggested that \\"city-killer\\" type impact events similar to the Tunguska event of 1908 actually occur on average about once a century instead of every thousand years, as was once previously believed. The 1908 event occurred in the remote, sparsely populated Tunguska area of Siberia, Russia, and is attributed to the likely airburst explosion of an asteroid or comet that destroyed some 80 million trees over 2,150 square kilometres (830 sq mi) of forests. The higher frequency of these types of events is interpreted as meaning that \\"blind luck\\" has mainly prevented a catastrophic impact over an inhabited area that could kill millions, a point made near the video's end. = 99942 Apophis = During the first decade of the 2000s, there were serious concerns the 325 metres (1,066 ft) wide asteroid 99942 Apophis posed a risk of impacting Earth in 2036. Preliminary, incomplete data by astronomers using ground-based sky surveys resulted in the calculation of a Level 4 risk on the Torino Scale impact hazard chart. In July 2005, B612 formally asked NASA to investigate the possibility that the asteroid's post-2029 orbit could be in orbital resonance with Earth, which would increase the likelihood of a future impact. The Foundation also asked NASA to investigate whether a transponder should be placed on the asteroid to enable more accurate tracking of how its orbit would be changed by the Yarkovsky effect. By 2008, B612 had provided estimates on a 30 kilometers-wide corridor, called a \\"path of risk\\", that would extend across the Earth's surface if an impact were to occur, as part of its effort to develop viable deflection strategies. The calculated risk-path extended from Kazakhstan across southern Russia through Siberia, across the Pacific, then right between Nicaragua and Costa Rica, crossing northern Colombia and Venezuela, and ending in the Atlantic just before reaching Africa. At that time, a computer simulation estimated Apophis's hypothetical impact in countries, such as Colombia and Venezuela, could have resulted in more than 10 million casualties. Alternately, an impact in the Atlantic or Pacific oceans could produce a deadly tsunami over 240 metres (about 800 ft) in height, capable of destroying many coastal areas and cities. A series of later, more accurate observations of 99942 Apophis, combined with the recovery of previously unseen data, revised the odds of a collision in 2036 as being virtually nil, and effectively ruled it out. = International involvement = B612 Foundation members assisted the Association of Space Explorers (ASE) in helping obtain United Nations (UN) oversight of NEO tracking and deflection missions through the UN's Committee On the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UN COPUOS) along with COPUOS's Action Team 14 (AT-14) expert group. Several members of B612, also members of the ASE, worked with COPUOS since 2001 to establish international involvement for both impact disaster responses, and on deflection missions to prevent impact events. According to Foundation Chair Emeritus Rusty Schweickart in 2013, \\"No government in the world today has explicitly assigned the responsibility for planetary protection to any of its agencies\\". In October 2013, COPUOS's Scientific and Technical Subcommittee approved several measures, later approved by the UN General Assembly in December, to deal with terrestrial asteroid impacts, including the creation of an International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) plus two advisory groups: the Space Missions Planning Advisory Group (SMPAG), and the Impact Disaster Planning Advisory Group (IDPAG). The IAWN warning network will act as a clearinghouse for shared information on dangerous asteroids and for any future terrestrial impact events that are identified. The Space Missions Planning Advisory Group will coordinate joint studies of the technologies for deflection missions, and as well provide oversight of actual missions. This is due to deflection missions typically involving a progressive movement of an asteroid's predicted impact point across the surface of the Earth (and also across the territories of uninvolved countries) until the NEO is deflected either ahead of, or behind the planet at the point their orbits intersect. An initial framework of international cooperation at the UN is needed, said Schweickart, to guide the policymakers of its member nations on several important NEO-related aspects. However, as asserted by the Foundation, the new UN measures only constitute a starting point. To be effective they will need to be enhanced by further policies and resources implemented at both the national and supernational levels. At the time of the UN's policy adoption in New York City, Schweickart and four other ASE members, including B612 head Ed Lu and strategic advisers Dumitru Prunariu and Tom Jones participated in a public forum moderated by Neil deGrasse Tyson not far from the United Nations Headquarters. The panel urged the global community to adopt further important steps for planetary defense against NEO impacts. Their recommendations included: * UN delegates briefing their home countries' policymakers on the UN's newest roles; * having each country's government create detailed asteroid disaster response plans, assigning fiscal resources to deal with asteroid impacts, and delegating a lead agency to handle its disaster response in order to create clear lines of communication from the IAWN to the affected countries; * having their governments support the ASE's and B612's efforts to identify the estimated one million \\"city-killer\\" NEOs capable of impacting Earth, by deploying a space-based asteroid telescope, and * committing member states to launching an international test deflection mission within 10 years.  Sentinel Mission  Sentinel Space Telescope, planned to be built by Ball Aerospace The Sentinel Mission program was the cornerstone of the B612 Foundation's earlier efforts, with its preliminary design and system architecture level reviews planned for 2014, and its critical design review to be conducted in 2015. The infrared telescope would be launched atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, to be placed into a Venus-trailing Heliocentric orbit around the Sun. Orbiting between the Sun and Earth, the Sun's rays would always be behind the telescope's lens and thus never inhibit the space observatory's ability to detect asteroids or other near-Earth objects (NEOs). From the vantage of its inner-solar system orbit around the Sun, Sentinel would be able to \\"pick up objects that are currently difficult, if not impossible, to see in advance from Earth\\", such as occurred with the Chelyabinsk meteor of 2013 that went undetected until its explosion over Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia. The Sentinel Mission was planned to provide an accurate dynamic catalog of asteroids and other NEOs made available to scientists worldwide from the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center, the data collected would calculate the risk of impact events with our planet, allowing for asteroid deflection by the use of gravity tractors to divert their trajectories away from Earth. In order to communicate with the spacecraft while it is orbiting the Sun (at about the same distance as Venus), which can be at times as far as 270 million kilometres (170 million miles) from Earth, the B612 Foundation entered into a Space Act Agreement with NASA for the use of their deep space telecommunication network. = Design and operation = Sentinel was designed to perform continuous observation and analysis during its planned -year operational life, although B612 anticipates it may continue to function for up to 10 years. Using its telescope mirror with sensors built by Ball Aerospace (makers of the Hubble Space Telescope's instruments), its mission would be to catalog 90% of asteroids with diameters larger than . There were also plans to catalog smaller Solar System objects as well. The space observatory would measure by with a mass of and would orbit the Sun at a distance of approximately the same orbital distance as Venus, employing infrared astronomy to identify asteroids against the cold of outer space. Sentinel would scan in the 7- to 15-micron wavelength band across a 5.5 by 2-degree field of view. Its sensor array would consist of 16 detectors with coverage scanning \\"a 200-degree, full-angle field of regard\\". B612, working in partnership with Ball Aerospace, was constructing Sentinel's 51 cm aluminum mirror, designed for a large field of view with its infrared sensors cooled to using Ball's two-stage, closed-Stirling-cycle cryocooler. B612 aimed to produce its space telescope at a significantly lower cost than traditional space science programs by making use of space hardware systems previously developed for earlier programs, rather than designing a brand new observatory. Schweickart stated that about \\"80% of what we're dealing with in Sentinel is Kepler, 15% Spitzer, 5% new, higher-performance infrared sensors\\", thus concentrating its R&D; funds on the critical area of cryogenically-cooled image sensor technology, producing what it terms will be the most sensitive type of asteroid-finding telescope ever built. Data gathered by Sentinel would be provided through existing scientific data-sharing networks that include NASA and academic institutions such as the Minor Planet Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Given the satellite's telescopic accuracy, Sentinel's data may have proven valuable for other possible future missions, such as asteroid mining. = Mission funding = B612 was attempting to raise approximately $450M to fund the development, launch and operational costs of the telescope, about the cost of a complex freeway interchange, or approximately $100M less than a single Air Force Next-Generation Bomber. The $450 million cost estimate is composed of $250 million to create Sentinel, plus another $200 million for 10 years of operations. In explaining the Foundation's bypassing of possible governmental grants for such a mission, Dr. Lu stated their public fundraising appeal is being driven by \\"[t]he tragedy of the commons: When it's everybody's problem, it's nobody's problem\\", referring to a lack of ownership, priority and funding that governments have assigned to asteroid threats, also stating on a different occasion \\"We're the only ones taking it seriously.\\" According to another B612 board member, Rusty Schweickart, \\"The good news is, you can prevent it ‚Äî not just get ready for it! The bad news is, it's hard to get anybody to pay attention to it when there are potholes in the road.\\" After providing earlier Congressional testimony on the issue Schweickart was dismayed to hear from congressional staff members that, while U.S. lawmakers involved in the hearing understood the seriousness of the threat, they would likely not legislate funding for planetary defense as \\"making the deflection of asteroids a priority might backfire in [their] reelection campaigns\\". The Foundation intended to launch Sentinel in 2017‚Äì2018, with initiation of data transfer for on-Earth processing anticipated no later than 6 months afterwards. In the aftermath of the February 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor explosion‚Äîwhere an approximate asteroid entered the atmosphere undetected at about Mach 60, becoming a brilliant superbolide meteor before exploding over Chelyabinsk, Russia ‚Äîthe B612 foundation experienced a \\"surge of interest\\" in its project to detect asteroids, with a corresponding increase in funding donations. After providing Congressional testimony Dr. Lu noted that the many online videos recorded of the asteroid's explosion over Chelyabinsk made a significant impact on millions of viewers worldwide, saying \\"There's nothing like a hundred YouTube videos to do that.\\"  Staff  = Leadership = In 2014 eight key staff positions were designated, covering the offices of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Operating Officer (COO), Sentinel Program Architecture (SPA), Sentinel Mission Direction (SMD), Sentinel Program Management (SPM), Sentinel Mission Science (SMS) and the Sentinel Standing Review Team (SSRT), plus Public Relations.

Harold Reitsema, Sentinel Mission Director  Dr. Harold Reitsema, Sentinel Mission Director Dr. Harold James Reitsema (b. January 19, 1948, Kalamazoo, Michigan) is the foundation's Sentinel Mission Director and a U.S. astronomer. Reitsema was formerly Director of Science Mission Development at Ball Aerospace & Technologies, the B612 Foundation's prime contractor for designing and building its space telescope observatory. In his early career during the 1980s he was part of the teams that discovered new moons orbiting Neptune and Saturn through ground-based telescopic observations. Using a coronagraphic imaging system with one of the first charge-coupled devices available for astronomical use, they first observed Telesto in April 1980, just two months after being one of the first groups to observe Janus, also a moon of Saturn. Reitsema, as part of a different team of astronomers, observed Larissa in May 1981, by watching the occultation of a star by the Neptune system. Reitsema is also responsible for several advances in the use of false-color techniques applied to astronomical images. Reitsema was a member of the Halley Multicolour Camera team on the European Space Agency Giotto spacecraft that took close-up images of Comet Halley in 1986. He has been involved in many of NASA's space science missions including the Spitzer Space Telescope, Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite, the New Horizons mission to Pluto and the Kepler Space Observatory project searching for Earth-like planets orbiting distant stars similar to the Sun. Reitsema participated in the ground-based observations of Deep Impact mission in 2005, observing the impact of the spacecraft on the Tempel 1 comet using the telescopes of the Sierra de San Pedro M√°rtir Observatory in Mexico, along with colleagues from the University of Maryland and the Mexican National Astronomical Observatory. Reitsema retired from Ball Aerospace in 2008 and remains a consultant to NASA and the aerospace industry in mission design and Near-Earth Objects. His education includes his B.A. in physics from Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1972 and a Ph.D. in astronomy from New Mexico State University in 1977.

He is the namesource for Asteroid 17031 Piethut honoring his work in planetary dynamics and for his co-founding of B612.  Dumitru Prunariu, strategic adviser  UN COPUOS Dr. Dumitru-Dorin Prunariu (, b. 27 September 1952) is a retired Romanian cosmonaut and a strategic advisor to the B612 Foundation. In 1981 he flew an eight-day mission to the Soviet Salyut 6 space station where he and his crewmates completed experiments in astrophysics, space radiation, space technology, and space medicine. He received the Hero of the Socialist Republic of Romania, the Hero of the Soviet Union, the \\"Hermann Oberth Gold Medal\\", the \\"Golden Star Medal\\" and the Order of Lenin. Prunariu is a member of the International Academy of Astronautics, the Romanian National COSPAR Committee, and the Association of Space Explorers (ASE). In 1993, until 2004, he was the permanent representative of the ASE at the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UN COPUOS) and has represented Romania at COPUOS sessions since 1992. He also became the vice-president of the International Institute for Risk, Security and Communication Management (EURISC), and from 1998 to 2004 the president of the Romanian Space Agency. In 2000 he was appointed Associate Professor on Geopolitics within the Faculty of International Business and Economics, Academy of Economic Studies in Bucharest and in 2004 he was elected COPUOS's Chairman of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee. He was then elected as COPUOS's top level chairman, serving from 2010 to 2012, and also elected as the president of the ASE with a three-year mandate. Prunariu has co-authored several books on space flight and both presented and published numerous scientific papers. His education includes a degree in aerospace engineering in 1976 from the Politehnica University of Bucharest. His Ph.D. thesis led to improvements in the field of space flight dynamics.  Deflection methods  A number of methods have been devised to 'deflect' an asteroid or other NEO away from an Earth-impacting trajectory, so that it can entirely avoid entering the Earth's atmosphere. Given sufficient advance lead time, a change to the body's velocity of as little as one centimetre per second will allow it to avoid hitting the Earth. Proposed and experimental deflection methods include ion beam shepherds, focused solar energy and the use of mass drivers or solar sails. Initiating a nuclear explosive device above, on, or slightly beneath, the surface of a threatening NEO is a potential deflection option, with the optimal detonation height dependent upon the NEO's composition and size. In the case of a threatening \\"rubble pile\\", the stand off, or detonation height above the surface configuration has been put forth as a means to prevent the potential fracturing of the rubble pile. However, given sufficient advance warning of an asteroid's impact, most scientists avoid endorsing explosive deflection due to the number of potential issues involved. Other methods that can accomplish NEO deflections include: = Gravity tractor = An alternative to an explosive deflection is to move a dangerous asteroid slowly and consistently over time. The effect of a tiny constant thrust can accumulate to deviate an object sufficiently from its predicted course. In 2005 Drs. Ed Lu and Stanley G. Love proposed using a large, heavy unmanned spacecraft hovering over an asteroid to gravitationally pull the latter into a non-threatening orbit. The method will function due to the spacecraft's and asteroid's mutually gravitational attraction. When the spacecraft counters the gravitational attraction towards the asteroid by the use of, for example, an ion thruster engine, the net effect is that the asteroid is accelerated, or moved, towards the spacecraft and thus slowly deflected from the orbital path that will lead it to a collision with Earth. While slow, this method has the advantage of working irrespective of an asteroid's composition. It would even be effective on a comet, loose rubble pile, or an object spinning at a high rate. However, a gravity tractor would likely have to spend several years stationed beside and tugging on the body to be effective. The Sentinel Space Telescope's mission is designed to provide the required advance lead time. According to Rusty Schweickart, the gravitational tractor method also has a controversial aspect because during the process of changing an asteroid's trajectory, the point on Earth where it would most likely hit would slowly be shifted temporarily across the face of the planet. It means the threat for the entire planet might be minimized at a temporary cost of some specific states' security. Schweickart recognizes that choosing the manner and direction the asteroid should be \\"dragged\\" may be a difficult international decision, and one that should be made through the United Nations. An early NASA analysis of deflection alternatives in 2007, stated: \\"'Slow push' mitigation techniques are the most expensive, have the lowest level of technical readiness, and their ability to both travel to and divert a threatening NEO would be limited unless mission durations of many years to decades are possible.\\" But a year later in 2008 the B612 Foundation released a technical evaluation of the gravity tractor concept, produced on contract to NASA. Their report confirmed that a transponder-equipped tractor \\"with a simple and robust spacecraft design\\" can provide the needed towing service for a 140-meters-diameter equivalent, Hayabusa-shaped asteroid or other NEO. = Kinetic impact = An artist's rendering of NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft next to Comet Tempel 1 Deep Impact being crashed into Comet Tempel 1 in July 2005 (photographed from a companion spacecraft), an example of a technique that can alter a NEO's trajectory. :See also: Deep Impact, Lightweight Exo-Atmospheric Projectile and AIDA. When the asteroid is still far from Earth, a means of deflecting the asteroid is to directly alter its momentum by colliding a spacecraft with the asteroid. The further away from the Earth, the smaller the required impact force becomes. Conversely, the closer a dangerous near-Earth Object (NEO) is to Earth at the time of its discovery, the greater the force that is required to make it deviate from its collision trajectory with the Earth. Closer to Earth, the impact of a massive spacecraft is a possible solution to a pending NEO impact. In 2005, in the wake of the successful U.S. mission that crashed its Deep Impact probe into Comet Tempel 1, China announced its plan for a more advanced version: the landing of a spacecraft probe on a small NEO in order to push it off course. In the 2000s the European Space Agency (ESA) began studying the design of a space mission named Don Quijote, which, if flown, would have been the first intentional asteroid deflection mission ever designed. ESA's Advanced Concepts Team also demonstrated theoretically that a deflection of 99942 Apophis could be achieved by sending a spacecraft weighing less than a tonne to impact against the asteroid. ESA had originally identified two NEOs as possible targets for its Quijote mission: and (10302) 1989 ML. Neither asteroid represents a threat to Earth. In a subsequent study, two different possibilities were selected: the Amor asteroid 2003 SM84 and 99942 Apophis; the latter is of particular significance to Earth as it will make a close approach in 2029 and 2036. In 2005, ESA announced at the 44th annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference that its mission would be combined into a joint ESA-NASA Asteroid Impact & Deflection Assessment (AIDA) mission, proposed for 2019‚Äì2022. The target selected for AIDA will be a binary asteroid, so that the deflection effect could also be observed from Earth by timing the rotation period of the binary pair. AIDA's new target, a component of binary asteroid 65803 Didymos, will be impacted at a velocity of 22,530 km/h (14,000 mph) A NASA analysis of deflection alternatives, conducted in 2007, stated: \\"Non-nuclear kinetic impactors are the most mature approach and could be used in some deflection/mitigation scenarios, especially for NEOs that consist of a single small, solid body.\\"  Funding status  The B612 Foundation is a California 501(c)(3) non-profit, private foundation. Financial contributions to the B612 Foundation are tax-exempt in the United States. Its principal offices are in Mountain View, California; they were previously located in Tiburon, California. Fund raising has not gone well for B612 as of June 2015. With an overall goal to raise for the project, the foundation raised only approximately in 2012 and in 2013.  Foundation name  The B612 Foundation is named in tribute to the home asteroid of the eponymous hero of Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry's best-selling philosophical fable of Le Petit Prince (The Little Prince). In aviation's early pioneer years of the 1920s, Saint- Exup√©ry made an emergency landing on top of an African mesa covered with crushed white limestone seashells. Walking around in the moonlight he kicked a black rock and soon deduced it was a meteorite that had fallen from space. That experience later contributed, in 1943, to his literary creation of Asteroid B-612 in his philosophical fable of a little prince fallen to Earth, with the home planetoid's name having been adapted from one of the mail planes Saint-Exup√©ry once flew, bearing the registration marking A-612. Also inspired by the story is an asteroid discovered in 1993, though not identified as posing any threat to Earth, named 46610 B√©sixdouze (the numerical part of its designation represented in hexadecimal as 'B612', while the textual part is French for \\"B six twelve\\"). As well, a small asteroid moon, Petit-Prince, discovered in 1998 is named in part after The Little Prince.

The story is set over the years 1588‚Äì1593 and concerns a retired Cornish seafaring gentleman, Sir Oliver Tressilian, who is villainously betrayed by a jealous half-brother. After being forced to serve as a slave on a galley, Sir Oliver is liberated by Barbary pirates. He joins the pirates, gaining the name \\"Sakr- el-Bahr\\" (the hawk of the sea), and swears vengeance against his brother. __TOC__ Plot summary Sir Oliver Tressilian lives at the estate of Penarrow with his brother, Lionel. Oliver is betrothed to Rosamund Godolphin, whose hot-headed brother, Peter, detests the Tressilians due to an old feud between their fathers. Peter and Rosamund's guardian, Sir John Killigrew, also has little love for the Tressilians. Peter's manipulations drive Oliver into a duel with Sir John. The scheme backfires: Sir John is seriously wounded, further stoking Peter's hatred. Peter attempts to bait Oliver into a violent confrontation, but Oliver is mindful of Rosamund's warning never to meet her brother in an affair of honor. One evening, Lionel returns home, bloodied and exhausted. He has killed Peter in a duel, but there were no witnesses. Oliver is widely believed to be Peter's killer, and Lionel does nothing to disprove the accusations. To avoid repercussions for Peter's death, Lionel has Oliver kidnapped and sold into slavery to ensure that he never reveals the truth. En route to the New World, the slave ship is boarded by the Spanish, and her crew are added to the slaves. For six months Oliver toils at the oars of a Spanish galley. He befriends a Moorish slave, Yusuf-ben-Moktar. Oliver, Yusuf and the other slaves are freed when the galley is boarded by Muslim corsairs. They offer to fight for the Muslims. Oliver's fighting skills and the testimony of Yusuf, the nephew of the Basha of Algiers, grants Oliver special privileges in Muslim society. He becomes a corsair known as Sakr-el-Bahr, \\"the Hawk of the Sea\\". In this new role, Oliver rescues English slaves by purchasing them himself and releasing them in Italy. Oliver captures a Spanish vessel and discovers his one-time kidnapper, Jasper Leigh, as a slave at the oars. He gives Jasper the opportunity to convert to Islam and join his corsairs. With Jasper's navigational skills, Sakr-el-Bahr sets sail for England to take revenge on Lionel. Lionel has taken possession of Penarrow. He is now betrothed to Rosamund, who believes that Oliver murdered her brother. Sakr-el- Bahr carries them off to Algiers to be sold as slaves. The Basha sees Rosamund in the market and becomes infatuated with her, planning to buy her for himself. However, he does not have enough ready cash to meet the high bid, and Sakr-el-Bahr wins her instead. The Basha threatens to take her by force, but Sakr-el-Bahr marries her, foiling the Basha's efforts. He also buys Lionel and tricks him into revealing to Rosamund the truth about Peter's death. Rosamund is horrified at Lionel's lies and treachery, calls him a coward, and dismisses him from her, before Sakr-el-Bahr condemns him to serve as a rower in his own galley. Sir Oliver realizes how strong his guilt must have appeared to Rosamund, and loses his hatred for her. Sakr-el-Bahr's refusal to sell Rosamund to the Basha infuriates the Basha, and the Basha threatens to have her carried off in spite of their hasty marriage. Seeing the danger into which he has brought Rosamund by carrying her to Algiers, Oliver regrets having abducted her. He begins to realize that he still loves her, and vows to return her safely to Europe with her honor intact, at the cost of his life, if necessary. To this end, he smuggles her aboard his galley, but is dismayed to find that the Basha, goaded into mistrust of Sakr-el-Bahr by his son and wife, and still consumed with desire for Rosamund, has resolved to accompany him on his next mission: an attempt to capture a Spanish treasure ship rumored to be passing from Spain to Italy. Less than a day into the voyage, Rosamund's hiding place on the galley is discovered by the Basha's scheming son, Marzak. The Basha again attempts to take her by force, but Sakr-el-Bahr threatens mutiny, and it is clear that the crew would be equally divided between Sakr- el-Bahr and the Basha. Neither leader is willing to risk his goals on the hazard of an open conflict, and an uneasy stalemate results as the galley reaches its ambuscade and waits for the Spanish treasure ship to pass. Sir Oliver's protection of her in the face of what she believes to be certain death begins to reawaken Rosamund's respect and trust of him. Unexpectedly, the first ship they sight is an English ship bearing a pennant which Oliver and Rosamund recognize as belonging to Sir John Killegrew‚ÄîSir John has sworn an oath to rescue Lionel and Rosamund, and to hang Sakr-el-Bahr. Not realizing the proximity of the corsair, Sir John's ship comes to anchor just round the point from the hidden galley. Sir Oliver sees his chance to return Rosamund to safety, and at dusk contrives to have Lionel thrown overboard, ostensibly for insubordination, but in reality giving him secret instructions to swim round the point in the dark with a message for Sir John. Lionel reaches Sir John, and the English attempt to attack the corsairs, but the wind is very light and the Moorish galley, using her oars, is able to travel much faster than the English sailing ship. Oliver sees that they will surely escape the English ship, and hijacks command of the galley by threatening to detonate the open powder magazine with his torch. He compels the galley to allow the English ship to come alongside. The English crew boards the galley, and in an abortive fight, Lionel, who was first to board the galley, receives a pike thrust through the body from one of the Moors. Sakr-el-Bahr compels both sides to cease fighting, and negotiates a truce‚Äîhe will surrender himself to Sir John, on the condition that the Moors will allow Rosamund to leave with the English, and that the English will allow the Moors to leave without further molesting them. The Basha, caught in a trap, outgunned, and furious at Sakr-el-Bahr's mutinies, is happy to give him to the English, deeming they will hang him. Sir John is content to let the Basha depart as long as Rosamund and Sir Oliver are in his custody, and the truce is agreed upon. The Basha's galley departs; Sakr-el-Bahr is flung into the hold, and told to prepare himself for execution. Rosamund, seeing Sir Oliver about to sacrifice his life to ensure her safety, realizes that she still loves him. In the cabin of the English ship, Sir John is told that Lionel is mortally wounded and will likely never recover consciousness. Sir John; Lord Henry Goade, Queen's Lieutenant of Cornwall; and the other officers of the ship form a tribunal to pass judgment on Sir Oliver before hanging him. To their surprise and dismay, Rosamund defends him fiercely, telling them the true story of what happened. They at first believe her to be mad, and then later to be deliberately lying to cover up the man who they say has bewitched her, until word comes that Lionel has recovered consciousness and is asking for his brother. Lionel makes a full confession in the presence of the tribunal, and asks Sir Oliver to forgive him. Sir Oliver does, and Lionel passes away in his brother's arms as Sir Oliver mourns his death and remembers the happy years they had spent together. Faced with confirmation of all Rosamund has told them, the tribunal is forced to admit they have no ground for hanging Sir Oliver, and Lord Henry, as the Queen's Lieutenant, personally guarantees that he will ensure Sir Oliver is cleared of all charges when they arrive in England. The book closes with Sir Oliver and Rosamund on the deck of the ship, embracing as they look forward to a happy future. Film adaptations  *Frank Lloyd directed and produced The Sea Hawk (1924), a silent film adaptation of the novel, which was fairly faithful to Sabatini's original plot. *The well-known film The Sea Hawk (1940), starring Errol Flynn, was originally planned as an adaptation of the novel, but an entirely different story was substituted under the same title. Still a swashbuckling tale, however, the film used some footage taken directly from the 1924 adaptation. The Sea Hawk was published as an Armed Services Edition in 1944.

Pal √ãngj√´lli is reported to have been a friend, co-worker and close counselor of Skanderbeg. As his envoy, he frequently traveled abroad, seeking for aid in the war against the Ottoman Empire. Pal is the Northern Albanian version of Paul, and √ãngj√´lli is the Albanian form of angel. √ãngj√´lli managed to convince Lek√´ Dukagjini to leave Ottomans and later reconcile with Skanderbeg, and also to convince Skanderbeg to violate an armistice signed with the Ottomans. The baptism formula document The sentence was the baptismal formula in the Gheg Albanian (): Un'te paghesont' pr'emenit t'Atit e t'Birit e t'Spertit Senit. () and in the Tosk-based standard: ). The formula was found in a pastoral letter written in Latin by √ãngj√´lli after his visit to the Church of Holy Trinity in Mat. The letter is dated 8 November 1462. The formula was meant to be used by Albanian priests to render the ritual understandable for people ignorant of Latin. Probably it was meant also to be used by Albanian people in the countryside, unable to take their children to be baptized to a church. The formula was approved by a synod in Mat, Albania, in 1462. The document containing the baptismal formula is held in the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, Florence, Italy. It was discovered in 1915 by the Romanian scholar Nicolae Iorga.

S. Eliot's Prufrock and Other Observations, published in 1917, a collection of twelve poems including \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" referenced in the title A poetry collection is often a compilation of several poems by one poet to be published in a single volume or chapbook. A collection can include any number of poems, ranging from a few (e.g. the four long poems in T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets) to several hundred poems (as is often seen in collections of haiku). Typically the poems included in single volume of poetry, or a cycle of poems, are linked by their style or thematic material. Most poets publish several volumes of poetry through the course their life while other poets publish one (e.g. Walt Whitman's lifelong expansion of Leaves of Grass). The notion of a \\"collection\\" differs in definition from volumes of a poet's \\"collected poems\\", \\"selected poems\\" or from a poetry anthology. Typically, a volume entitled \\"Collected Poems\\" is a compilation by a poet or an editor of a poet's work that is often both published and previously unpublished, drawn over a set span of years of the poet's work, or the entire poet's life, that represents a more complete or definitive edition of the poet's work.Mills, Billy. \\"Do collected poems provide a complete account of an author? As well as providing an unwelcome memento mori, they can obscure as much as they reveal about a poet's work\\" from The Guardian (20 July 2009). Retrieved 21 May 2013. Comparatively, a volume titled \\"selected poems\\" often includes a small but not definitive selection of poems by a poet or editor drawn from several of the poet's collections.Kilgore-Caradec, Jennifer, and Aji, H√©l√®ne. Selected Poems From Modernism to Now. (Newcastle-upon-Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012). This work was the result of a March 2008 colloquium at Universit√© de Caen .

It states that commercial video recordings offered for sale or for hire within the UK must carry a classification that has been agreed upon by an authority designated by the Home Office. The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), which had been instrumental in the certification of motion pictures since 1912, was designated as the classifying authority in 1985. Works are classified by the BBFC under an age- rated system (see motion picture rating systems); it is an offence under the Act to supply video works to individuals who are (or appear to be) under the age of the classification designated. Works that are refused classification cannot, under the Act, be legally sold or supplied to anyone of any age unless it is educational, or to do with a sport, religion or music and does not depict violence, sex or incite a criminal offence. The BBFC may also require cuts to be made, either to receive a certain age rating, or to be allowed a classification at all. Leadup The act was a legislative reaction to a moral panic concerning \\"video nasties\\" that was sparked by tabloid newspapers in Britain during 1982 and 1983. History Sport, music, religious, and educational works are exempt from classification under the Act. Exemption may be forfeited if the work depicts excessive human sexual activity or acts of force or restraint associated with such activity, mutilation or torture of humans or animals, human genital organs or urinary or excretory functions, or techniques likely to be useful in the perpetration of criminal acts or illicit activity. The Act was accompanied by the Video Recordings (Labelling) Act 1985, which set out regulations governing the display of certificates awarded by the BBFC on published recordings. The act was amended in the Video Recordings Act 1993 but underwent no significant changes. It was amended again in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 to deal with the growing issue of \\"video violence\\". In addition, the amendment extended the definition of a video recording to any device capable of storing electronic data, which invariably includes works available on DVD as well as CD and CD-ROM, although the amendment exempts video games (except if they depict criminal activity which is likely to any significant extent to stimulate or encourage the commission of offences). The current labelling regulations are The Video Recordings (Labelling) Regulations 2012. In August 2009 it was discovered that the Act was unenforceable as the European Commission was not notified about it, as required by Directive 83/189 (see now Directive 98/34). Directive 83/189 had to be implemented by 31 March 1984 (12 months after its notification to the Member States). Until this situation was rectified, it was legal to sell and supply unclassified videos and computer games, although many retailers had agreed to observe the regulations voluntarily. Then pending prosecutions under the Act were abandoned, but the government has claimed that past convictions cannot be challenged. In December 2009 the government introduced new legislation, the Video Recordings Act 2010,https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldbills/022/10022.i-i.html which repealed and immediately revived the Video Recordings Act 1984, after the required notification was provided to the European Commission in October 2009. This legislation, which was enacted under the \\"fast-track\\" procedure (and therefore was expedited through Parliament), made the 1984 Act enforceable once again, as well as allowing it to be amended by the Digital Economy Act 2010. In December 2014 streaming and on demand services were brought under the remit of this act via the Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014.

If f is a function from real numbers to real numbers, then f is nowhere continuous if for each point x there is an such that for each we can find a point y such that and . Therefore, no matter how close we get to any fixed point, there are even closer points at which the function takes not- nearby values. More general definitions of this kind of function can be obtained, by replacing the absolute value by the distance function in a metric space, or by using the definition of continuity in a topological space. Dirichlet function One example of such a function is the indicator function of the rational numbers, also known as the Dirichlet function. This function is denoted as IQ or 1Q and has domain and codomain both equal to the real numbers. IQ(x) equals 1 if x is a rational number and 0 if x is not rational. More generally, if E is any subset of a topological space X such that both E and the complement of E are dense in X, then the real-valued function which takes the value 1 on E and 0 on the complement of E will be nowhere continuous. Functions of this type were originally investigated by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet. Hyperreal characterisation A real function f is nowhere continuous if its natural hyperreal extension has the property that every x is infinitely close to a y such that the difference is appreciable (i.e., not infinitesimal). See also * Blumberg theoremeven if a real function f : ‚Ñù ‚Üí ‚Ñù is nowhere continuous, there is a dense subset D of ‚Ñù such that the restriction of f to D is continuous. * Thomae's function (also known as the popcorn function)a function that is continuous at all irrational numbers and discontinuous at all rational numbers. * Weierstrass functiona function continuous everywhere (inside its domain) and differentiable nowhere.

Released on June 26, 2003 to much critical acclaim, it spawned three expansions through 2005. The game was completely overhauled in the last expansion, which frustrated many longtime subscribers. Star Wars Galaxies continued operation for six more years. The servers shut down on December 15, 2011, just 5 days prior to the release of Star Wars: The Old Republic. Notwithstanding the game's closure, there are several private emulator projects in various stages of development that intend to allow users to experience Star Wars Galaxies in different incarnations of the game's existence. Development The game was first announced in 2000, when LucasArts Entertainment began a partnership with EverQuest creators Verant Interactive Inc. and Sony Online Entertainment to create the first massively multiplayer Star Wars online role-playing game. The announcement included an expected release date of 2001 and that the game would take place during the original trilogy era. On 17 May 2001, even before the game went into public beta testing, the first expansion's development was announced. The yet unnamed add-on, which was expected to be available six months after the initial product release, would be a space simulation and enable players to own and fly starships which would allow interplanetary travel and space combat. The release date of the initial product, the ground-based component, was updated to the second half of 2002. The staggered release schedule of the space component of the Star Wars Galaxies series was said to benefit players because they would have time to establish their characters and explore different elements of the core game before adding the space layer. Traveling between planets would be accomplished through the use of public shuttles, which would ferry characters from world to world. A new official site was also released on the same day that put more of an emphasis behind the community of the game. It included new screen shots, movies, an updated FAQ, concept art, development team member's profiles, features about the game, and a new forum. The site reached 100,001 users by December 2001. Throughout the next year after the release of the new site, new content would be revealed. This content included information on species and locations, new images and movies of different game elements, and 360 degree QuickTime VR panoramas of different locations. The closed beta test began in July 2002. SOE would share more information on the game as the beta moved forward. This would include more screen shots, information on match making services, the fact that players would be permitted only one character per server, and skill trees and how the skill-based system would function. LucasArts also said in 2002 that both the Xbox and PlayStation 2 would get a version of the game, however both versions were cancelled. The game was originally to be released on April 15, 2003. They also announced on December 20, 2002, that the ground-based component of Star Wars Galaxies would be called An Empire Divided and that the game's online community had grown to over 400,000 users since its inception in November 2000. At the time, this represented one of the largest ever fan communities amassed for any game prior to retail availability. An Empire Divided would later be delayed to June 26, 2003. Release and expansions =An Empire Divided= Star Wars Galaxies before Jump to Lightspeed The base game, titled Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, was released on 26 June 2003 in the US and on 7 November 2003 in Europe. A localized version for the Japanese market was published by EA Japan on 23 December 2004. Japanese acceptance of the game was low, and in November 2005 the servers were shut down and existing accounts migrated to US servers. At the time of its initial release, the game was very different from how it ended up. Vehicles and creature mounts were not yet implemented. While player housing was available at the time of launch, the ability to incorporate groups of houses into cities didn't come until November 2003. Each character and creature possessed three \\"pools\\" (called Health, Action, and Mind; or \\"HAM\\") that represented his or her physical and mental reserves. Most attacks specifically targeted one of these three pools and any action the character took also depleted one or more of the pools. When any one of those pools was fully depleted, the character would fall unconscious. Combat, then, required the player to carefully manage his or her actions to avoid depleting a pool. Character progression was vastly different at release as well. Characters started out in one of six basic professions (Medic, Brawler, Marksman, Scout, Entertainer, or Artisan) and could pick up any of the other five at any time after character creation. Each profession consisted of a tree-like structure of skills, with a single Novice level, four independent branches of four levels each, and a Master level which required completion of all four branches. Characters purchased these skills with experience points gained through a related activity. For example, an Entertainer could purchase skills to get better at playing music, but only with Musician experience points. Dancing experience points were entirely separate and could only be used to purchase dancing skills. In addition to the basic professions, characters could specialize into advanced professions such as Bounty Hunter, Creature Handler, Ranger, Doctor, and Musician. There were a total of 24 advanced professions, although there was no way for characters to obtain all of them at once. Each advanced profession had certain skill requirements from the base professions that had to be met, some more restrictive than others. Jedi were not available as a starting profession, or even as an advanced profession. The developers stated only that certain in- game actions would open up a Force-sensitive character slot. The actions required were left for players to discover. It eventually turned out that characters had to achieve Master level in random professions. At first the player had to complete four master level classes which were randomly chosen and unknown to the player. The developers then introduced Holocrons which would inform the player of the first, then after completion second master class required. At various times the number of master levels needed ranged from four to seven and the number revealed by holocrons varied from two to four. Because of the difficulty in obtaining a force sensitive (Jedi) character, the profession had many advantages in combat, often capable of taking on very powerful enemies or defeating entire groups of other non-Jedi characters in Player vs. Player combat. The first Force-sensitive character slot was unlocked on 7 November 2003. =Jump to Lightspeed= This first expansion, Jump to Lightspeed, was released on 27 October 2004. Two new races were added: Sullustan and Ithorian. The expansion added space combat. Characters choose one of three factions in the new Pilot sub-profession: Rebel, Imperial, or Freelance. The playable sectors include the space surrounding the 10 planets of the game as well as Ord Mantell, Kessel and \\"Deep Space.\\" Combat is real-time and twitch-oriented like a first-person shooter and can be played with a joystick at the player's option. A new Artisan profession, Shipwright (now subsumed into the Trader profession as part of the Structures specialty), was also introduced. This profession created ships, shields, armor, weapons, etc. for players. They also have the ability to take looted components from space and reverse engineer them into better components. Players can construct their own ships with a base chassis, adding their own reactors, weapons, armor, shields, aesthetics and more, all of which visually change the starship's appearance. In many ways, this is the spiritual successor to the hit LucasArt's space combat flight simulation game Star Wars: X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter, as the theme, interface and objectives are quite similar. =Rage of the Wookiees= The second expansion, Episode III Rage of the Wookiees, was announced on 9 March 2005 and released on 5 May 2005. It added the Wookiee planet of Kashyyyk and its corresponding space sector. Kashyyyk is different from the previous 10 planets: rather than being 16 square kilometers of openly navigable area, it is divided into a small central area with several instanced \\"dungeon\\" areas. A new space zone was also added. Other content added in this expansion included the ability to add cybernetic limbs to a player character and quests for two new creature mounts and three new starships. A substantial portion of the content for this expansion was adapted from the film Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith which was released to theaters in the U.S. on May 19, two weeks after the expansion release. Other features included new starfighters, resource mining in space, and cybernetic limbs for player characters. The cybernetic limbs, however, were not due to the loss of an arm in combat. The player had to obtain the arm and then surgically attach it. Customers who purchased the expansion also received a limited-edition Varactyl pet as a player mount. Rage of the Wookiees expansion also added a few quests, one allowed the player to obtain a pet Bolotaur after going through several tasks. The Bolotaur is similar to the Veractyl but larger and brown. Gameplay mechanics for combat and armor/weapon systems received a major alteration on April 27, 2005, when SOE released the Combat Upgrade that replaced a system that allowed players with combat professions to stack defensive abilities from various skill sets, while also fixing an exploit that allowed players to have their character attack freshly spawning non-player characters (NPC) and creatures while away from their computers in order to gain combat skill experience. =Trials of Obi-Wan= The third expansion, Star Wars Galaxies: Trials of Obi-Wan, was announced on 19 August 2005 and released on 1 November 2005. This expansion added the ground planet of Mustafar to the game. No new space sector was added with this expansion. Like the previous expansion, much of the content is related to Revenge of the Sith, which was released to DVD on the same day as the expansion was released. Additional content, including the presence of the droid HK-47, is based on the Knights of the Old Republic games. One week after this release the entire character development process was changed in the New Game Enhancements (NGE). Major changes included the reduction and simplification of professions, simplification of gameplay mechanics, and Jedi becoming a starting profession. This led to a number of players demanding their money back for the expansion. After a week or two of protests Sony offered refunds to anyone who asked for it. Many player towns became ghost towns due to the reaction of long term players who decided to depart en masse. Later history =Trading Card Game= On 27 August 2008, following the success of SOE's Legends of Norrath, LucasArts and SOE released Champions of the Force, an online trading card game based on Star Wars Galaxies. In the game, players could collect, battle, and trade with each other as well as buy new cards with money and get new in-game items from the cards to use; such as podracers and house paintings. Over one hundred cards were created for players to find and play against others with new artwork featured on each card. =Server closures= On 16 September 2009, SOE informed all current and past account holders of the forthcoming closure of 12 servers (galaxies): Corbantis, Europe-Infinity, Intrepid, Kauri, Kettemoor, Lowca, Naritus, Scylla, Tarquinas, Tempest, Valcyn and Wanderhome. Character creation on these servers was disabled on September 15, 2009, with the final closure of the servers on October 15, 2009. Players with characters on the affected servers were offered free character transfer to one of the 13 remaining servers. =Hacking incident= On May 3, 2011, SOE issued a press release stating that all SOE have been isolated from the Internet, due to massive and widespread security infiltrations of various games, servers, databases. Security teams (and the FBI) were called in and at that time no information was available regarding when the services would be restored. Initial reports indicated personal data of 20-30 million customers has potentially been compromised, none within the USA. The information compromised was old information including addresses and CC information from 2007. All SOE webpages were re-directed temporarily to a customer announcement and a press release page. On 14 May 2011, SOE declared everything safe and reopened all servers. SOE offered a free 30-day membership for gamers with memberships and a 1:1 ratio of days lost. Once opened they have given every account 45 free days as well as a minor object of decoration as a \\"perk\\" for waiting out the cause. On May 17, 2011, SOE released Hotfix 19.17 which introduced the new feature of bounty- hunting in space. This allows players to place a bounty on players of the opposite faction who have recently destroyed their ship in space combat. This allowed bounty hunters to pick these targets up as missions and pursue them in space for the monetary reward (up to 1 million credits) the player has placed on the target. =Closure= On 24 June 2011, SOE and LucasArts announced that they had mutually agreed to shut down Star Wars Galaxies on 15 December 2011. According to the SOE announcement, both LucasArts and SOE came to the agreement that \\"If you are an active subscriber in good standing as of September 15, 2011, then you can play for free for the final months. Players wishing to play through the end of the game and participate in the galaxy- ending event planned for the last week of live service in December will need to re-activate or join the game on or before September 15th. No new or reactivated accounts will be accepted after September 15, 2011.\\" On December 15, 2011, at 9:01 PM Pacific time, the servers of Star Wars Galaxies shut down, disconnecting those still playing and not allowing any entry back to the game. The final five hours were broadcast in a live stream by Giant Bomb, with Kotaku reporting events as they happened on the Giant Bomb stream, including a final player versus player event between the Galactic Empire and The Rebels, as well as an appearance from the Force Ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi as depicted in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. = Emulation = In 2004, the SWGEmu project was founded with the intention of re-creating the Pre-Combat Upgrade version of Star Wars Galaxies from scratch through emulation by reverse engineering the official game client and writing a server that communications with it in the same way the original SOE servers did. The goal of SWGEmu is to emulate the game to its entirety as it was on the live servers through patch 14.1. In 2020, the SWGEmu project announced it was near completion (colloquially referred to as version 1.0) and that many of the existing developers who had invested significant time over the past ten or more years would be taking a back seat role moving forward and also announced that the Jump to Lightspeed expansion may no longer be included in version 1.0 due to the complexities of implementing the system. SWGEmu is an open source project distributed under the Affero General Public License. The server, known as Core3, has been open source since before 2010, allowing for volunteers to easily contribute to its development. In 2019, SWGEmu also open sourced its engine, known as Engine3. Because SWGEmu is open source, any members are able to easily launch their own server for their own community. There are several community-ran servers which develop content beyond the 14.1 publish goal of SWGEmu, such as An Empire in Flames, Sunrunner II, SWG Awakening Tarkin's Revenge and Sentinel's Republic. In 2011, after Sony Online Entertainment announced the intention of shutting down Star Wars Galaxies, Project SWG was founded under the same sentiment as SWGEmu to emulate the New Game Enhancements version of Star Wars Galaxies. Project SWG has not been as objectively successful as SWGEmu and has undergone multiple refactors of their code since conception. Their current server, Holocore, is still under development by a small team and is several years away from completion. Other interested developers are also using Project SWG's framework to develop a Combat Upgrade version of the game. Project SWG's once thriving community has dwindled due to the leak of the official source code and launch of game servers running the leaked code. Both SWGEmu and Project SWG are regarded as the primary emulation projects for Star Wars Galaxies with other communities utilizing their source code to run their own server, sometimes contributing specific code to create their own content or by using shared content from resources such as ModTheGalaxy, a game modification distribution forum. All emulation projects are free-to-play and donation-supported to respect the sensitivities around the legality of emulation to begin with. Some player-made tools created while Star Wars Galaxies was live, such as SWGCraft and GalaxyHarvester, are still up and running with connections to most hosted servers today. = Source Code Leak = In 2013, a former Sony Online Entertainment employee leaked a copy of the 2010 production release source code for the Star Wars Galaxies client, server, 3rd party libraries and development tools to a few former players involved with the \\"New Game Enhancements\\" Star Wars Galaxies emulator Project SWG. The code was later leaked beyond its intended recipients and made available online. Setting The game events were originally set following the destruction of the Death Star in Episode IV: A New Hope, but before the beginning of The Empire Strikes Back. Even though the battle of Hoth has been included this does not change the timeline. Some parts of the game include past \\"missions\\" to before the destruction of the Death Star. The game launched with 10 planets: Tatooine, Naboo, Corellia, Talus, Rori, Dantooine, Lok, Yavin 4, the forest moon of Endor, and Dathomir. In the second expansion, Rage of the Wookiees, the Wookiee home planet Kashyyyk was added. In the third expansion, Trials of Obi- Wan, the planet Mustafar was added. Each of the original 10 planets are represented by approximately 225 square kilometers (15 km x 15 km maps) of game space. In contrast, the expansion planets of Kashyyyk and Mustafar are smaller, constructed differently (e.g. instances) and in some cases imposed different rules than the original, such as terrain that is not traversable (i.e. mountains or hills that cannot be climbed over).Star Wars - Star Wars News about the saga In addition to the 12 planets, there are 12 space zones, each encompassing approximately 3400 cubic kilometers (15 km cubes) of fully navigable space. Nine of them are associated with one or more of the playable planets: Tattoo (Tatooine), Naboo (Naboo and Rori), Corellia (Corellia and Talus), Dantooine, Karthakk (Lok), Yavin, Endor, Dathomir, and Kashyyyk. (Mustafar has no associated space zone.) Kessel and Deep Space have no planets and are used for high-level gameplay and player-versus-player combat. The Ord Mantell sector was released in January 2008 as a new space-only zone, though there is a space station there (called Nova Orion) where pilots can land and acquire quests. The planet Hoth was added in November 2008 as part of an instance, but could only be explored during the events of the Battle of Echo Base. Examples of characters and points of interest that players could visit within the game include R2-D2, C-3PO, their escape pod on Tatooine, the Naboo Royal Palace, the abandoned Rebel bases on Dantooine and Yavin 4, the notorious pirate Nym in his stronghold on Lok, Ewoks and Rancors. Other main characters include Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Darth Vader, Chewbacca, Emperor Palpatine, Admiral Ackbar, Jan Dodonna, Boba Fett, Jabba, Borvo the Hutt, Bib Fortuna, Salacious Crumb, General Otto, Captain Panaka (appears as Colonel Panaka), Max Rebo, Wedge Antilles, Gavyn Sykes, Watto, Boss Nass, the \\"reincarnation\\" of General Grievous as NK-Necrosis, Taga Olak, Jefa Bowa and the Force ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi. References are also made of characters from the Star Wars expanded universe, such as Grand Admiral Thrawn. Mara Jade from the Thrawn trilogy could be found in the Deathwatch bunker, as well as in Theed on Naboo for Empire Day. HK-47 from the Knights of the Old Republic video games is the main boss involved in the Champion of Mustafar quest. The game also references the other two Star Wars spin-off films, in that the player may encounter the Gorax species from Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure, and the base of the Sanyassan Marauders, as seen in Ewoks: The Battle for Endor. Gameplay The ten species that were available to players included: Human, Twi'lek, Zabrak, Wookiee, Trandoshan, Rodian, Mon Calamari, Bothan, Sullustan and Ithorian. There were nine professions in the game after the NGE (34 pre-NGE): Jedi, Bounty Hunter, Smuggler, Commando, Spy, Officer, Medic, Entertainer and Trader. Trader was further divided into four separate professions: Domestic Goods (tailoring and cooking), Engineering (droid and vehicle crafting), Structures (shipwright and architect), Munitions (weapons and armor crafting). Progress in these professions was divided into three separate experience source groups: combat, crafting and entertaining. In addition to these professions, a character could also pursue three optional (they could be advanced in regardless of chosen main profession nor progress in it): Pilot, Chronicler and Politician. During the Pre-NGE, customization was easier due to \\"skill points\\" which could be spread amongst many different profession trees. *Pilot sub-profession allowed users to load out and use spaceships specific to three different career paths represented GCW alignment (Imperial, Neutral, and Rebel). Advancement in profession was based on obtaining experience via space combat and completion of missions assigned by chosen wing command (three different available for each faction). Pilots may also enter atmospheric flight mode and engage in combat attacking targets on planet surface (i.e. opposing faction PvP flagged players). *Chronicler sub- profession allowed to build holocrons with player created quests: placed props (temporarily existing in game world items and NPCs), objectives and narration. Advancement in profession is based on obtaining experience via constructing holocrones and having other players complete and rate such creations. *Politician profession allowed users to create and manage a player city. Acquired and completed automatically when a player places a structure belonging to him. Characters could specialize in three different areas of their main professions by selecting \\"expertise\\" options, including Beast Mastery (BM). The Trader professions shared not only BM expertise but also general expertise (which include specializing in resource sampling and mining via player placed structures - harvesters, reverse engineering, manufacturing via player placed structures - factories and vendors maintenance), third expertise consists of two given trader type specific areas of crafting specialization. All professions were combat capable although with definite bias towards combat professions prowess, followed by entertainers (HtH combat based on Drama expertise and/or BM expertise) and traders (combat based solely on pet crafted droids or BM expertise). Although some of combat professions are more prone to fall into generic roles of tank/dps/support all of them can specialize via expertise and correctly built items configuration (armor/clothing and weaponry is entirely player created and developed; its quality, enhancements and efficiency based on crafter's equipment and quality and proper composition of resources; drop and quest reward items are sub-par). This system allows the combat to be more balanced between different professions, while retaining variety of playstyles. The only generic role reserved to single profession is healer, as only Medic can heal another character. However all combat professions have sustainable self healing option. The Jump to Lightspeed expansion made individual ships attainable by players for the first time. This allowed players to acquire and pilot ships of various sizes. Ships ranged in size from small one-man fighter craft to larger gunships with up to three decks. Some players choose to play most of the game in space, while others play in both space and planetary settings. The TCG has added in a few other ships, as well as certain updates. With the NGE, ground combat was changed to real-time and similar to a first-person shooter. The player must aim a targeting reticule at a target and left-click the mouse to fire. Auto-aim and auto-fire features are available, creating a more traditional combat experience, but players eschewing those options are rewarded with an increased chance to do maximum damage. As characters gain levels, they gain access to additional combat abilities called \\"specials\\" which are activated by using the right mouse button or by clicking the ability on a toolbar. These specials usually have a cool-down period. In addition to providing especially powerful damage attacks, specials are also used to heal, buff, debuff and crowd control. Players gain the ability to use more powerful weapons as they advance in level. Players also earn \\"Expertise Points\\" as they level up which they can use in their professions expertise \\"tree\\". The player can allot 45 points into various abilities and attributes to make their characters more diverse, from weapons specialties to healing and armor proficiency. Once a character reaches the max level 90 they would be able to do \\"Heroic\\" missions with a group of up to 8 other players. Before you could enter a Heroic mission the character has to complete a pre-quest that would unlock the quest and give permission to enter the instance. To acquire the mission you had to speak to a certain NPC to start the quest and after completing granted access. The five heroic missions were: Tusken Invasion, IG88, Axkva Min, Imperial Star Destroyer, and Exar Kun. After completing these heroics you were granted one token from that instance and would have to wait another 24 hours before re-entering for more tokens. Tokens collected would get you a 5 piece jewelry set that granted advantages for that profession. Characters can erect, own and decorate a variety of buildings, including houses, cantinas, theaters, hospitals, guild halls and city halls. These buildings, when grouped, can be organized into cities. Players hold election] via ballot box for Mayor. Elected mayors grant city members certain rights to place structures within the city and disallow the use of various civic structures by individual players as needed. Elections are held every three weeks. If another player wishes to run for mayor they can add their name at any time to the ballot box to run against the incumbent. As cities grow in population, they become eligible to add services and facilities such as vehicle repair garages, shuttleports, cloning facilities, hospitals, cantinas and garden displays. They can show up on the planet maps alongside canonical cities such as Theed and Mos Eisley. The gameplay design encouraged realistic social institutions such as a dynamic player economy and other real-life social phenomena like a complicated division of labor. According to Star Wars Galaxies and the Division of Labor, the division of labor in Star Wars Galaxies around April 2005 produced in-game results similar to those in real life. Galaxies' original game design socialized players to specialize their characters by mastering one or two professions, and to join guilds, in which players relate to one another primarily in terms of their professions. =Other features= * Single- and multi-passenger ground vehicles and starships (podracers, landspeeders, speeder bikes, swoops, X-wings, TIE fighters and YT series ships). * Player-run virtual economy where player characters are responsible for creating many in-game items including blasters, starships, clothing, armor, food, housing, furniture and even a wide variety of droids. Items are created from player-collected raw materials and looted items. * An extensive set of emotes, moods, and associated animations, which affect not only an avatar's physical appearance but also the text used to describe a character's speech, and even the shape of the speech bubble displayed on-screen. * The ability for players to place bounties on opponents that participate in PvP. Player character bounty hunters can then pick up another character's \\"bounty mission\\" on the terminals and track the character down. A bounty can be claimed at any time, regardless of the target's PvP setting. Up to three bounty hunters can be tracking a character at any given time. * Dynamic resource spawns on planets needed for complex crafting. Each having unique name and random quality of appropriate resource statistics. Resources are divided into complex tree of origins and properties. All player made items require specific resources listed in schematic. Statistics of gathered and used resources determine item's parameters. * An extensive character creation system. Characters can hire Entertainers to change their appearance in-game, with even more options than those available at creation. Many visual aspects of a character are thereby changeable at any time after character creation except species and gender. * The game references and features elements from Star Wars Holiday Special, such as Lumpy's stuffed bantha, and the customs of Life Day, when the player visits Kashyyyk. The red Life Day robes that the Wookiees wore are also available during special events in the game. * Large player run environments with complex ranking systems tailored towards each Player Association (PA). These organizations were run by player leaders and had the ability to make social alliances, and trade deals. PA's developed with complexity as players role played through the maturity of the game. =Star Wars Galaxies compilations= On top of the expansions, SOE released several compilations of their games: ;Star Wars Galaxies - The Total Experience :This pack included the original Star Wars Galaxies (An Empire Divided), Jump to Lightspeed and the Rage of the Wookiees expansion packs. Customers who bought this pack also received a BARC speeder as a gift. ;Star Wars Galaxies - Starter Kit :The kit was the first version of the New Game Enhancement (NGE). It contained An Empire Divided and Jump to Lightspeed. Customers who bought this pack also received an X-wing or TIE fighter instant transport vehicle as a gift. ;Star Wars Galaxies - The Complete Online Adventures :This included the original game with the first three expansion packs, a DVD of never-before released bonus features, a slide show of more than 800 pieces of Star Wars Galaxies concept art and screenshots, all set to more than an hour of orchestral in-game music, excerpts from the popular ‚ÄúFrom Pencil to Pixel‚Äù book that chronicles the art of Star Wars Galaxies and interviews with the producers, and all the cinematic trailers for the game. It also included an exclusive in-game item for use while playing ‚Äì a personal AT- RT vehicle as seen in Revenge of the Sith. This version was the first to be released in Australia, instead of An Empire Divided. ;Star Wars Galaxies - The Complete Online Adventures Premium Digital Download :This included An Empire Divided, Jump to Lightspeed, Rage of the Wookiees, Trials of Obi-Wan, and players who purchase it also receive a bonus instant travel vehicle, the Queen Amidala Transport Ship and an AT-RT walker. No disc media is provided as it is an Internet download, which later came with a Queen Amidala Transport Ship (one per character), a General Grievous Wheel Bike, a Double seated Bike for the player and a friend (one per character), a Lava Flea mount (one per account), an Underground Mustafar Bunker player house (one per account), an AT-RT walker mount (one per account), a Varactyl mount (one per account). Reception In the United States, Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided sold 370,000 copies ($16.1 million) by August 2006, after its release in June 2003. It was the country's 43rd best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. Combined sales of all Star Wars Galaxies-related games released between January 2000 and August 2006 had reached 720,000 units in the United States by the latter date. Reviews for the initial launch of the game in 2003 were mostly positive. The game was praised for its lush graphics (realistic character models, detailed architecture and lush environments), liberal use of the movie soundtracks, massive world size, character customization, creative creature ecology, complex skill system, player economy interdependencies and its sandbox approach. Reviewers criticized the overwhelming complexity of the game, combat imbalances of the professions, bugginess and lack of quest content. The reviews for the first expansion, Jump to Lightspeed, praised the new space combat but criticized the ground game for its lack of sufficient improvement. The reviews for the second expansion, Rage of the Wookiees, lauded the new quest content for current subscribers but lamented the combat gameplay updates and the continued bugginess of the game. Players who wished to play a Jedi character had to first unlock their Jedi slot by fulfilling an unknown list of criteria. The first player to unlock a 'Jedi slot' did so on November 7, 2003, four months after the release of the game. Players criticized SOE for the substantial time commitment to unlock a Jedi, penalties for in-game death of a Jedi character which was permanent after three deaths, and monotonous game play required to acquire the Jedi character. Developers responded by changing the penalty for death to skill loss in January 2004 and creating a quest system to unlock the character. Media outlets criticized the changes of the \\"Combat Upgrade\\" while subscription cancellations rose. After the New Game Enhancements were implemented in November 2005, sparking huge demonstrations in-game from the majority of players, various media outlets criticized the reduced depth and complexity of the game, but John Smedley, president of Sony Online Entertainment, defended the decision claiming it necessary to revamp the game in order to reverse the deterioration they were seeing in the subscriber base. SOE offered refunds on the Trials of Obi-Wan expansion due to it being released two days before the New Game Enhancement was announced. The development team affirmed this was their desired direction for the game and that they would modify parameters to address player's concerns. Features such as expertise trees were later added to the game to add complexity and differentiation to characters. After the announcement that SOE had acquired the game Vanguard: Saga of Heroes, Smedley addressed that game's players about the perceived threat of major changes to the game: \\"We've learned a thing or two with our experiences with the NGE and don't plan on repeating mistakes from the past and not listening to the players.\\" Subscriber numbers were originally expected to exceed 1,000,000. In August 2005, SOE reported that they had sold 1,000,000 boxed copies of the game. In early 2006, unconfirmed reports showed that only 10,363 subscribers were playing on a particular Friday night, but Smedley denied that subscriptions had fallen this low. In an online interview with Reddit in July 2012, John Smedley admitted to \\"stupid decisions\\" regarding Star Wars Galaxies combat upgrade and new gaming enhancement policies, and acknowledged player led emulator projects seeking to restore a free-to-play Galaxies circa April 2005, Publish 14.1, pre-Combat Upgrade, such as the SWGEmu project or the New Game Enhancements Upgrade, such as Project SWG. Novelization Star Wars Galaxies: The Ruins of Dantooine is a novel based in part on places and events in the game. It was authored by Voronica Whitney-Robinson and Haden Blackman, the LucasArts producer of the game. It was released in December 2003.

Exposure can be from a source of radiation external to the human body or due to internal irradiation caused by the ingestion of radioactive contamination. Ionizing radiation is widely used in industry and medicine, and can present a significant health hazard by causing microscopic damage to living tissue. There are two main categories of ionizing radiation health effects. At high exposures, it can cause \\"tissue\\" effects, also called \\"deterministic\\" effects due to the certainty of them happening, conventionally indicated by the unit gray and resulting in acute radiation syndrome. For low level exposures there can be statistically elevated risks of radiation-induced cancer, called \\"stochastic effects\\" due to the uncertainty of them happening, conventionally indicated by the unit sievert. Fundamental to radiation protection is the avoidance or reduction of dose using the simple protective measures of time, distance and shielding. The duration of exposure should be limited to that necessary, the distance from the source of radiation should be maximised, and the source shielded wherever possible. To measure personal dose uptake in occupational or emergency exposure, for external radiation personal dosimeters are used, and for internal dose to due to ingestion of radioactive contamination, bioassay techniques are applied. For radiation protection and dosimetry assessment the International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) and International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) publish recommendations and data which is used to calculate the biological effects on the human body of certain levels of radiation, and thereby advise acceptable dose uptake limits. Principles International policy relationships in radiological protection External dose quantities used in radiation protection and dosimetry - based on ICRU report 57 Graphic showing relationships between radioactivity and detected ionizing radiation The ICRP recommends, develops and maintains the International System of Radiological Protection, based on evaluation of the large body of scientific studies available to equate risk to received dose levels. The system's health objectives are \\"to manage and control exposures to ionising radiation so that deterministic effects are prevented, and the risks of stochastic effects are reduced to the extent reasonably achievable\\". The ICRP's recommendations flow down to national and regional regulators, which have the opportunity to incorporate them into their own law; this process is shown in the accompanying block diagram. In most countries a national regulatory authority works towards ensuring a secure radiation environment in society by setting dose limitation requirements that are generally based on the recommendations of the ICRP. =Exposure situations= The ICRP recognises planned, emergency, and existing exposure situations, as described below; * Planned exposure ‚Äì defined as \\"...where radiological protection can be planned in advance, before exposures occur, and where the magnitude and extent of the exposures can be reasonably predicted.\\" These are such as in occupational exposure situations, where it is necessary for personnel to work in a known radiation environment. * Emergency exposure ‚Äì defined as \\"...unexpected situations that may require urgent protective actions\\". This would be such as an emergency nuclear event. * Existing exposure ‚Äì defined as \\"...being those that already exist when a decision on control has to be taken\\". These can be such as from naturally occurring radioactive materials which exist in the environment. =Regulation of dose uptake= The ICRP uses the following overall principles for all controllable exposure situations. * Justification: No unnecessary use of radiation is permitted, which means that the advantages must outweigh the disadvantages. * Limitation: Each individual must be protected against risks that are too great, through the application of individual radiation dose limits. * Optimization: This process is intended for application to those situations that have been deemed to be justified. It means \\"the likelihood of incurring exposures, the number of people exposed, and the magnitude of their individual doses\\" should all be kept as Low As Reasonably Achievable (known as ALARA or ALARP). It takes into account economic and societal factors. =Factors in external dose uptake= There are three factors that control the amount, or dose, of radiation received from a source. Radiation exposure can be managed by a combination of these factors: #Time: Reducing the time of an exposure reduces the effective dose proportionally. An example of reducing radiation doses by reducing the time of exposures might be improving operator training to reduce the time they take to handle a radioactive source. #Distance: Increasing distance reduces dose due to the inverse square law. Distance can be as simple as handling a source with forceps rather than fingers.For example if a problem arise during fluoroscopic procedure step away from the patient if feasible. #Shielding: Sources of radiation can be shielded with solid or liquid material, which absorbs the energy of the radiation. The term 'biological shield' is used for absorbing material placed around a nuclear reactor, or other source of radiation, to reduce the radiation to a level safe for humans.The shielding materials are concrete and lead shield which is 0.25mm thick for secondary radiation and 0.5mm thick for primary radiation =Internal dose uptake= Large scale glovebox in the nuclear industry used to contain airborne radioactive particles. Internal dose, due to the inhalation or ingestion of radioactive substances, can result in stochastic or deterministic effects, depending on the amount of radioactive material ingested and other biokinetic factors. The risk from a low level internal source is represented by the dose quantity committed dose, which has the same risk as the same amount of external effective dose. The intake of radioactive material can occur through four pathways: *inhalation of airborne contaminants such as radon gas and radioactive particles *ingestion of radioactive contamination in food or liquids *absorption of vapours such as tritium oxide through the skin *injection of medical radioisotopes such as technetium-99m The occupational hazards from airborne radioactive particles in nuclear and radio-chemical applications are greatly reduced by the extensive use of gloveboxes to contain such material. To protect against breathing in radioactive particles in ambient air, respirators with particulate filters are worn. To monitor the concentration of radioactive particles in ambient air, radioactive particulate monitoring instruments measure the concentration or presence of airborne materials. For ingested radioactive materials in food and drink, specialist laboratory radiometric assay methods are used to measure the concentration of such materials. = Recommended limits on dose uptake = USA Dept of Energy 2010 dose chart in sieverts for a variety of situations and applications.Various doses of radiation in sieverts, ranging from trivial to lethal. The ICRP recommends a number of limits for dose uptake in table 8 of ICRP report 103. These limits are \\"situational\\", for planned, emergency and existing situations. Within these situations, limits are given for certain exposed groups; * Planned exposure ‚Äì limits given for occupational, medical and public exposure. The occupational exposure limit of effective dose is 20 mSv per year, averaged over defined periods of 5 years, with no single year exceeding 50 mSv. The public exposure limit is 1 mSv in a year. * Emergency exposure ‚Äì limits given for occupational and public exposure * Existing exposure ‚Äì reference levels for all persons exposed Further detail of some of the limits can be found on the ICRPedia page. The public information dose chart of the USA Department of Energy, shown here on the right, applies to USA regulation, which is based on ICRP recommendations. Note that examples in lines 1 to 4 have a scale of dose rate (radiation per unit time), whilst 5 and 6 have a scale of total accumulated dose. =ALARP & ALARA= ALARP is an acronym for an important principle in exposure to radiation and other occupational health risks and in the UK stands for \\"As Low As Reasonably Practicable\\".This is the wording used by the national regulatory authority that coined the term, in turn derived from its enabling legislation: Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974: The aim is to minimize the risk of radioactive exposure or other hazard while keeping in mind that some exposure may be acceptable in order to further the task at hand. The equivalent term ALARA, \\"As Low As Reasonably Achievable\\", is more commonly used outside the UK. This compromise is well illustrated in radiology. The application of radiation can aid the patient by providing doctors and other health care professionals with a medical diagnosis, but the exposure of the patient should be reasonably low enough to keep the statistical probability of cancers or sarcomas (stochastic effects) below an acceptable level, and to eliminate deterministic effects (e.g. skin reddening or cataracts). An acceptable level of incidence of stochastic effects is considered to be equal for a worker to the risk in other radiation work generally considered to be safe. This policy is based on the principle that any amount of radiation exposure, no matter how small, can increase the chance of negative biological effects such as cancer. It is also based on the principle that the probability of the occurrence of negative effects of radiation exposure increases with cumulative lifetime dose. These ideas are combined to form the linear no-threshold model which says that there is not a threshold at which there is an increase in the rate of occurrence of stochastic effects with increasing dose. At the same time, radiology and other practices that involve use of ionizing radiation bring benefits, so reducing radiation exposure can reduce the efficacy of a medical practice. The economic cost, for example of adding a barrier against radiation, must also be considered when applying the ALARP principle. Computed Tomography, better known as C.T. Scans or CAT Scans have made an enormous contribution to medicine, however not without some risk. They use ionizing radiation which can cause cancer, especially in children. When caregivers follow proper indications for their use and child safe techniques rather than adult techniques, downstream cancer can be prevented. Personal radiation dosimeters The radiation dosimeter is an important personal dose measuring instrument. It is worn by the person being monitored and is used to estimate the external radiation dose deposited in the individual wearing the device. They are used for gamma, X-ray, beta and other strongly penetrating radiation, but not for weakly penetrating radiation such as alpha particles. Traditionally, film badges were used for long-term monitoring, and quartz fibre dosimeters for short-term monitoring. However, these have been mostly superseded by thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) badges and electronic dosimeters. Electronic dosimeters can give an alarm warning if a preset dose threshold has been reached, enabling safer working in potentially higher radiation levels, where the received dose must be continually monitored. Workers exposed to radiation, such as radiographers, nuclear power plant workers, doctors using radiotherapy, those in laboratories using radionuclides, and HAZMAT teams are required to wear dosimeters so a record of occupational exposure can be made. Such devices are generally termed \\"legal dosimeters\\" if they have been approved for use in recording personnel dose for regulatory purposes. Dosimeters can be worn to obtain a whole body dose and there are also specialist types that can be worn on the fingers or clipped to headgear, to measure the localised body irradiation for specific activities. Common types of wearable dosimeters for ionizing radiation include:Advances in kilovoltage x-ray beam dosimetry by Hill et al in http://iopscience.iop.org/0031-9155/59/6/R183/article * Film badge dosimeter * Quartz fibre dosimeter * Electronic personal dosimeter * Thermoluminescent dosimeter Radiation shielding Diagram showing various forms of ionizing radiation, and the sort of material that is used to stop or reduce that type. The total absorption coefficient of lead (atomic number 82) for gamma rays, plotted versus gamma energy, and the contributions by the three effects. Here, the photoelectric effect dominates at low energy. Above 5 MeV, pair production starts to dominate. A lead castle built to shield a radioactive sample in a lab, being a form of lead shielding. Almost any material can act as a shield from gamma or x-rays if used in sufficient amounts. Different types of ionizing radiation interact in different ways with shielding material. The effectiveness of shielding is dependent on stopping power, which varies with the type and energy of radiation and the shielding material used. Different shielding techniques are therefore used depending on the application and the type and energy of the radiation. Shielding reduces the intensity of radiation, increasing with thickness. This is an exponential relationship with gradually diminishing effect as equal slices of shielding material are added. A quantity known as the halving-thicknesses is used to calculate this. For example, a practical shield in a fallout shelter with ten halving-thicknesses of packed dirt, which is roughly , reduces gamma rays to 1/1024 of their original intensity (i.e. 2‚àí10). The effectiveness of a shielding material in general increases with its atomic number, called Z, except for neutron shielding, which is more readily shielded by the likes of neutron absorbers and moderators such as compounds of boron e.g. boric acid, cadmium, carbon and hydrogen. Graded-Z shielding is a laminate of several materials with different Z values (atomic numbers) designed to protect against ionizing radiation. Compared to single-material shielding, the same mass of graded-Z shielding has been shown to reduce electron penetration over 60%. It is commonly used in satellite-based particle detectors, offering several benefits: * protection from radiation damage * reduction of background noise for detectors * lower mass compared to single-material shielding Designs vary, but typically involve a gradient from high-Z (usually tantalum) through successively lower-Z elements such as tin, steel, and copper, usually ending with aluminium. Sometimes even lighter materials such as polypropylene or boron carbide are used. In a typical graded-Z shield, the high-Z layer effectively scatters protons and electrons. It also absorbs gamma rays, which produces X-ray fluorescence. Each subsequent layer absorbs the X-ray fluorescence of the previous material, eventually reducing the energy to a suitable level. Each decrease in energy produces bremsstrahlung and Auger electrons, which are below the detector's energy threshold. Some designs also include an outer layer of aluminium, which may simply be the skin of the satellite. The effectiveness of a material as a biological shield is related to its cross- section for scattering and absorption, and to a first approximation is proportional to the total mass of material per unit area interposed along the line of sight between the radiation source and the region to be protected. Hence, shielding strength or \\"thickness\\" is conventionally measured in units of g/cm2. The radiation that manages to get through falls exponentially with the thickness of the shield. In x-ray facilities, walls surrounding the room with the x-ray generator may contain lead shielding such as lead sheets, or the plaster may contain barium sulfate. Operators view the target through a leaded glass screen, or if they must remain in the same room as the target, wear lead aprons. =Particle radiation= Particle radiation consists of a stream of charged or neutral particles, both charged ions and subatomic elementary particles. This includes solar wind, cosmic radiation, and neutron flux in nuclear reactors. * Alpha particles (helium nuclei) are the least penetrating. Even very energetic alpha particles can be stopped by a single sheet of paper. * Beta particles (electrons) are more penetrating, but still can be absorbed by a few mm of aluminium. However, in cases where high-energy beta particles are emitted, shielding must be accomplished with low atomic weight materials, e.g. plastic, wood, water, or acrylic glass (Plexiglas, Lucite). This is to reduce generation of bremsstrahlung X-rays. In the case of beta+ radiation (positrons), the gamma radiation from the electron-positron annihilation reaction poses additional concern. * Neutron radiation is not as readily absorbed as charged particle radiation, which makes this type highly penetrating. Neutrons are absorbed by nuclei of atoms in a nuclear reaction. This most often creates a secondary radiation hazard, as the absorbing nuclei transmute to the next-heavier isotope, many of which are unstable. * Cosmic radiation is not a common concern on Earth, as the Earth's atmosphere absorbs it and the magnetosphere acts as a shield, but it poses a significant problem for satellites and astronauts, especially while passing through the Van Allen Belt or while completely outside the protective regions of the Earth's magnetosphere. Frequent fliers may be at a slightly higher risk because of the decreased absorption from thinner atmosphere. Cosmic radiation is extremely high energy, and is very penetrating. =Electromagnetic radiation= Electromagnetic radiation consists of emissions of electromagnetic waves, the properties of which depend on the wavelength. * X-ray and gamma radiation are best absorbed by atoms with heavy nuclei; the heavier the nucleus, the better the absorption. In some special applications, depleted uranium or thoriumHistorical Use of Thorium at Hanford are used, but lead is much more common; several cm are often required. Barium sulfate is used in some applications too. However, when cost is important, almost any material can be used, but it must be far thicker. Most nuclear reactors use thick concrete shields to create a bioshield with a thin water-cooled layer of lead on the inside to protect the porous concrete from the coolant inside. The concrete is also made with heavy aggregates, such as Baryte or MagnaDense (Magnetite), to aid in the shielding properties of the concrete. Gamma rays are better absorbed by materials with high atomic numbers and high density, although neither effect is important compared to the total mass per area in the path of the gamma ray. * Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is ionizing in its shortest wavelengths but is not penetrating, so it can be shielded by thin opaque layers such as sunscreen, clothing, and protective eyewear. Protection from UV is simpler than for the other forms of radiation above, so it is often considered separately. In some cases, improper shielding can actually make the situation worse, when the radiation interacts with the shielding material and creates secondary radiation that absorbs in the organisms more readily. For example, although high atomic number materials are very effective in shielding photons, using them to shield beta particles may cause higher radiation exposure due to the production of bremsstrahlung x-rays, and hence low atomic number materials are recommended. Also, using material with a high neutron activation cross section to shield neutrons will result in the shielding material itself becoming radioactive and hence more dangerous than if it were not present.  Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)‚ÄîRadiation  Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) includes all clothing and accessories which can be worn to prevent severe illness and injury as a result of exposure to radioactive material. Because radiation can affect humans through internal and external contamination, various protection strategies have been developed to protect humans from the harmful effects of radiation exposure from a spectrum of sources. A few of these strategies developed to shield from internal, external, and high energy radiation are outlined below. = Internal Contamination Protective Equipment = Internal contamination protection equipment protects against the inhalation and ingestion of radioactive material. Internal deposition of radioactive material result in direct exposure of radiation to organs and tissues inside the body. The respiratory protective equipment described below are designed to minimize the possibility of such material being inhaled or ingested as emergency workers are exposed to potentially radioactive environments. Reusable Air Purifying Respirators (APR) * Elastic face piece worn over the mouth and nose * Contains filters, cartridges, and canisters to provide increased protection and better filtration Powered Air-Purifying Respirator (PAPR) * Battery powered blower forces contamination through air purifying filters * Purified air delivered under positive pressure to face piece Supplied-Air Respirator (SAR) * Compressed air delivered from a stationary source to the face piece Auxiliary Escape Respirator * Protects wearer from breathing harmful gases, vapours, fumes, and dust * Can be designed as an air-purifying escape respirator (APER) or a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) type respirator * SCBA type escape respirators have an attached source of breathing air and a hood that provides a barrier against contaminated outside air Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) * Provides very pure, dry compressed air to full facepiece mask via a hose * Air is exhaled to environment * Worn when entering environments immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) or when information is inadequate to rule out IDLH atmosphere = External Contamination Protective Equipment = External contamination protection equipment provides a barrier to shield radioactive material from being deposited externally on the body or clothes. The dermal protective equipment described below acts as a barrier to block radioactive material from physically touching the skin, but does not protect against externally penetrating high energy radiation. Chemical-Resistant Inner Suit * Porous overall suit‚ÄîDermal protection from aerosols, dry particles, and non hazardous liquids. * Non-porous overall suit to provide dermal protection from: ** Dry powders and solids ** Blood-borne pathogens and bio-hazards ** Chemical splashes and inorganic acid/base aerosols ** Mild liquid chemical splashes from toxics and corrosives ** Toxic industrial chemicals and materials Level C Equivalent: Bunker Gear * Firefighter protective clothing * Flame/water resistant * Helmet, gloves, foot gear, and hood Level B Equivalent‚ÄîNon-gas- tight Encapsulating Suit * Designed for environments that are immediate health risks but contain no substances that can be absorbed by skin Level A Equivalent‚ÄîTotally Encapsulating Chemical- and Vapour-Protective Suit * Designed for environments that are immediate health risks and contain substances that can be absorbed by skin = External penetrating radiation = There are many solutions to shielding against low-energy radiation exposure like low-energy X-rays. Lead shielding wear such as lead aprons can protect patients and clinicians from the potentially harmful radiation effects of day- to-day medical examinations. It is quite feasible to protect large surface areas of the body from radiation in the lower-energy spectrum because very little shielding material is required to provide the necessary protection. Recent studies show that copper shielding is far more effective than lead and is likely to replace it as the standard material for radiation shielding. Personal shielding against more energetic radiation such as gamma radiation is very difficult to achieve as the large mass of shielding material required to properly protect the entire body would make functional movement nearly impossible. For this, partial body shielding of radio-sensitive internal organs is the most viable protection strategy. The immediate danger of intense exposure to high-energy gamma radiation is Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS), a result of irreversible bone marrow damage. The concept of selective shielding is based in the regenerative potential of the hematopoietic stem cells found in bone marrow. The regenerative quality of stem cells make it only necessary to protect enough bone marrow to repopulate the body with unaffected stem cells after the exposure: a similar concept which is applied in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which is a common treatment for patients suffering from leukemia. This scientific advancement allows for the development of a new class of relatively lightweight protective equipment that shields high concentrations of bone marrow to defer the hematopoietic sub- syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome to much higher dosages. One technique is to apply selective shielding to protect the high concentration of bone marrow stored in the hips and other radio-sensitive organs in the abdominal area. This allows first responders a safe way to perform necessary missions in radioactive environments. Radiation protection instruments Practical radiation measurement using calibrated radiation protection instruments is essential in evaluating the effectiveness of protection measures, and in assessing the radiation dose likely to be received by individuals. The measuring instruments for radiation protection are both \\"installed\\" (in a fixed position) and portable (hand-held or transportable). =Installed instruments= Installed instruments are fixed in positions which are known to be important in assessing the general radiation hazard in an area. Examples are installed \\"area\\" radiation monitors, Gamma interlock monitors, personnel exit monitors, and airborne particulate monitors. The area radiation monitor will measure the ambient radiation, usually X-Ray, Gamma or neutrons; these are radiations that can have significant radiation levels over a range in excess of tens of metres from their source, and thereby cover a wide area. Gamma radiation \\"interlock monitors\\" are used in applications to prevent inadvertent exposure of workers to an excess dose by preventing personnel access to an area when a high radiation level is present. These interlock the process access directly. Airborne contamination monitors measure the concentration of radioactive particles in the ambient air to guard against radioactive particles being ingested, or deposited in the lungs of personnel. These instruments will normally give a local alarm, but are often connected to an integrated safety system so that areas of plant can be evacuated and personnel are prevented from entering an air of high airborne contamination. Personnel exit monitors (PEM) are used to monitor workers who are exiting a \\"contamination controlled\\" or potentially contaminated area. These can be in the form of hand monitors, clothing frisk probes, or whole body monitors. These monitor the surface of the workers body and clothing to check if any radioactive contamination has been deposited. These generally measure alpha or beta or gamma, or combinations of these. The UK National Physical Laboratory publishes a good practice guide through its Ionising Radiation Metrology Forum concerning the provision of such equipment and the methodology of calculating the alarm levels to be used.Operational Monitoring Good Practice Guide \\"The Selection of Alarm Levels for Personnel Exit Monitors\\" Dec 2009 - National Physical Laboratory, Teddington UK =Portable instruments= Hand-held ion chamber survey meter in use for surface dose rate on one of three radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) for the Cassini spacecraft. Portable instruments are hand-held or transportable. The hand-held instrument is generally used as a survey meter to check an object or person in detail, or assess an area where no installed instrumentation exists. They can also be used for personnel exit monitoring or personnel contamination checks in the field. These generally measure alpha, beta or gamma, or combinations of these. Transportable instruments are generally instruments that would have been permanently installed, but are temporarily placed in an area to provide continuous monitoring where it is likely there will be a hazard. Such instruments are often installed on trolleys to allow easy deployment, and are associated with temporary operational situations. In the United Kingdom the HSE has issued a user guidance note on selecting the correct radiation measurement instrument for the application concerned. Selection, use and maintenance of portable monitoring instruments. UK HSE This covers all radiation instrument technologies, and is a useful comparative guide. =Instrument types= A number of commonly used detection instrument types are listed below, and are used for both fixed and survey monitoring. *ionization chambers *proportional counters *Geiger counters *semiconductor detectors *scintillation detectors *airborne particulate radioactivity monitoring The links should be followed for a fuller description of each. Radiation related quantities The following table shows the main radiation- related quantities and units. Spacecraft radiation challenges Spacecraft, both robotic and crewed, must cope with the high radiation environment of outer space. Radiation emitted by the Sun and other galactic sources, and trapped in radiation \\"belts\\" is more dangerous and hundreds of times more intense than radiation sources such as medical X-rays or normal cosmic radiation usually experienced on Earth. When the intensely ionizing particles found in space strike human tissue, it can result in cell damage and may eventually lead to cancer. The usual method for radiation protection is material shielding by spacecraft and equipment structures (usually aluminium), possibly augmented by polyethylene in human spaceflight where the main concern is high-energy protons and cosmic ray ions. On unmanned spacecraft in high- electron-dose environments such as Jupiter missions, or medium Earth orbit (MEO), additional shielding with materials of a high atomic number can be effective. On long-duration manned missions, advantage can be taken of the good shielding characteristics of liquid hydrogen fuel and water. The NASA Space Radiation Laboratory makes use of a particle accelerator that produces beams of protons or heavy ions. These ions are typical of those accelerated in cosmic sources and by the Sun. The beams of ions move through a 100 m (328-foot) transport tunnel to the 37 m2 (400-square-foot) shielded target hall. There, they hit the target, which may be a biological sample or shielding material. In a 2002 NASA study, it was determined that materials that have high hydrogen contents, such as polyethylene, can reduce primary and secondary radiation to a greater extent than metals, such as aluminum. The problem with this \\"passive shielding\\" method is that radiation interactions in the material generate secondary radiation. Active Shielding, that is, using magnets, high voltages, or artificial magnetospheres to slow down or deflect radiation, has been considered to potentially combat radiation in a feasible way. So far, the cost of equipment, power and weight of active shielding equipment outweigh their benefits. For example, active radiation equipment would need a habitable volume size to house it, and magnetic and electrostatic configurations often are not homogenous in intensity, allowing high-energy particles to penetrate the magnetic and electric fields from low-intensity parts, like cusps in dipolar magnetic field of Earth. As of 2012, NASA is undergoing research in superconducting magnetic architecture for potential active shielding applications. Early radiation dangers Using early Crookes tube X-Ray apparatus in 1896. One man is viewing his hand with a fluoroscope to optimise tube emissions, the other has his head close to the tube. No precautions are being taken. Monument to the X-ray and Radium Martyrs of All Nations erected 1936 at St. Georg hospital in Hamburg, commemorating 359 early radiology workers. The dangers of radioactivity and radiation were not immediately recognized. The discovery of x‚Äërays in 1895 led to widespread experimentation by scientists, physicians, and inventors. Many people began recounting stories of burns, hair loss and worse in technical journals as early as 1896. In February of that year, Professor Daniel and Dr. Dudley of Vanderbilt University performed an experiment involving x-raying Dudley's head that resulted in his hair loss. A report by Dr. H.D. Hawks, a graduate of Columbia College, of his suffering severe hand and chest burns in an x-ray demonstration, was the first of many other reports in Electrical Review. Many experimenters including Elihu Thomson at Thomas Edison's lab, William J. Morton, and Nikola Tesla also reported burns. Elihu Thomson deliberately exposed a finger to an x-ray tube over a period of time and suffered pain, swelling, and blistering.Ronald L. Kathern and Paul L. Ziemer, he First Fifty Years of Radiation Protection, physics.isu.edu Other effects, including ultraviolet rays and ozone were sometimes blamed for the damage. Many physicists claimed that there were no effects from x-ray exposure at all. As early as 1902 William Herbert Rollins wrote almost despairingly that his warnings about the dangers involved in careless use of x-rays was not being heeded, either by industry or by his colleagues. By this time Rollins had proved that x-rays could kill experimental animals, could cause a pregnant guinea pig to abort, and that they could kill a fetus. He also stressed that \\"animals vary in susceptibility to the external action of X-light\\" and warned that these differences be considered when patients were treated by means of x-rays. Before the biological effects of radiation were known, many physicists and corporations began marketing radioactive substances as patent medicine in the form of glow-in-the-dark pigments. Examples were radium enema treatments, and radium-containing waters to be drunk as tonics. Marie Curie protested against this sort of treatment, warning that the effects of radiation on the human body were not well understood. Curie later died from aplastic anaemia, likely caused by exposure to ionizing radiation. By the 1930s, after a number of cases of bone necrosis and death of radium treatment enthusiasts, radium- containing medicinal products had been largely removed from the market (radioactive quackery).

The Network concealed their identities by using accents and wearing masks. They frequently released press statements denouncing Green Day. Money Money 2020 was re-mastered and re-released by Reprise Records on November 9, 2004, with two additional tracks, \\"Hammer of the Gods\\" and a cover of The Misfits \\"Teenagers from Mars\\" which can also be heard on Tony Hawk's American Wasteland while \\"Roshambo\\" is on the NHL 2005 soundtrack. The original Money Money 2020 release came with a companion DVD with music videos directed and produced by Roy Miles of AntiDivision. In October 2005, the group opened for Green Day for several shows. After this, they became inactive. =Identities= At the time, Armstrong denied the involvement of any Green Day members in The Network, saying \\"All I gotta say is fuck The Network. These guys are totally spreading rumors.\\" However, the three members of Green Day are cited as songwriters for Money Money 2020 by the group's publisher. Additionally, several journalists noted the band's vocals were unmistakably that of Armstrong. In a 2013 interview, bassist Mike Dirnt finally revealed that the group was in fact Green Day, mentioning that Money Money 2020 was worked upon alongside other Green Day projects in the mid-00's.

Capital Transport Publishing, 2000. Despite its name, it is not in the local area historically known as North Greenwich, on the Isle of Dogs, north of the River Thames; a completely different North Greenwich station used to be there, from 1872 until 1926. It is actually closer to Charlton than to Greenwich; however, it is at the northernmost tip of the Royal Borough of Greenwich, which perhaps provides the best explanation of the name. The tube station opened on 14 May 1999. It is adjacent to The O2 (formerly the Millennium Dome) at the northern end of the Greenwich Peninsula, on the south bank of the Thames. It is the easternmost below ground station on the line. It lies between and on the Jubilee line, in Travelcard Zone 2 and Zone 3. History An Underground station was first proposed for the Greenwich Peninsula in a government report on the redevelopment of London's Docklands published in 1973. The proposal, part of the then unbuilt Fleet line, proposed a line running from Charing Cross via Fenchurch Street to Beckton, with stations on each side at Millwall and Custom House. The proposal was developed during the 1970s as the Fleet line developed into the Jubilee line. The route was approved in 1980, but financial constraints meant that the route was not proceeded with. By the start of the 1990s new plans had been developed to extend the Jubilee line on a route south of the River Thames towards Stratford with North Greenwich station built in accordance with this plan. Opened on 14 May 1999, North Greenwich is one of the largest stations on the Jubilee line, capable of handling around 20,000 passengers an hour, having been designed to cope with the large number of visitors expected at the Millennium Dome (now The O2). The track at North Greenwich was designed to facilitate a branch of the line from this station. A branch towards Thamesmead was planned; however this has not been developed beyond the initial proposal, and is not currently in Transport for London's investment programme. The track layout allows trains from both Stanmore and Stratford to terminate at North Greenwich. A number of trains from Stanmore terminate here during peak and off-peak times, and enter platform 2 instead of the usual platform 3. Trains head back towards central London from platform 2. During times of disruption and engineering work, trains from and back to Stratford can be routed into and out of platform 2. Platform 2 at North Greenwich The striking blue-tiled and glazed interior, with raking concrete columns rearing up inside the huge underground space, was designed by the architectural practice Alsop, Lyall and St√∂rmer. The blue tiles on walls were inspired by the design of MTR stations in Hong Kong, where every station adopts a livery in order to help passengers to recognise their alighting stop.Kenneth Powell Jubilee Line Extension, Laurence King Publishing, 2000. As with other stations on the Jubilee Line Extension, all platforms are equipped with platform screen doors. On 20 October 2016, police conducted a controlled explosion on an improvised explosive device at North Greenwich after a passenger spotted an unattended bag filled with \\"wires and an alarm clock\\" aboard a Jubilee line train. No injuries were reported, and a suspect was later detained. The man, Damon Smith, was convicted of possession of an explosive substance with intent and was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. Connections The bus station is interconnected and above the tube station on the surface for direct transfer with London Buses routes 108, 129, 132, 161, 188, 422, 472 and 486 serving the station. The Emirates Air Line cable car opened nearby on 28 June 2012, providing a link between the Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Victoria Dock and ExCeL London.

Internationally known for his work with Muhammad Ali (1960‚Äì1981), he also worked with 15 other world boxing champions, including Sugar Ray Leonard, Jos√© N√°poles, George Foreman, George Scott, Jimmy Ellis, Carmen Basilio, Luis Manuel Rodr√≠guez, and Willie Pastrano. Early life Dundee was born Angelo Mirena on 30 August 1921 in Philadelphia, to Italian recent immigrant parents Filomena Cianelli, mother of seven children, and Angelo Merenda, a railway construction worker, an Italian native from Roggiano Gravina. The name of the father was erroneously transcribed in Mirena at the time of immigration. In the early 1940s he changed his surname to 'Dundee', after the United States champion boxer Johnny Dundee. During World War 2 he served as an aircraft mechanic in the United States Air Force, including an active service deployment to England in 1944-45. His first experience of cornerman work was in U.S.A.F. boxing tournaments, and after leaving the Air Force in late 1945 at the war's end he headed to New York City where he was employed as a bucket-guy at Stillman's Gym as an apprenticeship as a boxing trainer.Obituary for Dundee, 'Daily Telegraph' 2 February 2012. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/sport- obituaries/9056657/Angelo-Dundee.html Boxing trainer career After completing his apprenticeship in New York City, Dundee relocated to Miami Beach, Florida, where he opened the ‚ÄúFifth Street Gym‚Äù with his brother. Carmen Basilio was the first World Champion for whom Dundee acted as a cornerman, when Basilio defeated Tony DeMarco for the world welterweight crown in 1955, and Sugar Ray Robinson for the World Middleweight Crown in 1957. =Career with Muhammad Ali= Dundee with Muhammad Ali and his wife Lonnie, 2000 Dundee traveled around the world with Ali, and he was the cornerman in all but two of Ali's fights (Tunney Hunsaker in 1960 and Jimmy Ellis in 1971). Dundee trained the young Cassius Clay, as Ali was then known, in most of his early bouts, including those with Archie Moore (who had trained Clay before his partnering with Dundee) and Sonny Liston, where Clay won the heavyweight title. Dundee continued to train Ali in all of his fights until his exile from boxing, and upon Ali's return to the sport Dundee trained him in almost all of his fights, including Ali's famed bouts with fighters such as Jerry Quarry, Oscar Bonavena, Joe Frazier, Floyd Patterson, George Foreman, Ken Norton and, later, Leon Spinks. One exception was in Ali's 1971 fight with Jimmy Ellis, where Dundee was in Ellis's corner. Ali knocked Ellis out in the 12th round. Dundee was accused by Foreman of loosening the ring ropes before his 1974 The Rumble in the Jungle fight with Ali to help Ali win the fight by using the rope-a-dope technique. Dundee consistently denied tampering with the ropes. In 1998, after decades, Dundee reunited with Muhammad Ali and appeared alongside him in a sentimental Super Bowl commercial. The two men were friends until Dundee's death and the veteran trainer would always refer to Ali as \\"my kid\\". =Other work= Dundee saw a future emerging star in Sugar Ray Leonard, whom he called \\"a smaller version of Ali\\". Dundee acted as cornerman for Leonard in many of his biggest fights, including those with Wilfred Ben√≠tez, Roberto Dur√°n, Thomas Hearns, and Marvin Hagler. In Leonard's first bout with Hearns, Dundee, thinking that his prot√©g√© was behind on the scorecards, quipped the now famous words, \\"You're blowing it, son! You're blowing it!\\" before the start of round 13. Leonard went on to score a fourteenth round win when the referee stopped the fight. Dundee frequently went to other matches during his career to scout other boxers. During the first Joe Frazier vs. George Foreman bout in Kingston, Jamaica, on January 22, 1973, he sat near Howard Cosell, who was recording a call for ABC for a tape delay re-broadcast. He was overheard on the call noting that Frazier had been hurt before he was knocked down by Foreman the first time in the first round; Cosell mentioned it immediately before his famous \\"Down goes Frazier!\\" call. Later in the bout, Dundee was overheard pleading for the fight to be stopped as Frazier was repeatedly knocked down. The fight was finally stopped after Frazier was knocked down for the sixth time, with Foreman winning the bout‚Äîand the lineal World Heavyweight Championship‚Äîby technical knockout. He later teamed up with George Foreman, including his 1991 Heavyweight title fight against Evander Holyfield and his 1994 Heavyweight title win against then-undefeated Michael Moorer. In addition, Dundee also trained world champions Luis Rodriguez, Willie Pastrano, Ralph Dupas, Jos√© N√°poles, Pinklon Thomas, Trevor Berbick, Jimmy Ellis, Wilfredo G√≥mez, Michael Nunn and Sugar Ramos, as well as other boxers including Bill Bossio, David Estrada, Douglas Vaillant, Jimmy Lange, Tom Zbikowski, Troy Darrell, Adilson Rodrigues, James Tillis, and Pat O'Connor. Retirement In 2005, Dundee was hired to train Russell Crowe for Crowe's characterization of James J. Braddock in Cinderella Man. To that end, Dundee traveled to Australia to work with the Oscar-winning actor and appeared in the film as \\"Angelo\\" the corner man. Throughout his career, Dundee was widely respected as a decent, honorable man in an often corrupt sport. Perhaps the greatest tribute to Dundee was paid by Howard Cosell who said \\"If I had a son who wanted to be a fighter and I couldn't talk him out of it, the only man I would let train him is Angelo Dundee\\". In November 2008, he was hired as a special consultant for Oscar De La Hoya's fight with Manny Pacquiao. Death Dundee died peacefully in his sleep at his senior resident apartment at the age of 90 on February 1, 2012, in Tampa, Florida. A funeral was held on 10 February 2012 at the Countryside Christian Center in Clearwater, Florida, attended by a crowd of several hundred mourners, among them Muhammad Ali.'Ali attends Angelo Dundee funeral', 'espn.com', 11 February 2012. https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/7563237/muhammad-ali-hundreds-attend- angelo-dundee-funeral Dundee's body was buried in Sylvan Abbey Memorial Park cemetery in Clearwater, Florida.Entry for Dundee in Findagrave website (2019). https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/84345542/angelo-dundee Honors Dundee was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1992.

The station is in the Maze Hill area of Greenwich, and is the closest station to Greenwich Park, being about 150m east of the north-east corner of the park. It is down the line from London Bridge. History Maze Hill station opened in 1873 by the South Eastern Railway (SER) and for five years functioned as a terminus on a line linked to the North Kent Line just west of Charlton. On 1 February 1878 a cut-and-cover tunnel link between Greenwich and Maze Hill was opened, completing a through line from the original London and Greenwich Railway to the North Kent Line.http://rail.felgall.com/ser.htm SER Lines and Stationshttp://www.greenwich-guide.org.uk/february.htm#1 Greenwich Guide In 1899 the SER handed over its operations to a new organisation co-owned with the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR), which traded as the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR); the line and station continued to be owned and maintained by the SER. In the 1923 Grouping, the SER and LCDR amalgamated with other railways to form the Southern Railway (SR). Three years later in 1926 the line through Maze Hill was electrified using the 750 V DC third rail system. A limited electric service started on 10 May with a full electric service being operated from 19 July. In 1948 following nationalisation the station became part of British Railways (Southern Region). On 4 July 1958 there was a collision between two trains at Maze Hill. The 09.41 electric passenger train from Gravesend Central to Charing Cross ran past the Up Home signal at danger and collided head-on with a nine-coach empty steam passenger stock train which was being shunted slowly from the Up Sidings across the Up line towards the Down line. The accident occurred as the empty train was entering the crossover leading from the Up to the Down line. The passenger train was approaching the station at about 40 mph when the motorman (driver), who had failed to observe the home signal, saw the obstruction ahead and applied the brakes. His action was too late to be effective and the collision occurred at a speed of about 25 mph. Forty-three people were injured although none seriously. Following a fire, the station was rebuilt with a glass-walled booking hall as a prototype for the rebuilding of similar Southern suburban stations. The new building was opened by the Mayor of Greenwich on 14 July 1972. In 1982 following the establishment of three passenger business sectors, Maze Hill was part of the London & South Eastern business sector which became Network SouthEast in 1986. Following the privatisation of British Rail in 1994 operation of the infrastructure became the responsibility of Railtrack, whilst passenger services were operated by Connex South Eastern. In 2003 the Strategic Rail Authority terminated the Connex franchise and for the next three years the train service was run by a state owned company South Eastern Trains. Operation then transferred to Southeastern on 1 April 2006 and they are currently (in 2014) contracted to run trains until June 2018.Department for Transport announces integrated Kent franchise - Publications - Department for Transport Following financial problems Network Rail took over operation of the infrastructure in 2002. In April 2002 the station was the scene of a fight between Charlton Athletic and Southampton football hooligans that became known as The Battle of Maze Hill.  Location  The station lies at the eastern end of a tunnel underneath the grounds of the National Maritime Museum - itself only a 5- to 10-minute walk away through the park.

The northern portal lies just south of the East India Dock Road (A13) in Blackwall; the southern entrances are just south of The O2 on the Greenwich Peninsula. The road is managed by Transport for London (TfL). The tunnel was originally opened as a single bore in 1897 by the then Prince of Wales, as a major transport project to improve commerce and trade in London's East End, and supported a mix of foot, cycle, horse-drawn and vehicular traffic. By the 1930s, capacity was becoming inadequate, and consequently a second bore opened in 1967, handling southbound traffic while the earlier 19th century tunnel handles northbound. The northern approach takes traffic from the A12 and the southern approach takes traffic from the A2, making the tunnel crossing a key link for both local and longer-distance traffic between the north and south sides of the river. It forms part of a key route into Central London from South East London and Kent and was the easternmost all-day crossing for vehicles before the opening of the Dartford Tunnel in 1963. It remains the easternmost free fixed road crossing of the Thames, and regularly suffers congestion, to the extent that tidal flow schemes were in place from 1978 until controversially removed in 2007. Given the very high traffic volumes at the crossing (and the height restrictions of the Victorian bore) the crossing is being supplemented by the Silvertown Tunnel, currently under construction. When the Silvertown Tunnel is completed in 2025, both it and the Blackwall Tunnels will be tolled. The tunnels are no longer open to pedestrians, cyclists or other non-motorised traffic, and the northbound tunnel has a height limit. The London Buses route 108 between Lewisham and Stratford runs through the tunnels. History =Old tunnel= A framing section of the Blackwall Tunnel being constructed at the Thames Ironworks around 1895 A tunnel in the Blackwall area was originally proposed in the 1880s. According to Robert Webster, then MP for St Pancras East, a tunnel would \\"be very useful to the East End of London, a district representing in trade and commerce a population greater than the combined populations of Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham.\\" By this time, all road bridges in London east of the ferry at Chiswick were toll-free, but these were of little use to the two fifths of London's population that lived to the east of London Bridge. The Thames Tunnel (Blackwall) Act was created in August 1887, which provided the legal framework necessary to construct the tunnel. The initial proposal, made by Sir Joseph Bazalgette, called for three parallel tunnels, two for vehicular traffic and one for foot, with an expected completion date of works within seven years. It was originally commissioned by the Metropolitan Board of Works but, just before the contract was due to start, responsibility passed to the London County Council (LCC) when the former body was abolished in 1889 and Bazalgette's work on the tunnel ended. The entrance to the tunnel in 1899, when it was still a single bore The original tunnel as built was designed by Sir Alexander Binnie and built by S. Pearson & Sons, between 1892 and 1897, for whom Ernest William Moir was the lead engineer. It was constructed using a Greathead tunnelling shield and compressed air techniques (named after its inventor, James Henry Greathead). It was lit by three rows of incandescent street lights. To clear the site in Greenwich, more than 600 people had to be rehoused, and a house reputedly once owned by Sir Walter Raleigh had to be demolished. The work force was largely drawn from immigrants; the tunnel lining was manufactured in Glasgow, while the manual labour came from provincial England, particularly Yorkshire. The tunnel was officially opened by the Prince of Wales on 22 May 1897. The total cost of the tunnel was ¬£1.4 M and 800 men were employed in its construction, during which seven deaths were recorded. The southern entrance gateway to the tunnel, also known as Southern Tunnel House, was designed by LCC architect Thomas Blashill and was built just before the tunnel was completed. It comprises two floors with an attic. Today the western bore is only used for northbound traffic and is not accessible to vehicles taller than . The tunnel has several sharp bends, in order that the tunnel could align with Northumberland Wharf to the north and Ordnance Wharf to the south, and avoid a sewer underneath Bedford Street. Some sources state an additional purpose was to prevent horses from bolting once they saw daylight. The tunnel carries two lanes of traffic, though higher vehicles need to keep to the left-hand lane so that they do not hit the tunnel's inner lining. =New tunnel= The northern ventilation towers for the new Blackwall tunnel, February 2006 Due to the increase in motor traffic in the early 20th century, the capacity of the original tunnel was soon perceived as inadequate. In 1930, John Mills, MP for Dartford, remarked that HGVs delivering from Essex to Kent could not practically use any crossing of the Thames downstream of the tunnel. The LCC obtained an act to construct a new tunnel in 1938, but work did not start due to the outbreak of World War II. Construction eventually started in 1958 with preliminary work on the northern approach road. By this time, traffic had become progressively worse. In 1960, Richard Marsh, MP for Greenwich complained that vehicles could spend 30 to 45 minutes stuck in tunnel traffic. The new eastern tunnel, in diameter, was accepted into the roads programme in March 1959, and construction started in March 1960. It was opened on 2 August 1967 by Desmond Plummer, Leader of the Greater London Council (GLC). It is wider than the western tunnel, carries two lanes of traffic and is usable by vehicles up to in height. During construction, transport minister Ernest Marples clarified that unlike the Dartford Tunnel, also then under construction, tolls would not be imposed as the tunnel was already an established route. At the time of opening, the strip lighting in the tunnel was commended as \\"a big improvement\\" on the standard provided in the original tunnel. In contrast with the Victorian northbound tunnel, the eastern tunnel had no sharp bends, and emergency telephones were provided. Its distinctive ventilation towers were designed in 1964 by GLC architect Terry Farrell. Immediately after opening, the old tunnel was closed for refurbishment. It re- opened on 4 April 1969 with a new electronic system to detect overheight vehicles. In the late 1960s, proposals were made to connect the tunnel with a free-flow, grade-separated motorway system as part of the London Ringways project. Aside from the construction of the A102(M) Blackwall Tunnel approach roads, opened in 1973, these plans were abandoned. The entrance gateway to the northbound tunnel was Grade II listed in 1973, while the ventilation towers were listed in 2000. In April 1986, the tunnel became part of the UK trunk road network. It was detrunked and control handed to TfL in September 1999. =Provisional IRA bombing= On 18 January 1979, an anonymous caller to the Press Association informed them that the Provisional IRA had planted a bomb in the tunnel that was scheduled to detonate at midnight. While the Metropolitan Police were searching the tunnel, the bomb detonated at 12:40 a.m., causing an explosion in a gas holder near the southern exit. This resulted in a fire on another gas holder approximately an hour later. No injuries were reported. Speaking in the House of Commons, Home Secretary Merlyn Rees hoped \\"the House will join me in condemning these attacks and will support the Government in their determination not to be swayed by such methods\\". A Belfast man was jailed for 17 years in May 1983 for his role in the bombing. Nearest alternative crossings TfL state that one of the major issues with the Blackwall Tunnels is the lack of resilience in the event of an incident‚Äîas the nearest alternative road crossings are the Rotherhithe Tunnel to the west, Tower Bridge to the west, and the Dartford Crossing to the east. The Woolwich Free Ferry is to the east, but is closed overnight, often reduced to one boat in operation, or completely closed at weekends. Variable message signs (VMS) near the tunnel inform drivers if the ferry is available. When open, queuing for the ferry causes significant congestion around Woolwich town centre. Underground railway links include the Jubilee line from North Greenwich (TfL) to Canning Town on the east and Canary Wharf on the west. The Docklands Light Railway also passes under the Thames between Island Gardens at the southern end of the Isle of Dogs and Cutty Sark in the centre of Greenwich. Horse-drawn traffic was partially banned from the tunnel during peak hours in July 1939 and completely banned in August 1947. Pedestrians have been banned from using the Blackwall Tunnels since May 1969. The London Buses route 108 (Stratford‚ÄìLewisham) runs through the tunnels and there are bus priority gates at both entrances to allow buses to avoid traffic congestion. On occasion in the past, the bus service has been escorted through the tunnel when it has been closed. Traffic management The northbound Blackwall Tunnel is a traffic bottleneck with tailbacks. A TfL study in 2009 revealed that the approach to the northbound tunnel took around 19 minutes in rush hour traffic, or a delay of approximately 11 minutes per kilometre. To relieve the congestion, a tidal flow system was introduced in 1978, allowing northbound traffic to use the western lane of the eastern tunnel. The congestion is not limited to weekday rush hours. There is often congestion with tailbacks at the weekends, especially on Sunday evenings. Due to its sharp turns with restricted headroom, high-sided vehicles can only use the left-hand lane of the western tunnel, so it was not possible to reverse the tidal flow in the evening. In April 2007, the morning tidal flow was discontinued, after reports by TfL and the Metropolitan Police (MPS) of an increase in dangerous motoring behaviour; these blamed poor driving, such as overtaking, for the decrease in safety during counterflow operations. The decision to end the counterflow was controversial, particularly as TfL and the MPS had been considering it since 2005, without properly informing affected borough councils, and an independent committee was set up to evaluate the decision. The ending of the counterflow system has brought protests from users of the tunnel and those experiencing increased congestion due to the change. In November 2007, the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone responded to complaints from Greenwich Council about congestion in the area, with the possibility of setting up a small congestion charging zone. He clarified that this would not extend to the Blackwall Tunnel, stating \\"I have given that commitment right the way through my period as Mayor, and there cannot be anything that impacts on the A2 because the impact then on Lewisham is unacceptable.\\" In 2012, TfL announced their intention to toll the tunnels to pay for the Silvertown Link crossing, suggesting it was the \\"most appropriate way\\". Responding to this, Paul Watters from the AA said \\"We‚Äôve already seen the Western extension of the congestion charge dropped because it was hugely unpopular and I think tolling on the Blackwall Tunnel will be as controversial as that.\\" In June 2013, TfL announced they would send registration details of any broken-down or over- height commercial vehicle in the tunnel to the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA), and set up a new automatic recognition system to detect unsuitable heavy goods vehicles heading towards it. TfL commissioner Sir Peter Hendy said that \\"this partnership working will help improve traffic flow on one of the busiest routes in the capital.\\" Maintenance and closures Southern Tunnel House, at the southern entrance to the tunnel. The gateway house is now Grade II listed. The Blackwall Tunnel has attracted criticism in the past for its perceived lack of safety. In 2002, a survey by major motoring organisations rated the tunnel's safety record as \\"very poor\\", and concluded it was one of the least safe tunnels in Europe. In 2010, the northbound tunnel was refurbished in order to meet current safety standards. Fire detection systems have been installed in response to new European regulations in the light of recent tunnel fires. In 2010, the southbound tunnel was affected by planned closures for maintenance from 10 pm to 5 am, Thursday to Sunday inclusive, and over a number of whole weekends. The tunnel was only closed six full weekends instead of the planned ten. The tunnel also suffers regular problems with strikes from over-height traffic, and vehicles running out of fuel. On 10 December 1996, a man drove a Mercedes truck supporting a crane towards the southbound tunnel, ignored warnings that his vehicle was over- height, and struck a gantry, breaking a steel reinforcement frame in the process. The entire tunnel was immediately closed, not only to retrieve the vehicle, but to perform additional safety checks. Because the Limehouse Link tunnel, which runs near to the north end of the Blackwall Tunnel, and the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, part of the Dartford Crossing, were also closed on the same day, the accident caused one of the worst traffic jams in the capital. In February 2011, TfL reported that the tunnel had been closed 1,200 times in the previous year for a total of 157 hours, while New Civil Engineer magazine claimed it shut 1,448 times in 2010. To try to prevent closures of this nature, an LED noticeboard was set up in the northbound approach, counting the number of breakdowns and accidents per month occurring inside the tunnel. During the 2010s the tunnel has been closed to motor traffic to provide cyclists access to the RideLondon event, although this arrangement is no longer in place. Future Map of the planned route of the Silvertown Tunnel The Blackwall Tunnel is the only major road crossing of the Thames in East London, and consequently has very high traffic volumes. Furthermore, the limitations of the western bore of the tunnel (not accessible to vehicles taller than ), means that larger HGV and double decker buses cannot pass through the tunnel in both directions. Given this, an expansion of the crossing has been proposed for many years‚Äîsuch as a third bore of the tunnel, proposed in 1989‚Äîhowever none of these proposals have come to fruition. Following the cancellation of the Thames Gateway Bridge in 2008, a new crossing from the Greenwich Peninsula to Silvertown‚Äîthe Silvertown Tunnel‚Äîwas proposed by TfL. Following a public inquiry, the government approved the proposal in May 2018, and the contract to build the tunnel was awarded in November 2019. The Silvertown Tunnel will have two tunnels, one for each direction‚Äîwith a dedicated HGV and bus lane. This will allow a substantial increase in cross-river bus services, as the new tunnel will be able to be used by double decker buses. Following completion of the new crossing in around 2025, both the Silvertown and Blackwall tunnels will be tolled.

It was formally opened in 1908 by George, Prince of Wales (later King George V), and Richard Robinson, Chairman of the London County Council. It is an extremely rare example of a road tunnel where road traffic, pedestrians and cyclists all share the same tunnel bore. Transport for London took over ownership and maintenance of the tunnel in 2001. It should not be confused with the nearby earlier more historic Thames Tunnel, designed and built under the supervision of Marc Isambard Brunel and his son Isambard Kingdom Brunel, used by London Overground for the East London Line. Construction Following the success of the Blackwall Tunnel, opened in 1897, the London County Council decided to construct another toll-free road crossing of the River Thames located in heart of the then flourishing London Docks, midway between Tower Bridge and Blackwall Tunnel. When originally opened the route served the Surrey Commercial Docks (since closed) on the south side and Limehouse and West India Docks (since closed) on the north side. This was authorised by the Thames Tunnel (Rotherhithe and Ratcliff) Act 1900. Designed by Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice, the Engineer for LCC it copied closely the Blackwall Tunnel; however it is of larger diameter. At the time of its construction, the tunnel was said to be \\"the largest subaqueous tunnel in existence\\".Henry Jephson, The Making of Modern London: progress & reaction: twenty-one years of the London County council, p. 62. (The London Liberal Federation, 1910) As the area either side of the river was already developed, to construct the tunnel, especially the long approach ramps required nearly 3,000 local residents to be displaced. This generated considerable local opposition which resulted in the LCC constructing in 1903 new tenement blocks in Swan Lane (now Swan Road), Clarence Street and Albion Street in Rotherhithe and Brightlingsea Buildings on Ropemaker's Field in Limehouse. The new blocks had more modern facilities but the rents charged were significantly higher than they had been paying and many soon moved out of the area. The work took place between 1904 and 1908, executed by resident engineer Edward H. Tabor and contractors Price and Reeves, at a cost of about ¬£1 million (equivalent to around ¬£ in ). The tunnel was excavated partly using a tunnelling shield and partly by cut-and-cover. Two tunnelling shields were employed, the first was used in the very challenging and difficult ground conditions encountered on the south side and under river sections, whilst a second lighter, shorter shield was employed on the north side where the ground conditions are better. The first shield was only able to be steered in a straight line, whilst the second one could be steered through gentle curves. The tunnelling was constructed under compressed air and the river-bed lined with puddle clay. The extensive precautions undertaken during its construction meant that none of the workforce were killed, a rarity at that time for a project of this size and complexity. The entrance arches have been formed from cutting edges from the second tunnelling shield, which measured in diameter,Rolt Hammond, Civil Engineering Plant and Methods, p. 150. (Benn, 1952) forming in effect a loading gauge for the tunnel. Physical characteristics Sectional map of the Rotherhithe Tunnel, 1906 The tunnel consists of a single bore, long, carrying a two-lane carriageway below the high-water level of the Thames, with a maximum depth of below the surface. Four shafts were sunk alongside the tunnel to aid construction, later ventilation and entrance shafts. The shafts are numbered 1 to 4, south to north. Shaft 1 is located on the corner of Brunel Road and Canon Beck Road in Rotherhithe. It contains ventilation fans that supply fresh air to the tunnel. It is a single storey circular redbrick building, originally constructed without a roof. It now has a high roof containing three large vents. Also within the shaft is a floodgate dating from 1939 which protects the nearby London Overground. Shaft 2 is located along the river front close to Rotherhithe Street Bascule Bridge on the south side of the river. Shaft 3 is the corresponding shaft on the north side located by the river in King Edward VII Memorial Park. They are both single storey circular redbrick buildings with ornate ironwork grilles in the large side openings and granite dressings. Each contain an iron spiral staircases that were originally pedestrian access points but were closed in the 1970s due to low usage and security concerns. The shaft buildings were originally capped with a dome glass roof (similar to that at Greenwich Foot Tunnel) however these were removed in the 1930s in a bid to improve ventilation within the tunnel. New roofs were not added until 2007 to a different design. The staircases being open to the elements for more than 70 years had suffered extensive corrosion and were fully refurbished the same year. The shaft buildings and staircases for these two shafts were Grade II heritage listed in 1983. Both shafts contain ventilation fans which are primarily used to extract foul air from the tunnel however the low height of these shaft buildings prevents efficient dilution and dispersal of pollutants. Shaft 4 is located on the corner of The Highway and Heckford Street. The original redbrick circular building was demolished in 1967 to allow widening of The Highway to four lanes which now extends over half the shaft. A plain surface building was constructed to house the fresh air supply fans. Pedestrian access to the tunnel is now limited to the portals; however there are granite staircases topped with ornate lighting columns close to each portal as an alternative to the footpaths on the approach ramps. The tunnel is entered via a sloping brick-lined cutting at each end leading to the entrance portal. Both portals are faced with pink granite and were given Grade II heritage listing in 1983. On the Rotherhithe side (south side) the approach road spans over the platforms of Rotherhithe London Overground station. It was originally planned the tunnel would commence before the railway was reached however during construction this was changed to be north of this instead thus shortening the tunnel by . It is followed by a short cut-and-cover section until the first of the four shafts is reached. The tunnelled section is between shafts 1 and 4, measures long and is lined with cast iron segments.Denis Smith, London and the Thames Valley, p. 17. (Thomas Telford, 2000) The tunnel bore was sized to the maximum that the technology of the time allowed. Even then it was recognised this would result in less than ideal lane widths with each lane only in width (modern equivalent road width is ) and footways typically wide on each side of the roadway. The tunnel is shallow, with a maximum gradient of 1 in 36 (2.8%), to cater for non- mechanised traffic. It includes sharp bends at the location of the shafts. This allowed the sections between the shafts to be straight, thus reducing the complexity of construction and avoiding the foundations of the docks. An urban myth is that the bends were installed to prevent horses from seeing daylight at the end of the tunnel too early, which might make them bolt for the exit. The sharp bends and narrow lanes do however make the tunnel unsuitable for large vehicles and as a consequence are banned from the tunnel. The speed limit is and is enforced using average speed cameras. The tunnel bore was originally lined throughout with white glazed tiles, installed by two separate contractors, Boote's installed the tiling for north half and Edwards for the south. A band of brown tiles at the centre point of the tunnel demarcated the boundary. After repeated failures of the tiling in the southern half, these were removed in 2011 and replaced with a sprayed gunite surface, detracting significantly the look and feel of the tunnel. The shafts are lined with white glazed bricks, Shaw's installing them for shafts 3 and 4 on the north side and Stourbridge for shafts 1 and 2 on the south side. White glazed brickwork is used externally on the approach roads. A 2003 survey rated the tunnel the tenth most dangerous tunnel in Europe due to its poor safety features.\\"UK's 'dangerous' road tunnels\\", BBC News Online, 24 April 2003 Its proximity to the river also makes it vulnerable to flooding, as happened in the 1928 Thames flood.\\"The South Side. Damage In Tooleystreet Area.\\" The Times, 9 January 1928 Usage The southern tunnel portal. Like many other London tunnels and bridges, the tunnel carries far more traffic than it was designed for. Shortly after opening 2,600 vehicles a day, mostly horse-drawn, and 14,000 pedestrians a day soon were using the tunnel ‚Äî figures which were seen as easily justifying the expense of its construction. By 1955, usage had quadrupled to 10,500 vehicles a day\\"Rotherhithe Tunnel Jubilee\\", P.L.A. Monthly, Port of London 1955 and by 1997 usage had tripled again, to over 34,000 vehicles a day. The heavy usage, particularly during rush hours, can lead to significant congestion and tailbacks. The junctions at either side of the tunnel are the constraints to any further growth therefore current traffic levels have remained at 1997 levels. Pedestrian numbers are now very low at around 20 per day, whilst cyclists number between 150 and 200 per day. With the launch of the Ford Model T car only months after the tunnel opened, initiating a rapid increase in car ownership, by the late 1920s motor vehicles had all but replaced horse-drawn vehicles, which were eventually banned altogether in 1952. The original ventilation system consisted of two fans supplying fresh air in each of shafts 1 and 4 to a duct below the roadway which in turn feed via 28 grilles spaced evenly along the road into the tunnel. Following several incidents, including one where 49 people were taken to hospital, in 1930 the ventilation was upgraded, more powerful fans were added and extract fans added in shafts 2 and 3. As traffic has increased, periodically the ventilation fans have been upgraded however the underlying concept has remained the same. Alternative crossings include Tower Bridge to the west or the Greenwich foot tunnel to the east. Rotherhithe station is almost adjacent to the southern tunnel entrance, and Limehouse (in Ratcliffe Lane) is the closest station to the northern entrance. Local buses used to serve the tunnel in the past. Route 82 ran between Stepney East Station (now Limehouse) and St. Marychurch Street in Rotherhithe, before being withdrawn in 1968. The tunnel remained unserved until route P14 commenced in 1988 from Surrey Quays and the Isle of Dogs. This route was withdrawn and partially replaced by a new 395 route in 1999 running from Limehouse (Burdett Road) instead of the Isle of Dogs. The 395 route was withdrawn without replacement on 28 April 2006, due to high running costs and low passenger usage. By this time it was the only Transport for London bus route that still used mini-buses, which were necessary due to the tunnel's width restriction.http://www.londonbuses.co.uk/routes/082-1.html The opening credits of the 1970s TV series The Professionals feature the Rotherhithe Tunnel whilst the 1951 film Pool of London features a police chase scene in the tunnel and shoot-out up and around the shafts. The video for The Specials' song \\"Ghost Town\\" was partially filmed in the tunnel.

Design and construction Entrance to the Greenwich foot tunnel, southern side, with a view of Canary Wharf The tunnel was designed by civil engineer Sir Alexander Binnie for London County Council and constructed by contractor John Cochrane & Co. The project started in June 1899 and the tunnel opened on 4 August 1902. The tunnel replaced an expensive and sometimes unreliable ferry service allowing workers living south of the Thames to reach their workplaces in the London docks and shipyards in or near the Isle of Dogs. Its creation owed much to the efforts of working-class politician Will Crooks, who had worked in the docks and, after chairing the LCC's Bridges Committee responsible for the tunnel, later served as Labour MP for Woolwich. The section of the tunnel that was repaired following damage during World War II The entrance shafts at both ends are beneath glazed domes. Lifts, installed in 1904, were upgraded in 1992 and again in 2012, and helical staircases allow pedestrians to access the sloping, tile-lined tunnel. The cast-iron tunnel is long, deep and has an internal diameter of about . The cast-iron rings are coated with concrete and surfaced with some 200,000 white glazed tiles. The northern end was damaged by bombs during the Second World War and repairs included a thick steel and concrete inner lining that reduces the diameter substantially for a short distance. The North tower has 87 steps, and the South tower has 100. Location The tunnel links * Greenwich town centre on the south bank of the Thames. Its entrance is close to the restored clipper Cutty Sark. with * parts of Docklands including Canary Wharf on the north bank. The tunnel's northern entrance is at Island Gardens, a park on the southern tip of the Isle of Dogs, with views across the river to the former Greenwich Hospital, the Queen's House and the Royal Greenwich Observatory. Because of its depth and location, the tunnel remains cool even on hot days. Usage A notice at the tunnel entrance states that the tunnel is private property and not a public right of way. Ordnance Survey maps do not show a right of way on the route of the tunnel. The tunnel is accessible by spiral staircases and large lifts that were refurbished between 2010 and 2012. The tunnel is also part of the UK's National Cycle Route 1 linking Inverness and Dover. As of October 2017, cyclists are required to dismount and push their bikes through the tunnel although plans to remove this requirement have been considered. A National Trail, the Thames Path, uses the tunnel to rejoin the southbound part of the path. A 2016 survey showed that around 4,000 people use the tunnel each day. Upgrade works Before recent renovations, the attendant-operated lift service was only open from 7 am to 7 pm on weekdays and Saturdays, and 10 am to 5.30 pm on Sundays, with no service on Christmas Day or Boxing Day. Staff shortages and other problems meant that even during these times the lifts were often unavailable. Since 1999, if the lift was not functioning, anyone unable to use the stairs could take the Docklands Light Railway between Island Gardens DLR station (close to the northern end of the tunnel) and Cutty Sark DLR station, close to the southern end. However, non-folding bicycles are not permitted on the Docklands Light Railway system at peak times. The tunnel in 2017 Greenwich Council started work to upgrade the tunnel on 19 April 2010, intending to reduce leakage, improve drainage and install new lifts, CCTV, communication facilities and signage. Completion was planned for March 2011 but this slipped to September 2011. The tunnel was supposed to be accessible throughout most of the renovations, but it closed completely in February 2011. Stair use was soon regained but lifts remained out of service until early 2012, and remained subject to occasional brief closures during 2012. In October 2012 Greenwich Council acknowledged that the upgrade work had not been completed on time and had run over budget. The work was finally completed and included new customer- operated lifts with surface level availability signs, CCTV coverage, upgraded lighting and renewal or replacement of vital structural components. The tunnel in 2018 The 'Friends of Greenwich and Woolwich foot tunnels' (FOGWOFT) was established in September 2013. Following encouragement from FOGWOFT and information from the Institution of Civil Engineers, on 5 July 2016 an interpretative plaque was unveiled near the tunnel's Greenwich entrance by the deputy leader of Royal Borough of Greenwich council. In 2016 the Ethos Active Mobility system was installed in the tunnel to monitor and actively manage tunnel usage. The system uses computer vision to count and measure the speed of bicycles and pedestrians, and displays messages on electronic signs to encourage considerate behaviour. The system has also been installed in the Woolwich foot tunnel and aims to make urban shared spaces safer and more pleasant to use for all. The system displays two messages: \\"No cycling allowed\\" (in red text) during busy periods, and \\"Please consider pedestrians\\" (in green text) during quiet periods. As of March 2017 this system is still in its trial phase, and cycling in the tunnel is still not permitted and will not be until the bylaws are changed. Despite this there are still many who cycle through the tunnel.

One of the Royal Parks of London, and the first to be enclosed (in 1433), it covers , and is part of the Greenwich World Heritage Site. It commands fine views over the River Thames, the Isle of Dogs and the City of London (Simon Jenkins rated the view of the Royal Hospital with Canary Wharf in the distance as one of the top ten in England). The park is open year-round. It is listed Grade I on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. In 2020, it was awarded a National Lottery grant to restore its historic features, build a learning centre, enhance the park's biodiversity, and provide better access for people with disabilities.  History  William Turner Queen Caroline's Bath, Greenwich Park The estate of some was originally owned by the Abbey of St. Peter at Ghent, but reverted to the Crown in 1427 and was given by Henry VI to his uncle Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester.(Barker 1999) He built a house by the river, Bella Court, and a small castle, called Greenwich Castle as well as Duke Humphrey's Tower, on the hill. The former evolved first into the Tudor Palace of Placentia and then into the Queen's House and Greenwich Hospital. Greenwich Castle, by now in disrepair, was chosen for the site of the Royal Observatory by Charles II in 1675. In the 15th century the park was mostly heathland and probably used for hawking. In the next century, deer were introduced by Henry VIII for hunting, and a small collection of deer is maintained today in an area to the south east. James I enclosed the park with a brick wall, twelve feet high and two miles (3 km) long at a cost of ¬£2000, much of which remains and defines the modern boundary. A small section of the boundary wall in the southwest corner of the park was formerly part of Montagu House, one time residence of Caroline of Brunswick, demolished in 1815, though Queen Caroline's bath (c. 1806) is preserved inside the park. In the 17th century, the park was landscaped, possibly by Andr√© Le N√¥tre who is known at least to have designed plans for it. The public were first allowed into the park during the 18th century. Samuel Johnson visited the park in 1763 and commented \\"Is it not fine?\\". The famous hill upon which the observatory stands was used on public holidays for mass 'tumbling'.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/8581929/Greenwich- Fair-Where-Dickens-let-his-hair-down.html In the 1830s a railway was nearly driven through the middle of the lower park on a viaduct but the scheme was defeated by intense local opposition. However, the London and Greenwich Railway was later extended beneath the ground via a cut-and-cover tunnel link between Greenwich and Maze Hill which opened in 1878 (the tunnel alignment is on the north side of the northern side of the park's boundary wall, running beneath the gardens of the National Maritime Museum and Queen's House). In 1888 the park got a station of its own when Greenwich Park railway station was opened. The station was not successful, with most passengers preferring the older Greenwich station, and in 1917 Greenwich Park station and the associated line closed. Greenwich Park was used for outdoor London scenes including representing the street, Constitution Hill in the 2009 film The Young Victoria starring Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend.  Geography  The park is roughly rectangular in plan with sides 1000 metres by 750 metres and oriented with the long sides lying NNW to SSE. In what follows this direction is taken to be N to S for ease of exposition. It is located at grid reference . The park is on two levels with a number of dips and gullies marking the transition between them. The lower level (closest to the Museum, Queen's House and, beyond them, the Thames) lies to the north; from there a steep walk uphill reveals the southern part ‚Äì a flat expanse that is, essentially, an enclosed extension of the plateau of Blackheath. Roughly in the centre, on the top of the hill, is the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. At the northern edge is the National Maritime Museum and Queen's House, and beyond those Greenwich Hospital. To the east is Vanbrugh Castle. To the south is Blackheath and in the south western corner is the Ranger's House, looking out over the heath. To the west lie the architecturally fine streets of Chesterfield Walk and Croom's Hill (Pevsner 1983). Royal Observatory The Royal Observatory The Observatory is on the top of the hill. Outside is a statue of General James Wolfe (buried in St Alfege Church, Greenwich) in a small plaza from which there are majestic views across to the former Greenwich Hospital (the Old Royal Naval College and now the University of Greenwich) and then towards the river, the skyscrapers of Canary Wharf, the City of London to the northwest and the Millennium Dome to the north. Amenities Greenwich Park gates On the lower level of the park there is a popular children's playground (north-east corner, close to Maze Hill railway station) and an adjacent boating lake. There is also a herb garden (close by entrance to Greenwich town centre). On the upper level, there is an extensive flower garden complete with large duck pond, a rose garden, a cricket pitch, many 17th-century sweet chestnut trees with gnarled, swirling trunks, tennis courts, a bandstand, Roman remains, an ancient oak tree (known as Queen Elizabeth's Oak, associated with Queen Elizabeth I) and an enclosure ('The Wilderness') housing some wild deer. Nestling just behind the Observatory is the garden of the former Astronomer Royal, a peaceful secluded space which is good for picnics and also sometimes used by theatre groups (Midsummer Night's Dream, etc.). On the opposite side (i.e., just south of the Wolfe statue) is the Park Caf√©. There is another, smaller caf√© by the north west gate, and a snack bar in the children's playground. It is possible to park (pay and display) in areas along the main roads entering from Blackheath. Cycle routes criss-cross the park (as do runners, roller-bladers, dog-walkers, etc.), but other road traffic (cars and motor-cycles only) can only use the park road linking Blackheath and Greenwich at peak periods on weekdays. Sport During the London 2012 Summer Olympics, Greenwich Park was the venue for the Olympic equestrian events and for the riding and running parts of the modern pentathlon events. It was also the venue for the Paralympic equestrian events. The use of Greenwich Park for Olympic equestrian events caused some tension between the London Organising Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Games 2012 (LOCOG) and some local area residents. A community action group, NOGOE (No to Greenwich Olympic Equestrian Events), believed Greenwich Park was not a suitable venue for the events and started an (ultimately unsuccessful) petition to get the equestrian events relocated; by February 2009 this had gathered over 12,000 signatures. The park also staged the start of the final stage of the 2006 Tour of Britain cycle race (3 September). One of three start points for London Marathon, the 'red start', is located in southern Greenwich Park, close to Charlton Way. The London Half-Marathon, Run to the Beat, passed through the park from 2008 to 2012; in 2013, the last running of the 13.1-mile event started and finished in the park. Be Military Fit runs classes in the park when daylight permits. Gallery Image:GreenwichParkTree GS.jpgOne of the ancient chestnut trees.

It was introduced at the New York International Auto Show in 1958 and featured safety belts as standard, which soon became commonplace on most cars. The GT750 was a sporty version of the Saab 93, mainly aimed at the US market. It had the same body shell as the 93 but used a different interior and a high-output Saab two-stroke engine. Rear- hinged doors were offered on the 1958 model year only. It was not retired from the market with the 93 but received the Saab 96 body and 4-speed gearbox in 1960 and continued in production until 1962. In 1962, it received the even larger engine from the 96, was fitted with front disc brakes and was renamed the GT850. It was called the Saab Sport in the UK and 'Monte Carlo' in the USA (after the successes in the Monte Carlo Rally). The GT had twin carburetors and the two-stroke engine had been tuned to develop 50 hp (37 kW). An optional tuning kit was available to upgrade it to a GT 750R with the engine power boosted to 55 hp (41 kW). The engine gave most power at high revs, 3400 to 5000 rpm. The gearbox had three gears. In order to overcome the problems of overrun for the two-stroke engine, a freewheel device was fitted. A 1959 review by Road & Track commented that smooth upshifts of the widely spaced 3-speed manual required revving the engine over 5000 rpm or slipping the clutch. Saab provided a retrofit kit which leaned out the fuel mixture in the carburettor, making the car more tractable at low revs but seriously impacting performance. The magazine also tried a modified GT with , which improved acceleration to from 15.2 seconds (in the GT) to 12 flat. For comparison, an unmodified 93B required 27.2 seconds. Road & Track praised the car's smooth ride and steering, as well as its high level of equipment. Even a \\"Halda Speedpilot\\", a mechanical analog trip computer of the type used for rally racing, was included in the package.

The film, starring Jesse Jane, Carmen Luvana, Janine Lindemulder, Devon, Jenaveve Jolie, Teagan Presley, and Evan Stone, features many references to the mainstream Hollywood film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. Producer Samantha Lewis stated in an interview that Pirates was the most expensive pornographic film made to date, with a reported budget of well over $1 million. A sequel, Pirates II: Stagnetti's Revenge, was made on an even bigger budget of $8 million, and it is considered the most expensive porn film ever produced. Plot In 1763, Captain Edward Reynolds is hunting pirates, or at least trying to do so. He does not consider himself a great commander, and neither does most of his crew. Only his first officer Jules believes in him. When they save a young woman named Isabella from drowning, she tells them that her husband's ship has been destroyed by the feared Captain Victor Stagnetti and his crew of cutthroat pirates. Reynolds and his crew go hunting for Stagnetti, who tries to find a map that leads to a powerful secret on an island somewhere in the Caribbean Sea. Stagnetti finds the secret \\"staff\\" unlocked by Isabella's husband Manuel. After the crew escapes the spawn of darkness summoned by Stagnetti, their ship engages Stagnetti's in battle, ending Stagnetti's reign as a pirate.

It also included an original music score, later released on a separate soundtrack CD, and was mastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. Several scenes were shot on board the Bounty II, a replica of HMS Bounty, in St. Petersburg, Florida. The owners of the ship were not aware of the true nature of the film as they were advised that the film being made was a \\"Disney-type pirate film for families\\", Alt URL a mistaken notion that would continue in video stores after its release. The film was initially released as a three-disc DVD set (the movie on a standard video DVD, the movie again in a high definition (720P) Windows Media format, and a special features disc) priced as high as $70. An edited R-rated version of the film was released on DVD on July 11, 2006. Digital Playground also released an Original Motion Picture Soundtrack CD, a rarity among adult video releases. The film was also released on Blu-ray Disc (containing only xxx version) and HD DVD as one of the first high-definition adult releases on an optical disc format.  Sequel  Evan Stone reported on the extra DVD that there was going to be a sequel. In January 2007, it was reported that a sequel would be produced, directed by Joone and entitled Pirates II. A first teaser trailer was presented during the 2007 AVN Adult Entertainment Expo in Las Vegas, Nevada.

It measures in the north-south direction with a width of , and has an area of . The highest peak is T√ºrk Tepesi at an altitude of above sea level. It is prohibited to fly over it or fish near its shores. History The Roman authors Pliny the Elder and Strabo called the island Besbicus ().Sir William Smith, ed. Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, vol. 1 (London: John Murray, 1872) p. 395. It was later known as Kalonymos () and Kalolimnos (). In antiquity, it was a member of the Delian League since it appears in tribute records of Athens between 434/3 and 418/7 BCE. The Turkish name ƒ∞mralƒ± derives from the name of the island's conqueror, Emir Ali, one of the first Ottoman admirals. In 1308 ƒ∞mralƒ± became the first island to be conquered by the newly established Ottoman Navy. Its strategic location enabled the Ottomans to control the movement of ships in the Sea of Marmara with a naval base established on it, cutting the Byzantine Empire's connection to Bursa. In 1913 the island had 250 houses, a school, three monasteries, and 1,200 residents, all of whom were Greeks. The economic activity of the island's residents consisted mainly of fishing and farming onions, with most of the grown onions sold to Istanbul. There were three Greek villages on the island until the Turkish War of Independence (1919‚Äì1923), engaged mostly in growing grapes, winemaking, silk production and fishing. The island was mostly uninhabited from the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey until 1935, when a semi-open category prison was built. The prisoners earned money by working in agriculture and fishing. One well-known islander was Kimon Friar who emigrated to the United States and became a scholar and translator of Greek language poetry.American College of Greece There is a military base on the island, and the area around the island is a forbidden zone.

It is licensed and financed by London River Services, the maritime arm of Transport for London (TfL). The service is operated by Briggs Marine under contract to TfL and carries both foot passengers and vehicles. Around two million passengers use the ferry each year. A ferry has operated on the Thames at Woolwich since the 14th century, and commercial crossings operated intermittently until the mid-19th. The free service opened in 1889 after tolls were abolished on bridges to the west of London. Traffic increased in the 20th century because of the rise in motor vehicle traffic and it remained popular because of the lack of nearby bridges. Pedestrian use dropped after the construction of a parallel foot tunnel and the extension of the Docklands Light Railway to Woolwich Arsenal station. Alternatives such as the Thames Gateway Bridge and Gallions Reach Crossing have been proposed as replacements, but there are no plans to discontinue the Woolwich Ferry as long as there is demand. Services North Circular and South Circular Roads. The Woolwich foot tunnel runs alongside the ferry and the Docklands Light Railway parallels the route from King George V to Woolwich Arsenal. The service links Woolwich in the Royal Borough of Greenwich with North Woolwich in the London Borough of Newham. It also links two ends of the inner London orbital road routes: the North Circular and the South Circular. On weekdays, the ferry operates from 6.10 am until 8 pm with a two-boat service (10 minutes nominal interval between sailings); on Saturdays, from 6.10 am to 8 pm with a one-boat service (15 minutes nominal interval; the last south-to-north sailing is 15 minutes earlier at 7.45 pm); on Sundays, from 11.30 am to 7.30 pm with a one- boat service (last south-to-north sailing at 7.15 pm). The ferries can carry heavy goods vehicles and other road traffic across the river, up to a maximum height of and width of . The service is free for all traffic; in 2012 Transport for London (TfL) estimated a subsidy cost of 76.5p per passenger. =Nearest alternative crossings= The nearest alternative crossing for pedestrians is the Woolwich foot tunnel about 100 metres (110 yds) to the east. A Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station, Woolwich Arsenal on the south side of the Thames, was opened in January 2009 as the new terminus of the London City Airport branch. King George V DLR station, on the opposite side of the river, is close to the north ferry dock. The nearest vehicle alternatives are the Blackwall Tunnel about upstream to the west, or the Dartford Crossing around downstream to the east. Both tunnels have height restrictions for heavy goods vehicles, and users of the Dartford Crossing incur toll charges. History =Early services= There has been a connection across the Thames between what is now Old Woolwich and what would later be North Woolwich since the Norman Conquest. The area was mentioned in Domesday Book as belonging to Hamon, the dapifer (steward), \\"which belong to (pertinent in) Woolwich\\"; the \\"pertinent\\" here refers to the portion of land north of the Thames yet also part of the county of Kent. State papers in 1308 show that a service was running between North Woolwich and Warren Lane. That year, William de Wicton sold the business to William atte Halle for ¬£10. The ferry was subsequently sold in 1320 for 100 silver marks. Cross-river traffic increased following the establishment of the Royal Arsenal in 1671. To enable movement of troops and supplies, the army established its own ferry in 1810. The following year an Act of Parliament established a commercial ferry company, but it was dissolved in 1844. In 1846, the Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway extended its lines to include a Thames wharf branch; eventually three steam ferries operated, but they proved inadequate to meet the growing demand. In October 1880, a public meeting was held in Woolwich to discuss setting up a locally run steam-ferry service, but the cost was seen as prohibitive. Following the establishment of the Metropolitan Board of Works, which had taken over toll bridges in west London and opened them to free public use, it was suggested that the board should fund a free crossing of the Thames in east London. Proposals were made to provide services at Woolwich and further upstream at Greenwich, but the latter plan was abandoned. In 1884 the board agreed to provide two steam-powered ferries, each costing ¬£10,650, and asked chief engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette to lead design and construction. In September 1887 Messrs Mowlem and company were awarded contracts valued at ¬£54,900 to build approaches, bridges and pontoons. =Modern service= The service was officially opened on 23 March 1889, with the paddle steamer Gordon. Two days before the first service, the Metropolitan Board of Works was replaced by the London County Council (LCC), and the opening ceremony was conducted by Lord Rosebery instead of the expected Bazalgette. The sister vessel Duncan was introduced on 20 April. By the end of the 1920s, the rise in motor traffic had put pressure on the ferry's capacity. A proposed bridge between Shooter's Hill and East Ham was rejected as too obvious a target for wartime bombings, and a third vessel was introduced instead. Because of the lack of a fixed crossing, the Thames became a psychological barrier for those living in the East End of London, who could only use a limited number of routes to cross the river, including the Woolwich Ferry. The lack of a suitable alternative route was instrumental in creating plans for what eventually became the Dartford Crossing further downstream. Traffic queueing for the Woolwich Ferry in 1955. The conversion to a Roll On Roll Off vehicle service in 1963 reduced waiting times. By the 1950s it was still quicker for ferry traffic to divert via the Blackwall Tunnel even with all three vessels operating at full capacity. In April 1963, the paddle steamers were replaced and the ferry service upgraded to a Roll On Roll Off model, reducing waiting times on the approach roads. The LCC continued to operate the ferry until it was replaced by the Greater London Council (GLC) on 31 March 1965. In 1964, Marples Ridgway started building the current reinforced concrete terminals, which can operate over a tidal range. The current terminals were opened in 1966. After the abolition of the GLC in 1986, the responsibility for operating the service was transferred to the Secretary of State for Transport, who contracted the then London Borough of Greenwich to run the service. Asset ownership and operating rights were subsequently transferred to Transport for London (TfL) on the establishment of the Greater London Authority, but the London Borough of Greenwich continued to operate the ferry on behalf of TfL. In March 2008, the London Borough of Greenwich gave TfL notice that it would cease operating the service from 30 September 2008. On 12 September TfL announced that the outsourcing group Serco would take over the operation of the service from 1 October 2008; the contract ran initially until 31 March 2010. Control of the crossing passed from Serco to Briggs Marine, which was expanding into public passenger services, in December 2012. The company was awarded a ¬£50 million seven-year contract, which began in April 2013. In 2014, TfL began an upgrade of the ferry service, starting by refurbishing the piers and in 2016 ordering two new boats to replace the existing vessels that were nearing the end of their working life. In early 2017, it was announced that the new ferries were being built by Polish firm Remontowa to a design by LMG Marin. The diesel-electric hybrid vessels have of space for road vehicles over several lanes and dedicated cyclist accommodation. The vessels are licensed to carry 150 passengers segregated from road traffic. Continuing the tradition of naming the ferries after local people, it was announced in June 2017 that the two new vessels would be named after Dame Vera Lynn, a singer and entertainer from nearby East Ham, and Ben Woollacott, the 19-year-old deckhand on the Woolwich Ferry who drowned after being dragged overboard in a mooring accident in 2011. In October 2018, the Woolwich Ferry was suspended for four months in order to undertake major repair work for the piers, and the existing vessels were taken out of service.Woolwich veterans retired Ships Monthly December 2018 page 10 The foot tunnel remained open. The ferry service resumed on 1 February 2019. Upon the expiry of Briggs Marine's contract in December 2020, the service will be by London River Services.Woolwich Ferry Take-Over Ships Monthly July 2020 page 11 =Incidents= On 3 August 2011, 19-year-old ferry worker Ben Woollacott died after falling off the boat into the River Thames. The MAIB report published in August 2012 blamed \\"unseamanlike working practices\\" during the unmooring operation for the death. When two new ships were bought to update the service in 2018, one was named after him. Fleet HGVs owing to restrictions in the Blackwall Tunnel and northbound Dartford Crossing. The first ferries were the side-loading paddle steamers Gordon, Duncan and Hutton, named after General Gordon of Khartoum, Colonel Francis Duncan MP and Professor Charles Hutton. Each was powered by a condensing engine manufactured by John Peen & Son of Greenwich, producing 100 nominal horsepower. The initial fleet was eventually replaced, starting in 1923 with The Squire (named after William Squires, a former mayor of Woolwich), and in 1930 with the Will Crooks (Crooks was Labour MP for Woolwich, 1903‚Äì21) and the John Benn (Benn was a member of the London County Council, Liberal MP for St George‚Äîwhich included Wapping‚Äîand grandfather of Tony Benn). Three vessels were built in Dundee in 1963 by the Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company to replace the paddle steamers, and were each named after prominent local politicians: James Newman (mayor of Woolwich, 1923‚Äì25), John Burns, and Ernest Bevin. These ferries featured Voith/Schneider Electric propulsion systems for manoeuvrability. A cycloidal propeller is fitted centrally at either end, each driven by a 500bhp 6-cylinder Mirrlees Blackstone diesel engine. Transport for London introduced an Art On The River scheme in 2014, showing decorative artwork on the ferry vessels. These vessels ceased operation on 5 October 2018, after which service was suspended for four months. Two new vessels, the Ben Woollacott and the Dame Vera Lynn, were delivered from the Remontowa shipyard in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland, to replace the previous fleet in October 2018.New Thames Pair Arrive Ships Monthly January 2019 page 11 The new vessels entered service on 1 February 2019. Passenger numbers AEC Regent III RT bus embarking the Woolwich Ferry in 1979 The ferry typically carries about two million passengers a year; occupants of vehicles (including drivers) are counted as passengers. In 2012 the ferry carried around 20,000 vehicles and 50,000 passengers weekly. At all times of day, but particularly at peak hours, it is common for vehicles to have to queue beyond the next ferry departure. Various improvements have been made to the vehicle queueing arrangements over the years, especially to avoid impacting local traffic. For foot passengers, bus services connect to both terminals. There is a small bus station on the north side, but some cross- river foot passengers take the foot tunnel instead. About 300 foot passengers used the ferry daily between 1983 and 1985. Further competition arrived in 2009 with the extension to Woolwich of the Docklands Light Railway, which crosses under the river to the east of the crossing and the tunnel, and has led to a reduction in the number of foot passengers using the ferry. Future The ferry service provides one of the few road crossings of the Thames east of the City of London. As long as there is a demand for a vehicle ferry it is unlikely to be discontinued, and doing so would require changing an 1885 Act of Parliament. Planning applications were submitted for a new bridge, the Thames Gateway Bridge, close to the Woolwich Ferry, in 2004 although the project was cancelled in 2008. In 2012, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, announced the Gallions Reach Crossing, a replacement ferry service running further east from Beckton to Thamesmead which was expected to open in 2017. This did not occur and has been replaced with proposals for either a new bridge or tunnel in the area. TfL planning director Richard de Cani has said that the ferry will continue to operate as long as there are no alternatives, and there are no current plans to discontinue the service. Tolls cannot be levied on the ferry without changing the 1885 Act of Parliament. However, it is possible that the service may eventually be tolled in conjunction with other projects. Media appearances The Woolwich ferry has made several appearances on TV and film. The John Benn is seen being destroyed by the titular monster in the film Behemoth, the Sea Monster. A detailed scale model is used to interact with a model of the monster's head, which capsizes the ship in the Thames.

It is sometimes placed in the monotypic genus Bugeranus. Taxonomy The first formal description of the wattled crane was by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789 under the binomial name Ardea carunculata. Gmelin based his account on the \\"wattled heron\\" that had been described and illustrated by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1785. The specific epithet is from the Latin caruncula meaning \\"a small piece of flesh\\". The wattled crane was formerly placed in its own genus Bugeranus. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that the genus Grus within the crane family was not monophyletic and that the wattled crane was a sister species to a clade containing the blue crane and the demoiselle crane. In the resulting reorganization of the genera, the wattled crane was moved to the genus Grus. Some taxonomists retain the wattled crane within Bugeranus. The wattled crane is monotypic: there are no recognised subspecies. Description A pair foraging in Moremi Game Reserve, Botswana. At a height known to range from , it is the largest crane in Africa and is the second tallest species of crane in the world, after the sarus crane. It is also the tallest flying bird native to Africa second only among all birds to the two species of ostrich. The wattled crane is taller and, despite the appearance of gracility imparted by its sharp but slim beak and slender neck and legs, is the heaviest on average of several very large, long-legged waders in Africa (i.e. the 2 largest African storks, shoebill, greater flamingo, goliath heron). It is also roughly the fourth heaviest African flying bird after the great white pelican, the much more sexually dimorphic kori bustard and cape vulture.

Going on standard measurements, it is the second largest proportioned crane after the sarus species, outsizing in these respects even the ostentatiously heavier red-crowned crane. Three adult wattled cranes averaged . The back and wings are ashy gray. The feathered portion of the head is dark slate gray above the eyes and on the crown, but is otherwise white, including the wattles, which are almost fully feathered and hang down from under the upper throat.

The skin in front of the eye extending to the base of the beak and tip of the wattles is red and bare of feathers and covered by small round wart-like bumps. Wattled cranes have long bills and black legs and toes. Males and females are virtually indistinguishable, although males tend to be slightly larger. Juveniles have tawny body plumage, lack the bare skin on the face, and have less prominent wattles. The generation length (in years) is 13.BirdLife International 2018. Bugeranus carunculatus.

Range The wattled crane occurs in eleven sub-Saharan countries in Africa, including an isolated population in the highlands of Ethiopia. More than half of the world's wattled cranes occur in Zambia, but the single largest concentration occurs in the Okavango Delta of Botswana. Wattled cranes are thought to have historically ranged over a much larger area including coastal West Africa. The range has certainly retracted considerably in historical times.

It requires shallow marsh-like habitats with a good deal of sedge-based vegetation. All cranes are omnivorous. The principal food of the wattled crane is mainly aquatic eating the tubers and rhizomes of submerged sedges and water lilies. It is one of the more herbivorous of extant cranes. The other primary portion of the diet consists of aquatic insects. They will supplement the diet with snails, amphibians and snakes when the opportunity arises. Roughly 90% of foraging done by this species occurs in shallow waters. They typically forage by digging vigorously with their bill into the muddy soil. On occasion, it will eat grain and grass seed as well, but does so much less often than the other three African crane species. Behavior displaying wings There does seem to be some seasonal movements in this crane species, but they are not well-known. Movements seem to be dictacted by local water conditions rather than by seasonal temperature variations. During local floods, the number of wattled cranes can increase from almost none to as much as 3,000 individuals. These movements, in pursuit of ideal feeding conditions, seem more opportunistic movement rather than a fixed migration pattern. On the other hand, there has been observed a migration movement from the high to the low plateaus in Mozambique for the species. Somewhat gregarious outsize of the breeding season, flocks of wattled cranes can often include 10 or more birds, occasionally as many as 89 individuals. The crowned cranes occasionally interact with this species but, given those species largely terrestrial foraging patterns, this is uncommon. Two species are known to associate closely with wattled cranes due to shared habitat and dietary preferences: the antelope known as the lechwe and the spur-winged goose, the latter nonetheless usually being found in slightly deeper waters. There is no data on significant predation on the wattled crane, as its size often insures it from being killed. Jackals may be occasional predators of chicks. Wattled cranes commence their breeding season around April. Most nest are sloppily crushed impressions of grass along the border of a marsh. They may use an old spur-winged goose nest or make their own. Eggs are laid approximately 3 weeks after the nests are built. The average clutch size of the species is reportedly the smallest of any of the world's cranes, with an average of 1.6 eggs. Even if there are two eggs, usually only one chick successfully survives to hatch or fledge. The incubation period, roughly 33 to 36 days, is on average the longest of any crane and both parents participate. The chicks are immediately fed by both parents, which take shifts. After around 80 days, the chick(s) start to forage with their parents. At the first sign of any danger, the parents force their young into tall grasses to hide. The fledging period occurs at 100‚Äì150 days, the longest it takes any crane to fledge. The young remain with their parents for up to a year (when the next breeding period starts) and may gather in flocks with unrelated juveniles. Threats Destruction, alteration, and degradation of wetland habitats constitute the most significant threats to the wattled crane, perhaps one of the most habitat sensitive of all cranes. Hydroelectric power projects and other water development have caused fundamental changes in the species expansive floodplain habitats, and their most important food source Eleocharis spp. Human and livestock disturbance, powerline collisions, mass aerial spraying of tsetse flies, and illegal collection of eggs, chicks and adults for food are also significant threats to wattled cranes throughout their range. The wattled crane is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. It is listed as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List.

Collection Portrait of Captain James Cook by Nathaniel Dance at the National Maritime Museum Since the earliest times Greenwich has had associations with the sea and navigation. It was a landing place for the Romans, Henry VIII lived here, the Navy has roots on the waterfront, and Charles II founded the Royal Observatory in 1675 for \\"finding the longitude of places\\". The home of Greenwich Mean Time and the Prime Meridian since 1884, Greenwich has long been a centre for astronomical study, while navigators across the world have set their clocks according to its time of day. The Museum has the most important holdings in the world on the history of Britain at sea comprising more than two million items, including maritime art (both British and 17th-century Dutch), cartography, manuscripts including official public records, ship models and plans, scientific and navigational instruments, instruments for time-keeping and astronomy (based at the Observatory).

In late August 2018, several groups were vying for the right to purchase the 5,500 relics that were an asset of the bankrupt Premier Exhibitions. Eventually, the National Maritime Museum, Titanic Belfast and Titanic Foundation Limited, as well as National Museums Northern Ireland, joined together as a consortium that was raising money to purchase the 5,500 artifacts. The group intended to keep all of the items together as a single exhibit. The oceanographer Robert Ballard said that he favoured this bid as it would ensure that the memorabilia would be permanently displayed in Belfast (where the Titanic was built) and in Greenwich. The museums were critical of the bid process set by the Bankruptcy Court in Jacksonville, Florida. The minimum bid for the auction on 11 October 2018 was set at US$21.5 million (¬£16.5m) and the consortium did not have enough funding to meet that amount.Titanic: Salvaged treasure may not return to Belfast BBC 5 October 2018Bankrupt Premier Exhibitions Inc. owns 5,500 items from the ill-fated ocean liner The Basch Report 3 October 2018 The site The museum was officially established in 1934 within the of Greenwich Royal Park in the buildings formerly occupied by the Royal Hospital School, before it moved to Holbrook in Suffolk. The gardens immediately to the north of the museum were reinstated in the late 1870s following construction of the cut-and-cover tunnel between Greenwich and Maze Hill stations. The tunnel comprised part of the final section of the London and Greenwich Railway and opened in 1878. A full redevelopment of the main galleries, centring on what is now the Neptune Court, which was designed by Rick Mather Architects and funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, was completed in 1999.

It lies on the A85 road between Perth and Crianlarich, and the A822 between Greenloaning and Aberfeldy. The A822 joins the A823, which leads to Dunfermline. Crieff has become a hub for tourism, famous for its whisky and history of cattle droving. Attractions include the Caithness Glass Visitor Centre and Glenturret Distillery. The nearby Innerpeffray Library (founded about 1680), is Scotland's oldest lending library. St Mary's Chapel, adjacent to the library, dates from 1508. Both are open to the public: the library is run by a charitable trust, while the chapel is in the care of Historic Scotland. History For a number of centuries Highlanders came south to Crieff to sell their black cattle, whose meat and hides were avidly sought by the growing urban populations in Lowland Scotland and the north of England. The town acted as a gathering point for the Michaelmas cattle sale held each year, when the surrounding fields and hillsides would be black with the tens of thousands of cattle, some from as far away as Caithness and the Outer Hebrides. (In 1790 the population of Crieff was about 1,200, which gave a ratio of ten cows per person.) During the October Tryst (as the cattle gathering was known), Crieff was a prototype \\"wild west\\" town. Milling with the cattle were horse thieves, bandits and drunken drovers. The inevitable killings were punished on the Kind Gallows, for which Crieff became known throughout Europe. By the 18th century the original hanging tree used by the Earls of Strathearn had been replaced by a formal wooden structure in an area called Gallowhaugh ‚Äì now Gallowhill, at the bottom of Burrell Street. What is now Ford Road was Gallowford Road which led down past the gallows to the crossing point over the River Earn. In such a prominent position, Highlanders passing along the principal route would see hanged bodies dangling overhead, prompting from them the words, \\"God bless you, and the Devil damn you.\\" Lord Macaulay's history talks of a score of plaids hanging in a row, but the remains of the Gallows ‚Äì held in Perth Museum ‚Äì suggest the maximum capacity was only six. Crieff's parish church kept a strong Episcopalian dominance from the Reformation in 1560 until the Revolution of 1688. In 1682 William Murray ignored the Presbytery and brought Episcopalian format into worship, including the Lord's Prayer and the Doxology. The Apostles' Creed was also used at baptisms. After the Jacobite victory at Killiecrankie, Murray quoted the 118th Psalm: \\"This is the day God made, in it we'll joy triumphantly\\". Rob Roy MacGregor visited Crieff on many occasions, often to sell cattle. Rob Roy's outlaw son was pursued through the streets of Crieff by soldiers and killed. In the second week of October 1714 the Highlanders gathered in Crieff for the October Tryst. By day Crieff was full of soldiers and government spies. Just after midnight, Rob Roy and his men marched to Crieff Town Square and rang the town bell. In front of the gathering crowd they sang Jacobite songs and drank a good many loyal toasts to their uncrowned King James VIII. In 1716, 350 Highlanders returning from the Battle of Sheriffmuir burned most of Crieff to the ground. In 1731, James Drummond, 3rd Duke of Perth, laid out the town's central James Square and established a textile industry with a flax factory. In the 1745 rising the Highlanders were itching to fire the town again and were reported as saying \\"she shoud be a braw toun gin she haed anither sing\\". But it was saved by the Duke of Perth ‚Äì a friend and supporter of Prince Charles. In February 1746 the Jacobite army was quartered in and around the town with Prince Charles Edward Stuart holding his final war council in the old Drummond Arms Inn in James Square ‚Äì located behind the present abandoned hotel building in Hill Street. He also had his horse shod at the blacksmith's in King Street. Later in the month he reviewed his troops in front of Ferntower House, on what is today the Crieff Golf Course. In the 19th century, Crieff became a fashionable destination for tourists visiting the Highlands and a country retreat for wealthy businessmen from Edinburgh, Glasgow and beyond. Many such visitors attended the Crieff hydropathic establishment, now the Crieff Hydro, which opened in 1868. Crieff still functions as a tourist centre. The large villas stand as testaments to its use by wealthy city- dwellers. Crieff was once served by Crieff railway station, which linked the town to Perth, Comrie and Gleneagles.Railscot Retrieved 29 July 2018. The station was opened in 1856 by the Crieff Junction Railway, but closed in 1964 by British Railways as one of the Beeching cuts. Fame in verse Crieff was praised by the poetaster William McGonagall in \\"Crieff\\". > \\"Ye lovers of the picturesque, if ye wish to drown your grief, Take my > advice, and visit the ancient town of Crieff.\\" Events Every year the town hosts the Crieff Highland Games, which include music and dancing competitions and feats of strength.

The building was designed by Mitchell/Giurgola & Thorp Architects and built by a Concrete Constructions and John Holland joint venture. It was opened on 1988 by Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia. It cost more than A$1.1 billion to build. Federal Parliament meetings were held in Melbourne until 1927. Between 1927 and 1988, the Parliament of Australia met in the Provisional Parliament House, which is now known as \\"Old Parliament House\\". Construction of Australia's permanent Parliament House was delayed while its location was debated. Construction of the new building began in 1981. The principal design of the structure is based on the shape of two boomerangs and is topped by an flagpole. Parliament House contains 4,700 rooms, and many areas are open to the public. The main foyer contains a marble staircase and leads to the Great Hall, which has a large tapestry on display. The House of Representatives chamber is decorated green, while the Senate chamber has a red colour scheme. Between the two chambers is the Members' Hall, which has a water feature and is not open to the public. The Ministerial Wing houses the Prime Minister's Office and other ministerial offices. Before the establishment of Canberra Parliament House, Melbourne, was home to Federal Parliament for 26 years from 1901 to 1927. In 1901, when the six British colonies in Australia federated to form the Commonwealth of Australia, Melbourne and Sydney were the two largest cities in the country, but the long history of rivalry between them meant that neither could become the national capital. Section 125 of the Constitution of Australia therefore provided that: > The seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be determined by the > Parliament, and shall be within territory which shall have been granted to > or acquired by the Commonwealth, and shall be vested in and belong to the > Commonwealth, and shall be in the State of New South Wales, and be distant > not less than one hundred miles from Sydney. Such territory shall contain an > area of not less than one hundred square miles, and such portion thereof as > shall consist of Crown lands shall be granted to the Commonwealth without > any payment therefor. The Parliament shall sit at Melbourne until it meet at > the seat of Government. In 1909, after much argument, the Parliament decided that the new capital would be in the southern part of New South Wales, on the site which is now Canberra. The Commonwealth acquired control over the land in 1911, but World War I intervened, and nothing was done for some years to build the city. Federal Parliament did not leave Melbourne until 1927. In the meantime the Australian Parliament met in the 19th-century edifice of Parliament House, Melbourne,Australia Spirit of a Nation, p. 101 while the Victorian State Parliament met in the nearby Royal Exhibition Building for 26 years. =Old Parliament House= Old Parliament House opening, 1927 After World War I the Federal Capital Advisory Committee was established to prepare Canberra to be the seat of government, including the construction of a Parliament House. The committee decided that it would be best to erect a \\"provisional\\" building, to serve for a predicted 50 years until a new, \\"permanent\\" House could be built. In the end, Old Parliament House was Parliament's home for 61 years. In the last decade of its use as a parliament the building had a chronic shortage of available space. Turning the first sod, Parliament House, Canberra New Parliament House In 1978 the Fraser government decided to proceed with a new building on Capital Hill, and the Parliament House Construction Authority was created. A two-stage competition was announced, for which the Authority consulted the Royal Australian Institute of Architects and, together with the National Capital Development Commission, made available to competitors a brief and competition documents. The design competition drew 329 entries from 29 countries. The competition winner was the Philadelphia-based architectural firm of Mitchell/Giurgola, with the on-site work directed by the Italian-born architect Romaldo Giurgola,Tony Stephens, \\"Like his work, he'll blend into the landscape\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 1999 with a design which involved burying most of the building under Capital Hill, and capping the edifice with an enormous spire topped by a large Australian flag. The facades, however, included deliberate imitation of some of the patterns of the Old Parliament House, so that there is a slight resemblance despite the massive difference of scale. Aerial view of Parliament House Giurgola placed an emphasis on the visual aesthetics of the building by using landscape architect Peter G. Rolland to direct civil engineers, a reversal of the traditional roles in Australia. Rolland played a pivotal role in the design, development and coordination of all surface elements including pool design, paving, conceptual lighting and artwork locations. Horticultural experts from the Australian National Botanic Gardens and a government nursery were consulted on plant selection. Permanent irrigation has been limited to only the more formal areas. Irwinconsult was commissioned to provide structural engineering, including quality assurance of all structural elements, to deliver a building with a designed life-span of 200 years.http://www.irwinconsult.com.au/experiences/parliament-house-canberra-2/ Construction began in 1981, and the House was intended to be ready by Australia Day, 1988, the 200th anniversary of European settlement in Australia. It was expected to cost . Neither the deadline nor the budget was met. Opening ceremony in 1988 The building was opened by Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia on 1988,The Australian Political System, p. 737 the anniversary of the opening of both the first Federal Parliament in Melbourne on 1901 by the Duke of Cornwall and York (later King George V),Australia Spirit of a Nation, p. 100 and of the Provisional Parliament House in Canberra on 1927 by the Duke of York (later King George VI).Australia Spirit of a Nation, p. 146 The flag flown from the flagpole is , about the size of half a tennis court. The flagpole weighs 250 tonnes and is made of polished stainless steel from Wollongong. It was designed to be the pinnacle of Parliament House and is an easily recognisable symbol of national government. It is visible by day from outside and inside Parliament House and floodlit at night. The flag itself weighs approximately . The site covers . The building was designed to sit above Old Parliament House when seen from a distance. The building is four metres (13 feet) higher than the original height of the hill. About one million cubic metres (35,000,000 cubic feet) of rock had to be excavated from the site. It was used to fill low-lying areas in the city. Most of the granite used was sourced from Australia. Twice the amount needed was quarried as a very high standard of granite was required particularly for the curved walls. It was proposed originally to demolish Old Parliament House so that there would be an uninterrupted vista from the New Parliament House to Lake Burley Griffin and the Australian War Memorial, but there were successful representations for the preservation of the historic building, which now houses a parliamentary museum. The original idea was for Parliament House to be open free to the public, and the sweeping lawns leading up to the entrances were intended to symbolise this. The building is a major visitor attraction in Canberra with about visits each year. With the increased risk of terrorist attacks in recent years, the security of Parliament House has been increased greatly. One result has been the construction of crash barriers blocking vehicular access to the lawns. The front architecture built into Capital Hill, including the forecourt and main entrance, and illustrating a ground-level view of the boomerang-shaped design = Layout = The Great Hall in Parliament House. The tapestry at the rear of the room is an enlarged version of an Arthur Boyd painting, and at is one of the largest tapestries in the world. The public entrance to Parliament House opens into the main foyer leading into the Great Hall, which features a tapestry based on a painting by Arthur Boyd, the original of which is also displayed in the building. Functions that have parliamentary and federal relevance often take place here, but the Great Hall is also open to functions for the general public, such as weddings, and the nearby University of Canberra hosts graduation ceremonies here. Below the tapestry of the Great Hall is a removable division which opens on to the Members' Hall, which has a water feature at its centre. This is an area restricted to security-classified occupants of the building and special visitors. Directly ahead of the Members' Hall is the Ministerial Wing, housing the office suites of the Prime Minister and government Ministers. The Members' Hall has access to the House of Representatives and the Senate buildings to the left and right of the main entrance to the halls respectively. Public access to the visitors' galleries and the Main Committee Room is via an upper level reached by impressive marble staircases ascending from the entrance foyer. There are also 19 committee rooms which are open to the public and a highly secure Cabinet Room on the ground floor.  House of Representatives  The House of Representatives In commemoration of the colour scheme of the British House of Commons, the House of Representatives is decorated in green. However, the colour is muted to suggest the colour of eucalyptus leaves, or the Australian bush. From the perspective of the image, the press gallery is ahead, with public galleries containing 388 seats to the left and right. Soundproofed galleries for school groups are directly above these, as no talking is permitted when the House members are present. A part of the front bench, and the dispatch boxes Frontbench (Cabinet) members approach the table with the ornate box (pictured), known as the despatch box, to speak. Backbenchers have a microphone on their desk and merely stand to speak (unless they cannot stand), in accordance with standing order 60. Also on the table is a copy of Hansard and where the clerk and deputy clerk sit. The clerk needs to know all the rules of Parliament and is responsible for ringing the bells during a division (voting). In front of the clerk are the hour glasses. The outer glasses measure four minutes and the middle glass measures one minute. These glasses are turned when there is a division; one of the four-minute glasses is turned and the bells will ring and the clocks will flash green for the House of Representatives or red for the Senate for four minutes. After the hourglass stops, the house's attendants will lock the doors and the whips will count the votes. Members vote by either moving to the government side of the house for a vote for a bill or the opposition side for a vote against a bill. If there are successive divisions, and there is no debate after the first division, the middle one-minute hourglasses are turned and the bells are rung for one minute. As is the custom with Westminster parliaments, members of the governing party sit to the Speaker's right, and the Opposition sits to the Speaker's left. Independents and minor parties sit on the cross-benches. The long benches (the front benches) closest to the despatch boxes are reserved for the Cabinet on the government's side and the Shadow Cabinet on the Opposition's side.  Senate  The Senate chamber The Senate chamber matches the colour scheme of the House of Lords, decorated in red, but muted to tints of ochre, suggesting the earth and the colours of the outback. The Australian Senate The gallery arrangement is almost identical to that of the House of Representatives. Unlike the House of Representatives, only the leader of the government or opposition in the Senate approaches the lectern; other frontbench senators and all backbench senators have a desk microphone. As can be seen from the illustrations, unlike the House of Representatives, there is no distinction between the front and back benches in the Senate chamber; Senate ministers and their opposition counterparts have the same two-seat benches as all other senators. The press gallery is located above the Senate chamber. The presiding officer of the Australian Senate is the President of the Senate, who occupies a position in the Senate chamber similar to that of the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Behind the seat of the President of the Senate are two large seats which are modern versions of thrones. The larger is used by the Governor-General or the monarch (when visiting) when they open Parliament at the start of a new parliamentary session. The vice- regal consort or the royal consort (when visiting) sits in the smaller throne. = Art collection = The Parliament House Art Collection of over 6,000 works includes commissioned (and purchased) portraits of every prime minister, governor-general, president of the senate and speaker of the house, as well as other works of art significant to Australia.  Reception  The New Parliament House building has been warmly received for its beauty and democratic symbolism, particularly the grass-covered roof that allows visitor access. Member for Fenner, Andrew Leigh has praised the way \\"the building was constructed to emerge out of Capitol Hill - rather than sitting atop it as an imposing structure\\". The new Parliament House is recognised as being more spacious and light-filled than its predecessor, and much less cramped. The building has received criticism for the way in which its design discourages collegiality amongst members. New Parliament House was designed in the late 1970s, in the context of the Sydney Hilton Hotel bombing and the tense political climate following the Dismissal of the Whitlam Government, and thus one of the key elements of the design brief was providing security for the executive. The winning design's solution was to fence off the executive in its own ministerial wing. In practice, this meant it was no longer possible for backbenchers to bump into ministers while passing through the corridors of parliament, increasing a sense of detachment between the two groups. The heart of Old Parliament House was King's Hall, an entrance hall open to the public that connected the House of Representatives and the Senate to the parliamentary library and the refreshment rooms. Inevitably, due to its central location, Kings Hall became a bustling hub where people met and talked, and a place where politicians could mingle with the public and the press gallery. In contrast, the new building situates the library and refreshment rooms at great distance from the two Chambers, and Member's Hall, the foyer that connects the House and the Senate, is not open to the public. As a consequence, Member's Hall lies empty, as parliamentarians have no reason to be there. Similarly, while in the Old Parliament House members of various political parties would inhabit offices that shared the same corridors, New Parliament House segregates opposing parties in different corners of the building, decreasing interaction between members. Members would often only meet their opponents in the adversarial environment of the debating chamber, and many former parliamentarians believe this has heightened the sectarian nature of parliamentary politics in Australia. Don Watson, speechwriter for former Prime Minister Paul Keating, writes: > The place lacks red blood cells. Beyond the chambers there is no sign of the > great contest of ideas for which a national parliament exists. Unlike the > old Parliament House where opponents bumped past each other in the > corridors, met each others eyes, exchanged brutalities in the bar, stood > side by side at urinals, in the new building the Opposition is separated > from the Government by a divide as great as any which separates all of them > from their constituents. As with dogs which meet only through a fence and > cannot sniff each other's backsides, it deepens the everyday animus. Paul Keating himself has lamented walking the corridors of New Parliament House ‚Äúnot feeling like you were part of anything‚Äù. Another former Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, expressed concern the \\"badly designed\\" structure lacks \\"collision space [that] brings people together to...compromise and agree and discuss. I think the design of the building definitely contributes to the fact that there are less cross-party friendships than there were in the old parliament\\". These concerns have been echoed by many former parliamentarians, including Malcolm Fraser, Tom Uren, Peter Walsh, Barry Jones, and Bob Carr. Walsh, a former Finance Minister in the Hawke Government has said the building is \\"an antiseptic, isolated and impersonal place, compared with its predecessor\\".  Function events  The new Parliament House is a central hub for events in Canberra, hosting many of the nation's largest and most important function events. The Parliament House is a place for meetings, conferences (government, and private), celebrations, and other miscellaneous uses. The Parliament House is one of the few parliament houses in the world where private events are permitted. The Parliament House has 14 event spaces that can be used for special events. Solar power project In 2011, the Department of Parliamentary Services commissioned a pilot 43.3 kW photovoltaic system on the roof of Parliament House in Canberra. The system is split between two locations, with 192 panels installed on the Senate wing with the remaining 42 panels on the roof of the Gardeners' Compound. At the time of construction, the system was one of the largest installed for solar power in Australia. According to the Department of Parliamentary Services, the system was switched on in June 2011 and has performed as expected by providing enough power for lighting in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. This equates to an approximate saving of $9,000 which is expected to rise to $17,000 annually. The system received an award from the Clean Energy Council in 2012 for \\"Best design and installation of a grid-connect power system greater than 10 kW\\".http://www.cleanenergyweek.com.au/awards/solartech.html  Engineering heritage award  Both the old and new Parliament House received an Engineering Heritage National Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.

At least two more possible orders are known only as fossils, namely Embrithopoda and Desmostylia. Molecular evidence indicates that Paenungulata (or at least its extant members) is part of the cohort Afrotheria, an ancient assemblage of mainly African mammals of great diversity. The other members of this cohort are the orders Afrosoricida (tenrecs and golden moles), Macroscelidea (elephant shrews) and Tubulidentata (aardvarks). Of the five orders, hyraxes are the most basal, followed by embrithopods; the remaining orders (sirenians, desmostylians, and elephants) are more closely interrelated. These latter three are grouped as the Tethytheria, because it is believed that their common ancestors lived on the shores of the prehistoric Tethys Sea; however, recent myoglobin studies indicate that even Hyracoidea had an aquatic ancestor.  History  In 1945, George Gaylord Simpson used traditional taxonomic techniques to group these spectacularly diverse mammals in the superorder he named Paenungulata (\\"almost ungulates\\"), but there were many loose threads in unravelling their genealogy. For example, hyraxes in his Paenungulata had some characteristics suggesting they might be connected to the Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates, such as horses and rhinos). Indeed, early taxonomists placed the Hyracoidea closest to the rhinoceroses because of their dentition. When genetic techniques were developed for inspecting amino acid differences among haemoglobin sequences the most parsimonious cladograms depicted Simpson's Paenungulata as an authentic clade and as one of the first groups to diversify from the basal placental mammals (Eutheria). The amino acid sequences reject a connection between extant paenungulates and perissodactyls (odd-toed ungulates). However, a 2014 cladistic analysis placed anthracobunids and desmostylians, two major extinct groups that have been considered to be non-African afrotheres, close to each other within Perissodactyla. Phylogeny Gallery Extinct orders Each of the extinct orders, the Embrithopoda and Desmostylia, was as unique in its members' ways of making a living as the three orders that survive. Embrithopods were rhinoceros-like herbivorous mammals with plantigrade feet, and desmostylians were hippopotamus-like amphibious animals. Their walking posture and diet have been the subject of speculation, but tooth wear indicates that desmostylians browsed on terrestrial plants and had a posture similar to other large hoofed mammals.

The Order was created in 1783 by George III at the request of the then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, The 3rd Earl Temple (created The 1st Marquess of Buckingham in 1784). The regular creation of knights of Saint Patrick lasted until 1922, when most of Ireland gained independence as the Irish Free State, a dominion within what was then known as the British Commonwealth of Nations. While the Order technically still exists, no knight of St Patrick has been created since 1936, and the last surviving knight, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, died in 1974. The Queen, however, remains the Sovereign of the Order, and one officer, the Ulster King of Arms (now represented in the office of Norroy and Ulster King of Arms), also survives. St Patrick is patron of the order; its motto is Quis separabit?, Latin for \\"Who will separate [us]?\\": an allusion to the Vulgate translation of Romans 8:35, \\"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?\\"According to Galloway (pp 171‚Äì2), the motto was borrowed from the Order of the Friendly Brothers of St Patrick, but was also appropriate politically in expressing a desire for unity Most British orders of chivalry cover the entire kingdom, but the three most exalted ones each pertain to one constituent country only. The Order of St Patrick, which pertains to Ireland, is the most junior of these three in precedence and age. Its equivalent in England, The Most Noble Order of the Garter, is the oldest order of chivalry in the United Kingdom, dating to the middle fourteenth century. The Scottish equivalent is The Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle, dating in its modern form to 1687.  History  Badge of the order of St Patrick The installation dinner for the founding of the order took place on 17 March 1783 in the Great Hall of Dublin Castle. = Early history = The order was founded in 1783, a year after the grant of substantial autonomy to Ireland, as a means of rewarding (or obtaining) political support in the Irish Parliament. The Order of the Bath, founded in 1725, was instituted for similar reasons. The statutes of the Order restricted membership to men who were both knights and gentlemen, the latter being defined as having three generations of \\"noblesse\\" (i.e. ancestors bearing coats of arms) on both their father's and mother's side.1783 Statutes, Article III, quoted in Nicolas, p. 9. The 1905 Statutes, quoted in Galloway p 281ff, remove these restrictions on membership. In practice, however, only Irish Peers and British Princes were ever appointed to the Order. The cross of St Patrick (a red saltire on a white background) was chosen as one of the symbols of the Order. A flag of this design was later incorporated into the Union Flag. Its association with St. Patrick or with Ireland prior to the foundation of the Order is unclear, however. One of the first knights was The 2nd Duke of Leinster, whose arms carry the same cross.See Image:Duke of Leinster coa.png The Irish Crown Jewels The Order of St Patrick earned international coverage when, in 1907, its insignia, known generally as the Irish Crown Jewels, were stolen from the Bedford Tower in Dublin Castle shortly before a visit by the Order's Sovereign, King Edward VII. Their whereabouts remain a mystery. = Post-1922 = The last non-Royal member appointed to the Order was the 3rd Duke of Abercorn in 1922, who served as the first Governor of Northern Ireland. When the Irish Free State left the United Kingdom in December of that same year, the Irish Executive Council under W. T. Cosgrave chose to make no further appointments to the Order. The British Government continued to entertain hopes for the Order's revival as a pan-Irish institution. Therefore, while there was no legal or constitutional bar to the British Government continuing to make appointments from among British subjects resident in Northern Ireland, it chose not to do so. Since then, only three people have been appointed to the Order, all members of the British Royal Family. The then-Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII and later Duke of Windsor) was appointed in 1927According to Galloway, p 155, neither Cosgrave or his government registered any protest, possibly because they had no objection and his younger brothers, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, in 1934 and Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), in 1936. It is likely that these appointments were considered possible because the Irish Free State continued to recognise the British monarch as its official head of state. In 1937, however, the Irish Free State adopted a new constitution, rendering the Crown's position in Irish affairs ambiguous. The ambiguity was resolved 12 years later when √âire (as the Irish Free State had been renamed in December 1937) formally declared itself a republic and left the British Commonwealth, officially leaving in April 1949. The basis for such appointments thus ceased and no further ones have been made. The 1st Duke of Gloucester at his death in 1974 was the last surviving member of the Order. The last living non-Royal member of the Order, The 9th Earl of Shaftesbury, died in 1961. The Order has, however, never formally been abolished. = Possible revival = Collar of the Order of St Patrick Prime Minister Winston Churchill suggested reviving the Order in 1943 to recognise the services of General The Hon. Sir Harold Alexander in Tunisia, but the opinion of the other ministers and civil servants was that it would upset the diplomatic balance between London and Dublin.Galloway, pp 152‚Äì6 Taoiseach Se√°n Lemass considered reviving the Order during the 1960s, but did not take a decision. The Constitution of Ireland provides, \\"Titles of nobility shall not be conferred by the State\\" (Article 40.2.1¬∞) and \\"No title of nobility or of honour may be accepted by any citizen except with the prior approval of the Government\\" (Article 40.2.2¬∞). Legal experts are divided on whether this clause prohibits the awarding of membership of the Order of St Patrick to Irish citizens, but some suggest that the phrase \\"titles of nobility\\" implies hereditary peerages and other noble titles, not lifetime honours such as knighthoods. In recent decades, however, this prohibition has almost never been enforced. Irish citizens who are today offered British honours rarely apply for permission prior to accepting. In practice, it has come to be understood that Irish citizens who receive such awards--including, for example, former Attorney General Peter Sutherland, rocker/political activist Bob Geldof, and the late talk show host Sir Terry Wogan--do so on a purely honorary basis. They cannot use the honorific 'Sir' or 'Dame' unless they subsequently adopt British or Commonwealth nationality (which Wogan did).  Composition  = Members = The 2nd Earl of Dudley (Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, 1902‚Äì1905) wearing the Irish Crown Jewels as ex officio Grand Master of the Order of St Patrick. The British monarch is the Sovereign of the Order of St Patrick. The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the monarch's representative in Ireland, served as the Grand Master.1783 Statutes, Article II, quoted in Nicolas, p. 9 The office of Lord Lieutenant was abolished in 1922; the last Lord Lieutenant and Grand Master was The 1st Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent.Galloway, p. 103 Initially, the statutes of the Order did not provide that the Grand Master be admitted to the Order as a matter of right. While some Lords Lieutenant were in fact appointed to the Order, this seems to have been the exception rather than the rule. In 1839, Queen Victoria altered this and, though not a member during his Grand Mastership, he was permitted to retain the insignia after his term of office. The Order originally consisted of fifteen knights in addition to the Sovereign.Preamble to 1783 Statutes, quoted in Nicolas, p. 9. According to Galloway, p. 17, it was intended that there be 16 knights in addition to the Sovereign, but George III decided to take one of the 16 stalls which had been allotted in the chapel for himself. In 1821, however, George IV appointed six additional knights;Nicolas, p. 37 he did not issue a Royal Warrant authorising the change until 1830. William IV formally changed the statutes in 1833, increasing the limit to twenty-two knights.Galloway, p. 269 The original statutes, based heavily on those of the Order of the Garter, prescribed that any vacancy should be filled by the Sovereign upon the nomination of the members. Each Knight was to propose nine candidates, of whom three had to have the rank of Earl or higher, three the rank of Baron or higher, and three the rank of Knight or higher, and a vote taken. In practice this system was never used; the Grand Master would nominate a Peer, the Sovereign would usually assent, and a chapter meeting held at which the knights \\"elected\\" the new member.Galloway, p 26 The Order of St Patrick differed from its English and Scottish counterparts, the Orders of the Garter and the Thistle, in only ever appointing peers and princes. Women were never admitted to the Order of St Patrick; they were not eligible to become members of the other two orders until 1987. The only woman to be part of the Order was Queen Victoria, in her capacity as Sovereign of the Order. Although it was associated with the established Church of Ireland until 1871, several Catholics were appointed to the order throughout its history.For example The 1st Baron O'Hagan and The 4th Viscount Southwell. According to Galloway, p. 69, the first Roman Catholic was appointed to the Order in 1821. = Officers = The Order of St Patrick initially had thirteen officers: the Prelate, the Chancellor, the Registrar, the Usher, the Secretary, the Genealogist, the King of Arms, two heralds and four pursuivants.Galloway, p. 27 Many of these offices were held by clergymen of the Church of Ireland, the then-established church. After the disestablishment of the Church in 1871, the ecclesiastics were allowed to remain in office until their deaths, when the offices were either abolished or reassigned to lay officials.Warrant dated 14 July 1871, quoted in Galloway, p. 249 All offices except that of Registrar and King of Arms are now vacant. Knight of the Order of Saint Patrick The office of Prelate was held by the Lord Archbishop of Armagh, the most senior clergyman in the Church of Ireland. The Prelate was not mentioned in the original statutes, but created by a warrant shortly afterwards, apparently because the Archbishop at the time had asked to be appointed to the post.Galloway, p. 28. Since the death of the last holder in 1885, the office of Prelate has remained vacant.Galloway, pp. 249‚Äì50, 277 The Church of Ireland's second highest cleric, the Lord Archbishop of Dublin, originally served as the Chancellor of the Order. From 1886 onwards, the office was held instead by the Chief Secretary for Ireland. Since the abolition of the position of Chief Secretary in 1922, the office of Chancellor has remained vacant. The Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral was originally the Registrar of the Order. In 1890, on the death of the Dean who had held the post in at the time of disestablishment, the office was attached to that of the King of Arms of the Order. This position was held by Ulster King of Arms, Ireland's chief heraldic official, a post which had been created in 1552. In 1943, this post was in effect divided in two, reflecting the partition of Ireland in the Government of Ireland Act 1920. The position, insofar as it related to Northern Ireland, was combined with that of Norroy King of Arms (who had heraldic jurisdiction in the north of England). The post of Norroy and Ulster King of Arms still exists, and thus continues to hold the offices of Registrar and King of Arms of the Order of St Patrick. The office of Ulster King of Arms, insofar as it related to the Irish Free State (now officially called Ireland), became the position of Chief Herald of Ireland. The Order of St Patrick had six other heraldic officers, many more than any other British order. The two heralds were known as Cork Herald and Dublin Herald. Three of the four pursuivancies were untitled, the fourth was held by Athlone Pursuivant, an office founded in 1552.Galloway, pp. 27, 31 The Usher of the Order was \\"the Usher at Arms named the Black Rod\\".1783 Statutes, Article XVII, quoted in Nicolas, p. 15 The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod in Ireland was distinct from the English officer of the same name, though like his counterpart he had some duties in the Irish House of Lords.Galloway, p. 29 (The latter continues to serve as Usher to the Order of the Garter and as Serjeant-at-Arms of the House of Lords.) The Irish post has been vacant since 1933. The offices of Secretary and Genealogist were originally held by members of the Irish House of Commons. The office of Secretary has been vacant since 1926. The position of Genealogist was left vacant in 1885, restored in 1889, but left vacant again in 1930.Galloway, p. 252  Vestments and accoutrements  Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover, in the mantle of a Knight of the Order The badge of the Order. The statutes of the Order prescribed a sky-blue riband; the exact shade of blue used varied over time. For important occasions, such as Coronations and investitures of new members of the Order, Knights of St Patrick wore elaborate vestments: * The mantle was a celestial blue robe lined with white silk. The star of the Order (see below) was depicted on the left of the mantle. A blue hood was attached to the mantle.1783 Statutes, Ordinances touching the Badges, Devices and Habits of our Knights Companion of our Most Illustrious order of St Patrick, quoted in Nicholas pp. 16‚Äì17 * The hat of the Order was originally of white satin, lined with blue, but was changed to black velvet by George IV. It was plumed with three falls of feathers, one red, one white and one blue. * The collar was made of gold, consisting of Tudor roses and harps attached with knots. The two roses which comprise the Tudor rose were alternately enamelled white within red, and red within white. The central harp, from which the badge of the Order was suspended, was surmounted by a crown. On certain \\"collar days\\" designated by the Sovereign, members attending formal events wore the Order's collar over their military uniform, formal day dress, or evening wear. When collars were worn (either on collar days or on formal occasions such as coronations), the badge was suspended from the collar. Aside from these special occasions, however, much simpler accoutrements were used: * The star of the Order was an eight-pointed figure, with the four cardinal points longer than the intermediate points. Each point was shown as a cluster of rays. In the centre was the same motto, year and design that appeared on the badge. The star was worn pinned to the left breast. * The broad riband was a celestial blue sash worn across the body, from the right shoulder to the left hip.1783 Statutes, article V, quoted in Nicolas, p. 10 The sash of the Order of the Garter, similar in colour, is worn from the left shoulder. * The badge was pinned to the riband at the left hip. Made of gold, it depicted a shamrock bearing three crowns, on top of a cross of St Patrick and surrounded by a blue circle bearing the motto in majuscules, as well as the date of the Order's foundation in Roman numerals (\\"MDCCLXXXIII\\"). The Grand Master's insignia were of the same form and design as those of the Knights. In 1831, however, William IV presented the Grand Master with a star and badge, each composed of rubies, emeralds and Brazilian diamonds. These two insignia were designated \\"Crown Jewels\\" in the Order's 1905 Statutes, and the designation \\"Irish Crown Jewels\\" was emphasised by newspapers when they were stolen in 1907, along with the collars of five Knights; they have not since been recovered.Galloway, p.81 A number of items pertaining to the Order of St Patrick are held in museums in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The robes of The 4th Baron Clonbrock, the 122nd Knight of the Order, are on display in the National Museum of Ireland, Dublin; the robe belonging to The 3rd Earl of Kilmorey is held by the Newry Museum; the National Gallery and Genealogical Museum in Dublin both have Stars of the Order; and the Ulster Museum (part of the National Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland) in Stranmillis has a large collection on display and two mantles in storage. The Irish Guards take their capstar and motto from the Order.  Chapel and Chancery  St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin was the Chapel of the Order. The Chapel of the Order was originally in St Patrick's Cathedral in central Dublin.1783 Statutes, article VII, quoted in Nicolas, p. 11 Each member of the Order, including the Sovereign, was allotted a stall in the choir of the Chapel, above which his (or her, in the case of Queen Victoria) heraldic devices were displayed. Perched on the pinnacle of a knight's stall was a helm, decorated with mantling and topped by his crest. Above the crest, the knight's heraldic banner was hung, emblazoned with his coat of arms. At a considerably smaller scale, to the back of the stall was affixed a piece of brass (a \\"stall plate\\") displaying its occupant's name, arms and date of admission into the Order. Upon the death of a Knight, the banner and crest were taken down and replaced with those of his successor. After the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871, the Chapel ceased to be used; the heraldic devices of the knights at the time were left in place at the request of Queen Victoria.Galloway, p. 67 The Order was without a ceremonial home until 1881 when arrangements were made to display banners, helms and hatchment plates (the equivalent of stall plates, in the absence of stalls) in the Great Hall, officially called St. Patrick's Hall, in Dublin Castle.Galloway, p. 70 On the establishment of the Irish Free State the banners of the living knights were removed. When the Hall was redecorated in 1962 it was decided that it should be hung with the banners of the members of the Order in 1922. The existing banners were repaired or new ones made; it is these banners which can be seen today.Galloway, p. 202 The Hall, which was renamed St Patrick's Hall from its association with the Order, also served as the Chancery of the Order. Installation ceremonies, and later investitures, were held here, often on St Patrick's Day, until they were discontinued. A banquet for the Knights was often held in the Hall on the occasion of an installation. St Patrick's Hall now serves as the location for the inauguration of the President of Ireland. If an incumbent Irish president dies in office (such as Erskine Hamilton Childers in 1974), he lies in state in the hall. Unlike many of the other British Orders, the stall plates (or hatchment plates) do not form a continuous record of the Knights of the Order. There are only 34 stall plates for the 80 or so knights appointed before 1871, (although others were destroyed in a fire in 1940), and 40 hatchments plates for the 60 knights appointed subsequently. In the case of the stall plates this was perhaps due to their size, 30x36 cm (12x14 in).Galloway, pp. 201‚Äì209  Precedence and privileges  A panel recording some members of the Order of St Patrick in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. Since the members of the Order were required to be knights, and in practice had higher rank, many of the privileges of membership were rendered moot. As knights they could prefix \\"Sir\\" to their forenames, but the form was never used in speech, as they were referred to by their peerage dignities. They were assigned positions in the order of precedence, but had higher positions by virtue of their peerage dignities. Knights used the post-nominal letters \\"KP\\". When an individual was entitled to use multiple post-nominal letters, KP appeared before all others, except \\"Bt\\" and \\"Btss\\" (Baronet and Baronetess), \\"VC\\" (Victoria Cross), \\"GC\\" (George Cross), \\"KG\\" (Knight of the Garter) and \\"KT\\" (Knight of the Thistle). Knights could encircle their arms with a depiction of the circlet (a blue circle bearing the motto) and the collar; the former is shown either outside or on top of the latter. The badge is depicted suspended from the collar.The 1783 statutes only mention encircling the arms with the collar and badge of the Order. The 1905 Statutes, article XX (quoted in Galloway, p. 282) mention the circlet and supporters as well. They were also entitled to receive heraldic supporters.1905 Statutes, article XXI, quoted in Galloway, p 282 This high privilege was, and is, only shared by members of the Royal Family, peers, Knights and Ladies of the Garter, Knights and Ladies of the Thistle, and Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the junior orders. (Of course, Knights of St Patrick, normally all being members of the British Royal Family or peers, were mostly entitled to supporters in any event.)Woodcock and Robinson, p 93  See also  * List of Knights of St Patrick  Notes   References    * The National Cathedral and Collegiate Church of Saint Patrick.

The oldest part of the building was built in 1886. The large building formerly housed tax offices and was occupied in 1980. When the local council took over the ownership of the building, it was agreed to renovate it in three stages, with the squatters living there. However the plans changed and since 1995 the council decided to widen the roads next to the building; for this reason the squat needed to be demolished. After many efforts to block the demolition with lawsuits, the squatters were evicted by military police on 3 October, 2003. Occupation With the Dutch squatters movement regularly in the news for events such as the Vondelstraat eviction resistance and the Amsterdam coronation riots, De Blauwe Aanslag was occupied in 1980. The owner, the Dutch state, tried to evict the Squatting in the Netherlands squatters by turning off the electricity but eventually sold the building to the Hague council. At first, the council was more conciliatory in approach and in 1986 agreed with the squatters that the building should be protected. However, by the mid1990s, the council had decided that the building needed to be demolished in order to widen the road at its front, the Buitenom. Name In English, the name De Blauwe Aanslag means 'The Blue Attack' and refers to the blue envelopes in which the Dutch tax administration sends its mail, since the building was formerly a tax office. Activities De Blauwe Aanslag in 2002 De Blauwe Aanslag housed 200 people. The building contained a cinema, a concert venue and a restaurant. A magazine called de Schijnbeweging was published from the building. It was the first home of Radio Tonka, an ongoing free radio project. The Bunker record label came out of parties at De Blauwe Aanslag, releasing artists like Legowelt and Unit Moebius. Eviction De Blauwe Aanslag was evicted on 3 October, 2003, with an operation of 450 riot police. Ninety people were arrested. After the final legal challenges failed when the permissions for the eviction and demolition orders were judged to be in order, two police water cannons were used to force the squatters on the roof to go back inside. Then a shipping container full of police was lifted to the roof with a crane, so that they could gain entry to the building. Later a JCB was driven into a side entrance in order to gain access at ground level. De Grote Pyr The inhabitants of De Blauwe Aanslag were offered the opportunity by the Hague council to buy an old school on Waldeck Pyrmontkade and renovate it. This then became De Grote Pyr. Recent developments In 2013, ten years after De Blauwe Aanslag had been evicted and demolished, Joris Wijsmuller from the Haagse Stadspartij (a political party in the Hague) asked the council why the ground had still not been built on. He suggested it would be good to give it to the people of the Hague for new initiatives.

His biggest career hit song, \\"Walking the Floor Over You\\" (1941), marked the rise of the honky tonk style of music. In 1948, he was the first singer to record a hit version of Billy Hayes and Jay W. Johnson's \\"Blue Christmas\\", a song more commonly associated with Elvis Presley and his late-1950s version. Another well-known Tubb hit was \\"Waltz Across Texas\\" (1965) (written by his nephew Quanah Talmadge Tubb, known professionally as Billy Talmadge), which became one of his most requested songs and is often used in dance halls throughout Texas during waltz lessons. Tubb recorded duets with the then up-and-coming Loretta Lynn in the early 1960s, including their hit \\"Sweet Thang\\". Tubb is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame. Biography =Early years= Tubb was born on a cotton farm near Crisp, in Ellis County, Texas (now a ghost town). His father was a sharecropper, so Tubb spent his youth working on farms throughout the state. He was inspired by Jimmie Rodgers and spent his spare time learning to sing, yodel, and play the guitar. At age 19, he took a job as a singer on San Antonio radio station KONO-AM. The pay was low, so Tubb also dug ditches for the Works Progress Administration and then clerked at a drug store. In 1939, he moved to San Angelo, Texas, and was hired to do a 15-minute afternoon live show on radio station KGKL-AM. He drove a beer delivery truck to support himself during this time, and during World War II, he wrote and recorded a song titled \\"Beautiful San Angelo\\". =Recording career= In 1936, Tubb contacted Jimmie Rodgers' widow (Rodgers died in 1933) to ask for an autographed photo. A friendship developed and she was instrumental in getting Tubb a recording contract with RCA. His first two records were unsuccessful. A tonsillectomy in 1939 affected his singing style, so he turned to songwriting. In 1940, he switched to Decca Records to try singing again, and his sixth Decca release with the single \\"Walking the Floor Over You\\" brought Tubb to stardom. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc in 1965 by the Recording Industry Association of America. Tubb (third from left, back row) at Carnegie Hall in 1947 Tubb joined the Grand Ole Opry in February 1943 and put together his band, the Texas Troubadours.Pugh, Ronnie. Ernest Tubb: The Texas Troubadour, p. 84 Tubb's first band members were from Gadsden, Alabama. They were: Vernon \\"Toby\\" Reese, Chester Studdard, and Ray \\"Kemo\\" Head. He remained a regular on the radio show for four decades, and hosted his own Midnite Jamboree radio show each Saturday night after the Opry. Tubb headlined the first Grand Ole Opry show presented in Carnegie Hall in New York City in September 1947. Tubb always surrounded himself with some of Nashville's best musicians. Jimmy Short, his first guitarist in the Troubadours, is credited with the Tubb sound of single-string guitar picking. From about 1943 to 1948, Short featured clean, clear riffs throughout Tubb's songs. Other well-known musicians to either travel with Tubb as band members or record on his records were steel guitarist Jerry Byrd and Tommy \\"Butterball\\" Paige, who replaced Short as Tubb's lead guitarist in 1947. Billy Byrd joined the Troubadours in 1949 and brought jazzy riffs to the instrumental interludes, especially the four-note riff at the end of his guitar solos that would become synonymous with Tubb's songs. A jazz musician, Byrd ‚Äî no relation to Jerry ‚Äî remained with Tubb until 1959. Another Tubb musician was actually his producer, Owen Bradley. Bradley played piano on many of Tubb's recordings from the 1950s, but Tubb wanted him to sound like Moon Mullican, the honky-tonk piano great of that era. The classically trained Bradley tried, but could not quite match the sound, so Tubb said Bradley was \\"half as good\\" as Moon. When Tubb called out Bradley's name at the start of one of the piano interludes, the singer always referred to him as \\"Half-Moon Bradley\\". In 1949, Tubb helped the famed boogie-woogie Andrews Sisters crossover to the country charts when they teamed on Decca Records to record a cover of Eddy Arnold's \\"Don't Rob Another Man's Castle\\" and the Western swing-flavored \\"I'm Bitin' My Fingernails and Thinking of You\\". Tubb was impressed by the enormous success of Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne Andrews, and he remembered that their 1947 recording of \\"The Blue Tail Fly (Jimmy Crack Corn)\\" with folk legend Burl Ives produced a top-10 Billboard hit,Sforza, John: \\"Swing It! The Andrews Sisters Story;\\" University Press of Kentucky, 2000; 289 pages and he was then eager to repeat that success. He brought the upbeat \\"Fingernails\\" tune to the session, hoping that the trio would like it, and they did. Not realizing how tall the Texas Troubadour was, the recording technicians at Decca had the sisters stand on a wooden box on one side of the one microphone they shared with Tubb so the audio would balance. The rhythm trio also was not used to Tubb's vocal style, as Maxene once remembered, \\"He sang different than anybody I've ever heard. He sang the melody of the song, but the timing was different. It wasn't like we were used to...you sing eight bars, and then you sing eight bars, and then you sing eight bars. Not with him. He just sang eight bars, ten bars, eleven bars, and then stopped, whatever it was. So, we'd just start to follow him, and then got paid on 750,000 records sold that never came above the Mason-Dixon Line!\\" Cover art for the album On Tour by Ernest Tubb Tubb never possessed the best voice: he always sang flat, and actually mocked his own singing. He told an interviewer that 95% of the men in bars would hear his music on the juke box and say to their girlfriends, \\"I can sing better than him,\\" and Tubb added they would be right. In fact, he missed some notes horribly on some recordings. When Tubb was recording \\"You Don't Have to Be a Baby to Cry\\" in 1949 and tried to hit a low note, Red Foley, his duet partner at the time, was sitting in the booth when somebody said, \\"I bet you wish you could hit that low note.\\" Foley replied, \\"I bet Ernest wishes he could hit that note.\\" The two, who released seven albums together, maintained a friendly on-air \\"feud\\" over the years, and Tubb appeared on Foley's Ozark Jubilee on ABC-TV. In 1957, he walked into the lobby of the National Life Building in Nashville and fired a .357 magnum, intending to shoot music producer Jim Denny. Tubb shot at the wrong man, but did not hit anyone. He was arrested and charged with public drunkenness.Cusic, Don Eddy Arnold: I'll Hold You in My Heart (1997), Rutledge Hill Press, , p. 137 In the 1960s, Tubb was well known for having one of the best bands in country music history. The band included lightning-fingered Leon Rhodes (1932‚Äì2017), who later appeared on TV's Hee Haw as the guitarist in the show's band. Buddy Emmons, another pedal-steel guitar virtuoso, began with Tubb in fall of 1957 and lasted through the early 1960s. Emmons went on to create a steel-guitar manufacturing company that bears his name. Buddy Charleton, one of the most accomplished pedal-steel guitarists known, joined Ernest in spring 1962 and continued to fall of 1973. Buddy Charleton and Leon Rhodes formed a nucleus for the Texas Troubadours that would be unsurpassed. Beginning in the fall of 1965, he hosted a half-hour TV program, The Ernest Tubb Show, which aired in first-run syndication for three years.Gross, Mike \\"Country Television Programs Enjoying Coast-to-Coast Hayride\\" (November 13, 1965) Billboard, p.1 That same year, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, and in 1970, Tubb was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.Country Music Association Hall of Fame list of members.

He remained, as did most of his peers, a fixture at the Grand Ole Opry, where he continued to appear. He continued to host his Midnite Jamboree radio program a few blocks away from the Opry at his record shop. A notable release in 1979, The Legend and the Legacy, paired Tubb with a who's who of country singers on the Cachet Records label, to which Tubb was connected financially. This long out-of-print duets album was re-released in 1999 as a CD on the First Generations label, on the 20th anniversary of its release, and it quickly went out of print again. In 1980, he appeared as himself in Loretta Lynn's autobiographical film, Coal Miner's Daughter with Roy Acuff and Minnie Pearl. His singing voice remained intact until late in life, when he fell ill with emphysema. Even so, he continued to make over 200 personal appearances a year, carrying an oxygen tank on his bus. After each performance, he would shake hands and sign autographs with every fan who wanted to stay. Health problems finally halted his performances in 1982. \\"Ernest Tubb\\" Texas Country Music Hall of Fame ; retrieved March 20, 2011. Death On August 15, 1982, he made his final appearance on the Grand Ole Opry. He died in 1984 at the Baptist Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee, from emphysema. He is buried in Nashville's Hermitage Memorial Gardens. Legacy Tubb was inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame in 1999, and he ranked number 21 in CMT's 40 Greatest Men of Country Music in 2003. One of his sons, Justin, was a popular country singer and songwriter in the mid-1950s through the early 1960s; Justin's sons, Carey and Zachary Tubb, also became musicians. Tubb's nephew, Billy Lee Tubb, was his lead guitarist briefly (fall 1959 ‚Äì April 1960). He also had solo careers under several pseudonyms (Ronny Wade, X. Lincoln) and played with John Anderson, writing several songs with him.Pugh, Ronnie. Ernest Tubb: The Texas Troubadour, pg. 240 Tubb's great nephew, Lucky Tubb, has toured with Hank Williams III. Cal Smith, who played guitar for the Texas Troubadours during the 1960s, went on to a successful country music career of his own in the 1970s, recording hits such as \\"Country Bumpkin\\". Jack Greene, who played drums for the Texas Troubadours, went on to become a successful country music star following his departure from Tubb's band, recording the hits \\"There Goes My Everything\\" and \\"Statue of a Fool\\". Ernest Tubb's nephew, Glenn Douglas Tubb, wrote his first hit song for his uncle in 1952. He then went on to write more than 50 hit songs for more than two dozen country and rock music superstars, including Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, BJ Thomas, George Jones, Kentucky Headhunters, Charlie Pride, Ann Murray, and Kitty Wells. Glenn won a Grammy Award for \\"Skip a Rope,\\" made a hit by Henson Cargill. He currently performs \\"The Ernest Tubb Tribute Show\\" in theaters across the U.S. The Midnite Jamboree Tubb founded in 1947 continues to air, recorded each weekend from a stage at his record shop and airing after each episode of the Grand Ole Opry. The song \\"Set 'Em Up Joe\\", recorded and made famous by Vern Gosdin, was a tribute to Tubb's music, particularly the song \\"Walking the Floor Over You\\". The Ernest Tubb Record Store, founded in 1947, is still in operation in Nashville. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Ernest Tubb among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

Woodvale was constructed as an all-weather night fighter airfield for the defence of Liverpool. However, it did not open until 7 December 1941 which was just after the Liverpool Blitz which peaked in May of that year. History =The Second World War= During the Second World War RAF squadrons were brought up from the south of England to 'rest' for short periods, during which time they defended Merseyside. 308 (Krakowski) Squadron was the first to arrive, on 12 December 1941, from RAF Northolt before leaving on 1 April 1942. Squadrons were rotated regularly. Several were Polish, including 315 (Dƒôblinski) Sqn and 317 (Wilenski) Sqn. Spitfire IIs and Vbs were operated by these units. Support units working with all three Services also served there, calibrating anti-aircraft guns and towing targets for the Royal Navy. In April 1945, Woodvale briefly became a Tender for the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm airfield at Burscough, HMS Ringtail, being given the name HMS Ringtail II. =Post war= 10 AEF Grob Tutor and hangar at RAF Woodvale. After a period of inactivity, Woodvale reopened on 22 July 1946, when the Spitfire F14s of No. 611 (West Lancashire) Squadron, Royal Auxiliary Air Force, moved here from Liverpool Airport at Speke. The squadron re- equipped with Spitfire F22s in February 1949. Gloster Meteor F.4 and F.8 jets were flown between May 1951 until 9 July 1951. Because of the need for better facilities, the Squadron moved to RAF Hooton Park, joining No. 610 Squadron, where it remained until its disbandment on 10 March 1957. The Temperature and Humidity Flight, operating Spitfires and Mosquitos, was based there from 1953 to 1958. The last operational flight by a Spitfire in active British military markings, flew from RAF Woodvale in 1957. No. 5 Civilian Anti-Aircraft Co- Operation Unit moved to Woodvale on 1 January 1958, and operated target-towing Meteors until 30 September 1971 when the unit was disbanded. =Training station= Since 1971, RAF Woodvale has remained a training station. Liverpool University Air Squadron- LUAS moved in from RAF Hooton Park on 2 July 1951. Manchester and Salford University Air Squadron (then named Manchester University Air Squadron) (MUAS) (now MASUAS) moved in from Manchester's Barton Aerodrome in March 1953. 10 Air Experience Flight was formed at RAF Woodvale on 25 August 1958 and 631 Volunteer Gliding Squadron moved in from RAF Sealand in March 2006. The current station commander is Wing Commander D Hooton. A BAe Hawk T1A, number XX247, was installed as the site's gate guardian in November 2017, replacing an earlier Jet Provost.

Merseyside Police Air Support Group Basing the Merseyside Air Support Group at RAF Woodvale made the station something of a target for criminals. Just before 2230 on Friday 9 October 2009 a window of the helicopter was smashed and petrol poured inside causing the helicopter to be grounded. On 17 May 2010 the Merseyside Police helicopter was again attacked and grounded, after four masked intruders broke into the airbase at around 04:00 causing what was described as minor damage. As part of the reorganisation of Police Air Support in England and Wales and the formation of the National Police Air Service, Merseyside operationally retired its dedicated Police helicopter G-XMII in July 2011. Cover would then be provided with four aircraft from Cheshire, Lancashire, North Wales and Greater Manchester, the nearest to Merseyside being based at Hawarden Airport with G-XMII providing back up. From 1 June 2012, Merseyside Police signed a four- year deal to lease the helicopter to the Norwegian Police Service in response to the 2011 terrorist attacks in Norway.

It is of medieval origin and was rebuilt in 1712‚Äì1714 to the designs of Nicholas Hawksmoor. Early history The church is dedicated to Alfege (also spelt \\"Alphege\\"), Archbishop of Canterbury, and reputedly marks the place where he was martyred on 19 April 1012, having been taken prisoner during the sack of Canterbury by Danish raiders the previous year. The Danes took him to their camp at Greenwich and killed him when the large ransom they demanded was not forthcoming. Accessed 5 July 2017 The church was rebuilt in around 1290, and Henry VIII was baptised there in 1491. The patronage of the church was given to the abbey at Ghent during the 13th century. Following the suppression of alien priories under Henry V, it was granted to the priory at Sheen with which it remained until transferred to the Crown by exchange under Henry VIII in 1530. During a storm in 1710 the medieval church collapsed, its foundations having been weakened by burials both inside and outside. The present church Interior view Following the collapse of the medieval church, the present building was constructed, funded by a grant from the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches, to the designs of Nicholas Hawksmoor, one of the commission's two surveyors. The first church to be built by the commissioners, it was begun in 1712 and basic construction was completed in 1714; it was not, however, consecrated until 1718. The church is rectangular in plan with a flat ceiling and a small apse serving as a chancel. The east front, towards the street, has a portico in the Tuscan order, with a central arch cutting through the entablature and pediment‚Äîa motif used in Wren's \\"Great Model\\" for St Paul's Cathedral. A giant order of pilasters runs around the rest of the church, a feature Kerry Downes suggests may have been added by Thomas Archer, who, according to the minutes of the commission, \\"improved\\" Hawksmoor's plans. On the north and south sides of the churchwide projecting vestibules rise to the full height of the building, with steps leading up to the doors. Hawksmoor planned a west tower, in the position of the existing one, which had survived the collapse. However the commission was reluctant to fund it, and the medieval tower was retained. In 1730 John James refaced it, and added a spire. Hawksmoor's design, published in an engraving in 1714, had an octagonal lantern at the top, a motif he was later to use at St George in the East. An organ, built by George England, was installed in the mid-18th century. The crypt served as an air-raid shelter during World War II. During the Blitz on 19 March 1941, incendiary bombs landed on the roof causing it to collapse, burning into the nave. The walls and the tower remained standing but much of the interior was gutted. The church was restored by Sir Albert Richardson in 1953. In 2015 a fund-raising cream tea garden party for Christian Aid, held in the churchyard after the Sunday sermon, was stormed by armed police. An attendee said that the vicar's wife was ‚Äúalmost knocked over by a policeman with a huge machine gun‚Äù, but ‚Äúpeople just carried on drinking their tea‚Äù in a display of typical British fortitude even though ‚Äúall these armed police bursting in was like the film Hot Fuzz‚Äù. The police proceeded to the adjacent Saint Alfege Park, where a man was arrested and a firearm found. The Church is currently used to celebrate \\"Founder's Day\\" of Addey and Stanhope School and The John Roan School. Notables buried here Pinkie by Thomas Lawrence. Huntington Library, California. Notable people buried in and around the church include the Renaissance choirmaster and composer William Newark (died 1509, no surviving memorial), the composer Thomas Tallis (died 1585), the merchant Sir John Lethieullier (died 1719) on the outer south-west corner of the church, the English-born explorer of Canada Henry Kelsey (died 1724), General James Wolfe, the victor over the French in Canada but who died in the process at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in 1759, the actress Lavinia Fenton (died 1760), and the MP Sir James Creed (died 1762) against the outer north wall.'Greenwich: The parish church', Old and New London: Volume 6 (1878), pp. 190‚Äì205 Accessed 26 May 2007. Sarah Barrett Moulton, the Jamaican- born schoolgirl (1783-1795) who was the subject of the celebrated painting Pinkie (shown at right), was buried in the church after dying aged twelve, just a year after her portrait had been painted. The merchant, Lloyd's underwriter and art collector John Julius Angerstein (died 1823), who was a churchwarden in the early 19th century, is also buried here. Literary connection In Charles Dickens's novel Our Mutual Friend, Bella Wilfer marries John Rokesmith in St Alfege Church. In Tom McCarthy's novel C, after a Marinettiesque car crash, Serge Carrefax laughs from his position within the upturned chassis.

It first flew in 1945. As an early jet fighter, its limitations included a lack of power and it was soon eclipsed by more advanced designs. Design and development The early jet fighters consumed fuel at a prodigious rate which severely limited their range and endurance. In March 1944, the United States Army Air Forces requested Bell to design a fighter with increased endurance and formally awarded a contract for two prototypes on 31 July 1944. Bell had been working on its \\"Model 40\\" interceptor design since 1943. It was redesigned as a long- range escort fighter while retaining the general layout of the P-59 Airacomet. The two General Electric J33-GE-5 turbojet engines were located in each wing root which left the large and bulky fuselage free for fuel tanks and armament. The fuselage was an all-metal semimonocoque capable of carrying 1,150 gal (4,350 l) of fuel. In addition, two 250 gal (950 l) drop tanks could be carried. The cabin was pressurized and used a small and low bubble style canopy. The armament was to be six 0.5 in (12.7 mm) machine guns in the nose. Testing Early wind tunnel reports had pinpointed directional instability but the \\"fix\\" of a larger tail would not be ready in time for flight testing.Koehnen 1982, p. 24. The first prototype was flown on 25 February 1945, by Bell's chief test pilot, Jack Woolams, who found it to be under- powered and unstable. The limited flight testing provided satisfactory flight characteristics although spins were restricted until the larger tail fin was installed. The second prototype did incorporate the extended tail and an aileron boost system.Koehnen 1982, pp. 44, 48. One unique characteristic was the XP-83's refusal to slow down due to its sleek aerodynamic shape and lack of drag brakes. This meant that test pilots were forced to fly \\"stabilized approaches\\" (i.e. very long and flat landing approaches).Koehnen 1982, p. 48. The first prototype was used in 1946 as a ramjet test-bed with an engineer's station located in the fuselage behind the pilot. On 14 September 1946, one of the ramjets caught fire forcing pilot, \\"Slick\\" Goodlin and engineer Charles Fay, to bail out. The second prototype flew on 19 October and was later scrapped in 1947. Apart from range, the XP-83 was inferior to the Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star and this led to the cancellation of the XP-83 project in 1947.

It runs northeast/southwest through the cities of Kitchener and Waterloo, and is connected to Highway 401 via the Highway 8 Freeport Diversion and King Street East. The name \\"Conestoga Parkway\\" is not a formal designation, but rather a local name applied to the divided expressway portions of Highway 7, Highway 8 and Highway 85 through Kitchener and Waterloo. When the parkway opened in the late 1960s there were a few large green and white signs reading \\"Conestoga Parkway\\" with a picture of a Conestoga wagon on them located along the parkway. By the 1990s after several sections of the parkway had undergone reconstruction and expansion, these signs had been removed but many maps still show this as the name of the freeway. Most residents of Kitchener and Waterloo refer to the parkway as \\"The Expressway\\". By contrast, the portion of Highway 8 which departs from the parkway at King Street East in Kitchener and runs to Highway 401 is often referred to as the Freeport Diversion, \\"Highway 8 Expressway\\" or \\"King Street Bypass\\" by local residents.  Route description  Highway 85 facing south at the northern end of the Conestoga Parkway The multiplex of Highway 7 and Highway 8 enters the city of Kitchener as a controlled-access freeway from the west; it takes on the name Conestoga Parkway at the Trussler Road exit at the western edge of the city. The Parkway (and the multiplex) continues east until Highway 8 (the Freeport Diversion) branches off toward the southeast via an interchange. At this point, the Conestoga Parkway turns northward and becomes Highway 7\\\\. At the Victoria Street exit, the Parkway sheds the Highway 7 designation and becomes Highway 85 (its original designation, before it was made part of Highway 86 from the early 1980s to the latter‚Äôs decommissioning on May 1, 2003). It continues through the city of Waterloo towards St. Jacobs, where the freeway alignment ends and becomes Regional Road 85, or Arthur Street South. Note that the Parkway is merely a controlled-access portion of the three numbered highways, two of which (Highway 7 and Highway 8) continue for some distance beyond the freeway referred to as the Conestoga Parkway. Thus, the freeway has the distinction of being one of the few Ontario- maintained freeways not numbered according to the 400-Series Highway network, even though it is busier and wider than many rural 400-series highways, because the freeway upgrade has joined together only parts of existing routes. In comparison, the 400-series highways are intended to be full freeways for their entire length. The speed limit on the Conestoga Parkway is 90 km/h (55 mph). From its completion in the late 1960s its speed limit was 100 km/h, but the limit was lowered in the late 1990s due to collisions across the grass median (since replaced with Ontario tall-wall). Highway 7/8 between Courtland Avenue and Fischer-Hallman Road has an abnormally narrow median, and overpasses are single structures with simple curbs as median dividers instead of the usual Jersey barrier or Ontario tall-wall. The portion of Highway 7/8 (from Trussler Road to Wilmot Centre Road/Foundry Street) which was converted into a freeway in the 1990s does not have this deficiency, nor do the portions of the Parkway signed as Highways 7 and 85\\\\.  History  The Conestoga Parkway facing northbound at the Kitchener‚ÄìWaterloo boundary The Conestoga Parkway meanders through Kitchener-Waterloo The parkway is one of the busiest roads in the region. It was completed as a four-lane freeway in the late 1960s, with the exception of the short eight-lane collector‚Äìexpress system serving Highway 7/Victoria Street and Wellington Street. Mainline traffic on Highway 8 could continue under the Conestoga, where the route defaults to King Street, to enter downtown Kitchener. The Conestoga east/north of this junction serves as a bypass of King Street. At the time, the Conestoga Parkway and Highway 8 Freeport Diversion freeways were isolated from the 400-series highway network, as the Freeport Diversion ended at an at-grade Y-junction with King Street East. Traffic from the Freeport Diversion was treated as the mainline traffic at this interchange and King East continued to a cloverleaf interchange with Highway 401\\\\. A direct freeway connection between Highway 401 and the Conestoga was made possible when a new bypass (designated as Highway 7187, but signed with Highway 8 and Highway 401 trailblazers, and later made part of Highway 8) was opened in 1987; it featured a Y-junction with Highway 401 to serve traffic east of that junction. The cloverleaf interchange with the existing Highway 8 had several ramps realigned, and it continues to serve traffic from eastbound Highway 401\\\\. There remains no direct freeway connection to Highway 8 from Highway 401 westbound. Drivers wishing to travel from Kitchener-Waterloo onto Highway 401 Westbound (London) are required to divert onto \\"old Highway 8\\", through several sets of traffic lights, causing considerable traffic congestion. In 1993, a four-lane extension to Baden was opened, linking up with an existing undivided four-lane expressway at New Hamburg. Interchange between Conestoga Parkway and Freeport Diversion Since the late 1990s, the Conestoga has undergone extensive reconstruction between Courtland Avenue and Lancaster Street, with the addition of an Ontario \\"tall- wall\\" concrete median barrier and high-mast lighting replacing the conventional mercury truss lights. The widening project resulted that stretch of the Parkway being expanded to at least six lanes by using the grass median, and eight lanes between Highway 8 and a location midway between Ottawa and Frederick Streets (north of that location was already eight lanes) by using the right-of-way afforded by the shoulders. In 2004, extensive improvements were completed around the former obsolete and bottlenecked \\"half-cloverleaf\\" junction with the freeway section of Highway 8, that links it to Highway 401. This included a new flyover semi-directional ramp from Conestoga westbound to Highway 8 eastbound, while the ramp in the opposite direction was realigned to allow it to carry two lanes of traffic at a higher speed. Starting in 2013, the section running from just east of Courtland Avenue to just west of Fischer-Hallman Road has undergone widening and upgrading. Replacement of the Westmount Road overpass and a rebuild of the Fischer-Hallman interchange happened in the first year; the remainder is set to be completed by 2015. In addition to the proposed Highway 7 freeway between Kitchener and Guelph (see below), the Ministry of Transportation has long term plans to widen and reroute Highway 7/8 westward to Stratford. How this will affect the village of Shakespeare, which the open highway currently bisects, is an issue of some concern. = Highway 7 freeway to Guelph = The collector‚Äìexpress section of the Conestoga serving the interchanges with Highway 7/Victoria Street and Wellington Street There is a stark difference between the congested, inefficient exit for Highway 7/Victoria Street, and the high-capacity but underused Wellington Street exit just north of it, both which are served by the short collector‚Äìexpress system on the Conestoga Parkway. This is due to the expectation that Highway 7 would be redirected as a controlled-access highway that would link up Conestoga Parkway and Hanlon Parkway, bypassing Victoria Street, connecting to the Conestoga via a 4-level interchange (a rarity outside of the Greater Toronto Area) to be built over the existing Wellington Street parclo junction. However, these plans have languished for over 30 years and were still in the planning stages .http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/highway-7-kitchener-guelph- completion-2021-1.4278937 Opposition has arisen due to the new alignment of this Highway 7 freeway passing through environmentally sensitive lands. In particular, the 4-level interchange's $25 million cost represents a quarter of the projected $100 million budget for the total Highway 7 project, with the high cost partly due to the difficulty in land acquisition to accommodate the flyover ramps.https://urbantoronto.ca/forum/attachments/attachment- png.105449/https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7540630-new-highway-7-delayed- again-as-28-years-of-planning-drags-on/https://guelph.ca/wp- content/uploads/Victoria-St.-Report.pdf The Victoria Street overpass was demolished on February 23‚Äì24, 2018, and was replaced with a new structure that reopened to traffic on October 28, 2018; the new bridge is longer and has a higher elevation to accommodate the future ramps between Highway 7 and the Conestoga.https://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/victoria-street-bridge-gone-conestoga- parkway-open-1.3818243https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener- waterloo/victoria-street-bridge-kitchener-reopens-1.4877660  Exit list   See also  *List of Ontario expressways *400-series highways  External links  *Timelapse driving video of the Conestoga Parkway  References  Category:Roads in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo Category:Ontario provincial highways Category:Transport in Kitchener, Ontario Category:Transport in Waterloo, Ontario ","title":"Conestoga Parkway"},{"id":"333812","text":"Underdog is an American animated television series that ran from October 3, 1964, to March 4, 1967 (dead link) starting on the NBC network until 1966, with the rest of the run on CBS, under the primary sponsorship of General Mills, for a run of 62 episodes. The show continued in syndication until 1973. Underdog, Shoeshine Boy's heroic alter ego, appears whenever love interest Sweet Polly Purebred is being victimized by such villains as Simon Bar Sinister or Riff Raff. Underdog nearly always speaks in rhyming couplets, as in \\"There's no need to fear, Underdog is here!\\" His voice was supplied by Wally Cox. History In 1959, handling the General Mills account as an account executive with the Dancer Fitzgerald Sample advertising agency in New York, W. Watts Biggers teamed with Chet Stover, Treadwell D. Covington, and artist Joe Harris in the creation of television cartoon shows to sell breakfast cereals for General Mills. The shows introduced such characters as King Leonardo, Tennessee Tuxedo, and Underdog. Biggers and Stover contributed both scripts and songs to the series. When Underdog became a success, Biggers and his partners left Dancer Fitzgerald Sample to form their own company, Total Television, with animation produced at Gamma Studios in Mexico. In 1969, Total Television folded when General Mills dropped out as the primary sponsor (but continued to retain the rights to the series until 1995; however, they still own TV distribution rights through NBCUniversal Television Distribution). =Abroad and in syndication= The syndicated version of The Underdog Show consists of 62 half-hour episodes. The supporting segments differ from the show's original network run. The first 26 syndicated episodes feature Tennessee Tuxedo as a supporting segment. (Tennessee Tuxedo originally aired as a separate show and also has its own syndicated adaptation.) Thereafter, for most of the balance of the package, the middle segments include Go Go Gophers and Klondike Kat for three consecutive half-hours and Tennessee Tuxedo in the fourth. Commander McBragg is featured in the majority of episodes, replaced by three segments of The Sing-A-Long Family (in shows one-three, 28-30, and 55-57). The final two syndicated Underdog half-hours feature two one-shot cartoons that were originally part of an unsold pilot for a projected 1966 series, The Champion (Cauliflower Cabbie and Gene Hattree), with Commander McBragg appearing in show 61 and Go Go Gophers in show 62. The syndicated series, as shown in the United States, is a potpourri of segments from previously aired versions of the show. Prior to a 1994 remaster, each episode included a \\"teaser\\" at the top of the show, asking viewers to stay tuned for a clip from \\"today's four-part story.\\" (This originates from a 1969‚Äì1973 NBC Saturday morning rerun version of the show.) However, never more than two parts of the Underdog stories were ever shown in any half-hour program. Prints of such would either be followed by a closing and credits or no credits at all. The closing (which showed the first portion of a variation of the Underdog theme showing a giant terrorizing the city with George S. Irving, the series narrator, saying, \\"Looks like this is the end! But don't miss our next Underdog Show!\\" in place of the theme music) followed by the end credits (re-edited from the cast credits for Underdog and Tennessee Tuxedo), originated from a 1965 repackaged syndicated series, Cartoon Cut-Ups, which originally featured Underdog, Tennessee Tuxedo, and Commander McBragg. For many years starting with NBC's last run in the mid-1970s, all references to Underdog swallowing his Super Energy Pill were censored, most likely out of fear that kids would see medication that looked like the Underdog pills (red with a white \\"U\\" on them) and swallow them. Two instances that did not actually show Underdog swallowing the pills remained in the show. In one, he drops pills into water supplies; in the other, his ring is damaged and he explains that it is where he keeps the pill‚Äîbut the part where he actually swallows it was still deleted. Most stories had multiple parts, but the first four were stand-alones: * \\"Safe Waif\\", the pilot, featured a rescue from a bank vault, but no villain. Underdog is shown causing major destruction while trying to help people. * \\"March of the Monsters\\", the first appearance of Sweet Polly Purebred, has giant robots running amok. * \\"Simon Says\\" is the first appearance of Simon Bar Sinister. \\"Simon says HOLD IT!\\" is the maniacal refrain, as Bar Sinister uses a weird camera to turn his victims into full- sized, two-dimensional photographs. * \\"Tricky Trap by Tap Tap\\" is the epilogue to the multi-part story \\"From Hopeless to Helpless\\" featuring Riff Raff. The show aired on Nickelodeon from June 1992 until the mid 1990s. Underdog also aired on Australian Broadcasting Corporation on February 18, 1966. In 1995, Biggers, Stover, Covington, and Harris (with General Mills) negotiated a sale of their creations to Saturday Night Live producer Lorne Michaels' Broadway Video, who later sold the rights to Golden Books. When Classic Media took over Golden Books, it acquired the underlying rights to Underdog. In 2012, Classic Media was sold to DreamWorks Animation, and ultimately became the property of the series' current owners, Universal Television. TV Guide ranked Underdog as number 23 on its \\"50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time\\" list, IGN ranked it as number 74 on its Best 100 Animated Series list. Characters Underdog was an anthropomorphic dog superhero. The premise was that \\"humble and lovable\\" Shoeshine Boy was in truth the superhero Underdog. George S. Irving narrated and comedy actor Wally Cox provided the voices of both Underdog and Shoeshine Boy. When villains threatened, Shoeshine Boy ducked into a telephone booth, where he transformed into the caped and costumed hero, destroying the booth in the process when his superpowers were activated. Underdog almost always spoke in rhyme: :\\"When Polly's in trouble (or When help is needed), I am not slow, :It's hip-hip-hip and AWAY I GO!!!\\" Underdog's most frequent saying when he appeared was: :\\"There's no need to fear-- :Underdog is here!\\" The majority of episodes used a common template as the final scene. A crowd of people looking up into the sky would say, \\"Look in the sky!\\" \\"It's a plane!\\" \\"It's a bird!\\" After this, a woman wearing glasses would exclaim, \\"It's a frog!\\" Another onlooker would respond, \\"A frog?\\" To this, Underdog replied with these words: :\\"Not plane, nor bird, nor even frog, :It's just little old me ... [at this point, Underdog would crash into something, then sheepishly finish] \\"Heh-heh-heh. Underdog.\\" Underdog usually caused collateral damage. Whenever someone complained about the damage, Underdog replied: :\\"I am a hero who never fails; :I cannot be bothered with such details.\\" The villains almost always managed to menace Sweet Polly Purebred (voiced by Norma MacMillan), an anthropomorphic canine TV reporter, as part of their nefarious schemes; she was a helpless damsel in distress most of the time and had a habit of singing, \\"Oh, where, oh, where has my Underdog gone? Oh, where, oh, where can he be?\\" She would sing this to the music of the song \\"Oh Where Has My Little Dog Gone\\" whenever in jeopardy. Recurring villains included: * Simon Bar Sinister, voiced by Allen Swift, is a mad scientist with a voice reminiscent of Lionel Barrymore. He is the wickedest man in the world and has an assistant named Cad Lackey. A bar sinister is a diagonal line, running from top right to bottom left on medieval family coats of arms, a symbol that indicates the person is a bastard by birth; this was an inside joke typical of animation writing at the time. * Riff Raff, also voiced by Allen Swift, is an anthropomorphic wolf gangster based on noted actor George Raft. His right-hand man is Mooch, while other gang members (seen in one episode each) include Sandy the Safecracker, Spinny Wheels (who drives the gang's getaway car), Dinah Mite (the underworld's greatest bomb tosser), Nails the Carpenter, Needles the Tailor, Smitty the Blacksmith, and the Witch Doctor. Other villains included The Electric Eel (a.k.a. Slippery Eel), Battyman, Tap Tap the Chisler (an evil look-alike of Underdog who does not speak in rhyme), and Overcat. Underdog also regularly faced enemies from alien worlds, such as the Marbleheads from the planet Granite, the Magnet Men of the Magnet Planet, the aliens from the planet Zot, and the Flying Sorcerers of the Saucer Planet. The majority of the Underdog adventures were presented in the form of four-part serial episodes. Other cartoons, including Go Go Gophers and The Hunter, filled the middle segments. A 1969‚Äì1973 NBC run featured all four parts of an Underdog storyline in one half-hour show. The series was first syndicated in the U.S. in the mid-1960s under the title Cartoon Cut-Ups, which presented two Underdog segments along with Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales and The World of Commander McBragg. This package was revised in the 1970s under the Underdog Show title, now including all 124 Underdog segments and featuring Tennessee Tuxedo, Commander McBragg, Go Go Gophers, and Klondike Kat in various episodes. A syndicated package prepared for distribution outside the United States (which also aired on the Boomerang cable network) usually featured two brief Underdog episodes in a single show along with a wider variety of other Total TV cartoon shorts which appeared between such segments: Go Go Gophers, The King and Odie, Klondike Kat, Tennessee Tuxedo, The Hunter, Tooter Turtle, and Commander McBragg. On these interstitial cartoons, Tennessee Tuxedo, a penguin, was accompanied by two friends, slow-witted walrus Chumley and Professor Phineas J. Whoopie, \\"the Man With All The Answers\\". Tennessee Tuxedo was voiced by Don Adams of Get Smart (and later Inspector Gadget) fame; the knowledgeable Professor Phineas J. Whoopee was voiced by Larry Storch of F Troop fame.Underdog (1964) With the possible exception of Tennessee Tuxedo, none of these characters ever reached Underdog's level of popularity.

Like Superman, when trouble calls, he hurriedly dresses in a phone booth (which would inexplicably explode upon his conversion). On occasion, to replenish his powers, he would take an \\"Underdog Super Energy Pill\\". This pill was first introduced in episode 9. He keeps one of these pills inside a special ring he wears at all times. (Before taking one, he would often utter the words: \\"The secret compartment of my ring I fill / With an Underdog Super Energy Pill.\\") Several episodes, starting with RiffRaffville, show Underdog without his ring and being powerless, since he must take another pill as his super powers begin to fail (\\"Without my Super Energy Pill / I grow weaker and weaker and weaker still.\\") and, as a result, he can die; but of course, this being a children's cartoon show, no one actually kills him, even when he is at their mercy. He tells everyone who will listen this \\"secret\\" of his super powers. When the series was syndicated in the 1980s and 1990s, the scenes of him taking his energy pill were edited out. In the recent release Underdog: The Ultimate Collection, the word \\"Energy\\" was replaced with \\"Vitamin\\". Underdog is shown to have incredible superhuman powers. However, the number and scope of his superpowers are inconsistent from episode to episode, being subject not only to the conventions of superhero comics, but also to the conventions of humorous cartoons. In one episode, he easily moved planets, safely butting against them with his rear end. In another episode, his Super Energy Pill, diluted billions of times when added to a city's water system, was capable of giving normal humans who drank the water enough strength to easily bend thick steel bars. Among his many powers shown on the show are: super strength, super speed, supersonic flight, physical invulnerability, X-ray vision, super breath, cosmic vision, atomic breath, atomizing eyes, heat vision, ultrasonic hearing, a supersonic high- pitch hi-fi voice and a great calculating brain. Other media =Books and comics= * Underdog has also appeared in one Little Golden Book, Underdog and the Disappearing Ice Cream in 1975. * Charlton Comics produced a comic book that ran 10 issues from July 1970 to January 1972. * Gold Key Comics produced a comic book that ran 23 issues from March 1975 to February 1979. * Spotlight Comics did three issues in 1987. * Harvey Comics did a one-shot in 1993, and a five-issue series from November 1993 to July 1994. * American Mythology Comics began a new ongoing series in 2017. =Theme song= The show is also remembered for its title song, \\"Underdog,\\" which was arranged and produced by Robert Weitz, with lyrics by Chester Stover, W. Watts Biggers, Treadwell Covington, and Joseph Harris.CD liner notes: Saturday Mornings: Cartoons' Greatest Hits, 1995 MCA Records Several notable covers of the theme song have been made. The original song was sung by Robert Ragaini. He explained, \\"As a struggling singer in New York, I'd gotten a job singing a theme song for a newly proposed TV cartoon series named 'Underdog.\\" I went to the studio, I think \\"O.D.O.\\" on West 54th Street, sang as part of the backup group (ah-ooo, ah-ooo), then quickly sang the theme song over the track and left. I remember how pleased I was that I'd taken that mouthful of words and made them understandable. Oh yes, they paid me 50 dollars. No contract - I wasn't yet a member of SAG - and I was thrilled to get it. Until I heard it again, year after year.

The movie started filming in Providence, Rhode Island, in March 2006 and was released on August 3, 2007. The film was distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. Shoeshine/Underdog, voiced by Jason Lee, was played by a golden beagle named Leo sporting a red sweater and a blue cape. The film got mostly negative reviews, despite grossing $65.3 million worldwide. =Radio= In 1999, Biggers created a new episode of Underdog as a half-hour radio show narrated by veteran Boston newsman Tom Ellis with new original music composed by Biggers.

He is regarded as one of the founders of symbolic interactionism and of what has come to be referred to as the Chicago sociological tradition.  Biography  George Herbert Mead was born February 27, 1863, in South Hadley, Massachusetts. He was raised in a Protestant, middle-class family comprising his father, Hiram Mead, his mother, Elizabeth Storrs Mead (n√©e Billings), and his sister Alice. His father was a former Congregationalist pastor from a lineage of farmers and clergymen and who later held the chair in Sacred Rhetoric and Pastoral Theology at Oberlin College's theological seminary. Elizabeth taught for two years at Oberlin College and subsequently, from 1890 to 1900, serving as president of Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts. In 1879, George Mead enrolled at the Oberlin Academy at Oberlin College and then the college itself, graduating in 1883 with a Bachelor of Arts. After graduation, Mead taught grade school for about four months. For the following three years, he worked as a surveyor for the Wisconsin Central Railroad Company. In autumn 1887, Mead enrolled at Harvard University, where his main interests were philosophy and psychology. At Harvard, Mead studied with Josiah Royce, a major influence upon his thought, and William James, whose children he tutored. In 1888, Mead left Harvard after receiving only a B.A. and moved to Leipzig, Germany to study with psychologist Wilhelm Wundt, from whom he learned the concept of \\"the gesture,\\" a concept central to his later work. In 1891, Mead married Helen Kingsbury Castle (1860‚Äì1929), the sister of Henry Northrup Castle (1862‚Äì1895), a friend he met at Oberlin. Despite never finishing his dissertation, Mead was able to obtain a post at the University of Michigan in 1891. There, Mead met Charles H. Cooley and John Dewey, both of whom would influence him greatly. In 1894, Mead moved, along with Dewey, to the University of Chicago, where he taught until his death. Dewey's influence led Mead into educational theory, but his thinking soon diverged from that of Dewey, and developed into his famous psychological theories of mind, self and society. No detached philosopher, he was active in Chicago's social and political affairs; among his many activities include his work for the City Club of Chicago. Mead believed that science could be used to deal with social problems and played a key role in conducting research at the settlement house in Chicago. He also worked as treasurer for Chicago's Hull House. Mead died of heart failure on April 26, 1931.  Theory  = Pragmatism and symbolic interaction = Much of Mead's work focused on the development of the self and the objectivity of the world within the social realm: he insisted that \\"the individual mind can exist only in relation to other minds with shared meanings.\\"Mead, George Herbert. 1982. The Individual and the Social Self: Unpublished Essays by G. H. Mead, edited by D. L. Miller. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. The two most important roots of Mead's work, and of symbolic interactionism in general, are the philosophy of pragmatism and social behaviorism. Social behaviorism (as opposed to psychological behaviorism) refers to Mead's concern of the stimuli of gestures and social objects with rich meanings, rather than bare physical objects which psychological behaviourists considered stimuli. Pragmatism is a wide-ranging philosophical position from which several aspects of Mead's influences can be identified into four main tenets:McDermid, Douglas. \\"Pragmatism.\\" Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. . # True reality does not exist \\"out there\\" in the real world, it \\"is actively created as we act in and toward the world.\\" # People remember and base their knowledge of the world on what has been useful to them and are likely to alter what no longer \\"works.\\" # People define the social and physical \\"objects\\" they encounter in the world according to their use for them. # If we want to understand actors, we must base that understanding on what people actually do. Three of these ideas are critical to symbolic interactionism: *The focus on the interaction between the actor and the world *A view of both the actor and the world as dynamic processes and not static structures and *The actor's ability to interpret the social world. Thus, to Mead and symbolic interactionists, consciousness is not separated from action and interaction, but is an integral part of both. Symbolic interactionism as a pragmatic philosophy was an antecedent to the philosophy of transactionalism. Mead's theories in part, based on pragmatism and behaviorism, were transmitted to many graduate students at the University of Chicago who then went on to establish symbolic interactionism. = Social philosophy (behaviorism) = Mead was a very important figure in 20th-century social philosophy. One of his most influential ideas was the emergence of mind and self from the communication process between organisms, discussed in Mind, Self and Society (1934), also known as social behaviorism. This concept of how the mind and self emerge from the social process of communication by signs founded the symbolic interactionist school of sociology. Rooted intellectually in Hegelian dialectics and process philosophy, Mead, like John Dewey, developed a more materialist process philosophy that was based upon human action and specifically communicative action. Human activity is, in a pragmatic sense, the criterion of truth, and through human activity meaning is made. Joint activity, including communicative activity, is the means through which our sense of self is constituted. The essence of Mead's social behaviorism is that mind is not a substance located in some transcendent realm, nor is it merely a series of events that takes place within the human physiological structure. This approach opposed the traditional view of the mind as separate from the body. The emergence of mind is contingent upon interaction between the human organism and its social environment; it is through participation in the social act of communication that individuals realize their potential for significantly symbolic behavior, that is, thought. Mind, in Mead's terms, is the individualized focus of the communication process. It is linguistic behavior on the part of the individual. There is, then, no \\"mind or thought without language;\\" and language (the content of mind) \\"is only a development and product of social interaction.\\"Mead, George Herbert. 1967 [1934]. Mind, Self, and Society, edited by C. W. Morris. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. . Thus, mind is not reducible to the neurophysiology of the organic individual, but is emergent in \\"the dynamic, ongoing social process\\" that constitutes human experience. For Mead, mind arises out of the social act of communication. Mead's concept of the social act is relevant, not only to his theory of mind, but to all facets of his social philosophy. His theory of \\"mind, self, and society\\" is, in effect, a philosophy of the act from the standpoint of a social process involving the interaction of many individuals, just as his theory of knowledge and value is a philosophy of the act from the standpoint of the experiencing individual in interaction with an environment. Action is very important to his social theory and, according to Mead, actions also occur within a communicative process. The initial phase of an act constitutes a gesture. A gesture is a preparatory movement that enables other individuals to become aware of the intentions of the given organism. The rudimentary situation is a conversation of gestures, in which a gesture on the part of the first individual evokes a preparatory movement on the part of the second, and the gesture of the second organism in turn calls out a response in the first person. On this level no communication occurs. Neither organism is aware of the effect of its own gestures upon the other; the gestures are nonsignificant. For communication to take place, each organism must have knowledge of how the other individual will respond to his own ongoing act. Here the gestures are significant symbols. A significant symbol is a kind of gesture that only humans can make.This has been a contentious issue in the burgeoning field of Human Animal Studies. For a discussion see: Wilkie, Rhoda, and Andrew McKinnon. 2013. \\"George Herbert Mead on Humans and Other Animals: Social Relations after Human-Animal Studies.\\" Sociological Research Online 18(4):19. Gestures become significant symbols when they arouse in the individual who is making them the same kind of response they are supposed to elicit from those to whom the gestures are addressed. Only when we have significant symbols can we truly have communication. Mead grounded human perception in an \\"action-nexus\\".Joas, Hans. 1985. George Herbert Mead: A Contemporary Re-examination of His Thought. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. We perceive the world in terms of the \\"means of living.\\" To perceive food, is to perceive eating. To perceive a house, is to perceive shelter. That is to say, perception is in terms of action. Mead's theory of perception is similar to that of J. J. Gibson.  Social acts  Mead argued in tune with Durkheim that the individual is a product of an ongoing, pre-existing society, or more specifically, social interaction that is a consequence of a sui generis society. The self arises when the individual becomes an object to themselves. Mead argued that we are objects first to other people, and secondarily we become objects to ourselves by taking the perspective of other people. Language enables us to talk about ourselves in the same way as we talk about other people, and thus through language we become other to ourselves. In joint activity, which Mead called social acts, humans learn to see themselves from the standpoint of their co-actors. A central mechanism within the social act, which enables perspective taking, is position exchange. People within a social act often alternate social positions (e.g., giving/receiving, asking/helping, winning/losing, hiding/seeking, talking/listening). In children's games there is repeated position exchange, for example in hide-and-seek, and Mead argued that this is one of the main ways that perspective taking develops. However, for Mead, unlike Dewey and J. J. Gibson, the key is not simply human action, but rather social action. In humans the \\"manipulatory phase of the act\\" is socially mediated, that is to say, in acting towards objects humans simultaneously take the perspectives of others towards that object. This is what Mead means by \\"the social act\\" as opposed to simply \\"the act\\" (the latter being a Deweyan concept). Non-human animals also manipulate objects, but that is a non-social manipulation, they do not take the perspective of other organisms toward the object. Humans on the other hand, take the perspective of other actors towards objects, and this is what enables complex human society and subtle social coordination. In the social act of economic exchange, for example, both buyer and seller must take each other's perspectives towards the object being exchanged. The seller must recognize the value for the buyer, while the buyer must recognize the desirability of money for the seller. Only with this mutual perspective taking can the economic exchange occur. (Mead was influenced on this point by Adam Smith.) =Nature of the self= A final piece of Mead's social theory is the mind as the individual importation of the social process. Mead states that \\"the self is a social process,\\" meaning that there are series of actions that go on in the mind to help formulate one's complete self. As previously discussed, Mead presented the self and the mind in terms of a social process. As gestures are taken in by the individual organism, the individual organism also takes in the collective attitudes of others, in the form of gestures, and reacts accordingly with other organized attitudes. This process is characterized by Mead as the I and the Me. The 'Me' is the social self and the 'I' is the response to the 'Me'. In other words, the 'I' is the response of an individual to the attitudes of others, while the 'Me' is the organized set of attitudes of others which an individual assumes. Mead develops William James' distinction between the 'I' and the 'Me'. The 'Me' is the accumulated understanding of \\"the generalized other\\" i.e. how one thinks one's group perceives oneself etc. The 'I' is the individual's impulses. The 'I' is self as subject; the 'Me' is self as object. The 'I' is the knower, the 'Me' is the known. The mind, or stream of thought, is the self-reflective movements of the interaction between the \\"I\\" and the 'Me'. There is neither \\"I\\" nor 'Me' in the conversation of gestures; the whole act is not yet carried out, but the preparation takes place in this field of gesture. These dynamics go beyond selfhood in a narrow sense, and form the basis of a theory of human cognition. For Mead the thinking process is the internalized dialogue between the 'I' and the 'Me'. Mead rooted the self's \\"perception and meaning\\" deeply and sociologically in \\"a common praxis of subjects,\\" found specifically in social encounters. Understood as a combination of the 'I' and the 'Me', Mead's self proves to be noticeably entwined within a sociological existence. For Mead, existence in community comes before individual consciousness. First one must participate in the different social positions within society and only subsequently can one use that experience to take the perspective of others and thus become 'conscious'. =Philosophy of science= Mead was a major American philosopher by virtue of being, along with John Dewey, Charles Peirce and William James, one of the founders of pragmatism. He also made significant contributions to the philosophies of nature, science, and history, to philosophical anthropology, and to process philosophy. Dewey and Alfred North Whitehead considered Mead a thinker of the first rank. He is a classic example of a social theorist whose work does not fit easily within conventional disciplinary boundaries. As far as his work on the philosophy of science, Mead sought to find the psychological origin of science in the efforts of individuals to attain power over their environment. The notion of a physical object arises out of manipulatory experience. There is a social relation to inanimate objects, for the organism takes the role of things that it manipulates directly, or that it manipulates indirectly in perception. For example, in taking (introjecting or imitating) the resistant role of a solid object, an individual obtains cognition of what is \\"inside\\" nonliving things. Historically, the concept of the physical object arose from an animistic conception of the universe. Contact experience includes experiences of position, balance, and support, and these are used by the organism when it creates its conceptions of the physical world. Our scientific concepts of space, time, and mass are abstracted from manipulatory experience. Such concepts as that of the electron are also derived from manipulation. In developing a science we construct hypothetical objects in order to assist ourselves in controlling nature. The conception of the present as a distinct unit of experience, rather than as a process of becoming and disappearing, is a scientific fiction devised to facilitate exact measurement. In the scientific worldview immediate experience is replaced by theoretical constructs. The ultimate in experience, however, is the manipulation and contact at the completion of an act. = Play and game and the generalized other = Mead theorized that human beings begin their understanding of the social world through \\"play\\" and \\"game\\". Play comes first in the child's development. The child takes different roles he/she observes in \\"adult\\" society, and plays them out to gain an understanding of the different social roles. For instance, he first plays the role of policeman and then the role of thief while playing \\"Cops and Robbers,\\" and plays the role of doctor and patient when playing \\"Doctor.\\" As a result of such play, the child learns to become both subject and object and begins to become able to build a self. However, it is a limited self because the child can only take the role of distinct and separate others, they still lack a more general and organized sense of themselves. In the next stage, the game stage, it is required that a person develop a full sense of self. Whereas in the play stage the child takes on the role of distinct others, in the game stage the child must take the role of everyone else involved in the game. Furthermore, these roles must have a definite relationship to one another. To illustrate the game stage, Mead gives his famous example of a baseball game: > But in a game where a number of individuals are involved, then the child > taking one role must be ready to take the role of everyone else. If he gets > in a ball nine he must have the responses of each position involved in his > own position. He must know what everyone else is going to do in order to > carry out his own play. He has to take all of these roles. They do not all > have to be present in consciousness at the same time, but at some moments he > has to have three or four individuals present in his own attitude, such as > the one who is going to throw the ball, the one who is going to catch it and > so on. These responses must be, in some degree, present in his own make-up. > In the game, then, there is a set of responses of such others so organized > that the attitude of one calls out the appropriate attitudes of the other. In the game stage, organization begins and definite personalities start to emerge. Children begin to become able to function in organized groups and most importantly, to determine what they will do within a specific group. Mead calls this the child's first encounter with \\"the generalized other,\\" which is one of the main concepts Mead proposes for understanding the emergence of the (social) self in human beings. \\"The generalized other\\" can be thought of as understanding the given activity and the actors' place within the activity from the perspective of all the others engaged in the activity. Through understanding \\"the generalized other\\" the individual understands what kind of behavior is expected, appropriate and so on, in different social settings. Some may find that social acts (e.g. games and routine forms of social interaction) enable perspective taking through 'position exchange'. Assuming that games and routine social acts have differentiated social positions, and that these positions create our cognitive perspectives, then it might be that by moving between roles in a game (e.g. between hiding and seeking or buying and selling) we come to learn about the perspective of the other. This new interpretation of Mead's account of taking the perspective of the other has experimental support.  Writings  In a career spanning more than 40 years, Mead wrote almost constantly and published numerous articles and book reviews in both philosophy and psychology. However, he did not publish any books. Following his death, several of his students put together and edited four volumes from records of Mead's social psychology course at the University of Chicago, his lecture notes (Mead's Carus Lectures, 1930, edited by Charles W. Morris), and his numerous unpublished papers. In his lifetime, Mead published around 100 scholarly articles, reviews, and incidental pieces. Given their diverse nature, access to these writings is difficult. The first editorial efforts to change this situation date from the 1960s. In 1964, Andrew J. Reck collected twenty-five of Mead's published articles in Selected Writings: George Herbert Mead. Four years later, John W. Petras published George Herbert Mead: Essays on his Social Psychology, a collection of fifteen articles that included previously unpublished manuscripts. More recently, Mary Jo Deegan (2001) published Essays in Social Psychology, a book project originally abandoned by Mead in the early 1910s.Mead, George Herbert. 2001 [c. 1910s].

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 16, 2003. In this episode, Bart discovers that he used to be a child star in commercials‚Äîand that Homer spent all the money he earned. In retaliation, Bart petitions the court to be legally emancipated, and he moves out of the house. Plot While Bart and Lisa are cleaning out the garage, they stumble across old home movies. One of the tapes they found has an old episode of the sitcom Perfect Strangers on it, followed by a commercial for a product called \\"Baby Stink-Breath\\"‚Äî with Bart as a baby with bad breath. Bart confronts Homer and Marge about the advertisement, and is told that his part in the commercial made him a lot of money. Although Marge attempts to comfort him by stating she had it put away in a trust fund, Homer rudely interrupts and confesses that he spent it all to buy back incriminating photos to avoid a scandal. The next day, a furious Bart goes to a law firm named \\"Luvum and Burnham\\" Family Law, at Milhouse's suggestion. He meets the Blue Haired Lawyer there, and tells him that he wants a 'divorce' from his family. The next day, during dinner, the Blue Haired Lawyer comes to the house to serve Homer with a subpoena and a side of bacon to open the door. When the family discovers that Bart is suing them and declaring that he wants to be emancipated, they are horrified. An angry Homer defends himself by telling Bart that his father was terrible to him and rather than sue Abe, Homer got his revenge by dropping him off at a cheap nursing home. At the trial, Bart's case is made clear in various ways, such as using a doll and Homer's anger management issues. Homer tries to deny it, claiming he is a calm and collected father who has minor anger problems when his son does something to make him mad. Judge Harm does not believe him and asks the stenographer to repeat the very same threatening words he spoke, much to both his embarrassment and Bart's lawyer's joy. She begins to mention that Bart is too young for emancipation, Homer is rude in interrupting her. He is happy and believes he's won the case. When Homer attempts to exert his control in his plans to punish Bart, Judge Harm is angered and rudely interrupts him. She mentions that she will make an exception for Bart's case. This makes Homer even more nervous than before knowing the capabilities of her ruling. Judge Harm cites that his sociopathic behavior and extreme anger management issues towards Bart are sufficient reasons that is unsafe for him to continue living at home. She declares him legally emancipated and is allowed to live on his own. As a result, Judge Harm orders Homer to give up half his salary as his punishment for stealing Bart's money. He tries to plead his case to her against giving up his paycheck, claiming he's already paying for alimony to his Vegas ex-wife and thinks the punishment is unfair. When Harm ignores him, Marge tries to get him to be reasonable and behave himself. Furious, Homer tries to attack Judge Harm, but the bailiff stops him and drags him away for contempt of court. The next day, Bart rents a loft near downtown and says tearful goodbyes to everyone except Homer. Marge tries to convince him to stay, promising that she will let him swear in the house more. Bart refuses and tells Marge that she, Lisa, and Maggie have done nothing wrong. His problem has always been with Homer and now that Bart is emancipated, he is free from his father's abuse. Bart leaves in a taxi and Homer breaks down sobbing in the middle of the road. Despite an early and scary experience in the loft to its dangerous location, Bart discovers that Tony Hawk is also living in the building and throwing a party with punk band Blink-182. He and Hawk become friends, and he is content with his new life. Back at the Simpson house, Marge is still depressed about Bart being gone and convinces Homer to apologize to him. The family goes to meet him at his loft and Homer apologizes. Despite accepting the apology and promise of better treatment, Bart tells them that he is going on Tony Hawk's Skewed Tour. At the event, Homer meets up with Hawk and pleads with him to pretend to lose to him so that he can make Bart proud of him again. Hawk reluctantly agrees and gives Homer a modified skateboard, which does all the stunt work. Later on, Hawk decides to teach Homer a lesson in humility for the way he has hurt Bart. After a skateboard match, Tony falls to the ground and Homer finally promises that he will never mistreat Bart again. Lindsey Naegle approaches Homer and asks him to star in a commercial. Homer accepts so that he can get Bart fully repaid. At the Simpson house, Homer is embarrassed when he watches the final product, an advertisement for an impotence drug, but Bart tells him that nobody will remember it in 50 years. Fifty years later, Homer is dead, and an elderly Nelson Muntz visits his grave to laugh at him. Cultural references Homer and Tony Hawk's aerial skateboard duel resembles the kung fu air combat in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Homer's holding an infant Bart off a balcony awning is a reference to Michael Jackson. The episode title is a reference to the movie Starting Over (1979), as well as the John Lennon song \\"(Just Like) Starting Over\\". Production According to the Complete Fourteenth Season commentary, the FOX network insisted that the 300th episode be scheduled specifically on February 16, 2003 so that there was time to plan a huge promotion for the episode. However, the actual 300th episode would have already aired two weeks prior. This was referenced in this episode during a joke where Lisa tallies the number of Homer's schemes at 300; Marge comments \\"I could've sworn it was 302.\\" Blink-182 recorded their lines for the episode on April 24, 2002; Hawk recorded his a week later on April 29. Mark Hoppus of Blink-182 has stated that being on The Simpsons was \\"truly one of those ‚Äúwow, this is unreal‚Äù moments that I‚Äôve been lucky enough to experience. It still makes my day every time I think about it.\\" Tony Hawk also said, \\"Being on The Simpsons, let alone a milestone episode, really made me think to myself that I've actually, completely made it.\\" Reception In 2007, Simon Crerar of The Times listed Tony Hawk's performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos in the history of the show.

It is a part of universal algebra, in the sense that it relates to all types of algebraic structure (with finitary operations). It also has a formulation in terms of category theory, although this is in yet more abstract terms. Examples include free groups, tensor algebras, or free lattices. Informally, a free object over a set A can be thought of as being a \\"generic\\" algebraic structure over A: the only equations that hold between elements of the free object are those that follow from the defining axioms of the algebraic structure. Definition Free objects are the direct generalization to categories of the notion of basis in a vector space. A linear function between vector spaces is entirely determined by its values on a basis of the vector space E1. The following definition translates this to any category. A concrete category is a category that is equipped with a faithful functor to Set, the category of sets. Let C be a concrete category with faithful functor . Let X be an object in Set (that is, X is a set, here called a basis), let A be an object in C, and let be an injective map between the sets X and F(A) (called the canonical insertion). Then A is said to be the free object on X (with respect to i) if and only if it satisfies the following universal property: :for any object B in C and any map between sets , there exists a unique morphism in C such that . That is, the following diagram commutes: :: \\\\begin{array}{c} X \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\quad i \\\\quad} F(A) \\\\\\\\\\\\ {}_f \\\\searrow \\\\quad \\\\swarrow {}_{F(g)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ F(B) \\\\quad \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} In this way the free functor that builds the free object A from the set X becomes left adjoint to the forgetful functor. Examples The creation of free objects proceeds in two steps. For algebras that conform to the associative law, the first step is to consider the collection of all possible words formed from an alphabet. Then one imposes a set of equivalence relations upon the words, where the relations are the defining relations of the algebraic object at hand. The free object then consists of the set of equivalence classes. Consider, for example, the construction of the free group in two generators. One starts with an alphabet consisting of the five letters \\\\\\\\{e,a,b,a^{-1},b^{-1}\\\\\\\\}. In the first step, there is not yet any assigned meaning to the \\"letters\\" a^{-1} or b^{-1}; these will be given later, in the second step. Thus, one could equally well start with the alphabet in five letters that is S=\\\\\\\\{a,b,c,d,e\\\\\\\\}. In this example, the set of all words or strings W(S) will include strings such as aebecede and abdc, and so on, of arbitrary finite length, with the letters arranged in every possible order. In the next step, one imposes a set of equivalence relations. The equivalence relations for a group are that of multiplication by the identity, ge=eg=g, and the multiplication of inverses: gg^{-1}=g^{-1}g=e. Applying these relations to the strings above, one obtains :aebecede = aba^{-1}b^{-1}, where it was understood that c is a stand-in for a^{-1}, and d is a stand-in for b^{-1}, while e is the identity element. Similarly, one has :abdc = abb^{-1}a^{-1} = e. Denoting the equivalence relation or congruence by \\\\sim, the free object is then the collection of equivalence classes of words. Thus, in this example, the free group in two generators is the quotient :F_2=W(S)/\\\\sim. This is often written as F_2=W(S)/E where W(S) = \\\\\\\\{a_1 a_2 \\\\ldots a_n \\\\, \\\\vert \\\\; a_k \\\\in S \\\\, ; \\\\, n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}\\\\\\\\} is the set of all words, and E = \\\\\\\\{a_1 a_2 \\\\ldots a_n \\\\, \\\\vert \\\\; e = a_1 a_2 \\\\ldots a_n \\\\, ; \\\\, a_k \\\\in S \\\\, ; \\\\, n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}\\\\\\\\} is the equivalence class of the identity, after the relations defining a group are imposed. A simpler example are the free monoids. The free monoid on a set X, is the monoid of all finite strings using X as alphabet, with operation concatenation of strings. The identity is the empty string. In essence, the free monoid is simply the set of all words, with no equivalence relations imposed. This example is developed further in the article on the Kleene star. =General case= In the general case, the algebraic relations need not be associative, in which case the starting point is not the set of all words, but rather, strings punctuated with parentheses, which are used to indicate the non-associative groupings of letters. Such a string may equivalently be represented by a binary tree or a free magma; the leaves of the tree are the letters from the alphabet. The algebraic relations may then be general arities or finitary relations on the leaves of the tree. Rather than starting with the collection of all possible parenthesized strings, it can be more convenient to start with the Herbrand universe. Properly describing or enumerating the contents of a free object can be easy or difficult, depending on the particular algebraic object in question. For example, the free group in two generators is easily described. By contrast, little or nothing is known about the structure of free Heyting algebras in more than one generator.Peter T. Johnstone, Stone Spaces, (1982) Cambridge University Press, . (A treatment of the one-generator free Heyting algebra is given in chapter 1, section 4.11) The problem of determining if two different strings belong to the same equivalence class is known as the word problem. As the examples suggest, free objects look like constructions from syntax; one may reverse that to some extent by saying that major uses of syntax can be explained and characterised as free objects, in a way that makes apparently heavy 'punctuation' explicable (and more memorable). Free universal algebras Let S be any set, and let \\\\mathbf{A} be an algebraic structure of type \\\\rho generated by S. Let the underlying set of this algebraic structure \\\\mathbf{A}, sometimes called its universe, be A, and let \\\\psi: S \\\\to A be a function. We say that (A, \\\\psi) (or informally just \\\\mathbf{A}) is a free algebra (of type \\\\rho) on the set S of free generators if, for every algebra \\\\mathbf{B} of type \\\\rho and every function \\\\tau: S \\\\to B, where B is a universe of \\\\mathbf{B}, there exists a unique homomorphism \\\\sigma: A \\\\to B such that \\\\sigma \\\\circ \\\\psi = \\\\tau. Free functor The most general setting for a free object is in category theory, where one defines a functor, the free functor, that is the left adjoint to the forgetful functor. Consider the category C of algebraic structures; these can be thought of as sets plus operations, obeying some laws. This category has a functor, U:\\\\mathbf{C}\\\\to\\\\mathbf{Set}, the forgetful functor, which maps objects and functions in C to Set, the category of sets. The forgetful functor is very simple: it just ignores all of the operations. The free functor F, when it exists, is the left adjoint to U. That is, F:\\\\mathbf{Set}\\\\to\\\\mathbf{C} takes sets X in Set to their corresponding free objects F(X) in the category C. The set X can be thought of as the set of \\"generators\\" of the free object F(X). For the free functor to be a left adjoint, one must also have a Set-morphism \\\\eta:X\\\\to U(F(X))\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. More explicitly, F is, up to isomorphisms in C, characterized by the following universal property: :Whenever A is an algebra in C, and is a function (a morphism in the category of sets), then there is a unique C-morphism such that . Concretely, this sends a set into the free object on that set; it is the \\"inclusion of a basis\\". Abusing notation, X \\\\to F(X) (this abuses notation because X is a set, while F(X) is an algebra; correctly, it is X \\\\to U(F(X))). The natural transformation \\\\eta:\\\\operatorname{id}_\\\\mathbf{Set}\\\\to UF is called the unit; together with the counit \\\\varepsilon:FU\\\\to \\\\operatorname {id}_\\\\mathbf{C}, one may construct a T-algebra, and so a monad. The cofree functor is the right adjoint to the forgetful functor. =Existence= There are general existence theorems that apply; the most basic of them guarantees that :Whenever C is a variety, then for every set X there is a free object F(X) in C. Here, a variety is a synonym for a finitary algebraic category, thus implying that the set of relations are finitary, and algebraic because it is monadic over Set. =General case= Other types of forgetfulness also give rise to objects quite like free objects, in that they are left adjoint to a forgetful functor, not necessarily to sets. For example, the tensor algebra construction on a vector space is the left adjoint to the functor on associative algebras that ignores the algebra structure. It is therefore often also called a free algebra. Likewise the symmetric algebra and exterior algebra are free symmetric and anti-symmetric algebras on a vector space.

He is also the first person to create animation solely using cardboard cutouts. Biography Quirino Cristiani was born on July 2, 1896 in Santa Giuletta, Italy. His family moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1900, and Quirino spent his childhood soaking up the fast pace and left-leaning politics of the great southern metropolis. He came to consider himself a porte√±o first (as the natives of the port of Buenos Aires called themselves) and an Argentine second. As a teenager, he developed a passion for drawing, which led him through a brief course with the Academy of Fine Arts to the publication of political caricatures for the city newspapers. Soon the perfect target for his satire presented himself. The national elections of 1916 peacefully ended the 36-year-long rule of the Conservative party and placed Radical party leader Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen in the president's seat. Yrigoyen favored the lower middle class, especially in Buenos Aires, and granted unprecedented freedom to the press. The press in response turned on him, mocking his social awkwardness, his replacement of Conservative corruption with Radical corruption in the government, and his decision to keep Argentina out of World War I, a decision that was unpopular with the germanophile Argentine military. He soon was dubbed \\"Peludo\\" (\\"shaggy\\") for his lack of personal grooming (with the additional slang meaning of \\"idiot\\"). Living in the capital was another Italian immigrant, Federico Valle, once a cameraman and director in Europe (he used Wilbur Wright's visit to Rome in 1909 as the opportunity to film the world's first aerial cinematography), now a producer of newsreels for his adopted country. Valle was apolitical, but he knew the porte√±os were not. He hired the twenty-year-old Cristiani off the street, gave him √âmile Cohl's Les Allumettes anim√©es (Animated Matches, 1908) to teach him the technique, and set him loose. Before 1916 was out, Valle's newsreel Actualides Valle came out with an episode including the one-minute cartoon La Intervenci√≥n en la provincia de Buenos Aires (Intervention in the Province of Buenos Aires) by Quirino Cristiani. The cartoon was about Yrigoyen's ouster of Buenos Aires governor Marcelino Ugarte for dishonesty. This film used cardboard cutouts as the form of animation, a choice Cristiani would stick with throughout his career. Yrigoyen); Cristiani patented these figures in 1916 for the realization of his films. This short film did surprisingly well, and Valle announced a new project: the green animator would next create the world's first feature-length animated film, with President Yrigoyen as the subject. The funding would come from a Mr. Franchini, who owned a chain of movie theatres to show the finished film. Cristiani would get his character designs from newspaper cartoonist Di√≥genes Taborda (pen name \\"El Mono\\", \\"The Monkey\\") Cristiani managed to accomplish his goal, doing the lion's share of the animation, the 58,000-frame El Ap√≥stol (an hour and ten minutes at 14 frames per second) premiered on November 9, 1917 and destroyed in 1926. The movie was a satire, with President Yrigoyen ascending to the heavens to use Jupiter's thunderbolts to cleanse Buenos Aires of immorality and corruption. The result is a burnt city. The film was well-received, but most of the praise went to producer Valle, with what was left over going to Taborda. In 1918, the German commander in Argentina, Baron von Luxburg, decided to manipulate Argentina into joining World War I on its side by sinking an Argentine ship and blaming the act on the Entente. The tales of the survivors of the incident led nearly everyone to realize what really happened, but Yrigoyen swung his political weight to cover the incident up, out of fear that Argentina might be pushed into the war as an enemy of Germany, an outcome he feared just as much as a German alliance. Cristiani saw the incident as the perfect opportunity, and with a new set of producers created the world's second feature-length animated film, Sin dejar rastros in 1918. The title (Leaving No Trace) was a reference to von Luxburg's supposed order to the German U-boat captain who sank the ship. President Yrigoyen felt he had no choice but to order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to confiscate the film the day after it premiered. In doing this, the Radical showed himself little better than the repressive Conservative presidents he had replaced. On the other hand, Cristiani was not imprisoned and spent the next several years creating political cartoons and caricatures for the newspapers. Two other animated features were put out at this time by Andr√©s Ducaud, the man who designed the fire effects in El Ap√≥stol. To support his growing family, Cristiani founded the advertising company Publi-Cinema, where he made short commercial cartoons. To show these cartoons, he traveled to the poorer parts of town, where no movie theatres were to be found, and showed the paying public Chaplin shorts and other films interspersed with his animation. This did so well that the police shut him down for \\"disturbing the peace and interrupting traffic\\". President \\"Peludo\\" finished out his six-year term in 1922, and was succeeded by another Radical, Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear. During Alvear's presidency, Cristiani started making animated shorts for entertainment purposes. Some of the titles included Firpo-Dempsey (1923) on the boxing match between American heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey and Argentinian champion Luis Firpo, Uruguayos Forever (1924) on Uruguay's Olympic gold medal in soccer, and Humberto de garufa (Little Umberto's Folic, 1924), on the visit of Italian Prince Umberto of Savoy to Buenos Aires. In 1918 and 1926, a fire destroyed Federico Valle's film vaults; among the films lost forever was El Ap√≥stol. In 1928, the aging Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen was re-elected president of Argentina. Cristiani felt that the man was too dominated by the corrupt leaders of the Radical party. With a script by Eduardo Gonzalez Lanuza, he set out to make his third animated feature film, Pelud√≥polis. The movie was to be a sort of fable, with pirate Yrigoyen's floating \\"Peludo City\\" (Argentina) beset by hungry sharks (the Radicals). Cristiani converted the operation over to sound partway through, including a few songs in the soundtrack (he used the primitive sound-on-disc system for the recording since it was unlikely that most Argentine theaters would be able to handle sound-on-film at the time of release). Then, on September 6, 1930, a year into production, work on Pelud√≥polis was halted when President Yrigoyen was ousted by a Conservative military coup d'√©tat. With so much invested in the film so far, Cristiani decided to proceed, re-arranging the plot to de- emphasize Yrigoyen and the sharks, and carefully adding the characters of the generals as the heroes, in an attempt to protect himself from possible persecution. He then added an everyman character named Juan Pueblo, to become the moral centre of the film. With the provisional blessing of the provisional ruler of Argentina, General Jos√© F√©lix Uriburu, Cristiani premiered the film on September 16, 1931. Few people felt that the wake of a revolution was the right time to laugh about it. In addition, the Great Depression had come to Argentina. Yrigoyen died in bed in 1933 and suddenly the entire country was gripped with grief for a man few had cared deeply for when he was alive. Cristiani respectfully withdrew the film from circulation. Quirino Cristiani never had another chance for greatness in animation. Mickey Mouse took over Argentina like he had the rest of the world, and like so many other artists, Cristiani couldn't compete. Studios Cristiani was converted into a dubbing/subbing lab, one of the best of its kind in Argentina. Cristiani made three more animated films in his life, none of which were memorable. When Walt Disney came to Argentina as part of his Latin America research tour, Cristiani showed his films to him, then sent him to cartoonist Molina Campos, the source of the gaucho segment in Saludos Amigos (1943). Cristiani has been called \\"The man who anticipated Disney.\\" Two fires in 1957 and 1961 destroyed the majority of Cristiani's work, including the only prints of Pelud√≥polis. He died in Bernal, Argentina on August 2, 1984.

Like the church it emerged from, it has roots both in Anabaptism and in Radical Pietism. It practices adult believers baptism as the biblically valid form of baptism. It is one of several Schwarzenau Brethren groups that trace their roots to 1708, when eight believers founded a new church in Schwarzenau, Germany. The Old German Baptist Brethren church has about 14,000 baptized members. Names The Old German Baptist Brethren are historically known as German Baptists in contrast to English Baptists, who have different roots. Other names by which they are sometimes identified are Dunkers, Dunkards, Tunkers, and T√§ufer, all relating to their practice of baptism by immersion. Originally known as Neu-T√§ufer (new Baptists), in America they used the name \\"German Baptist\\" and officially adopted the title \\"German Baptist Brethren\\" at their Annual Meeting in 1871. From their formation in 1881 and until the early 1900s the Old German Baptist Brethren were often referred to as \\"Old Order German Baptist Brethren\\". There are several different Brethren groups that are not related to the Schwarzenau movement, such as the Plymouth Brethren that arose in England and Ireland early in the 19th century through the labors of Edward Cronin and John Nelson Darby. However, the teachings of Darby, called Dispensationalism, have been influential among many in the Old German Baptist Brethren. History =Beginnings= The Schwarzenau Brethren were first organized in 1708 under the leadership of Alexander Mack (1679‚Äì1735) in Schwarzenau, Germany, now part of Bad Berleburg in North Rhine-Westphalia. In August of the same year five men and three women gathered at the Eder, a small river that flows through Schwarzenau, to perform baptism as an outward symbol of their new faith. One of the members of the group first baptized Mack, who then, in turn, baptized the other seven. Mack along with the seven others believed that both the Lutheran and Reformed churches were taking liberties with the true message of Christianity revealed in the New Testament, so they rejected state-church unions, established liturgy, including infant baptism and existing Eucharistic practices. The founding Brethren were broadly influenced by Radical Pietist understandings of an invisible, nondenominational church of awakened Christians who would fellowship together in purity and love, following Jesus while awaiting Christ's return. A notable influence was Ernest Christopher Hochmann von Hochenau, a traveling Pietist minister. While living in Schriesheim, his home town, Mack invited Hochmann to come and minister there. Like others who influenced the Brethren, Hochmann considered the pure church to be spiritual, and did not believe that a highly organized church was necessary. By 1708, the date of the first Brethren baptisms, Mack had rejected this position in favor of forming a separate church with visible rules and ordinances‚Äîincluding threefold baptism by immersion, a three part Love Feast (that combined communion with feetwashing and an evening meal), anointing, and use of the \\"ban\\" against wayward members. Religious persecution drove the Brethren to take refuge in Friesland, in the Netherlands. In 1719 Peter Becker brought a group to Pennsylvania. In 1720 forty Brethren families settled in Surhuisterveen in Friesland. They settled among the Mennonites and Collegiants there, remaining until 1729, when all but a handful emigrated to America in three separate groups from 1719 to 1733. By 1740, nearly all of the \\"Schwarzenau\\" Brethren had relocated to Pennsylvania and they ceased to exist as an organized group in Europe. Peter Becker organized the first American congregation at Germantown, Pennsylvania, on December 25, 1723. In 1743 Christopher Sauer, an early preacher and a printer by trade, printed a Bible in German, the first published in a European language in North America. =Early schisms= The first schism from the general body of German Baptist Brethren occurred in 1728, but more followed after the American Revolution, as different groups sought their own ways. The first separatists became the Seventh Day Dunker Brethren, whose distinctive principle was that they believed that Saturday was still the true Sabbath. They were founded by Conrad Beissel (1690‚Äì1768). In 1732 Beissel led the establishment of a semi-monastic community with a convent and monastery at Ephrata, in what is now Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. While celibate, the community also welcomed believing families, who lived nearby and participated in joint worship. The monastic feature and celibacy were gradually abandoned after the American Revolution. In 1814 the Society was incorporated as the Seventh Day German Baptist Church. Several branches were established, some of which still exist.German Seventh- Day Baptists A group called the Church of God or \\"New Dunkers\\" withdrew in 1848. They disbanded in August 1962. In 1782 the Brethren forbade slaveholding by its members. The German Baptist Brethren grew from a small sect of about 1,500 German speaking members in 1790 to a mainly English speaking church with about 58,000 members in 500 congregation in 1880.Donald B. Kraybill and Carl D. Bowman: On the Backroad to Heaven: Old Order Hutterites, Mennonites, Amish, and Brethren, (2001) Johns Hopkins University Press, page 138. =The divisions of the early 1880s= In the early 1880s there was a three-way division among the German Baptist Brethren: In 1881, the Old German Baptist Brethren broke away from the main body in order to maintain older customs, dress, and forms of worship. In 1883, the Brethren Church left the German Baptist Brethren over several matters revolving around separation from following fleeting fashions and whatever is popular with the world (James 4:4) including Sunday Schools, higher education, expensive and luxurious dress fads, revivalism, nationalism and practicing less church discipline. The Old German Baptist Brethren and Old Brethren churches represent the conservative faction that wanted to remain plain and live a more simple, family and church- focused lifestyle with personal discipleship, daily and weekly worship, bearing one another's burdens, working together to build relationships while conquering obstacles. They did not want to lose their children to a fast, self-centered lifestyle and were cautiously observing rather than automatically accepting every new innovation of the 19th century. The Brethren Church representa the progressive faction, pushing ahead because of their belief that a newer way of doing things is a better way. The German Baptist Brethren changed their name to the Church of the Brethren in 1908.Donald B. Kraybill and Carl D. Bowman: On the Backroad to Heaven: Old Order Hutterites, Mennonites, Amish, and Brethren, (2001) Johns Hopkins University Press, page 138. The most conservative Brethren churches emphasize consistency, commitment to daily discipleship and literally following the New Testament, which is the order of the Brethren. They favor a capella singing, as the voice is the instrument God made. They do not trust the fruit of spiritual innovations, such as Sunday Schools and emotional extended meetings. They promote plain dress, simple uncomplicated living, reading and following the words of Jesus. They believe that worldly amusements and entertainment appeal to and feed the flesh rather than the spirit, often taking the place of regular worship and fellowship becoming forms of idolatry. They believe Jesus is calling all of us to be disciples, to love and follow Him. The progressives in the Brethren church focused on grace, novel practices, assimilation and acceptance. They promote higher education, salaried ministers, liturgical services and Sunday Schools, and revivalism. The majority of Brethren hold a position between the two extremes. In 1869 and 1880, a group of Brethren in the Miami River Valley of Ohio submitted a petition to Annual Conference to stop the liberalization and return to traditional Biblical Brethren values. On both occasions, a more moderate petition was submitted to the delegates. Both times, the Miami River Valley group found the rewording unclear, and therefore unacceptable. In 1881, they resubmitted their petition to Annual Conference, and it was rejected for violating a technical procedure. In November 1881, conservative Brethren led by the Miami River Valley group met and formally split from the Church of the Brethren to form the Old German Baptist Brethren. They held their first annual meeting in 1882. At the same time, Henry Holsinger, a leader of the progressives in the church, published writings that some Brethren considered slanderous, anti-Jesus, and unscriptural and schismatic. As a result, he was dis-fellowshipped from the 1882 annual meeting of the Brethren. He met with other progressives on June 6 and 7, 1883, and together they formed The Brethren Church.Brethren Church homepage The remaining middle group‚Äîcalled \\"conservatives\\"‚Äîretained the name German Baptist Brethren. At the Annual Conference of 1908 at Des Moines, Iowa, the name was officially changed to the Church of the Brethren. The Annual Conference justified the name change by citing the predominant use of English in the church, the fact that the name \\"German Baptist\\" frustrated mission work, and that it would disassociate the denomination from the Old German Baptist Brethren. =Departure of small conservative groups= In the early 20th century several more conservative Brethren left the Old German Baptist Brethren and formed their own churches. In 1913, a group broke away in Indiana and formed the Old Brethren. In 1915, another congregation of Old Brethren was organized in California. The issue which is often given as the initial cause for division was the changes brought in with acceptance of automobiles and telephones among the Old German Baptist Brethren. Generally, the Old Brethren also wanted more unity and wanted to uphold the old order form of annual meeting which was simpler than had recently developed among the Old German Baptists. There was more division over the acceptance of the automobile in 1930. After the 1930 divide, those who adopted the use of the automobile placed less stress on annual meeting authority than did the parent body, believing it to be more for edification and teaching. Personal conviction from the Holy Spirit and Scripture rather than legislative decisions of annual meeting is now the basis for adherence to the church's order. Old Brethren adult membership, among six congregations (in California, Arkansas, Indiana, and Ohio), in 2000 was 250. In 1939, Old Brethren who wished to maintain the stress on annual meeting decisions and the rejection of automobiles, telephones, electricity, and tractors formed a group called the Old Brethren German Baptists. Old Brethren German Baptist membership in 2012 was over 100 and growing rapidly, with congregations in Indiana, Ohio and Missouri. As the original Old German Baptist Brethren body became more accepting of automobiles, another group withdrew in 1921 to become the Old Order German Baptist Brethren. They do not use automobiles, electric power or telephones but do use tractors in the field and for transportation on the public roadways for work related activities, such as going to work sites or selling produce in towns. Two other minor divisions in the parent body of \\"Old German Baptist Brethren\\" occurred in the 1990s resulting in three car driving congregations of 185 total members. While each conference has an \\"official\\" name, members of all conferences refer to themselves generally as Old Order German Baptists. =Further Division= In 2009, a major division was a result of the rejection, by a large percentage of members (approximately 2,400 individuals),Cold Waters to a Thirsty Soul, Sept. 2009 of an unprecedented committee report Minutes of the Annual Meeting of The Old German Baptist Brethren Church May 30-June 2, 2009. Published by \\"The Vindicator\\" adopted by the 2009 Annual Meeting held near Waterford, CA. The report stated in part, \\"Members of the Old German Baptist Brethren Church in full fellowship and in good standing with the Church, believe and agree that the Old German Baptist Brethren‚Äôs interpretation of NT doctrine is scriptural and has been prompted by the Holy Spirit and it is their mind to remain in this fellowship and to teach, support and promote the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. It will be expected that members hearing the reading of this report will be willing to accept the same.\\" No positions on specific questions of doctrine or church practice before the Conference were addressed in the Report, though the general understanding was that it asked for an affirmation of loyalty to traditional doctrine and practice as understood by the more traditional/conservative arm of membership. Conference representatives were sent to each district (congregation) in the brotherhood to determine the willingness of each member to accept the report. Those who refused to accept the report gave their names, which were recorded and sent to the secretary of the standing committee for processing, and they were disfellowshipped (ie excommunicated). Members who refused to accept the Report were given 60 days to reconsider their decision without repercussion. Those who remained silent or did not attend the meetings were assumed to be in agreement or willing to submit to the decision, and were retained as members. A majority of the members who did not accept the Report and were subsequently disfellowshipped participated in the re-organization of a new body, which was organized at a July 3, 2009, meeting in Troy, Ohio, called the Old German Baptist Brethren, New Conference. Several fundamental disagreements identified by the New Conference and adherents Charter-Agreement Old German Baptist Brethren Church (New Conference) included: allowing regular group Bible studies outside of the Sunday worship setting; permitting open outreach & mission efforts; use of email and the Internet; Scriptural application of church discipline as guided by Matthew 18; and preservation of the historical Brethren practice of \\"taking the voice\\" (or vote) of every member after a thorough discussion of each issue (no discussion was permitted upon presentation of the 2009 Report, and only a vote of affirmation was allowed). The New Conference Polity Statement,Polity Statement, Old German Baptist Brethren Church (New Conference) July 3, 2009 declares that \\"the church must never be elevated to a place of equality with Jesus Christ,\\" reflecting the New Conference's somewhat more individualistic approach to faith (in opposition to the parent body's stronger emphasis on unity through mutual practice and theology). The majority of the remainder of the departing members have joined similar existing groups such as the Old Brethren or Dunkard Brethren, or moved on to more mainstream church fellowships. Since the split, a few families who stood with the New Conference in 2009 have returned to their Old Conference membership, primarily in Ohio and Indiana, and several families have migrated to the New Conference from the Old since that time, primarily in Ohio, Indiana, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. =Recent events= Following the division of 2009, the majority that remained with the Old German Baptist Brethren (often referred to as the \\"Old Conference\\") decided at their 2010 Annual Conference to continue the ban on email and the internet. They agreed to allow very limited use for member businesses already online, with the understanding that they discontinue use within three years.Minutes of the Annual Meeting of The Old German Baptist Brethren Church May 22‚Äì25, 2010. Published by \\"The Vindicator\\". To date, the subsequent queries again requesting some form of business use have been met with a discussions ending in reaffirmation of the 2010 decision. As of 2015, there is a group of nine brethren working autonomously with outside communications companies to arrange a \\"third party\\" system to allow their members access to needed online information without actually using the World Wide Web themselves. An increasing adherence to traditional patterns of dress and practice has also become significantly more evident among the remaining conservative membership. A trickle of members moving to the more traditional horse and buggy groups (primarily Old Brethren German Baptist) may also have slowed. Increasing conservatism in the Old German Baptist Brethren has also had a bearing on the decision of a majority of the former members of the Philip Hess faction of the German Baptist Brethren to join the Old Conference of the Old German Baptist Brethren after the dissolution of that group in September‚ÄìOctober 2010.\\"The Vindicator\\" The increasing conservatism since the 2009 division was not sufficient for the majority of the Gene Wagoner faction of the German Baptist Brethren to move to the Old German Baptist Brethren upon the dissolution of that group in spring of 2012, although several of them did reunite with the parent body Old German Baptist Brethren Church prior to the 2012 Annual Conference. Several of the former members of that faction have joined the small migration of former Old German Baptist Brethren moving to Trenton, MO and have united with them in the more traditional horse and buggy Old Brethren German Baptist group.\\"The Vindicator\\" After a controversial 2015 Annual Meeting decision regarding the filtered \\"Brethren Resource Group\\" Internet service, some 10 districts (congregations) sent queries to Annual Meeting in 2016 asking for the decision to be reversed. There was also opposition to the procedure used at the 2015 meeting. While the procedure question was laid down and the Internet question deferred for one year, there is once again open discussion of a division due to the controversy and disunion between the old order branches of the church with their strength in Pennsylvania, California, and Wisconsin, and the progressives, whose strength is in Indiana and Ohio. Theology In general, the theological position of the OGBB can be diverse, and often represented geographically. A Doctrinal Treatise was published in 1952, primarily for the sake of young men who went abroad in Civilian Public Service camps or other work programs, and it presents many doctrinal distinctives of the OGBB; however it is not a creed or formal statement of faith to which members must subscribe, as members interpret and apply some of its various theological points differently. When asked for a creed, most Old German Baptist Brethren claim that the New Testament is the closest thing they have to a creed. Generally, the OGBB believe in Free Will, and that faith and baptism in the Lord Jesus Christ is required for salvation, to be followed by a life of literal obedience to His word (the result of that faith). When there is a question of applications for a specific issue or area of life for which Scripture has no clear mandate, the members gather once a year at their Annual Meeting and consider the issue in light of Scripture, past practices, and current contexts, then voice (or vote) on it. While the Brethren strive for unanimity in any decision, that is difficult to achieve, and often the vote is decided by a very strong majority voice. If such cannot be reached, the issue is laid down (closed) or deferred until the following Annual Meeting. These decisions are kept on record as \\"Minutes of the Annual Meeting\\", and referred back to for consideration when there is any significant deviation from them. They touch on many things, including dress, technology, political involvement, and entertainment. The theological position of the OGBB was largely established by Peter Nead and William J. Shoup, both prolific Brethren authors and preachers. Nead, in particular, was a schooled Lutheran who converted to the Brethren and brought a refined system of teaching to the fellowship. Today the writings of Alexander Mack, R. H. Miller, Peter Nead, and the collected essays of Samuel Kinsey, along with the collected articles of the group's monthly periodical, \\"The Vindicator\\", form their most important doctrinal writings. A lively series of devotional and doctrinal essays continue to appear in the Vindicator each month. Ex-member Michael Hari contributed two widely circulated books of essays titled Brethren Thinking and One Faith in recent years.Michael Hari: Brethren Thinking, (2013) Bruderbote.Michael Hari: One Faith, (2015) Bruderbote. Religious practice The Old German Baptist Brethren historically believe in baptismal regeneration, placing the emphasis on the obedience of the new believer through faith, repentance, and baptism rather than a sacramental view that the water itself washes away sins. This is the official position of the church while individual members may differ somewhat in personal belief. They are noted for several ordinances like believer's baptism by trine immersion, feet washing, the love feast, a communion of unleavened bread and wine, the holy kiss, and anointing of the sick with oil. Baptism is by trine- and forward- immersion in water. They hold an Annual Meeting associated with Pentecost, and cooperate in publishing a monthly periodical, The Vindicator. The Old German Baptist Brethren are a non- resistant sect, whose young men usually file as conscientious objectors in times of war. Members of the church do not believe in defending themselves against physical attacks outside of war, either. Members do not file lawsuits, defend themselves against lawsuits, or use liens to collect debts. =Worship= The form of worship is fairly consistent from church to church, with a cappella singing, kneeling in prayer, sermons by congregationally elected ministers (called the plural ministry because of having several ministers in each congregation), and provision for divided seating with women and men assembled on opposite sides of the meetinghouse. The Old German Baptist Brethren use their own hymn book, of which most members maintain a personal copy. The hymns were written by both Old German Baptist Brethren members and many well-known authors from the 18th and 19th centuries. The style of singing is generally started and led by a congregationally-elected deacon, and is slow, usually in 4 part harmony or unison. The more conservative in practice a district may be, the slower the singing tends to be, though the difference may not be immediately obvious to visitors. The singing is similar to that of River Brethren or Old Order Mennonites. =Plain dress= The Old German Baptist Brethren dress plain. The women's dress is similar to the dress patterns of River Brethren or Old Order Mennonites, like the \\"Joe Wengers\\" (Groffdale Conference Mennonite Church) or the Beachy Amish: one-piece dresses and head coverings. Many of the men wear beards, plain coats and often black hats.Donald B. Kraybill and Carl D. Bowman: On the Backroad to Heaven: Old Order Hutterites, Mennonites, Amish, and Brethren, (2001) Johns Hopkins University Press, page 145. The beard, worn without the mustache, is required for the ministry, and encouraged but not required for laity. =Restrictions on technology= There are no radios, televisions sets, stereos, tape recorders, VCRs, or large musical instruments in members' homes.Donald B. Kraybill and Carl D. Bowman: On the Backroad to Heaven: Old Order Hutterites, Mennonites, Amish, and Brethren, (2001) Johns Hopkins University Press, page 145. There has been a long debate over the use of the internet since the mid-90s; contrary to various reports, it was not the primary catalyst for the split in 2009 (see above paragraph on 2009 division). Members and congregations According to the 2009 Directory of Officials,The Old German Baptist Brethren Church January 2009 Directory of Officials, Miami Valley Press, Inc. the Old German Baptist Brethren had 6,149 members in 56 churches at the end of 2008, although this number was reduced to approximately 3600 members after the 2009 Annual Meeting Report which led to the organization of the Old German Baptist Brethren (New Conference). The largest concentration of congregations is in Ohio (16), followed by Indiana (9), California (4), Kansas (5), Pennsylvania (5), Virginia (4), Washington (3), Florida (2), Wisconsin (2), Georgia (1), Michigan (1), Missouri (1), Montana (1), Oregon (1) and West Virginia (1). Almost 54% of the members live in Ohio and Indiana.Donald B. Kraybill and Carl D. Bowman: On the Backroad to Heaven: Old Order Hutterites, Mennonites, Amish, and Brethren, (2001) Johns Hopkins University Press, page 141. The numbers above refer to the Old German Baptist Brethren before the split in 2009. In 2016 the Old German Baptist Brethren had about 4,000 members. References * Charles D.

Biography  Dyson was born in Measham, near Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, the son of the Rev Watson Dyson, a Baptist minister, and his wife, Frances Dodwell. They moved to Yorkshire in his youth. There he attended Heath Grammar School, Halifax, and subsequently won scholarships to Bradford Grammar School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied mathematics and astronomy, being placed Second Wrangler in 1889. In 1894 he was given the post of Senior Assistant at Greenwich Observatory and worked on the Astrographic Catalogue, which was published in 1905. He was appointed Astronomer Royal for Scotland from 1905 to 1910, and Astronomer Royal (and Director of the Royal Greenwich Observatory) from 1910 to 1933. In 1928, he introduced in the Observatory a new free-pendulum clock, the most accurate clock available at that time and organised the regular wireless transmission from the GPO wireless station at Rugby of Greenwich Mean Time. He also, in 1924, introduced the distribution of the \\"six pips\\" via the BBC. He was for several years President of the British Horological Institute and was awarded their gold medal in 1928. Dyson was noted for his study of solar eclipses and was an authority on the spectrum of the corona and on the chromosphere. He is credited with organising expeditions to observe the 1919 solar eclipse at Brazil and Principe, which he somewhat optimistically began preparing for prior to the Armistice of 11 November 1918. Dyson presented his observations of the solar eclipse of May 29, 1919 to a joint meeting of the Royal Society and Royal Astronomical Society on 6 November 1919. The observations confirmed Albert Einstein's theory of the effect of gravity on light which until that time had been received with some scepticism by the scientific community. Dyson died on board a ship while travelling from Australia to England in 1939 and was buried at sea.

Frank Dyson and Freeman Dyson Although Frank Dyson and theoretical physicist Freeman Dyson are not known to be related, their fathers Rev Watson Dyson and George Dyson both hailed from West Yorkshire where the surname originates and is most densely clustered.

It was borrowed into English from French (older French spellings were Reimund and Raimund, whereas the modern English and French spellings are identical). It originated as the Germanic Raginmund or Reginmund. Ragin (Old German) and regin (Gothic) meant \\"counsel\\". The Old High German mund originally meant \\"hand\\", but came to mean \\"protection\\". This etymology suggests that the name originated in the Early Middle Ages, possibly from Latin. Despite the German and French origins of the English name, some of its early uses in English documents appear in Latinized form. As a surname, its first recorded appearance in Britain appeared in 1086, during the reign of William the Conqueror, in the Domesday Book, with a reference to Giraldus Reimundus.

Rupert's initial purpose was to win sales from the rival Daily Mail and Daily Mirror. In 1935, the stories were taken over by Alfred Bestall, who was previously an illustrator for Punch and other glossy magazines. Bestall proved to be successful in the field of children's literature and worked on Rupert stories and artwork into his 90s. More recently, various other artists and writers have continued the series. About 50 million copies have been sold worldwide. The comic strip was, and still is, published daily in the Daily Express, with many of these stories later being printed in books, and every year since 1936 a Rupert annual has also been released. Rupert Bear has become a well-known character in children's culture in the United Kingdom, and the success of the Rupert stories has led to the creation of several television series based on the character. The character also has a large fan following, with such groups as The Followers of Rupert. Characters and story Rupert is a bear who lives with his parents in a house in Nutwood, a fictional idyllic English village. He is drawn wearing a red sweater and bright yellow checked trousers, with matching yellow scarf. Originally depicted as a brown bear, his colour soon changed to white to save on printing costs, though he remained brown on the covers of the annuals. Most of the other characters in the series are also anthropomorphic animals (animals with humanoid forms). They are all scaled to be about the same size as Rupert, regardless of species. Rupert's animal friends are usually referred to as his \\"chums\\" or \\"pals.\\" Aside from his best friend Bill Badger, some of the most enduring pals are an elephant (Edward Trunk), a mouse (Willie), Pong-Ping the Pekingese, Algy Pug (who actually pre-dates Rupert),George Perry and Alfred Bestall, Rupert, A bear's Life, Pavilion Books: 1985, p. 18 Podgy Pig, Bingo the Brainy Pup, Freddie and Ferdy Fox, the identical twins Reggie and Rex Rabbit, and Ming the dragon. The kindly Wise Old Goat also lives in Nutwood, and helps Rupert in some of his adventures. One of the most unusual and evocative characters is Raggety, a woodland troll-creature made from twigs, who is often very grumpy and annoying. In the 2006 television revival of the series, Raggety has been transformed into a friendly elf with broken English. There is also a recurring country Police Officer who is an adult dog named PC Growler.Rupert Bear Annuals There are also a few human characters in the stories, such as the Professor (who lives in a castle with his servant, Bodkin), Tiger Lily (a Chinese girl), her father \\"the Conjuror,\\" and several less frequently occurring characters such as Sailor Sam, Gaffer Jarge, Captain Binnacle and Rollo, the Gypsy boy. There is also a recurring Merboy. During his time as Rupert writer, Alfred Berstall added further characters such as the girl guides Beryl, Pauline and Janet, with Beryl's cat, Dinky. These characters were based on Girl Guides from Bestall's own church who asked him in late 1947 if they could have their own adventure with Rupert. They remain part of the comic series even today. The series often features fantastic and magical adventures in faraway lands. Each story begins in Nutwood, where Rupert usually sets out on a small errand for his mother or to visit a friend, which then develops into an adventure to an exotic place such as King Frost's Castle, the Kingdom of the Birds, underground, or to the bottom of the sea. Sometimes one of the Professor's inventions opens the door to one of Rupert's adventures. At the end of the story Rupert returns to Nutwood, where all is safe and well, and where his parents seem perfectly sanguine about his adventures. Style Unlike most modern comic strips, Rupert Bear has always been produced in the original form of strip with illustrations accompanying text, called \\"text comics\\", as opposed to text being incorporated into the art in speech bubbles etc. Bestall developed the classic Rupert story format: the story is told in picture form (generally two panels each day in the newspaper and four panels to a page in the annuals), in simple page-headers, in simple two-line-per-image verse and then as running prose at the foot. Rupert Annuals can therefore be \\"read\\" on four levels. He also established the shape and form of the Rupert stories. Rupert Bear is recognizable in his red jumper and yellow checked trousers and scarf History Rupert's unspectacular debut was in a single panel, the first of 36 episodes of the story \\"Little Lost Bear\\" written and drawn by Tourtel. Bestall expanded the stories and plots of Rupert; and in addition to precise and detailed drawings for the Daily Express panels he also created beautifully crafted illustrations in the Rupert Annuals. Bestall drew the Rupert stories for the Daily Express until 1965; and continued to illustrate the covers for the annuals until his retirement in 1973. Much of the landscape in Rupert is inspired by the Vale of Clwyd in North Wales (Alfred Bestall himself lived for many years in the north Welsh village of Beddgelert)Bedgellert village history(the Professor's castle is based on Ruthin Castle), the Sussex Weald and East Devon. Bestall's successor was Alex Cubie. Cubie created Rupert annual artwork between 1974 and 1977. His images are recognisable from the thicker black outlines around the characters and the use of more vibrant colours than Bestall employed. A Rupert Annual is still produced every year and Rupert appears each day in the Daily Express. In 1978 his new adventures became illustrated by John Harrold; his drawings in the annual were usually coloured by Gina Hart. In 2008 John Harrold was succeeded by Stuart Trotter and a new style of annual (sans serif typeface) with a more modern Rupert to tie-in with the CGI-animation Rupert Bear, Follow the Magic..., began. The Rupert Annual for 1960 contained a story called Rupert and the Diamond Leaf, in which he visits \\"Coon Island\\", whose inhabitants are little \\"Coons\\". The Coons previously appeared on the cover of The New Rupert: The Daily Express Annual, 1954 and in the interior story Rupert and the Castaway. The first appearance was in the 1946 soft cover summer special Rupert on Coon Island. Rupert appeared in Paul McCartney's 1984 music video \\"We All Stand Together\\"; McCartney also made an animated video starring Rupert called Rupert and the Frog Song. The short film, produced by McCartney won the British Academy Award. Rupert Bear exhibit formerly in the Canterbury Heritage Museum Tourtel's home was in Canterbury in Kent, and the Rupert Bear Museum, formerly part of the Canterbury Heritage Museum, which has since closed, had collections that covered much of the history of Rupert and his friends, as well as Tourtel and other illustrators. The museum was geared toward families and those interested in the general history of Rupert. On 31 October 2005, UK Media Group Entertainment Rights (which was later bought by Boomerang Media and then DreamWorks Animation) purchased a majority interest in the Rupert Bear character from the Daily Express. There are plans for a film, books, Limited Edition Prints and DVDs that will see Rupert joined by new friends in addition to established characters.

The characters were all puppets, although the opening sequence featured a toy Rupert bear sitting in a live-action child's bedroom. Rupert's friends and flying chariot appeared straight from the Daily Express pages, although he was joined by some new friends including a sprite called Willy Wisp. One of the most memorable elements of the series was the catchy theme song, written by Len Beadle (also known as Frank Weston) and Ron Roker, sung by Jackie Lee, which reached number 14 in the UK charts in 1971. The song included the erroneous lyric \\"Rupert the Bear\\" (Rupert has never officially had the definite article in his name). =Film adaptation: Rupert and the Frog Song= A short film directed by Geoff Dunbar based on ideas/music/songs by Paul McCartney was made in 1985, titled Rupert and the Frog Song. It follows Rupert as he explores the country one night and finds a special gathering of frogs. The film contains a song titled \\"We All Stand Together\\", written by McCartney and arranged by the Beatles' producer George Martin. =Rupert (1985‚Äì1988)= Rupert returned to television in 1985 to the BBC, in the form of 36 short five minute-stories. These were cartoons, but were not animated; instead each episode consisted of a series of still illustrations and narration. The sole narrator was Ray Brooks. The short title music is credited to Brave New World. In the US these shorts aired on the Disney Channel as part of its Lunchbox program. A selection of the episodes have been released on a number of VHS videos, no official DVD releases are so far available as of 2017. =Rupert (1991‚Äì1997)= In 1991, Rupert Bear got his own 2D cartoon British, French and Canadian animated television series with 65 episodes over five seasons (13 per season) produced by Nelvana (Canada), Ellipse (France) and Television South (TVS) for the first season (13 episodes), with Scottish TV taking over control from season 2 when Television South lost its ITV franchise. The show greatly followed the style and tone Bestall established in the Rupert newspaper series, with many of the stories being almost direct adaptations of his or others' panel stories from the Daily Express. It was broadcast in syndication on YTV in Canada. In the United States the show first aired on Nickelodeon before moving to CBS in January 1999; repeats of the series came to Qubo's digital service in January 2007. The show was broadcast in the UK on CITV. In Australia, the show was broadcast on the ABC and on TV2 in New Zealand as part of the Jason Gunn show. The series has been re-aired in the UK on the satellite and cable channel Tiny Pop. As of 2009 the show also airs daily on Qubo channel, although only the latter 26 episodes are currently being shown. In South America, the series was broadcast in Brazil by the TV Cultura channel between 1998 and 2008. According to the BBC News portal, in 2000 the Canadian producer Nelvana made plans to produce a feature film about Rupert at Hollywood studios, but the project was not implemented. =Rupert Bear, Follow The Magic... (2006‚Äì2008)= In 2006 a new Rupert Bear stop- motion-animated television series was produced, skewing almost entirely towards small children. Notable changes to the characters are that Rupert wears trainers/sneakers and his fur has a slight tan; Bill wears a dark blue leather jacket and blue pants with yellow stripes instead of his suit and bowtie, and tends to carry a personal digital assistant with him at all times; Pong Ping has become a girl who uses magic and had her name reversed; Raggety, who rarely appeared before, has become a friendly tree elf; Ming a baby dragon and Ping Pong's pet; Edward no longer has tusks, his trunk has been straightened and he wears an orange T-shirt and brown shorts; and one of the fox twins (Ferdie) has been changed into a girl named Freda. There are new characters like Miranda the mermaid; but characters Podgy Pig, his self- obsessed sister Rosalie and the timid Willie Mouse make no appearances. Rupert Bear, Follow The Magic ... was broadcast on Five from November 8, 2006 to February 1, 2008. Fifty-two ten-minute episodes were broadcast and subsequently repeated. Video games The British 1980s video games publisher Quicksilva adapted Rupert Bear for the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum 8-bit computers. This company published two game instalments, the 1985 Rupert and the Toymaker's Party and the 1986 Rupert and The Ice Castle. Stamps In September 2020, Royal Mail issued a set of eight stamps to commemorate the centenary of Rupert Bear. Featuring Bestall's artwork, they comprised two second-class stamps, two first-class, two at ¬£1.45 and two at ¬£1.70. In popular culture An episode of the series The Two Ronnies showed a parody sketch of Rupert Bear. It was titled \\"Rupert Baird\\" with Ronnie Corbett playing the part of Rupert and Ronnie Barker playing the role of a journalist/newsreporter. The whole of the dialogue in the sketch was composed of the rhyming prose that appears in the stories. The sketch also included the \\"Tell 'em about the honey Mummy\\" monster which at the time was a television advert.Television comedy series The Two Ronnies; Season 7: 1978‚Äì1979 The song \\"Band on the Run\\" mentions the character Sailor Sam, from the comics.

Early life Born Annie Mary Pryde Nicholson, she was the only daughter of the artists Sir William Nicholson and Mabel Pryde. She had three brothers, artist Ben Nicholson, architect Christopher Nicholson and Anthony, who was killed in action in 1918 in the First World War. Robert Graves Nancy married the poet Robert Graves in 1918. The following year, Graves started as a student in Oxford. The couple lived in a cottage on Boars Hill in Oxford, which they rented from the author John Masefield. In 1920, in partnership with a neighbour, The Hon. Mrs Michael Howard, Nancy set up a small grocer's shop, next door to the Masefields' house. Alarmed by the tourists it attracted, Mrs Masefield opposed its takeover by an Oxford firm, and the project collapsed after six months, leaving heavy debts settled only with the help of friends and family. In disgust, Graves and Nancy moved to the village of Islip, the other side of Oxford. A lifelong feminist, Nancy used to cycle to Oxfordshire villages and set up a stall to explain to women how to use contraception, when it was still illegal. Her open-mindedness led her to accept a triangular relationship, and from early 1926 Laura Riding lived with her and Graves in LondonDeborah Barker, In Extremis: The Life of Laura Riding (1993), p. 95.

It has many color varieties, and may also be kept for ornament.  History  The American Game was bred for cockfighting. The full-size (\\"large fowl\\") American Game is not recognized by the American Poultry Association, which in 2009 recognized the American Game Bantam in ten colors. The American Game is not among the fifty-three chicken breeds reported by the National Animal Germplasm Program of the USDA Agricultural Research Service to the DAD-IS database of the FAO, nor is it recognized by the Entente Europ√©enne d'Aviculture et de Cuniculture or by the Poultry Club of Great Britain.

It was created in New Jersey in the 1940s by a breeder named Frank Gary. He cross-bred the wild Red Jungle Fowl with fighting bantams of the type known at the time as \\"pit game\\". The American Game Bantam was listed in the yearbook of the American Bantam Association from 1950,, and was admitted to the Standard of Perfection of the American Poultry Association in 2009.  Characteristics  The standard-sized American Game is bred in a wide range of plumage colors; cock birds have long sickle feathers. The American Game Bantam has a small five-pointed single comb and small smooth wattles and earlobes. Ten color varieties are recognized by the APA: birchen; black; black-breasted red; blue; blue red; brown red; golden duckwing; red pyle; silver duckwing; and white. Two others, \\"brassy back\\" and wheaten, are also raised.  Use  The American Game was bred for cockfighting. It is a good table bird, and may be kept for ornament. Hens lay brown eggs.

ISO/IEC 8859-8 covers all the Hebrew letters, but no Hebrew vowel signs. IBM assigned code page 916 (CCSIDs 916 and 5012) to it.

ISO-8859-8 is the IANA preferred charset name for this standard when supplemented with the C0 and C1 control codes from ISO/IEC 6429.

A number of his paintings are in public collections, but there have been few exhibitions of his work. He is principally remembered as one of the Beggarstaffs, his artistic partnership with William Nicholson, and for the poster designs and other graphic work they made between 1893 and 1899, which had a powerful and far-reaching influence on graphic design for many years.  Life  James Ferrier \\"Jimmy\\" Pryde was born at 23 London Street, Edinburgh, on 30 March 1866. He was the only son of the six children of David Pryde (1834‚Äì1907), who was headmaster of Edinburgh Ladies' College from 1870 to 1891, and his wife Barbara n√©e Lauder (born 1833 or 1834), whose father William was a brother of the famous Scottish artists Robert Scott Lauder and James Eckford Lauder. The family moved to 10 Fettes Row, Edinburgh, in 1872. Pryde attended George Watson's Boys' College, and from 1885 to 1888 studied at the Royal Scottish Academy, where he had first exhibited in 1884. He was encouraged to paint by the Glasgow school painters James Guthrie and Edward Arthur Walton. In about 1899 he went to Paris to study under William-Adolphe Bouguereau at the Acad√©mie Julian, but the dismal and crowded atelier with its smell of tobacco smoke, stove-oil and human sweat did not please him, and after three months he returned to Scotland. In 1890 he went to London, and began to make pastel drawings in a style influenced by that of James McNeill Whistler. In 1899 Pryde married Marian Symons, a musician; their daughter Betty was born in 1903. The marriage ended in separation in 1914.  Work  In 1893 his sister Mabel married William Nicholson, four years after the two had met while studying at Hubert Herkomer's school of art in Bushey, in Hertfordshire. In the same year Pryde and Nicholson formed the Beggarstaff partnership, which lasted until 1899, and produced innovative poster designs and signboards. Between 1894 and 1899 Pryde tried his hand as an actor, playing small parts in several plays. Ellen Terry's son Edward Gordon Craig, with whom Pryde toured Scotland in 1895, described 'Jimmy' as 'one of the best painters who ever lived' and 'one of the biggest hearts on earth'. But Craig had no illusions about Pryde's dramatic ability: > as an actor he never really existed: but the idea of acting, the idea of the > theatre ‚Äì or rather the smell of the place, meant a lot to him. Yes, I think > he got much 'inspiration' from the boards ‚Äì and the thought and feel of it > all, as of a magical place ... He was an associate of the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers from 1901 and Vice-President in 1921. His first one-man exhibition was held at the Baillie Gallery in 1911. He also exhibited at the Goupil Gallery, the Leicester Galleries, the Grosvenor Gallery, London Salon, New English Art Club, Royal Hibernian Academy, Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts and Royal Scottish Academy. In 1934 he was elected an honorary member of the Royal Institute of Oil Painters. His only work as a theatre designer was for a production at the Savoy Theatre of Othello in 1930. He became ill in 1939, and died on 24 February 1941 in St Mary Abbots Hospital in Kensington. He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium.  Reception  Pryde did not belong to any artistic school or movement. His work was highly regarded in his lifetime; in 1922 Frank Rutter, in his Some Contemporary Artists, described him as \\"stupendous\\". He had only two one-man shows, in 1911 at the Baillie Gallery and in 1933 at the Leicester Galleries. In 1949 an Arts Council Memorial Exhibition toured Edinburgh, Brighton and London. His work as a painter received little subsequent attention until 1992, when an exhibition was held at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh.

Elected as the first (1848‚Äì1856) and seventh (1872‚Äì1876) President of Liberia after independence, he was the first man of African descent to govern the country, serving previously as governor from 1841 to 1848. Born free in Norfolk, Virginia, Roberts emigrated as a young man with his mother, siblings, wife, and child to the young West African colony. He opened a trading firm in Monrovia and later engaged in politics. After Liberia became independent on July 26, 1847, Roberts was elected as the nation's first president, serving until 1856. In 1872, he was elected again to serve as Liberia's seventh president. Early life Joseph Jenkins Roberts was born free in Norfolk, Virginia, the second-oldest of seven children. His father was said to be a planter of Welsh origin. Joseph's mother Amelia, described as a \\"mulatto\\" who was quite fair, was the planter's slave mistress or concubine, and he freed her when she was still young, before Joseph was born. Amelia gave all but one of her children the middle name of Jenkins, which suggests that was likely the surname of their biological father. After receiving her freedom, Amelia moved and married James Roberts, a free man of color. Roberts gave her children his surname and raised them as his own. Roberts owned a boating business on the James River. By the time of his death, he had acquired substantial wealth for a free man of color at the time. Joseph Roberts and his siblings were estimated to be of seven-eighths European ancestry. The Liberian historian Abayomi Karnga explained in 1926: \\"He was not really black; he was an octoroon and could have easily passed for a white man.\\" However, his native Virginia classed him as a person of color because he was born to a mother of African descent. The family moved to Petersburg, an industrial city on the upper James River with a substantial population of free people of color. As a boy, Joseph began to work in his stepfather's business, handling goods on a flatboat that transported materials from Petersburg to Norfolk, Virginia on the James River.. Shortly after the family relocated, his stepfather James Roberts died. Joseph continued to work in his family's business, but also served as an apprentice in a barber shop. The owner of the barber shop, William Colson, was also a minister and one of Virginia's best-educated black residents. He gave Roberts access to his private library, which provided much of the youth's early education. Marriage and family In 1828, Roberts married an 18-year-old woman named Sarah. They had an infant child whom they took with them when they emigrated the next year to the new colony of Liberia under the auspices of the American Colonization Society. Both Sarah and the child died in the first year of living in the colony.Mary Tyler-McGraw, \\"The Roberts Family\\", 2008, Virginia Emigrants to Liberia, Virginia Center for Digital History, University of Virginia, accessed 4 Jun 2010 There was a very high rate of mortality due to disease among settlers to the new colony. Some time after his wife's death, Roberts married again, to Jane Rose Waring, in 1836 in Monrovia, Liberia. She was a daughter of Colston Waring and Harriet Graves, other Virginians who had emigrated to the colony.Mary Tyler-McGraw, \\"The Roberts Family\\" and \\"Harriet Graves: Reluctant Founding Mother\\", 2008, Virginia Emigrants to Liberia, Virginia Center for Digital History, University of Virginia, accessed 4 Jun 2010 Emigrating to Liberia Daguerreotype likely taken between 1840 and 1860. After hearing about the American Colonization Society's efforts in creating the colony of Liberia on the West African coast, Roberts decided to join a group of fellow Virginians preparing to leave for Monrovia, the capital of the young colony. Although Roberts was educated and a relatively successful merchant by the time he and his family emigrated, the restrictions in Virginia on free people of color played an important role in his decision. The Roberts family was deeply religious, and they felt called to evangelize the indigenous peoples of Africa. On February 9, 1829, they sailed for Africa on the ship Harriet,\\"Search Emigrants\\", Virginia Emigrants to Liberia, Virginia Center for Digital History, University of Virginia, accessed 4 Jun 2010 along with Roberts's mother and five of his six siblings. Another passenger on the same ship was James Spriggs Payne, who later became a leader and was elected as Liberia's fourth president. Several years before leaving for Liberia, Roberts established a business with his friend William Nelson Colson from Petersburg. Known as Roberts, Colson, & Company, the partnership continued and even expanded after Roberts emigrated, exporting palm products, camwood, and ivory to the United States and trading American goods at a company store in Monrovia. Roberts made several trips to the United States, including stops in New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond as a representative of the firm. In 1835, Colson emigrated to Liberia, but died shortly after his arrival. Expanding into coastal trade, the Roberts family became successful members of the local establishment. During this time, Joseph's brother, John Wright Roberts, entered the ministry of the Liberian Methodist Church. Later he became a bishop. After starting as a trader, the youngest brother, Henry Roberts, studied medicine at the Berkshire Medical College in Massachusetts. Joseph Roberts was successful enough to pay for his brother's tuition. Henry returned to Liberia to work as a physician. In 1833, Joseph Roberts became high sheriff of the colony. One of his responsibilities was to organize militias to travel to the interior to collect taxes from the indigenous peoples and put down their raids against areas under colonial rule. In 1839, the American Colonization Society appointed Roberts as vice governor. Two years later, after the death of governor Thomas Buchanan, Roberts was appointed as the first African-American governor of Liberia. In 1846, Roberts asked the legislature to declare the independence of Liberia, but also to maintain cooperation with the American Colonization Society. The legislature called for a referendum, in which voters chose independence. On July 26, 1847, a group of eleven delegates declared Liberia independent. He won the first presidential election on October 5, 1847, and was sworn into office on January 3, 1848, with Nathaniel Brander as vice president. First presidency (1847‚Äì1856) Roberts was re-elected three more times to serve a total of eight years, until he lost the election in 1855 to Vice President Benson. Attempts to found a state based upon some 3,000 settlers proved difficult. Some coastal ethnic groups were converted to Christianity and learned English, but most of the indigenous Africans of the area retained their traditional religions and languages. They also continued to take part in the Atlantic Slave Trade operated by European slavers along the coast. The slave trade continued illegally from ports along the Liberian coast, but the British Royal Navy along with that of the United States finally helped to close it down in the 1850s. =Foreign relations= Lithograph of the former home of Joseph Roberts in Monrovia Roberts spent the first year of his presidency attempting to attain recognition from the United States, where it was opposed mainly by southern Congressmen as well as several European nations with neighboring colonies. In 1848 he traveled to Europe to meet Queen Victoria and other heads of state. The UK was the first country to recognize Liberia as an independent country,The Times, London. Jul 10, 1962; pg. 11; Issue 55439 followed by France in 1848 or 1852 (accounts differ). In 1849, the German cities of Hamburg, Bremen and L√ºbeck recognized the new nation, as did Portugal, Brazil, the Kingdom of Sardinia, and the Austrian Empire. Norway and Sweden did so in either 1849 or 1863, Haiti in either 1849 or 1864, Denmark in either 1849 or 1869 (accounts differ). The United States withheld recognition until February 5, 1862, during the presidency of Abraham Lincoln. Reportedly, the government had had reservations over the political and social statuses of black diplomats in Washington, D.C. Soon after the recognition of Liberia's independence, slavery was abolished in Washington, D.C. =Relations with Indigenous Groups= In 1854 Maryland Colony, which was established adjacent to Liberia, declared its independence from the Maryland State Colonization Society but did not become part of the Republic of Liberia. It held the land along the coast between the Grand Cess and San Pedro rivers. In 1856, it requested military aid from Liberia in a war with the Grebo and Kru peoples. The latter were resisting the Maryland colonists' efforts to control their trade in slaves and other goods. Roberts assisted the Maryland colony, and a joint military campaign by the two groups of African-American colonists resulted in victory. In 1857, the year after Roberts left office for the first time, the Republic of Maryland joined Liberia as Maryland County. During his presidency, Roberts expanded the borders of Liberia along the coast and made attempts to assimilate the indigenous people surrounding Monrovia into Americo-Liberian culture, largely through directed education and religious conversion. =Economy, nation building= The settlers built schools and Liberia College (which later became the University of Liberia). During these early years, agriculture, shipbuilding, and trade flourished. =Assessment= Roberts has been described as a talented leader with diplomatic skills. His leadership was instrumental in gaining independence and sovereignty for Liberia. Later in his career, his diplomatic skills helped him to deal effectively with the indigenous peoples and to maneuver in the complex field of international law and relations. Between presidencies Painted portrait from 1871. After his first presidency, Roberts served for fifteen years as a major general in the Liberian Army, as well as a diplomatic representative of the nation to France and Great Britain. In 1862, he co-founded Liberia College in Monrovia, where he served as its first president until 1876.Livingston, Thomas W. ‚ÄúThe Exportation of American Higher Education to West Africa: Liberia College, 1850-1900‚Äù.

In 1871, President Edward James Roye was deposed by elements loyal to the Republican Party on the grounds that he was planning to cancel the upcoming elections. Roberts, one of the Republican Party's leaders, won the ensuing presidential election and returned to office in 1872. He served for two terms until 1876. While Roberts was incapacitated by illness from 1875 until early 1876, Vice President Anthony W. Gardiner served as acting president. In the 1860s and 1870s, escalating economic difficulties weakened Monrovia's dominance over the coastal indigenous populations, leading to several violent conflicts. Conditions worsened following Roberts's second presidency, as the cost of imports was far greater than the income generated by exports of coffee, rice, palm oil, sugar cane, camwood, and timber. Inheritance and legacy Roberts died on February 24, 1876, less than two months after his final term as president ended. In his will, he left $10,000 and his estate to the educational system of Liberia. Today, Liberia's main airport, Roberts International Airport, as well as the town of Robertsport and Roberts Street in Monrovia are named in his honor. His face is depicted on the Liberian ten dollar bill, introduced in 2000, and the old five dollar bill in circulation between 1989 and 1999. His birthday, March 15, is a national holiday in Liberia.

It suggests that costly signals must be reliable signals, costing the signaller something that could not be afforded by an individual with less of a particular trait. For example, in sexual selection, the theory suggests that animals of greater biological fitness signal this status through handicapping behaviour, or morphology that effectively lowers this quality. The central idea is that sexually selected traits function like conspicuous consumption, signalling the ability to afford to squander a resource. Receivers then know that the signal indicates quality, because inferior quality signallers are unable to produce such wastefully extravagant signals. History The handicap principle was proposed in 1975 by Israeli biologist Amotz Zahavi. The generality of the phenomenon is the matter of some debate and disagreement, and Zahavi's views on the scope and importance of handicaps in biology have not been accepted by the mainstream.Review by Nevertheless, the idea has been very influential,Maynard Smith, J. and Harper, D. (2003) Animal Signals. Oxford University Press. . with most researchers in the field believing that the theory explains some aspects of animal communication. Handicap models Johnstone's 1997 graphical representation of a Zahavian handicap. Where C_L is cost to a low-quality signaller and C_H is cost to a high-quality signaller. Optimal signalling levels are S^*_L for a low-quality signaller, and S^*_H for a high-quality signaller. Though the handicap principle was initially controversial,‚ÄîJohn Maynard Smith being one notable early critic of Zahavi's ideas‚Äîit has gained wider acceptance because it is supported by game theoretic models, most notably Alan Grafen's signalling game model. This is essentially a rediscovery of Michael Spence's job market signalling model, where the job applicant signals their quality by declaring a costly education. In Grafen's model, the courting male's quality is signalled by investment in an extravagant trait‚Äîsuch as the peacock's tail. In both cases, the signal is reliable if the cost to the signaller of producing it is proportionately lower for higher-quality signallers than it is for lower-quality signallers (Fig. 2). Having read Grafen's mathematical modeling, Smith accepted the validity of the Handicap Principle. A series of papers by Thomas Getty shows that Grafen's proof of the handicap principle depends on the critical simplifying assumption that signalers trade off costs for benefits in an additive fashion, the way humans invest money to increase income in the same currency. This is illustrated in the figures to the right, from Johnstone 1997. The validity of this assumption has been contested, in its application to the survival cost‚Äìreproduction benefit trade-off that is assumed to mediate the evolution of sexually selected signals. It can be reasoned that as fitness depends on the production of offspring, this is therefore a multiplicative function, not an additive function, of reproductive success. Further formal game theoretical signalling models demonstrated the evolutionary stability of handicapped signals in nestlings' begging calls, in predator-deterrent signals and in threat-displays. In the classic handicapped models of begging, all players are assumed to pay the same amount to produce a signal of a given level of intensity, but differ in the relative value of eliciting the desired response (donation) from the receiver (Fig. 3). The hungrier the baby bird, the more food is of value to it, and the higher the optimal signalling level (the louder its chirping). Counter-examples to handicap models predate handicap models themselves. Models of signals (such as threat displays) without any handicapping costs show that conventional signalling may be evolutionarily stable in biological communication. Analysis of some begging models also shows that, in addition to the handicapped outcomes, non-communication strategies are not only evolutionarily stable, but lead to higher payoffs for both players. Mathematical analyses including Monte Carlo simulations suggest that costly traits used in mate choice by humans should be generally less common and more attractive to the other sex than non-costly traits. Generality and empirical examples The theory predicts that a sexual ornament, or any other signal, such as visibly risky behavior, must be costly if it is to accurately advertise a trait of relevance to an individual with conflicting interests. Typical examples of handicapped signals include bird songs, the peacock's tail, courtship dances, and bowerbird bowers. Jared Diamond has proposed that certain risky human behaviours, such as bungee jumping, may be expressions of instincts that have evolved through the operation of the handicap principle. Zahavi has invoked the potlatch ceremony as a human example of the handicap principle in action. This interpretation of potlatch can be traced to Thorstein Veblen's use of the ceremony in his book Theory of the Leisure Class as an example of \\"conspicuous consumption\\". The handicap principle gains further support by providing interpretations for behaviours that fit into a single unifying gene-centered view of evolution and making earlier explanations based on group selection obsolete. A classic example is that of stotting in gazelles. This behaviour consists in the gazelle initially running slowly and jumping high when threatened by a predator such as a lion or cheetah. The explanation based on group selection was that such behaviour might be adapted to alerting other gazelle to a cheetah's presence or might be part of a collective behaviour pattern of the group of gazelle to confuse the cheetah. Instead, Zahavi proposed that each gazelle was communicating that it was a fitter individual than its fellows. This may communicate to the cheetah to avoid chasing this fitter individual, or the message may be oriented toward the other gazelles, which would indicate its fitness to potential mates. Immunocompetence handicaps The theory of immunocompetence handicaps suggests that androgen-mediated traits accurately signal condition due to the immunosuppressive effects of androgens. This immunosuppression may be either because testosterone alters the allocation of limited resources between the development of ornamental traits and other tissues, including the immune system, or because heightened immune system activity has a propensity to launch autoimmune attacks against gametes, such that suppression of the immune system enhances fertility. Healthy individuals can afford to suppress their immune system by raising their testosterone levels, which also augments secondary sexual traits and displays. A review of empirical studies into the various aspects of this theory found weak support. Examples =Directed at members of the same species= Luxury cars and other \\"Veblen goods\\" may be an example of the handicap principle in humans Zahavi studied in particular the Arabian babbler, a very social bird, with a life-length of 30 years, which was considered to have altruistic behaviors. The helping-at-the-nest behavior often occurs among unrelated individuals, and therefore cannot be explained by kin selection. Zahavi reinterpreted these behaviours according to his signal theory and its correlative, the handicap principle. The altruistic act is costly to the donor, but may improve its attractiveness to potential mates. The evolution of this condition may be explained by competitive altruism.Zahavi, A. (1990). \\"Arabian Babblers: The quest for social status in a cooperative Breeder\\", pp. 105‚Äì130 in Cooperative Breeding in Birds, P. B. Stacey and W. D. Koenig (eds.), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom Research by Patrice David on the stalk-eyed fly species Cyrtodiopsis dalmanni has demonstrated that genetic variation underlies the response to environmental stress, such as variable food quality, or of male sexual ornaments, such as increased eye span. David demonstrated that some male genotypes develop large eye spans under all conditions, whereas other genotypes progressively reduce eye spans as environmental conditions deteriorate. Several non-sexual traits, including female eye span and male and female wing length, also show condition-dependent expression, but their genetic response is entirely explained by scaling with body size. Unlike these characteristics, male eye span still reveals genetic variation in response to environmental stress after accounting for differences in body size. Thus, David inferred that these results strongly support the conclusion that female mate choice yields genetic benefits for offspring as eye span acts as a truthful indicator of male fitness. Eye span is therefore not only selected on the basis of attractiveness, but also because it demonstrates good genes in mates. An example in humans was suggested by Geoffrey Miller who expressed that Veblen goods such as luxury cars and other forms of conspicuous consumption are manifestations of the handicap principle, being used to advertise \\"fitness\\", in the form of wealth and status, to potential mates. Obesity, a sign of ability to procure or afford plenty of food, comes at the expense of health, agility, and in more advanced cases, even strength; in cultures that experience food scarcity, this exhibits \\"fitness\\" to the opposite sex and is also often associated with wealth. Recent cultural changes have altered this perception, particularly in western societies. =Directed at other species= Impala stotting, a behavior that may signal to predators that a pursuit would be wasted The signal receiver need not be a conspecific of the sender, however. Signals may also be directed at predators, with the function of showing that pursuit will probably be unprofitable. Stotting, for instance, is a sort of hopping that certain gazelles do when they sight a predator. As this behavior gives no evident benefit and would seem to waste resources (diminishing the gazelle's head start if chased by the predator), it was a puzzle until handicap theory offered an explanation. According to this analysis, if the gazelle simply invests a little energy to show a lion that it has the fitness necessary to avoid capture, it may not have to evade the lion in an actual pursuit. The lion, faced with the demonstration of fitness, might decide that it will not catch this gazelle, and thus, avoid a wasted pursuit. The benefit to the gazelle is twofold. First, for the small amount of energy invested in the stotting, the gazelle might not have to expend the tremendous energy required to evade the lion. Second, if the lion is in fact capable of catching this gazelle, the gazelle's bluff leads to its survival that day. Another example is provided by larks, some of which discourage merlins by sending a similar message: they sing while being chased, telling their predator that they will be difficult to capture.

He also owned the Kona Kai motel in Las Vegas, which later became the Klondike Hotel and Casino. He was also the donor for the construction of the $104 million Ralph Engelstad Arena for his alma mater, the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and another arena bearing his name in Thief River Falls, Minnesota. Engelstad was also a co- developer of the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Engelstad was one of the very few independent casino-hotel owners in Las Vegas. Early years Engelstad was born on January 28, 1930, in Thief River Falls, Minnesota. He was one of five children born to Christian and Madeline (Thill) Engelstad. His grandfather, Peter was a Norwegian immigrant from Vang, Hedmark. During high school, Engelstad worked a summer job at AGSCO farm supply company, where his father was a salesman. It was usually long and hard work, taking place on farms and requiring the workers to assemble steel buildings from morning to night. In 1954, he graduated from the University of North Dakota (UND) with a degree in Business. While at UND, Engelstad also played goalie for the school hockey team and even received a tryout with the Chicago Blackhawks. After graduation, he went on to marry Betty Stocker of East Grand Forks. The two went on to have a daughter, Kris.  Business career  In the 1950s, Engelstad founded his own construction company: Engelstad Construction. Engelstad became a millionaire at the age of twenty-nine, fulfilling his hope to become a millionaire by the age of thirty. In 1959, he moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, where his construction company had secured government contracts to build FHA homes. In 1965, he purchased the Thunderbird Field airport and later acquired vacant land nearby. In 1967, he sold 145 acres, including the airport, to billionaire Howard Hughes for $2 million. Engelstad used the money to purchase the Kona Kai motel on the Las Vegas Strip. He sold the motel in 1975 for $1.2 million, and it would later become the Klondike Hotel and Casino. In 1971, he purchased the Flamingo Capri Motel, also on the Las Vegas Strip. He added a casino in 1972, and later renamed the property to the Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino in 1979. By 1989, he was worth an estimated $300 million. In 1997, he opened a second Imperial Palace resort in Biloxi, Mississippi.Imperial Palace owner Engelstad dies. Liz Benston, Las Vegas Sun, November 27, 2002. In 1996, Engelstad joined with Bill Bennett (owner of the Sahara Hotel and Casino) to build the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, which they later sold to Speedway Motorsports in 1998. Philanthropy The Engelstad Foundation was created in 2002 by Ralph and Betty Engelstad.

He raised accusations of being sympathetic to Nazism owing to his collection of Nazi memorabilia stored in a private room, which he referred to as his \\"war room\\", within his Imperial Palace hotel-casino. After discovery of the memorabilia, Engelstad agreed to sell it rather than put it on display. In an apology letter to the Jewish Federation of Las Vegas, Engelstad said \\"I now feel I have done what I can and apologized for what I cannot do\\". In addition to the memorabilia he stored on display in his \\"war room\\", a printing plate was found within his hotel that was used to make bumper stickers that read \\"Hitler Was Right\\". =Hitler birthday parties= On April 20 in 1986 and 1988, he hosted parties to celebrate Adolf Hitler's birthday at his casino in Las Vegas People that featured bartenders in T-shirts reading \\"Adolf Hitler -- European tour 1939-45\\". Because of this, in 1989, the Nevada Gaming Commission fined Engelstad $1.5 million \\"for actions that damaged the reputation and image of Nevada's gaming industry.\\" Engelstad apologized publicly for the parties, saying they were \\"stupid, insensitive and held in bad taste\\", but the row was not to be his last controversial move. Fighting Sioux controversy \\"Tradition is the gentle fabric woven through time and experience which generates meaning, character, and identity to one and all.

Midway in its construction, Engelstad threatened to withdraw funding if the long-standing nickname were to be changed.Letter from Engelstad to UND President Charles Kupchella The logo was placed in thousands of instances in the arena, making the prospect of removal a costly measure. Later, Engelstad placed the stadium under private (rather than University) management and stipulated that the Fighting Sioux motif be kept indefinitely. An Engelstad family trust continues to own the arena and rents it to the University. The North Dakota Board of Higher Education ruled on April 8, 2010, to retire the Fighting Sioux nickname in response to pressure from the NCAA. On February 8, 2012 the \\"repeal of the repeal\\" took place. After 17,213 North Dakota residents signed a petition bringing the debate over the nickname to a statewide vote, UND resumed use of the nickname.

Its unique design consists of two lenticular iron trusses above the water, with conventional plate-girder approach spans. This gives it a total length of . It carries the Cornish Main Line railway in and out of Cornwall. It is adjacent to the Tamar Bridge which opened in 1962 to carry the A38 road. The Royal Albert Bridge was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Surveying started in 1848 and construction commenced in 1854. The first main span was positioned in 1857 and the completed bridge was opened by Prince Albert on 2 May 1859. Brunel died later that year and his name was then placed above the portals at either end of the bridge as a memorial. Work was carried out during the twentieth century to replace the approach spans and strengthen the main spans. It has attracted sightseers since its construction and has appeared in many paintings, photographs, guidebooks, postage stamps and on the UK ¬£2 coin. Anniversary celebrations took place in 1959 and 2009. Cornwall Railway Two rival schemes for a railway to Falmouth, Cornwall, were proposed in the 1830s. The 'central' scheme was a route from Exeter around the north of Dartmoor, an easy route to construct but with little intermediate traffic. The other, the 'coastal' scheme, was a line with many engineering difficulties but which could serve the important naval town of Devonport and the industrial area around St Austell. The central scheme was backed by the London and South Western Railway while the coastal scheme was promoted by the Cornwall Railway and backed by the Great Western Railway which wanted it to join up with the South Devon Railway at Devonport. The Cornwall Railway applied for an Act of Parliament in 1845 but it was rejected, in part because of William Moorsom's plan to carry trains across the water of the Hamoaze on the Devonport-to- Torpoint Ferry. Following this Isambard Kingdom Brunel took over as engineer and proposed to cross the water higher upstream using a bridge at Saltash instead. The Act enabling this scheme was passed on 3 August 1846. Design A drawing of one span and its piers The structure was the third in a series of three large wrought iron bridges built in the middle of the nineteenth century and was influenced by the preceding two, both of which had been designed by Robert Stephenson. The two central sections of Brunel's bridge are novel adaptations of the design Stephenson employed for the High Level Bridge across the River Tyne in Newcastle Upon Tyne in 1849. Brunel was present when Stephenson raised the girders of his Britannia Bridge across the Menai Strait in the same year. From 1849 to 1853 Brunel was erecting an iron bridge of his own; the Chepstow Railway Bridge carried the South Wales Railway across the River Wye and featured a main truss of with a curving tubular main member and three conventional plate-girder approach spans of , a similar solution to that adopted for crossing the River Tamar at Saltash. The river is about wide at Saltash. Brunel's first thoughts had been to cross this on a double track timber viaduct with a central span of and six approach spans of with clearance above the water. This was rejected by the Admiralty, who had statutory responsibility for navigable waters, so Brunel produced a revised design to give clearance, with two spans of and two of . The Admiralty again rejected this plan, stipulating that there should not be more than one pier in the navigable part of the river. Brunel now abandoned plans for a double track timber structure and instead proposed a single track wrought iron design consisting of a single span. As the cost of this structure would have been around ¬£500,000 at 1846 prices (equivalent to ¬£ in ), he amended the design to one of two main spans of with clearance above mean high spring tide; this was approved by the Admiralty and the directors of the Cornwall Railway. The two spans are lenticular trusses with the top chord of each truss comprising a heavy tubular arch in compression, while the bottom chord comprises a pair of chains. Each of the trusses is simply supported and therefore no horizontal thrust is exerted on the piers, which is crucial in view of the curved track on either side. Between these two chords are supporting cross-bracing members and suspension standards which hang beneath the bottom chord to carry the railway deck which is a continuous plate beam. There are also seventeen much shorter and more conventional plate-girder approach spans on the shore. On the Cornish side there are ten which measure (from Saltash station towards the river): , , , , , , , , , , and seven on the Devon side of (from the river towards St Budeaux): , , , , , , . This gives a total length for the nineteen spans of . History =Construction= A tide recorder designed by Brunel as part of his survey The first work was to properly survey the river bed. On 26 April 1848 a iron cylinder tall was launched into the Tamar. From the bottom of this the bed of the river could be examined to identify its nature and the location of solid foundations. The Cornwall Railway at this time was finding it difficult to raise funds and so most operations were suspended that summer, but a small fund was allowed for Brunel to continue the survey. The cylinder was positioned at 35 different places and a total of 175 borings made. In 1853 the tenders for the bridge were considered by the Cornwall Railway Board, and it was decided to let the work to Charles John Mare, a shipbuilder from Blackwall who had built the ironwork for the Britannia Bridge. The fee he sought for building the Saltash Bridge was ¬£162,000, but on 21 September 1855 while constructing the first of the two trusses he filed for bankruptcy. Brunel proposed that the company should complete this first truss itself by its own direct labour, to which the company agreed. A contract for the remainder of the building was awarded to Messrs Hudson and Male. The first span and centre pier under construction in 1854, seen from Saltash Mare's first task had been to establish an erecting yard on the Devon shore with a jetty and workshops. He then proceeded to construct a iron cylinder tall which was to form the work base for the construction of the central pier. This was launched in May 1854 and moored in the centre of the river between four pontoons. The bottom had been shaped to follow the rock surveyed in 1848; once it was settled on the river bed the water was pumped out, the mud within it excavated, and a solid masonry pier built up clear of the water. This was completed in November 1856. The landward piers on the Cornish side of the river were completed in 1854 and the girders for these spans were hoisted up to their correct positions. Next to be built was the main truss for the Cornwall side of the river. The lower ties of the trusses formed of chains made from links. Many were obtained from the suspended works for Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge and others rolled new for Saltash. The Cornwall span was floated into position on 1 September 1857 and jacked up to full height in stages as the piers were built up beneath it, the central pier using cast iron octagonal columns; the landward one using ordinary masonry. The second span soon after it was floated onto the piers and had been jacked up the first towards its final position With the yard now cleared of the first truss, work could start on the main Devon span. This was similarly floated into position on 10 July 1858 and then raised in a similar manner; it was in its final position by 28 December 1858. After this had been removed, part of the yard had to be cleared to allow the construction of the final landward pier and then the Devon approach spans could be raised up to their final position. The work was sufficiently advanced that directors were able to make an inspection by train on 11 April 1859. The Cornwall span had been tested before it was launched. The two ends were supported on substantial timber piers and the remaining scaffolding removed. Static loads of were placed on the deck, the deflections measured and any permanent change measured once the road was removed. Now that it was completed, the bridge had its statutory inspection and tests by Colonel Yolland on behalf of the Board of Trade on 20 April 1859. He ran a heavy train over the bridge and measured deflections in the main trusses of in the Devon truss, and in the Cornwall one. Overall he described it as 'highly satisfactory'. =Opening day= Prince Albert had agreed to the bridge being named after him as early as 1853. He was also invited to perform the opening ceremony, and on 2 May 1859 he travelled from Windsor on the Royal Train. Several thousand spectators attended that day, although guests from Cornwall were late for the ceremony as their train broke down at Liskeard. Illness prevented the attendance of Brunel who was instead represented by his chief assistant Robert Brereton. Public services commenced on 4 May 1859. =Changes since 1859= After Brunel's premature death on 15 September 1859 the directors of the Cornwall Railway Company decided to make the bridge a memorial to him by adding the words I.K. BRUNEL, ENGINEER, 1859 in large metal letters on either end of the bridge. In 1921, new access platforms were added that obscured the lettering but in 2006 Network Rail relocated the platforms, allowing the name to be clearly seen again. The walkways had previously been temporarily removed in 1959 and the bridge floodlit during its centenary year. Over the weekend of 21‚Äì22 May 1892 the track gauge on the bridge was converted from to during the final conversion of the whole Great Western Railway. 401 new cross-girders were fitted in 1905 to allow heavier locomotives to pass over. In 1908 the two spans nearest Saltash station were replaced with wider ones to accommodate a new track layout. The remaining approach spans were replaced on both sides of the river during 1928 and 1929. During the 1930s new cross-bracing and diagonal sway-bracing were added between the vertical standards to further strengthen the bridge and keep the suspension chains hanging in the correct shape. The refurbished bridge from Saltash Quay The bridge was Grade 1 listed in 1952. Additional links between the suspensions chains and the decking were added in 1969 to further strengthen the bridge. In 2011 Network Rail began a three-year ¬£10 million refurbishment involving replacing 50,000 bolts and installation of 100 tonnes of new steelwork. The bridge has also been stripped back to the bare metal and repainted in the Goose Grey colour originally applied in 1952. Viewing the bridge Looking out from the view point by the Tamar Bridge office on the Devon bank The bridge can be crossed using a train on the Cornish Main Line which affords far-reaching views of the Tamar. Cruise boats operate between Phoenix Wharf, Plymouth, from Saltash, and Calstock. Main view points are: *Saltash railway station () :The Cornish approach spans start right at the platform end. These were replaced in 1908 so that the single line on the bridge could split into two lines before reaching the station. *Saltash Quay () :The foreshore at Saltash runs right up to the pier that supports the Cornish end of the main span. An inscribed stone commemorating the bridge can be found beneath the bridge on the hillside alongside Fore Street. *Tamar Bridge () :The road bridge runs parallel to and slightly higher, on the north side. A toll-free foot and cycle path is on the south side of the road bridge from which it is possible to examine the bridge in detail. An area of grass beside the motor vehicle toll booths affords a view of the Devon end of the railway bridge. *Saltash Passage, St Budeaux () :The Devon piers can be reached from the waterfront at St Budeaux. The yard where the spans were constructed was situated alongside the bridge at the foot of the road down the hill. Panorama of the Royal Albert Bridge and the Tamar Bridge Cultural impact Bench seat at the Brunel Museum, Rotherhithe, London incorporating a model of the bridge with a train The construction of such a large and distinctive bridge soon caught the attention of the general public. The launching of the Cornish span in 1857 attracted a crowd of around 20,000, with similar numbers said to have witnessed the launch of the Devonport span and the opening day. During its construction it was photographed many times and after its opening it was the subject for many paintings, including those by Devonport-born artist Alfred Wallis. It has also been the subject of many photographs and postcards. It was already a feature in guidebooks in the year of its opening: It is a labour of Hercules, but Mr Brunel has accomplished the feat proclaimed one, and went on to report in detail the design and construction of the bridge that for novelty and ingenuity of construction stands unrivalled in the world. More than 100 years later it continues to appear in many travel guides and features. John Betjeman summed up its impact on the traveller: > The general grey slate and back gardens of Plymouth, as seen from the Great > Western made the surprise of Saltash Bridge all the more exciting. Up and > down stream, grey battleships were moored in the Tamar and its reaches. > Hundreds of feet below, the pathetic steam ferry to Saltash from the Devon > bank tried to compete with Brunel's mighty bridge. The bridge has become a symbol of the transition from Devon to Cornwall. In the Great Western Railway's The Cornish Riviera travel guide, SPB Mais regarded it as \\"an almost magic means of transporting travellers from a county, which, if richer than others, is yet unmistakingly an English county, to a Duchy which is in every respect un-English. You shut your eyes going over the Saltash Bridge only to open them again on a foreign scene\\". However, Cornish people look at it in the other way; in the song \\"Cousin Jack\\", English folk duo Show of Hands sing \\"I dream of a bridge on the Tamar, It opens us up to the East\\". The bridge is the backdrop of ITV1's The West Country Tonight during the old westcountry region. =Special events= A new commemorative plaque was unveiled at Saltash station on 4 May 2009 to recognise the 150th anniversary of the bridge. Special occasions have been marked over the years by special events: *1859 ‚Äì The bridge was opened by Prince Albert two days before the railway was opened to the public. He arrived by special train from Windsor, was shown around the bridge and the works yard, and then left aboard the Royal Yacht. *1959 ‚Äì Floodlights lit up the bridge during 1959 in celebration of its centenary. *2006 ‚Äì The anniversary of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's 200th birthday was celebrated by Network Rail permanently removing the access ways that covered his name above the portals. *2009 ‚Äì During the bank holiday weekend of 2‚Äì4 May there were many special events to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the opening of the bridge including a guided walk across the bridge and a re-enactment of the opening day.

Fulbright is the longest serving chairman in the history of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. A Southern Democrat and a staunch multilateralist, he supported the creation of the United Nations and was a signatory to the Southern Manifesto. Fulbright also opposed McCarthyism and the House Un-American Activities Committee and later became known for his opposition to American involvement in the Vietnam War. His efforts to establish an international exchange program eventually resulted in the creation of a fellowship program which bears his name, the Fulbright Program.  Early life  An earlier portrait of Senator Fulbright. Fulbright was born in Sumner, Missouri, the son of Roberta Fulbright (n√©e Waugh) and Jay Fulbright. In 1906 the Fulbright family moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas. His mother was a businesswoman, who consolidated her husband's business enterprises and became an influential newspaper publisher, editor, and journalist. Fulbright's parents enrolled him in the University of Arkansas's College of Education's experimental grammar and secondary school. Fulbright earned a history degree from the University of Arkansas in 1925, where he became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. He was elected president of the student body and a star four-year player for the Razorback football team from 1921 to 1924. Fulbright later studied at Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes Scholar at Pembroke College and graduated in 1928. Fulbright's time at Oxford made him into a lifelong Anglophile, and he always had warm memories of Oxford.Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.3 Fulbright credited his time at Oxford with broadening his horizons as he learned much about the world beyond America and particulay credited one of his professors and friends, R. B. McCallum, with encouraging him to think about the world as an interlinked entity, where developments in one part of the world would always impact on the other parts.Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.3 McCallum was a great admirer of Woodrow Wilson, a supporter of the League of Nations, and a believer that multinational organizations were the best way to keep the peace.Woods, Randall J. William Fulbright, Vietnam, and the Search for a Cold War Foreign Policy, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998 p.3 Fulbright remained close to McCallum for the rest of his life and regularly exchanged letters with his mentor until his death in 1973.Woods, Randall J. William Fulbright, Vietnam, and the Search for a Cold War Foreign Policy, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998 p.3 At Oxford, he played on the rugby and lacrosse teams, and every summer, Fulbright decamped for France ostensibly to improve his French but really just to enjoy life in France.Woods, Randall J. William Fulbright, Vietnam, and the Search for a Cold War Foreign Policy, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998 p.3 Fulbright's \\"one world\\" philosophy encouraged by McCallum made him skeptical of isolationism. He received his law degree from The George Washington University Law School in 1934, was admitted to the bar in Washington, DC, and became an attorney in the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. Fulbright was a lecturer in law at the University of Arkansas from 1936 to 1939. He was appointed president of the school in 1939, making him the youngest university president in the country. He held that post until 1941. The School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Arkansas is named in his honor, and he was elected there into Phi Beta Kappa. He was a member of the Founding Council of the Rothermere American Institute, University of Oxford. In September 1939, Fulbright, as president of the University of Arkansas, issued a public declaration declaring his sympathy with the Allied cause and urged the United States to maintain a pro-Allied neutrality.Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.3 In the summer of 1940, Fulbright went a step further and declared it was in America's \\"vital interest\\" to enter the war on the Allied side and warned that a victory by Nazi Germany would make the world a much darker.Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.3 The same year, Fulbright joined the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies.Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.3 Fulbright's sister, Roberta, married Gilbert C. Swanson, the head of the Swanson frozen-foods conglomerate, and was the maternal grandmother of media figure Tucker Carlson. In June 1941, Fulbright was suddenly fired from the University of Arkansas by the Governor, Homer Martin Adkins.Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.3 He learned that the reason for his sacking was that Adkins had been offended that a newspaper owned by Fulbright's mother had supported the governor's opponent in the 1940 Democratic primary, and that was the governor's revenge.Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.3 Upset at the way that the governor's caprice had ended his academic career, Fulbright became interested in politics.Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.3  Congressional career  =U.S. House of Representatives= Fulbright was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1942, where he served one term. During this period, he became a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. During World War II, there was much debate about the best way to win the peace after the Allies presumably won the war, with many urging the United States to reject isolationism. The House adopted the Fulbright Resolution, which supported international peacekeeping initiatives and encouraged the United States to participate in what became the United Nations in September 1943. That brought Fulbright to national attention. In 1943, a confidential analysis by Isaiah Berlin of the House and Senate foreign relations committees for the British Foreign Office identified Fulbright as \\"a distinguished new-comer to the House.\\" It continued: =U.S. Senate= He was elected to the Senate in 1944 and unseated incumbent Hattie Carraway, the first woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate. He served five six-year terms. In his first general election to the Senate, Fulbright defeated the Republican Victor Wade of Batesville by 85.1% to 14.9%. He promoted the passage of legislation establishing the Fulbright Program in 1946 of educational grants (Fulbright Fellowships and Fulbright Scholarships), sponsored by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the United States Department of State, governments in other countries, and the private sector. The program was established to increase mutual understanding between the peoples of the United States and other countries through the exchange of persons, knowledge, and skills.On Fulbright's goal of promoting peace and the influence of the Rhodes Scholarships, seeDonald Markwell, (2013). \\"Instincts to Lead\\": on Leadership, Peace, and Education, Connor Court: Australia. It is considered one of the most prestigious award programs and operates in 155 countries. In 1947, he supported the Truman Doctrine and voted for American aid to Greece.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5 Subsequently, he voted for the Marshall Plan and to join NATO.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5 Fulbright was very supportive of the plans for a federation of Western Europe.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5 Fulbright supported the 1950 plan written by Jean Monnet and presented by French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman for a European Coal and Steel Community, which came into existence in 1951 and became the European Economic Community in 1957 and was renamed the European Union in 1993. Fulbright became a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1949 and served as chairman from 1959 to 1974. He was the longest-serving chair in that committee's history. In his speeches, Fulbright showed himself to be a Europeanist committed to resisting Soviet expansionism in Europe but was hostile to American commitments in Asia.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5 Despite his reputation as one of the Senate's leading foreign policy experts, he said almost nothing about the Korean War until China entered the war in October 1950. He then warned against escalating the war by attacking China, despite the support from many both outside and inside the government, most notably General Douglas MacArthur.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5 In a speech on 18 January 1951, he dismissed Korea as a matter of peripheral interest that was not worth World War III, and he condemned the plans to attack China as reckless and dangerous.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5 In the same speech, he argued that the Soviet Union, not China, was the real enemy and that Korea was a distraction from Europe, which he considered to be far more important.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5 When President Harry S. Truman sacked MacArthur for insubordination in April 1951 after MacArthur publicly criticized Truman for deciding to not widen the war and stating that the United States would not directly attack China, Fulbright came to Truman's defense.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5 Against MacArthur's argument that there was \\"no substitute for victory\\" and the Korean War could not be won except expanding it by attacking China, Fulbright noted that the U.S. Constitution states quite explicitly that the President is the supreme commander-in-chief and that it was the duty of generals to obey the president, not vice versa.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5 When MacArthur appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, having been invited by Republican senators looking for a chance to embarrass Truman, Fulbright embraced the role of Truman's defender.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5 During his acrimonious exchanges with MacArthur, a basic difference emerged in their philosophies. MacArthur took a position that was strongly anticommunist and argued that communism, by its very existence, was a mortal danger to the United States, which required a policy of seeking to eradicate communism whatever it existed in the world. From that viewpoint, MacArthur argued that Truman's policy of fighting a \\"limited war\\" in Korea was dangerous and that the correct policy to follow was to invade China with the aim of overthrowing Mao Zedong and restoring Chiang Kai-shek.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5 In response, Fulbright stated, \\"I had not myself thought of our enemy as being Communism, I thought of it as primarily being imperialist Russia.\\"Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5 Fulbright believed that the antagonist was the Soviet Union, or Russia, as he preferred to call it, which just happened to be a communist state and so he advocated a foreign policy he advocated that was anti-Soviet, rather than anticommunist.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.5-6 At the same time, Fulbright believed that World War III would be almost certainly be a nuclear war that might very well spell the end of humanity and so he favored the policy of containment of the Soviet Union, instead of the policy of rollback advocated by MacArthur and many right-wing American politicians such as Senator Joseph McCarthy.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.6 Furthermore, Fulbright saw the Cold War as more of a political struggle than a military struggle, and in a 1952 speech, he criticized Truman for excessively-high levels of military spending.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.6 Fulbright argued that the evidence that the Soviet Union was about to attack the United States was weak. If a war with the Soviets was extremely unlikely to occur, he asked if it was really necessary to devote such a high percentage of the budget to the military.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.6 The intellectual Fulbright had a strong personal dislike of the anti-intellectual McCarthy, whose demagogy Fulbright viewed as a major threat to American democracy and likely to cause World War III.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.6 In a speech, Fulbright called McCarthy a vulgar and crude man, who, if unchecked, would cause America's institutions to fall victim to \\"swinish blight of anti-intellectualism\\".Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.6 Fulbright was the only senator to vote against an appropriation for the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in 1954, which was chaired by McCarthy. Like his friend, Adlai Stevenson, Fulbright was regarded as a \\"Cold War liberal.\\"Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.7 During the Eisenhower administration, Fulbright tended to support the substance of its policies, but he criticized its style.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.7 In 1956, Fulbright campaigned across the country for the unsuccessful Stevenson-Kefauver ticket. He swamped his Republican challenger that year, Ben C. Henley, the state party chairman and a brother of U.S. District Judge Jesse Smith Henley of Harrison, Arkansas. In his re-election bid in 1956, Fulbright emphasized his opposition to civil rights for black people and his support for segregation. He also noted his support for oil companies and consistent votes for more farm aid to poultry farmers (one of Arkansas's major exports were chickens).Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.6-7 Fulbright signed the Southern Manifesto in opposition of the U.S. Supreme Court's historic 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, which the Manifesto deemed \\"a clear abuse of judicial power.\\" With other southern Democrats, Fulbright participated in the filibuster of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and opposed the 1965 Voting Rights Act.Woods 1995, pp. 330-331. However, in 1970, during the Nixon administration, Fulbright voted for a five-year extension of the Voting Rights Act.Woods 1995, p. 555. He also led the charge against confirming Nixon's conservative Supreme Court nominees Clement Haynsworth and Harold Carswell.Woods 1995, pp. 555-557. According to a historian and former Special Assistant to President John F. Kennedy Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., Fulbright was Kennedy's first choice as Secretary of State, but it was felt that Fulbright was too controversial. Rather the \\"lowest common denominator\\", Dean Rusk, was chosen. Senator Fulbright and the Chicken Tax US intensive chicken farming led to the 1961‚Äì1964 \\"chicken war\\" with Europe. With imports of inexpensive chicken from the U.S., chicken prices fell quickly and sharply across Europe, which radically affected European chicken consumption. U.S. chicken overtook nearly half of the imported European chicken market. Coming on the heels of a \\"crisis in trade relations between the U.S. and the Common Market,\\" Europe moved ahead with tariffs. Senator Fulbright, as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Democratic Senator from Arkansas‚Äîa chief poultry-producing state‚Äîinterrupted a NATO debate on nuclear armament to protest trade sanctions on U.S. chicken, going so far as to threaten cutting US troops in NATO. The U.S. subsequently enacted a 25% tariff on imported light trucks, known as the chicken tax, which remains in effect as of 2010. Fulbright raised serious objections to Kennedy about the impending Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961 and also to President Lyndon B. Johnson on the 1965 Dominican Civil War. In May 1961, Fulbright denounced the Kennedy administration's system of having diplomats rotate from one position to another as an \\"idiot policy.\\" On 30 July 1961, two weeks before the erection of the Berlin Wall, Fulbright said in a television interview, \\"I don't understand why the East Germans don't just close their border, because I think they have the right to close it.\\"Congressional Record ‚Äî Senate, August 1, 1961, pp. 14222-14224. Fulbright's statement was reported as a three-column spread on the front page of the East German communist Socialist Unity Party of Germany newspaper Neues Deutschland. The West German reception of his statement was extremely negative. A cable from US embassy in Bonn reported that \\"rarely has a statement by a prominent American official aroused so much consternation, chagrin and anger.\\" Chancellor Willy Brandt's Press Secretary Egon Bahr was quoted as saying, \\"We privately called him Fulbricht.\\"Berlin in Early Berlin- Wall Era CIA, State Department, and Army Booklets, T.H.E. Hill (compiler), 2014, pp. xviii, xix, 279, 283. (Walter Ulbricht, who was the East German head of state at the time.) McGeorge Bundy sent the press coverage of Fulbright's interview to Kennedy with a comment about \\"the helpful impact of Senator Fulbright's remarks.\\" Kennedy subsequently refused to distance himself from Fulbright's observation, which suggests that he asked Fulbright to make the statement as a way of signaling to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev that the building of a wall would be viewed by the U.S. as an acceptable way of defusing the Berlin Crisis.W. R. Smyser, Kennedy and the Berlin Wall, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2009, p. 90. Fulbright met with Kennedy during the latter's visit to Fort Smith, Arkansas, in October 1961. After the Cuban Missile Crisis, which almost caused a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union, Fulbright moved away from the \\"containment\\" policies that he had advocated in the 1950s.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.10 Fulbright argued that a nuclear war would be the end of humanity and though he did not like the Soviet Union, it was far better to pursue a policy of d√©tente and of reducing tensions than to fight a war that nobody would win.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.10-11 Fulbright was regularly involved in debates with Senator Barry Goldwater, who had emerged as the leader of the more right-wing Republicans.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.11 In response to Goldwater's call for a \\"total victory\\" over communism, Fulbright challenged him by asking if he really believed that a \\"total victory\\" was worth a nuclear war that would kill hundreds of millions of people.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.11 When Goldwater replied it was possible for the U.S. to win a nuclear war, Fulbright challenged him if he really wanted the U.S. to occupy what would be left of the Soviet Union and China after a nuclear war, and Goldwater did not reply to the remark.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.11 During testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1963, Fulbright claimed that $5 million tax-deductible from philanthropic Americans was sent to Israel and then recycled back to the U.S. for distribution to organizations seeking to influence public opinion in favor of Israel.Grant F. Smith, , \\"Pulse Media\\", August 28, 2009 That statement led to friction with organized pro-Israeli groups in the U.S. Frustration with the ability of the Zionist Organization of America and other Zionist lobby groups to influence senators with their campaign contributions led Fulbright to retort on Face the Nation on April 15, 1973, \\"Israel controls the U.S. Senate.\\" \\"The Senate is subservient to Israel, in my opinion much too much. We should be more concerned about the United States interest rather than doing the bidding of Israel. This is a most unusual development.\\" Perhaps his most notable case of dissent was his public condemnation of foreign and domestic policies, in particular, his concern that right-wing radicalism, as espoused by the John Birch Society and the wealthy oilman H. L. Hunt, had infected the U.S. military. He was, in turn, denounced by Republican Senators J. Strom Thurmond and Barry Goldwater. Goldwater and Texas Senator John Tower announced that they were going to Arkansas to campaign against Fulbright,Johnson, Haynes and Gwertzmann, Bernard (1968). Fulbright: The Dissenter. Doubleday. but Arkansas voters re-elected Fulbright. One of Fulbright's local staffers in Arkansas was James McDougal. While he worked for Fulbright, McDougal met the future Arkansas Governor and US President Bill Clinton and the two of them, along with their wives, began investing in various development properties, including the parcel of land along the White River in the Ozarks that would later be the subject of an independent counsel investigation during Clinton's first term in office. Despite serving in the Senate for 30 years, Fulbright remained Arkansas' junior senator throughout his tenure, serving alongside the senior senator, John L. McClellan. He along with Tom Harkin of Iowa who served alongside Chuck Grassley, are both the longest-serving senators in history who never became their state's senior senator. In terms of legislative power, Fulbright's career was somewhat stunted, with its influence never matching its luminescence. For all his seniority and powerful committee posts, he was not considered part of the Senate's inner circle of friends and power brokers. He seemed to prefer it that way: the man who Harry S. Truman had called an \\"overeducated SOB\\" was, in the words of Clayton Fritchey, \\"an individualist and a thinker,\\" whose \\"intellectualism alone alienates him from the Club\\" of the Senate. = McCarthy confrontation = The Republicans gained a majority in the Senate after the 1952 elections, which allowed Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy to become chairman of the Senate Committee on Government Operations. A month into McCarthy's tenure, Fulbright received a letter from former Connecticut Senator William Benton with whom he had developed a friendship during the Jessup hearings. Benton had lost his re-election bid the previous November after being targeted by anticommunist supporters of McCarthy. Benton urged Fulbright to assume a leading role against McCarthy and pledged he would receive support for doing so. Fulbright, though sympathetic toward Benton, wished to follow the guideline set by Senate Minority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson, who indicated his unwillingness to have Democrats become involved in condemning McCarthy. Fulbright was alarmed by McCarthy's attack on the Voice of America (VOA) and the United States Information Agency, the latter agency then supervising educational exchange programs. That was followed by the summer 1953 withdrawal by the State Department of a fellowship for a male student, whose wife was suspected of communist affiliation and the scheduling by the Senate Appropriations Committee of a hearing on the annual appropriations of the Information Agency, the inquiry appearing to put the Fulbright Program at stake. The confrontation between Fulbright and McCarthy took place in the Supreme Court Chamber of Capitol Hill. McCarthy questioned Fulbright over his knowledge of whether the board clearing students for funding from the Information Agency received a security check, and on a policy that bars communists and their sympathizers from receiving appointments as lecturers and professors. McCarthy pressed Fulbright to answer the second question while Fulbright recounted members of the board. McCarthy explained that he believed that Fulbright had some level of influence on the Fulbright Program since it bore his name, but Fulbright disagreed and stated that his exerting such influence would destroy the board. After McCarthy insisted to be authorized to release statements of some Fulbright Program students both praising the communist form of government and condemning American values, Fulbright countered that he was willing to submit thousands of names of students who had praised the US and its way of government in their statements. The encounter was the last time McCarthy made a public assault on the program. The leading historian and original Fulbright Program board member Walter Johnson credited Fulbright with preventing the program from being ended by McCarthyism. = Early segregation activities = In 1950, Fulbright cosponsored an amendment, which, if enacted, would allow soldiers to choose whether or not to serve in a racially-integrated unit. Two years later, Fulbright assisted with blocking an Alaska statehood bill entirely because of his view that legislators from the state would support civil rights bills. To express southern disagreement with the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which ruled that public school segregation was unconstitutional,Joseph Crespino, \\"The Scarred Stone: The Strom Thurmond Monument\\", Southern Spaces, 29 April 2010, accessed 10 July 2012 South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond wrote the initial draft of the Southern Manifesto. Fulbright signed a later version of the document, along with 18 other senators. In a letter to a constituent in Little Rock, Fulbright stated that the South had no way of expressing how wrong its representatives believed the Supreme Court was except to attempt to replicate the secession of the South from the Union before the American Civil War. Fulbright telephoned Alabama Senators John Sparkman and Lister Hill as well as Price Daniel, all of whom agreed to support a moderate version of the Southern Manifesto. Fulbright told his despondent aides that the new version would be the only way that Hill and he would retain influence within the Dixie delegation. The draft put forth by the four senators took a moderate approach to the Supreme Court decision by pledging the southern senators would reverse the ruling through legal moves and recognizing themselves as the minority in the Senate. Hardliners against civil rights were dismayed by the modifications to the document made by Fulbright because they viewed it as casting them as supplicants, rather than victims. According to the biographer Randall Bennett Woods, Fulbright believed that the South was not yet ready for integration but that education would eventually eradicate prejudice and allow blacks to \\"take their rightful place in American society.\\" Fulbright's signing of the Southern Manifesto did not prevent him from being able to survive politically amid the growing numbers of black voters in Arkansas. He delivered an address to the Arkansas Democratic Voters' Association, where he insisted his intervention had led to the moderate version of the Southern Manifesto, and his claims were generally accepted by Arkansan black leadership. =Vietnam War and US. foreign policy= In early 1961, Fulbright advised Kennedy not to back the Bay of Pigs invasion: \\"The Castro regime is a thorn in the flesh. But it is not a dagger at the heart.\\"Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000 p.125 In August 1961, as the Kennedy administration held firm in its commitment to a five-year foreign aid program, Fulbright and Pennsylvania U.S. Representative Thomas E. Morgan accompanied Democratic congressional leadership to their weekly White House breakfast session with Kennedy. In delivering opening statements on August 4, Fulbright spoke of the program introducing a new concept of foreign aid in the event of its passage. On March 25, 1964, Fulbright delivered an address calling on the U.S. to adapt itself to a world that was both changing and complex, the address being said by Fulbright to have been meant to explore self-evident truths in the national vocabulary of the U.S. regarding the Soviet Union, Cuba, China, Panama, and Latin America. In May 1964, Fulbright predicated that time would see a cessation in the misunderstanding within the relationship between France and the United States and that French President Charles de Gaulle was deeply admired for his achievements despite confusion that might arise in others from his rhetoric. On 4 August 1964, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara accused North Vietnam of attacking an American destroyer, the USS Maddox in international waters in what came to be known as the Gulf of Tonkin incident.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.24 The same day, President Johnson went on national television to denounce North Vietnam for \\"aggression\\" and to announce that he had ordered retaliatory air raids on North Vietnam.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.24 In the same speech, Johnson asked Congress to a resolution to prove to North Vietnam and its ally China that United States was united \\"in support of freedom and in defense of peace in southeast Asia.\\"Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.24 On 5 August 1964, Fulbright arrived at the White House to meet Johnson, where Johnson asked his old friend to use all his influence to get the resolution passed by the widest possible margin.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.25 Fulbright was one of the senators whom Johnson was most anxious and keen to have support the resolution.Karnow, Stanley Vietnam A History, New York: Viking, 1983 p.374 Fulbright was too much an individualist and intellectual to belong to the \\"Club\\" of the Senate, but he was widely respected as a thinker on foreign policy and was known to be a defender of Congress's prerogatives. From Johnson's viewpoint, having him support the resolution would bring many of the waverers around to voting for the resolution, as indeed proved to be the case.Karnow, Stanley Vietnam A History, New York: Viking, 1983 p.376 Johnson insisted quite vehemently to Fulbright that the alleged attack on the Maddox had taken place, and it was only later that Fulbright became skeptical about whether the alleged attack had really taken place.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.25 Furthermore, Johnson insisted that the resolution, which was a \\"functional equivalent to a declaration of war,\\" was not intended to be used for going to war in Vietnam.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.25 In the 1964 presidential election, the Republicans had nominated Goldwater as their candidate, who ran on a platform accusing Johnson of being \\"soft on communism\\" and by contrast promised a \\"total victory\\" over communism. Johnson argued to Fulbright that the resolution was an election-year stunt that would prove to the voters that he was really \\"tough on communism\\" and so dent the appeal of Goldwater by denying him of his main avenue of attack.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.25 Besides for the internal political reason that Johnson gave for the resolution, he also gave a foreign policy reason that argued that such a resolution would intimidate North Vietnam into ceasing to try to overthrow the government of South Vietnam and so Congress passage of the resolution would make American involvement in Vietnam less likely, rather than more likely.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.25 Fulbright's longstanding friendship with Johnson made it difficult for him to go against him, who cunningly exploited Fulbright's vulnerability, his desire to have greater influence over foreign policy.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.25 Johnson gave Fulbright the impression that he would be one of his unofficial advisers on foreign policy and that he was very interested in turning his ideas into policies if he voted for the resolution, which was a test of their friendship.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.25 Johnson also hinted that he was thinking about sacking Rusk if he won the 1964 election and would consider nominating Fulbright to be the next Secretary of State.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.25 Finally, for Fulbright in 1964, it was inconceivable that Johnson would lie to him, and Fulbright believed the resolution \\"was not going to be used for anything other than the Tonkin Gulf incident itself,\\" as Johnson had told him.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.25 On 6 August 1964, Fulbright gave a speech on the Senate floor that called for the resolution to be passed as he accused North Vietnam of \\"aggression\\" and praised Johnson for his \\"great restraint... in response to the provocation of a small power.\\"Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.26 He also declared his support for the Johnson administration's \\"noble\\" Vietnam policy, which he called a policy of seeking \\"to establish viable, independent states in Indochina and elsewhere which will be free and secure from the combination of Communist China and Communist North Vietnam.\\"Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.26 Fulbright concluded that the policy could be accomplished via diplomatic means and, echoing Johnson's argument, argued that it was necessary to pass the resolution as a way to intimidate North Vietnam, which would presumably change its policies towards South Vietnam once Congress passed the resolution.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.26 Several senators, such as Allen Elleder, Jacob Javits, John Sherman Cooper, Daniel Brewster, George McGovern, and Gaylord Nelson, were very reluctant to vote for a resolution that would be a blank check for a war in Southeast Asia, and in a meeting, Fulbright sought to assure them by saying that passing such a resolution would make fighting a war less likely and claimed that the whole purpose of the resolution was intimidation.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.26 Nelson wanted to insert an amendment to bar the president from sending troops to fight in Vietnam unless he obtained the permission of Congress first and said that he did not like the open-ended nature of this resolution.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.27 Fulbright persuaded him not to do so by arguing the resolution was \\"harmless\\" and saying that the real purpose of the resolution was \\"to pull the rug out from under Goldwater.\\" He went on to ask Nelson whether he preferred Johnson or Goldwater to win the election.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.27 Fulbright dismissed Nelson's fears of giving Johnson a blank check by saying that he had Johnson's word that \\"the last thing we want to do is become involved in a land war in Asia.\\"Karnow, Stanley Vietnam A History, New York: Viking, 1983 p.376 On August 7, 1964, a unanimous House of Representatives and all but two members of the Senate voted to approve the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which led to a dramatic escalation of the Vietnam War. Fulbright, who sponsored the resolution, would later write: > Many Senators who accepted the Gulf of Tonkin resolution without question > might well not have done so had they foreseen that it would subsequently be > interpreted as a sweeping Congressional endorsement for the conduct of a > large-scale war in Asia. Fulbright (left) with Senator left By his own admission, Fulbright knew almost nothing about Vietnam until he met in 1965 Bernard B. Fall, a French journalist who often wrote about Vietnam.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.51 Speaking to Fall radically changed Fulbright's thinking about Vietnam, as Fall asserted that it simply not true that Ho Chi Minh was a Sino-Soviet \\"puppet\\" who wanted to overthrow the government of South Vietnam because his masters in Moscow and Beijing had presumably told him to do so.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.51 Fall's influence served as the catalyst for the change in Fulbright's thinking, as Fall introduced to the writings of Philippe Devillers and Jean Lacouture.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.51 Fulbright made it his mission to learn as possible about Vietnam and indeed he had learned so much that at a meeting with the Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Fulbright was able to correct several mistakes made by the former about Vietnamese history, much to Rusk's discomfort.Berman, William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.51 In January 1966, Fulbright invited Johnson to appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to explain why America was fighting in Vietnam, an offer that Johnson refused.Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000 p.417 As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Fulbright held several series of hearings on the Vietnam War. Many of the earlier hearings, in 1966, were televised to the nation in their entirety, a rarity until C-SPAN. Starting on 4 February 1966, Fulbright held the first hearings about the Vietnam War, where George F. Kennan and General James M. Gavin appeared as expert witnesses.Karnow, Stanley Vietnam A History, New York: Viking, 1983 p.486 The hearings had prompted by Johnson's request for additional $400 million to pay for the war, which gave Fulbright an excuse to hold them.Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000 p.419 Kennan testified that the Vietnam War was a grotesque distortion of the containment policy that he had outlined in 1946 and 1947. The World War II hero Gavin testified that it was his opinion as a soldier that the war could not be won as it being fought.Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000 p.419 On 4 February 1966, in an attempt to upstage the hearings Fulbright was holding in Washington, Johnson called an impromptu summit in Honolulu in the hope that the media would play more attention to the summit that he had called than to the hearings Fulbright was holding.Karnow, Stanley Vietnam A History, New York: Viking, 1983 p.486 Johnson's two rebuttal witnesses at the hearings were General Maxwell Taylor and Secretary of State Dean Rusk.Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000 p.419 Fulbright's reputation as a well-informed expert on foreign policy and his folksy Southern drawl, which made him sound \\"authentic\\" to ordinary Americans, made a formidable opponent for Johnson.Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000 p.420 During his exchanges with Taylor, Fulbright equated the firebombing of Japanese cities in World War II with the Operation Rolling Thunder bombings of North Vietnam and the use of napalm in South Vietnam, much to Taylor's discomfort.Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000 p.420 Fulbright condemned the bombing of North Vietnam and asked Taylor to think of the \\"millions of little children, sweet little children, innocent pure babies who love their mothers, and mothers who love their children, just lke you love your son, thousands of little children, who never did us any harm, being slowly burned to death.\\"Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000 p.420 A visibly-uncomfortable Taylor stated that the United States was not targeting civilians in either Vietnam.Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000 p.420 Johnson called the hearings \\"a very, very disastrous break.\\"Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000 p.420 As Fulbright had once been Johnson's friend, his criticism of the war was seen as a personal betrayal and lef Johnson to lash out in especially vitriolic terms against him.Karnow, Stanley Vietnam A History, New York: Viking, 1983 p.486 Johnson took the view that at least Senator Wayne Morse had always been opposed to the Vietnam War, but Fulbright had promised him to support his Vietnam policy in 1964, causing him to see Fulbright as a \\"Judas\\" figure.Karnow, Stanley Vietnam A History, New York: Viking, 1983 p.486 Johnson liked to mock Fulbright as \\"Senator Halfbright\\" and sneered it was astonishing that someone as \\"stupid\\" as Fulbright had been awarded a degree at Oxford.Karnow, Stanley Vietnam A History, New York: Viking, 1983 p.486 In April 1966, Fulbright delivered a speech at Johns Hopkins University, where Johnson had delivered a forthright defense of the war just a year earlier. Fulbright was sharply critical of the war.Karnow, Stanley Vietnam A History, New York: Viking, 1983 p.486 In his speech delivered in his usual folksy Southern drawl, Fulbright stated that the United States was \\"in danger of losing its perspective on what exactly is within the realm of its power and what is beyond it.\\"Karnow, Stanley Vietnam A History, New York: Viking, 1983 p.486 Warning of what he called \\"the arrogance of power,\\" Fulbright declared \\"we are not living up to our capacity and promise as a civilized power for the world.\\" He called the war a betrayal of American values.Karnow, Stanley Vietnam A History, New York: Viking, 1983 p.486 Johnson was furious with the speech, which he saw a personal attack from a man who had once been his friend and believed the remark about the \\"arrogance of power\\" to be about him.Karnow, Stanley Vietnam A History, New York: Viking, 1983 p.486 Johnson lashed out in a speech in which he called Fulbright and other critics of the war \\"nervous Nellies,\\" who knew the war in Vietnam could and would be won but were just too cowardly to fight on to the final victory.Karnow, Stanley Vietnam A History, New York: Viking, 1983 p.486 In 1966, Fulbright published The Arrogance of Power, which attacked the justification of the Vietnam War, Congress's failure to set limits on it, and the impulses that had given rise to it. Fulbright's scathing critique undermined the elite consensus that the military intervention in Indochina was necessitated by Cold War geopolitics. In his book, Fulbright offered an analysis of American foreign policy: > Throughout our history two strands have coexisted uneasily; a dominant > strand of democratic humanism and a lesser but durable strand of intolerant > Puritanism. There has been a tendency through the years for reason and > moderation to prevail as long as things are going tolerably well or as long > as our problems seem clear and finite and manageable. But... when some event > or leader of opinion has aroused the people to a state of high emotion, our > puritan spirit has tended to break through, leading us to look at the world > through the distorting prism of a harsh and angry moralism. Fulbright also related his opposition to any American tendencies to intervene in the affairs of other nations: > Power tends to confuse itself with virtue and a great nation is particularly > susceptible to the idea that its power is a sign of God's favor, conferring > upon it a special responsibility for other nations‚Äîto make them richer and > happier and wiser, to remake them, that is, in its own shining image. Power > confuses itself with virtue and tends also to take itself for omnipotence. > Once imbued with the idea of a mission, a great nation easily assumes that > it has the means as well as the duty to do God's work. He was also a strong believer in international law: > Law is the essential foundation of stability and order both within societies > and in international relations. As a conservative power, the United States > has a vital interest in upholding and expanding the reign of law in > international relations. Insofar as international law is observed, it > provides us with stability and order and with a means of predicting the > behavior of those with whom we have reciprocal legal obligations. When we > violate the law ourselves, whatever short-term advantage may be gained, we > are obviously encouraging others to violate the law; we thus encourage > disorder and instability and thereby do incalculable damage to our own long- > term interests. By 1967, the Senate was divided into three blocs. There was an antiwar \\"dove\\" bloc, led by Fulbright; a pro-war \\"hawk\\" bloc, led by the conservative Southern Democrat Senator John C. Stennis, and a third bloc consisting of waverers, who tended to shift their positions about war in tune with public opinion and moved variously closer to doves and hawks as they followed the public opinion polls.Karnow, Stanley Vietnam A History, New York: Viking, 1983 p.503 In contrast to his hostile attitudes towards Fulbright, Johnson was afraid of being labeled as soft on communism and so tended to try to appease Stennis and the hawks, who kept pressuring for more-and-more aggressive measures in Vietnam.Karnow, Stanley Vietnam A History, New York: Viking, 1983 p.503 In criticizing the war, Fulbright was careful to draw a distinction between condemning the war and condemning the ordinary soldiers fighting the war. After General William Westmoreland gave a speech in 1967 before a joint session of Congress, Fulbright stated, \\"From the military standpoint, it was fine. The point is the policy that put our boys there.\\"Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000 p.443 On 25 July 1967, Fulbright was invited with all of the other chairmen of the Senate committees to the White House to hear Johnson say that the war was being won.Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000 p.449 Fulbright told Johnson: \\"Mr. President, what you really need to do is stop the war. That will solve all your problems. Vietnam is ruining our domestic and our foreign policy. I will not support it anymore.\\"Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000 p.449 To prove that he was serious, Fulbright threatened to block a foreign aid bill before his committee and said that it was the only way to make Johnson pay attention to his concerns.Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000 p.449-450 Johnson accused Fulbright of wanting to ruin America's reputation around the world.Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000 p. 450 Using his favorite tactic of seeking to divide his opponents, Johnson told the other senators: \\"I understand all of you feel you under the gun when you are down here, at least according to Bill Fulbright.\\"Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000 p.450 Fulbright replied: \\"Well, my position is that Vietnam is central to the whole problem. We need a new look. The effects of Vietnam are hurting the budget and foreign relations generally.\\"Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000 p.450 Johnson exploded in fury: \\"Bill, everybody doesn't have a blind spot like you do. You say, 'Don't bomb North Vietnam', on just about everything. I don't have simple solution you have.... I am not going to tell our men in the field to put their right hands behind their backs and fight only with their lefts. If you want me to get out of Vietnam, then you have the prerogative of taking the resolution which we are out there now. You can repeal it tomorrow. You can tell the troops to come home. You can tell General Westmoreland that he doesn't know what is doing.\\"Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000 p.450 As Johnson's face was red, Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield decided to calm matters down by changing the subject.Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000 p. 450 In early 1968, Fulbright was deeply depressed as he stated: \\"The President, unfortunately, seems to have closed his mind to the consideration of any alternative, and his Rasputin-W.W. Rostow-seems able to isolate him from other views, and the Secretary [of State] happens to agree. I regret that I am unable to break this crust of immunity.\\"Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.93 However, after Robert McNamara was fired as Defense Secretary, Fulbright saw a \\"ray of light\\" as the man who replaced McNamara, Clark Clifford, was a longstanding \\"close personal friend.\\"Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.93 Johnson had appointed Clifford Defense Secretary because he was a hawk, but Fulbright sought to change his mind about Vietnam.Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.93 Fulbright invited Clifford to a secret meeting in which he introduced the newly appointed Defense Secretary to two World War II heroes, General James M. Gavin and General Matthew Ridgway.Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.93 Both Gavin and Ridgway were emphatic that the United States could not win the war in Vietnam, and their opposition to the war helped to change Clifford's mind.Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.93 Despite his success with Clifford, Fulbright was close to despair as he wrote in a letter to Erich Frommn that this \\"literally a miasma of madness in the city, enveloping everyone in the administration and most of those in Congress. I am at a loss of words to describe the idiocy of what we are doing.\\"Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.93 Seeing that the Johnson administration was reeling in the wake of the Tet Offensive, Fulbright in February 1968 called for hearings by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee into the Gulf of Tonkin incident, as Fulbright noted that there were several aspects of the claim that North Vietnamese torpedo boats had attacked American destroyers in international waters that seemed dubious and questionable.Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.94-95 McNamara was subpoenaed, and the televised hearings led to \\"fireworks\\" as Fulbright repeatedly asked difficult answers about De Soto raids on North Vietnam and Operation 34A.Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.95 On 11 March 1968, Secretary of State Dean Rusk appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.95-96 Fulbright made his sympathies clear by wearing a tie decorated with doves carrying olive branches.Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000 p.483 Through Rusk was scheduled to testify about the Gulf of Tonkin incident, the previous day in The New York Times had appeared a leaked story that Westmoreland had requested for Johnson to send 206,000 more troops to Vietnam.Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.96 During Rusk's two days of testimony, the main issue turned out to be the troop request with Fulbright insisting for Johnson yo seek congressional approval first.Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.96 In response to Fulbright's questions, Rusk stated that if more troops were sent to Vietnam, the president would consult \\"appropriate members of Congress.\\"Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000 p.484 Most notably, several senators who had voted with Stennis and the other hawks now aligned themselves with Fulbright, which indicated that Congress was turning against the war.Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.96 In late October 1968, after Johnson announced a halt in bombing in North Vietnam in accordance with peace talks, Fulbright stated that his hopefulness that the announcement would lead to a general ceasefire. In March 1969, Secretary of State William P. Rogers testified at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the Nixon administration's foreign policy, Fulbright telling Rogers that the appearance was both useful and promising.Rogers Says U.S. Prepared For Mutual Troops Pullout In Vietnam (March 28, 1969) In April 1969, Fublright received a letter from a former soldier who served in Vietnam, Ron Ridenhour, containing the results of Ridenhour's investigation into the My Lai massacre, said that he had heard so many stories from other soldiers about a massacre that had happened in March 1968 at a village that the soldiers knew only as \\"Pinkville.\\"Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000 p.547 In May 1969, Fulbright delivered a speech at National War College that advocated for a U.S. withdraw from Vietnam in spite of possibly having to settle for something less than a standoff against the communists. He spoke for overhauling foreign policy to concentrate it less on the power of the executive branch.Fulbright, Symington Urge Military Cuts (May 21, 1969) On 15 October 1969, Fulbright spoke at one of the rallies held by the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam.Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.116 As all of the rallies held on 15 October were peaceful, Fulbright taunted a reporter who was hoping there would be violence: \\"I am sorry that you thought the demonstrations of 15 October were 'subversive and hysterical'. They seemed to me to be extremely well- behaved and a very serious demonstration of disapproval of the tragic mistake... in Vietnam.\\"Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.116 In response to the Moratorium protests, President Nixon went on national television on 3 November 1969 to give his speech asking for the support of the \\"silent majority\\" towards his Vietnam policy.Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.117 On 4 November, Fulbright told a journalist that Nixon had \\"fully and truthfully taken upon himself Johnson's war.\\"Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.117 Fulbright called for the second round of the Moratorium protests scheduled for 15 November to be canceled for fear that Nixon was planning to start a riot to discredit the antiwar movement.Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.117-118 The protests in the 15th went ahead and were peaceful, but the success of Nixon's \\"silent majority speech\\" left Fulbright depressed as he wrote at the time that \\"it is very distressing, indeed, to think that we eliminated LBJ only to end up with this, which is almost more than the human spirit can endure.\\"Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.118 However, on 12 November 1969 appeared in The New York Times an article by Seymour Hersh revealing the My Lai Massacre on 16 March 1968.Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.118 Fulbright was deeply shocked when he learned about what happened at May Lai: \\"it is a matter of the greatest importance and emphasizes in the most dramatic manner the brutalization of our society.\\"Berman, William William Fulbright and the Vietnam War, Kent: Kent State University Press, 1988 p.118 In 1970, Daniel Ellsberg offered Fulbright his copy of the Pentagon Papers to ask him to insert them into the Congressional Record, which would allow the media to cite them without fear of prosecution for publishing secret documents.Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000 p. 583 Fulbright declined and instead sent a letter to Defense Secretary Melvin Laird asking him to declassify the Pentagon Papers.Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2000 p.583 In 1971, Fulbright held another set of hearing about the Vietnam. The Fulbright Hearing included the notable testimony of Vietnam veteran and future Senator and Secretary of State John Kerry.  1970s  In February 1970, South Dakota Senator George McGovern accused the former Viet Cong detainee James N. Rowe of being dispatched by the Pentagon to criticize him, Fulbright, and Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, who had indicated their opposition to continued American involvement in Vietnam. On March 11, Fulbright introduced a resolution regarding the commitment of American troops or air forces for combat in Laos by Nixon, who, under the guidelines of the resolution, would not be able to combat forces in or over Laos without congressional affirmative action. In his address introducing the resolution, Fulbright said, \\"The Senate must not remain silent now while the President uses the armed forces of the United States to, fight an undeclared and undisclosed war in Laos.\\" The following month, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to repeal the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. Fulbright admitted the repeal would now have little to no legal impact and described the action as one intended to be part of an ongoing process of clearing out legislation that was now out of date. On August 22, Fulbright stated his support for a bilateral treaty to grant the United States authority to use military force to guarantee both \\"territory and independence of Israel within the borders of 1967\\" and that the proposed measure would obligate Israel not to violate those frontiers, which had been created prior to the Six-Day War. In October, Defense Department officials disclosed publication of testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee showing the United States entered a 1960 agreement supporting a 40,000-man Ethiopian army in addition to beginning Ethiopia's opposition to threats against its territorial integrity. Fulbright responded to the disclosure by saying the wording seemed to go \\"much further than saying a good word in the United Nations\\" and suggested the U.S. had agreed to aid the Ethiopian Emperor if the possibility of facing an internal insurrection arose. On February 28, 1971, Fulbright announced his intent to submit a bill compelling the Secretary of State and other Nixon administration officials to appear before Congress to explain their position on Vietnam. Fulbright said that the measure would be warranted by the refusal of William P. Rogers, Henry A. Kissinger, and other officials to appear before Congress. He reasoned that that they would not appear because \\"they know there are a number of people who don't agree with them, and it makes it embarrassing and they don't like it; they especially don't like to have it in front of television.\\" On October 31, Fulbright pledged his support to less-controversial aspects of foreign aid such as refugee relief and military aid to Israel and predicted the Nixon administration would be met with defeat or contention in the event of proposed aid for Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, and Greece. Fulbright said a meeting between the Foreign Relations Committee the following day would see \\"that some kind of interim program will probably be devised\\" and expressed his disdain for \\"the continuing resolution approach.\\" In March 1972, Fulbright sent a letter to Acting Attorney General Richard G. Kleindienst to request to the Justice Department not to use the Information Agency documentary Czechoslovakia 1968 for use in New York. He stated that it appeared to violate the 1948 law that created the agency, which he stated \\"was created for the purpose of the dissemination abroad of information about the United States, its people, and policies.\\" In April, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee announced the end of an inquiry into a drinking incident involving United States Ambassador to France Arthur K. Watson. Fulbright said that he did not expect the committee to pursue the matter and published a letter on the subject from Rogers. On August 3, the Senate approved the treaty limiting defense missiles for the United States and the Soviet Union. The following day, Fulbright held a closed meeting with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to form a strategy against the Nixon administration's attempts to attach additional reservations to the intercontinental missile agreement signed by Nixon the previous May.Senate Ratifies Treaty; Additions Irk Fulbright (August 4, 1972) On July 11, 1973, during a speech at an American Bankers Association meeting, Fulbright criticized Capitol Hill attempts to block trade concessions to the Soviet Union until it allowed the emigration of Jews and other groups: \\"Learning to live together in peace is the most important issue for the Soviet Union and the United States, too important to be compromised by meddling ‚Äî even idealistic meddling ‚Äî in each other's affairs.\\" In August, Nixon announced his choice of Kissinger to replace the retiring Rogers as Secretary of State. Ahead of the hearings, Kissinger was expected to have the advantage of cultivating relationships with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Vermont Senator George Aiken noting that Kissinger \\"met with us at Senator Fulbright's house for breakfast at least twice a year.\\" In November 1973, Fulbright endorsed the Middle East policy of Secretary of State Kissinger in a Senate speech, arguing for the central requirement of a peace requirement prior to \\"another military truce hardens into another untenable and illusory status quo\\" and added that both sides would need to make concessions. Fulbright stated that Washington, Moscow, and the United Nations were responsible for spearheading the peace settlement. In May 1974, Fulbright disclosed the existence of a weapon stockpile for South Korea, South Vietnam, and Thailand, and the Defense Department released a statement three days later that confirmed Fulbright's admission. Throughout 1974, Kissinger was investigated for his possible role in initiating wiretaps of 13 government officials and four newsmen from 1969 to 1971. In July, Fulbright stated that nothing significant had emerged from the Kissinger testimony during his nomination for Secretary of State the previous fall, and Fulbright indicated his belief that opponents of d√©tente with the Soviet Union were hoping to unseat Kissinger from the investigation into his role in the wiretapping.  Final election and later life  Fulbright left the Senate in 1974, after being defeated in the Democratic primary by then-Governor Dale Bumpers. His well-documented stances on Vietnam, the Middle East, and Watergate were out of step with the Arkansan majority, and his campaign powers had atrophied. Bumpers won by a landslide. Speaking to congressmen in the weeks after Fulbright's primary loss, Nixon mocked the defeat.Nixon Makes Pitch to Conservatives (June 3, 1974) At the time that he left the Senate, Fulbright had spent his entire 30 years in the Senate as the junior senator from Arkansas, behind John Little McClellan who entered the Senate two years before him. After his retirement, Fulbright practiced international law at the Washington, D.C. office of the law firm Hogan & Hartson from 1975‚Äì1993. On May 5, 1993, President Bill Clinton presented the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Fulbright at his eighty-eighth birthday celebration from the Fulbright Association.  Death and legacy  Fulbright died of a stroke in 1995 at the age of 89 in Washington, DC. A year later, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary dinner of the Fulbright Program held June 5, 1996 at the White House, President Bill Clinton said, \\"Hillary and I have looked forward for some time to celebrating this 50th anniversary of the Fulbright Program, to honor the dream and legacy of a great American, a citizen of the world, a native of my home state and my mentor and friend, Senator Fulbright.\\" Fulbright's ashes were interred at the Fulbright family plot in Evergreen Cemetery in Fayetteville, Arkansas. In 1996, The George Washington University renamed a residence hall in his honor. The J. William Fulbright Hall is located 2223 H Street, N.W., at the corner of 23rd and H Streets. It received historic designations as a District of Columbia historic site on January 28, 2010 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 18, 2010. On October 21, 2002, in a speech at the dedication of the Fulbright Sculpture at the University of Arkansas, Bill Clinton said, > I admired him. I liked him. On the occasions when we disagreed, I loved > arguing with him. I never loved getting in an argument with anybody as much > in my entire life as I loved fighting with Bill Fulbright. I'm quite sure I > always lost, and yet he managed to make me think I might have won.  Fulbright Program  The Fulbright Program was established in 1946 under legislation introduced by then-Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas. The Fulbright Program is sponsored by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the United States Department of State. Approximately 294,000 \\"Fulbrighters\\", 111,000 from the United States and 183,000 from other countries, have participated in the Program since its inception over sixty years ago. The Fulbright Program awards approximately 6,000 new grants annually. Currently, the Fulbright Program operates in over 155 countries worldwide. The Thank You Fulbright project was created in April 2012 to provide an annual opportunity for alumni and friends of the Fulbright program to celebrate Fulbright's legacy.

Its most notable releases are piano solos recorded by Jelly Roll Morton in December 1939 late in his career. History Established around 1939, General Records was a division of Consolidated Records, Inc., of New York City. The label was owned by pioneering sound engineer Hazard E. Reeves, of Reeves Sound Studios (1939‚Äì1944) in Manhattan.Sutton, Allan, and Kurt Nauck. American Record Labels and Companies: An Encyclopedia (1891‚Äì1943). Denver, Colorado: Mainspring Press, 2000. The audio fidelity is above average for the era, and most General discs were pressed in good quality shellac, although the quality declined as good shellac became scarce with the start of World War II. The most famous General Records are a series of recordings by Jelly Roll Morton. The recording sessions in December 1939 and January 1940 were the last in Morton's career.Reich, Howard, and William Gaines. Jelly's Blues The Life, Music, and Redemption of Jelly Roll Morton.

Most saw service as part of the United States Army Air Corps as observation aircraft with the designations O-1 and O-11, or as the attack aircraft designated the A-3 Falcon. U.S. Navy variants were used initially as fighter-bombers with the designation F8C Falcon, then as the first U.S. Marine Corps dive bombers with the name Helldiver. Two later generations of Curtiss dive-bombers would also be named Helldiver. The type was introduced in 1925 and saw first-line service in the United States until 1934. Curtiss Falcons fought in the Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932 in Brazil, used by the forces of S√£o Paulo. Design and development The Falcon XO-1 prototype was evaluated by the USAAC along with eleven other prototypes in 1924 and the Douglas XO-2 was declared the winner of that competition. So Curtiss re- engined the prototype with the Packard 1A-1500 for the 1925 trials, which it won. The engine failed to live up to expectations and the O-1 ordered by the Army was fitted with the 435 hp (324 kW) Curtiss V-1150 (D-12) engine. The aircraft was a conventional unequal-span biplane design with wooden wings, while the fuselage was built using aluminum tubing with steel tie rod bracing. The landing gear was fixed and the tail included a balanced rudder with a rear skid originally, later changed to a tailwheel. The initial A-3 Falcon order was placed in the winter of 1927 and delivery of the first plane was in October 1927. A total of 76 A-3s were received. Later, six aircraft were modified as pilot trainers with dual controls and redesignated A-3A. A second batch of 78 improved A-3Bs, based on the Curtiss O-1E, was purchased beginning in 1929. Operational history Reasonably successful as an observation aircraft, Falcons flew primarily in the 1st, 5th and 99th Observation Squadrons of the 9th Observation Group, Mitchel Field, New York. The A-3 Attack Falcon saw considerable use, in frontline service with the 8th, 13th and 19th Attack Squadrons of the 3rd Attack Group, Barksdale Field, Louisiana, and the 26th Attack Squadron in Hawaii from 1928 to 1934 and with reserve units until 1937. The U.S. Navy introduced the F8C-1 and F8C-3 Falcon as a shipboard fighter in 1927‚Äì1928. They were later redesignated OC-1 and OC-2 for Marine Corps use as an observation/bomber. The F8C-4 Helldiver variant initially saw service with the Navy, and the first production batch of 25 was transferred in 1931 to the Marine Corps. A total of 34 F8Cs redesignated as O2C-1 observation aircraft were also transferred to the Naval Reserve in 1931, serving with squadrons VN-10RD9, VN-11RD9, and VN-12RD9. Most of the 63 newer F8C-5/O2C-1 Helldivers also served with the Marines, remaining in service until 1936. The type was featured in multiple Hollywood films: Flight (1929), Hell Divers (1932) and King Kong (1933). Curtiss Falcon aircraft fought during the Brazil Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932, under the flag of S√£o Paulo. In Bolivia, the aircraft type also fought in the Chaco War (1932‚Äì1935), bombing Paraguayan troopers. The Colombian Air Force used Falcon F-8 and O-1 in the Colombia-Peru War in 1932-3.

The label was reactivated in 2006 by EMI, which owned the label and back catalogue at the time. Imperial is owned by Universal Music Group. Early years to 1979 When Imperial was founded in 1947, it concentrated on rhythm and blues (R&B;) and country music: Fats Domino, Frankie Ford, Ricky Nelson, and Slim Whitman. In the UK Imperial was distributed by London Records. During the 1950s and 1960s, Imperial released jazz albums by Sonny Criss, Charlie Mariano, Papa Celestin, Erskine Hawkins, and Harold Land. Imperial bought Aladdin in 1960 and Minit Records in 1963, having distributed Minit since 1960. During the 1950s, Imperial was one of the primary labels issuing a vast quantity of R&B; from New Orleans through their involvement with producer and writer Dave Bartholomew and in the 1960s with their distribution (and purchase, a few years later) of Minit. In 1963, after Imperial lost Fats Domino and Ricky Nelson to rival record companies, Chudd sold the label to Liberty Records. Under Liberty's management, the label enjoyed success with Irma Thomas, Johnny Rivers, Jackie DeShannon, Classics IV, and Cher. During the British Invasion, Liberty (whose recordings were distributed by EMI in the UK) licensed The Hollies, Billy J. Kramer, the Dakotas, and the Swinging Blue Jeans from EMI. Recordings by the Bonzo Dog Band and Kim Fowley were issued in the U.S. by Imperial. By 1970, the label had become part of Liberty's merger with United Artists Records but was phased out shortly after, with its roster transferred to United Artists. EMI acquired the Imperial Records catalogue with its acquisition of UA Records in 1979. 1990s to present Throughout the 1990s, EMI released CD compilations of Imperial artists that featured the original Imperial labels. In June 2006, EMI re-activated the Imperial Records imprint and announced that it would be the urban music division of Caroline Distribution, part of Virgin Records, spearheaded by the urban music veteran Neil Levine. The first signing to the imprint was Raptivism Records. Fat Joe signed with Virgin Records and Imperial Records. Imperial provided resources for developing urban artists with EMI's major labels, including Capitol Records and Virgin Records, which were merged into the Capitol Music Group in January 2007. Universal Music Group acquired the Capitol Music Group as part of its acquisition of EMI's recorded music operations in 2012. After a few releases, Imperial became dormant again.

It is attached either at the very top of the mast, or in fractional rigs between about 1/8 and 1/4 from the top of the mast. The other end of the forestay is attached to the bow of the boat. Often a sail is attached to the forestay. This sail may be a jib or a genoa. In a cutter rig, the jib or jibs are flown from stays in front of the forestay, perhaps going from the masthead to a bowsprit. The sail on the forestay is then referred to as the staysail or stays'l. A forestay might be made from stainless steel wire on a modern yacht, solid stainless steel rod, carbon rod, or ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (such as Spectra or Dyneema) on a high-performance racing boat, and galvanised wire or natural fibers on an older cutter or square-rigged ship.

The cells are usually brownish or greenish in color and are characteristic of having a slit-like furrow at the anterior. They are not known to produce any toxins. They are used to feed small zooplankton, which is the food source for small fish in fish farms. Many species of Cryptomonas can only be identified by DNA sequencing. Cryptomonas can be found in several marine ecosystems in Australia and South Korea.  Etymology  Cryptomonas has the meaning of hidden small flagellates from ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù and ‚Äúmonas‚Äù.  Genome Structure  Species within Cryptomonas contain four genomes: the nuclear, the nucleomorph, the plastid, and mitochondrial genomes. The plastid genome contains 118 kilobase pairs and is a result of one endosymbiosis event of ancient red alga. The study of genome structures of the genus has contributed to the life-history dependent dimorphism of Cryptomonas, which is discussed in details later in the section Dimorphism.  Functions  Cryptomonas are also photolithotrophs that contribute to oxygenic carbon fixation making them greatly critical to the carbon levels of fresh water environments.  Reproduction  Replication of Cryptomonas occurs in early summer when fresh water species are also reproducing. Cryptomonas replicates via mitosis that only takes about ten minutes. Sexual reproduction is not observed in this genus as many other genera of Cryptophytes also do not reproduce sexually.  Cell Structure  Organisms are asymmetric with a transparent membrane on the outside. The membrane is not ciliated. Cryptomonas cells are fairly large; they average about 40 micrometers in size and often take the shape of an oval or ovoid. There are two flagella present, yet the two flagella are not equally sized. One is shorter and curled and the other one is longer and straight. The two flagella are fixed to the cell by four unique microtubular roots. In addition, the flagella are lined with small hairs that allow for better movement. There are also contractile vacuoles that control the flow of water in and out. Two boat-shaped plastids are observed in the cells. In a secondary endosymbiosis event, the phagotrophic ancestor of the Cryptomonas presumably captured a red alga and reduced it to a complex plastid with four envelope membranes. The phycobilisomes of the former red algae were reduced until only phycoerythrin remained. Phycoerythrobilin, a type of red phycobilin pigment, is a chromophore discovered in cyanobacteria, chloroplasts of red algae and some Cryptomonads. Phycoerythrobilin is present in the phycobiliprotein phycoerythrin, the terminal acceptor of energy during the process of photosynthesis. The phycoerythrin was translocated into the thylakoid lumen with its chromophore composition altered; subsequently, phycobiliproteins with at least seven different absorption spectra evolved. Cryptomonas is distinguished by the purple phycoerythrin 566 as an accessory pigment, which gives the organisms a brownish color in appearance.  Behaviour  Cryptomonas are large in size, grow rather slowly, and are limited in nutrients. It also migrates between depths of water in order to reach depths that are ideal for photosynthesis and bacteriograzing, as well avoiding organisms that are their predators. Typically, they are found at depths of up to 102 meters and in a temperature range of -1.4 to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Cryptomonas seem to grow and survive with little competition. Cryptomonas swim actively. They rotate while moving and sometimes swim in helical motion.  Dimorphism  Life history-dependent dimorphism was first described in organisms in 1986. In Proteomonas, another genus of Cryptophyceae, the two morphs revealed large differences in cell size which apparently led to its discovery and subsequent recognition. Cryptomonas has been discovered to be another genus that possesses the characteristic of dimorphism. Traditionally, Cryptomonas was considered to be 3 separate genera: Chilomonas, Cryptomonas and Campylomonas. Before further molecular analysis, Cryptomonas have been characterized by mainly morphological characters, such as cell size, cell shape, number and color of plastids. However, it was still difficult to define Cryptomonas due to insufficient understanding of morphological characters and less-than adequate visibility of living cells using light microscopy alone to observe the cell structures. Also, laboratories had lacked the condition to detect the different stages of particular organisms. The furrow-gullet system was used as a standard for organization of genera for many years. Most other Cryptophyte genera have either furrow or gullet, but Cryptomonas is one of the genera that possess a combination of the two, creating a furrow-gullet complex. The furrow-gullet complex is used by the cells to digest food for smaller organisms. Also, ejectisomes are found to be surrounding the complex. Previously, different textures of furrow plates are used to classify genera. For example, a furrow plate (extending posteriorly along one side of the ventral furrow-gullet complex) has been described as ‚Äúscalariform‚Äù in Campylomonas yet ‚Äúfibrous‚Äù in Cryptomonas. In addition, in Cryptomonas, the inner periplast component consists of polygonal plates. In contrast, in Campylomonas, the inner periplast component is a continuous sheet-like layer. However, during later research, more evidence of both molecular phylogeny and morphology has been found to support the claim that the three genera should be considered one single dimorphic genus. Characters previously used to distinguish Cryptomonas from Campylomonas were found to occur together in dimorphic strains, such as the type of periplast (polygonal periplast plates versus a continuous periplast sheet), indicating that periplast types relate to different life- history stages of a single taxon. To evaluate the taxonomic significance of the type of periplast and other characters previously used to distinguish genera and species, molecular phylogenetic analyses have been used to study two nuclear ribosomal DNA regions (ITS2, partial LSU rDNA) and a nucleomorph ribosomal gene (SSU rDNA). The results of the phylogenetic study provide molecular evidence for a life history-dependent dimorphism in the genus Cryptomonas: the genus Campylomonas represents the alternate morph of Cryptomonas. Campylomonas and Chilomonas are reduced to synonyms of Cryptomonas.  Further research  In addition to plastids containing phycoerythrobilin, campylomorphs, formerly genera Campylomonas and Chilomonas, also contain a colorless plastid that lacks photosynthetic pigment: leucoplast. Since the complete loss of photopigments clearly distinguishes the leukoplastidious cryptophytes from Cryptomonas, the incorporation of ‚ÄúChilomonas‚Äù with Cryptomonas has been highly debatable. Scientist have not yet found out an explanation of how leucoplasts disappear during later life stage and when they disappear.

It is an important sail trim control and has a direct effect on the shape of the mainsail and the headsail. Backstays are generally adjusted by block and tackle, hydraulic adjusters, or lines leading to winches. Types Backstays may be permanent or running. A permanent backstay is attached to the top of the mast. Running backstays appear in pairs attached about two-thirds of the way up the mast (sometimes at multiple locations along the length of the mast). In general, most modern sailboats will have a permanent backstay and some will have a permanent backstay combined with running backstays. Backstays are not always found on all vessels, especially smaller ones. A permanent backstay is attached at the top of the mast and may or may not be readily adjustable. In a masthead rig, tensioning the permanent backstay will directly tension the forestay. This control is used to adjust the amount of \\"sag\\" in the headsail. In a fractional rig, tensioning the permanent backstay will have two effects: First, the forestay is tensioned (controls sag in headsail) and second, the mast bend is increased, particularly in the upper one-half to one-third of the mast. Increased mast bend tends to reduce the draft (camber) of the mainsail. A running backstay always attaches to the mast at a point below the top of the mast and is generally used in conjunction with a permanent backstay. Running backstays are found on both masthead rigs and fractional rigs. There are some rigs for which running backstays may be used without a permanent backstay. This occurs most often where the mainsail has a significant roach or a very large mainsail, especially combined with narrow hull beam. Gaff rigged boats invariably have running backstays with no permanent backstay. In both of these cases the mainsail extends aft of a line from masthead to stern, and so a permanent backstay would interfere with the operation of the sail. As a direct consequence of its attachment point (below the top of the mast) a running backstay is always adjustable because it must be manually engaged and disengaged during every tack or jibe. Adjusting the tension on the running backstay has two effects: First, the forestay is tensioned (controls sag in headsail) and Second, mast bend is increased (the mast becomes more bent). The overall effect of tensioning the running backstay is a shallower mainsail (less camber) combined with a reduction in headsail sag. If the running backstays lead to the mast where the forestay attaches, the effect of tensioning them will reduce sag in the headsail and second, increase mast bend and flatten the mainsail as a result. Both effects are desirable as the wind increases. Backstays as antennas On modern oceangoing yachts, the backstay is also commonly used as an antenna for Marine SSB radios and/or an amateur radio, accomplished by placing structural backstay insulators at either end of the backstay.

On a sailing boat, the shrouds are pieces of standing rigging which hold the mast up from side to side. There is frequently more than one shroud on each side of the boat. Usually a shroud will connect at the top of the mast, and additional shrouds might connect partway down the mast, depending on the design of the boat. Shrouds terminate at their bottom ends at the chain plates, which are tied into the hull. They are sometimes held outboard by channels, a ledge that keeps the shrouds clear of the gunwales.The Free Dictionary - ChannelThe Lore of Ships, ed. by Bengt Kihlberg. G√∂teborg :Tre tryckare & New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 1963. Shrouds are attached symmetrically on both the port and starboard sides. For those shrouds which attach high up the mast, a structure projecting from the mast must be used to increase the angle of the shroud at the attachment point, providing more support to the mast. On most sailing boats, such structures are called spreaders, and the shrouds they hold continue down to the deck. On large sailing ships, however, particularly square-riggers, the shrouds end at the projections (called tops or crosstrees) and their loads are carried into the mast slightly further down by futtock shrouds. Contrast with forestay and backstay.

Running backstays Standing rigging on a square- rigged vessel (illustrated left), which supports a mast comprising three steps: main, top, and topgallant (illustrated right). The shrouds support each section laterally and the stays support each, fore and aft. Standing rigging comprises the fixed lines, wires, or rods, which support each mast or bowsprit on a sailing vessel and reinforce those spars against wind loads transferred from the sails. This term is used in contrast to running rigging, which represents the moveable elements of rigging which adjust the position and shape of the sails. Historical development Early sailing vessels used rope of hemp or other fibers, which gave way to wire ropes of various types. Galvanized steel was common for the first half of the 20th century, continuing as an inexpensive option to its 1960s successor material‚Äîstainless steel cables and rods. In the late 20th Century, racing yachts adopted composite fiber lines for standing rigging, with the goal of reducing weight and windage aloft.  Materials  On modern yachts, standing rigging is often stainless steel wire, Nitronic-50 stainless steel rod or synthetic fiber. Semi-rigid stainless steel wire is by far the most common as it combines extreme strength, relative ease of assembling and rigging with reliability. Unlike rigid stainless steel rod, it is comparatively easy to recognize wear and stress as individual strands (normally 19) break often near a swage fitting, and can be inspected while standing. Solid rod stainless steel is more aerodynamic so is often used in extreme racing yachts but it is difficult to see stress as this requires profesional inspection such as dye penetrate testing or x-raying. Rod rigging is strongest when terminated with a cold head rather than swage fittings. This process requires a different, expensive machine but yields a more durable end fitting. Rod-type stays fail suddenly, often where the rod bends around a spreader. Bending can induce unseen stress fractures. Fore-and-aft rigged vessels Most fore-and-aft rigged vessels have the following types of standing rigging: a forestay, a backstay, and upper and lower shrouds (side stays). Less common rigging configurations are diamond stays and jumpers. Both of these are used to keep a thin mast in column especially under the load of a large down wind sail or in strong wind. Rigging parts include swageless terminals, swage terminals, shackle toggle terminals and fail-safe wire rigging insulators. Square-rigged vessels Triple deadeyes and lanyards used to tension shrouds. Whereas 20th-Century square-rigged vessels were constructed of steel with steel standing rigging, prior vessels used wood masts with hemp-fiber standing rigging. As rigs became taller by the end of the 19th Century, masts relied more heavily on successive spars, stepped one atop the other to form the whole, from bottom to top: the lower mast, top mast, and topgallant mast. This construction relied heavily on support by a complex array of stays and shrouds. Each stay in either the fore- and-aft or athwartships direction had a corresponding one in the opposite direction providing counter-tension. Fore-and-aft the system of tensioning started with the stays that were anchored in front each mast. Shrouds were tensioned by pairs of deadeyes, circular blocks that had the large-diameter line run around them, whilst multiple holes allowed smaller line‚Äîlanyard‚Äîto pass multiple times between the two and thereby allow tensioning of the shroud. =Lateral support= In addition to overlapping the mast below, the top mast and topgallant mast were supported laterally by shrouds that connected to either a platform, called a \\"top\\", or cross-wise beams, called \\"crosstrees\\", and anchored futtock shrouds from below that led to the lower mast. =Fore-and-aft support= Each additional mast segment was supported fore and aft by a series of stays that led forward. These lines were countered in tension by backstays, which were secured along the sides of the vessel behind the shrouds.

He was the father of Alan Lomax (also a distinguished collector of folk music) and Bess Lomax Hawes. Early life The Lomax family originally came from England with William Lomax, who settled in Rockingham County in what was then \\"the colony of North Carolina.\\" John Lomax was born in Goodman in Holmes County in central Mississippi, to James Avery Lomax and the former Susan Frances Cooper. In December 1869, the Lomax family traveled by ox cart from Mississippi to Texas. John Lomax grew up in central Texas, just north of Meridian in rural Bosque County.Porterfield, p. 10. His father raised horses and cattle and grew cotton and corn on the of bottomland that he had purchased near the Bosque River.Porterfield, p. 12. He was exposed to cowboy songs as a child.Porterfield, p. 18‚Äì19. At around nine he befriended Nat Blythe, a former slave hired as a farmhand by James Lomax. The friendship, he wrote later, \\"perhaps gave my life its bent.\\"Porterfield, p. 20. Lomax, whose own schooling was sporadic because of the heavy farmwork he was forced to do, taught Blythe to read and write, and Blythe taught Lomax songs including \\"Big Yam Potatoes on a Sandy Land\\" and dance steps such as \\"Juba\\". When Blythe was 21 years old, he took his savings and left. Lomax never saw him again and heard rumors that he had been murdered. For years afterward, he always looked for Nat when he traveled around the South.Charles Wolf and Kip Lornell, Life and Legend of Leadbelly (New York: Da Capo Press, [1992] 1999), p. 107. When he was about to turn twenty-one, and his legal obligation to work as apprentice on his father's farm was coming to an end, his father permitted him to take the profits from the crops of one of their fields. Lomax used this, along with the money from selling his favorite pony, to pay to further his education. In the fall of 1887, he attended Granbury College in GranburyPorterfield, p. 22. and in May 1888, he graduated and eventually became a teacher. He began his first job as a teacher at a country school in Clifton, southeast of Meridian.Porterfield, p. 25. As time went on, he grew tired of the low pay and country-school drudgery and he applied for work at Weatherford College in Weatherford in Parker County in the spring of 1889. He was hired as principal by the school's new president, David Switzer, who had previously been president of Granbury College until it was closed down and he was transferred to Weatherford.Porterfield, p. 26. In 1890, after having attended a summer course at Eastman Business College in Poughkeepsie, New York, Lomax returned to Texas where he became head of the Business Department of Weatherford College.Porterfield, p. 27‚Äì29. Each summer, between 1891 and 1894, he also attended the annual lecture-and-concert series at New York State's Chautauqua Institute, which pioneered adult education (and where Lomax himself would later lecture).Porterfield, p. 29. According to Porterfield, \\"There he improved his mathematics, struggled with Latin, listened to music that stirred him (opera and oratorios, light 'classics' of the day), and learned, for the first time, of two poets‚ÄîTennyson and Browning‚Äîwhose work would soon become an integral part of his intellectual equipment.\\"Porterfield, p. 30. Early career By this time, however, he had decided to further his education at a first-rate university. His first choice was Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. But he soon realized that he probably would not pass Vanderbilt's tough entrance examinations.Porterfield, p. 32. So, in 1895, at the age of 28, Lomax matriculated at the University of Texas at Austin, majoring in English literature, and undertaking almost a double course load (including Greek, Latin, and Anglo Saxon) and was graduated in two years. With a touch of Texas hyperbole, he later wrote: > Never was there such a hopeless hodge-podge, There was I, a Chautauqua- > educated country boy who couldn't conjugate an English verb or decline a > pronoun, attempting to master three other languages at the same time. ... > But I plunged on through the year, for since I was older than the average > freshman, I must hurry, hurry, hurry. I don't think I ever stopped to think > how foolish it all was.Porterfield, p. 34.Porterfield, p. 40‚Äì41. In his memoir, Adventures of a Ballad Hunter, Lomax recounts how he had arrived at the University of Texas with a roll of cowboy songs he had written down in childhood. He showed them to an English professor, Morgan Callaway, only to have them discounted as \\"cheap and unworthy,\\" prompting Lomax to take the bundle behind the men's dormitory and burn it. His interest in folksongs thus rebuffed, Lomax focused his attentions on more acceptable academic pursuits.Porterfield, p. 59‚Äì60. He joined the fraternity Phi Delta Theta and the Rusk Literary Society, as well as becoming an editor and later the editor- in-chief of the University of Texas Magazine.Porterfield, p. 41. During the summer of 1896, he attended a summer school program in Chicago studying languages.Porterfield, p. 43. In 1897, he became an associate editor of the Alcalde, a student newspaper.Porterfield, p. 45. After graduation in June 1897, he worked at the University of Texas as registrar for the next six years until the spring of 1903.Porterfield, p. 50.Porterfield, p. 68. He also had other duties such as being personal secretary to the President of the University, manager of Brackenridge Hall (the men's dormitory on campus), and serving on the Alumni Scholarship Committee.Porterfield, p. 71‚Äì72. Lomax joined a campus fraternity known as The Great and Honorable Order of Gooroos receiving the title \\"Sybillene Priest\\".Porterfield, p. 73. Sometime around July 1898 Lomax began an intense relationship with Miss Shirley Green of Palestine, Texas, to whom he had been introduced in 1897 by the President of the University of Texas.Porterfield, p. 53‚Äì66.Porterfield, p. 75‚Äì77. For four years, their friendship had its ups and downs, until June 1902, when Lomax met one of Green's acquaintances, Bess Baumann Brown from Dallas.Porterfield, p. 79‚Äì80. It ultimately emerged that the reason for Miss Green's reluctance to commit herself to an engagement to John Lomax had been her awareness that she was mortally ill with tuberculosis.Porterfield, p. 62‚Äì66. However, Lomax continued to exchange letters with Miss Green until a month before her death, which occurred in February 1903.Porterfield, p. 83. That year, Lomax accepted an offer to teach English at Texas A&M; University beginning in SeptemberPorterfield, p. 87. To bolster his credentials, in the meantime, he decided to enroll at the University of Chicago for a summer course.Porterfield, p. 89. Upon his return to Texas he became engaged to Miss Bess Brown and they married on June 9, 1904, in Austin.Porterfield, p. 94‚Äì95.Porterfield, p. 100. The couple settled down at College Station near the A&M; campus.Porterfield, p. 101. Their first child, Shirley, was born on August 7, 1905.Porterfield, p. 105. Lomax, aware of the deficiencies of his early education, still wished to improve himself, however, and on September 26, 1906, he jumped at the chance to attend Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as a graduate student, having previously received a $500 stipend: The Austin Teaching Fellowships.Porterfield, p. 106‚Äì108. Here he had the opportunity to study under Barrett Wendell and George Lyman Kittredge, two renowned scholars who actively encouraged his interest in cowboy songs.Porterfield, p. 114. Harvard, in fact, was the center of American folklore studies (then viewed as a subsidiary of English literature, itself a novel field of scholarship in comparison with the more traditional study of rhetoric focused on classical languages and geared to preparing lawyers and clergy). Kittredge, in addition to being a well-known scholar of Chaucer and Shakespeare, had inherited the professorship in English literature previously held by Francis James Child, whose courses he continued to teach and whose great, unfinished eight-volume edition of the Popular Ballads of England and Scotland he brought to completion. > It was Kittredge who pioneered modern methods of ballad study, and who > encouraged collectors to get out of their armchairs and library halls and to > get out into the countryside to collect ballads first hand. When he met John > Lomax in 1907, this was what he encouraged him to do; the cowboy songs Lomax > had been writing down were glimpses into a whole new world, and Lomax should > follow up on his work. \\"Go and get this material while it can be found,\\" he > told the young Texan. \\"Preserve the words and music. That's your job.\\"Wolfe > and Lornell (1999) p. 108. Wendell and Kittredge continued to play an important advisory role in Lomax's career after he returned to Texas in June 1907 to resume his teaching position at A&M; after completing his Master of Arts degree. This included a visit by the two professors to Texas during which Lomax took them to a Sunday service in an African-American church. Soon after his return to Austin, John Lomax's son, John Jr., Retrieved on 24 November 2014 was born, on June 14, 1907.Porterfield, p. 123.Porterfield, p. 127. Galvanized by Kittredge's advice and support, Lomax had begun collecting cowboy songs and ballads,Wilgus situates Lomax's collecting as follows: > Three traditions guided the collecting [in the United States]: the academic, > which, following Child, sought accurate transcriptions of text first and > music later for scholarly study; the local enthusiastic, which searched out > and displayed the quaint, the unusual, the exciting, the enjoyable in > undisciplined and mercurial fashion; and the musical aesthetic, which sought > the distinguishable art form of the folk tune for appreciation and > performance. The collectors themselves were academics, whether somewhat > detached leaders of regional activity or lone workers aided by chance > location, early upbringing, or special interest. Or they were interested > amateurs in that they began and pursued their labors for a wide variety of > reasons unrelated to the values of disinterested scholarship. A union of > both types of collector, in the person of John A. Lomax, enriched the > greatest collection of all, the Archive of American Folk Song (Library of > Congress). ‚ÄîD. K. Wilgus, Anglo-American Folksong Scholarship Since 1898 > (Rutgers, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 1959), p. XV. although he paid generous tribute to John A. Lomax's greatness as a collector, as a first-generation professional academic folklorist, Wilgus could be harshly critical. In particular, although he acknowledged the accuracy of Lomax's transcriptions and notations of sources, he objected to his having published composite versions of the songs in his books intended for the public. but his work was interrupted on February 7, 1908, when \\"The Great A&M; Strike\\" broke out. The strike, caused by student dissatisfaction with the administration,Porterfield, p. 131. continued even after February 14, 1908, when the University, in a conciliatory gesture, fired some of its administrators. Unable to teach because of the strike, Lomax decided to see about resuming his collecting of cowboy ballads with a view to publishing them in a book. Encouraged by Wendell, he applied for and was awarded a Sheldon Fellowship grant.Porterfield, p. 140. In June 1908, Lomax became a full professor at A&M.; That August the strike ended when the President of the University resigned.Porterfield, p. 133‚Äì135. In June 1910, Lomax accepted an administrative job at the University of Texas as \\"Secretary of the University Faculties and Assistant Director of the Department of Extension.\\"Porterfield, p. 147. In November 1910 the anthology, Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads, was published by Sturgis and Walton, with an introduction by then- former president Theodore Roosevelt. Among the songs included were \\"Jesse James\\", \\"The Old Chisholm Trail\\", \\"Sweet Betsy From Pike\\", and \\"The Buffalo Skinners\\" (which George Lyman Kittredge considered \\"one of the greatest western ballads\\" and which was praised for its Homeric quality by Carl Sandburg and Virgil Thomson.)Lomax, Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads, p. xxi. From the first, John Lomax insisted on the inclusiveness of American culture. Some of the most famous songs in the book ‚Äî \\"Git Along Little Dogies\\", \\"Sam Bass,\\" and \\"Home on the Range\\" ‚Äî were sourced from African- American cowboys. Before Home on the Range was published Lomax recorded a black saloon keeper in San Antonio singing it on an Edison cylinder. Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads emerged as a major collection of Western songs and had \\"a profound effect on other folk song students.\\".Wolfe and Lornell (1999), p. 109. According to noted folklore scholar, D. K. Wilgus, the book's publication \\"sparked a great surge of interest in folk songs of all kinds, and in fact, inspired a search for folk material in all regions of the nation.\\"D. K. Wilgus, Anglo American Folk Song Scholarship since 1898, quoted in Wolfe and Lornell, ibid. Its success transformed John A. Lomax into a nationally known figure.Porterfield, pp.;150‚Äì52.Porterfield, p. 157.Charles Wolfe and Kip Lornell (in Life and Legend p. 109), state that a few months after the publication of Cowboy Songs, Lomax was elected president of the American Folklore Society. Other sources say he served in 1912 and 13. (see note below). The website of the American Folklore Society, which was founded by Rutherford B. Hayes and Mark Twain, does not list its presidents for the years before 1942. Texas Folklore Society Around the same time, Lomax and Professor Leonidas Payne of the University of Texas at Austin co-founded the Texas Folklore Society, following Kittredge's suggestion that Lomax establish a Texas branch of the American Folklore Society. Lomax and Payne hoped that the society would further their own research while kindling an interest in folklore among like-minded Texans. On Thanksgiving Day, 1909, Lomax nominated Payne as president of the society, and Payne nominated Lomax as first secretary. The two set out to marshal support, and a month later, Killis Campbell, an associate professor at the University, publicly proposed the formation of the Society at a meeting of the Texas State Teachers Association in Dallas.Porterfield, p. 141. By April 1910, there were 92 charter members.The 1910 promotional pamphlet for the society, prepared mostly by Leonidas Payne (and largely based on Henry M. Belden 1906's pamphlet for the Missouri Folklore Society), explained the society's purpose and suggested the following guidelines to workers: > For the collector of Folk-Lore, the most important virtue is accuracy; and > the value of any contribution is destroyed if it is not given just as it was > told or sung or described, with no changes whatever, even when such change > seems necessary to make sense. Second to accuracy, it is of great importance > that full information be supplied, when possible, as to the source of the > contribution, the informant, whence he has obtained the material, how long > it has been current, and any other date that may be of aid to the student. > Whenever it is possible, a transcript in the exact words of the informant is > best ‚Äì colloquialisms, meaningless words, mistakes, and all‚Äîand, in the case > of ballads and much of the other work, such exactness is necessary. The > following questions may be of use to the collector: *1. Have you recorded > the material just as you found it, mistakes and all? *2. Where, when, and > from whom did you get it? *3. Did you take it from recitation, from old > manuscript, from singing, or write it out from memory? *4. When, where, and > from whom did your informant get it? (Quoted in Francis Edward Abernethy, The Texas Folklore Society: 1909‚Äì1943, [Denton: University of North Texas Press, 1992, 1994], p. 30.) The Society's first annual meeting was held in 1911 on the University of Texas campus. Lomax then used his prestige as a nationally known author to travel the country raising money for folklore studies and to establish other state folklore societies. \\"He was among the first scholars to present papers about American folk songs to the Modern Language Association, the nation's leading organization of teachers of languages and literature. For the next several years he hit the lecture circuit, traveling so often that his wife, Bess Brown, had to help him with his schedules and even some of his speeches.\\" His lectures on cowboy songs, ballads and poetry took him all across the eastern USA.Porterfield, p. 176‚Äì179. For example, in December 1911, Lomax made a successful performance at Cornell University, singing and reciting some of the cowboy songs he had collected.Porterfield, p. 143‚Äì144. Sometimes he would have a chorus of college students dress up as cowboys to add interest to his presentations. Lomax's abiding interest in African-American folklore was also in evidence, for he had plans to publish another book within a year that consisted of folk songs collected from African-Americans. Although the book failed to materialize, he did publish (in the Journal of American Folklore, December 1912) \\"Stories of an African Prince\\", a collection of 16 African stories, which he had obtained through his correspondence with a young Nigerian student, Lattevi Ajayi.Porterfield, p. 171‚Äì173. In 1912, with the backing of Kittredge, John A. Lomax was elected president of the American Folklore Society, with Kittredge (himself a former president of the society) as First Vice President. He was re-elected for a second term in 1913.See: Rosemary Levy Zumwalt, American Folklore Scholarship: a Dialogue of Dissent (University of Indiana Press, 1988), p. 36. Ballad scholar James Francis Child also served two terms as president, in 1888 and 1889; Kittredge had been president in 1904. The Journal of the American Folklore Society was edited then and for many years afterward by anthropologist Franz Boas, who was succeeded by Ruth Benedict. In 1922, J. Frank Dobie became secretary-treasurer of the Texas Folklore Society, a job he was to hold for 21 years. Lomax's second son (and third child), Alan, was born on January 15, 1915. In time, Alan Lomax would prove a worthy successor of his father. A second daughter, Bess, was born in 1921, and she too had a distinguished career, both as a performer and teacher. The Texas Folklore Society grew gradually over the next decade, with Lomax steering it forward. At his invitation, Kittredge and Wendell attended its meetings. Other early members were Stith Thompson and J. Frank Dobie, who both began teaching English at the university in 1914. In 1915, at Lomax's recommendation, Stith Thompson became the society's secretary-treasurer. In 1916, Lomax's voluminous encyclopedia, The Book of Texas, which he had written jointly with Harry Yandall Benedict, was published. The same year, Stith Thompson edited the first volume of the Publications of the Texas Folklore Society, which Dobie reissued as Round the Levee in 1935. This publication exemplified the society's express purpose, and the motivation behind Lomax's own work: to gather a body of folklore before it disappeared, and to preserve it for the analysis of later scholars. These early efforts foreshadowed what would become Lomax's greatest achievement, the collection of more than ten thousand recordings for the Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress. In the inaugural issue of the Publications of the Texas Folklore Society, John A. Lomax urged the collection of Texas folklore: \\"Two rich and practically unworked fields in Texas are found in the large Negro and Mexican populations of the state.\\" He adds, \\"Here are many problems of research that lie close at hand, not buried in musty tomes and incomplete records, but in vital human personalities.\\"Lomax, \\"Unexplored Treasures of Texas Folk-Lore\\", pp. 101‚Äì102. The Texas Folklore Society also sought to collect and preserve the folklore and dialects of other non-English-speaking inhabitants of Texas. Throughout the next seven years he continued his research and lecture tours assisted and encouraged by his wife and children. All this came to an end on July 16, 1917, however, when Lomax was fired along with six other faculty members as the result of a political battle between Governor James E. Ferguson and the University President, Dr. R. E. Vinson. Lomax moved to Chicago to take a job selling bonds at Lee, Higginson & Co; a bond brokerage firm run by the son of his old professor Barrett Wendell. A few months later, Ferguson was impeached and the Board of Regents rescinded its dismissal of the faculty. Lomax judged that it would be wrong to leave his post at Lee, Higginson & Co so soon after arriving, especially with regards to his friendship with the family of Barrett Wendell, so he remained in Chicago for eighteen months until the war ended.For an account of the Vinson-Ferguson dispute and Lomax's role in it, see Jim Nicar, \\"The Defenders, 1913‚Äì1926: The Association Saves the University from an Educational Infanticide.\\", in the January 2010 issue of The Alcade, the magazine of the Texas Exes, the University of Texas Alumni Association, largely founded by Lomax . There he struck up a what turned out to be a lifelong friendship with Chicago poet Carl Sandburg, who frequently mentions him in his book, American Songbag (1927). In 1919, his next book, Songs of the Cattle Trail and Cow Camp, an anthology of cowboy poetry, was published by Macmillan. That year Lomax returned to Texas to be secretary of the Texas Exes, which had become financially independent of the University, so as to avoid further interference from politicians. Nevertheless, interference struck, when Ferguson, whom the law prohibited from holding office, ran his wife, Miriam A. Ferguson, as his surrogate. As governor, Mrs. Ferguson was able to pack the board of regents and oust John from his job as editor of The Alcade, which during his tenure was a 100-page long publication. Seeing how the wind was blowing, Lomax resigned his secretaryship and joined the Republic Bank of Dallas in 1925. The economic crash of 1929 presaged bad things for the bank, however. Archive of American Folk Song \\"Uncle\\" Rich Brown in 1940 Tragedy struck the Lomax family in 1931 when Lomax's beloved wife Bess Brown died at the age of 50, leaving four children (the youngest, Bess, only ten years old). In addition, the Dallas bank at which Lomax worked failed: he had to phone his customers one by one to announce that their investments were all worthless. In debt and unemployed and with two school-age children to support, the sixty-five-year-old went into a deep depression. In hope of reviving his father's spirits, his oldest son, John Lomax Jr. encouraged him to begin a new series of lecture tours. They took to the road, camping out by the side of the road to save money, with John Jr. (and later Alan Lomax) serving the senior Lomax as driver and personal assistant. In June 1932, they arrived at the offices of the Macmillan publishing company in New York City. Here Lomax proposed his idea for an anthology of American ballads and folksongs, with a special emphasis on the contributions of African Americans. It was accepted. In preparation he traveled to Washington to review the holdings in the Archive of American Folk Song of the Library of Congress. By the time of Lomax's arrival, the Archive already contained a collection of commercial phonograph recordings that straddled the boundaries between commercial and folk, and wax cylinder field recordings, built up under the leadership of Robert Winslow Gordon, Head of the Archive, and Carl Engel, chief of the Music Division. Gordon had also experimented in the field with a portable disc recorder, but had had neither time nor resources to do significant fieldwork. Lomax found the recorded holdings of the Archive woefully inadequate for his purposes. He therefore made an arrangement with the Library whereby it would provide recording equipment, obtained for it by Lomax through private grants, in exchange for which he would travel the country making field recordings to be deposited in the Archive of the Library, then the major resource for printed and recorded material in the United States After the departure of Robert Gordon from the Library in 1934, John A. Lomax was named Honorary Consultant and Curator of the Archive of American Folk Song, a title he held until his death in 1948. His work, for which he was paid a salary of one dollar, included fund raising for the Library, and he was expected to support himself entirely through writing books and giving lectures. Lomax secured grants from the Carnegie Corporation and the Rockefeller Foundation, among others, for continued field recordings. He and Alan recorded Spanish ballads and vaquero songs on the Rio Grande border and spent weeks among French-speaking Cajuns in southern Louisiana. Thus began a ten-year relationship with the Library of Congress that would involve not only John but the entire Lomax family, including his second wife, Ruby Terrill Lomax, Professor of Classics and Dean of Women at the University of Texas, whom he married in 1934. His sons and daughters assisted with his folksong research and with the daily operations of the Archive: Shirley, who performed songs taught to her by her mother; John Jr., who encouraged his father's association with the Library; Alan Lomax who accompanied John on field trips and who from 1937‚Äì42 served as the Archive's first paid (though very nominally) employee as Assistant in Charge; and Bess, who spent her weekends and school vacations copying song texts and doing comparative song research. Field recordings Through a grant from the American Council of Learned Societies, Lomax was able to set out in June 1933 on the first recording expedition under the Library's auspices, with Alan Lomax (then eighteen years old) in tow. As now, a disproportionate percentage of African American males were held as prisoners. Robert Winslow Gordon, Lomax's predecessor at the Library of Congress, had written (in an article in the New York Times, c. 1926) that, \\"Nearly every type of song is to be found in our prisons and penitentiaries\\"Ted Gioia, Work Songs (Durham: Duke University Press, 2006), p. 209. Folklorists Howard Odum and Guy Johnson also had observed that, \\"If one wishes to obtain anything like an accurate picture of the workaday Negro he will surely find his best setting in the chain gang, prison, or in the situation of the ever-fleeing fugitive.\\"Quoted in Ted Gioia, Work Songs, p. 205. But what these folklorists had merely recommended John and Alan Lomax were able to put into practice. In their successful grant application they wrote, following Odum, Johnson and Gordon's hint, that prisoners, \\"Thrown on their own resources for entertainment ... still sing, especially the long-term prisoners who have been confined for years and who have not yet been influenced by jazz and the radio, the distinctive old-time Negro melodies.\\" They toured Texas prison farms recording work songs, reels, ballads, and blues from prisoners such as James \\"Iron Head\\" Baker, Mose \\"Clear Rock\\" Platt, and Lightnin' Washington. By no means were all of those whom the Lomaxes recorded imprisoned, however: in other communities, they recorded K.C. Gallaway and Henry Truvillion. In July 1933, they acquired a state-of-the-art, phonograph uncoated-aluminum disk recorder. Installing it in the trunk of his Ford sedan, Lomax soon used it to record, at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, a twelve-string guitar player by the name of Huddie Ledbetter, better known as \\"Lead Belly,\\" whom they considered one of their most significant finds. During the next year and a half, father and son continued to make disc recordings of musicians throughout the South. In contrast to earlier amateur collectors, the Lomaxes were also among the first to attempt to apply scholarly methodology in their work, though they did not adhere to the strict empirical positivism adopted by the subsequent generation of academic folklorists, who believed in refraining from drawing conclusions about the data they amassed.The first Ph.D. in folklore was awarded in 1953. For an account of the history of the professionalization of the discipline and its struggle to emerge from its former identity as a subsection between literature and anthropology, see Rosemary Levy Zumwalt, American Folklore Scholarship: a Dialogue of Dissent (University of Indiana Press, 1988). The following year (in July 1934), they visited Angola once again. This time Lead Belly begged them to make a recording of a song he had written to take to the Governor requesting parole, which they did. However, unbeknownst to them, Lead Belly was released in August for good time (and because of cost-cutting due to the Depression) and not because of the Lomaxes' recording, which the Governor may not have listened to. In September 1934, Lead Belly wrote to Lomax requesting employment, since he needed to have a job in order not to be sent back to prison. At the urging of John Jr., Lomax engaged Lead Belly as his driver and assistant, and the pair traveled the South together collecting folk songs for the next three months. Then, in December 1934, Lead Belly famously performed illustrating John Lomax's scheduled lecture of folk songs at a smoker and sing-along held at the national MLA meeting in Philadelphia (see Lead Belly). Their association continued for three more months until the following March (1935). In January, Lomax, who knew nothing whatever about the recording business, became Lead Belly's manager and, through a friend, cowboy singer Tex Ritter, got Lead Belly a recording contract with the famous A&R; man Art Satherly of ARC records. Satherly had publicity photos made of the singer wearing overalls and sitting on sacks of grain, garb and setting that were customary in commercial publicity photos of country singers in those days.And continued until much later, as in the outfits worn by the country artists on the television series Hee Haw. But Lead Belly's recordings, marketed as race music, failed to sell. A filmed re-enactment in early 1935 for The March of Time newsreelThe early March of Time news series routinely used re-enactments and dramatizations since film and sound technology were not yet sufficiently advanced for on location filming of news events of Lomax's discovery of Lead Belly in prison, led to the myth that John Lomax made Lead Belly perform in prison stripes (which is inaccurate). He did perform in overalls, however. During Lomax's two-week lecture tour with Lead Belly on the eastern college circuit in March 1935 (pre-scheduled by Lomax before teaming up with Lead Belly), the two men quarreled over money and never spoke to one another again. John A. Lomax has been accused of paternalism and of tailoring Lead Belly's repertoire and clothing during his brief association with Lead Belly.For example, see Hugh Barker and Yuval Taylor's Faking It: The Quest for Authenticity in Popular Music, W. W. Norton: 2007. \\"But,\\" writes jazz historian Ted Gioia, > few would deny the instrumental role he played in the transformation of the > one-time convict into a commercially successful performer of traditional > African American music. The turnabout in his life was rapid and profound: > Lead Belly was released from prison on August 1, 1934; his schedule for the > last week of December that year included performances for the MLA gathering > in Philadelphia, for an afternoon tea in Bryn Mawr, and for an informal > gathering of professors from Columbia and NYU. Even by the standards of the > entertainment industry ... this was a remarkable transformation.Ted Gioia, > Work Songs, p. 207‚Äì208. After his three-months as a performer illustrating John A. Lomax's lectures, Lead Belly went on to a 15-year career as an independent artist, championed and assisted intermittently (but not managed) by Alan Lomax. In 1938 John Lomax visited noted writer Ben Robertson in Pickens County, South Carolina and Ben introduced him to the all-day singing festivals of the area which enabled Lomax to preserve the lyrics of many local folksongs. The scope of the collection The Archive of American Folk Song of the Library of Congress contains songs collected in 33 states of the Union and certain parts of the West Indies, The Bahamas, and Haiti. As Curator and Assistant in Charge of the Folk Song Collection John and Alan Lomax supervised and worked with many other folklorists, musicologists, and composers, amateur and professional, all over the country, amassing more than ten thousand records of vocal and instrumental music on aluminum and acetate discs along with many pages of written documentation. In his 1942 introduction to the multi-volume Checklist of Recorded Folk Song in the Library of Congress, Harold Spivacke, Chief of the Library of Congress's Division of Music, wrote: > Many hard-working and expert folklorists cooperated in the accumulation of > this material, but in the main the development of the Archive of American > Folk Song represents the work of two men, John and Alan Lomax.

After 1942, field work of collecting folk songs under government auspices was discontinued due to a shortage of acetate needed for the war effort. But the work had aroused the ire and suspicion of Southern conservatives in Congress who were fearful it could be used as a cover for civil and worker rights agitation, and because of congressional opposition it has never been resumed. Legacy John A. Lomax's contribution to the documentation of American folk traditions extended beyond the Library of Congress Music Division through his involvement with two agencies of the Works Progress Administration. In 1936, he was assigned to serve as an advisor on folklore collecting for both the Historical Records Survey and the Federal Writers' Project. Lomax's biographer, Nolan Porterfield, notes that the outlines of the famed WPA State Guides resulting from this work resemble Lomax and Benedict's earlier Book of Texas.Porterfield, p. 386. As the Federal Writers' Project's first Folklore Editor, Lomax also directed the gathering of ex-slave narratives and devised a questionnaire for project fieldworkers to use. > The WPA project to interview former slaves assumed a form and a scope that > bore Lomax's imprint and reflected his experience and zeal as a collector of > folklore. His sense of urgency inspired the efforts in several states. And > his prestige and personal influence enlisted the support of many project > officials, particularly in the deep South, who might otherwise have been > unresponsive to requests for materials of this type. One might question the > wisdom of selecting Lomax, a white SouthernerLomax did think of himself as a > Southerner, and detractors (such as Hungarian-born Marxist Lawrence Gellert) > routinely painted him as a stereotypical Southern white conservative > (Gellert claimed Lomax embodied \\"the slave-master attitude intact\\", see > Wolfe and Lornell, p. 194). John Lomax's racial attitudes, however, formed > during the more optimistic period of Reconstruction, arguably reflected > rather a Western populism and conservative stiff-upper-lip, \\"bootstrap\\" > individualism. The issue is explored in Alan B. Govenar's Texas Blues: The > Rise of a Contemporary Sound (Texas A&M; University Press, 2008), pp. 16‚Äì20. > to direct a project involving the collection of data from black former > slaves. Yet whatever racial preconceptions Lomax may have held do not appear > to have had an appreciable effect upon the Slave Narrative Collection. > Lomax's instructions to interviewers emphasized the necessity of obtaining a > faithful account of the ex-slave's version of his or her experience. \\"It > should be remembered that the Federal Writers' Project is not interested in > taking sides on any question. The worker should not censor any materials > collected regardless of its nature.\\" Lomax constantly reiterated his > insistence that the interviews be recorded verbatim, with no holds barred. > In his editorial capacity he closely adhered to this dictum.From Norman R. > Yetman's online introduction to the Library of Congress Slave Narrative > Website \\"John Lomax's Leadership and the Issue of Race\\". Upon Lomax's departure this work was continued by Benjamin A. Botkin, who succeeded Lomax as the Project's folklore editor in 1938, and at the Library in 1939, resulting in the invaluable compendium of authentic slave narratives: Lay My Burden Down: A Folk History of Slavery, edited by B. A. Botkin (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1945).Porterfield observes that Lomax's withdrawal from the WPA in 1938 \\"was eased\\" by hostility from \\"elistists\\" within the American Folklore Society, which had twice honored Lomax by electing him president. They > now declared him unacceptable because he lacked a Ph.D. Some observers > attributed this action to the jealousy of certain academics over the > commercial success of Lomax's books. ... Whatever the motive, at its annual > meeting in 1938 the American Folklore Society adopted a resolutions > distancing itself from the material from the Federal Writers' Project under > Lomax's direction. It would be acceptable only if collected under \\"expert > guidance\\" (in other words by an academic with specialized training). > [Lomax's] only response to the AFS's snub was the wry observation, sometime > later, that \\"perhaps the collector must go out among the people dressed in > cap and gown.\\" After a few months, WPA director, Henry Alsberg] named as > Lomax's successor Benjamin Botkin, A.B. Harvard (magna cum laude), M.A. > Columbia, Ph.D. University of Nebraska, editor, professor at the University > of Oklahoma, and contributor to learned journals. At its next annual > meeting, the AFS \\"noted with interest\\" the appointment of Botkin, \\"a trained > folklorist\\" and now expressed a willingness to cooperate with his WPA > projects. > Harold Preece, a WPA staffer in Texas, once asked Lomax what he thought of > Botkin's work in Oklahoma? Botkin's work was interesting, responded Lomax, > but it wasn't the sort of thing he did; moreover, \\"how much is Botkin and > how much is folklore, only he knows.\\" Ironically, despite Botkin's > impeccable credentials, within a decade he had also earned the enmity of > academics for publishing \\"popular\\" books and was cast from the fold. (See > Porterfield, pp. 407‚Äì408) Lomax's mentor, the distinguished professor, George Lyman Kittredge, also possessed no doctorate. Francis James Child, the founder of American folklore studies and the first person to hold the title of \\"Professor of English\\", and later of modern languages at Harvard University, possessed several honorary doctorates from German Universities, but none from America or Britain. For more on the Federal Writers' Project see Jerre Mangione's The Dream and the Deal: The Federal Writers' Project, 1935‚Äì1943 (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1983). See also Gerald Graff, Professing Literature, an Institutional History (University of Chicago Press, 1989) for an account of the development of the professionalization of literary studies. John A. Lomax served as president of the Texas Folklore Society for the years 1940‚Äì41, and 1941‚Äì42. In 1947 his autobiography Adventures of a Ballad Hunter (New York: Macmillan) was published and was awarded the Carr P. Collins prize as the best book of the year by the Texas Institute of Letters. The book was immediately optioned to be made into a Hollywood movie starring Bing Crosby as Lomax and Josh White as Lead Belly, but the project was never realized. In 1932, Lomax met his friend, Henry Zweifel, a rancher and businessman then from Cleburne in Johnson County, while both were volunteers for Orville Bullington's Republican gubernatorial race against the Democrat Miriam Ferguson. Lomax's old enemy, James Ferguson, was virtually running his wife's comeback attempt at the governorship.Nolan Porterfield, Last Cavalier: The Life and Times of John A. Lomax, 1867-1948, p. 371 Lomax died of a stroke at the age of eighty in January 1948. On June 15 of that year, Lead Belly gave a concert at the University of Texas, performing children's songs such as \\"Skip to My Lou\\" and spirituals (performed with his wife Martha) that he had first sung years before for the late collector.Charles Wolfe and Kip Lornell, The Life and Legend of Leadbelly (New York: Da Capo Press, 1999 [1992]), p. 254. In 2010, John A. Lomax was inducted into the Western Music Hall of Fame for his contributions to the field of cowboy music. Following in his grandfather's footsteps, Lomax's grandson John Lomax III is a nationally published United States music journalist, author of Nashville: Music City USA (1986), Red Desert Sky (2001) and co-author of The Country Music Book (1988). He is also an artist manager and has represented Townes Van Zandt, Steve Earle, Rocky Hill, David Schnaufer and The Cactus Brothers. He began representing the Dead Ringer Band in 1996. John Lomax III was also a music writer for Houston's early-'70s underground newspaper, Space City! John Lomax III's son John Nova Lomax also kept up the family tradition. While serving as the former music editor of the Houston Press, John Nova Lomax won an ASCAP Deems Taylor award for music journalism for his profile of troubled former country music superstar Doug Supernaw. John Nova Lomax also helped discover rising country troubadour Hayes Carll. Since 2008, John Nova Lomax has been a staff writer at the Houston Press. In 2010, 100 years after his great-grandfather published his first book, John Nova Lomax published his own first book: Houston's Best Dive Bars: Drinking and Diving in the Bayou City.

They are accomplished ambush predators that spend most of their time in a sock-like, silken retreat on the ground from where they kill their prey. Distribution Sphodros and Atypus occur in North America, while Atypus and Calommata occur in Asia and Africa. Only Atypus species are found in Europe. Atypus affinis, Atypus muralis, and Atypus piceus are the only mygalomorph spiders found in northwestern Europe. Biology Atypus builds a silken tube parallel to the surface of the ground. While up to 8 cm of the tube lie on the ground, about 20 cm are buried vertically. The spider rests at the bottom of the tube. When prey walks on the exposed part, the spider, alerted by the vibrations, stabs the prey through the silk, cuts the web and drags the prey inside to be eaten. Calommata species, instead of building a purse web, live in burrows. Sphodros spp. usually prop their tubes against a tree trunk. Atypical tarantulas have huge chelicerae for their size and relatively long spinnerets (although not as long as those found in diplurids). The males are sometimes brightly colored and wander around looking for females in their tubes. The females are reddish- brown or dark-colored. During the breeding season for A. affinis, the male leaves his own burrow and goes in search of females. When he finds the burrow of a female, he tentatively taps on the wall of the purse web, and if the female is receptive, he ventures into the confines of the burrow. The two spiders mate and cohabit until the male dies, when the female eats him. The female makes an egg sac and hangs it in her burrow. The next summer, the eggs hatch, and the spring after that, the spiderlings leave their mother's burrow and wander off to find a suitable place to build a lair of their own. Southeast Asian Atypus species have a body length of 7 to 21 mm in females, and about 12 mm in males. Calommata spp. of this region grow from 23 to 30 mm in females, and only about 7 mm in males.

They are thought to be vestiges of primitive red and green algal nuclei that were engulfed by a larger eukaryote. Because the nucleomorph lies between two sets of membranes, nucleomorphs support the endosymbiotic theory and are evidence that the plastids containing them are complex plastids. Having two sets of membranes indicate that the plastid, a prokaryote, was engulfed by a eukaryote, an alga, which was then engulfed by another eukaryote, the host cell, making the plastid an example of secondary endosymbiosis. Organisms with known nucleomorphs So far, only two monophyletic groups of organisms are known to contain plastids with a vestigal nucleus or nucleomorph: the cryptomonads of the supergroup Chromista and the chlorarachniophytes of the supergroup Rhizaria, both of which have examples of sequenced nucleomorph genomes. Studies of the genomic organization and of the molecular phylogeny have shown that the nucleomorph of the cryptomonads used to be the nucleus of a red alga, whereas the nucleomorph of the chlorarchniophytes was the nucleus of a green alga. In both groups of organisms the plastids originate from engulfed photoautotrophic eukaryotes. Of the two known plastids that contain nucleomorphs, both have four membranes, the nucleomorph residing in the periplastidial compartment, evidence of being engulfed by a eukaryote through phagocytosis. In addition, some species within the dinoflagellates that have gone through tertiary endosymbiosis also have endosymbionts with both a nucleus and mitochondria present.Tertiary Endosymbiosis in Two Dinotoms Has Generated Little Change in the Mitochondrial Genomes of Their Dinoflagellate Hosts and Diatom Endosymbionts - PLOS Nucleomorph genome Nucleomorphs represent some of the smallest genomes ever sequenced. After the red or green alga was engulfed by a cryptomonad or chlorarachniophyte, respectively, its genome was reduced. The nucleomorph genomes of both cryptomonads and chlorarachniophytes converged upon a similar size from larger genomes. They retained only three chromosomes and many genes were transferred to the nucleus of the host cell, while others were lost entirely. Chlorarachniophytes contain a nucleomorph genome that is diploid and cryptomonads contain a nucleomorph genome that is tetraploid. The unique combination of host cell and complex plastid results in cells with four genomes: two prokaryotic genomes (mitochondrion and plastid of the red or green algae) and two eukaryotic genomes (nucleus of host cell and nucleomorph). The model cryptomonad Guillardia theta became an important focus for scientists studying nucleomorphs. Its complete nucleomorph sequence was published in 2001, coming in at 551 Kbp. The G. theta sequence gave insight as to what genes were retained in nucleomorphs. Most of the genes that moved to the host cell involved protein synthesis, leaving behind a compact genome with mostly single-copy ‚Äúhousekeeping‚Äù genes (affecting transcription, translation, protein folding and degradation and splicing) and no mobile elements. The genome contains 513 genes, 465 of which code for protein. Thirty genes are considered ‚Äúplastid‚Äù genes, coding for plastid proteins. The genome sequence of another organism, the chlorarachniophyte Bigelowiella natans indicates that its nucleomorph is probably the vestigal nucleus of a green alga, whereas the nucleomorph in G. theta probably came from a red alga. The B. natans genome is smaller than that of G. theta, with about 373 Kbp and contains 293 protein- coding genes as compared to the 465 genes in G. theta. B. natans also only has 17 genes that code for plastid proteins, again fewer than G. theta. Comparisons between the two organisms have shown that B. natans contains significantly more introns (852) than G. theta (17). B. natans also had smaller introns, ranging from 18-21 bp, whereas G. theta‚Äôs introns ranged from 42-52 bp. Both the genomes of B. natans and G. theta display evidence of genome reduction besides elimination of genes and tiny size, including elevated composition of adenine (A) and thymine (T), and high substitution rates. Persistence of nucleomorphs There are no recorded instances of vestigial nuclei in any other secondary plastid-containing organisms, yet they have been retained independently in the cryptomonads and chlorarachniophytes. Plastid gene transfer happens frequently in many organisms, and it is unusual that these nucleomorphs have not disappeared entirely. One theory as to why these nucleomorphs have not disappeared as they have in other groups is that introns present in nucleomorphs are not recognized by host spliceosomes because they are too small and therefore cannot be cut and later incorporated into host DNA. Nucleomorphs also often code for many of their own critical functions, like transcription and translation.Curtis, Bruce et al. \\"Algal genomes reveal evolutionary mosaicism and the fate of nucleomorphs.\\" Nature 492 :59-65 Some say that as long as there exists a gene in the nucleomorph that codes for proteins necessary for the plastid‚Äôs functioning that are not produced by the host cell, the nucleomorph will persist. \\\\---- According to GenBank release 164 (Feb 2008), there are 13 Cercozoa and 181 Cryptophyta entries (an entry is the submission of a sequence to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank public database of sequences).

A censored version was published in Moscow magazine in 1966‚Äì1967, after the writer's death. The manuscript was not published as a book until 1967, in Paris. A samizdat version circulated that included parts cut out by official censors, and these were incorporated in a 1969 version published in Frankfurt. The novel has since been published in several languages and editions. The story concerns a visit by the devil to the officially atheistic Soviet Union. The Master and Margarita combines supernatural elements with satirical dark comedy and Christian philosophy, defying categorization within a single genre. Many critics consider it to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, as well as the foremost of Soviet satires.  History  Mikhail Bulgakov was a playwright and author. He started writing the novel in 1928, but burned the first manuscript in 1930 (just as his character The Master did) as he could not see a future as a writer in the Soviet Union at a time of widespread political repression. He restarted the novel in 1931. In the early 1920s, Bulgakov had visited an editorial meeting of an atheistic-propaganda journal. He is believed to have drawn from this to create the Walpurgis Night ball of the novel. He completed his second draft in 1936, by which point he had devised the major plot lines of the final version. He wrote another four versions. When Bulgakov stopped writing four weeks before his death in 1940, the novel had some unfinished sentences and loose ends. A censored version, with about 12 percent of the text removed and more changed, was first published in Moskva magazine (no. 11, 1966 and no. 1, 1967). A manuscript was smuggled out of the Soviet Union to Paris, where the YMCA Press, celebrated for publishing the banned work of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, published the first book edition in 1967. The text, as published in the magazine Moskva in 1968, was swiftly translated into Estonian, remaining for decades the only printed edition of the novel in book form in the Soviet Union. Mihhail Bulgakov, Meister ja Margarita. Tallinn: Kirjastus Eesti Raamat, 1968 The original text of all the omitted and changed parts, with indications of the places of modification, was printed and distributed by hand in the Soviet Union (in the dissident practice known as samizdat). In 1969, the publisher Posev (Frankfurt) printed a version produced with the aid of these inserts. In the Soviet Union, the novel was first published in book form in Estonian in 1968 with some passages edited out. The first complete version, prepared by Anna Sahakyants, was published in Russian by Khudozhestvennaya Literatura in 1973. This was based on Bulgakov's last 1940 version, as proofread by the publisher. This version remained the canonical edition until 1989. The last version, based on all available manuscripts, was prepared by Lidiya Yanovskaya.  Plot  The novel has two settings. The first is Moscow during the 1930s, where Satan appears at Patriarch's Ponds as Professor Woland. He is accompanied by Koroviev, a grotesquely-dressed valet; Behemoth, a black cat; Azazello, a hitman; and Hella, a female vampire. They target the literary elite and Massolit, their trade union,MASSOLIT may be a Soviet-style abbreviation for \\"Moscow Association of Writers\\" (–ú–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è –∞—Å—Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞—Ü–∏—è –ª–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–≤), or \\"Literature for the Masses\\". According to one translation, it may be a play on words in Russian, translatable into English as \\"Lotsalit\\"). whose headquarters is Griboyedov House. Massolit consists of corrupt social climbers and their women, bureaucrats, profiteers, and cynics. The second setting is the Jerusalem of Pontius Pilate: Pilate's trial of Yeshua Ha-Notsri (Jesus of Nazareth), his recognition of an affinity with (and spiritual need for) Yeshua, and his reluctant acquiescence to Yeshua's execution. Part one opens with a confrontation between Berlioz (the head of Massolit) and Woland, who prophesies that Berlioz will die later that evening. Although Berlioz dismisses the prophecy as insane raving, he dies as the professor predicted. His death prophecy is witnessed by Ivan Nikolaevich Ponyrev, a young, enthusiastic, modern poet who uses the pen name Bezdomny (\\"homeless\\"). His nom de plume alludes to Maxim Gorky (Maxim the Bitter), Demyan Bedny (Demyan the Poor), and Michail Golodny (Michail the Hungry). His futile attempts to capture the \\"gang\\" (Woland and his entourage) and his warnings about their evil nature land Ivan in a lunatic asylum, where he is introduced to the Master, an embittered author. The rejection of his novel about Pontius Pilate and Christ led the Master to burn his manuscript in despair and turn his back on Margarita, his devoted lover. The novel's first part includes satirical depictions of Massolit and Griboyedov House; Satan's magic show at a variety theatre, satirizing the vanity, greed, and gullibility of the new elite; and Woland and his retinue appropriating Berlioz's apartment after his death. (Apartmentsscarce in Moscowwere controlled by the state, and Bulgakov based the novel's apartment on his own.) Part two introduces Margarita, the Master's mistress, who refuses to despair of her lover and his work. Azazello gives her a magical skin ointment and invites her to the Devil's midnight Good Friday ball, where Woland gives her the chance to become a witch. Margarita enters the realm of night and learns to fly and control her unleashed passions. Natasha, her maid, accompanies her as they fly over the Soviet Union's deep forests and rivers. Margarita bathes and returns to Moscow with Azazello as the hostess of Satan's spring ball. At Azazello's side, she welcomes dark historical figures as they arrive from Hell. Margarita survives the ordeal, and Satan offers to grant her deepest wish and she asks for another person, she asks to free a woman she met at the ball from eternal punishment. The woman, who had been raped, murdered the child; her punishment was to wake each morning next to the handkerchief she used to smother it. Satan tells Margarita that she liberated the woman, and still has a wish to claim from him. She asks for the Master to be delivered to her and he appears, dazed and thinking he is still in the lunatic asylum. They are returned to the basement apartment which had been their love nest. Matthew Levi delivers the verdict to Woland: the reunited couple will be sent to the afterlife. Azazello brings them a gift from Woland: a bottle of Pontius Pilate's (poisoned) wine. The Master and Margarita die; Azazello brings their souls to Satan and his retinue (awaiting them on horseback on a Moscow rooftop), and they fly away into the unknown, as cupolas and windows burn in the setting sun, leaving Earth behind and traveling into dark cosmic space. The Master and Margarita will spend eternity together in a shady, pleasant region resembling Dante Alighieri's Limbo, in a house under flowering cherry trees. Woland and his retinue, including the Master and Margarita, become pure spirits. Moscow's authorities attribute its strange events to hysteria and mass hypnosis. In the final chapter, Woland tells the Master to finish his novel about Pontius Pilatecondemned by cowardice to limbo for eternity. The Master shouts \\"You are free! He is waiting for you!\\"; Pontius Pilate is freed, walking and talking with the Yeshua whose spirit and philosophy he had secretly admired. Moscow is now peaceful, although some experience great disquiet every May full moon. Ivan Ponyrev becomes a professor of philosophy, but he does not write poetry anymore.  Interpretations  There are several interpretations of the novel: * Response to aggressive atheistic propaganda Some critics suggest that Bulgakov was responding to poets and writers whom he believed were spreading atheist propaganda in the Soviet Union, and denying Jesus Christ as a historical person. He particularly objected to the anti-religious poems of Demyan Bedny. The novel can be seen as a rebuke to the aggressively \\"godless people.\\" There is justification in both the Moscow and Judaea sections of the novel for the entire image of the devil. Bulgakov uses characters from Jewish demonology as a retort to the denial of God in the USSR. Literary critic and Assistant Professor at the Russian State Institute of Performing Arts Nadezhda Dozhdikova notes that the image of Jesus as a harmless madman presented in ‚Ä≥Master and Margarita‚Ä≥ has its source in the literature of the USSR of the 1920s, which, following the tradition of the demythologization of Jesus in the works of Strauss, Renan, Nietzsche and Binet-Sangl√©, put forward two main themes ‚Äì mental illness and deception. The mythological option, namely the denial of the existence of Jesus, only prevailed in the Soviet propaganda at the turn of the 1920s and 1930s. * Occlusive interpretation Bulgakov portrays evil as being as inseparable from our world as light is from darkness. Both Satan and Jesus Christ dwell mostly inside people. Jesus was unable to see Judas' treachery, despite Pilate's hints, because he saw only good in people. He couldn't protect himself, because he didn't know how, nor from whom. This interpretation presumes that Bulgakov had his own vision of Tolstoy's idea of resistance to evil through non-violence, by creating this image of Yeshua. *Freemason interpretation Academics have noted that Bulgakov's novel abounds with symbols derived from Freemasonry. It shows masonic rituals, which this theory suggests originate from the mystery plays of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece. Such writers suggest that Bulgakov had knowledge of Freemasonry.. Bulgakov may have obtained this knowledge from his father, Afanasy Ivanovich Bulgakov, who once wrote an article on \\"Modern Freemasonry and its Relation to the Church and the State\\" in The Acts of the Kiev Theological Academy in 1903.  The Spring Festival Ball at Spaso House  Spaso House On 24 April 1935, Bulgakov was among the invited guests who attended the Spring Festival at Spaso House, the residence of the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, hosted by Ambassador William Bullitt. Critics believe Bulgakov drew from this extravagant event for his novel. In the middle of the Great Depression and Stalinist repression, Bullitt had instructed his staff to create an event that would surpass every other Embassy party in Moscow's history. The decorations included a forest of ten young birch trees in the chandelier room; a dining room table covered with Finnish tulips; a lawn made of chicory grown on wet felt; a fishnet aviary filled with pheasants, parakeets, and one hundred zebra finches, on loan from the Moscow Zoo; and a menagerie including several mountain goats, a dozen white roosters, and a baby bear. Although Joseph Stalin didn't attend, the 400 elite guests at the festival included Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov, Defense Minister Kliment Voroshilov, Communist Party heavyweights Nikolai Bukharin, Lazar Kaganovich, and Karl Radek, Soviet Marshals Aleksandr Yegorov, Mikhail Tukhachevsky, and Semyon Budyonny, and other high-ranking guests. The festival lasted until the early hours of the morning. The bear became drunk on champagne given to him by Karl Radek. In the early morning hours, the zebra finches escaped from the aviary and perched below the ceilings around the house. In his novel, Bulgakov featured the Spring Ball of the Full Moon, considered to be one of the most memorable episodes. On 29 October 2010, seventy-five years after the original ball, John Beyrle, U.S. Ambassador to the Russian Federation, hosted an Enchanted Ball at Spaso House, recreating the spirit of the original ball as a tribute to Ambassador Bullitt and Bulgakov.  Major characters  = Contemporary Russians = ;The Master: An author who wrote a novel about the meeting of Pontius Pilate and Yeshua Ha-Notsri (Jesus of Nazareth), which was rejected by the Soviet literary bureaucracy, ruining his career. He is \\"detained for questioning\\" for three months by the secret police because of a false report by an unscrupulous neighbor. Later, he is committed to a psychiatric clinic, where Bezdomny meets him. Little else is given about this character's past other than his belief that his life began to have meaning when he met Margarita. ;Margarita: The Master's lover. Trapped in a passionless marriage, she devoted herself to the Master, whom she believes to be dead. She appears briefly in the first half of the novel, but is not referred to by name until the second half, when she serves as the hostess of Satan's Grand Ball on Walpurgis Night. Her character is believed to have been inspired by Bulgakov's last wife, whom he called \\"my Margarita\\". He may also have been influenced by Faust's Gretchen, whose full name is Margarita, as well as by Queen Marguerite de Valois. The latter is featured as the main character of the opera Les Huguenots by Giacomo Meyerbeer, which Bulgakov particularly enjoyed, and Alexandre Dumas' novel, La Reine Margot. In these accounts, the queen is portrayed as daring and passionate. ;Mikhail Alexandrovich Berlioz: Head of the literary bureaucracy MASSOLIT. He bears the last name (–ë–µ—Ä–ª–∏–æ–∑) of French composer Hector Berlioz, who wrote the opera The Damnation of Faust. Berlioz insists that the Gospel Jesus was a mythical figure with no historical basis. Woland predicts that he will be decapitated by a young Soviet woman, which comes to pass as he gets run over by a streetcar. ;Ivan Nikolayevich Ponyryov (Bezdomny): A young, aspiring poet. His pen name, Bezdomny (–ò–≤–∞–Ω –ë–µ–∑–¥–æ–º–Ω—ã–π), means \\"homeless\\". Initially a willing tool of the MASSOLIT apparatus, he is transformed by the events of the novel. He witnesses Berlioz's death and nearly goes mad, but later meets The Master in asylum. There he decides to stop writing poetry. ;Stephan Bogdanovich Likhodeyev: Director of the Variety Theatre and Berlioz's roommate, often called by the diminutive name Styopa. His surname is derived from the Russian word for \\"malfeasant\\". For his wicked deeds (he denounced at least five innocent people as spies so that he and Berlioz could grab their multi-bedroom apartment), he is magically teleported to Yalta, thereby freeing up the stolen apartment for Woland and his retinue. ;Grigory Danilovich Rimsky: Treasurer of the Variety Theatre. On the night of Woland's performance, Rimsky is ambushed by Varenukha (who has been turned into a vampire by Woland's gang) and Hella. He barely escapes the encounter and flees to the train station to get out of the city. ;Ivan Savelyevich Varenukha: House-manager of the Variety Theatre, whose surname refers to a traditional alcoholic fruit-punch resembling mulled wine. He is turned into a creature of darkness but is forgiven by the end of Walpurgis Night, restoring his humanity. ;Natasha (Natalia Prokofyevna): Margarita's young maid, later turned into a witch. ;Nikanor Ivanovich Bosoy: Chairman of the House Committee at 302A Sadovaya Street (the former residence of Berlioz). For his greed and trickery, he is deceived by Korovyev and later arrested. = Woland and his entourage = ;Woland: Woland (–í–æ–ª–∞–Ω–¥, also spelled Voland) is Satan in the disguise of a \\"foreign professor\\" who's \\"in Moscow to present a performance of 'black magic' and then expose its machinations\\". Woland instead exposes the greed and bourgeois behaviour of the spectators themselves. Voland is also mentioned in Faust when Mephistopheles announces to the witches to beware because 'Squire Voland is here'. ;Behemoth: An enormous demonic black cat (said to be as big as a hog) who speaks, walks on two legs, and can transform into human shape for brief periods. He has a penchant for chess, vodka, pistols, and obnoxious sarcasm. He is evidently the least-respected member of Woland's team ‚Äì Margarita boldly takes to slapping Behemoth on the head after one of his many ill-timed jokes, without fear of reaction. In the last chapters, it appears that Behemoth is a demon pageboy, the best clown in the world, who paid off his debt by serving Satan on his Moscow journey. His name (–ë–µ–≥–µ–º–æ—Ç) refers to both the Biblical monster and the Russian word for hippopotamus. ;Korovyev: Also known as Fagotto (–§–∞–≥–æ—Ç, meaning \\"bassoon\\" in Russian and other languages), he's described as an \\"ex-choirmaster\\", perhaps implying that he was once a member of an angelic choir. He is Woland's assistant and translator, and is capable of creating any illusion. Unlike Behemoth and Azazello, he doesn't use violence at any point. Like Behemoth, his true form is revealed at the end: a never-smiling dark knight. ;Azazello: Azazello (–ê–∑–∞–∑–µ–ª–ª–æ) is a menacing, fanged, and wall-eyed member of Woland's retinue, a messenger and assassin. His name may be a reference to Azazel, the fallen angel who taught people to make weapons and jewelry, and taught women the \\"sinful art\\" of painting their faces (mentioned in the apocryphal Book of Enoch 8:1‚Äì3). He gives a magical cream to Margarita. He transforms into his real shape in the end: a pale-faced demon with black empty eyes. ;Hella: Hella (–ì–µ–ª–ª–∞) is a beautiful, redheaded succubus. She serves as maid to Woland and his retinue. She is described as being \\"perfect, were it not for a purple scar on her neck\\", suggesting that she is also a vampire. = Characters from The Master's novel = ; Pontius Pilate: The Roman Procurator of Judaea (a governor of a small province). The historical Pontius Pilate was the Prefect of Judaea, not the procurator. This fact was not widely known until after Bulgakov's death. ; Yeshua Ha-Notsri: Jesus the Nazarene (–ò–µ—à—É–∞ –≥–∞-–ù–æ—Ü—Ä–∏), a wanderer or \\"mad philosopher\\", as Pilate calls him. His name in Hebrew is said to mean either \\"Jesus who belongs to the Nazarene sect\\" or \\"Jesus who is from a place called Nazareth\\", though some commentators dispute the latter interpretation. In the Master's version, Yeshua describes himself as an orphan (he says \\"some say that my father was a syrian), calls everybody (even a torturer) \\"kind man\\", denies doing miracles, and has one full-time \\"Apostle\\", not twelve, among other departures from the Gospels and mainstream Christian tradition. The atheist regime of the novel still considers this Jesus to be offensive. ; Aphranius: Head of the Roman Secret Service in Judaea. ; Niza: Aphranius's henchwoman, who entices Judas to his death. ; Levi Matvei: Levite, former tax collector, follower of Yeshua. Levi is introduced as a semi- fictionalized character in the Master's novel, but toward the end of The Master and Margarita, the \\"historical\\" Matthew of the Gospel appears in Moscow to deliver a message from Yeshua to Woland. ; Caiaphas: Politically savvy High Priest of Judaea. Caiaphas supports execution of Yeshua in order to \\"protect\\" the status quo ante religion, and his own status as the Chief of the Sanhedrin, from the influence of Yeshua's preachings and followers. He is considerably more aggressive towards Pilate than most accounts, and seems unconcerned by the other man's senior status. ; Judas Iscariot: A spy/informant hired by Caiaphas to assist the authorities in finding and arresting Yeshua. In contrast to the Gospels' version, in which Judas is a long-time member of Jesus's \\"inner circle\\" of Apostles, Bulgakov's Judas (of Karioth) meets Yeshua for the first time less than 48 hours before betraying him. He is paid off by Caiaphas, but is later assassinated on Pilate's orders for his role in Yeshua's death.  Themes and imagery  The novel deals with the interplay of good and evil, innocence and guilt, courage and cowardice, exploring such issues as the responsibility towards truth when authority would deny it, and freedom of the spirit in an unfree world. Love and sensuality are also dominant themes in the novel. Margarita's devotional love for the Master leads her to leave her husband, but she emerges victorious. Her spiritual union with the Master is also a sexual one. The novel is a riot of sensual impressions, but the emptiness of sensual gratification without love is emphasized in the satirical passages. Rejecting sensuality for the sake of empty respectability is pilloried in the figure of Nikolai Ivanovich, who becomes Natasha's hog-broomstick. The interplay of fire, water, destruction, and other natural forces provides a constant accompaniment to the events of the novel, as do light and darkness, noise and silence, sun and moon, storms and tranquility, and other powerful polarities. There is a complex relationship between Jerusalem and Moscow throughout the novel, sometimes polyphony, sometimes counterpoint. The novel is deeply influenced by Goethe's Faust, and its themes of cowardice, trust, intellectual curiosity, and redemption are prominent. It can be read on many different levels, as hilarious slapstick, deep philosophical allegory, and biting socio-political satire critical of not just the Soviet system but also the superficiality and vanity of modern life in general.*Chris Hedges, \\"Welcome to Satan's Ball\\", Truthdig, 10 March 2014; A comparison of the Soviet society described in Master and Margarita and modern society in the United States and Russia. Jazz is presented with an ambivalent fascination and revulsion. But the novel is full of modern elements, such as the model asylum, radio, street and shopping lights, cars, lorries, trams, and air travel. There is little evident nostalgia for any \\"good old days\\" ‚Äì the only figure who mentions Tsarist Russia is Satan. The book is a Bildungsroman, with Ivan Nikolayevich as its focus. It also has strong elements of what in the later 20th century was called magic realism.  Allusions and references to other works  The novel is influenced by the Faust legend, particularly the first part of the Goethe interpretation, The Devil's Pact, which goes back to the 4th century; Christopher Marlowe's Dr Faustus (where in the last act the hero cannot burn his manuscript or receive forgiveness from a loving God); and the libretto of the opera whose music was composed by Charles Gounod. Also of influence is Louis Hector Berlioz who wrote the opera La damnation de Faust. In this opera there are four characters: Faust (tenor), the devil M√©phistoph√©l√®s (baritone), Marguerite (mezzosoprano) and Brander (bass). And also the Symphonie Fantastique where the hero dreams of his own decapitation and attending a witches' sabbath. Nikolai Gogol is seen as an influence, as is the case in other Bulgakov novels. The dialogue between Pontius Pilate and Yeshua Ha- Notsri is strongly influenced by Fyodor Dostoyevsky's parable \\"The Grand Inquisitor\\" from The Brothers Karamazov. The \\"luckless visitors chapter\\" refers to Tolstoy's Anna Karenina: \\"everything became jumbled in the Oblonsky household\\". The theme of the Devil exposing society as an apartment block, as it could be seen if the entire fa√ßade would be removed, has some precedents in El diablo cojuelo (1641, The Lame Devil or The Crippled Devil) by the Spaniard Lu√≠s V√©lez de Guevara. (This was adapted to 18th-century France by Alain-Ren√© Lesage's 1707 Le Diable boiteux.)  English translations  The novel has been translated several times into English: * Mirra Ginsburg's 1967 version for Grove Press * Michael Glenny's November 1967 version for Harper and Row and Harvill Press * Diana Burgin and Katherine Tiernan O'Connor's 1993 version for Ardis Publishing * Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky's 1997 version for Penguin Books * Michael Karpelson's 2006 version for Lulu Press and Wordsworth; republished 2011 by Wordsworth Editions, Ware, Hertfordshire, . * Hugh Aplin's 2008 version for Oneworld Publications * John Dougherty's 2017 version for Russian Tumble * Sergei Khramtsov-Templar's 2000 version (non- published, catalogued with the Library of Congress) The early translation by Glenny runs more smoothly than that of the modern translations; some Russian- speaking readers consider it to be the only one creating the desired effect, though it may take liberties with the text. The modern translators pay for their attempted closeness by losing idiomatic flow. Literary writer Kevin Moss considers the early translations by Ginsburg and Glenny to be hurried, and lacking much critical depth. As an example, he claims that the more idiomatic translations miss Bulgakov's \\"crucial\\" reference to the devil in Berlioz's thoughts (original: \\"–ü–æ–∂–∞–ª—É–π, –ø–æ—Ä–∞ –±—Ä–æ—Å–∏—Ç—å –≤—Å–µ –∫ —á–µ—Ä—Ç—É –∏ –≤ –ö–∏—Å–ª–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å–∫‚Ä¶\\"–ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª –ë—É–ª–≥–∞–∫–æ–≤, –ú–∞—Å—Ç–µ—Ä –∏ –ú–∞—Ä–≥–∞—Ä–∏—Ç–∞. –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞: –≠–ö–°–ú–û, 2003, p. 10): * \\"I ought to drop everything and run down to Kislovodsk.\\" (Ginsburg) * \\"I think it's time to chuck everything up and go and take the waters at Kislovodsk.\\" (Glenny) * \\"It's time to throw everything to the devil and go off to Kislovodsk.\\" (Burgin and Tiernan O'Connor) * \\"It's time to send it all to the devil and go to Kislovodsk.\\" (Pevear and Volokhonsky) * \\"To hell with everything, it's time to take that Kislovodsk vacation.\\" (Karpelson) * \\"It's time to let everything go to the devil and be off to Kislovodsk.\\" (Aplin) Several literary critics have hailed the Burgin/Tiernan O‚ÄôConnor translation as the most accurate and complete English translation, particularly when read in tandem with the matching annotations by Bulgakov's biographer, Ellendea Proffer. However, these judgements predate translations by Pevear & Volokhonsky, Karpelson, and Aplin. The Karpelson translation, even when republished in the UK by Wordsworth, has not been Anglicised, and retains North American spellings and idioms.  Cultural influence  The book was listed in Le Mondes 100 Books of the Century. Also, when asked by Tyler Cowen, \\"What‚Äôs your favorite novel?\\" the technologist Peter Thiel answered, \\"If you want something a little more intellectual, it‚Äôs probably the Bulgakov novel The Master and Margarita where the devil shows up in Stalinist Russia, and succeeds, and gives everybody what they want, and everything goes haywire. It‚Äôs hard, because no one believes he‚Äôs real.\\" In the times of state atheism in the USSR many people could not read the Gospels and they imagined Jesus as Jeshua from Bulgakov's novel. = \\"Manuscripts don't burn\\" = A memorable and much-quoted line in The Master and Margarita is: \\"manuscripts don't burn\\" (). The Master is a writer who is plagued both by his own mental problems and the harsh political criticism faced by most Soviet writers in 1930s Moscow in the Stalinist Soviet Union. He burns his treasured manuscript in an effort to cleanse his mind from the troubles the work has brought him. When they finally meet, Woland asks to see the Master's novel; the Master apologizes for not being able to do so, as he had burnt it. Woland to him saying, \\"You can't have done. Manuscripts don't burn.\\" There is a deeply autobiographical element reflected in this passage. Bulgakov burned an early copy of The Master and Margarita for much the same reasons as he expresses in the novel. Also this may refer to Christopher Marlowe's Dr. Faustus where the hero, deviating from previous tales of 'The Devil's Pact', is unable to burn his books or repent to a merciful God. = Bulgakov museums in Moscow = In Moscow, two museums honor the memory of Mikhail Bulgakov and The Master and Margarita. Both are located in Bulgakov's former apartment building on Bolshaya Sadovaya Street, No. 10. Since the late 1980s and the fall of the Soviet Union, the building has become a gathering spot for Bulgakov fans, as well as Moscow-based Satanist groups. Over the years they have filled the walls with graffiti. The best drawings were usually kept as the walls were repainted, so that several layers of different colored paints could be seen around them. In 2003, all of the numerous paintings, quips, and drawings were completely whitewashed.. The two museums are rivals: the official Museum M.A. Bulgakov, although established second, identifies as \\"the first and only Memorial Museum of Mikhail Bulgakov in Moscow\\". * Bulgakov House The Bulgakov House () is situated on the ground floor of the building. This museum was established as a private initiative on 15 May 2004. It contains personal belongings, photos, and several exhibitions related to Bulgakov's life and his different works. Various poetic and literary events are often held. The museum organises tours of Bulgakov's Moscow, some of which have re-enactors playing characters of The Master and Margarita. The Bulgakov House also operates the Theatre M.A. Bulgakov and the Caf√© 302-bis. * Museum M.A. Bulgakov In apartment number 50 on the fourth floor is the Museum M.A. Bulgakov (. –ê. –ë—É–ª–≥–∞–∫–æ–≤). This facility is a government initiative, founded on 26 March 2007. It contains personal belongings, photos, and several exhibitions related to Bulgakov's life and his different works. Various poetic and literary events are often held here. = Allusions and references = Various authors and musicians have credited The Master and Margarita as inspiration for certain works. * British singer Mick Jagger was inspired by the novel in writing the song \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\".. Will Self's foreword to the Vintage edition of the Michael Glenny translation of the novel suggests the same, and Jagger's then girlfriend Marianne Faithfull confirmed it in an interview with Sylvie Simmons from the magazine Mojo in 2005. Jagger says so himself in the Stones biodoc Crossfire Hurricane. * The grunge band Pearl Jam were influenced by the novel's confrontation between Yeshua Ha-Nozri and Pontius Pilate in their song, \\"Pilate\\", on their 1998 album Yield.. * The Canadian band The Tea Party has a song named The Master and Margarita.https://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107858693537/ * Surrealist artist H. R. Giger named a 1976 painting after the novel. The band Danzig featured this painting on the cover of their 1992 album Danzig III: How the Gods Kill. * The title song on Patti Smith's album Banga refers to Pontius Pilate and his dog Banga as portrayed in The Master and Margarita. * MASTER MARGHERITA - musical band from Switzerland. * Russian writers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky were heavily influenced by this novel when writing several of their books. –êmong them are such works as Snail on the Slope, Limping Fate, Overburdened with Evil and others.

During the Sengoku period, the area was controlled by the Oda clan and subsequently in the Edo period was part of the holdings of the Owari-Tokugawa family of Owari Domain. During the Meiji period, the area was organized into several villages under Ama District, Aichi Prefecture, including the village of Tsushima in 1871 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. During the Meiji period, the area was a center for textile production. Tsushima was elevated to town status on October 1, 1889, and to city status on March 1, 1947.

It is possible that Tsushima was recognized as a province of the Yamato Court in the 5th century. Under the Ritsury≈ç system, Tsushima formally became a province. Tsushima Province has been a strategic area that took a major role in the national defense against possible invasions from the continent and in trade with Korea. After Japan was defeated by Tang dynasty at the Battle of Baekgang in 663, Kaneda Castle was constructed on this island. Tsushima Province had been controlled by the Tsushima no Kuni no miyatsuko until the Heian period. This clan was later replaced by the Abiru clan. The S≈ç clan rose to power around the middle 13th century and seized control of the entire island in the late 15th century. During the Edo period, Tsushima Province was dominated by the Tsushima-Fuch≈´ Domain (Izuhara domain) of the So clan. It was put in charge of diplomacy and monopolized trade with the Joseon dynasty of Korea. As a result of the abolition of the han system, the Tsushima Fuchu domain became Izuhara Prefecture in 1871. In the same year, Izuhara Prefecture was merged into Imari Prefecture, which was renamed Saga Prefecture in 1872. Tsushima was transferred to Nagasaki Prefecture in 1872. At the same time, the province continued to exist for some purposes. For example, Tsushima is explicitly recognized in treaties in 1894 (a) between Japan and the United States and (b) between Japan and the United Kingdom.US Department of State. (1906).

Historical districts Throughout history, Tsushima Province consisted of two districts: * Nagasaki Prefecture ** Kamiagata District (‰∏äÁúåÈÉ°) ** Shimoagata District (‰∏ãÁúåÈÉ°) The capital of Tsushima Province was located at Izuhara. In the modern local municipality system, they were divided into Kamiagata and Shimoagata Districts respectively, and were subsequently merged into the city of Tsushima today.

Human Rights, Hodder Arnold, London, 2005, pp. 18‚Äì20 The right to freedom of association is recognized as a human right, a political right and a civil liberty. The terms freedom of assembly and freedom of association may be used to distinguish between the freedom to assemble in public places and the freedom to join an association. Freedom of assembly is often used in the context of the right to protest, while freedom of association is used in the context of labor rights and in the Constitution of the United States is interpreted to mean both the freedom to assemble and the freedom to join an association.See: NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 898 (1982); Healey v. James, 408 U.S. 169 (1972); Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Virginia, 377 U.S. 1 (1964); United Mine Workers v. Illinois State Bar Assn., 389 U.S. 217 (1967). In American history, freedom of assembly has protected individuals espousing variety of different viewpoints. Striking workers, civil rights advocates, anti-war demonstrators and Ku Klux Klan marchers have all taken to the streets and sidewalks in protest or in support of their causes. Sometimes these efforts have galvanized public support or changed public perceptions.

Although some of the theorems for ultrametric spaces may seem strange at a first glance, they appear naturally in many applications.  Formal definition  An ultrametric on a set is a real-valued function :d\\\\colon M \\\\times M \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} (where denote the real numbers), such that for all : # ; # (symmetry) # ; # if then (Identity of indiscernibles); # } (strong triangle or ultrametric inequality). :Definition: An ultrametric space is a pair consisting of a set together with an ultrametric on , which is called the space's associated distance function (also called a metric). :Definition: If satisfies all of the conditions except possibly condition 4 (i.e. identity of indiscernibles), then is called an ultrapseudometric on . An ultrapseudometric space is a pair consisting of a set and an ultrapseudometric on . In the case when is a group (written additively) and is generated by a length function \\\\\\\\cdot\\\\ (so that d(x,y) = \\\\x - y\\\\), the last property can be made stronger using the Krull sharpeningPlanet Math: Ultrametric Triangle Inequality to: : \\\\x+y\\\\\\\\le \\\\max \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\x\\\\, \\\\y\\\\ \\\\right\\\\\\\\} with equality if \\\\x\\\\ e \\\\y\\\\. We want to prove that if \\\\x+y\\\\ \\\\le \\\\max \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\x\\\\, \\\\y\\\\\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, then the equality occurs if \\\\x\\\\ e \\\\y\\\\. Without loss of generality, let us assume that \\\\x\\\\ > \\\\y\\\\. This implies that \\\\x + y\\\\ \\\\le \\\\x\\\\. But we can also compute \\\\x\\\\=\\\\(x+y)-y\\\\ \\\\le \\\\max \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\x+y\\\\, \\\\y\\\\\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Now, the value of \\\\max \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\x+y\\\\, \\\\y\\\\\\\\right\\\\\\\\} cannot be \\\\y\\\\, for if that is the case, we have \\\\x\\\\ \\\\le \\\\y\\\\ contrary to the initial assumption. Thus, \\\\max \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\x+y\\\\, \\\\y\\\\\\\\right\\\\\\\\}=\\\\x+y\\\\, and \\\\x\\\\ \\\\le \\\\x+y\\\\. Using the initial inequality, we have \\\\x\\\\ \\\\le \\\\x + y\\\\ \\\\le \\\\x\\\\ and therefore \\\\x+y\\\\ = \\\\x\\\\. Properties In the triangle on the right, the two bottom points x and y violate the condition d(x, y) ‚â§ max(d(x, z), d(y, z)). From the above definition, one can conclude several typical properties of ultrametrics. For example, for all x,y,z \\\\in M, at least one of the three equalities d(x,y) = d(y,z) or d(x,z) = d(y,z) or d(x,y) = d(z,x) holds. That is, every triple of points in the space forms an isosceles triangle, so the whole space is an isosceles set. Defining the (open) ball of radius r > 0 centred at x \\\\in M as B(x;r) := \\\\\\\\{y \\\\in M \\\\mid d(x,y) < r\\\\\\\\}, we have the following properties: * Every point inside a ball is its center, i.e. if d(x,y) then B(x;r)=B(y;r). * Intersecting balls are contained in each other, i.e. if B(x;r)\\\\cap B(y;s) is non-empty then either B(x;r) \\\\subseteq B(y;s) or B(y;s) \\\\subseteq B(x;r). * All balls of strictly positive radius are both open and closed sets in the induced topology. That is, open balls are also closed, and closed balls (replace < with \\\\leq) are also open. * The set of all open balls with radius r and center in a closed ball of radius r>0 forms a partition of the latter, and the mutual distance of two distinct open balls is (greater or) equal to r. Proving these statements is an instructive exercise. All directly derive from the ultrametric triangle inequality. Note that, by the second statement, a ball may have several center points that have non-zero distance. The intuition behind such seemingly strange effects is that, due to the strong triangle inequality, distances in ultrametrics do not add up.  Examples  * The discrete metric is an ultrametric. * The p-adic numbers form a complete ultrametric space. * Consider the set of words of arbitrary length (finite or infinite), Œ£*, over some alphabet Œ£. Define the distance between two different words to be 2‚àín, where n is the first place at which the words differ. The resulting metric is an ultrametric. * The set of words with glued ends of the length n over some alphabet Œ£ is an ultrametric space with respect to the p-close distance. Two words x and y are p-close if any substring of p consecutive letters (p < n) appears the same number of times (which could also be zero) both in x and y.. * If r = (rn) is a sequence of real numbers decreasing to zero, then xr := lim supn‚Üí‚àû xnrn induces an ultrametric on the space of all complex sequences for which it is finite. (Note that this is not a seminorm since it lacks homogeneity -- If the rn are allowed to be zero, one should use here the rather unusual convention that 00=0.) * If G is an edge-weighted undirected graph, all edge weights are positive, and d(u,v) is the weight of the minimax path between u and v (that is, the largest weight of an edge, on a path chosen to minimize this largest weight), then the vertices of the graph, with distance measured by d, form an ultrametric space, and all finite ultrametric spaces may be represented in this way..  Applications * A contraction mapping may then be thought of as a way of approximating the final result of a computation (which can be guaranteed to exist by the Banach fixed point theorem). Similar ideas can be found in domain theory. p-adic analysis makes heavy use of the ultrametric nature of the p-adic metric. * In condensed matter physics, the self-averaging overlap between spins in the SK Model of spin glasses exhibits an ultrametric structure, with the solution given by the full replica symmetry breaking procedure first outlined by Giorgio Parisi and coworkers.Mezard, M; Parisi, G; and Virasoro, M: SPIN GLASS THEORY AND BEYOND, World Scientific, 1986. Ultrametricity also appears in the theory of aperiodic solids. * In taxonomy and phylogenetic tree construction, ultrametric distances are also utilized by the UPGMA and WPGMA methods.Legendre, P. and Legendre, L. 1998. Numerical Ecology. Second English Edition. Developments in Environmental Modelling 20. Elsevier, Amsterdam. These algorithms require a constant-rate assumption and produce trees in which the distances from the root to every branch tip are equal. When DNA, RNA and protein data are analyzed, the ultrametricity assumption is called the molecular clock. * Models of intermittency in three dimensional turbulence of fluids make use of so-called cascades, and in discrete models of dyadic cascades, which have an ultrametric structure. * In geography and landscape ecology, ultrametric distances have been applied to measure landscape complexity and to assess the extent to which one landscape function is more important than another.

Formed in 1903 by the merger of The Team Drivers International Union and The Teamsters National Union, the union now represents a diverse membership of blue-collar and professional workers in both the public and private sectors. The union has approximately 2.5 million members as of 2020. Formerly known as the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, the IBT is a member of the Change to Win Federation and Canadian Labour Congress. History =Early history= Cornelius Shea, first General President of the Teamsters, circa 1905 The American Federation of Labor (AFL) had helped form local unions of teamsters since 1887. In November 1898, the AFL organized the Team Drivers' International Union (TDIU).Sloane, Hoffa, 1991.Taft, The A.F. of L. in the Time of Gompers, 1957. In 1901, a group of teamsters in Chicago, Illinois, broke from the TDIU and formed the Teamsters National Union. Unlike the TDIU, which permitted large employers to be members, the new Teamsters National Union permitted only employees, teamster helpers, and owner-operators owning only a single team to join, and advocated higher wages and shorter hours more aggressively than the TDIU. Claiming more than 28,000 members in 47 locals, its president, Albert Young, applied for membership in the AFL. The AFL asked the TDIU to merge with Young's union to form a new, AFL-affiliated union and the two groups did so in 1903, forming the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), and electing Cornelius Shea as the new union's first president. The election process proved tumultuous. Shea effectively controlled the convention because the Chicago locals‚Äîrepresenting nearly half the IBT's membership Montgomery, The Fall of the House of Labor: The Workplace, the State, and American Labor Activism, 1865-1925, 1987. ‚Äîsupported his candidacy en bloc. Shea was opposed by John Sheridan, president of the Ice Drivers' Union of Chicago. Sheridan and George Innes, president of the TDIU, accused Shea of embezzlement in an attempt to prevent his election. Sheridan and Innes alleged that Shea had billed locals in Massachusetts $9.61 for services while charging the national union $19.44 for the same services. \\"Drivers Bolt Meeting,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, August 9, 1903. Shea won the election on August 8, 1903, by a vote of 605 to 480. The new grouping elected Edward L. Turley of Chicago as secretary-treasurer and Albert Young as general organizer. \\"Drivers Bolt Meeting,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, August 9, 1903.\\"Shea Chosen,\\" Boston Daily Globe, August 9, 1903. The union, like most unions within the American Federation of Labor (AFL) at the time, had a largely decentralized structure, with a number of local unions that governed themselves autonomously and tended to look only after their own interests in the geographical jurisdiction in which they operated. Galenson, The CIO Challenge to the AFL: A History of the American Labor Movement, 1960. Bernstein, The Lean Years: A History of the American Worker, 1920-1933, 1972. The teamsters were vitally important to the labor movement, for a strike or sympathy strike by the teamsters could paralyze the movement of goods throughout a city and bring a strike into nearly every neighborhood. It also meant that teamsters leaders were able to demand bribes in order to avoid strikes, and control of a teamsters local could bring organized crime significant revenues. During Shea's presidency, the entire teamsters union was notoriously corrupt. Fitch, Solidarity for Sale, 2006. Witwer, \\"Unionized Teamsters and the Struggle over the Streets of the Early-Twentieth-Century City,\\" Social Science History, Spring 2000. Tilman, \\"John R.

Shea, John Miller, Fred Mader, and Tim Murphy sitting in a row in a courtroom in Chicago, Illinois, during a labor trial. Murphy was a politician, union organizer, and reputed gangster, and he was murdered in 1928. Several major strikes occupied the union in its first three years. In November 1903, teamsters employed by the Chicago City Railway went out on strike. Shea attempted to stop sympathy strikes by other teamster locals, but three locals walked out and eventually disaffiliated over the sympathy-strike issue. \\"Teamsters Are For War,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, November 23, 1903; \\"Teamsters Split Over Contracts,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, November 25, 1903; \\"Labor's Leader Made to Dance,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, December 18, 1903. A sympathy strike in support of 18,000 striking meat cutters in Chicago in July 1904 led to riots before the extensive use of strikebreakers led Shea to force his members back to work (leading to the collapse of the meat cutters' strike).

In the midst of the strife in 1904, the teamsters convention in Cincinnati, Ohio re-elected Shea by acclamation on August 8, 1904. Under his leadership, the union had expanded to nearly 50,000 members in 821 locals in 300 cities, making the Teamsters one of the largest unions in the United States. In 1905 10,000 teamsters struck in support of locked-out tailors at Montgomery Ward, and eventually more than 25,000 teamsters manned the picket lines.Cohen, The Racketeer's Progress: Chicago and the Struggle for the Modern American Economy, 1900-1940, 2004. \\"Gigantic Strike Is In Full Swing,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, April 28, 1905; \\"Big Strike Has Small Beginning,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, May 20, 1905; \\"To Test Union Sympathy,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, April 6, 1905. \\"History of Great Teamsters' Strike Filled with Sensational Incidents,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, July 21, 1905. But when local newspapers discovered that Shea was living in a local brothel, kept a 19-year-old waitress as a mistress, and had spent the strike hosting parties, public support for the strike collapsed and the strike ended on August 1, 1905. \\"Women Betray Labor Leaders,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, June 12, 1905.

However, during the 1906 re-election Shea had promised that he would resign the presidency once his trial had ended.\\"Shea's Scepter About to Fall?\\", Chicago Daily Tribune, March 22, 1907. But he did not, and most union members withdrew their support for him. Daniel J. Tobin of Boston was elected Shea's successor by a vote of 104 to 94 in August 1907.\\"Shea Beaten By 10 Votes,\\" Boston Daily Globe, August 10, 1907. =Organizing and growth during the Great Depression= Tobin was president of the Teamsters from 1907 to 1952. Although he faced opposition in his re- election races in 1908, 1909 and 1910, he never faced opposition again until his retirement in 1952.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: The Policies and Practices of the American Federation of Labor, 1900-1909, 1964. The Teamsters began to expand dramatically and mature organizationally under Tobin. He pushed for the development of \\"joint councils\\" to which all local unions were forced to affiliate. Varying in geographical and industrial jurisdiction, the joint councils became important incubators for up-and-coming leadership and negotiating master agreements which covered all employers in a given industry. Tobin also actively discouraged strikes in order to bring discipline to the union and encourage employers to sign contracts, and founded and edited the union magazine, the International Teamster.Fink, Biographical Dictionary of American Labor, 1984.Phelan, William Green: Biography of a Labor Leader, 1989. Under Tobin, the Teamsters also first developed the \\"regional conference\\" system (developed by Dave Beck in Seattle), which provided stability, organizing strength, and leadership to the international union. Tobin undertook long jurisdictional battles with many unions during this period. Fierce disputes occurred between the Teamsters and the Gasoline State Operators' National Council (an AFL federal union of gas station attendants), the International Longshoremen's Association, the Retail Clerks International Union, and the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks.Bernstein, The Turbulent Years: A History of the American Worker, 1933-1941, 1970. The most significant disagreement, however, was with the United Brewery Workers over the right to represent beer wagon drivers. While the Teamsters lost this battle in 1913, when the AFL awarded jurisdiction to the Brewers, they won when the issue came before the AFL Executive Board again in 1933, when the Brewers were still recovering from their near-elimination during Prohibition.Taft, The A.F. of L. From the Death of Gompers to the Merger, 1959.\\"Craft Unionists Win in Federation,\\" The New York Times, October 11, 1933. The raids and new member organizing in the 1930s led to significant membership increases. Teamster membership stood at just 82,000 in 1932. Tobin took advantage of the wave of pro-union sentiment engendered by the passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act, and by 1935 union membership had increased nearly 65 percent to 135,000. By 1941, Tobin had a dues-paying membership of 530,000‚Äîmaking the Teamsters the fastest- growing labor union in the United States. One of the most significant events in union history occurred in 1934. A group of radicals in Local 574 in Minneapolis‚Äîled by Farrell Dobbs, Carl Skoglund, and the Dunne brothers (Ray, Miles and Grant), all members of the Trotskyist Communist League of America‚Äîbegan successfully organizing coal truck drivers in the winter of 1933.Korth, Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934, 1995. Tobin, an ardent anti- communist,Dubofsky and Van Tine, John L. Lewis: A Biography, 1992. opposed their efforts and refused to support their 1933 strike. Local 574 struck again in 1934, leading to several riots over a nine-day period in May. When the employers' association reneged on the agreement, Local 574 resumed the strike, although it ended again after nine days when martial law was declared by Governor Floyd B. Olson. Although Local 574 won a contract recognizing the union and which broke the back of the anti-union Citizens Alliance in Minneapolis, Tobin expelled Local 574 from the Teamsters. Member outrage was extensive, and in August 1936 he was forced to recharter the local as 544.Schlesinger, The Age of Roosevelt: The Coming of the New Deal, 1933-1935, 1959. Within a year the newly formed Local 544 had organized 250,000 truckers in the Midwest and formed the Central Conference of Teamsters. Extensive organizing also occurred in the West. Harry Bridges, radical leader of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (ILWU), was leading \\"the march inland\\"‚Äîan attempt to organize warehouse workers away from shipping ports.Nelson, Workers on the Waterfront: Seamen, Longshoremen and Unionism in the 1930s, 1988. Alarmed by Bridges' radical politics and worried that the ILWU would encroach on Teamster jurisdictions, Dave Beck formed a large regional organization (the Western Conference of Teamsters) to engage in fierce organizing battles and membership raids against the ILWU which led to the establishment of many new locals and the organization of tens of thousands of new members.Garnel, The Rise of Teamster Power in the West, 1972. But corruption became even more widespread in the Teamsters during the Tobin administration. By 1941, the union was considered the most corrupt in the United States, and the most abusive towards its own members. Tobin vigorously defended the union against such accusations, but also instituted many constitutional and organizational changes and practices which made it easier for union officials to engage in criminal offenses.Galenson claims that Tobin's \\"personal honesty was never challenged...\\" See: Galenson, The CIO Challenge to the AFL: A History of the American Labor Movement, 1960, p. 471. Other historians challenge this conclusion, but conclude any misdeeds Tobin engaged in are minor compared to those of some Teamsters leaders. See: Garnel, The Rise of Teamster Power in the West, 1972; Witwer, Corruption and Reform in the Teamsters Union, 2003; Phelan, William Green: Biography of a Labor Leader, 1989. =World War II and the post-war period= By the beginning of World War II, the Teamsters was one of the most powerful unions in the country, and Teamster leaders were influential in the corridors of power. Union membership had risen more than 390 percent between 1935 and 1941 to 530,000. In June 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed IBT President Daniel J. Tobin to be the official White House liaison to organized labor, and later that year chair of the Labor Division of the Democratic National Committee.Stark, \\"White House Link to Conciliate A.F.L.,\\" The New York Times, June 11, 1940; \\"Tobin, to Aid Flynn, Quits White House,\\" The New York Times, August 27, 1940. In 1942, President Roosevelt appointed Tobin special representative to the United Kingdom and charged him with investigating the state of the labor movement there.\\"English Labor in War Described By Tobin,\\" The New York Times, September 27, 1942. Tobin was considered three times for Secretary of Labor, and twice refused the post‚Äîin 1943 and 1947.Stark, \\"Successor Sought for Miss Perkins,\\" The New York Times, December 11, 1944; \\"Tobin Endorsed for Labor Post,\\" The New York Times, January 18, 1945; Hulen, \\"Successors Named,\\" The New York Times, May 24, 1945; \\"Dan Tobin Refused 2 Cabinet Offers,\\" The New York Times, August 12, 1948. On September 23, 1944, Roosevelt gave his famous \\"Fala speech\\" while campaigning in the 1944 presidential election. Because of Roosevelt's strong relationship with Tobin and the union's large membership, the President delivered his speech before the Teamster convention. Nonetheless, Teamsters members were restive. Dissident members of the union accused the leadership of suppressing democracy in the union, a charge President Tobin angrily denied.Stark, \\"Dictatorship Issue Stirs Teamsters,\\" The New York Times, September 14, 1940. Over the next year, Tobin cracked down on dissidents and trusted several large locals led by his political opponents.\\"Teamsters Order 2d Ouster in Jersey,\\" Associated Press, March 12, 1941; \\"Seceding Drivers Face Union Strife,\\" The New York Times, June 11, 1941. During World War II, The Teamsters strongly endorsed the American labor movement's no-strike pledge. The Teamsters agreed to cease raiding other unions and not strike for the duration of the national emergency. President Tobin even ordered Teamsters members to cross picket lines put up by other unions. Nevertheless, the national leadership sanctioned strikes by Midwestern truckers in August 1942, Southern truckers in October 1943, and brewery workers and milk delivery drivers in January 1945.\\"President Summons 'Labor War Board',\\" The New York Times, February 5, 1942; \\"President Meets Joint Labor Group,\\" The New York Times, February 7, 1942; \\"WLB Demands End of Trucking Strike,\\" The New York Times, August 25, 1942; \\"Tobin Demands Unions Punish Strikers,\\" The New York Times, March 6, 1943; \\"Tobin Bids Public Insist Work Go On,\\" The New York Times, June 7, 1943; \\"Truck Tie-Up Halts Freight in South,\\" Associated Press, October 11, 1943; \\"3 Breweries Face Seizure In Strike,\\" The New York Times, January 14, 1945; \\"Deliveries Halted on Certified Milk,\\" The New York Times, January 15, 1945; \\"Tobin Tells Union to Ignore Pickets,\\" Associated Press, May 31, 1945. The Teamsters did not, however, participate in the great post-war wave of labor strikes. In the two years following the cessation of hostilities, the Teamsters struck only three times: 10,000 truckers in New Jersey struck for two weeks; workers at UPS struck nationwide for three weeks; and workers at Railway Express Agency struck for almost a month.Raskin, \\"Union Vote Today,\\" The New York Times, September 12, 1946; Raskin, \\"Situation Is Eased,\\" The New York Times, September 13, 1946; Lissner, \\"Tobin Bids Union End Parcel Strike,\\" The New York Times, September 19, 1946; Raskin, \\"Express Strikers Picket Airfield,\\" The New York Times, October 10, 1947; \\"Union Head Scores Express Walkout,\\" The New York Times, October 13, 1947; \\"Tobin Warns Union On Wage Demands,\\" The New York Times, June 4, 1948. Teamsters leaders strongly opposed enactment of the Taft-Hartley Act and repeatedly called for its repeal. President Tobin, however, was one of the first labor leaders to sign the non-communist affidavit required by the law.Signing the affidavit provided the Teamsters with the protection of the NLRA, which was an important tool in the Teamsters' fight with the Brewery Workers. \\"Tobin Opposes Law On Labor Disputes,\\" The New York Times, January 19, 1947; \\"Tobin Signs Affidavit,\\" The New York Times, September 16, 1947; Davies, \\"Tobin Again Heads Teamsters' Union,\\" The New York Times, August 16, 1947. The great wave of organizing which the union engaged in during the Great Depression and the war significantly boosted the political power of a number of regional Teamsters leaders, and the leadership of the union engaged in a number of power struggles in the post-war period. By 1949, the union's membership had topped one million. Dave Beck (elected an international vice- president in 1940) was increasingly influential in the international union, and Tobin attempted to check his growing power but failed. In 1946, Beck successfully overcame Tobin's opposition and won approval of an amendment to the union's constitution creating the post of executive vice-president. Beck then won the 1947 election to fill the position. Beck also successfully opposed in 1947 a Tobin-backed dues increase to fund new organizing.Davies, \\"Teamsters Defeat Tobin On Tax Rise,\\" The New York Times, August 15, 1947. The following year, Beck was able to demand the ouster of the editor of International Teamster magazine and install his own man in the job.\\"Union Editor Is Ousted,\\" Associated Press, September 3, 1948. In 1948, Beck allied with his long-time rival Jimmy Hoffa and effectively seized control of the union. He announced a raid on the International Association of Machinists local at Boeing. Although President Dan Tobin publicly repudiated Beck's actions, Beck had more than enough support from Hoffa and other members of the executive board to force Tobin to back down.The NLRB subsequently held an election to determine who should represent the workers at Boeing. The Machinists won the 1949 election by a 2-to-1 margin. See \\"Beck Said to Top Tobin in Teamsters,\\" The New York Times, September 19, 1948; McCann, Blood in the Water: A History of District Lodge 751, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, 1989; Rodden, The Fighting Machinists: A Century of Struggle, 1984; Raskin, \\"Union Leader-And Big Business Man,\\" The New York Times, November 15, 1953. Five months later, Beck won approval of a plan to dissolve the union's four divisions and replace them with 16 divisions organized around each of the major job categories in the union's membership.\\"AFL Teamsters Begin Drastic Revamping,\\" The New York Times, January 18, 1949. In 1951, Tom Hickey, reformist leader of the Teamsters in New York City, won election to the Teamsters executive board. Tobin needed Beck's support to prevent Hickey's election, and Beck refused to give it.\\"Hickey In New Union Post,\\" Associated Press, August 28, 1951. On September 4, 1952, Tobin announced he would step down as president of the Teamsters at the end of his term.\\"D.J. Tobin Set to Retire,\\" The New York Times, September 5, 1952; \\"Battle for Control of Union Is Revealed,\\" The New York Times, October 7, 1952. At the union's 1952 convention, Beck was elected General President and pushed through a number of changes intended to make it harder for a challenger to build the necessary majority to unseat a president or reject his policies.Changes to the union constitution included expanding the number of vice-presidents, expanding the number of seats on the executive board, expanding the number of delegates, and enhancing the powers and authority of the president. \\"Teamsters Raise Tobin's Pay $20,000,\\" The New York Times, October 15, 1952; \\"Teamster Chiefs Defeat Opposition,\\" The New York Times, October 16, 1952; \\"Curbs On Officers Rejected By Teamsters,\\" The New York Times, October 17, 1952; \\"Teamsters Elect Beck As President,\\" Associated Press, October 18, 1952. =Influence of organized crime= Beck was elected to the Executive Council of the AFL on August 13, 1953, but his election generated a tremendous political battle between AFL President George Meany, who supported his election, and federation vice presidents who felt Beck was corrupt and should not be elected to the post. Beck was the first Teamster president to negotiate a nationwide master contract and a national grievance arbitration plan,\\"Teamsters to Ask Nation-Wide Pacts,\\" The New York Times, September 22, 1953; \\"Peace Plan Set Up In Truck Industry,\\" The New York Times, August 18, 1955. established organizing drives in the Deep SouthRaskin, \\"Teamsters Set Up Big Union Drives,\\" The New York Times, February 11, 1956; \\"Teamsters Map Southern Drive,\\" Associated Press, April 8, 1956. and the East,Raskin, \\"Teamsters Plan Big Drive In East,\\" The New York Times, January 10, 1957. and built the current Teamsters headquarters (the \\"Marble Palace\\") in Washington, D.C. on Louisiana Avenue NW (across a small plaza from the United States Senate).Loftus, \\"Union Buildings Rising in Capital,\\" The New York Times, April 3, 1955; \\"A.F.L. Teamsters' Union Moves to $5,000,000 Offices,\\" The New York Times, July 6, 1955. But his intervention in a construction and a milk strike (both centered on New York City), and refusal to intervene in a Northeastern trucking strike created major political problems for him. Perceiving Beck to be weak, Jimmy Hoffa began challenging Beck on various union decisions and policies in 1956 with an eye to unseating him as General President in the regularly scheduled union elections in 1957.Katz, \\"Teamsters' Union in Control Fight,\\" The New York Times, January 10, 1956. Infiltration by organized crime dominated the agenda of the Teamsters throughout the 1950s. The Teamsters had suffered from extensive corruption since its formation in 1903. Although the more extreme, public forms of corruption had been eliminated after General President Cornelius Shea was removed from office, the extent of corruption and control by organized crime increased during General President Tobin's time in office (1907 to 1952).Garnel, The Rise of Teamster Power in the West, 1972; Phelan, William Green: Biography of a Labor Leader, 1989. In 1929, the Teamsters and unions in Chicago even approached gangster Roger Touhy and asked for his protection from Al Capone and his Chicago Outfit, which were seeking to control the area's unions.Touhy, The Stolen Years, 1959; Touhy, When Capone's Mob Murdered Roger Touhy: The Strange Case of \\"Jake the Barber\\" and the Kidnapping That Never Happened, 2001; \\"Touhy Accuses Cop in $40,000 Capone Payoff,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, May 10, 1949; \\"Touhy Relates How Syndicate Invaded Unions,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, September 20, 1952; \\"Cites Gilbert Link to Labor Rackets,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, August 10, 1954; \\"Gangster Says Unions Paid to Fight Capone,\\" United Press International, September 20, 1952.

In Kansas City, corrupt Teamsters locals spent years seeking bribes, embezzling money, and engaging in extensive extortion and labor rackets as well as beatings, vandalism and even bombings in an attempt to control the construction and trucking industries.Lee, Farmers Vs.

The problem was so serious that the U.S. House of Representatives held hearings on the issue.\\"House Blasts Kansas City Tie-Up,\\" The New York Times, September 2, 1953. Hoffa's attempt to challenge Beck caused a major national scandal which led to two Congressional investigations, several indictments for fraud and other crimes against Beck and Hoffa, strict new federal legislation and regulations regarding labor unions, and even helped launch the political career of Robert F. Kennedy. Believing he needed additional votes to unseat Beck, in October 1956 mobster Johnny Dio met with Hoffa in New York City and the two men conspired to create as many as 15 paper localsA \\"paper local\\" is a local union, chartered by an international union or self-chartered, established for the purposes of fraud. It may have no members; the \\"members\\" may be relatives or individuals involved in organized crime rather than workers; or the union may claim to represent workers but in fact no relationship has been established. The holder of the charter for the paper local charter often enters into a sweetheart contract with an employer, or uses it as extortion (threatening to unionize the workers unless he receives a payoff). Paper locals are denounced by the AFL-CIO Code of Ethical Practices. See: Doherty, Industrial and Labor Relations Terms: A Glossary, 1989; \\"The Conglomerate of Crime,\\" Time, August 22, 1969. to boost Hoffa's delegate totals.\\"No Ordinary Hoodlum,\\" The New York Times, August 30, 1956.

Four of the paper locals were dissolved to avoid committee scrutiny, several Teamster staffers were charged with contempt of Congress, and union records were lost or destroyed (allegedly on purpose), and wiretaps were played in public before a national television audience in which Dio and Hoffa discussed the creation of even more paper locals.Raskin, \\"Union Dissolves Four Dio Locals,\\" The New York Times, February 15, 1957; Loftus, \\"Senators Study Two Unions Here,\\" The New York Times, February 16, 1957; \\"4 Teamsters' Aides Cited for Contempt In Balking Inquiry,\\" The New York Times, February 20, 1957; \\"Records Destroyed, M'Clellan Charges,\\" The New York Times, February 22, 1957; \\"More Data of Union Reported Missing,\\" Associated Press, February 23, 1957; \\"Teamster Admits Destroying Data,\\" The New York Times, March 14, 1957; \\"A Teamster Local, Under Fire, Robbed,\\" United Press International, March 17, 1957; \\"Wiretaps on Dio and Hoffa Cited,\\" The New York Times, February 23, 1957; \\"Labor Inquiry Gets Secret Tape Talks,\\" The New York Times, February 24, 1957; Mooney, \\"M'Clellan Hunts Auditor of Union and Son of Beck,\\" The New York Times, April 28, 1957. Evidence was unearthed of a mob-sponsored plot in which Oregon Teamsters unions would seize control of the state legislature, state police, and state attorney general's office through bribery, extortion and blackmail. Initially, members of the union did not believe the charges, and support for Beck was strong, but after three months of continuous allegations of wrongdoing many rank-and-file Teamsters withdrew their support and openly called for Beck to resign.Raskin, \\"Teamsters Stir Against Leaders,\\" The New York Times, March 22, 1957; \\"Protests Rise Among Teamsters Against Leaders Now Under Fire,\\" The New York Times, March 23, 1957; Raskin, \\"Teamster Sentiment Grows to Remove Beck and Aides,\\" The New York Times, March 28, 1957; \\"Beck Effigy Hanged By Union In Yakima,\\" Associated Press, March 29, 1957; \\"Portland Teamsters Fight Leaders,\\" Associated Press, March 29, 1957. Beck initially refused to address the allegations, but broke his silence and denounced the committee's inquiry on March 6.Raskin, \\"Teamsters Hear From Their Chief,\\" The New York Times, March 7, 1957.

In mid- March 1957, Jimmy Hoffa was arrested for allegedly trying to bribe a Senate aide. Hoffa denied the charges, but the arrest triggered additional investigations and more arrests and indictments over the following weeks. \\"8 Hoffa Aides in Detroit Get Subpoenas to Appear Before U.S. Rackets Jury Here,\\" The New York Times, March 20, 1957; \\"Hoffa, Attorney Plead Not Guilty,\\" The New York Times, March 30, 1957; Loftus, \\"Hoffa Urges Court to Quash Charges,\\" The New York Times, April 23, 1957; Ranzal, \\"Jury Here Indicts Hoffa On Wiretap,\\" The New York Times, May 15, 1957.

Several historic legal developments came out of the select committee's investigation. The scandals uncovered by the McClellan committee, which affected not only the Teamsters but several other unions, led directly to the passage of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (also known as the Landrum-Griffin Act) in 1959.\\"Union Curbs Foreseen,\\" The New York Times, May 13, 1957; \\"M'Clellan Sees Stiff Labor Law,\\" The New York Times, May 18, 1957; Loftus, \\"Congress Disclosures Forecast New Labor Legislation,\\" The New York Times, June 2, 1957; Raskin, \\"White House Gives Program to Curb Abuses in Unions,\\" The New York Times, December 6, 1957; Higgins and Janus, The Developing Labor Law: The Board, the Courts, and the National Labor Relations Act, 2006; Wilson, \\"Conquering the Enemy Within: The Case for Reform of the Landrum-Griffin Act,\\" Journal of Labor Research, December 2005; Lee, Eisenhower & Landrum-Griffin: A Study in Labor-Management Politics, 1990; Jacobs, Mobsters, Unions, and Feds: The Mafia and the American Labor Movement, 2006.

Rank- and-file anger over the McClellan Committee's revelations eventually led Beck to retire from the Teamsters and allowed Jimmy Hoffa to take over.

Beck refused to institute any reforms, and the election of Jimmy Hoffa (whom the AFL‚ÄìCIO considered as corrupt as Beck) led the labor federation to suspend the Teamsters union on October 24, 1957.Loftus, \\"Labor Suspends Teamster Union,\\" The New York Times, October 25, 1957. Meany offered to keep the Teamsters within the AFL‚ÄìCIO if Hoffa resigned as president, but Hoffa refused and the formal expulsion occurred on December 6, 1957.\\"A.F.L.-C.I.O. to Go Ahead With Expulsion of Teamsters,\\" The New York Times, December 4, 1957; Raskin, \\"Meany Will Drop Teamster Ouster If Hoffa Gets Out,\\" The New York Times, December 5, 1957; \\"Teamsters Await Expulsion Today,\\" The New York Times, December 6, 1957; Raskin, \\"A.F.L.-C.I.O.

Another was the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA), which represented stevedores in most East Coast ports. The Teamsters had long desired to bring all shipping and transportation workers into the union, so that no product could be moved anywhere in the U.S. without it being touched by Teamsters hands. As the ILA came under increasing attack for permitting corruption in its locals, President Beck sought to bring the ILA into the Teamsters.Raskin, \\"Dock Local Bolts to A.F.L. Teamsters in First Secession,\\" The New York Times, September 3, 1953. The AFL ousted the ILA in September 1953, and formed the International Brotherhood of Longshoremen-AFL (IBL-AFL) to represent longshoremen on the Great Lakes and East Coast.Raskin, \\"New Docker Union Free of Gang Rule Planned by A.F.L.,\\" The New York Times, September 19, 1953; Raskin, \\"A.F.L.

Post,\\" The New York Times, March 19, 1955; \\"Teamsters Cooling Toward I.L.A. Deal,\\" The New York Times, March 22, 1955. But even as Beck backed away from any ILA deal, Jimmy Hoffa secretly negotiated a major package of financial and staff aid to the ILA and then went public with the deal‚Äîforcing Beck to accept it as a fait accompli or risk embarrassing Hoffa.\\"I.L.A.

Raiding by the Teamsters was such a serious issue that it prompted the AFL and CIO, which had attempted to sign a no-raid agreement for years, to finally negotiate and implement such a pact in December 1953.Raskin, \\"A. F. L. Drafts Plan for Ban on Raiding,\\" The New York Times, December 11, 1953; Loftus, \\"Labor Still Seeks Union Raiding Ban,\\" The New York Times, December 15, 1953; Loftus, \\"A.F.L. and C.I.O.

Shortly thereafter, the AFL adopted Article 20 of its constitution, which prevented its member unions from raiding one another.Levey, \\"Union Raiding Ban Drafted By A.F.L.,\\" The New York Times, August 14, 1954. The union's affection for raiding led it to initially oppose the AFL‚ÄìCIO merger in January 1955, but it quickly reversed itself.Raskin, \\"Beck Puts Brake on Labor Merger,\\" The New York Times, January 28, 1955; Raskin, \\"Beck Joins Move for Labor Unity,\\" The New York Times, February 11, 1955. =Rise, fall, and disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa= Hoffa achieved his goal of unifying all freight drivers under a single collective bargaining agreement, the National Master Freight Agreement, in 1964. Hoffa used the grievance procedures of the agreement, which authorized selective strikes against particular employers, to police the agreement or, if Hoffa thought that it served the union's interest, to drive marginal employers out of the industry. The union won substantial gains for its members, fostering a nostalgic image of the Hoffa era as the golden age for Teamster drivers. Hoffa also succeeded where Tobin had failed, concentrating power at the international level, dominating the conferences which Beck and Dobbs had helped build. In addition, Hoffa was instrumental in using the assets of the Teamsters' pension plans, particularly the Central States plan, to support Mafia projects, such as the development of Las Vegas in the 1950s and 1960s. Pension funds were loaned to finance Las Vegas casinos such as the Stardust Resort & Casino, the Fremont Hotel & Casino, the Desert Inn, the Dunes hotel and casino (which was controlled by Hoffa's attorney, Morris Shenker), the Four Queens, the Aladdin Hotel & Casino, Circus Circus, and Caesars Palace. The pension fund also made a number of loans to associates and relatives of high-ranking Teamster officials. A close associate of Hoffa during this period was Allen Dorfman. Dorfman owned an insurance agency that provided insurance claims processing to the Teamsters' union, and which was the subject of an investigation by the McClellan Committee. Dorfman also had increasing influence over loans made by the Teamsters' pension fund, and after Hoffa went to prison in 1967, Dorfman had primary control over the fund. Dorfman was murdered in January 1983, shortly after his conviction, along with Teamsters' president Roy Lee Williams, in a bribery case.The Teamsters by Steven Brill; 1978 Simon and Schuster; New York, New York Hoffa was, moreover, defiantly unwilling to reform the union or limit his own power in response to the attacks from Robert F. Kennedy, formerly chief counsel to the McClellan Committee, then Attorney General. Kennedy's Department of Justice tried to convict Hoffa for a variety of offenses over the 1960s, finally succeeding on a witness tampering charge in 1964, with key testimony provided by Teamsters business agent Edward Grady Partin of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. After exhausting his appeals, Hoffa entered prison in 1967. Hoffa installed Frank Fitzsimmons, an associate from his days in Local 299 in Detroit, to hold his place for him while he served time. Fitzsimmons, however, began to enjoy the exercise of power in Hoffa's absence; in addition, the organized crime figures around him found that he was more pliant than Hoffa had been. While President Nixon's pardon barred Hoffa from resuming any role in the Teamsters until 1980, Hoffa challenged the legality of that condition and planned to run again for presidency of the union, but disappeared in 1975 under mysterious circumstances. He is presumed dead, although his body has never been found. =Decentralization, deregulation and drift= Under General President Frank Fitzsimmons, authority within the Teamsters was decentralized back into the hands of regional, joint council, and local leaders. While this helped solidify Fitzsimmons' own political position in the union, it also made it more difficult for the union to act decisively on policy issues. Fitzsimmons also moved the union's political stands slowly to the left, supporting universal health care, an immediate end to the Vietnam War, urban renewal, and community organizing. In 1968, Fitzsimmons and United Auto Workers President Walter Reuther formed the Alliance for Labor Action, a new national trade union center which competed with the AFL‚ÄìCIO. The Alliance dissolved in 1972 after Reuther's death. While the Teamsters won rich national master contracts in trucking and package delivery in the 1970s, it did little to adapt to the changes occurring in the transportation industry. A major jurisdictional battle with the United Farm Workers (UFW) broke out in 1970, and did not end until 1977. The Teamsters and UFW had both claimed jurisdiction over farm workers for many years, and in 1967 had signed an agreement settling their differences. But decentralization of power within the union led several Teamster leaders in California to repudiate this agreement without Fitzsimmons' permission and organize large numbers of field workers. His hand forced, Fitzsimmons ordered Teamsters contract negotiators to re-open the handful of contracts it had signed with California growers.According to the Teamsters, but disputed by UFW, these contracts had purposefully low wages and benefits so as not to make the UFW contracts look bad. See: \\"Teamsters End a Truce With Chavez's United Farm Workers.\\" The New York Times. December 15, 1972. The UFW sued, the AFL‚ÄìCIO condemned the action, and many employers negotiated contracts with the Teamsters rather than with the UFW.Turner, Wallace. \\"Teamsters Sued by Chavez's Union.\\" The New York Times.

By 1975, the UFW had won 24 elections and the Teamsters 14; UFW membership had plummeted to just 6,000 from nearly 70,000 while the Teamsters farmworker division counted 55,000 workers. The UFW signed an agreement with Fitzsimmons in March 1977 in which the UFW agreed to seek to organize only those workers covered by the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act, while the Teamsters retained jurisdiction over some agricultural workers, who had been covered by Teamsters Local Union contracts prior to the formation of the UFW.Turner, Wallace. \\"Chavez and Teamsters Sign Accord.\\" The New York Times. March 11, 1977. In October 1973, Fitzsimmons ended the long-running jurisdictional dispute with the United Brewery Workers, and the Brewery Workers merged with the Teamsters.\\"Brewery Workers Merger With Teamsters Is Backed.\\" The New York Times. October 24, 1973. In 1979 Congress passed legislation that deregulated the freight industry, removing the Interstate Commerce Commission's power to impose detailed regulatory tariffs on interstate carriers. The union tried to fight deregulation by attempting to bribe Senator Howard Cannon of Nevada. That attempt not only failed, but resulted in the conviction in 1982 of Roy Williams, the General President who had succeeded Fitzsimmons in 1981. Williams subsequently resigned in 1983 as a condition of remaining free on bail while his appeal proceeded. Deregulation had catastrophic effects on the Teamsters, opening up the industry to competition from non-union companies who sought to cut costs by avoiding unionization and curbing wages. Nearly 200 unionized carriers went out of business in the first few years of deregulation, leaving thirty percent of Teamsters in the freight division unemployed. The remaining unionized carriers demanded concessions in wages, work rules, and hours. Williams' successor, Jackie Presser, was prepared to grant most of these concessions in the form of a special freight \\"relief rider\\" that would cut wages by up to 35 percent and establish two-tier wages. Teamsters for a Democratic Union, which had grown out of efforts to reject the 1976 freight agreement, launched a successful national campaign to defeat the relief rider, which was defeated by a vote of 94,086 to 13,082. The pressure on the freight industry and the national freight agreement continued, however. By the end of the 1990s the National Master Freight Agreement, which had covered 500,000 drivers in the late 1970s, dropped to fewer than 200,000, with numerous local riders weakening it further in some areas. =Internal and external challenges= The decline in working conditions in the freight industry, combined with long-simmering unhappiness among members employed by the United Parcel Service, led to the development of two nationwide dissident groups within the union in the 1980s: Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU), an assemblage of a number of local efforts, and the Professional Drivers Council, better known as PROD, which began as a public interest group affiliated with Ralph Nader that was concerned with worker safety. The two groups merged in 1979. TDU was able to win some local offices within the union, although the International Union often attempted to make those victories meaningless by marginalizing the officer or the union. TDU acquired greater prominence, however, with the election reforms forced on the union by the consent decree it had entered into in 1989 on the eve of trial on a suit brought by the federal government under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The decree required the direct election of International officers by the membership, as TDU had been demanding for years leading up to the decree, to replace the indirect election by delegates at the union's convention. While the delegates at the union's 1991 convention balked at amending the Constitution, they ultimately capitulated under pressure from the government. That consent decree might not have been possible, however, if it had not been for the testimony of Roy Williams, who described, in an affidavit he gave the government in return for a delay of his imprisonment, his own dealings with organized crime as the Secretary-Treasurer of a local union in Kansas City and as an officer of the International Union. The decree also gave the government the power to install an Independent Review Board with the power to expel any member of the union for \\"conduct unbecoming to the union\\", which the IRB proceeded to exercise far more aggressively than the Teamsters officials who had agreed to the decree had expected. While the government was pursuing a civil case against the union as an entity it was also indicting Presser, who had succeeded Williams as General President, for embezzling from two different local unions in Cleveland prior to his election as President. Presser resigned in 1988, but died before his trial was scheduled to begin. He was succeeded by William J. McCarthy, who came from the same local that Dan Tobin had led eighty years earlier. The Independent Review Board (IRB) is a three-member panel established to investigate and take appropriate action with respect to \\"any allegations of corruption,\\" \\"any allegations of domination or control or influence\\" of any part of the Union by organized crime, and any failure to cooperate fully with the IRB. =Recent history= A Teamsters gathering at the YearlyKos 2007 convention In 1991, Ron Carey won a surprising victory in the first direct election for General President in the union's history, defeating two \\"old guard\\" candidates, R.V. Durham and Walter Shea. Carey's slate, supported by TDU, also won nearly all of the seats on the International Executive Board. Carey acquired a fair amount of influence within the AFL‚ÄìCIO, which had readmitted the Teamsters in 1985. Carey was close with the new leadership elected in 1995, particularly Richard Trumka of the United Mine Workers of America, who became Secretary- Treasurer of the AFL‚ÄìCIO under John Sweeney. Carey had also swung the Teamsters support behind the Democratic Party, a change from past administrations that had supported the Republican Party. The new administration set out to break from the past in other ways, making energetic efforts to head off a vote to oust the union as representative of Northwest Airlines' flight attendants, negotiating a breakthrough agreement covering carhaulers, and supporting local strikes, such as the one against Diamond Walnut, to restore the union's strength. The Carey administration did not, on the other hand, have much power in the lower reaches of the Teamster hierarchy: all of the large regional conferences were run by \\"old guard\\" officers, as were most of the locals. Disagreements between those two camps led the old guard to campaign against the Carey administration's proposed dues increase; the Carey administration retaliated by dissolving the regional conferences, calling them expensive redundancies and fiefdoms for old guard union officers. and rearranging the boundaries of some joint councils that had fought against the dues increase. The opposition responded by uniting around a single candidate, James P. Hoffa, son of James R. Hoffa, to run against Carey in 1996. Hoffa ran a strong campaign, trading on the mystique still attached to his late father's name and promising to restore those days of glory. Carey appeared, however, to have won a close election. Shortly afterward in 1997, the union initiated a large and successful strike against UPS. The parcel services department by that time had become the largest division in the union. Carey was removed from the union's leadership by the IRB shortly thereafter, when evidence that individuals in his office had arranged for transfer of several thousand dollars to an outside contractor, which then arranged for another entity to make an equivalent contribution to the Carey campaign. Carey was indicted for lying to investigators about his campaign funding but was acquitted of all charges in a 2001 trial. In the 1998 election to succeed Carey, James P. Hoffa was elected handily. He became president of the Teamsters on March 19, 1999, and took the union in a more moderate direction, tempering the union's support for Democrats and attempting to come to terms with powerful Republicans in Congress. The union has merged in recent years with a number of unions from other industries, including the Graphic Communications International Union, a printing industry union, and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes and Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, both from the railway industry. On July 25, 2005, the Teamsters disaffiliated from the AFL‚ÄìCIO and became a founding member of the new national trade union center, the Change to Win Federation.Amber and Bologna, \\"Departure of SEIU, Teamsters Creates Split Within AFL-CIO on Convention's Opening Day,\\" Labor Relations Week, July 28, 2005. In 2009, UPS, many employees of which are members of the Teamsters, lobbied to have language added to the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2009 (H.R. 915) to change how UPS and FedEx compete with one another. In response, FedEx launched a large, online advertising campaign aimed at UPS and the Teamsters, called 'Stop the Brown Bailout'. Internal Teamsters politics Prior to the 1970s, no long-lived caucuses existed within the Teamsters union. Challengers for office ran on their personal appeal and individual power base, rather than on caucus or \\"party\\" platforms and such challenges were infrequent. The Teamster leadership was well-established and somewhat self-perpetuating, and challengers only rarely achieved victories at the local and (even less frequently) regional levels.Tillman, p. 139-140. This changed in the 1970s. A national wildcat strike challenged President Frank Fitzsimmons' control over the union, but failed. After the strike, a reform movement known as \\"Teamsters United Rank and File\\" (TURF) formed to continue to challenge against the union's national leadership. But TURF collapsed after a few years due to internal dissent. In 1975, two new caucuses formed: Teamsters for a Decent Contract (TDC) and UPSurge. Both groups pushed the national leadership for a vastly improved contracts at UPS and the freight lines. In 1976 a new formal caucus, Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU), formed when TDC and UPSurge merged. The new caucus' goal was to make internal Teamster governance more transparent and democratic, which included giving rank-and-file more of a say in the terms and approval of contracts.Ryan, p. 418. In the 1980s, TDU occasionally won elections for positions on local councils, but it was not until 1983‚Äîwhen the TDU forced President Jackie Presser to withdraw and make changes to a concession-laden National Master Freight Agreement‚Äîthat TDU had a national impact.Tillman, p. 140. TDU publicized the very centralized and not very transparent national union decision-making process, criticized what it said was lack of member input into these decisions, and published contract, salary, membership, and other data critical of the national union leadership. These criticisms led to another success for TDU, with many TDU proposals finding their way into the 1988 court decree in which the federal government took over of the Teamsters. Although the TDU has never won the presidency of the national union as of mid-2013, it strongly supported Ron Carey for the presidency in 1991. Carey, in turn, adopted many of TDU's reform proposals as part of his platform. Carey ran with nearly a full slate (which included a candidate for secretary-treasurer and 13 vice presidencies).Only 10 of the 13 candidates running on Carey's slate were members of TDU. The Carey slate did not contest three of the seats on the Teamsters executive board. See: Kilborn, Peter T. \\"Carey Takes the Wheel.\\" The New York Times. June 21, 1992. Retrieved July 25, 2013. R.V. Durham, leader of the Teamsters in North Carolina, was considered the \\"establishment\\" candidate and front-runner in the campaign (he had the backing of a majority of the union's executive board). A second candidate in the race, Walter Shea, was a veteran union staffer from Washington, D.C. Carey won with 48.5 percent of the vote to Durham's 33.2 percent and Shea's 18.3 percent. (Turnout was low, only about 32 percent of the union's total membership.)McFadden, Robert D. \\"New Teamster Chief's Motto: Honest Work for Honest Pay.\\" The New York Times. December 15, 1991. Retrieved July 25, 2013. Carey's election, sociologist Charlotte Ryan says, was another success for TDU (even though Carey was not a TDU candidate). Carey won re- election in 1996 in a corrupt election, defeating James P. Hoffa (son of the former union president). Prior to entering the race, Hoffa formed a caucus of his own, the \\"Hoffa Unity Slate\\", to counter the grassroots organizing of TDU and Carey.Jacobs and Cooperman, p. 146. Carey was later ousted as union president by U.S. government officials. A re-run election in 1998 saw Hoffa and the Unity Slate easily defeat TDU candidate Tom Leedham 54.5 percent to 39.3 percent (with 28 percent turnout).West, Jim. \\"Can Hoffa 'Restore the Power'?\\" Labor Notes. January 7, 1999. Retrieved July 25, 2013. Hoffa was re- elected over Leedham (again running on the TDU platform) in 2001, 64.8 percent to 35.2 percent.Jacobs, p. 111. Leedham challenged Hoffa and the Hoffa Unity Slate a third time in 2006, losing 65 percent to 35 percent (with 25 percent turnout).\\"Hoffa Re-Elected Teamsters President.\\" Labor Notes.

Hoffa again easily won re-election, earning 60 percent of the vote to Gregare's 23 percent and Pope's 17 percent. The Hoffa Unity Slate also won all five regional vice presidencies, although the slate's support declined across the board.Moberg, David. \\"Hoffa Re-elected as Teamsters President, Easily Beating Two Challengers.\\" In These Times.

The 2016 election was also the first time Hoffa-allied candidates lost regional vice presidencies to the Teamsters United reform slate. Political donations Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. The Teamsters Union is one of the largest labor unions in the world, as well as the 11th largest campaign contributor in the United States. While they supported Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush for President in the 1980s, they have begun leaning largely toward the Democrats in recent years; they have donated 92% of their $24,418,589 in contributions since 1990 to the Democratic Party. Though the union opposed former President George W. Bush's agenda to open US highways to Mexican truckers, it did previously support Bush's platform for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. On July 23, 2008, however, Hoffa announced the union's withdrawal from the coalition favoring drilling there. Speaking before environmentalists and union leaders assembled to discuss good jobs and clean air, Hoffa said, \\"We are not going to drill our way out of the energy problems we are facing‚Äînot here and not in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\\" The Teamsters Union endorsed Barack Obama for the 2008 Democratic Nomination on February 20, 2008.\\"Teamsters endorse Obama for president\\" Cnn.com ElectionCenter2008 In the 2016 presidential election, the Teamsters endorsed Hillary Clinton on August 26, 2016.

Foresters engage in a broad range of activities including ecological restoration and management of protected areas. Foresters manage forests to provide a variety of objectives including direct extraction of raw material, outdoor recreation, conservation, hunting and aesthetics. Emerging management practices include managing forestlands for biodiversity, carbon sequestration and air quality. Many people confuse the role of the forester with that of the logger, but most foresters are concerned not only with the harvest of timber, but also with the sustainable management of forests to (in the words of Gifford Pinchot) \\"provide the greatest good for the greatest number in the long term\\". Another notable forester, Jack C. Westoby, remarked that \\"forestry is concerned not with trees, but with how trees can serve people\\". Career =United States= The median salary of foresters in the United States was $53,750, in 2008. Beginning foresters without bachelor's degrees make considerably less. Those with master's degrees are able to command salaries closer to the average. The Council for Higher Education Accreditation considers the Society of American Foresters as the principal accreditor for academic degree programs in professional forestry, both at a Bachelor's and Master's level. Usually a bachelor's degree is considered the minimum education required, but some individuals are able to secure a job without a college education based on their experience. Some states have a licensing requirement for foresters, and most of those require at least a four-year degree. Foresters are often employed by private industry, federal and state land management agencies, or private consulting firms. Medieval foresters Forester was also a title used widely during Medieval times. The forester usually held a position equal to a sheriff or local law enforcer, and he could act as a barrister or arbiter. He was often based in a forester's lodge, and was responsible for patrolling the woodlands on a lord or noble's property, hence the synonymous term 'woodward'. His duties included negotiating sales of lumber and timber and stopping poachers from illegally hunting. Frequently outlaws would take refuge in heavily wooded regions. When this occurred it was the duty of the forester to organize armed posses to capture or disperse the criminals and during war time foresters were used as scouts to spy on enemy troop movement. The pay and status of foresters was usually above average, reflecting the responsibility of their role in a medieval environment and economy.

Early life and education Michael Medved was born on October 3, 1948 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to parents Renate (n√©e Hirsch) and David Bernard Medved. His father was a Navy veteran and scientist. Raised in a Jewish home, his family's origin is German and Ukrainian. The surname Medved means a \\"bear\\" in the Slavic languages. Medved was raised in San Diego, California, where his father worked as a defense contractor for Convair and NASA. After the family moved to Los Angeles, California, he attended Palisades High School. Medved entered Yale University as a 16-year-old undergraduate. He received his B.A. with honors in 1969, and later attended Yale Law School, though he did not finish his J.D. degree. Medved volunteered for the 1968 presidential campaign of Robert F. Kennedy, and was present at his assassination. Career =Writer= After his first year of law school, Medved left to work as a head speechwriter for diplomat Joseph Duffey in his unsuccessful bid for U.S. Senate,Medved, Michael (2004).

Retrieved March 7, 2011. and then for four years as a speechwriter and political consultant. After political campaign work, including a position as an aide to Congressman Ron Dellums, Medved worked in advertising, and coordinated a campaign to recruit more African Americans and Hispanics to the police departments of San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley. After writing more than 40 articles for the book The People's Almanac, Medved wrote What Really Happened to the Class of '65?, with David Wallechinsky. Focusing on the post-graduation lives of 30 of Medved's Palisades High School classmates who were featured in a 1965 cover story in Time, the book became a bestseller in 1976. The book also became the basis for a weekly television series on NBC that ran for 13 weeks in 1978. As a result of some screenwriting work for feature film projects and television miniseries, Medved joined the Writers Guild of America. Medved wrote The Shadow Presidents: The Secret History of the Chief Executives and Their Top Aides (1979), a study of the leading White House assistants since the establishment of the presidential staff in 1857. The book included interviews with the chiefs of staff of presidents Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford. After the interviews, Medved continued his involvement in politics, befriending Ford's chief of staff, Dick Cheney, affiliating himself with the Republican Party, and campaigning for Ronald Reagan in 1980. In 1984, Medved wrote Hospital: The Hidden Lives of a Medical Center Staff, which was discussed in Time, on ABC's Nightline, and Good Morning America. The book focused on 30 staff people who worked together in a California teaching hospital. In collaboration with his brother, Harry Medved, he wrote four satirical books about movies: The Fifty Worst Films of All Time (1979), The Golden Turkey Awards (1980), The Hollywood Hall of Shame (1984) and Son of Golden Turkey Awards (1986). In November 2008, Medved released his eleventh nonfiction book, The 10 Big Lies About America: Combating Destructive Distortions About Our Nation. The follow up volume, The 5 Big Lies About American Business: Combating Smears Against the Free-Market Economy, was released in December 2009. =Film reviewer= As a film reviewer, Medved hosted a weekly spot on CNN (1980‚Äì83) and a show on British network Channel 4 called The Worst of Hollywood. His commentary centered on what he considered to be bad movies, particularly in \\"The Golden Turkey Awards\\". The film selected by the Medved Brothers as The Worst Film of All Time, Plan 9 from Outer Space, has become a cult classic. In 1984, Medved joined Sneak Previews, the weekly movie review show originated by Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, co- hosting the program for twelve years with Jeffrey Lyons. In 1993, Medved became chief film critic for the New York Post, a position he held for five years, during which he reviewed more than 700 movies for the newspaper. Afterwards, Medved played a prominent role in some movie-related controversies. Medved became an outspoken defender of Mel Gibson's film, The Passion of the Christ (2004), which had been criticized as antisemitic by many prominent Jewish groups. After Gibson's DUI arrest in July 2006, Medved wrote that he felt \\"betrayed\\" by Gibson's antisemitic outburst and urged Gibson to seek \\"reconciliation\\" with the Jewish community. Some film critics, including Roger Ebert and Jim Emerson, criticized Medved for mentioning the \\"right to die/assisted suicide\\" theme in Clint Eastwood's Oscar-winning Million Dollar Baby and these critics viewed Medved's statements as a plot spoiler. Medved stated that the inclusion of this theme in the film was \\"deeply misleading\\" because it was marketed as a Rocky-esque tale of a plucky female underdog in the boxing arena. Medved said that he carefully avoided revealing the final turn in the plot, but felt honor bound to inform his listeners and readers about the movie's content and provocative point of view. Roger Ebert criticized Medved, saying he \\"has for a long time been a political commentator, not a movie critic.\\" =Talk radio and political commentary= While focusing on the theme of Hollywood vs. America, radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh interviewed Medved and then asked him to guest-host his talk show. In 1996 Medved was offered his own local show on a major Seattle radio station. In his 2005 autobiographical book Right Turns: From Liberal Activist to Conservative Champion in 35 Unconventional Lessons, Medved says he welcomed the chance to speak to a wider audience about politics and morality, which were a focus of his written commentary and books. Medved's show was broadcast from Seattle and syndicated through Salem Radio Network. His three-hour daily show was broadcast on 200 stations coast to coast and reached more than 4.75 million listeners weekly. For ten consecutive years, Talkers Magazine listed Medved as one of its \\"Heavy Hundred\\" most important American talk show hosts, and in 2011 tied for eighth place in its ranking of talk hosts by audience size. Salem Radio announced on November 8, 2018, that Sebastian Gorka would replace Medved's time slot in 2019. Medved said that his show would continue in a \\"new format\\" at the same time (3‚Äì6p.m. Eastern Time). His show continues in that time slot on a smaller number of stations. Medved describes the show as \\"Your Daily Dose of Debate\\", often focused on listeners who call in to debate issues with the host. Guests have included those who are generally considered left-of-center, including Noam Chomsky, Michael Moore, John Shelby Spong, Oliver Stone, Warren Beatty, Ralph Nader, Barbara Boxer, Al Gore, Madeleine Albright, Ben Cohen, George Galloway, Thom Hartmann, Naomi Wolf, and Al Franken. Guests who are generally considered right-of-center include Robert Spencer, Condoleezza Rice, and Dinesh D'Souza. Medved describes himself as \\"your cultural crusader on politics and pop culture\\" and common themes on his show include current events, politics, American history and the entertainment industry. He reviews four or more new movies or DVD releases per week. The program also includes a weekly \\"Disagreement Day\\", focusing on callers from around the country who wish to contest anything Medved has stated in his written articles or on the radio, and a monthly (when the moon is full) \\"Conspiracy Day,\\" where callers from across the country expose what they consider the \\"hidden forces\\" behind \\"perplexing and painful present events.\\" He gives historical perspective to current events on the radio show, and has recorded vignettes on major historical events and people in American history, such as the American Revolution and Abraham Lincoln. Medved writes a regular column for USA Today and is a member of the Board of Contributors for USA Todays Forum Page, part of the newspaper‚Äôs Opinion section. He writes occasional op-ed pieces for The Wall Street Journal and blogs daily at Townhall.com. He also wrote the 1992 book Hollywood vs. America: Popular Culture and the War on Traditional Values, a condemnation of violence in cinema. In October 2007, Medved drew fire from critics after publishing a controversial column regarding the history of slavery in the United States, in which he wrote, \\"No, it's not true that the 'peculiar institution' featured kind-hearted, paternalistic masters and happy, dancing field-hands, any more than it's true that America displayed unparalleled barbarity or enjoyed disproportionate benefit from kidnapping and exploiting innocent Africans.\\"Medved, Michael (undated; circa late 2010). \\"Michael Medved ‚Äì Six Inconvenient Truths About the U.S. and Slavery\\". townhall.com. Retrieved March 7, 2011. He has argued that voters in the American Jewish community do not necessarily embrace candidates based on their support for the state of Israel as much as they passionately oppose candidates based on their identification with Christianity, especially the Christian Right.Etheridge, Eric (September 9, 2009). \\"The Neoconservative Question\\". Opinionator (blog of The New York Times). Retrieved March 7, 2011. Medved also states that the Orthodox community, which he states as less than ten percent of the American Jewish population, \\"gives nearly as disproportionate support to Republicans as their Reform, Conservative, and secular Jewish neighbors give to Democrats\\" and argues that this is because \\"The Orthodox feel no instinctive horror at political alliances with others who make faith the center of their lives.\\" Medved criticized the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign, taking a Never Trump stance. He has continued to criticize President Trump after the election. Personal life and religion Medved is married to Diane Elvenstar Medved; the couple have three children. Diane is a convert to Orthodox Judaism. In 1991, Medved co-founded Toward Tradition in Washington state with Orthodox rabbi Daniel Lapin and lobbyist Jack Abramoff. In October 1994, it co-sponsored the conference \\"Toward a New Alliance: American Jews and Political Conservatism\\", with 300 attendees, featuring panelists Grover Norquist (Americans for Tax Reform), Ralph Reed (Christian Coalition), William Kristol (editor, The Weekly Standard), and David Horowitz (Center for the Study of Popular Culture). Also with Lapin, Medved helped revitalize the Pacific Jewish Center, an Orthodox synagogue in Venice, California. For fifteen years, Medved served as president of PJC, which states that its mission is outreach to unaffiliated and disconnected Jews. In his book Right Turns: Unconventional Lessons from a Controversial Life, he states that his commitment to religion led to his conservative political outlook. He is a baal teshuva (returnee to Orthodox Judaism). In November 2007, Medved became a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute, hub of the intelligent design movement. On January 30, 2015, Medved announced during his live radio broadcast that he would be taking an indefinite leave of absence from his radio show to undergo treatment for throat cancer. He returned to the air on April 21.

It is an allied health profession performed by occupational therapists and occupational therapy assistants (OTA). OTs often work with people with mental health problems, disabilities, injuries, or impairments. The American Occupational Therapy Association defines an occupational therapist as someone who \\"helps people across their lifespan participate in the things they want and need to do through the therapeutic use of everyday activities (occupations). Common occupational therapy interventions include helping children with disabilities to participate fully in school and social situations, injury rehabilitation, and providing supports for older adults experiencing physical and cognitive changes.\\" Typically, occupational therapists are university-educated professionals and must pass a licensing exam to practice. Occupational therapists often work closely with professionals in physical therapy, speech- language pathology, audiology, nursing, social work, clinical psychology, medicine, and assistive technology. History =Early history= The earliest evidence of using occupations as a method of therapy can be found in ancient times. In c. 100 BCE, Greek physician Asclepiades treated patients with a mental illness humanely using therapeutic baths, massage, exercise, and music. Later, the Roman Celsus prescribed music, travel, conversation and exercise to his patients. However, by medieval times the use of these interventions with people with mental illness was rare, if not nonexistent.Quiroga, Virginia A. M., PhD (1995), Occupational Therapy: The First 35 Years, 1900‚Äì1930. Bethesda, Maryland: American Occupational Therapy Association, Inc. In 18th-century Europe, revolutionaries such as Philippe Pinel and Johann Christian Reil reformed the hospital system. Instead of the use of metal chains and restraints, their institutions used rigorous work and leisure activities in the late 18th century. This was the Moral Treatment era, developed in Europe during the Age of Enlightenment, where the roots of occupational therapy lie. Although it was thriving in Europe, interest in the reform movement fluctuated in the United States throughout the 19th century. It re-emerged in the early decades of the 20th century as Occupational Therapy. The Arts and Crafts movement that took place between 1860 and 1910 also impacted occupational therapy. In the US, a recently industrialized country, the arts and crafts societies emerged against the monotony and lost autonomy of factory work. Arts and crafts were used as a way of promoting learning through doing, provided a creative outlet, and served as a way to avoid boredom during long hospital stays. Eleanor Clarke Slagle (1870-1942) is considered to be the ‚Äúmother‚Äù of occupational therapy. Slagle, who was one of the founding members of the National Society for the Promotion of Occupational Therapy (NSPOT), proposed habit training as a primary occupational therapy model of treatment. Based on the philosophy that engagement in meaningful routines shape a person's wellbeing, habit training focused on creating structure and balance between work, rest and leisure. Although habit training was initially developed to treat individuals with mental health conditions, its basic tenets are apparent in modern treatment models that are utilized across a wide scope of client populations. In 1915 Slagle opened the first occupational therapy training program, the Henry B. Favill School of Occupations, at Hull House in Chicago. Slagle went on to serve as both AOTA president and secretary. In 1954, AOTA created the Eleanor Clarke Slagle Lectureship Award in her honor. Each year, this award recognizes a member of AOTA ‚Äúwho has creatively contributed to the development of the body of knowledge of the profession through research, education, or clinical practice.‚Äù =Development into a health profession= Occupational therapy. Toy making in psychiatric hospital. World War 1 era. The health profession of occupational therapy was conceived in the early 1910s as a reflection of the Progressive Era. Early professionals merged highly valued ideals, such as having a strong work ethic and the importance of crafting with one's own hands with scientific and medical principles. The National Society for the Promotion of Occupational Therapy (NSPOT), now called the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA), was founded in 1917 and the profession of Occupational Therapy was officially named in 1921. William Rush Dunton, one of the founders of NSPOT and visionary figure in the first decades of the profession struggled with \\"the cumbersomeness of the term occupational therapy\\", as it lacked the \\"exactness of meaning which is possessed by scientific terms\\". Other titles such as \\"work-cure\\",\\"ergo therapy\\"(ergo being the Greek root for \\"work\\"), and \\"creative occupations\\" were discussed as substitutes, but ultimately, none possessed the broad meaning that the practice of occupational therapy demanded in order to capture the many forms of treatment that existed from the beginning. Occupational therapy during WWI: bedridden wounded are knitting. The emergence of occupational therapy challenged the views of mainstream scientific medicine. Instead of focusing purely on the medical model, occupational therapists argued that a complex combination of social, economic, and biological reasons cause dysfunction. Principles and techniques were borrowed from many disciplines‚Äîincluding but not limited to physical therapy, nursing, psychiatry, rehabilitation, self-help, orthopedics, and social work‚Äîto enrich the profession's scope. Between 1900 and 1930, the founders defined the realm of practice and developed supporting theories. By the early 1930s, AOTA had established educational guidelines and accreditation procedures. The early twentieth century was a time in which the rising incidence of disability related to industrial accidents, tuberculosis, World War I, and mental illness brought about an increasing social awareness of the issues involved. The entry of the United States into World War I was also a crucial event in the history of the profession. Up until this time, occupational therapy had been concerned primarily with the treatment of people with mental illness. However, U.S. involvement in the Great War and the escalating numbers of injured and disabled soldiers presented a daunting challenge to those in command. The military enlisted the assistance of NSPOT to recruit and train over 1,200 \\"reconstruction aides\\" to help with the rehabilitation of those wounded in the war. With entry into World War II and the ensuing skyrocketing demand for occupational therapists to treat those injured in the war, the field of occupational therapy underwent dramatic growth and change. Occupational therapists needed to be skilled not only in the use of constructive activities such as crafts, but also increasingly in the use of activities of daily living. There was a struggle to keep people in the profession during the post-war years. Emphasis shifted from the altruistic war-time mentality to the financial, professional, and personal satisfaction that comes with being a therapist. To make the profession more appealing, practice was standardized, as was the curriculum. Entry and exit criteria were established, and the American Occupational Therapy Association advocated for steady employment, decent wages, and fair working conditions. Via these methods, occupational therapy sought and obtained medical legitimacy in the 1920s. The 1920s and 1930s were a time of establishing standards of education and laying the foundation of the profession and its organization. Eleanor Clarke Slagle proposed a 12-month course of training in 1922, and these standards were adopted in 1923. Educational standards were expanded to a total training time of 18-months in 1930 to place the requirements for professional entry on par with those of other professions. The first textbook was published in the United States for occupational therapy in 1947, edited by Helen S. Willard and Clare S. Spackman. The profession continued to grow and redefine itself in the 1950s. The profession also began to assess the potential for the use of trained assistants in the attempt to address the ongoing shortage of qualified therapists, and educational standards for occupational therapy assistants were implemented in 1960. The 1960s and 1970s were a time of ongoing change and growth for the profession as it struggled to incorporate new knowledge and cope with the recent and rapid growth of the profession in the previous decades. New developments in the areas of neurobehavioral research led to new conceptualizations and new treatment approaches, possibly the most groundbreaking being the sensory integrative approach developed by A. Jean Ayres. The profession has continued to grow and expand its scope and settings of practice. Occupational science, the study of occupation, was created in 1989 as a tool for providing evidence-based research to support and advance the practice of occupational therapy, as well as offer a basic science to study topics surrounding \\"occupation\\".Yerxa, E., Clark, F., Jackson, J., Pierce, D., & Zemke, R. (1989). An introduction to occupational science, A foundation for occupational therapy in the 21st century. Haworth Press. That said, occupational science continues to be largely theory driven to the present day, and its application to clinical practice is frequently questioned. In addition, occupational therapy practitioner's roles have expanded to include political advocacy (from a grassroots base to higher legislation); for example, in 2010 PL 111-148 titled the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act had a habilitation clause that was passed in large part due to AOTA's political efforts as noted in AOTA's Centennial website (AOTA, 2017). Furthermore, occupational therapy practitioners have been striving personally and professionally toward concepts of occupational justice and other human rights issues that have both local and global impacts. The World Federation of Occupational Therapist's Resource Centre has many position statements on occupational therapy's roles regarding their participation in human rights issues. Philosophical underpinnings The philosophy of occupational therapy has evolved over the history of the profession. The philosophy articulated by the founders owed much to the ideals of romanticism, pragmatism and humanism, which are collectively considered the fundamental ideologies of the past century. One of the most widely cited early papers about the philosophy of occupational therapy was presented by Adolf Meyer, a psychiatrist who had emigrated to the United States from Switzerland in the late 19th century and who was invited to present his views to a gathering of the new Occupational Therapy Society in 1922. At the time, Dr. Meyer was one of the leading psychiatrists in the United States and head of the new psychiatry department and Phipps Clinic at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.Meyer, A (1922). The philosophy of occupation therapy. Archives of Occupational Therapy, 1, 1‚Äì10. William Rush Dunton, a supporter of the National Society for the Promotion of Occupational Therapy, now the American Occupational Therapy Association, sought to promote the ideas that occupation is a basic human need, and that occupation is therapeutic. From his statements came some of the basic assumptions of occupational therapy, which include: * Occupation has a positive effect on health and well-being. * Occupation creates structure and organizes time. * Occupation brings meaning to life, culturally and personally. * Occupations are individual. People value different occupations. These assumptions have been developed over time and are the basis of the values that underpin the Codes of Ethics issued by the national associations. The relevance of occupation to health and well-being remains the central theme. In the 1950s, criticism from medicine and the multitude of disabled World War II veterans resulted in the emergence of a more reductionistic philosophy. While this approach led to developments in technical knowledge about occupational performance, clinicians became increasingly disillusioned and re-considered these beliefs.Turner, A. (2002). History and Philosophy of Occupational Therapy in Turner, A., Foster, M. and Johnson, S. (eds) Occupational Therapy and Physical Dysfunction, Principles, Skills and Practice. 5th Edition. Edinburgh, Churchill Livingstone, 3‚Äì24..Punwar, A.J. (1994). Philosophy of Occupational Therapy in Occupational Therapy, Principles and practice. 2nd Ed. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, 7‚Äì20. As a result, client centeredness and occupation have re-emerged as dominant themes in the profession. Over the past century, the underlying philosophy of occupational therapy has evolved from being a diversion from illness, to treatment, to enablement through meaningful occupation. Three commonly mentioned philosophical precepts of occupational therapy are that occupation is necessary for health, that its theories are based on holism and that its central components are people, their occupations (activities), and the environments in which those activities take place. However, there have been some dissenting voices. Mocellin, in particular, advocated abandoning the notion of health through occupation as he proclaimed it obsolete in the modern world. As well, he questioned the appropriateness of advocating holism when practice rarely supports it. Some values formulated by the American Occupational Therapy Association have been critiqued as being therapist- centric and do not reflect the modern reality of multicultural practice.Kielhofner, G. (1997). Conceptual Foundations of Occupational Therapy. 2nd Ed. Philadelphia, F.A. Davis.Hocking, C and Whiteford, G (1995). Multiculturalism in occupational therapy: A time for reflection on core values. Australian Occupational Therapy Journal, 42(4), 172‚Äì175. In recent times occupational therapy practitioners have challenged themselves to think more broadly about the potential scope of the profession, and expanded it to include working with groups experiencing occupational injustice stemming from sources other than disability.Occupational Therapy without borders:learning from the spirit of survivors, Kronenburg et al., Churchill Livingstone 2004 Examples of new and emerging practice areas would include therapists working with refugees,Occupation for Occupational Therapists, Matthew Molineux, Blackwell Publishing, 2004 children experiencing obesity,Cahill et al.

Creating partnerships to promote health and fitness in children, OT Practice, 10‚Äì13. and people experiencing homelessness.The Process and Outcomes of a Multimethod needs assessment at a homeless shelter, Finlayson et al. (2002), American Journal of Occupational Therapy  Practice frameworks  An occupational therapist works systematically with a client through a sequence of actions called the occupational therapy process. There are several versions of this process as described by numerous scholars. All practice frameworks include the components of evaluation (or assessment), intervention, and outcomes. This process provides a framework through which occupational therapists assist and contribute to promoting health and ensures structure and consistency among therapists. The Occupational Therapy Practice Framework (OTPF) is the core competency of occupational therapy in the United States. The OTPF framework is divided into two sections: domain and process. The domain includes environment, client factors, such as the individual's motivation, health status, and status of performing occupational tasks. The domain looks at the contextual picture to help the occupational therapist understand how to diagnose and treat the patient. The process is the actions taken by the therapist to implement a plan and strategy to treat the patient. The Canadian Model of Client Centered Enablement (CMCE) embraces occupational enablement as the core competency of occupational therapy and the Canadian Practice Process Framework (CPPF) as the core process of occupational enablement in Canada. The Canadian Practice Process Framework (CPPF) has eight action points and three contextual element which are: set the stage, evaluate, agree on objective plan, implement plan, monitor/modify, and evaluate outcome. A central element of this process model is the focus on identifying both client and therapists strengths and resources prior to developing the outcomes and action plan. Occupations According to the American Occupational Therapy Association's (AOTA) Occupational Therapy Practice Framework: Domain and Process, 3rd Edition (OTPF-3), an occupation is defined as any type of meaningful activity in which one engages in order to ‚Äúoccupy‚Äù one's time. These occupations can be goal-directed, task-oriented, purposeful, culturally relevant, role specific, individually tailored, or community-oriented, depending on one's values, beliefs, context, and environment. The following are examples of such occupations: * Activities of daily living (ADLs)American Occupational Therapy Association. (2014). Occupational therapy practice framework: Domain and process.

The capacity to maintain a balance between leisure and other occupation as well as using the equipment necessary appropriately. * Social participation ** Community *** The OTPF-3 defines this aspect of social participation as successful interaction through engagement in activities with a group (i.e. neighborhood, workplace, school, religious or spiritual group). ** Family *** The OTPF-3 cites Mosey (1996 p. 340) and defines this aspect of social participation as successful interaction within a familial role. ** Peer, friend *** The OTPF-3 defines this aspect of social participation as the distinctive levels of interaction and closeness which can include engagement in desired sexual activity.  Practice settings  According to the 2015 Salary and Workforce Survey by the American Occupational Therapy Association, occupational therapists work in a wide-variety of practice settings including: hospitals (26.6%), schools (19.9%), long term care facilities/skilled nursing facilities (19.2%), free-standing outpatient (10.7%), home health (6.8%), academia (6.1%), early intervention (4.6%), mental health (2.4%), community (2%), and other (15%). Recently, there is a trend of OTs moving towards working in the hospital setting and in the long-term care facilities/skilled nursing facilities setting, comprising 46% of the OT workforce.American Occupational Therapy Association. (2015). Salary and workforce survey: Executive summary. Retrieved from https://www.aota.org/~/media/Corporate/Files/Secure/Educations-Careers/Salary- Survey/2015-AOTA-Workforce-Salary-Survey-HIGH-RES.pdf The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) found that between 2006-2010 nearly half (45.6%) of occupational therapists worked in hospitals, 31.8% worked in the community, and 11.4% worked in a professional practice. Areas of practice The broad spectrum of OT practice makes it difficult to categorize the areas of practice, especially considering the differing health care systems globally. In this section, the categorization strategy from the American Occupational Therapy Association is used. However, in using this strategy here, it is important to note that there are a number of major areas of practice (e.g., orthopedics; neurological populations) that are not explicitly acknowledged by this strategy. =Children and youth= Platform swing with tire used during occupational therapy with children Occupational therapists work with infants, toddlers, children, youth, and their families in a variety of settings, including schools, clinics, homes, hospitals, and the community. Assessment of a person's ability to engage in daily, meaningful occupations is the initial step of occupational therapy (OT) intervention and involves evaluating a young person's occupational performance in areas of feeding, playing, socializing, daily living skills, or attending school. Occupational therapists take into consideration the strengths and weaknesses of a child's underlying skills which may be physical, cognitive, or emotional in nature, as well as the context and environmental demands at play. In planning treatment, occupational therapists work in collaboration with parents, caregivers, teachers, or the children and teens themselves in order to develop functional goals within a variety of occupations meaningful to the young client. Early intervention is an extremely important aspect of the daily functioning of a child between the ages of birth-3 years old. This area of practice sets the tone or standard for therapy in the school setting. OT's who practice in early intervention develop a family's ability to care for their child with special needs and promote his or her function and participation in the most natural environment as possible. Each child is required to have an Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) that focuses on the family's goals for the child. It's possible for an OT to serve as the family's service coordinator and facilitate the team process for creating an IFSP for each eligible child. Objectives that an occupational therapist addresses with children and youth may take a variety of forms. For example: * Providing splinting and caregiver education in a hospital burn unit. * Facilitating handwriting development through providing intervention to develop fine motor and writing readiness skills in school-aged children. * Providing individualized treatment for sensory processing difficulties. * Teaching coping skills to a child with generalized anxiety disorder. * Consulting with teachers, counselors, social workers, parents/ caregivers, or any person that works with children regarding modifications, accommodations and supports in a variety of areas, such as sensory processing, motor planning, visual processing, sequencing, transitions between schools, etc. * Instructing caregivers in regard to mealtime intervention for children with autism who have feeding difficulties. In the United States, pediatric occupational therapists work in the school setting as a \\"related service\\" for children with an Individual Education Plan (IEP). Every student who receives special education and related services in the public school system is required by law to have an IEP, which is a very individualized plan designed for each specific student (U.S. Department of Education, 2007). Related services are ‚Äúdevelopmental, corrective, and other supportive services as are required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education,‚Äù and include a variety of professions such as speech-language pathology and audiology services, interpreting services, psychological services, and physical and occupational therapy. As a related service, occupational therapists work with children with varying disabilities to address those skills needed to access the special education program and support academic achievement and social participation throughout the school day (AOTA, n.d.-b). In doing so, occupational therapists help children fulfill their role as students and prepare them to transition to post-secondary education, career and community integration (AOTA, n.d.-b). Occupational therapists have specific knowledge to increase participation in school routines throughout the day, including: * Modification of the school environment to allow physical access for children with disabilities * Provide assistive technology to support student success * Helping to plan instructional activities for implementation in the classroom * Support the needs of students with significant challenges such as helping to determine methods for alternate assessment of learning * Helping students develop the skills necessary to transition to post-high school employment, independent living or further education (AOTA). Other settings, such as homes, hospitals, and the community are important environments where occupational therapists work with children and teens to promote their independence in meaningful, daily activities. Outpatient clinics offer a growing OT intervention referred to as ‚ÄúSensory Integration Treatment‚Äù. This therapy, provided by experienced and knowledgeable pediatric occupational therapists, was originally developed by A. Jean Ayres, an occupational therapist. Sensory integration therapy is an evidence-based practice which enables children to better process and integrate sensory input from the child's body and from the environment, thus improving his or her emotional regulation, ability to learn, behavior, and functional participation in meaningful daily activities. Recognition of occupational therapy programs and services for children and youth is increasing worldwide. Occupational therapy for both children and adults is now recognized by the United Nations as a human right which is linked to the social determinants of health. As of 2018, there are over 500,000 occupational therapists working worldwide (many of whom work with children) and 778 academic institutions providing occupational therapy instruction. =Health and wellness= According to the American Occupational Therapy Association's (AOTA) Occupational Therapy Practice Framework, 3rd Edition, the domain of occupational therapy is described as \\"Achieving health, well-being, and participation in life through engagement in occupation\\".American Occupational Therapy Association. (2017). Occupational Therapy Practice Framework: Domain and Process (3rd Edition). American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 68, S4. doi:10.5014/ajot.2014.682006. Occupational therapy practitioners have a distinct value in their ability to utilize daily occupations to achieve optimal health and well-being. By examining an individual's roles, routines, environment, and occupations, occupational therapists can identify the barriers in achieving overall health, well-being and participation.American Occupational Therapy Association. (2015). \\"The Role of Occupational Therapy with Health Promotion\\" [Fact Sheet]. Retrieved August 1, 2019. Occupational therapy practitioners can intervene at primary, secondary and tertiary levels of intervention to promote health and wellness. It can be addressed in all practice settings to prevent disease and injuries, and adapt healthy lifestyle practices for those with chronic diseases.American Occupational Therapy Association. (2013). \\"Occupational therapy in the promotion of health and well-being\\". American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 67, S47-S59. Two of the occupational therapy programs that have emerged targeting health and wellness are the Lifestyle Redesign ProgramSimon, A. U., & Collins, C. E. R. (2017). \\"Lifestyle Redesign for chronic pain management: A retrospective clinical efficacy study\\". The American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 71(4), 1-7. and the REAL Diabetes Program.Pyatak, E.A., Carandang, K., & Davis, S. (2015). \\"Developing a manualized occupational therapy diabetes management intervention: Resilient, Empowered, Active Living with diabetes\\". OTJR: Occupation, Participation and Health, 35(3), 187-194. Occupational therapy interventions for health and wellness vary in each setting: School Occupational therapy practitioners target school-wide advocacy for health and wellness including: bullying prevention, backpack awareness, recess promotion, school lunches, and PE inclusion. They also heavily work with students with learning disabilities such as those on the autism spectrum. A study conducted in Switzerland showed that a large majority of occupational therapists collaborate with schools, half of them providing direct services within mainstream school settings. The results also show that services were mainly provided to children with medical diagnoses, focusing on the school environment rather than the child's disability. Outpatient Occupational therapy practitioners conduct 1:1 treatment sessions and group interventions to address: leisure, health literacy and education, modified physical activity, stress/anger management, healthy meal preparation, and medication management. Acute care Occupational therapy practitioners conduct 1:1 treatment sessions, group interventions and promote hospital-wide programs targeting: leisure, stress management, pain management techniques, physical activity, healthy food recommendations, and medication management. Community-based Occupational therapy practitioners develop and implement community wide programs to assist in prevention of diseases and encourage healthy lifestyles by: conducting education classes for prevention, facilitating gardening, offering ergonomic assessments, and offering pleasurable leisure and physical activity programs. =Mental health= The occupational therapy profession believes that the health of an individual is fostered through active engagement in one's occupations (AOTA, 2014). When a person is experiencing any mental health need, his or her ability to actively participate in occupations may be hindered. For example, if a person has depression or anxiety, he or she may experience interruptions in sleep, difficulty completing self-care tasks, decreased motivation to participate in leisure activities, decreased concentration for school or job related work, and avoidance of social interactions. Occupational therapy practitioners possess the educational knowledge base in mental health and can contribute to the efforts in mental health promotion, prevention, and intervention. Occupational therapy practitioners can provide services that focus on social emotional well-being, prevention of negative behaviors, early detection through screenings, and intensive intervention (Bazyk & Downing, 2017). Occupational therapy practitioners can work directly with clients, provide professional development for staff, and work in collaboration with other team members and families. For instance, occupational therapists are specifically skilled at understanding the relationship between the demands of a task and the person's abilities. With this knowledge, practitioners are able to devise an intervention plan to facilitate successful participation in meaningful occupations. Occupational therapy services can focus on engagement in occupation to support participation in areas related to school, education, work, play, leisure, ADLs, and instrumental ADLs (Bazyk & Downing, 2017). Occupational therapy utilizes the public health approach to mental health (WHO, 2001) which emphasizes the promotion of mental health as well as the prevention of, and intervention for, mental illness. This model highlights the distinct value of occupational therapists in mental health promotion, prevention, and intensive interventions across the lifespan (Miles et al., 2010). Below are the three major levels of service: Tier 3: intensive interventions Intensive interventions are provided for individuals with identified mental, emotional, or behavioral disorders that limit daily functioning, interpersonal relationships, feelings of emotional well-being, and the ability to cope with challenges in daily life. Occupational therapy practitioners are committed to the recovery model which focuses on enabling persons with mental health challenges through a client-centered process to live a meaningful life in the community and reach their potential (Champagne & Gray, 2011). The focus of intensive interventions (direct‚Äìindividual or group, consultation) is engagement in occupation to foster recovery or ‚Äúreclaiming mental health‚Äù resulting in optimal levels of community participation, daily functioning, and quality of life; functional assessment and intervention (skills training, accommodations, compensatory strategies) (Brown, 2012); identification and implementation of healthy habits, rituals, and routines to support wellness. Tier 2: targeted services Targeted services are designed to prevent mental health problems in persons who are at risk of developing mental health challenges, such as those who have emotional experiences (e.g., trauma, abuse), situational stressors (e.g., physical disability, bullying, social isolation, obesity) or genetic factors (e.g., family history of mental illness). Occupational therapy practitioners are committed to early identification of and intervention for mental health challenges in all settings. The focus of targeted services (small groups, consultation, accommodations, education) is engagement in occupations to promote mental health and diminish early symptoms; small, therapeutic groups (Olson, 2011); environmental modifications to enhance participation (e.g., create sensory-friendly classrooms, home, or work environments) Tier 1: universal services Universal services are provided to all individuals with or without mental health or behavioral problems, including those with disabilities and illnesses (Barry & Jenkins, 2007). Occupational therapy services focus on mental health promotion and prevention for all: encouraging participation in health-promoting occupations (e.g., enjoyable activities, healthy eating, exercise, adequate sleep); fostering self-regulation and coping strategies (e.g., mindfulness, yoga); promoting mental health literacy (e.g., knowing how to take care of one's mental health and what to do when experiencing symptoms associated with ill mental health). Occupational therapy practitioners develop universal programs and embed strategies to promote mental health and well-being in a variety of settings, from schools to the workplace. The focus of universal services (individual, group, school-wide, employee/organizational level) is universal programs to help all individuals successfully participate in occupations that promote positive mental health (Bazyk, 2011); educational and coaching strategies with a wide range of relevant stakeholders focusing on mental health promotion and prevention; the development of coping strategies and resilience; environmental modifications and supports to foster participation in health-promoting occupations. =Productive aging= Occupational therapists work with older adults to maintain independence, participate in meaningful activities, and live fulfilling lives. Some examples of areas that occupational therapists address with older adults are driving, aging in place, low vision, and dementia or Alzheimer's Disease (AD). When addressing driving, driver evaluations are administered to determine if drivers are safe behind the wheel. To enable independence of older adults at home, occupational therapists perform falls risk assessments, assess clients functioning in their homes, and recommend specific home modifications. When addressing low vision, occupational therapists modify tasks and the environment. While working with individuals with AD, occupational therapists focus on maintaining quality of life, ensuring safety, and promoting independence. =Geriatrics/productive aging= Occupational therapists address all aspects of aging from health promotion to treatment of various disease processes. The goal of occupational therapy for older adults is to ensure that older adults can maintain independence and reduce health care costs associated with hospitalization and institutionalization. In the community, occupational therapists can assess an older adults ability to drive and if they are safe to do so. If it is found that an individual is not safe to drive the occupational therapist can assist with finding alternate transit options. Occupational therapists also work with older adults in their home as part of home care. In the home, an occupational therapist can work on such things as fall prevention, maximizing independence with activities of daily living, ensuring safety and being able to stay in the home for as long as the person wants. An occupational therapist can also recommend home modifications to ensure safety in the home. Many older adults suffer from chronic conditions such as diabetes, arthritis, and cardiopulmonary conditions. Occupational therapists can help manage these conditions by offering education on energy conservation strategies or coping strategies. Not only do occupational therapists work with older adults in their homes, they also work with older adults in hospitals, nursing homes and post-acute rehabilitation. In nursing homes, the role of the occupational therapist is to work with clients and caregivers on education for safe care, modifying the environment, positioning needs and enhancing IADL skills to name a few. In post-acute rehabilitation, occupational therapists work with clients to get them back home and to their prior level of function after a hospitalization for an illness or accident. Occupational therapists also play a unique role for those with dementia. The therapist may assist with modifying the environment to ensure safety as the disease progresses along with caregiver education to prevent burnout. Occupational therapists also play a role in palliative and hospice care. The goal at this stage of life is to ensure that the roles and occupations that the individual finds meaningful continue to be meaningful. If the person is no longer able to perform these activities, the occupational therapist can offer new ways to complete these tasks while taking into consideration the environment along with physical, psychosocial and physical needs. Not only do occupational therapists work with older adults in traditional settings they also work in senior centers and ALFs. =Visual impairment= Visual impairment is one of the top 10 disabilities among American adults.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.(2015)., Prevalence of disability and disability type among adults ‚Äì United States, 2013. Occupational therapists work with other professions, such as optometrists, ophthalmologists, and certified low vision therapists, to maximize the independence of persons with a visual impairment by using their remaining vision as efficiently as possible. AOTA's promotional goal of ‚ÄúLiving Life to Its Fullest‚Äù speaks to who people are and learning about what they want to do,AOTA. (2018)., Occupational therapy brand toolbox wallet-sized guide particularly when promoting the participation in meaningful activities, regardless of a visual impairment. Populations that may benefit from occupational therapy includes older adults, persons with traumatic brain injury, adults with potential to return to driving, and children with visual impairments. Visual impairments addressed by occupational therapists may be characterized into 2 types including low vision or a neurological visual impairment. An example of a neurological impairment is a cortical visual impairment (CVI) which is defined as ‚Äú...abnormal or inefficient vision resulting from a problem or disorder affecting the parts of brain that provide sight‚Äù.Anderson, S. L. & Lehman, S. S. (2014). Treating the visual consequences of traumatic brain injury, OT Practice, 19 (20), 7-11. The following section will discuss the role of occupational therapy when working with the visually impaired. Occupational therapy for older adults with low vision includes task analysis, environmental evaluation, and modification of tasks or the environment as needed. Many occupational therapy practitioners work closely with optometrists and ophthalmologists to address visual deficits in acuity, visual field, and eye movement in people with traumatic brain injury, including providing education on compensatory strategies to complete daily tasks safely and efficiently. Adults with a stable visual impairment may benefit from occupational therapy for the provision of a driving assessment and an evaluation of the potential to return to driving. Lastly, occupational therapy practitioners enable children with visual impairments to complete self care tasks and participate in classroom activities using compensatory strategies.Warren & Noble.(2016)., Occupational therapy services for persons with visual impairment, American Occupational Therapy Association Fact Sheet. =Adult rehabilitation= Occupational therapists address the need for rehabilitation following an injury or impairment. When planning treatment, occupational therapists address the physical, cognitive, psychosocial, and environmental needs involved in adult populations across a variety of settings. Occupational therapy in adult rehabilitation may take a variety of forms: * Working with adults with autism at day rehabilitation programs to promote successful relationships and community participation through instruction on social skills * Increasing the quality of life for an individual with cancer by engaging them in occupations that are meaningful, providing anxiety and stress reduction methods, and suggesting fatigue management strategies * Coaching individuals with hand amputations how to put on and take off a myoelectrically controlled limb as well as training for functional use of the limb * As for paraplegics, there are such things as sitting cushion and pressure sore prevention. Prescription of these aids is the common job for paraplegics. * Using and implementing new technology such as speech to text software and Nintendo Wii video games * Communicating via telehealth methods as a service delivery model for clients who live in rural areas * Working with adults who have had a stroke to regain their activities of daily living =Assistive technology= Occupational therapy practitioners, or occupational therapists (OTs), are uniquely poised to educate, recommend, and promote the use of assistive technology to improve the quality of life for their clients. OTs are able to understand the unique needs of the individual in regards to occupational performance and have a strong background in activity analysis to focus on helping clients achieve goals. Thus, the use of varied and diverse assistive technology is strongly supported within occupational therapy practice models.https://www.aota.org/About-Occupational- Therapy/Professionals/RDP/assistive-technology.aspx =Travel occupational therapy= Because of the rising need for occupational therapy practitioners in the U.S., many facilities are opting for travel occupational therapy practitioners‚Äîwho are willing to travel, often out of state, to work temporarily in a facility. Assignments can range from 8 weeks to 9 months, but typically last 13‚Äì26 weeks in length. Travel therapists work in many different settings, but the highest need for therapists are in home health and skilled nursing facility settings. There are no further educational requirements needed to be a travel occupational therapy practitioner; however, there may be different state licensure guidelines and practice acts that must be followed. According to Zip Recruiter, as of July 2019, the national average salary for a full-time travel therapist is $86,475 with a range between $62,500 to $100,000 across the United States. Most commonly (43%), travel occupational therapists enter the industry between the ages of 21‚Äì30. =Occupational justice= The practice area of occupational justice relates to the ‚Äúbenefits, privileges and harms associated with participation in occupations‚Äù and the effects related to access or denial of opportunities to participate in occupations. This theory brings attention to the relationship between occupations, health, well-being, and quality of life. Occupational justice can be approached individually and collectively. The individual path includes disease, disability, and functional restrictions. The collective way consists of public health, gender and sexual identity, social inclusion, migration, and environment. The skills of occupational therapy practitioners enable them to serve as advocates for systemic change, impacting institutions, policy, individuals, communities, and entire populations. Examples of populations that experience occupational injustice include refugees, prisoners, homeless persons, survivors of natural disasters, individuals at the end of their life, people with disabilities, elderly living in residential homes, individuals experiencing poverty, children, immigrants, and LGBTQI+ individuals. For example, the role of an occupational therapist working to promote occupational justice may include: * Analyzing task, modifying activities and environments to minimize barriers to participation in meaningful activities of daily living. * Addressing physical and mental aspects that may hinder a person's functional ability. * Provide intervention that is relevant to the client, family, and social context. * Contribute to global health by advocating for individuals with disabilities to participate in meaningful activities on a global level. Occupation therapists are involved with the World Health Organization (WHO), non-governmental organizations and community groups and policymaking to influence the health and well-being of individuals with disabilities worldwide Occupational therapy practitioners‚Äô role in occupational justice is not only to align with perceptions of procedural and social justice but to advocate for the inherent need of meaningful occupation and how it promotes a just society, well-being, and quality of life among people relevant to their context. It is recommended to the clinicians to consider occupational justice in their everyday practice to promote the intention of helping people participate in tasks that they want and need to do. =Occupational injustice= In contrast, occupational injustice relates to conditions wherein people are deprived, excluded or denied of opportunities that are meaningful to them. Types of occupational injustices and examples within the OT practice include: * Occupational deprivation: The exclusion from meaningful occupations due to external factors that are beyond the person's control. As an example, a person who has difficulties with functional mobility may find it challenging to reintegrate into the community due to transportation barriers. *Occupational apartheid: The exclusion of a person in chosen occupations due to personal characteristics such as age, gender, race, nationality or socioeconomic status. An example can be seen in children with developmental disabilities from low socioeconomic backgrounds whose families would opt out from therapy due to financial constraints. * Occupational marginalization: Relates to how implicit norms of behavior or societal expectations prevents a person from engaging in a chosen occupation. As an example, a child with physical impairments may only be offered table-top leisure activities instead of sports as an extracurricular activity due to the functional limitations caused by his physical impairments. * Occupational imbalance: The limited participation in a meaningful occupation brought about by another role in a different occupation. This can be seen in the situation of a caregiver of a person with disability who also has to fulfill other roles such as being a parent to other children, a student or a worker. * Occupational alienation: The imposition of an occupation which does not hold meaning for that person. In the OT profession, this manifests in the provision of rote activities which does not really relate to the goals or the interest of the client. Within occupational therapy practice, injustice may ensue in situations wherein professional dominance, standardized treatments, laws and political conditions create a negative impact on the occupational engagement of our clients. Awareness of these injustices will enable the therapist to reflect on his own practice and think of ways in approaching their client's problems while promoting occupational justice. =Community-based therapy= As occupational therapy (OT) has grown and developed, community-based practice has blossomed from an emerging area of practice to a fundamental part of occupational therapy practice (Scaffa & Reitz, 2013). Community-based practice allows for OTs to work with clients and other stakeholders such as families, schools, employers, agencies, service providers, stores, day treatment and day care and others who may influence the degree of success the client will have in participating. It also allows the therapist to see what is actually happening in the context and design interventions relevant to what might support the client in participating and what is impeding her or him from participating.Scaffa, M. E., & Reitz, S. M. (2013). Occupational therapy community-based practice settings. FA Davis. Community-based practice crosses all of the categories within which OTs practice from physical to cognitive, mental health to spiritual, all types of clients may be seen in community-based settings. The role of the OT also may vary, from advocate to consultant, direct care provider to program designer, adjunctive services to therapeutic leader.  Education  Worldwide, there is a range of qualifications required to practice as an occupational therapist or occupational therapy assistant. Depending on the country and expected level of practice, degree options include associate degree, Bachelor's degree, entry- level master's degree, post-professional master's degree, entry-level Doctorate (OTD), post-professional Doctorate (OTD), Doctor of Clinical Science in OT (CScD), Doctor of Philosophy in Occupational Therapy (PhD), and combined OTD/PhD degrees. Both occupational therapist and occupational therapy assistant roles exist internationally. Currently in the United States, dual points of entry exist for both OT and OTA programs. For OT, that is entry- level Master's or entry-level Doctorate. For OTA, that is associate degree or bachelor's degree. The World Federation of Occupational Therapists (WFOT) has minimum standards for the education of OTs, which was revised in 2016. All of the educational programs around the world need to meet these minimum standards. These standards are subsumed by and can be supplemented with academic standards set by a country's national accreditation organization. As part of the minimum standards, all programs must have a curriculum that includes practice placements (fieldwork). Examples of fieldwork settings include: acute care, inpatient hospital, outpatient hospital, skilled nursing facilities, schools, group homes, early intervention, home health, and community settings. The profession of occupational therapy is based on a wide theoretical and evidence based background. The OT curriculum focuses on the theoretical basis of occupation through multiple facets of science, including occupational science, anatomy, physiology, biomechanics, and neurology. In addition, this scientific foundation is integrated with knowledge from psychology, sociology and more. In the United States, Canada, and other countries around the world, there is a licensure requirement. In order to obtain an OT or OTA license, one must graduate from an accredited program, complete fieldwork requirements, and pass a national certification examination. Theoretical frameworks A distinguishing facet of occupational therapy is that therapists often espouse the use theoretical frameworks to frame their practice. Nonetheless, many have also argued that the use of theory complicates everyday clinical care and is not necessary to provide patient-driven care. Note that terminology differs between scholars. An incomplete list of theoretical bases for framing a human and their occupations include the following: =Generic models= Generic models are the overarching title given to a collation of compatible knowledge, research and theories that form conceptual practice.Foster, M. (2002) \\"Theoretical Frameworks\\", In: Occupational Therapy and Physical Dysfunction, Eds. Turner, Foster & Johnson. More generally they are defined as \\"those aspects which influence our perceptions, decisions and practice\\".Rogers JC (1983), Eleanor Clarke Slagle Lecture. Clinical Reasoning; the ethics, science and art. American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 37(9):601‚Äì616 * Person Environment Occupation Performance Model **The Person Environment Occupation Performance model (PEOP) was originally published in 1991 (Charles Christiansen & M. Carolyn BaumChristiansen, CH, Baum, MC & Bass, JD. (pp 84‚Äì104) (2011) In Duncan, EAS (Ed). Foundations for Practice in Occupational Therapy. (5th Ed). London, Churchill-Livingstone) and describes an individual's performance based on four elements including: environment, person, performance and occupation. The model focuses on the interplay of these components and how this interaction works to inhibit or promote successful engagement in occupation. Occupation-Focused Practice Models * Occupational Therapy Intervention Process Model (OTIPM) (Anne Fisher and others) * Occupational Performance Process Model (OPPM) * Model of Human Occupation (MOHO) (Gary Kielhofner and others) **MOHO was first published in 1980. It explains how people select, organise and undertake occupations within their environment. The model is supported with evidence generated over thirty years and has been successfully applied throughout the world.Kielhofner, G. (2008) Model of Human Occupation: Theory and Application. 4th edn. Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins * Canadian Model of Occupational Performance and Engagement (CMOP-E) * Occupational Performances Model ‚Äì Australia (OPM-A) (Chris Chapparo & Judy Ranka) **The OPM(A) was conceptualized in 1986 with its current form launched in 2006. The OPM(A) illustrates the complexity of occupational performance, the scope of occupational therapy practice, and provides a framework for occupational therapy education. * Kawa (River) Model (Michael Iwama) *The Biopsychosocial Model ** The biopsychosocial model takes into account how disease and illness can be impacted by social, environmental, psychological and body functions. The biopsychosocial model is unique in that it takes the client's subjective experience and the client-provider relationship as factors to wellness. This model also factors in cultural diversity as many countries have different societal norms and beliefs. This is a multifactorial and multi-dimensional model to understand not only the cause of disease but also a person-centered approach that the provider has more of a participatory and reflective role. =Frames of reference= Frames of reference are an additional knowledge base for the occupational therapist to develop their treatment or assessment of a patient or client group. Though there are conceptual models (listed above) that allow the therapist to conceptualize the occupational roles of the patient, it is often important to use further reference to embed clinical reasoning. Therefore, many occupational therapists will use additional frames of reference to both assess and then develop therapy goals for their patients or service users. As with the conceptual models discussed above, these frames of reference are used infrequently in routine clinical practice, and often obfuscate clinical decision-making. , * Biomechanical frame of reference **The biomechanical frame of reference is primarily concerned with motion during occupation. It is used with individuals who experience limitations in movement, inadequate muscle strength or loss of endurance in occupations. The frame of reference was not originally compiled by occupational therapists, and therapists should translate it to the occupational therapy perspective,McMillan, R. (2002) 'Assumptions Underpinning a Biomechanical Frame of Reference in Occupational Therapy' in Duncan (ed), Foundations for Practice in Occupational Therapy. London: Elsevier Limited. pp. 255‚Äì275 to avoid the risk of movement or exercise becoming the main focus.Foster, M. (2002) 'Theoretical Frameworks' in Turner, Foster and Johnson (eds) Occupational Therapy and Physical Dysfunction: Principles, Skills and Practice. London: Churchill Livingstone * Rehabilitative (compensatory) * Neurofunctional (Gordon Muir Giles and Clark-Wilson) * Dynamic systems theory * Client-centered frame of reference **This frame of reference is developed from the work of Carl Rogers. It views the client as the center of all therapeutic activity, and the client's needs and goals direct the delivery of the occupational therapy Process.Parker, D. (2002) 'The Client-Centered Frame of Reference' in Duncan (ed), Foundations for Practice in Occupational Therapy. London: Elsevier Limited. pp. 193‚Äì215 * Cognitive-behavioural frame of reference * Ecology of human performance model * The recovery model * Sensory integration **Sensory integration framework is commonly implemented in clinical, community, and school-based occupational therapy practice. It is most frequently used with children with developmental delays and developmental disabilities such as autism spectrum disorder and dyspraxia.Parham, L. D., & Mailloux, Z. (2010). Sensory integration. In J. Case-Smith & J. C. O‚ÄôBrien (Eds.), Occupational therapy for children (pp. 325-372). Maryland Heights, MO: Mosby Elsevier. Core features of sensory integration in treatment include providing opportunities for the client to experience and integrate feedback using multiple sensory systems, providing therapeutic challenges to the client's skills, integrating the client's interests into therapy, organizing of the environment to support the client's engagement, facilitating a physically safe and emotionally supportive environment, modifying activities to support the client's strengths and weaknesses, and creating sensory opportunities within the context of play to develop intrinsic motivation.Parham, L. D., Cohn, E. S., Spitzer, S., Koomar, J. A., Miller, L. M., Burke, J. P. ‚Ä¶ Summers, C. A. (2007). Fidelity in sensory integration intervention research. American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 61, 216-227. While sensory integration is traditionally implemented in pediatric practice, there is emerging evidence for the benefits of sensory integration strategies for adults.Bailliard, A. L., & Whigham, S. C. (2017). Centennial Topics‚ÄîLinking neuroscience, function, and intervention: A scoping review of sensory processing and mental illness. American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 71, 7105100040. https://doi.org/10.5014/ajot.2017.024497.Meredith, P. J., Bailey, K. J., Strong, J., & Rappel, G. (2016). Adult attachment, sensory processing, and distress in healthy adults. American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 70, 7001250010. https://dx.doi.org/10.5014/ajot.2016.017376 ICF The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is a framework to measure health and ability by illustrating how these components impact one's function. This relates very closely to the Occupational Therapy Practice Framework, as it is stated that \\"the profession's core beliefs are in the positive relationship between occupation and health and its view of people as occupational beings\\".American Occupational Therapy Association. (2008). Occupational therapy practice framework: Domain and process (2nd ed). American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 62, 625‚Äì683. The ICF is built into the 2nd edition of the practice framework. Activities and participation examples from the ICF overlap Areas of Occupation, Performance Skills, and Performance Patterns in the framework. The ICF also includes contextual factors (environmental and personal factors) that relate to the framework's context. In addition, body functions and structures classified within the ICF help describe the client factors described in the Occupational Therapy Practice Framework.American Occupational Therapy Association. (2002). Occupational therapy practice framework: Domain and process. American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 56, 609‚Äì639. Further exploration of the relationship between occupational therapy and the components of the ICIDH-2 (revision of the original International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps (ICIDH), which later became the ICF) was conducted by McLaughlin Gray. It is noted in the literature that occupational therapists should use specific occupational therapy vocabulary along with the ICF in order to ensure correct communication about specific concepts. The ICF might lack certain categories to describe what occupational therapists need to communicate to clients and colleagues. It also may not be possible to exactly match the connotations of the ICF categories to occupational therapy terms. The ICF is not an assessment and specialized occupational therapy terminology should not be replaced with ICF terminology. The ICF is an overarching framework for current therapy practices.  Global occupational therapy  Occupational therapy is practiced around the world and can be translated in practice to many different cultures and environments. The construct of occupation is shared throughout the profession regardless of country, culture and context. Occupation and the active participation in occupation is now seen as a human right and is asserted as a strong influence in health and well-being. As the profession grows there is a lot of people who are travelling across countries to work as occupational therapists for better work or opportunities. Under this context, every occupational therapist is required to adapt to a new culture, foreign to their own. Understanding cultures and its communities are crucial to occupational therapy ethos. Effective occupational therapy practice includes acknowledging the values and social perspectives of each client and their families. Harnessing culture and understanding what is important to the client is truly a faster way towards independence. The World Federation of Occupational Therapists is an international voice of the profession and is a membership network of occupational therapists worldwide. WFOT supports the international practice of occupational therapy through collaboration across countries. WFOT currently includes over 100 member country organizations, 550,000 occupational therapy practitioners, and 900 approved educational programs. The profession celebrates World Occupational Therapy Day on the 27th of October annually to increase visibility and awareness of the profession, promoting the profession's development work at a local, national and international platform. WFOT has been in close collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) since 1959, working together in programmes that aim to improve world health. WFOT supports the vision for healthy people, in alignment with the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which focuses on \\"ending poverty, fighting inequality and injustice, tackling climate change and promoting health\\". Occupational therapy is a major player in enabling individuals and communities to engage in \\"chosen and necessary occupations\\" and in \\"the creation of more meaningful lives\\".

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, Canada, from 1987 to 1999 in the electoral district of Rainy River, and from 1999 to 2011 in the redistributed electoral district of Kenora‚ÄîRainy River. A member of the Ontario New Democratic Party, he was also the party's leader from 1996 to 2009. Hampton retired from the legislature at the 2011 Ontario provincial election and subsequently joined Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP as a member of the law firm's corporate social responsibility and aboriginal affairs groups. His wife, Shelley Martel, was also an MPP until 2007, representing Nickel Belt.George Hampton, Ontario NDP leader's father, dies of heart attack, Niagara Falls Review (ON). Canada, Wednesday, January 4, 2006, p. A8. accessed on October 6, 2006. Early life, education, and early career Hampton was born in Fort Frances, Ontario to a blue collar family, George (April 17, 1928 - January 2, 2006) and Elsie (b. November 8, 1931) Hampton.Howard Hampton's father dies, Barrie Examiner (ON). News, Wednesday, January 4, 2006, p. A8. accessed on October 6, 2006. He was a good student, but also athletically gifted and politically active. He first joined the NDP when he was a teenager. Hampton took an undergraduate degree in philosophy and religion from Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, where he played for the school's Division I NCAA ice hockey team. He later obtained a degree in education from the University of Toronto and a law degree from the University of Ottawa. He worked as a lawyer for the Canadian Labour Congress, and for the provincial NDP government of Allan Blakeney in Saskatchewan. Enters provincial politics Hampton sought election to the Ontario legislature under the NDP banner in the 1977 provincial election, placing third against incumbent Liberal Pat Reid and Progressive Conservative Gordon Armstrong in Rainy River. He ran for the riding again in the 1985 provincial election, and lost to Progressive Conservative candidate Jack Pierce by 278 votes. Cabinet minister Hampton was elected to Queen's Park on his third attempt, in the provincial election of 1987. He was re-elected in the 1990 provincial election, in which the NDP won a majority government. On October 1, 1990, he was appointed Attorney General in the government of Bob Rae. By all accounts, Hampton and Rae were not cabinet allies. Hampton disapproved of many of the Rae government's centrist policies; in particular, he opposed Rae's decision to retreat from an election pledge to introduce public automobile insurance in the province. Journalist Thomas Walkom has argued that Rae deliberately undermined Hampton's control over the Attorney General's office, staffing the ministry with bureaucrats to which he was ideologically incompatible. However, Walkom has also noted that Hampton supported Rae's decision to impose a Social Contract of wage restraints and cost-saving measures on Ontario public servants. Following a cabinet shuffle on February 3, 1993, Hampton was demoted to Minister of Natural Resources, responsible for Native Affairs. Marion Boyd replaced him as Attorney General. The NDP was defeated in the provincial election of 1995, and Hampton was re-elected over Progressive Conservative Lynn Beyak by only 205 votes. =Cabinet posts= Ontario NDP Leader Howard Hampton at Queen's Park addressing CUPE 3903 members protesting against back to work legislation during a York University strike After Rae retired from provincial politics, Hampton became the leader of the NDP on June 22, 1996, beating Frances Lankin, who was seen as a Rae ally and whom many had considered the front-runner, on the third ballot. Leadership candidate Peter Kormos and his support generally went to Hampton rather than Lankin, which was seen as important to Hampton's victory. Tony Silipo also ran for the leadership and would become Hampton's Deputy Leader until 1999. In the 1999 Ontario election, some progressives and union leaders, who had been a crucial source of NDP support before 1995, attempted to defeat Mike Harris, the Progressive Conservative premier, by abandoning the NDP for the Liberals. This tactical voting, commonly called \\"strategic voting,\\" did not succeed in ousting the Harris government, but nearly decimated the NDP, as they took just nine seats and 12 per cent of the popular vote in their worst election showing since the 1950s. As Hampton was not judged to have been at fault, he stayed on as leader. Hampton himself faced a challenging re- election; the Harris government had reduced the number of ridings in Ontario from 130 to 103, and Hampton faced off against Frank Miclash, the Liberal MPP for the adjoining Kenora riding, in the amalgamated riding of Kenora-Rainy River. Hampton defeated Miclash by 3,000 votes. Howard Hampton shares the stage at Mohamed Boudjenane's nomination meeting with fellow NDP politicians and candidates. Pictured from left to right; Rosario Marchese, MPP Trinity‚ÄìSpadina; Mohamed Boudjenane, provincial candidate for Etobicoke North; Howard Hampton, Ontario NDP Leader; and Ali Naqvi, federal NDP candidate for Etobicoke North.July 9, 2007. Hampton endorsed Bill Blaikie in the latter's unsuccessful bid for the federal New Democratic Party leadership in 2002. This decision was unpopular with some other members of his caucus, including Deputy Leader Marilyn Churley who was a leading supporter of Jack Layton. In Harris' second term, the government unveiled plans to privatize the public electricity utility, Ontario Hydro. Hampton quickly distinguished himself as an advocate of maintaining public ownership of the utility, and published a book on the subject, Public Power, in 2003. Harris' successor as premier, Ernie Eves, ultimately reached the decision not to sell the hydro utility. Hampton and the NDP won only seven seats in the 2003 Ontario election, losing official party status for the first time since 1963. However, Hampton retained his seat and the party increased its share of the popular vote by 2 per cent. After intense lobbying to lower the minimum number of seats for party status, a compromise was reached which allowed additional funding for the NDP and more inquiry opportunities during Question Period. Ultimately, this controversy was all for nought as on May 13, 2004, the NDP regained official party status in a by- election in Hamilton East, where city councillor Andrea Horwath was elected to fill the vacancy left by the death of Liberal member Dominic Agostino. When Marilyn Churley resigned her Toronto‚ÄîDanforth seat in May 2005, the NDP was granted official party status at first until the by-election, and then until the 2007 provincial election; NDP candidate Peter Tabuns won the seat. The Ontario NDP increased its seat count to nine in September 2006, when well- known local United Church minister Cheri DiNovo won a byelection. The seat became vacant when Liberal MPP Gerard Kennedy resigned to seek the Liberal Party of Canada leadership. Hampton launched the Ontario NDP's 2007 provincial election campaign at the party's Fresh Ideas New Energy January 2007 policy convention. Hampton's keynote speech focused on the party's campaign to raise the minimum wage to $10 an hour, and signalled the NDP's renewed focus on matters of economic justice.Kerry Gillespie, \\"NDP leader wants $10 wage vote \\", Toronto Star, January 28, 2007 The NDP also unveiled a new logo and look.Canada News Wire, \\"Ontario's NDP moves forward with confidence, new look \\", January 26, 2007 Hampton's NDP increased its seat count to 10 in February 2007, when businessman and community activist Paul Ferreira defeated star Liberal candidate Laura Albanese in a byelection in the Toronto riding of York South-Weston. The seat became vacant when Liberal cabinet minister Joe Cordiano resigned. The NDP's campaign for the $10 minimum wage and its opposition to a controversial 25 per cent pay raise for MPPs were cited as key factors in the upset win.Rob Ferguson, \\"NDP pulls upset\\", Toronto Star, February 8, 2007 Despite several encouraging opinion polls that predicted a gain of several seats, Hampton's NDP failed to increase its seat count beyond 10 in the 2007 provincial election. While there was speculation following the election that he may retire, Hampton announced at the November 24, 2007, NDP provincial council that he was staying as party leader.Jared Stuffco, \\"Hampton to stay at NDP helm\\", Toronto Star, November 25, 2007 He announced in April 2008 that he was considering his political future, and would make an announcement later in 2008 as to whether or not he would stay on further as the party leader.\\"NDP leader says he will soon reveal his political future\\", Canadian Press, April 5, 2008. On June 14, 2008, Hampton announced that he would not stand for re-election as party leader at the March 2009 party convention.Keith Leslie, \\"Hampton to step down as NDP leader: Sources\\", Toronto Star. June 13, 2008. He remained an MPP for the remainder of his parliamentary mandate, but did not run in the October 6, 2011 general election. Recent career Hampton currently lives in Toronto with his wife Shelley and children Jonathon and Sarah. He maintains a summer residence on Rainy Lake in Fort Frances. After leaving politics, Hampton worked for several years for the Toronto law firm Fasken Martineau. In November 2014, Hampton was appointed as a consultant to federal NDP leader Thomas Mulcair on the Northern Ontario Ring of Fire mining development. After several months of being encouraged by the party to run as its candidate in Kenora against federal Natural Resources minister Greg Rickford, Hampton announced that he would seek the party's nomination in the riding for the October 19, 2015 federal election; he subsequently won the nomination. The federal riding includes much of Hampton's old provincial riding. Hampton finished second behind the Liberal candidate, former MP and cabinet minister Bob Nault, pushing Rickford into third place.

Dana Meadows with Mount Dana in the background. The Dana Meadows can be found at the eastern entrance to Yosemite National Park, at the foot of Mount Dana, not far from Tuolumne Meadows and the Tioga Pass entrance station.  Description  The Dana Fork of the Tuolumne River originates adjacent to the meadows, and flows west through them towards its junction with the Lyell Fork of the Tuolumne River. At an altitude of 9,728 feet (2,965 m), the meadow can be covered in snow up to 162 inches (411 cm) deep in wintertime. In June or July, it is springtime in these meadows, but snow can come at any time, especially after 1 September. Before Yosemite became a park, Basque sheepherders would graze their flocks here, and in other areas of the Sierra Nevada. Often lonely, they would carve their initials into the trees of the meadow, several of which are still visible. (In hunting season, some animals of the Sierra, such as the deer, have learned to migrate into the park.)

It conducts research and education in the social sciences, primarily in economics (and tax policy), metropolitan policy, governance, foreign policy, global economy, and economic development. Its stated mission is to \\"provide innovative and practical recommendations that advance three broad goals: strengthen American democracy; foster the economic and social welfare, security and opportunity of all Americans; and secure a more open, safe, prosperous, and cooperative international system.\\" Brookings has five research programs at its Washington, D.C. campus (Economic Studies, Foreign Policy, Governance Studies, Global Economy and Development, and Metropolitan Policy) and three international centers based in Doha, Qatar (Brookings Doha Center); Beijing, China (Brookings-Tsinghua Center for Public Policy); and New Delhi, India (Brookings India). The University of Pennsylvania's Global Go To Think Tank Index Report has named Brookings \\"Think Tank of the Year\\" and \\"Top Think Tank in the World\\" every year since 2008. The Economist describes Brookings as \\"perhaps America‚Äôs most prestigious think-tank.\\" Brookings states that its staff \\"represent diverse points of view\\" and describes itself as non-partisan, and various media outlets have alternately described Brookings as centrist or liberal. An academic analysis of Congressional records from 1993 to 2002 found that Brookings was referred to by conservative politicians almost as frequently as liberal politicians, earning a score of 53 on a 1‚Äì100 scale with 100 representing the most liberal score. The same study found Brookings to be the most frequently cited think tank by the U.S. media and politicians. History =1916‚Äì79= Founder Robert S. Brookings (1850‚Äì1932) Brookings was founded in 1916 as the Institute for Government Research (IGR), with the mission of becoming \\"the first private organization devoted to analyzing public policy issues at the national level.\\" The Institution's founder, a philanthropist Robert S. Brookings (1850‚Äì1932), originally created the formation of three organizations: the Institute for Government Research, the Institute of Economics (with funds from the Carnegie Corporation), and the Robert Brookings Graduate School affiliated with Washington University in St. Louis. The three were merged into the Brookings Institution on December 8, 1927. During the Great Depression, economists at Brookings embarked on a large-scale study commissioned by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to understand the underlying causes of the depression. Brookings's first president Harold Moulton and other Brookings scholars later led an effort to oppose President Roosevelt's National Recovery Administration because they thought the NRA was impeding economic recovery. With the entry into World War II in 1941, Brookings researchers turned their attention to aiding the administration with a series of studies on mobilization. In 1948, Brookings was asked to submit a plan for the administration of the European Recovery Program. The resulting organization scheme assured that the Marshall Plan was run carefully and on a businesslike basis. In 1952, Robert Calkins succeeded Moulton as president of the Brookings Institution. He secured grants from the Rockefeller Foundation and the Ford Foundation that put the Institution on a strong financial basis. He reorganized the Institution around the Economic Studies, Government Studies, and Foreign Policy Programs. In 1957, the Institution moved from Jackson Avenue to a new research center near Dupont Circle in Washington, D.C. Kermit Gordon assumed the presidency of Brookings in 1967. He began a series of studies of program choices for the federal budget in 1969 entitled \\"Setting National Priorities\\". He also expanded the Foreign Policy Studies Program to include research in national security and defense. After the election of Richard Nixon to the presidency in 1968, the relationship between the Brookings Institution and the White House deteriorated; at one point Nixon's aide Charles Colson proposed a firebombing of the Institution. Yet throughout the 1970s, Brookings was offered more federal research contracts than it could handle. =1980‚Äì2017= Russian President Dmitry Medvedev at Brookings on 14 April 2010 while on a visit to the United States for the 2010 Nuclear Security Summit. Jos√© Mar√≠a Figueres, former President of Costa Rica, speaking at Brookings Institution By the 1980s, the Institution faced an increasingly competitive and ideologically charged intellectual environment. The need to reduce the federal budget deficit became a major research theme as well as investigating problems with national security and government inefficiency. Bruce MacLaury, fourth president of Brookings, also established the Center for Public Policy Education to develop workshop conferences and public forums to broaden the audience for research programs. In 1995, Michael Armacost became the fifth president of the Brookings Institution and led an effort to refocus the Institution's mission heading into the 21st century. Under Armacost's direction, Brookings created several interdisciplinary research centers, such as the Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy (now the Metropolitan Policy Program, led by Bruce J. Katz), which brought attention to the strengths of cities and metropolitan areas; and the Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies, which brings together specialists from different Asian countries to examine regional problems. Strobe Talbott became president of Brookings in 2002. Shortly thereafter, Brookings launched the Saban Center for Middle East Policy and the John L. Thornton China Center. In October 2006, Bookings announced the establishment of the Brookings-Tsinghua Center in Beijing. In July 2007, the Institution announced the creation of the Engelberg Center for Health Care Reform to be directed by senior fellow Mark McClellan, and then in October 2007, the creation of the Brookings Doha Center directed by fellow Hady Amr in Qatar. During this period the funding of Brookings by foreign governments and corporations came under public scrutiny (see Funding controversies below). In 2011, Brookings President Strobe Talbott inaugurated the Brookings India Office. In October 2017, former general John R. Allen became the seventh president of Brookings. As of June 30, 2019, Brookings had an endowment of $377.2 million. Publications Brookings as an institution produces an Annual Report. The Brookings Institution Press publishes books and journals from the institution's own research as well as authors outside the organization. The books and journals they publish include Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Brookings Review (1982‚Äì2003, ), America Unbound: The Bush Revolution in Foreign Policy, Globalphobia: Confronting Fears about Open Trade, India: Emerging Power, Through Their Eyes, Taking the High Road, Masses in Flight, US Public Policy Regarding Sovereign Wealth Fund Investment in the United States and Stalemate to name a few. In addition, books, papers, articles, reports, policy briefs and opinion pieces are produced by Brookings research programs, centers, projects and, for the most part, by experts. Brookings also cooperates with the Lawfare Institute in publishing the Lawfare blog. Policy influence Brookings traces its history back to 1916 and has contributed to the creation of the United Nations, the Marshall Plan, and the Congressional Budget Office, as well as to the development of influential policies for deregulation, broad-based tax reform, welfare reform, and foreign aid. The annual think tank index published by Foreign Policy ranks it the number one think tank in the U.S. and the Global Go To Think Tank Index believes it is the number one such tank in the world. Moreover, in spite of an overall decline in the number of times information or opinions developed by think tanks are referred to by the US media, of the 200 most prominent think tanks in the U.S., the Brookings Institution's research remains the most frequently cited. In a 1997 survey of congressional staff and journalists, Brookings ranked as the first-most influential and first in credibility among 27 think tanks considered. Yet \\"Brookings and its researchers are not so concerned, in their work, in affecting the ideological direction of the nation\\" and rather tend \\"to be staffed by researchers with strong academic credentials\\". Along with the Council on Foreign Relations and Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Brookings is generally considered one of the most influential policy institutes in the U.S. Political stance As a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, Brookings describes itself as independent and non-partisan. A 2005 academic study by UCLA concluded it was \\"centrist\\" because it was referenced as an authority almost equally by both conservative and liberal politicians in congressional records from 1993 to 2002. The New York Times has referred to the organization as liberal, liberal-centrist, and centrist. The Washington Post has described Brookings as centrist and liberal. The Los Angeles Times has described Brookings as liberal-leaning and centrist before opining that it did not believe such labels mattered. In 1977, Time magazine described it as the \\"nation's pre-eminent liberal think tank\\". Newsweek has described Brookings as centrist while Politico has used the term \\"center-left\\". The media watchdog group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, which describes itself as \\"progressive\\", has described Brookings as \\"centrist\\", \\"conservative\\", and \\"center-right\\". Journalists at The Atlantic and Salon have argued that Brookings foreign policy scholars were overly supportive of Bush administration policies abroad. Blogger Matthew Yglesias has stated that Brookings's Michael E. O'Hanlon frequently agrees with scholars from conservative organizations such as the American Enterprise Institute, The Weekly Standard, and the Project for the New American Century. Similarly, Brookings fellow and research director Benjamin Wittes is a member of the conservative Hoover Institution's Task Force on National Security and Law. Brookings scholars have served in Republican and Democratic administrations, including Mark McClellan, Ron Haskins and Martin Indyk. The Brookings Board of Trustees is composed of 53 Trustees and more than three dozen Honorary Trustees, including Kenneth Duberstein, a former chief of staff to Ronald Reagan. Aside from political figures, the board of trustees includes leaders in business and industry, including Philip H. Knight, Chairman of Nike, Inc, Robert Bass, Hanzade Doƒüan Boyner, Paul L. Cejas, W. Edmund Clark, Abby Joseph Cohen, Betsy Cohen, Susan Crown, Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr., Jason Cummins, Paul Desmarais Jr., Kenneth M. Duberstein, Glenn Hutchins. Starting with the 1990 election cycle, employees of the Brookings Institution gave $853,017 to Democratic candidates and $26,104 to Republican candidates. In total, since 1990, 96 percent of its political donations have gone to Democrats. Notable scholars Notable Brookings scholars include former Federal Reserve chairs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke; former Federal Reserve vice chairs Donald Kohn, Alice Rivlin, and Alan Blinder; former chairmen of the president's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) Jason Furman and Martin Neil Baily; former CEA members Sandra Black, Jay Shambaugh, and James H. Stock; dean of the University of Michigan's Ford School of Public Policy Susan M. Collins; former director of the Congressional Budget Office Douglas Elmendorf; former Assistant Secretary of State Martin S. Indyk; former US Secretary of Education Arne Duncan; former Federal Communications Commission chairman Tom Wheeler; Washington Post columnist E. J. Dionne;, Wall Street Journal columnist William Galston, and former NSC official Fiona Hill.

The Center seeks to produce research in areas of fundamental importance for China's development and for US-China relations. The BTC was directed by Qi Ye until 2019. =21st Century Defense Initiative= Adm. Michael Mullen speaks at the Brookings Institution The 21st Century Defense Initiative (21CDI) is aimed at producing research, analysis, and outreach that address three core issues: the future of war, the future of U.S. defense needs and priorities, and the future of the US defense system. The Initiative draws on the knowledge from regional centers, including the Center on the United States and Europe, the Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies, the Thornton China Center, and the Center for Middle East Policy, allowing the integration of regional knowledge. P. W. Singer, author of Wired for War, serves as Director of the 21st Century Defense Initiative, and Michael O'Hanlon serves as Director of Research. Senior Fellow Stephen P. Cohen and Vanda Felbab-Brown are also affiliated with 21CDI. =WashU at Brookings= Under Brookings President Bruce MacLaury's leadership in the 1980s, the Center for Public Policy Education (CPPE) was formed to develop workshop conferences and public forums to broaden the audience for research programs. In 2005, the Center has renamed the Brookings Center for Executive Education (BCEE), which was shortened to Brookings Executive Education (BEE) with the launch of a partnership with the Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis.

Thornton. Funding details as of 2017: =Funding controversies= An investigation by The New York Times, reported on September 6, 2014, found the Brookings Institution to be among more than a dozen Washington research groups to have received payments from foreign governments while encouraging U.S. officials to encourage support for policies aligned with those foreign governments' agenda. The New York Times published documents showing that Brookings Institution accepted grants from Norway with specific policy requests and helped the country gain access to U.S. government officials, as well as other \\"deliverables\\". In June 2014, Norway agreed to make an additional $4 million donation to Brookings. Several legal specialists who examined the documents told the paper that the language of the transactions \\"appeared to necessitate Brookings filing as a foreign agent\\" under the Foreign Agent Registration Act. The Qatari government was named by The New York Times as \\"the single biggest foreign donor to Brookings\\", having reportedly made a $14.8 million, four-year contribution in 2013. A former visiting fellow at a Brookings affiliate in Qatar reportedly said that \\"he had been told during his job interview that he could not take positions critical of the Qatar government in papers\\". Brookings officials denied any connection between the views of their funders and their scholars' work, citing reports that questioned the Qatari government's education reform efforts and criticized its support of militants in Syria. However, Brookings officials reportedly acknowledged that they meet with Qatari government officials regularly. In 2018, The Washington Post reported that the Brookings Institution accepted funding from Huawei from 2012 to 2018. Buildings The main building of the Institution was erected in 1959 on 1775 Massachusetts Avenue. In 2009, Brookings acquired a building across the street, a former mansion built by the Ingalls family in 1922 on a design by Jules Henri de Sibour. This extension now houses the office of the President of the Brookings Institution.

Finlandia Queen, a paddle-wheel ship from 1990s in Tampere, FinlandPW/S VELLAMO A paddle steamer is a steamship or steamboat powered by a steam engine that drives paddle wheels to propel the craft through the water. In antiquity, paddle wheelers followed the development of poles, oars and sails, where the first uses were wheelers driven by animals or humans. , a Greenock-built American Civil War blockade- running side-wheel steamer In the early 19th century, paddle wheels were the predominant way of propulsion for steam-powered boats. In the late 19th century, paddle propulsion was largely superseded by the screw propeller and other marine propulsion systems that have a higher efficiency, especially in rough or open water. Paddle wheels continue to be used by small, pedal-powered paddle boats and by some ships that operate tourist voyages. The latter are often powered by diesel engines.  Paddle wheels  Left: Riveted steel paddle wheel from a sidewheeler paddle steamer on the lake of Lucerne Right: detail of a steamer The paddle wheel is a large steel framework wheel. The outer edge of the wheel is fitted with numerous, regularly spaced paddle blades (called floats or buckets). The bottom quarter or so of the wheel travels under water. An engine rotates the paddle wheel in the water to produce thrust, forward or backward as required. More advanced paddle-wheel designs feature \\"feathering\\" methods that keep each paddle blade closer to vertical while in the water to increase efficiency. The upper part of a paddle wheel is normally enclosed in a paddlebox to minimise splashing.  Types of paddle steamers  The Nettie Quill, pictured in Alabama in 1906, shows a typical early sternwheeler design. The two types of paddle wheel steamer are stern-wheeler, with a single wheel on the rear, and side-wheeler, with one on each side. Both were used as riverboats in the United States. Some still operate for tourists, for example on the Mississippi River. =Stern- wheeler= Although the first stern-wheelers were invented in Europe, they saw the most service in North America, especially on the Mississippi River. was built at Brownsville, Pennsylvania, in 1814 as an improvement over the less efficient side-wheelers. The second stern-wheeler built, Washington of 1816, had two decks and served as the prototype for all subsequent steamboats of the Mississippi, including those made famous in Mark Twain's book Life on the Mississippi.Life on the Mississippi, by Mark Twain =Side-wheeler= Side- wheelers are used as riverboats and as coastal craft. Though the side wheels and enclosing sponsons make them wider than stern-wheelers, they may be more maneuverable, since they can sometimes move the paddles at different speeds, and even in opposite directions. This extra maneuverability makes side- wheelers popular on the narrower, winding rivers of the Murray‚ÄìDarling system in Australia, where a number still operate. European side-wheelers, such as , connect the wheels with solid drive shafts that limit maneuverability and give the craft a wide turning radius. Some were built with paddle clutches that disengage one or both paddles so they can turn independently. However, wisdom gained from early experience with side-wheelers deemed that they be operated with clutches out, or as solid-shaft vessels. Crews noticed that as ships approached the dock, passengers moved to the side of the ship ready to disembark. The shift in weight, added to independent movements of the paddles, could lead to imbalance and potential capsizing. Paddle tugs were frequently operated with clutches in, as the lack of passengers aboard meant that independent paddle movement could be used safely and the added maneuverability exploited to the full.  Feathering paddle wheel  Morgan's feathering paddle wheel (Steam and the Steam Engine, Evers) In a simple paddle wheel, where the paddles are fixed around the periphery, power is lost due to churning of the water as the paddles enter and leave the water surface. Ideally, the paddles should remain vertical while under water. This ideal can be approximated by use of levers and linkages connected to a fixed eccentric. The eccentric is fixed slightly forward of the main wheel centre. It is coupled to each paddle by a rod and lever. The geometry is designed such that the paddles are kept almost vertical for the short duration that they are in the water.  History  = Western world = Ox-powered Roman paddle wheel boat from a 15th-century copy of De Rebus Bellicis The use of a paddle wheel in navigation appears for the first time in the mechanical treatise of the Roman engineer Vitruvius (De architectura, X 9.5‚Äì7), where he describes multigeared paddle wheels working as a ship odometer. The first mention of paddle wheels as a means of propulsion comes from the fourth‚Äì or fifth-century military treatise De Rebus Bellicis (chapter XVII), where the anonymous Roman author describes an ox-driven paddle-wheel warship: A 15th-century paddlewheel boat powered by crankshafts (Anonymous of the Hussite Wars) Italian physician Guido da Vigevano (circa 1280‚Äì1349), planning for a new crusade, made illustrations for a paddle boat that was propelled by manually turned compound cranks. Paddle boat, by the Italian artist-engineer Taccola, De machinis (1449): The paddles wind a rope fixed to an anchor upstream, thus moving the boat against the current. One of the drawings of the Anonymous Author of the Hussite Wars shows a boat with a pair of paddlewheels at each end turned by men operating compound cranks. The concept was improved by the Italian Roberto Valturio in 1463, who devised a boat with five sets, where the parallel cranks are all joined to a single power source by one connecting rod, an idea adopted by his compatriot Francesco di Giorgio. In 1704, French physicist Denis Papin constructed the first ship powered by his steam engine, mechanically linked to paddles. This made him the first to construct a steam-powered boat (or vehicle of any kind). Then, he poured the first steam cylinder of the world in the iron foundry at Veckerhagen. In 1787, Patrick Miller of Dalswinton invented a double-hulled boat that was propelled on the Firth of Forth by men working a capstan that drove paddles on each side. Model made by de Jouffroy in 1784 to show the French Science Academy the engine and paddle wheels used on : The model is now in the National Maritime Museum in Paris. One of the firsts functioning steamships, Palmip√®de, which was also the first paddle steamer, was built in France in 1774 by Marquis Claude de Jouffroy and his colleagues. The steamer with rotating paddles sailed on the Doubs River in June and July 1776. In 1783, a new paddle steamer by de Jouffroy, , successfully steamed up the river Sa√¥ne for 15 minutes before the engine failed. Bureaucracy and the French Revolution thwarted further progress by de Jouffroy. The next successful attempt at a paddle-driven steam ship was by Scottish engineer William Symington, who suggested steam power to Patrick Miller of Dalswinton. Experimental boats built in 1788 and 1789 worked successfully on Lochmaben Loch. In 1802, Symington built a barge-hauler, , for the Forth and Clyde Canal Company. It successfully hauled two 70-ton barges almost in 6 hours against a strong headwind on test in 1802. Enthusiasm was high, but some directors of the company were concerned about the banks of the canal being damaged by the wash from a powered vessel, and no more were ordered. While Charlotte Dundas was the first commercial paddle steamer and steamboat, the first commercial success was possibly Robert Fulton's Clermont in New York, which went into commercial service in 1807 between New York City and Albany. Many other paddle-equipped river boats followed all around the world. breaking yard in 1838 In 1812, the first U.S. Mississippi River paddle steamer began operating out of New Orleans. By 1814, Captain Henry Shreve had developed a \\"steamboat\\" suitable for local conditions. Landings in New Orleans went from 21 in 1814 to 191 in 1819, and over 1,200 in 1833. The first stern-wheeler was built by Mr. Roentgeres at Rotterdam, and used between Antwerp and Ghent in 1827. Team boats, paddle boats driven by horses, were used for ferries the United States from the 1820s‚Äì1850s, as they were economical and did not incur licensing costs imposed by the steam navigation monopoly. In the 1850s, they were replaced by steamboats. After the American Civil War, as the expanding railroads took many passengers, the traffic became primarily bulk cargoes. The largest, and one of the last, paddle steamers on the Mississippi was the sternwheeler Sprague. Built in 1901, she pushed coal and petroleum until 1948.Dead link January 27, 2018 = China = A Chinese paddle-wheel ship from a Qing Dynasty encyclopedia published in 1726 The first mention of a paddle- wheel ship from China is in the History of the Southern Dynasties, compiled in the 7th century but describing the naval ships of the Liu Song Dynasty (420‚Äì479) used by admiral Wang Zhen'e in his campaign against the Qiang in 418 AD. The ancient Chinese mathematician and astronomer Zu Chongzhi (429‚Äì500) had a paddle-wheel ship built on the Xinting River (south of Nanjing) known as the \\"thousand league boat\\".Needham, Joseph (1965). Science and Civilization in China, Vol. IV: Physics and Physical Technology, p.416. . When campaigning against Hou Jing in 552, the Liang Dynasty (502‚Äì557) admiral Xu Shipu employed paddle-wheel boats called \\"water-wheel boats\\". At the siege of Liyang in 573, the admiral Huang Faqiu employed foot-treadle powered paddle-wheel boats. A successful paddle-wheel warship design was made in China by Prince Li Gao in 784 AD, during an imperial examination of the provinces by the Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907) emperor. The Chinese Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279) issued the construction of many paddle-wheel ships for its standing navy, and according to the British biochemist, historian, and sinologist Joseph Needham: > \\"...between 1132 and 1183 (AD) a great number of treadmill-operated paddle- > wheel craft, large and small, were built, including sternwheelers and ships > with as many as 11 paddle-wheels a side,\\".Needham, 476 The standard Chinese term \\"wheel ship\\" was used by the Song period, whereas a litany of colorful terms were used to describe it beforehand. In the 12th century, the Song government used paddle-wheel ships en masse to defeat opposing armies of pirates armed with their own paddle-wheel ships. At the Battle of Caishi in 1161, paddle-wheelers were also used with great success against the Jin Dynasty (1115‚Äì1234) navy. The Chinese used the paddle-wheel ship even during the First Opium War (1839‚Äì1842) and for transport around the Pearl River during the early 20th century.  Seagoing paddle steamers  , the last seagoing paddle steamer The first seagoing trip of a paddle steamer was by the Albany in 1808. It steamed from the Hudson River along the coast to the Delaware River. This was purely for the purpose of moving a river-boat to a new market, but paddle-steamers began regular short coastal trips soon after. In 1816 Pierre Andriel, a French businessman, bought in London the paddle steamer Margery (later renamed Elise) and made an eventful London-Le Havre-Paris crossing, encountering heavy weather on the way. He later operated his ship as a river packet on the Seine, between Paris and Le Havre. The first paddle-steamer to make a long ocean voyage crossing the Atlantic Ocean was , built in 1819 expressly for this service. Savannah set out for Liverpool on May 22, 1819, sighting Ireland after 23 days at sea. This was the first powered crossing of the Atlantic, although Savannah was built as a sailing ship with a steam auxiliary; she also carried a full rig of sail for when winds were favorable, being unable to complete the voyage under power alone. In 1822, Charles Napier's , the world's first iron ship, made the first direct steam crossing from London to Paris and the first seagoing voyage by an iron ship. Commodore Perry's fleet: either or In 1838, , a fairly small steam packet built for the Cork to London route, became the first vessel to cross the Atlantic under sustained steam power, beating Isambard Kingdom Brunel's much larger by a day. Great Western, however, was actually built for the transatlantic trade, and so had sufficient coal for the passage; Sirius had to burn furniture and other items after running out of coal.Men of Iron : Brunel, Stephenson and the Inventions That Shaped the Modern World by Sally Dugan Great Westerns more successful crossing began the regular sailing of powered vessels across the Atlantic. was the first coastal steamship to operate in the Pacific Northwest of North America. Paddle steamers helped open Japan to the Western World in the mid-19th century. The largest paddle-steamer ever built was Brunel's , but it also had screw propulsion and sail rigging. It was long and weighed 32,000 tons, its paddlewheels being in diameter. In oceangoing service, paddle steamers became much less useful after the invention of the screw propeller, but they remained in use in coastal service and as river tugboats, thanks to their shallow draught and good maneuverability. The last crossing of the Atlantic by paddle steamer began on September 18, 1969, to conclude six months and nine days later. The steam paddle tug was never intended for oceangoing service, but was steamed from Newcastle to San Francisco. As the voyage was intended to be completed under power, the tug was rigged as steam propelled with a sail auxiliary. The transatlantic stage of the voyage was completed exactly 150 years after the voyage of Savannah.  Paddle-driven steam warships  Matthew C. Perry's paddle frigate , part of the Black Ships expedition to Japan (1853‚Äì1854) Beginning in the 1820s, the British Royal Navy began building paddle-driven steam frigates and steam sloops. By 1850 these had become obsolete due to the development of the propeller ‚Äì which was less vulnerable to cannon fire. However, paddle warships were used extensively by the Russian Navy during the Crimean War of 1853‚Äì1856, and by the United States Navy during the Mexican War of 1846‚Äì1848 and the American Civil War of 1861‚Äì1865. With the arrival of ironclad battleships from the late 1850s, the last remaining paddle frigates were decommissioned and sold into merchant-navy service by the 1870s. These included , which became one of the first Boston steamers in 1867.

Paddle wheelers are still in operation on some lakes in Southern Bavaria, such as Diessen () on Ammersee, built in 1908 and converted to a diesel system in 1975. It has been completely rebuilt in 2006. As paddle wheelers have proven to be such a great tourist attraction, a new one was even built in 2002 on Ammersee, Herrsching, but it has never been powered by steam. On lake Chiemsee, RMS Ludwig Fessler () is still in regular service. It was built in 1926, but is now also powered by diesel engines (since 1973). The original diesel engine was the last ship engine being built by Maffei (no. 576). This engine has ended up in Switzerland to drive the newly renovated Neuch√¢tel, launched in 2013. = Bangladesh = The era of paddle steamers in Bangladesh began in 1929 during the British colonial rule. At that time, there were many paddle steamers built by British Government for travel facilities as Bangladesh (Eastern Bengal at that time) is a riverine country. These paddle steamers are also known as Rocket Steamers because at that time these paddle steamers were the fastest water vesssel. Now there are 4 paddle steamers on service. They are PS Mahsud (Built: 1929), PS Ostrich (Built: 1929), PS Tern (Built: 1937) and PS Lepcha (Built: 1948-49). PS Mahsud and PS Ostrich are the biggest paddle steamer. These paddle steamers run in the route of Dhaka- Chandpur-Barisal-Morrelganj. These paddle steamers are controlled & superintend by Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation (BIWTC). These paddle steamers are 100 years of heritage of Bangladesh. = Austria = Steam paddler Hohentwiel in Bregenz, Lake Constance Franz Josef I. on Lake Wolfgang In Austria only a small paddle steamer fleet operates.

There are five active and one inactive on Lake Lucerne, two on Lake Zurich, and one each on Lake Brienz, Lake Thun and Lake Constance. Swiss company CGN operates a number of paddle steamers on Lake Geneva. Their fleet includes three converted to diesel electric power in the 1960s and five retaining steam. One, Montreux, was reconverted in 2000 from diesel to an all-new steam engine. It is the world's first electronically remote-controlled steam engine and has operating costs similar to state-of- the-art diesels, while producing up to 90 percent less air pollution.WALLER Roger: MODERN STEAM ‚Äì AN ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL ALTERNATIVE TO DIESEL TRACTION, Institution of Mechanical Engineers, The Sir Seymour Biscoe Tritton Lecture, Pages 9‚Äì10  Active vessels  Lakes of Biel, Morat and Neuch√¢tel (connected by channels): * Neuch√¢tel (built in 1912) Lake Brienz: * L√∂tschberg (1914) Lake Geneva: * Montreux (1904), La Suisse II (1910), Savoie (1914), Simplon (1919), Rh√¥ne III (1927) Lake Lucerne: * Stadt Luzern (1928, last steam ship built for Switzerland), Uri (1901, oldest Swiss paddle wheel steamer), Schiller (1906), Gallia (1913), Unterwalden (1902) SS Montreux outside Lutry, Lake Geneva in August 2018 Lake Thun: * (1906) Lake Zurich: * Stadt Z√ºrich (1909), Stadt Rapperswil (1914) Note: The oldest active Swiss steamship is Greif (1895, on the Greifensee) with screw propulsion. = France = No paddle ship is currently in operation in France as of 2015 (though some Paris sightseeing tourist crafts sport a dummy sternwheel powered by a hydraulic motor). In Lac D'Annecy an almost intact paddle steamer called la France, resting on an even keel, can be visited by advanced divers (resting at deep). She was built, like most of its Swiss counterparts by Escher-Wyss in 1909 (as a CKD dismantled kit to be transported by railway and assembled at the local annecy Puya Shipyard) and ran a regular line around Lac d'Annecy. During World War II the ship was laid up in Annecy and used as a prison by the German occupying forces and the Gestapo. La France made her last commercial voyage in 1965 and then fell into neglect and disrepair. Her owner had moored her some distance from the shore to save quay fees and she sprung an ice related leak and sunk in March 1971. It is a popular site among advanced divers (Level 2-assisted or 3-autonomous CMAS is requested to dive the wreck), an almost intact time capsule due to the fresh and low temperature water. Some divers even (mimic to) play underwater French billiard on the intact billiard table in the main lounge. Any hope of raising the ship is vain though: the hull was badly distorted when hitting the rocky lake bottom. = United Kingdom = , built in 1947, is the last seagoing paddle steamer in the world. This ship sails a full season of cruises from ports around Britain, and sailed across the English Channel to commemorate the sinking of her predecessor of 1899 at the 1940 Battle of Dunkirk. Based at Wareham, (one of the smallest passenger-carrying vessels of her type, with a passenger capacity of only 12) takes trips on the River Frome.

Waimarie was built in kitset form in Poplar, London in 1899, and originally operated on the Whanganui River under the name Aotea. Later renamed, she remained in service until 1949. She sank at her moorings in 1952, and remained in the mud until raised by volunteers and restored to begin operations again in 2000. The 1907 Otunui Paddleboat operated on the Whanganui River until the 1940s in her original form as a tunnel screw riverboat. Lost from her mooring in a flood she was refloated in the late 1960s and rebuilt as a sternwheeled jetboat. Around 1982 she went overland to Lake Okataina and was converted to the sidepaddle vessel as she is today. Currently operating on the Wairoa River at Tauranga, this , diesel powered vessel with hydraulic drive for the paddlewheels offers scenic cruises and charters. = The Netherlands = Kapitein Kok is a paddle steamer built in 1911 for ferry service on the river Lek.

Paddle tugs  is a preserved steam-powered sternwheel tug based in Portland, Oregon, that is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The British Admiralty's Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service constructed a new \\"Director\\" class of diesel-electric paddle tugs as recently as 1957 and 1958. Each paddle wheel was driven by an individual electric motor, giving outstanding maneuverability. Paddle tugs were able to more easily make use of the inherent advantage of side wheel paddle propulsion, having the option to disconnect the clutches that connected the paddle drive shafts as one. This enabled them to turn one paddle ahead and one astern to turn and maneuver quickly.

It is headquartered in Brooklyn and its territory encompasses the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. It is a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of New York. The diocesan cathedral is the Cathedral Basilica of St. James in Downtown Brooklyn and its co-cathedral is the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph in Prospect Heights. The current diocesan bishop is Nicholas Anthony DiMarzio. Brooklyn is one of the few dioceses in the United States that is made up of 100% urban territory.Coen, Joseph W.; McNamara, Patrick, J.; Vaccari, Peter I. Diocese of Immigrants: The Brooklyn Catholic Experience 1853-2003, √âditions du Signe, 2004. . p. 120 The Bishop of the Diocese of Brooklyn, Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio, presides from both the Cathedral Basilica of St. James and the Co- Cathedral of St. Joseph. This atypical arrangement was required due to the small size of the Cathedral Basilica of St. James. St. Joseph's Church was designated as a Co-Cathedral for the Diocese of Brooklyn on February 14, 2013, by Pope Benedict XVI after Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio petitioned the Vatican. History The diocese was established in 1853 out of the territory of the Archdiocese of New York, at a time when Brooklyn was still a separate city from New York City. It originally included all of Long Island, but its present-day territory was established in 1957 when Nassau and Suffolk counties were split to form the Diocese of Rockville Centre.Who We Are,\\" Diocese of Rockville Centre website (accessed 2009-November‚Äì02). The opening of the Brooklyn Navy Yard in 1801 drew a number of immigrants, largely Catholics from Northern Ireland, especially from Derry and Donegal. They would cross the East River to attend services at St. Peter's Church on Barclay Street. Periodically, Rev. John Power or others would come to celebrate Mass at the home of William Purcell or at Dempsey's Blooming Grove Garden on Fulton St. The Church of St. James was erected in 1822. In July, 1841, Father Johann Stephen Raffeiner, from the Tyrol, began the German parish of the Most Holy Trinity on a part of the farm of the old Dutch Meserole family in the Bushwick section. Holy Cross Cemetery was opened in 1849. In 1853, Archbishop John Hughes appointed his vicar-general, Irish-born John Loughlin, former pastor of St. Patrick's on Mulberry St. as bishop of the new diocese. Loughlin chose St. James as his cathedral. During his episcopate, Loughlin founded 120 parishes. Plans to build the larger Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception were deferred in favor of orphanages, schools, and hospitals. He was succeeded in 1892, by Bishop Charles Edward McDonnell, former chancellor of the Archdiocese of New York. The Diocese of Brooklyn served at that time 250,000 Catholics. With the increase in the number of immigrants of various nationalities, McDonnell founded a number of national churches which ministered to parishioners in their own language. To this end, he invited several religious institutes into the diocese, including the Redemptorists, Benedictines, Franciscans (including the Minor Conventuals and Capuchins), Jesuits, Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth, Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart, Daughters of Wisdom, and Sisters of the Holy Infant Jesus.Meehan, Thomas. \\"Diocese of Brooklyn.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 2.

Thomas Edmund Molloy was named the third Bishop of Brooklyn on November 21, 1921. In 1930 Bishop Molloy established the Seminary of the Immaculate Conception. The Diocese of Rockville Centre was split off from Brooklyn April 6, 1957. Ten days later, Bryan Joseph McEntegart became the next Bishop of Brooklyn. He built six high schools, Cathedral Preparatory Seminary, and a hospital. He improved outreach to the growing Hispanic population, he sent priests and religious to study Spanish language and culture. Bishop Francis Mugavero experience as former head Brooklyn's Catholic Charities was reflected in his episcopate. In 1971, Mugavero established the Catholic Migration Office to serve the needs of immigrants and refugees living in Brooklyn and Queens.

Haute cuisine is characterized by the meticulous preparation and careful presentation of food at a high price. Early history Haute cuisine developed out of political and social changes in France. The \\"high\\" cuisine represented a hierarchy in 17th century France as only the privileged could eat it. Haute cuisine distinguished itself from regular French cuisine by what was cooked and served such as foods like tongue and caviar, by serving foods such as fruit out of season, by making it difficult and time-consuming to cook, and by using exotic ingredients not typically found in France. In addition to who was eating haute cuisine and what exactly it consisted of, the term can also be defined by who was making it and how they were doing so. Professionally trained chefs were quintessential to the birth of haute cuisine in France. The extravagant presentations and complex techniques that these chefs were known for required ingredients, time, equipment, and therefore money. For this reason, early haute cuisine was accessible to a small demographic of rich and powerful individuals. Not only were professional chefs responsible for building and shaping haute cuisine, but their role in the cuisine was what differentiated it from regular French cuisine. Haute cuisine was characterized by French cuisine in elaborate preparations and presentations served in small and numerous courses that were produced by large and hierarchical staffs at the grand restaurants and hotels of Europe. The cuisine was very rich and opulent with decadent sauces made out of butter, cream, and flour, the basis for many typical French sauces that are still used today. The 17th-century chef and writer La Varenne marked a change from cookery known in the Middle Ages, to somewhat lighter dishes, and more modest presentations. In the following century, Antonin Car√™me also published works on cooking, and although many of his preparations today seem extravagant, he simplified and codified an earlier and even more complex cuisine. Cuisine classique Georges Auguste Escoffier is a central figure in the modernisation of haute cuisine as of about 1900, which became known as cuisine classique. These were simplifications and refinements of the early work of Car√™me, Jules Gouff√© and Urbain Dubois. It was practised in the grand restaurants and hotels of Europe and elsewhere for much of the 20th century. The major developments were to replace service √† la fran√ßaise (serving all dishes at once) with service √† la russe (serving meals in courses) and to develop a system of cookery, based on Escoffier's Le Guide Culinaire, which formalized the preparation of sauces and dishes. In its time, it was considered the pinnacle of haute cuisine, and was a style distinct from cuisine bourgeoise (the cuisine of affluent city dwellers), the working-class cuisine of bistros and homes, and cuisines of the French provinces. A Jacques Lameloise (a three-star Michelin Guide chef) nouvelle cuisine presentation Nouvelle cuisine The 1960s were marked by the appearance of nouvelle cuisine, as chefs rebelled from Escoffier's \\"orthodoxy\\" and complexity. Although the term nouvelle cuisine had been used in the past, the modern usage can be attributed to authors Andr√© Gayot,Andr√© Gayot, \\"Of Stars and Tripes: The True Story of Nouvelle Cuisine\\" Henri Gault, and Christian Millau, who used nouvelle cuisine to describe the cooking of Paul Bocuse, Alain Chapel, Jean and Pierre Troisgros, Michel Gu√©rard, Roger Verg√© and Raymond Oliver, many of whom were once students of Fernand Point.Mennel, Stephan. All Manners of Food: eating and taste in England and France from the Middle Ages to the present. 2nd ed., (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1996), 163-164. In general, nouvelle cuisine puts an emphasis on natural flavours, so the freshest possible ingredients are used, preparation is simplified, heavy sauces are less common, as are strong marinades for meat, and cooking times are often reduced. Nouvelle cuisine was a movement towards conceptualism and minimalism and was a direct juxtaposition to earlier haute cuisine styles of cooking, which were much more extravagant. While menus were increasingly short, dishes used more inventive pairings and relied on inspiration from regional dishes. Within 20 years, however, chefs began returning to the earlier style of haute cuisine, although many of the new techniques remained.

He is also head of the ruling Patriotic Salvation Movement. D√©by is of the Bidyat clan of the Zaghawa ethnic group. He took power at the head of a rebellion against President Hiss√®ne Habr√© in December 1990 and has since survived various rebellions against his own rule. He won elections in 1996 and 2001, and after term limits were eliminated he won again in 2006, 2011, and 2016. He added \\"Itno\\" to his surname in January 2006. He is a graduate of Muammar Gaddafi's World Revolutionary Center. D√©by's multi-decade rule has been described as authoritarian by several international media sources. Youth and military career D√©by was born in the village of Berdoba, approximately 190 kilometers from Fada in northern Chad. His father was a poor herder, who belongs to the Bidayat clan of the Zaghawa community. After attending the Qur'anic School in Tin√©, he continued his studies at the √âcole Fran√ßaise in Fada and later at Franco-Arab school (Lyc√©e Franco-Arabe) in Ab√©ch√©. He also attended the Lyc√©e Jacques Moudeina in Bongor and also holds a bachelor's degree in Science. After finishing school, he entered the Officers' School in N'Djamena. From there he was sent to France for training, returning to Chad in 1976 with a professional pilot certificate. He remained loyal to the army and to President F√©lix Malloum even after the country's central authority crumbled in 1979. He returned from France in February 1979 and found the country had become a battleground for many armed groups. D√©by tied his fortunes to those of Hiss√®ne Habr√©, one of the chief Chadian warlords. A year after Habr√© became President in 1982, D√©by was made commander-in-chief of the army. He distinguished himself in 1984 by destroying pro-Libyan forces in Eastern Chad. In 1985, Habr√© sent him to Paris to follow a course at the √âcole de Guerre; on his return in 1986, he was made chief military advisor to the Presidency. In 1987, he confronted Libyan forces on the field, with the help of France in the so- called \\"Toyota War\\", adopting tactics that inflicted heavy losses on enemy forces. During the war, he also led a raid on Maaten al-Sarra Air Base in Kufrah, which located in Libyan territory. A rift emerged on 1 April 1989 between Habr√© and D√©by over the increasing power of the Presidential Guard. According to Human Rights Watch, Habr√© was found responsible for \\"widespread political killings, systematic torture, and thousands of arbitrary arrests\\", as well as ethnic purges when it was perceived that group leaders could pose a threat to his rule, including many of D√©by's Zaghawa ethnic group who supported the government. Increasingly paranoid, Habr√© accused D√©by, Mahamat Itno, the minister of interior, and Hassan Djamous, commander in chief of the Chadian army of preparing a coup d'√©tat. D√©by first fled to Darfur, and then to Libya, which he was welcomed by Muammar Gaddafi in Tripoli, while Itno and Djamous were arrested and killed. Since all three were ethnic Zaghawa, Habr√© started a targeted campaign against the group which saw hundreds seized, tortured and imprisoned. Dozens died in detention or were summarily executed. In 2016, Habr√© was convicted of war crimes by a specially-created international tribunal in Senegal. Once in Libya, D√©by gave the Libyans detailed information about CIA operations in Chad. Gaddafi offered D√©by military aid to seize power in Chad in exchange with Libyan prisoners of war. D√©by moved to Sudan and formed the Patriotic Salvation Movement, an insurgent group, supported by Libya and Sudan, which started operations against Habr√© in October 1989. He unleashed a decisive attack on 10 November 1990, and on 2 December D√©by's troops marched unopposed into the capital, N'Djam√©na. President of Chad Idriss D√©by assumed Chad's presidency in 1990, and has been re-elected with a majority of votes every five years. = 1990s = After three months of provisional government, on 28 February 1991, a charter was approved for Chad with D√©by as president. During the following two years, D√©by faced a series of coup attempts as government forces clashed with pro-Habr√© rebel groups, such as the Movement for Democracy and Development (MDD). Seeking to quell dissent, in 1992 Chad legalized political parties and held a National Conference which resulted in the gathering of 750 delegates, the government, trade unions and the army to discuss the establishment of a pluralist democracy. However, unrest continued. The Comit√© de Sursaut National pour la Paix et la D√©mocratie (CSNPD), led by Lt. Moise Kette and other southern groups sought to prevent the D√©by government from exploiting oil in the Doba Basin and started a rebellion that left hundreds dead. A peace agreement was reached in 1994, but it broke down shortly. Two new groups, the Armed Forces for a Federal Republic (FARF) led by former Kette ally Laokein Barde, and the Democratic Front for Renewal (FDR), and a reformulated MDD clashed with government forces from 1994 to 1995. D√©by, in the mid-1990s, gradually restored basic functions of government and entered into agreements with the World Bank and IMF to carry out substantial economic reforms. A new constitution was approved by referendum in March 1996, followed by a presidential election in June. D√©by placed on the first round but fell short of a majority; he was then elected president in the second round, held in July, with 69% of the vote.Elections in Chad, African Elections Database. = 2000s = Idriss D√©by was re-elected in the May 2001 presidential election, winning in the first round with 63.17% of the vote, according to official results.\\"Chad: Council releases final polls results; Deby \\"elected\\" with 63.17 per cent\\", Radiodiffusion Nationale Tchadienne (nl.newsbank.com), June 13, 2001.

After days of fighting, the government remained in control of N'Djamena. Speaking at a press conference on February 6, D√©by said that his forces had defeated the rebels, whom he described as \\"mercenaries directed by Sudan\\", and that his forces were in \\"total control\\" of the city as well as the whole country.\\"Chad‚Äôs leader says government ‚Äòin total control‚Äô\\", Associated Press (MSNBC), February 6, 2008.

More than 77% of voters approved. D√©by was a candidate in the 2006 presidential election, held May 3, which was greeted with an opposition boycott. According to official results D√©by won the election with 64.67% of the vote.\\"D√©by win confirmed, but revised down to 64.67 pct\\", IRIN, May 29, 2006. In 2000, with the north/south dispute quelled, D√©by's government started building the country's first oil pipeline, the 1,070 kilometer Chad-Cameroon project. The pipeline was completed in 2003 and praised by the World Bank as \\"an unprecedented framework to transform oil wealth into direct benefits for the poor, the vulnerable and the environment\\". Oil exploitation in the southern Doba region began in June 2000, with World Bank Board approval to finance a small portion of a project, the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development Project, aimed at transport of Chadian crude through a 1000-km buried pipeline through Cameroon to the Gulf of Guinea. The project established unique mechanisms for World Bank, private sector, government, and civil society collaboration to guarantee that future oil revenues benefit populations and result in poverty alleviation. However, with Chad having only a 12.5M stake in the oil field, not much wealth was transferred to the country. In 2006, D√©by made international news after calling for his country to have a 60 percent stake in the Chad-Cameroon oil output after receiving \\"crumbs\\" from foreign companies running the industry. He said Chevron and Petronas were refusing to pay taxes totalling $486.2 million. Chad passed a World Bank-backed oil revenues law that required most of its oil revenue to be allocated to health, education and infrastructure projects. The World Bank had previously frozen an oil revenue account in a dispute over how Chad spent its oil profits.\\"Petronas disputes Chad's tax claims\\" , Aljazeera.net, August 30, 2006. D√©by rejected those claims, arguing that the country does not receive nearly enough royalties to make meaningful change in the fight against poverty. =2010s= On April 25, 2011, D√©by was re-elected for a fourth term with 88.7% of the vote and reappointed Emmanuel Nadingar as Prime Minister. Because of Chad's strategic position in West Africa, Idriss D√©by sent troops or played a key mediating role in tackling the multiple regional crises, such as Darfur, the Central African Republic (CAR), Mali, as well as the fight against Boko Haram. With the security situation in the Central African Republic deteriorating, D√©by decided in 2012 to deploy 400 troops to fight the CAR rebels. In January 2013, Chad also sent 2000 troops to fight Islamist groups in Mali, as part of France's Operation Serval. Chad‚Äôs recent history, under D√©by's leadership, has been characterized by endemic corruption and a deeply entrenched patronage system that permeates society, according to Transparency International. The recent exploitation of oil has fueled corruption, as revenues have been misused by government to strengthen its armed forces and reward its cronies, which contributes to the undermining of the country‚Äôs governance system. In 2006, Chad was placed at the top of the list of the world's most corrupt nations by Forbes magazine, In 2012, D√©by launched a nationwide anticorruption campaign called \\"Operation Cobra,\\" which reportedly recovered some $50 million in embezzled funds. Nongovernmental organizations say, however, that D√©by has used such initiatives to punish rivals and reward cronies. As of 2016, Transparency International ranked Chad 147 out of 168 nations on its corruption index. Faced with a growing threat from Boko Haram, a terrorist group aligned to the Islamic State operating in northern Nigeria, Idriss D√©by increases Chad's participation in the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF), a combined multinational formation comprising units from Niger, Nigeria, Benin and Cameroon. In August 2015, D√©by claims in an interview that the MNJTF has successfully \\"decapited\\" Boko Haram. In January 2016, Idriss D√©by succeeded Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe to become the chairman of the African Union for a one-year term. Upon his inauguration, D√©by told presidents that conflicts around the continent had to end \\"Through diplomacy or by force... We must put an end to these tragedies of our time. We cannot make progress and talk of development if part or our body is sick. We should be the main actors in the search for solution to Africa's crises\\". One of D√©by's first priorities was to accelerate the fight against Boko Haram. On March 4, the African Union agreed to expand the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) to 10 000 troops. During the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris, Idriss D√©by raised the issue of Lake Chad, whose area was a small fraction of what it had been in 1973, and called on the international community to provide financing to protect the ecosystem. In F√©bruary 2016, D√©by was nominated by the Patriotic Salvation Movement to run for a new term in the April 2016 Presidential elections. He pledged to reinstate term limits in the constitution by saying that \\"We must limit terms, we must not concentrate on a system in which a change in power becomes difficult. \\"In 2005 the constitutional reform was conducted in a context where life of the nation was in danger\\". In 2017, the United States Justice Department alleged D√©by accepted a $2 million bribe in return for providing a Chinese company with an opportunity to obtain oil rights in Chad without international competition. In January 2019, D√©by and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the resumption of diplomatic relations between Chad and Israel. Netanyahu described his visit to Chad as ‚Äúpart of the revolution we are having in the Arab and Muslim world.‚ÄùIsraeli PM visits Chad to restore relations. 20.01.2019.

He married Hinda (b. 1977) in September 2005. Reputed for her beauty, this marriage attracted much attention in Chad, and due to tribal affiliations it was seen by many as a strategic means for D√©by to bolster his support while under pressure from rebels.Emily Wax, \\"New First Lady Captivates Chad\\", The Washington Post, May 2, 2006, page A17. Hinda is a member of the Civil Cabinet of the Presidency, serving as Special Secretary.\\"Liste des Membres du Cabinet Civil de la Pr√©sidence de la R√©publique\\", Chadian presidency website (accessed May 4, 2008) . On July 2, 2007, D√©by's son Brahim (age 27) was found dead in the parking garage of his apartment near Paris. According to the autopsy report, he had likely been asphyxiated by white powder from a fire extinguisher. A murder inquiry was launched by the French police. Brahim had been sacked as presidential advisor the year before, after being convicted of possessing drugs and weapons. Blogger Makaila Nguebla attributes the defection of many Chadian government leaders to their indignation over Brahim's conduct: \\"He is at the root of all the frustration.

Museo Glauco Lombardi. Giambattista Bodoni (, ; 26 February 1740 Baptismal register, Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta and San Chiaffredo, Saluzzo, and also on the plaque on Bodoni's birthplace in Saluzzo. in Saluzzo ‚Äì 30 November 1813 in Parma) was an Italian typographer, type-designer, compositor, printer, and publisher in Parma. He first took the type-designs of Pierre Simon Fournier as his exemplars, but afterwards became an admirer of the more modelled types of John Baskerville; and he and Firmin Didot evolved a style of type called \\"Modern,\\" in which the letters are cut in such a way as to produce a strong contrast between the thick and thin parts of their body. Bodoni designed many typefaces, each one in a large range of type sizes. He is even more admired as a compositor than as a type designer, as the large range of sizes which he cut enabled him to compose his pages with the greatest possible subtlety of spacing. Like Baskerville, he sets off his texts with wide margins and uses little or no illustrations or decorations. Bodoni achieved an unprecedented level of technical refinement, allowing him to faithfully reproduce letterforms with very thin \\"hairlines\\", standing in sharp contrast to the thicker lines constituting the main stems of the characters. He became known for his designs of pseudoclassical typefaces and highly styled editions some considered more apt \\"to be admired for typeface and layout, not to be studied or read.\\"Bodoni, Giambattista. Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition [serial online]. January 2009:1-1. Available from: Academic Search Premier, Ipswich, MA. Accessed August 7, 2009. His printing reflected an aesthetic of plain, unadorned style, combined with purity of materials. This style attracted many admirers and imitators, surpassing the popularity of French typographers such as Philippe Grandjean and Pierre Simon Fournier. Bodoni has also had his share of detractors, including William Morris, who felt that his almost mechanical perfection seemed cold and inhumane. There have been several modern revivals of his typefaces, all called Bodoni. They are often used as display faces. Biography =Childhood in Saluzzo (1740-1758)= Saluzzo with Monviso in background Bodoni's birthplace is set in the foothills of the Cottian Alps, in what was then Kingdom of Sardinia, and is now Piedmont. He was the seventh child and fourth son of Francesco Agostino Bodoni and Paola Margherita Giolitti. His father and grandfather were both printers in Saluzzo, and as a child his toys were his grandfather's leftover punches and matrices.Giambattista Bodoni, \\"Notizie intorno a vari incisori di caratteri e sopra alcune getterie d'Italia.\\" MS.ital.222, Biblioth√®que Nationale, Paris. He learned the printing trade working at his father's side, and his gift for wood-engraving and printing was evident very early. So was his ambition and liveliness.Zefirino Campanini,‚ÄúMemorie diverse e intervista di 28 domande e risposte su bodoni e la sua stamperia.‚Äù Catalogo del Museo Bodoniano di Parma. Parma: Artegrafica Silva, 1968, p. 123. At the age of 17 he decided to travel to Rome with the intention of securing fame and fortune as a printer. He left Saluzzo on 8 February 1758.V. Passerini, Memorie aneddote per servire un giorno alla vita del Signor Giovanbattista Bodoni tipografo di sua Maest√† Cattolica e Direttore del Parmense Tipografeo. Parma: Stamperia Carmignani, 1804, p. 9. =Training in Rome (1758-1766)= In Rome, Bodoni found work as an assistant compositor (typesetter) at the press of the Sacra Congregatio de Propaganda Fide (The Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples), the missionary arm of the Vatican. He flourished under the careful supervision of Cardinal Giuseppe Spinelli, the prefect of the Propaganda Fide, and Costantino Ruggieri, the superintendent of the press.Giuseppe de Lama, Vita del Cavaliere Giambattista Bodoni‚Ä¶, Parma, Stamperia Ducale, 1816. One of his first tasks was sorting and cleaning punches in a wide variety of Middle Eastern and Asian languages. Bodoni quickly demonstrated his gift for exotic languages and, as a Pontificale copto-arabo with Bodoni acknowledgement.result, he was sent to study Hebrew and Arabic at ‚ÄúLa Sapienza,‚Äù (Sapienza University of Rome). Bodoni soon became the press's compositor of foreign languages, and began to typeset books. Spinelli and Ruggieri were so delighted with his work on the \\"Pontificale Arabo-Copto\\" that they allowed him to add his name and birthplace to subsequent printings. He then began cutting his own punches. After eight years at the Propaganda Fide press, Bodoni's remarkable skill was renowned, but he was ripe for change. Saddened by the death of Spinelli and Ruggieri's tragic suicide, and encouraged by British friends, he left Rome for England, a country which, under the influence of Baskerville whose books were much admired on the Continent, had become a leader in printing innovation. Bodoni's plan was summarily scotched by sickness; on his journey north, he succumbed to Tertian fever de Lama, p. 9. (malaria), and returned home to Saluzzo to recuperate. =Life and work in Parma (1768-1813)= After convalescing in Saluzzo, Bodoni started working with his father again. Meanwhile, in Parma, the young duke, Don Ferdinando di Borbone (Duke Ferdinand of Parma), and the prime minister, Guillaume du Tillot, were making plans to start a royal press. They wanted someone hardworking and talented to set it up and run it. Father Paolo Maria Paciaudi, the librarian at Parma, who had known Bodoni in Rome, put the young man's name forward. In February 1768, with the permission of Duke Vittorio Amedo III of Savoy, Bodoni left Saluzzo for the court of Parma. He started work right away. The challenge was tremendous; he needed help, so wrote to two of his brothers to come from Saluzzo to assist him. One of them, Giuseppe, remained by his side at the press in Parma for over 30 years. In tandem with Du Tillot, Bodoni acquired everything necessary for a printing business of the highest order: presses, paper, ink, tools, and he ordered type from Fournier in France.Lester, p. 63. He used Fournier's letters for early work published in Parma, gradually replacing it with his own imitations of Fournier, and eventually developing his own style. His first major publication at the royal press was the extravagant volume in celebration of the wedding of the duke of Parma to Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria, \\"Descrizione delle Feste Celebrate in Parma per le Auguste Nozze . . .\\"As an example of its kind, it remains unsurpassed in its beauty and printing technique, and it showed the rest of Europe that the young Italian was a printer to be reckoned with. Several major presentation volumes would follow, along with the various publications required by the court: announcements, invitations, posters, and many sonnets written by those who wished their work to be printed by the great Bodoni. He also began a series of specimen volumes, the first of which, \\"Fregi e majuscule\\" (1771) was in direct imitation of Fournier. His Manuale tipografico of 1788 paved the way for his masterwork, the \\"Manuale tipografico\\" of 1818, published posthumously by his widow. Other cities tried to woo Bodoni away from Parma. Other patrons wished to oust the duke. The most formidable of these was Jos√© Nicol√°s de Azara, the Spanish ambassador to Rome. He felt Bodoni was wasting himself on unimportant work for the duke when he should instead be printing gorgeous editions of the classics. Bodoni was tempted by the offer to move to Rome, but in 1791, when the duke realized the seriousness of the threat, he offered Bodoni his own private press where he could print whatever he wished for whomever he wished. Bodoni had no desire to leave comfortable Parma, where he had just married (at the age of 51) Margherita Dall‚ÄôAglio, a local woman 18 years his junior. He remained in Parma for the rest of his life, running both ducal and private presses, and printing editions of the classics for Azara and other patrons. In the years following 1791, Bodoni produced much of his greatest work, including the great classics of Horace, Virgil, Anacreon, Tasso, and Homer, among others. Napoleon was so delighted with the gift of Bodoni's \\"Iliad\\" that he made him a Chevalier of the Order of the Reunion and gave him a pension for life. The duke of Parma died suddenly and mysteriously in 1802, the duchess fled to Prague, and the French swooped in to fill the vacuum. Bodoni, who lived to work, was apolitical and had no trouble in allying himself with the new r√©gime. His fame became comparable to that of today's rock star. Visitors flocked to his print works on the banks of the river Parma, wanting a glimpse of him working in his studio. Benjamin Franklin, a printer himself, wrote a fan letter. In 1805, even the emperor Napoleon and empress Josephine visited the city and asked to see him; alas, that very day Bodoni was confined to bed with a disastrous attack of gout, a disease that was to plague him until the end of his life. On his trip to Paris to crown Napoleon emperor, Pope Pius VII had been impressed by a copy of Jean-Joseph Marcel's \\"Oratio Dominica,\\" which contained the Lord's Prayer in 150 languages. Visiting Bodoni on his way back to Rome, he challenged him to surpass the Frenchman's achievement. Bodoni took up the challenge, and in 1806 he was able to present the Pope with an \\"Oratio Dominica\\" in 155 languages. Before his death on 30 November 1813, Bodoni had started work on a series of French classics for his new patron, Joachim Murat, Napoleon's brother-in-law. The \\"Th√©atre Complet de Jean Racine\\" was on the press on the day of his death. His favorite title page was the one for \\"Boileau Despr√©aux.\\"Title page. Boileau Despr√©aux. He had to cut the type expressly for the title to fit on one line. It would be up to Bodoni's widow to complete the series. Margherita Dall‚ÄôAglio Bodoni picked up where her husband left off, completed the French classics, and then five years after Bodoni died, published the Manuale typografico of 1818, the specimen book to end all specimen books. Published in two volumes, it was over 600 pages long and contained 265 pages of roman characters, ‚Äúimperceptibly declining in size, romans, italics, and script types, and the series of 125 capital letters; 181 pages of Greek and Oriental characters; 1036 decorations and 31 borders; followed in the last 20 pages by symbols, ciphers, numerals, and musical examples.Quosque tandem . . .

He worked first as a journalist, becoming nationally known for his work with the Saturday Evening Post from 1919 to 1928, and then as a popular novelist. Born in Kennebunk, Maine, Roberts specialized in regionalist historical fiction, often writing about his native state and its terrain and also about other upper New England states and scenes. For example, the main characters in Arundel and Rabble in Arms are from Kennebunkport (then called Arundel), the main character in Northwest Passage is from Kittery, Maine and has friends in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and the main character in Oliver Wiswell is from Milton, Massachusetts. Early life Roberts graduated in 1908 from Cornell University, where he wrote the lyrics for two Cornell fight songs, including Fight for Cornell.Studwell, William Emmett; Schueneman, Bruce R. College Fight Songs II: A Supplementary Anthology. p. 8. He was also a member of the Quill and Dagger society. He was later awarded honorary doctorates from three New England colleges: Dartmouth College, in Hanover, New Hampshire; Colby College, in Waterville, Maine; and Middlebury College, in Middlebury, Vermont.Brennan, Elizabeth; Clarage, Elizabeth (1999). Who's Who of Pulitzer Prize Winners. p. 571. Journalism After graduation, Roberts spent eight years working as a newspaperman for the Boston Post. In 1917, he enlisted in the U.S. army for World War I, but he ended up as a lieutenant in the intelligence section of the American Expeditionary Force Siberia in the Russian Civil War instead of at the front in Europe. The contacts that he made in that role enabled him to become a European correspondent for the Saturday Evening Post after the war, where he became the first American journalist to cover the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch, Adolf Hitler's first attempt to take power. Roberts described working for the Post's legendary editor George Horace Lorimer as follows: \\"I told him my ideas, which he instantly rejected or accepted ... The price to be paid for a story was never discussed, and Lorimer was always generous.\\"Cohn, January (1990). Creating America: George Horace Lorimer and the Saturday Evening Post. University of Pittsburgh Press. p. 282. Historical fiction Booth Tarkington, a neighbor of Roberts in Kennebunkport, Maine, convinced him that he would never find the time to succeed as a novelist while he worked as a journalist, and Tarkington agreed to help by editing Roberts's early novels. Although Roberts continued to sell a few essays to the Post, his next few years were largely dedicated to historical fiction. Ultimately, Tarkington edited all of his historical novels through Oliver Wiswell (1940), and Roberts said in his autobiography that he offered Tarkington co-writing credit on both Northwest Passage and Oliver Wiswell in acknowledgement of Tarkington's extensive revisions to each. Both of those novels and also Rabble in Arms are dedicated to Tarkington, and Tarkington continued to assist Roberts until his death in 1946. Roberts's historical fiction often focused on rehabilitating unpopular persons and causes in American history. A key character in Arundel and Rabble in Arms is the American officer and eventual traitor Benedict Arnold, with Roberts focusing on Arnold's expedition to Quebec and the Battle of Quebec in the first novel and the Battle of Valcour Island, the Saratoga campaign and the Battles of Saratoga in the second. Meanwhile, the hero of Northwest Passage was Major Robert Rogers and his company, Rogers' Rangers, although Rogers fought for the British during the American Revolutionary War. Oliver Wiswell focuses on a Loyalist officer during the American Revolution and covers the entire war, from famous events such as the Siege of Boston, the Battle of Bunker Hill, the New York and New Jersey campaign through the Battle of Fort Washington, and the Franco-American alliance, to less-remembered events such as the Convention Army, the exodus to Kentucky County, the Siege of Ninety-Six, and the resettlement of the United Empire Loyalists, as well as providing a later look at both a dissolute Rogers and a frustrated Arnold among the British. George Orwell reviewed The Lively Lady in the New English Weekly in 1936, describing it as \\"blood-and-thundery stuff ... chiefly interesting as showing that the old-fashioned nineteenth-century type of American bumptiousness ... is still going strong.\\" As a result of his research into the Arnold expedition, Roberts published a work of nonfiction, March to Quebec: Journals of the Members of Arnold's Expedition, a compilation of journals and letters written by participants in the march. During Roberts's research into Major Rogers, his researcher uncovered transcripts of both of Rogers's courts-martial (once as the accuser and once as the accused), which had been thought lost for over a century, and these were published in the second volume of a special two-volume edition of Northwest Passage. He and his wife Anna translated into English the French writer M√©d√©ric Louis √âlie Moreau de Saint-M√©ry's account of his journey through America in the 1790s. His last published work was The Battle of Cowpens, a brief history of that battle, issued after his death, in 1958. One of Lorimer's last acts as editor of the Saturday Evening Post was to serialize Northwest Passage in 1936 and 1937. As a result of the success of the serialization, the book, when published, became the second-best-selling novel in 1937 and fifth best for the year 1938. Oliver Wiswell also spent two years in the top ten (1940 and 1941), and Lydia Bailey reached the top ten in 1947. One of Roberts's closest friends and neighbors, the novelist A. Hamilton Gibbs, later stated that he believed that Roberts probably \\"wrote himself out\\" after Oliver Wiswell and certainly had done so after Lydia Bailey. Key historical novels by Roberts and their topics include the following: *Arundel (1929), on the American Revolution through the Battle of Quebec *The Lively Lady (1931), on the War of 1812 *Rabble in Arms (1933), the sequel to Arundel, on the American Revolution through the Battles of Saratoga *Captain Caution (1934), on the War of 1812 *Northwest Passage (1937), on the French and Indian War and the Jonathan Carver expedition *Oliver Wiswell (1940), on the American Revolution from a Loyalist's perspective, from the Siege of Boston to the United Empire Loyalists *Lydia Bailey (1947), on the Haitian Revolution and the First Barbary War *Boon Island (1955), on a 1710 shipwreck on Boon Island, Maine In 1957, two months before his death, Roberts received a Pulitzer Prize Special Citation \\"for his historical novels which have long contributed to the creation of greater interest in our early American history.\\"\\"Special Awards and Citations\\". The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved 2013-11-02. He died, aged 71, in Kennebunkport. Controversies =Immigration= While a reporter for the Saturday Evening Post in the early 1920s, Roberts wrote many magazine articles and a book during the period immediately following World War I that urged strong legal restrictions on immigration from eastern and southern Europe and from Mexico, warning of the dangers of immigration from places other than northwestern Europe. He became a leading voice for stricter immigration laws and testified before a congressional committee on the subject.Bagger, Eugene S. (May 17, 1922). ‚ÄúEthnology by Ear‚Äù. Book review of Why Europe Leaves Home. New Republic. p. 349. He wrote: :‚ÄúIf America doesn‚Äôt keep out the queer alien mongrelized people of Southern and Eastern Europe, her crop of citizens will eventually be dwarfed and mongrelized in turn.‚ÄùQuoted in Simon, Rita James (1997). In the Golden Land: A Century of Russian and Soviet Jewish Immigration. pp. 15‚Äì16. =Florida land boom= Three of Roberts's first books were written at least in part to promote the Florida land boom of the 1920s. They were Sun Hunting (1922), Florida Loafing (1925), and Florida (1926). Many people lost a lot of money in the bust that followed. These books were usually omitted from the lists of ‚Äúother books by this author‚Äù published in the front pages of his later works. =Dowsing= In the 1940s, Roberts became acquainted with Henry Gross, a retired Maine game warden and amateur water dowser. He and Gross began a long association to use Gross's claimed dowsing abilities to find deposits of water, petroleum, uranium, and diamonds, through a corporation named Water Unlimited, Inc. Roberts documented his experiences in three nonfiction books that were popular successes but received much criticism from the scientific community. He joked that he should have given The Seventh Sense the subtitle Or How to Lose Friends and Alienate People. =Maine cooking= When Roberts was working on Trending Into Maine, he published a chapter in the Saturday Evening Post which was dedicated to dishes he remembered having as a boy growing up in Maine. Several months after the chapter was published he began to receive mail from residents and ex-residents who were troubled that he neglected to mention many of the dishes they knew and loved from the Pine Tree State. Roberts was distressed by the letters but decided to keep them, and they were eventually compiled by his secretary, Marjorie Mosser, and eventually included in the cookbook Good Maine Eats, which was first published in 1939. Roberts wrote the introduction to the book and a chapter on diet.Mosser, Marjorie (1939). Good Maine Food. Doubleday, Doran.

His career spanned the hot metal, phototypesetting and digital typesetting eras. Until his death, he lived in Bremgarten bei Bern. Frutiger's most famous designs, Univers, Frutiger and Avenir, are landmark sans-serif families spanning the three main genres of sans-serif typefaces: neogrotesque, humanist and geometric. Univers was notable for being one of the first sans-serif faces to form a consistent but wide-ranging family, across a range of widths and weights. Frutiger described creating sans-serif types as his \\"main life's work,\\" partially due to the difficulty in designing them compared to serif fonts. Early life Adrian Frutiger was born in Unterseen, Canton of Bern, the son of a weaver. As a boy, he experimented with invented scripts and stylized handwriting in a negative reaction to the formal, cursive penmanship then required by Swiss schools. His father and his secondary school teachers encouraged him to pursue an apprenticeship rather than pure art. After initially planning to train as a pastry chef, Frutiger secured an apprenticeship at the printing house in Interlaken. Formative years and personal life At the age of sixteen, he was apprenticed for four years, as a compositor, to the printer in Interlaken, also taking classes in woodcuts and drawing at the in Bern under , followed by employment as a compositor at Gebr. Fretz in Z√ºrich, Switzerland. In 1949 he transferred to the Kunstgewerbeschule Z√ºrich, where he studied under , and until 1951. Students there studied monumental inscriptions from Roman forum rubbings. At the Kunstgewerbeschule Z√ºrich, Frutiger concentrated on calligraphy ‚Äî a craft favouring the nib and the brush, instead of drafting tools, but also began sketches for what would become Univers, influenced by the sans-serif types popular in contemporary graphic design. Frutiger married in 1952, who died in 1954 after the birth of their son . He married the theologian Simone Bickel in 1955. They had two daughters, who both experienced mental health problems and committed suicide as adolescents. Disappointed by the standard of mental health care at the time, Frutiger and his wife founded the ' to fund psychology and neuroscience research and developments in mental health support. In an interview, Frutiger described himself as a Calvinist. Frutiger spent most of his professional career working in Paris and living in France, returning to Switzerland later in life. Career Specimens of typefaces by Adrian Frutiger , of the Paris foundry , recruited Frutiger based upon the quality of the illustrated essay / / Lettering: the development of European letter types carved in wood, Frutiger's final project at the Kunstgewerbeschule Z√ºrich. Frutiger's wood-engraved illustrations of the essay demonstrated his skill, meticulousness, and knowledge of letter forms. At Deberny & Peignot foundry, Frutiger designed the typefaces , M√©ridien, and . In addition, set Frutiger to work upon converting extant typefaces for the new phototypesetting Linotype equipment. Adrian Frutiger's first commercial typeface was ‚Äî a set of titling capital letters with small, bracketed serifs, released in 1954. A calligraphic, informal, script face, (\\"wave\\" in French), also was released in 1954. In 1955, , a glyphic, old-style, serif text face was released. The typeface shows inspiration by Nicolas Jenson, and, in the type, Frutiger's ideas of letter construction, unity, and organic form, are first expressed together. Raph Levien described as a \\"Frutiger trademark\\" his common use of an \\"a\\" where the loop makes a horizontal line at the top on meeting the vertical. It makes use of narrow wedge serifs, a style sometimes known as Latin which Frutiger would often use in his future serif designs. In 1956, he designed his first-of-three, slab-serif typefaces ‚Äî Egyptienne, on the Clarendon model; after Univers, it was the second, new text face to be commissioned for photo-composition. =Univers= Univers Bold Condensed on a London street sign envisioned a large, unified font family, that might be set in both the metal and the photo-composition systems. Impressed by the success of the Bauer foundry's Futura typeface, encouraged a new, geometric sans-serif type in competition. Frutiger disliked the regimentation of Futura, and persuaded that the new sans-serif should be based on the realist (neo- grotesque) model. The 1898 face, Akzidenz-Grotesk, is cited as the primary model. To maintain unity across the 21 variants, each weight and width, in roman (upright) and oblique (slanted), was drawn and approved before any matrices were cut. In the Univers font, Frutiger introduced his two-digit numeration; the first digit (3 though 8) indicates the weight, \\"3\\" the lightest, \\"8\\" the heaviest. The second digit indicates the face-width and either roman or oblique. It was marketed with a design inspired by the periodic table. The response to Univers was immediate and positive; he claimed it became the model for his future typefaces. His slab serif designs Serifa (1967) and Glypha (1977) are directly based upon it. Univers attracted attention to Frutiger's work outside continental Europe, and he was commissioned by Monotype to create Apollo, their first typeface specifically created for phototypesetting, which was released in 1964. =Frutiger= ASTRA-Frutiger, a condensed variant of Frutiger, on a road sign near Lugano in Switzerland in 2011 Frutiger in use by the Dutch rail system In 1961‚Äì64, Frutiger created with Andr√© G√ºrtler a sans-serif font named Concorde for news use in regular and bold styles for Parisian printing company Sofratype. Required to create a design clearly different to Univers, the design based on classical capitals with a greater classical influence than Univers, partially influenced by a serif design he had worked on in the interim. The design failed to attract attention and was withdrawn from sale after a few years. In 1970, Frutiger was asked to design signage at the new Charles de Gaulle Airport in the suburb of Paris. The \\"way-finding-signage\\" commission brief required a typeface both legible from afar and from an angle. Frutiger decided to adapt Concorde using legibility research as a guide, and titled the new design . In 1974, the Mergenthaler Linotype Company commissioned Frutiger to develop a print version of with improvements such as better spacing, which was released for public use under the name of Frutiger in 1976. Extremely legible at a distance or at small size, Frutiger became hugely influential on the development of future humanist sans-serif typefaces; font designer Erik Spiekermann described it as \\"the best general typeface ever\\" while Steve Matteson described it as \\"the best choice for legibility in pretty much any situation\\" at small text sizes. Frutiger is an amalgamation of Univers tempered with organic influences of the Gill Sans, a humanist sans-serif typeface by Eric Gill, Edward Johnston's type for the London Transport, and Roger Excoffon's Antique Olive: like Univers it uses a single-story 'g', unlike the double of Gill Sans, and has square dots on the letters, but has a generally humanist design with wide apertures to increase legibility, decided on after legibility research. In the 1970s, Frutiger designed , a wedge-serif design with mild stroke modulation, which has many similarities in basic letter structure to Frutiger, and in overall effect to Albertus. Frutiger's intention was more unusual: to create a design that could be modified by computer, through extreme slanting, morphing or changing stroke width, without seeming as if it had been distorted. Frutiger designed a number of other signage projects in the 1970s. These included an adaptation of Univers for the , after the RATP, the public transport authority of Paris, asked Frutiger to examine the signage. He created a Univers font variation ‚Äî a set of capitals and numbers specifically for white-on-dark-blue backgrounds in poor light. He also designed a slab serif font for the . Frutiger's 1984 typeface Versailles is an old-style serif text with capitals like those in the earlier . Versailles is a Latin design with sharp wedge serifs, based on a popular genre in 19th-century printing. =Avenir= election campaign of French president . In 1988, Frutiger completed the family . Frutiger intended the design to be a more human version of geometric sans-serif types popular in the 1930s such as Erbar and Futura, and it is named (\\"future\\" in French) as a reference to the latter. In a complete reverse, his next design Westside was a wild-west themed slab serif, inspired by reverse-contrast French Clarendons of the late 19th century. =Late designs= In 1991, Frutiger finished Vectora, a design influenced by Morris Fuller Benton's type faces Franklin Gothic and News Gothic. The resultant face has a tall x-height and is legible in small-point sizes. Frutiger's 1991 release Linotype was an elegant revival of the typeface adapted to display use, which remains popular; it is the version of Didot bundled with OS X, for example. While Frutiger continued to be involved in adaptations and expansions of pre-existing families and smaller projects, he described in 1998 as his \\"last typeface design\\". =The roots of letters= Sample of the font Frutiger Stones Linotype launched a font series named Type Before Gutenberg in 1989 and in the 1990s, Frutiger released as part of it a series of designs inspired by pre-printing alphabets, such as and Pompeijana, inspired by Roman brush lettering, Rusticana, inspired by ' Roman carving. He later also created Frutiger Stones (no connection to Frutiger), a playful design inspired by the shapes of pebbles. Parts of this design were finalised by Linotype's team; it was based on an alphabet drawn by Frutiger on a 1992 Christmas card. He also created Capitalis, inspired by brush lettering but without a specific historical source. Nami, an uncial design Frutiger had been considering since 1992, followed in 2007. =Remastered releases= Frutiger Next in use with Frutiger Serif, an adaptation of his earlier In the late 1990s, Frutiger began collaborating on refining and expanding his most famous Univers, Frutiger, and families. The new projects took advantage of improved digital production methods to create a wider range of styles and improved hinting for onscreen display. Univers was reissued as Linotype Univers with sixty-three variants; Frutiger was reissued as Frutiger Next with additional weights. Collaborating with Linotype designer Akira Kobayashi, Frutiger expanded the font family with light weights, heavy weights, and a condensed version that were released as the Next font. Frutiger described the process of restoring Univers as a \\"personal gift.\\" These modifications were not universally considered improvements: Frutiger regretted allowing Linotype to substitute a modish 1990s true italic (not drawn by Frutiger) onto Frutiger Next instead of the sharper oblique Frutiger preferred throughout his career. In his autobiography, Frutiger commented that in resigning himself to it \\"Maybe I was too soft to say what I really felt... I didn't have the strength and patience anymore.\\" From a different perspective, type designer Martin Majoor commented that he preferred the italic but described Linotype Univers as \\"staggering\\" and \\"not an improvement\\" for its return to the very aggressively slanted italic of Frutiger's original drawings: \\"Redesigning an old successful typeface is something a type designer should maybe never consider.\\" Frutiger commented on the italic that he felt Univers needed to be \\"snappy\\" and that it added character. In 2009, Frutiger collaborated with Akira Kobayashi on a second re-release of Frutiger, , which moved back towards the original 1970s release. Through his later years, Frutiger collaborated with co-authors Heidrun Osterer and Philipp Stamm on an extensive autobiography, Typefaces: the Complete Works (2008, republished 2014). In this book, Frutiger discussed his entire career and his completed and abandoned projects.

These organizations are recognized by the Israeli government. The full name is \\"ZAKA ‚Äì Identification, Extraction and Rescue ‚Äì True Kindness\\" (). Members of ZAKA, most of whom are Orthodox Jews, assist ambulance crews, aid in the identification of the victims of terrorism, road accidents and other disasters, and where necessary gather body parts and spilled blood for proper burial. They also provide first aid and rescue services, and help with the search for missing persons and participate in international rescue and recovery operations. The founders and members of ZAKA prefer to call the organization and their work Chesed shel Emet (◊ó◊°◊ì ◊©◊ú ◊ê◊û◊™ ‚Äì \\"Kindness of truth\\"), because they are dedicated to ensuring that the bodies of Jewish victims are buried according to Halakha, Jewish law. After acts of terrorism, ZAKA volunteers also collect the bodies and body parts of non-Jews, including suicide bombers, for return to their families. The phrase Chesed shel Emet refers to doing \\"kindness\\" for the benefit of the deceased, which is considered to be \\"true kindness\\", because the (deceased) beneficiaries of the kindness cannot return the kindness. History Zaka armoured ambulance for use in the West Bank The organization preceding ZAKA started when a group of volunteers under the leadership of Rabbi Elazar Gelbstein gathered to assist in the recovery of human remains from a terrorist attack on bus line 405 in Israel in 1989. The ZAKA network was set up in the early 1950s and was founded in the 1990s by Yehuda Meshi Zahav and Rabbi Moshe Aizenbach as a non-profit organization in addition to its police status. This arrangement succeeded the ZAKA organization founded by Rabbi Gelbstein in 1989. In 1995 the newly organized ZAKA were recognized by the Israeli government and now work closely with the Israel Police in the identification of disaster victims. ZAKA activities expanded rapidly during the al-Aqsa Intifada (from September 2000), when frequent terrorist suicide bombings created many scenes of disaster, with the remains and body parts of many victims strewn around bombing sites. In 2004, a group of ZAKA volunteers flew to The Hague, with the wreckage of the bus destroyed in the Jerusalem bus suicide bombing on 29 January 2004. The wreckage, along with pictures of 950 victims of terrorism, was taken to Washington, D.C. to urge the United States government to act against terrorism.Suicide bombing of Egged bus no. 19 in Jerusalem. Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. January 29, 2004. Retrieved April 6, 2008. The bus was later displayed at various US universities.Bombed Israeli Bus on Display at Duke Oct. 12-13, Duke University News and Communications, October 11, 2004 In January 2016, after two failed attempts, ZAKA was granted the status by the United Nations as a consultant non-governmental organization.UN gives ZAKA official consultant status Organization In 2010, ZAKA volunteers numbered 1,500. These volunteers work in coordination with Israeli government agencies on any unnatural death including vehicle accidents, terrorist bombing, murder or suicide. Trained as paramedics and in first aid, the volunteers, who are on call 24/7, attempt to revive the victims and, if unsuccessful, respectfully attend to the dead. ZAKA also has two units made up of Bedouin, Muslim, and Druze volunteers to serve Israel's non-Jewish communities, primarily Bedouin in the Negev and Druze in the Galilee. According to both Jewish and Muslim religious law, it is important to treat the dead respectfully, whether it be covering the bodies so that others cannot see them or collecting every last body part for burial, including blood. These units also function when religious Jews cannot, on the Jewish Sabbath and holidays. According to Jewish law, Jews may violate the Sabbath to save a life, but not to deal with the dead. International rescue and recovery operations In late 2004 and early 2005, members of ZAKA provided assistance in Thailand, Sri Lanka, India and Indonesia in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Forensic teams reportedly dubbed the group \\"the team that sleeps with the dead\\" because they toiled nearly 24 hours a day at Buddhist pagodas in Thailand that had been transformed into morgues to identify those who died in the tsunami. The experience of ZAKA members, who reportedly see 38 bodies a week on average in Israel, helped the Israeli forensic team to identify corpses faster than many of the other forensic teams that operated in Thailand in the aftermath of the disaster, which placed them in high demand with grieving families. In February 2007, ZAKA sent a 10-person search and rescue team, consisting primarily of rescue divers, to Paris to search for a missing Israeli Defense official. The mission was funded by the Defense Ministry at an expected cost of $80,000. In November 2008, ZAKA volunteers went to Mumbai, India following terrorist attacks that included a Jewish center among its targets. Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, a six-man ZAKA International Search and Rescue Unit delegation arrived in Haiti to assist with search and recovery efforts. Working with the Mexican military delegation and Jewish volunteers from Mexico, eight students trapped under the rubble of the collapsed eight-storey Port-au-Prince University building were rescued on the first day after their arrival.Levi Julian, Hana (14 January 2010) One Israeli Still Missing in Haiti Earthquake, Israel National News Retrieved 2010‚Äì01‚Äì188 saved during \\"Shabbat from hell\\" (January 17, 2010) in Israel 21c Innovation News Service Retrieved 2010‚Äì01‚Äì18ZAKA rescuemission to Haiti 'proudly desecrating Shabbat' Religious rescue team holds Shabbat prayer with members of international missions in Port au-Prince. Retrieved 2010‚Äì01‚Äì22 Teams of ZAKA volunteers were sent to Japan in March 2011 to assist in search-and-rescue after the devastating earthquake and subsequent tsunami. A ZAKA team went out with an Israeli mission to Nepal in late April 2015 to help search for casualties in the aftermath of the earthquake and subsequent avalanches. In January 2017, a team of ZAKA volunteers worked overtime searching for survivors subsequent to a 7.0-level earthquake in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. In January 2019, a ZAKA team deployed in Brazil to conduct search and rescue operations following a dam collapse in Brumadinho. Public recognition In Israel, the primary Chesed Shel Emes organization is known as ZAKA, though other organizations exist.◊©◊í◊ô◊ê◊î The devotion of the members of ZAKA and the professional manner in which they handled difficult and tragic scenes, such as the treatment of the bodies of victims killed in suicide bombings, led to strong public respect and admiration. The great contribution of ZAKA to Israeli society was soon widely recognized. This recognition enabled ZAKA to recruit more volunteers, and with growing monetary donations, purchase advanced equipment, such as first aid kits, ambulances, MIRS (communications) and motorcycles (for rapid response). The increase in reputation, donations and manpower enabled ZAKA to participate in additional voluntary activities beyond disaster victim identification and supplying first aid. Such other activities include helping senior citizens and education initiatives to prevent road accidents. One of the founders of ZAKA, Yehuda Meshi Zahav, was given the honor of lighting an honorary beacon on Israel's 55th Independence Day ceremonies on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem, the revered burial spot of modern Zionism's founder Theodor Herzl. Controversy In August 2007, ZAKA members were accused of burning down a secret crematorium in Israel. Most Jews believe Jews should be buried according to religious tradition, not cremated. Zaka's founder Yehuda Meshi Zahav was reported to have called the existence of the crematorium a \\"desecration of the dead\\" and that the crematorium was \\"destined to disappear in flames\\". ZAKA strongly denied any involvement in the arson.

Cultural tourism is the subset of tourism concerned with a traveler's engagement with a country or region's culture, specifically the lifestyle of the people in those geographical areas, the history of those people, their art, architecture, religion(s), and other elements that helped shape their way of life. Overview Cultural tourism includes tourism in urban areas, particularly historic or large cities and their cultural facilities such as museums and theatres. It is generally agreed that cultural tourists spend substantially more than standard tourists do. This form of tourism is also becoming generally more popular throughout the world, and a recent OECD report has highlighted the role that cultural tourism can play in regional development in different world regions.OECD (2009) The Impact of Culture on Tourism. OECD, Paris Cultural tourism has been defined as 'the movement of persons to cultural attractions away from their normal place of residence, with the intention to gather new information and experiences to satisfy their cultural needs'.Richards, G. (1996) Cultural Tourism in Europe. CABI, Wallingford. Available to download from www.tram-research.com/atlas These cultural needs can include the solidification of one's own cultural identity, by observing the exotic \\"others\\". Destinations One type of cultural tourism destination is living cultural areas. Visiting any culture other than one's own such as traveling to a foreign country. Other destinations include historical sites, modern urban districts, \\"ethnic pockets\\" of town, fairs/festivals, theme parks, and natural ecosystems. It has been shown that cultural attractions and events are particularly strong magnets for tourism.Borowiecki, K.J. and C. Castiglione (2014). Cultural participation and tourism flows: An empirical investigation of Italian provinces. Tourism Economics, 20(2): 241-62. The term cultural tourism is used for journeys that include visits to cultural resources, regardless of whether it is tangible or intangible cultural resources, and regardless of the primary motivation. In order to understand properly the concept of cultural tourism, it is necessary to know the definitions of a number terms such as, for example, culture, tourism, cultural economy, cultural and tourism potentials, cultural and tourist offer, and others. Key principles =Destination planning= As the issue of globalization takes place in this modern time, the challenge of preserving the few remaining cultural communities around the world is becoming hard. In a tribal-based community, reaching economic advancement with minimal negative impacts is an essential objective to any destination planner. Since they are using the culture of the region as the main attraction, sustainable destination development of the area is vital for them to prevent the negative impacts (i.e., destroying the authentic identity of the tribal community) due to tourism. Management issues Certainly, the principle of \\"one size fits all‚Äù doesn't apply to destination planning. The needs, expectations, and anticipated benefits from tourism vary the money is good there. This is clearly exemplified as local communities living in regions with tourism potential (destinations) develop a vision for what kind of tourism they want to facilitate, depending on issues and concerns they want to be settled or satisfied. =Destination planning resources= Planning guides ;Culture ‚Äì the heart of development policy It is important that the destination planner take into account the diverse definition of culture as the term is subjective. Satisfying tourists' interests such as landscapes, seascapes, art, nature, traditions, ways of life and other products associated to them -which may be categorized cultural in the broadest sense of the word, is a prime consideration as it marks the initial phase of the development of a cultural destination. The quality of service and destination, which does not solely depend on the cultural heritage but more importantly to the cultural environment, can further be developed by setting controls and policies which shall govern the community and its stakeholders. It is therefore safe to say that the planner should be on the ball with the varying meaning of culture itself as this fuels the formulation of development policies that shall entail efficient planning and monitored growth (e.g. strict policy on the protection and preservation of the community). ;Local community, tourists, the destination and sustainable tourism While satisfying tourists' interests and demands may be a top priority, it is also imperative to ruminate the subsystems of the destination's (residents). Development pressures should be anticipated and set to their minimum level so as to conserve the area's resources and prevent a saturation of the destination as to not abuse the product and the residents correspondingly. The plan should incorporate the locals to its gain by training and employing them and in the process encourage them to participate to the travel business. Travellers should be not only aware about the destination but also concern on how to help it sustain its character while broadening their travelling experience. Research on tourism International tourism changes the world. The Centre for Tourism and Cultural Change (CTCC) is leading internationally in approaching Tourism for critical research relating to the relationships between tourism, tourists and culture. Sources of data The core of a planner‚Äôs job is to design an appropriate planning process and facilitate community decision. Ample information which is a crucial requirement is contributed through various technical researches and analyzes. Here are some of the helpful tools commonly used by planners to aid them: #Key Informant Interviews #Libraries, Internet, and Survey Research #Census and Statistical Analysis #Spatial Analysis with Geographical Information System (GIS) and Global Positioning System (GPS) technologies Key institutions Participating structures are primarily led by the government‚Äôs local authorities and the official tourism board or council, with the involvement of various NGOs, community and indigenous representatives, development organizations, and the academe of other countries. asd See also * Indigenous peoples * Archaeological tourism * Travel agency * Cultural tourism in Egypt References Further reading * Bob McKercher and Hilary du Cros, Cultural Tourism: The partnership between tourism and cultural heritage management, Routledge, 2002. * Greg Richards, Cultural Tourism: Global and local perspectives, Routledge, 2007. * Priscilla Boniface, Managing Quality Cultural Tourism, Routledge, 1995. * Milena Ivanovic, Cultural Tourism, Juta and Company Ltd, 2009.

Izumo is known for Izumo soba noodles and the Izumo Taisha Shinto shrine. History Izumo Taisha is the oldest Shinto shrine in Japan. In 2008, the holy area was open to the public from 1 August until August 17, after which extensive renovation work began. The nearby Shimane Museum of Ancient Izumo,Shimane Museum of Ancient Izumo also located in Taisha Machi, has artifacts from the site. In 2009, a team of archaeologists announced that they likely discovered‚Äîat the Sunabara Remains in Taki-ch≈ç, Izumo City‚Äîthe oldest stone tools ever found in Japan. The find totaled about 20 tools dating back an estimated 120,000 years: about 80,000 years earlier than previous estimates of when the first humans arrived in the Japanese archipelago. The stones were found directly across Route 9 from Kirara Taki beach on the Sea of Japan. The excavation team was led by Doshisha University professor Kazuto Matsufuji, and the first of the tools were unearthed by Toshiro Naruse, a professor emeritus at Hyogo University of Teacher Education.The Japan Times, (October 1, 2009), \\"Tools may rewrite Paleolithic Japan\\", accessed 11-25-2009 In Izumo, there are various tombs and temples, including an ancient cluster of tombs to the south of the station. Within this tomb cluster is located the largest Tumulus style tomb within the Izumo region. With an overall length of 100 metres and mound 6 metres in height, the tomb located behind the Dainenji Temple is believed to have been constructed in the 6th century with highly sophisticated construction methods for the time. The Takase River is a canal that runs through the center of Izumo. Beginning at the Hiikawa River, the canal runs directly across the town. Constructed by developer Okaji Shichibei in 1670, the Takase was the first canal ever constructed in the then-Matsue domain. Before Okaji began his agricultural developments, the Izumo area was infertile and unable to support crops. Thanks to Okaji's developments, the area became an important region for the growing of rice and grain in the Matsue area. Izumo Dome is a venue located just north of the city proper. It has the distinction of being Japan's largest wooden building, at 49 metres high and 143 metres in diameter. It is used for sports and events such as baseball games and soccer matches, as well as for other events including sumo. It is a prominent symbol of Izumo, and can be seen from a distance from the train passing towards Hamada. is a modern stone lighthouse with a powerful lamp. From the tower, one can see the Oki Islands, from where the story of the \\"white rabbit\\" comes. Shimane Winery is known for its super-sweet wines. \\"Kirara Taki\\" Beach is located in , one of the towns merged into Izumo in 2005. The beach has clean water and off-shore stacks of concrete tetrapods to break the waves. Nearby is an onsen called Marine Thalasso Izumo. The Okuizumo Museum of Tatara and Sword-making features demonstrations twice a month, switching off every two weeks: one demonstration shows smithing techniques, while the other is a usage demonstration. The Izumo Handicraft Museum is set in a traditional Japanese workshop complex. Demographics The modern city was founded on November 3, 1941. As of 2017, the total population is 172,039 and the area of the new city of Izumo is 624.36 km¬≤. On March 22, 2005, Izumo absorbed the city of Hirata, and the towns of Kory≈ç, Sada, Taisha and Taki (all from Hikawa District) to create the new and expanded city of Izumo. On October 1, 2011, the town of Hikawa (also from Hikawa District) was also merged into the new Izumo. Hikawa District was dissolved as a result of this merger. Transportation Izumo-shi Station Izumo is serviced by two rail networks. The first is the JR West Sanin Main Line, connecting Izumo-shi Station to Tottori through Yonago and Matsue to the east, and connecting along the coast to ≈åda, Hamada and Masuda to the west. The secondary rail network is the private Ichibata Electric Railway. Dentetsu Izumo-shi Station is the terminal, and the line runs from Izumo to Matsue, passing through and connecting Hirata. The Dentetsu line also branches out and runs to Izumo Taisha from Kawato Station. A JR West service to Taisha ran until 1990 when the line was closed and Izumo-Takamatsu and Arakaya stations removed. Taisha JR railway station still exists as a historic building. There is one airport inside the city of Izumo, Izumo Airport, located in the former town of Hikawa.

A powerful clan of Izumo (Idumo in Old Japanese) constituted an independent polity, but during the 4th century it was absorbed due to the expansion of the state of Yamato, within which it assumed the role of a sacerdotal domain. Even today, the Izumo Shrine constitutes (as does the Grand Shrine of Ise) one of the most important sacred places of Shinto: it is dedicated to kami, especially to ≈åkuninushi (≈å-kuni-nushi-no-mikoto), mythical progeny of Susanoo and all the clans of Izumo. The mythological mother of Japan, the goddess Izanami, is said to be buried on Mt. Hiba, at the border of the old provinces of Izumo and H≈çki, near modern-day Yasugi of Shimane Prefecture. By the Sengoku period, Izumo had lost much of its importance. It was dominated before the Battle of Sekigahara by the M≈çri clan, and after Sekigahara, it was an independent fief with a castle town at modern Matsue. In Japanese mythology, the entrance to Yomi (Hell, land of the dead) was located within the province, and was sealed by the god Izanagi by placing a large boulder over the entrance.

Watkins, the first president of the state's medical association and a member of the board of regents of the new University of Idaho. After Alex Ryrie died in 1900, Henrietta remarried, but after her father was murdered in 1901, her second marriage (to Elisha Nathaniel Brown) failed and she committed suicide in 1904 at age 29. Carol was then raised in Moscow by her widowed maternal grandmother, Caroline Woodhouse Watkins, the model for Caddie Woodlawn. They moved to Idaho in 1907, three years before statehood, when Carol was twelve, and her grandmother's life and storytelling abilities inspired Carol's writing from an early age. Brink started writing for her school newspapers and continued that in college; she graduated from the Portland Academy in Oregon and attended the University of Idaho in Moscow for three years (1914-17). She wrote for The Argonaut student newspaper and Gem of the Mountains yearbook and was a member of Gamma Phi Beta sorority. She transferred to the University of California in Berkeley for her senior year in 1917 and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1918, then on June 12 married Raymond W. Brink, a young mathematics professor she had met in Moscow nine years earlier. He had joined the faculty at the University of Minnesota a year prior and the couple made their home in St. Paul for 42 years. The Brinks raised a son (David) and a daughter (Nora), spent summers in the Wisconsin backwoods, and traveled for several years in Scotland and France. Brink‚Äôs first novel, Anything Can Happen on the River, was published in 1934. Brink wrote fiction throughout her life, and added poetry and painting to her later accomplishments. After 55 years of marriage, her husband died in 1973, and she died eight years later of heart failure at age 85 in La Jolla, California. In her family, the name Caroline or Carol has been given as either a first or middle name to the oldest female child without interruption for at least seven generations, continuing to the present day. =Hometown honors= Brink was awarded an honorary doctorate of letters from the University of Idaho in 1965.Ericka Streeby biography At the university is Brink Hall, a faculty office building which includes the English department. A classic ivy- covered brick structure, built in the 1930s to appear much older, it was originally the Willis Sweet dormitory and later the Faculty Office Complex East. Named for her shortly after her death, its companion west building was named for Archie Phinney. Across town in east Moscow is \\"Carol Ryrie Brink Nature Park,\\" a stream restoration area alongside Paradise Creek on land owned by the school district. Dedicated during the centennial celebration of Brink's birth in 1995, its west entrance is at Mountain View Road and 7th Street. At the city's north end, the children's section at the refurbished Carnegie building of the Moscow Public Library contains the \\"Carol Ryrie Brink Reading Room.\\" Opened in 1906, Brink had frequented that library as a youth.

Reason emulates a rack of hardware synthesizers, samplers, signal processors, sequencers, and mixers, all of which can be freely interconnected in an arbitrary manner. Reason can be used either as a complete virtual music studio or as a set of virtual instruments to be used with other sequencing software in a fashion that mimics live performance. Overview Reason 1.0 was released on November 22, 2000. The program's design mimics a studio rack into which users can insert virtual devices such as instruments, effects processors, and mixers. These modules can be controlled from Reason's built-in MIDI sequencer or from other sequencing applications such as Pro Tools, Logic, FL Studio, REAPER, Digital Performer, Cubase, Sonar, and GarageBand via Propellerhead's ReWire protocol in the 32-bit versions of these programs. Since the release of version 6 Reason supports ReWire with 64-bit hosts. As of version 7.0.1, devices available include: *Subtractor: a subtractive synthesizer *Malstr√∂m: a graintable synthesizer (granular synthesis + wavetable synthesis) *NN-19: a simple sampler, which loads pre-recorded instrumental and vocal sounds *NN-XT: an advanced sampler, which features the option of tweaking the various modulation, oscillation, and filter parameters of a preloaded sample or patch *Dr Octo Rex: a loop playback device, which slices prerecorded samples *Redrum: a sample based drum machine with a step sequencer *Thor: a semi- modular synthesizer which features, among others, wavetable synthesis, frequency modulation synthesis (FM), and phase distortion synthesis *Kong Drum Designer: a 16-pad drum synthesizer with analog synthesizers emulating the classic generators of drums like the Roland TR series, physical modelling drum synthesizers and sampler akin to the Akai MPC series. *Neptune: A voice synthesizer and pitch correction tool, capable of Vocoder-like polyphonic voice synthesis as well as robotic, AutoTune-like pitch adjustment and more subtle pitch corrections.Reason 6 - Neptune *Alligator: A triple filtered gate, sometimes known as a \\"trance gate\\". Alligator splits an incoming signal into three signals, which are then gated and filtered using lowpass, bandpass and highpass filters on each respective channel. Alligator also is capable of adding delay, distortion, phasing and stereo panning effects to each channel, and each of the filters can be modulated with a filter envelope embedded in the unit.Reason 6 - Alligator *Pulveriser: A multi-purpose piece of virtual hardware that combines compression, distortion, filters, tremolo, parallel signal processing and an envelope follower.Reason 6 - Pulveriser *The Echo: An echo unit based on tape echo and delay.Reason 6 - The Echo * External MIDI Instrument: A device which allows for MIDI output from Reason to an external MIDI instrument Sounds from these devices can be routed via either of two mixing devices or simple merging and splitting utilities. Effects include distortion, reverb, chorus, a vocoder, and mastering effects. The Combinator device, introduced in Reason 3.0, allows users to combine multiple modules into one. Another device connects Reason to Propellerhead's (now discontinued) ReBirth RB-338. Reason's interface includes a Toggle Rack command, which turns the \\"rack\\" around to display the devices from the rear. Here the user can route virtual audio and CV cables from one piece of equipment to another. This cable layout enables the creation of complex effects chains and allows devices to modulate one another. This offers flexibility in the way that is familiar to users of physical electronic music hardware. For example, Redrum's main outputs could be connected to a single channel of the mixing desk, or instead each of its drum sounds could be routed to a separate EQ before sending them to separate channels in the mixer, or rather than audio output the channels of the ReDrum could be used to trigger the gates of an Alligator via CV. The user can always choose where to draw the line between simplicity and precision, allowing the software to remain useful at various levels of knowledge on the user's part. Reason 6 introduced audio recording (by incorporating Record), turning it into a digital audio workstation. However, it did not support third-party plug-ins, being one of the few software sequencers to lack VST support. Reason 6.5 introduced rack extensions, which are rack instruments and signal processors that may be developed by third parties. In Reason version 9.5, Propellerheads added the long-desired VST support. A stripped-down version of Reason known as Reason Adapted, which restricts the user to a limited number of devices, is packaged as bonus software with other audio software such as Pro Tools LE and ReCycle. =Reason 2.0= Released in 2002, version 2.0 added MIDI capability to control the software with external MIDI devices. It added two new sound devices, the Malstr√∂m Graintable Synthesizer and NN-XT Advanced Sampler. Also included was the 540MB Orkester Sound Library which added Orchestral-based sounds primarily designed for use with the NN-XT. =Reason 2.5= Released in 2003, Version 2.5 added new effects devices such as the RV7000 Advanced Reverb, BV512 Digital Vocoder, and Scream 4 Sound Destruction Unit. Three smaller devices, the UN16 Unison, and Spider Audio router and Spider CV router added to the 1/2 rack-sized units. =Reason 3.0= Reason 3 was released on March 10, 2005. It added the MClass Mastering Suite which included a four-band parametric & shelving EQ, stereo processor, compressor and maximizer modules. It also added the Combinator, a special device that allowed users to build chains of other Reason devices inside of it to create a more complex instrument that was easier to control and manage. =Reason 4.0= Released in 2007, version 4 introduced the Thor polysonic modular synth; a device that had discreet sound generating and processing modules that can be swapped out with various types of oscillators and filter combinations. It also released the RPG8 Monophonic Arpeggiator that breaks up chords into various note-triggering patterns. Finally the ReGroove mixer was introduced, a device that added shuffle controls and more human-qualities to sequenced patterns. Also Reason's linear sequencer was improved. =Reason 5= Reason 5 was released on 25 August 2010. For the first time, Reason could directly sample audioReason 5 Live Sampling preview with any of its sample- playing instruments such as the Redrum, the NN-19, the NN-XT, and the Kong Drum Designer. * Dr. Octo Rex - The Dr. Rex loop player was given an overhaul and is now called \\"Dr. Octo Rex\\"Reason 5 Dr. Octo Rex preview and can play up to eight sample loops (one at a time), and includes many new features for editing the loops and individual clips. * Kong Drum Designer - This is new to the programReason 5 Kong Drum Synthesizer preview a 16-pad device that can create drum and percussion sounds using various sound production techniques, including physical modeling, sample playback (the \\"NN-Nano\\" module), and virtual analog synthesis. Signature Patches created by well known Reason users have been added, including patches made by Two Lone Swordsmen, Vengeance, and Richard Barbieri. Finally, a new pattern editing tool called \\"Blocks\\"Reason 5 Blocks preview has been created for easier song arrangement and mixing. =Reason 6= Reason 6 was released on September 30, 2011. It integrates all of the features found in Record 1.5 ‚Äì such as the ability to record live sound, the mixing desk modeled on the SSL 9000k, and the Neptune pitch corrector ‚Äì into its setup. The Record name has been phased out altogether. As well as bringing all of Record's features into the Reason rack, Reason 6 is 64-bit and features three new effects units, as also audio transposing direct on the sequencer, and improved tuning and stretching algorithms: * Pulveriser - a combined compression, distortion, and filtering unit. * The Echo - an advanced stereo echo unit modeled on analog tape echo machines like the Roland RE-201. * Alligator - a pattern-based gate effect which splits sound signals into three channels, allowing for differing multiple effects on each separate channel. * ID-8 Instrument Device - a sound module with a built-in palette of 36 preset sound banks, such as a piano, organ, guitar and drum kits. The ID-8 also functions as a default MIDI device that will play sounds when a MIDI file is loaded into Reason 6. Reason 6 also required a USB software protection dongle called the \\"Ignition Key\\" to prevent unauthorized use of the software. Without the dongle, Reason 6 will not open saved files, nor will it dump audio to a sound file, but is otherwise fully functional. If the key is lost, or chosen not to be used, a user must log onto Propellerhead's server for internet verification, requiring the host computer to have an internet connection. =Reason 6.5= On March 20, 2012, Propellerhead announced the planned release for Reason 6.5 in 2012 Q2 to coincide with the release of Rack Extensions (which allow the use of 3rd party designed instruments and effect modules inside of Reason). Along with Rack Extensions developed by various third parties, Propellerhead offered three optional devices at launch: * Polar \\\\- a harmonizing and pitch-shifter effect unit. * Pulsar \\\\- a dual-channel low frequency oscillator unit. * Radical Piano \\\\- a piano synthesizer based on sampling technology and physical modeling algorithms that is capable of creating new and unique piano sounds based on audio samples from two types of grand pianos and an upright piano. Reason 6 and 6.5 include the features of Record and are now able to record external audio. Reason project file sizes that include audio record takes tend to be larger than for previous versions since there is currently no way to save Reason projects with the record takes as external (non-embedded) audio. =Reason 7= Reason 7 was released on April 30, 2013. New features include a MIDI Output Rack Device, audio quantize, loop slicing with export to Dr. Octo REX, native mix bus routing, and a spectrum EQ. Propellerhead-developed rack extensions that were released during version 7 include: * Audiomatic - This is a sound effects unit that adds vintage audio quirks to music, making it sound as if it were being played back from past devices such as analog tape, a vinyl record, a crackling radio, an old television set, etc. * Parsec \\\\- This is described as a spectral synthesizer using additive synthesis to sculpt various sounds. * PX7 - This rack device emulates the 80's sounds of the classic Yamaha DX series of synthesizers that used frequency modulation synthesis. The PX7 can even use patches converted from DX synths. * Radical Keys \\\\- Similar to Radical Piano, this emulates various electric pianos and organs such as the Rhodes Mk1, the Wurlitzer and the Hohner Pianet-T. * Rotor - This is a rotating speaker emulator modeled after the Leslie 122 rotary speaker of the 1940s to add realistic vintage flavors to music, especially organ and guitar tracks. * Synchronous - Described as a timed effect modulator, this adds various effects to a music device it is linked to such as distortion, filtering and delay which can be controlled by drawing various waveforms in the device's main display. For example, it can be used to add characteristic synthesizer wobbles and beat glitches that are popular in dubstep and drum and bass. Reason 7 no longer requires the use of the Ignition Key USB dongle to fully function, instead, one computer can be licensed to use the software on installation. If a license holder wishes to use the software on other computers, they can purchase an Ignition Key separately for that purpose, or verify their license over the internet. =Reason 8= Reason 8 was released September 30, 2014. This version's newest feature is the improved file browser that accompanies, or optionally fully replaces the rack window. Users can easily audition sound files, loops and instruments patches in the browser then drag the files from the browser right to the rack window or the sequencer allowing improved and faster workflow. This version also comes with two free rack extensions; the Softube Amp, a guitar amplifier emulator and Softube Bass Amp, a bass guitar amplifier emulator designed by the veteran Rack Extension developer Softube. Both rack extensions are also available separately for Reason 6.5 and 7 and do not require the version 8 upgrade. In 2016, the Softube amps are set to fully replace the depreciated Line 6 amplifier rack units that were originally introduced in Propellerhead's Record software and later versions of Reason. Propellerhead-developed rack extensions that were released during version 8 include: * A-List Acoustic Guitarist - A sample-based acoustic classical guitar emulator that produces realistic strumming guitar sounds which can be modified by selecting various playing styles and chord characteristics. * A-List Classic Drummer - A variant of the Studio Drummer rack device (see below) focusing on dryer and tighter percussion sounds reminiscent of early pop audio recordings. * A-List Power Drummer - A variant of the Studio Drummer rack device (see below) focusing on hard driving percussion sounds for harder- edged music compositions. * A-List Studio Drummer - A sample-based automated drum machine that emulates various acoustic drum kits as if played by a live- performing drummer and uses keyboard triggers to alter the playing styles and rhythmic patterns, as well as trigger various intros, change-ups, fills and stops. * Pop Chords A-List Electric Guitarist - Similar to the A-List Acoustic Guitarist, this emulates realistic sounding electric guitar rhythm chords in a wide variety of strum methods commonly performed in pop rock, alternative and funk styles of music. * Power Chords A-List Electric Guitarist - Similar to the A-List Acoustic Guitarist, this emulates realistic sounding electric guitar with more powerful rhythm chords in various strumming styles popular in rock and metal styles of music. A later update for Reason 8 also included an improved version of the RV7000 reverb unit. The renamed RV7000 Mk. II was designated an \\"Advanced Convolution Reverb\\" and features a convolution reverb effect section that uses audio sample-based impulse-responses to emulate the reverberation of a physical or virtual space. =Reason 9= Reason 9 was released on June 21, 2016. The main feature of this version is the addition of a new class of rack devices called \\"Players\\" that are listed in the device browser along with the existing instruments, effects and utility devices. Players added to the rack can only be attached to instrument devices and \\"sit\\" between the instrument and the MIDI input whether it be from a keyboard, Reason's sequencer or other rack device. Players can also be combined together. Reason 9 ships with three player devices: *Dual Arpeggio - As its name suggests, this player is a polyphonic, parallel arpeggiator that generates two rhythmic note patterns, (or arpeggios), from notes and chords played via MIDI input and can play them simultaneously. The patterns can be edited via a graphic display to play up to 4 separate notes per step, up to 16 steps. Additional controls include setting keyboard velocity and gate length information for each note, setting keyboard splits and more. *Note Echo - This player is similar to a delay effect, but instead of repeating an instrument's audio output the player repeats the MIDI notes that are being input to the instrument. The device can further edit each note it repeats allowing adjustment of such things as the amount of repeat steps, key velocity and the pitch of each step, and allows for creative experiment with chiptune and glissando effects. *Scales and Chords - This device has two functions. When using Scales, the performer sets the key of the song they are playing and during the performance, the device keeps the input MIDI notes from straying out of the set key; thus it helps avoid playing a wrong note. With Chords activated, the performer can play complex chord progressions with the press of a single key, again staying in key to the selected musical scale and chord characteristic. The device includes a comprehensive list of classic music theory scales and chord progressions and allows users to create their own custom chords. Reason 9 adds also an improved monophonic Pitch Editor, designed for vocal and other melodic sources, with similar functionalities to other Pitch editor Software. Reason 9 also has improved workflow and sequencer features such as bounce Audio-to-MIDI, (which creates a MIDI pattern based on detecting the notes played in a prerecorded piece of music), MIDI-to-Audio, (which allows a quick rendering of an instrument's selected MIDI pattern directly to an audio track), the capability to reverse MIDI patterns, and for the first time the ability to set window themes. It also ships with a new library of over 1000 sound patches. Propellerhead's Audiomatic and Pulsar rack extensions that were once available separately are included as native effects units in Reason 9. Rack Extensions developed during Reason 9 include: * Fingerpicking Nylon - A-List Acoustic Guitarist - Similar to the A-List Acoustic Guitarist, but emulates the expressiveness of a classical guitar strung with nylon strings. * Layers - Described as a \\"quadrasonic sample player,\\" Layers is a sample-based synthesizer that was developed in cooperation with Pink Noise Studios, a producer of numerous audio libraries and refills for Reason. Layers emulates the sounds of many classic synthesizers such as the Roland Jupiter-4, Korg MS-20, Yamaha CS-80 and Oberheim Matrix among others, and can combine up to four separate sounds at one time to create layered audio textures. The sounds can be further manipulated by a suite of built-in effects, modulation controls and sequencers for each layer. Propellerhead released Reason 9.1 with Ableton Link support. Propellerhead released Reason 9.2 which added new SDK tools for rack extensions developers to improve the functionality of their rack extensions and add new features that were unavailable in previous versions of Reason. A new feature in particular allows rack extensions to load audio samples in a variety of formats. Various developers have released entirely new and/or updated versions of their previous devices to take advantage of these new features such as allowing users of their sample-based synths to create and modify their own custom audio wavetables. Unfortunately, version 9.2 updated extensions will not work in older versions of Reason. On April 28, 2017 Propellerhead announced plans to support VST plugins in Reason 9.5. It was released May 29, 2017 with VST support. =Reason 10= The release of Reason 10 was announced on September 22, 2017 and was released on October 25, 2017. It was advertised as Reason's \\"biggest upgrade\\" ever and features five new devices as well as a new multi-gigabyte library of sounds and device patches. New devices in Reason 10 include: * Europa - Europa is an advanced wavetable synthesizer, inspired by the Thor synth that came a decade prior. It has many functions for morphing and manipulating sounds from buzzing basses to glitch effects. * Grain - Grain is an advanced graintable synthesizer, capable of playing imported audio samples in a wide variety of ways and includes features to manipulate the sampled audio into completely new sounds. Reason 10 also includes a collection of three new sample-based \\"organic instrument\\" devices. Each device has a filter and tone controls along with built-in reverb and delay effects. * Klang - Klang is a tuned percussion player based on samples of instruments like the glockenspiel, wine bottles, a music box and more. * Pangea - Pangea is a world instruments player based on samples of various plucked, strummed, pumped and blown instruments from around the world. * Humana - Humana is a choir and vocal player based on samples of the human voice. The Radical Piano and Synchronous rack extensions, once sold separately, are included as standard devices. Rack Extensions developed by Propellerhead during Reason 10 include: * Layers Wave Edition - A sample-based synthesizer based around the audio of the Waldorf Wave, a digital wavetable synthesizer of the 1990s. =Reason 10.1= The Reason 10.1 update was released May 8, 2018 and included new features to the SDK (System Development Kit) that allow Rack Extension developers to create new Player devices introduced in Reason version 9. Prior to this, the only Player devices available were those developed by Propellerhead themselves. The update also included a new Player device by Propellerhead as well as an update to the Europa synth that allows audio samples to be used as wavetables. Rack Extensions developed by Propellerhead during Reason 10.1 include: * Drum Sequencer - A pattern-based player, primarily focused on percussion programming, that includes features such as per-channel time resolution, probability control and note repeating that are unavailable in Reason's main sequencer. For a limited time it was offered to Reason 10.1 owners for free. * Umpf Club Drums - A sample-based drum and percussion module that features effects and sounds particularly useful for dance and techno music, although users have the option to load in their own audio samples. The device can be sequenced by the Drum Sequencer player as well as Reason's main sequencer and other sequencing rack devices. * Umpf Retro Beats - Similar to the Umpf Club Drums rack extension but with an audio library and built in effects that are geared toward recreating classic drum machine and percussion sounds that were popular in 80's electronic music. * Reason Electric Bass - A sample-based electric bass guitar emulator that uses recordings bass instruments including Fender Jazz and Precision, Rickenbacker and Les Paul. Users can also modify the sounds through a selection of microphones, cabinets and a signal chain of built-in effects pedals as well as adjusting the dynamics of the playing style to create a more realistic sounding performance. =Reason 10.2= Reason 10.2, released on September 26, 2018 includes mainly work flow improvements like Multi Lane Editing for MIDI, adaptive snap to grid, improved navigation. Rack Extensions developed by Propellerhead during Reason 10.2 include: * Complex-1 Modular Synthesizer - This synthesizer emulates modular synthesis programming, with front panel signal and modulation patch cables that the user can route manually between the device's various modules, such as the oscillators, filters, effects and more. * Quad Note Generator - A player module and creativity tool that acts as a melody generator using up to four lanes of note patterns based on the user's selected scale, MIDI input and rhythm settings. * Reason Drum Kit - A new multi sampled instrument focused on drums. It is essentially an older refill from propeller now packaged as an instrument with a user friendly interface. =Reason 10.3= The Reason 10.3 update was released April 15, 2019. It included an overhaul to the code that handles VST plugins, with big performance improvements as a result. As an additional effect rack extensions and internal devices perform better as well. Rack extensions developed by Propellerhead during Reason 10.3: * Reason Drum Kits - A sample-based drum machine that utilizes acoustic drum and percussion sounds taken from the former Reason Drum Kits Sample library now self- contained inside a rack device. It also features effects to emulate various studio arrangements and microphone set ups. =Reason 10.4= The Reason 10.4 update was released May 23, 2019. It included a few stability improvements but also two new devices to be compatible with the newly released Reason Compact 2.0, namely Monotone, a bass line synthesizer, and Rytmik, a sample player optimized for drum samples that comes with a few presets for different styles. Rack Extensions developed by Propellerhead during Reason 10.4 include: * PolyStep Sequencer - A new player device aimed at easily generating complex chord progressions and melodies * Processed Pianos - A sample-based piano emulator with that utilizes samples from the former Reason Pianos sound library. It also features and effects to emulate various studio arrangement and microphone set ups. =Reason 11= Reason 11 was announced on August 26, 2019, and was released on September 25, 2019. It adds workflow improvements to the sequencer and a few new devices. It also introduces the new Reason Rack Plugin, a VST3 plugin which allows for Reason's rack to be used as a plugin in other DAWs.https://www.propellerheads.com/blog/announcing-reason-11-a-word- from-the-product-manager An AU plugin version was also released before the end of 2019. Reason 11 will now be offered in three tiers: Reason Intro, Reason and Reason Suite. The new upper tier includes Reason and adds most rack extensions made by Reason Studios, including the new Scenic Hybrid Instrument. New devices will include: * Quartet Chorus Ensemble: A new chorus device with more extensive features than the original CF-101 * Sweeper Modulation Effect: A device that combines a phaser, flanger and filter unit into one * Master Bus Compressor: The compressor from the Reason mixer is now available as a rack device * Channel Dynamics: The compressor/expander/gate effect from the Reason mixer is now available as a rack device * Channel EQ: The EQ and filter effect from the Reason mixer is now available as a rack device Rack Extensions developed by Reason Studios during Reason 11 include: * Scenic Hybrid Instrument: a new instrument with cinematic, atmospheric sounds. =Reason 11.1= This minor update to Reason 11 was released on November 22, 2019. It adds an AUv2 version off the Reason Rack Plugin along with some minor improvements and bug fixes. =Reason 11.2= This minor update to Reason 11 was released on February 20, 2020. It adds the ability to drag notes from Redrum, Dr Octo Rex and Matrix to tracks in your host DAW if that is not Reason. It also adds a new device: * Midi Out: A device that sends midi notes from the Reason Rack plugin to the host DAW, giving users more flexibility when working with devices such as players Rack Extensions developed by Reason Studios during Reason 11.2 include: * Beat Map Algorhythmic Drummer: a new player for creating beats. =Reason 11.3= This minor update to Reason 11 was released on May 5, 2020. It adds an AAX version of the Reason Rack plugin so Reason can now be used inside Pro Tools and other software that supports AAX. Devices = Basic devices = *Hardware Interface ‚Äì This handles the connection between software and hardware and supports up to sixty-four separate outputs. As it is integral to Reason's functionality, it cannot be removed. *Mixer 14:2 ‚Äì Reason's mixer is used to group numerous device outputs into a stereo output. It has fourteen stereo channels with level meters, fixed bass and treble EQ and four stereo auxiliary sends. It is possible to mute or solo any given channel, as well as alter its level, pan and auxiliary output level. The console has chaining master inputs to allow several line mixers to be daisy chained together, effectively allowing for an unlimited number of channels. *Line Mixer 6:2 ‚Äì Similar to the Mixer 14:2, and also known as the Micromix, it is a smaller, six channel mixer, with only one auxiliary send and return, no EQ, smaller level controls and limited metering. = Synthesizers = *Europa Shapeshifting Synthesizer is an advanced wavetable synthesizer, inspired by the Thor synth that came a decade prior. It has many functions for morphing and manipulating sounds from buzzing basses to glitch effects. *Grain Sample Manipulator is an advanced graintable synthesizer, capable of playing imported audio samples in a wide variety of ways and includes features to manipulate the sampled audio into completely new sounds. *Monotone Bass Synthesizer is a simple synth with just two oscillators aimed at quickly generating basslines. *Subtractor Analogue Synthesizer ‚Äì This is a polyphonic synthesizer device based on subtractive synthesis, which is the method used in classic, analog synthesizers. Its two oscillators can produce basic waveforms such as square, sawtooth, triangle, and sine. Additional waveforms based on samples can also be generated. The Subtractor device can be fully automated from a controlling device, such as Reason's sequencer. *Thor Polysonic Synthesizer ‚Äì This device simulates a semi-modular synthesizer. Six filter and oscillator slots allow loading up to three different filter modules and three different oscillator modules simultaneously, allowing dialing in novel sounds. A modulation matrix gives full control over signal flow, to modulate anything within Thor. Thor also has a simulation of an analog style step sequencer with more than one twist. This step sequencer can be used as a modulation tool, trigger phrases from specific keys and create arpeggios and percussion lines. *Malstr√∂m Graintable Synthesizer ‚Äì This device creates its sounds using Graintable technology. This technology is a cross between granular synthesis and wavetable synthesis. Malstr√∂m features many filtering and modulation options. It is capable of real-time waveform stretching, spectral modulation, and wavetable sweeping. Malstr√∂m comes with a wide range of Graintables. =Samplers= *NN-19 Digital Sampler ‚Äì This is Reason's original sampler, introduced in the first version. All of its controls can be fully automated from a controlling device. There are two ways to get sound out of NN19: load a single wav/aiff sample or load a sampler patch. Loading a single wav/aiff file will instantly transpose the audio across the keyboard by speeding up or slowing down the playback of the sample. The NN19 can import and play mono or stereo files. *NN-XT Advanced Sampler ‚Äì This is an advanced sampler with many features. It is designed for working with multiple samples which can be assigned to different keys on the keyboard. It can be used for both sound design and instrument emulation. Useful features include alternate sample playback, auto-pitch detection, keyboard zones with individual parameters, and tempo syncable LFOs. = Other instruments = * Klang, Pangea, and Humana are sampled instrument devices designed to create organic sounds. Klang is specialized in tuned percussion, Pangea includes sounds from cultures all over the world, and Humana contains sounds made from human voices. Each of these devices comes with an identical set of built in effects to manipulate the sounds further.https://www.propellerheads.com/en/reason/instruments/klang- pangea-humana * ID-8 is a sample based instrument aimed at quickly providing the building block of a song with sounds like piano, guitar and strings being easily accessible.https://www.propellerheads.com/en/reason/instruments/id-8 * Kong Drum Designer is a hybrid tool that contains multiple synthesizers designed for emulating drums (both acoustic and electronic) and samplers to create drum sets that can then be used in songs. Up to 16 different drum sounds can be programmed in all with their own effects chain. A matrix lets users manipulate how those samples are triggered.https://www.propellerheads.com/en/reason/instruments/kong * Radical Piano is a hypersampled piano instrument. It was first released as a Rack Extension but included in reason starting with version 10.https://www.propellerheads.com/en/reason/instruments/radical-piano * Rytmik Drum Machine lets users load drum samples or sample sets to quickly create beats. Added in Reason 10.4 to be compatible with Reason Compact https://www.propellerheads.com/en/reason/instruments/rytmik-drum-machine = Rhythm sequencers = *Dr. Octo REX Loop Player ‚Äì This update of the Dr.Rex device plays back samples created by the ReCycle (program) in the .rex and .rx2 formats. These formats allow manipulating a sample's tempo without affecting its pitch. Imagine a sample of a drum loop. The loop is 140 bpm and a track is 120 bpm. Instead of stretching the sample, which would change the sample's timbre and pitch, ReCycle slices the loop into little pieces so that each beat gets its own sample. ReCycle also creates a MIDI file with the samples played the way the loop was originally played. The 'octo' in the device's name refers to the fact that up to eight of these samples can be loaded in the device at once. *Redrum Drum Computer ‚Äì This device is a sample- playback drum module with a built in pattern sequencer. It has ten channels that plays samples loaded individually or from a preset kit. In addition to the pattern sequencer, Redrum can also be played from Reason's main sequencer or via MIDI. By combining the pattern sequencer and the main sequencer, one can easily create fills and variations to the patterns without having to create new patterns for every variation. = Mastering = *Master Bus Compressor ‚Äì The compressor from the Reason mixer is now available as a rack devicehttps://www.reasonstudios.com/en/reason/effects/master-bus-compressor *Channel Dynamics ‚Äì The compressor/expander/gate effect from the Reason mixer is now available as a rack devicehttps://www.reasonstudios.com/en/reason/effects/channel-dynamics *Channel EQ ‚Äì The EQ and filter effect from the Reason mixer is now available as a rack devicehttps://www.reasonstudios.com/en/reason/effects/channel-eq *MClass Equalizer ‚Äì This is a 4-band, professional level mastering EQ with low and high shelving bands, two peak filters and a low cut switch. It allows making subtle or drastic frequency adjustments to the audio. *MClass Stereo Imager ‚Äì This splits the incoming audio into low and high frequency bands, and allows adjusting each independently. Increasing the width for the high band while making the low band slightly more mono gives wide, open sounding mixes with a tight low end. *MClass Compressor ‚Äì This is a single-band compressor with a sidechain input for advanced compression such as ducking or de-essing, and CV out for dynamically controlling other devices. *MClass Maximizer ‚Äì This is a tool designed to maximize the volume of Reason tracks, without crushing them or introducing other unwanted artifacts. The Maximizer features a Limiter section - with switchable look-ahead, for distortion-free brickwall limiting - and a Soft Clip section which gently rounds off the edges. = Effects = *Quartet Chorus Ensemble ‚Äì A new chorus device with more extensive features than the original CF-101https://www.reasonstudios.com/en/reason/effects/quartet *Sweeper Modulation Effect ‚Äì A device that combines a phaser, flanger and filter unit into onehttps://www.reasonstudios.com/en/reason/effects/sweeper *RV7000 Advanced Reverb ‚Äì This contains basic reverb controls located on the main panel, and eight separate knobs for algorithms and their parameters, which can be accessed from a fold-out remote when pressed. As of Reason version 8.3, the unit supports convolution reverb, allowing the user to load prepared impulse responses or to create their own. *Scream 4 Distortion ‚Äì With Scream 4's cut and body filters, two parameters for its ten modes including overdrive, distortion, feedback and tape damage, it can be used for digital bit crushing, or regular crushing, or for simulating adding analog warmth to audio. *BV512 Digital Vocoder ‚Äì The BV-512 is a 4 to 512-band vocoder that can modulate sound in several ways, and can also be used as an automated equalizer. *The Echo - A delay device with built in filters, distortion and modulation effects.https://www.propellerheads.com/en/reason/effects/the-echo *Pulveriser - A combination of distortion, compression with built in modulation and filter effects.https://www.propellerheads.com/en/reason/effects/pulveriser *Synchronous - A tool that lets users define three different automation patterns that can be applied to the built in effects. Those effects include 4 distortion options, 4 filter options, delay and reverb as well as volume. The CV in and outputs let you use this device interact with other devices.https://www.propellerheads.com/en/reason/effects/synchronous Originally released as a Rack Extension but included in Reason since version 10. *Alligator Triple Filtered Gate - This device splits the sound into three separate frequency bands. Each band can independently be gated and effects can be applied. The included effects are filter, drive, phaser and delay. On top of that each band can be panned and the volume can be set.https://www.propellerheads.com/en/reason/effects/alligator *Pulsar - This is mainly an advanced dual LFO generator that can be hooked up to other devices via CV connections. But it can be used a s a basic synthesizer as well.https://www.propellerheads.com/en/reason/effects/pulsar Originally released as a Rack Extension but included in Reason since version 9. *Audiomatic - This device lets the user choose from 16 different effects and dial those in. It includes straight forward effects such as Vinyl or Radio that make the sound mimic those sound sources, but it also includes other effects that provide more unexpected results.https://www.propellerheads.com/en/reason/effects/audiomatic Originally released as a Rack Extension but included in Reason since version 9. *Neptune Pitch Adjuster & Voice Synth - This device is designed to provide auto tuning. The scale can be set so any sound going through it will be pitch shifted to fit within that scale. The speed and accuracy can be set to provide either more artificial or more natural sounding resultshttps://www.propellerheads.com/en/reason/effects/neptune *Softube Guitar Amp and Softube Bass Amp - These two devices both model guitar amps where the sound can be sculpted as you would on a physical guitar amp.https://www.propellerheads.com/en/reason/effects/guitar- amphttps://www.propellerheads.com/en/reason/effects/bass-amp = Other effects = Reason also features numerous simple effect devices. *RV-7 Digital Reverb *DDL-1 Digital Delay Line *D-11 Foldback Distortion *ECF-42 Envelope Controlled Filter *CF-101 Chorus/Flanger *PH-90 Phaser *UN-16 Unison *COMP-01 Compressor/Limiter *PEQ-2 Two Band Parametric EQ = Players = * Dual Arpeggio is a set of two individually configurable arpegiators.https://www.propellerheads.com/en/reason/instruments/player- devices#dual-arpeggio * Note Echo will repeat notes automatically when played, but the speed at which this happens can be manipulated and the repeated notes can be transposed up and down.https://www.propellerheads.com/en/reason/instruments/player-devices#note- echo * Scales & Chords is used to do two thins: prevent a user playing notes that don't belong to the current scale, and making chords from the note being played, based on the scale being used.https://www.propellerheads.com/en/reason/instruments/player- devices#scales-chords = Other devices = *Combinator ‚Äì This is a device that allows creating chains of Reason units - instruments, effects, pattern sequencers, and then save them as Combi patches. When a Combi patch is opened, all units in the created setup are instantly loaded, complete with sounds, settings and routings. The Combinator can house an unlimited number of Reason devices, which can all be combined, controlled and manipulated in any way. The Combinator's skinnable front panel holds four rotary controls and four buttons that can all be assigned to any function on any device in a combinator chain. The back of the Combinator reveals two connectors: the Combi input jacks that allow using Combinator as an effect unit. Combinators are the most commonly used devices for song creation due to their flexibility and ability to be 'compacted' for easier viewing and arrangement (visually). Typically each combinator is used as an individual 'instrument' with its own EQ and effects within the unit and accompanied by a 6:2 Mixer and CV Merger/Splitter (see below). this allows greater control of the basic parameters of the patch and allows more manipulation to create the ideal sound without complicated re- routing as the editing is done within the Combinator (pre- combinators output). *Spider Audio & CV Merger & Splitter ‚Äì The Spider Audio utility has two purposes: to merge and to split audio. Spider CV is exactly the same kind of utility as Spider Audio, but here the splitting and merging is performed on CV and gate signals. *Matrix Pattern Sequencer ‚Äì This is an analog-style sequencer with a maximum of 32 steps per pattern and is the part of Reason to use for ReBirth style sequences. The Matrix has 32 patterns and each can be freely sized regardless of what time signature has been chosen in the sequencer. The Resolution selector allows playback of the pattern in a range between 1/2 notes and 1/128 notes. The playback resolution is independent of the sequencer, and the display shows the 32 steps and a little graphic keyboard on the left-hand side will tell what notes are being played. A switch left of the graphical keyboard gives access to five octaves within the programming interface. Moving the mouse over the lower part of the display will allow change of velocity levels. *RPG-8 Monophonic Arpeggiator ‚Äì This contains a pattern section for muting selected notes in an arpeggio and a large display showing values and positions, and the 'Single Note Repeat' function engages the arpeggiator only when two or more simultaneous notes are held down. The 'Manual' mode will arpeggiate notes strictly in the order they were input for realtime arpeggio control. *ReGroove Mixer ‚Äì This applies its timing magic non-destructively and in real time, letting users adjust its settings as music plays. Users can lock all tracks together, or can apply different settings to up to 32 musical elements in a song. Each of the groove channels feature controls for groove amount, slide and shuffle and more detailed settings. The Reason soundbank comes with a selection of groove patches, created from analyzed recordings of real musicians as well as classic groovy tracks. ReFills ReFills compress samples, loops and instrument patches into single files for simple sharing between users, and for selling commercial sample and patch libraries. =Official ReFills= Reason Studios has released the following ReFills for Reason: *Reason Disco School *Reason Soul School - includes Reason Soul Keys Refill *Reason Strings *ElectroMechanical - Available as a free download or relatively cheap CD to registered users of Reason 3.0 or later.

The magazine has a circulation of around 50,000 and was named one of the 50 best magazines in 2003 and 2004 by the Chicago Tribune.  History  Reason was founded in 1968 by Lanny Friedlander (1947‚Äì2011), a student at Boston University, as a more-or-less monthly mimeographed publication. In 1970 it was purchased by Robert W. Poole Jr., Manuel S. Klausner, and Tibor R. Machan, who set it on a more regular publishing schedule. As the monthly print magazine of \\"free minds and free markets\\", it covers politics, culture, and ideas with a mix of news, analysis, commentary, and reviews. During the 1970s and 80s, the magazine's contributors included Milton Friedman, Murray Rothbard, Thomas Szasz, and Thomas Sowell. In 1978, Poole, Klausner, and Machan created the associated Reason Foundation, in order to expand the magazine's ideas into policy research. Marty Zupan joined Reason in 1975, and served through the 1980s as managing editor and editor-in-chief, leaving in 1989. Virginia Postrel was editor-in-chief of the magazine from July 1989 to January 2000. She founded the magazine's website in 1995. Nick Gillespie became editor-in-chief in 2000. Erik Spiekermann, the designer of the Meta typeface, headed a redesign of Reason in 2001, aiming for a look that is \\"cleaner, more modern, making use of the Meta typeface throughout\\". In June 2004, subscribers to Reason magazine received a personalized issue that had their name, and a satellite photo of their home or workplace on the cover. The concept was to demonstrate the power of public databases, as well as the customized printing capabilities of Xeikon's printer, according to then editor-in-chief Nick Gillespie. The move was seen by David Carr of The New York Times as \\"the ultimate in customized publishing\\", as well as \\"a remarkable demonstration of the growing number of ways databases can be harnessed.\\" In 2008, Reasons website was named a Webby Award Honoree in the magazine category. That same year, Matt Welch became magazine's editor-in- chief, with Gillespie becoming editor-in-chief of reason.tv. In 2011, Gillespie and Welch published The Declaration of Independents: How Libertarian Politics Can Fix What's Wrong with America. Katherine Mangu-Ward became the magazine's editor-in-chief in June 2016, with Welch moving to an editor-at- large position. Other Reason editors include Jacob Sullum, Jesse Walker, Brian Doherty, Peter Suderman, and Damon Root; contributors include Ronald Bailey, Greg Beato, Cathy Young, and cartoonist Peter Bagge. In 2017, Reason magazine began hosting The Volokh Conspiracy, a blog written by libertarian and conservative law professors and run by Eugene Volokh. Hit & Run Hit & Run is Reason's group blog. It is maintained and written by the staff of the magazine. It was started in 2002. Then-editor Gillespie and then-Web editor Tim Cavanaugh, both veterans of Suck.com, modeled the blog in some ways after that website. They brought along several other Suck.com writers to contribute, fostered a style in the blog matching that former website's sarcastic attitude, and even the name \\"Hit & Run\\" was taken from what had been a weekly news roundup column on Suck.com. Reason editors referred to this co-opting of the former website as the \\"Suck-ification of Reason\\". In 2005, Hit & Run was named as one of the best political blogs by Playboy. Reason TV Reason magazine produces videos on the YouTube channel ReasonTV.\\"About\\". ReasonTV. YouTube. October 13, 2007. Retrieved October 4, 2019. These include produced short-form documentaries and video editorials, which Nick Gillespie oversees as editor-in-chief. The site produced a series of videos called The Drew Carey Project hosted by comedian Drew Carey. Reason TV partnered with Carey again in 2009 to produce \\"Reason Saves Cleveland,\\" in which Carey suggested free market solutions to his hometown's problems. Since 2010, comedian Remy Munasifi has partnered with ReasonTV to produce parody videos. Since 2017 John Stossel has produced more than 100 commentary segments published on the ReasonTV YouTube channel.

The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 70th Academy Awards. The film stars Fedja van Hu√™t, Jan Decleir, and Betty Schuurman. Plot In the Netherlands of the 1920s, Dreverhaven (Decleir), a dreaded bailiff, is found dead, with a knife sticking out of his stomach. The obvious suspect is Jacob Willem Katadreuffe (Van Hu√™t), an ambitious young lawyer who worked his way up from poverty, always managing to overcome Dreverhaven's personal attacks against him. Katadreuffe was seen leaving Dreverhaven's office on the afternoon of the murder. He is arrested and taken to police headquarters, where he reflects back on the story of his long relationship with Dreverhaven, who, police learn, is also Katadreuffe's father. The story begins when Katadreuffe's taciturn mother, Joba (played by Schuurman), worked as a housekeeper for Dreverhaven. During that time, they had sex only once (it is implied that the encounter was forced upon Joba). She becomes pregnant and leaves her employer to make a living for herself and her son. Time and again, she rejects Dreverhaven's offers by mail of money and marriage. Even as a child, Katadreuffe finds that his path crosses with Dreverhaven, often with dire consequences. When he is arrested for becoming involved in a boyish theft and tells the police that Dreverhaven is his father, Dreverhaven refuses to recognize him as his son. When, as a young man, he unwittingly takes a loan from a bank that Dreverhaven owns to purchase a failed cigar store, Dreverhaven sues him to win the money back and force him into bankruptcy. Still, Katadreuffe manages to pay back the debt, finding a clerical position in the law firm retained to pursue him for his cigar-store debt. He manages to secure this job, even though most of his education is derived from reading an incomplete English-language encyclopedia that he finds as a boy in his mother's apartment; studying this set, he manages to teach himself English, which turns out to be a valuable talent in the eyes of his employers. After paying back the cigar-store debt, Katadreuffe immediately seeks a second loan from Dreverhaven, so that he can finance his education and legal studies and, ultimately, take and pass the bar examination. Dreverhaven agrees, on the condition that he can call back the loan at any time. Despite the bailiff's efforts to hinder his son, Katadreuffe passes his bar examination and qualifies as a lawyer. On the afternoon when his firm holds a celebration of his becoming a lawyer (the day with which the film begins, the day of the murder), Katadreuffe storms into Dreverhaven's office to confront his lifelong tormentor, the bailiff. Katadreuffe reacts with rage to Dreverhaven's congratulations, and his offer of a handshake, and, though he at first turns to leave, he runs toward Dreverhaven and attempts to attack him. After a bloody and angry brawl, Katadreuffe is witnessed leaving the bailiff's office. However, the police discover that Katadreuffe left Dreverhaven at 5:00 p.m., though an examination of the bailiff's body reveals that Dreverhaven died at 11:00 p.m. The police finally reveal to Katadreuffe that Dreverhaven actually committed suicide. After Katadreuffe is cleared, a police official hands him a document, left by Dreverhaven's lawyer, that turns out to be the bailiff's will, which leaves all of his considerable wealth to Katadreuffe. The will is signed \\"Vader\\" (Father).

Early Chinese dynastic histories chronicle tributary relations between Queen Himiko and the Cao Wei Kingdom (220‚Äì265), and record that the Yayoi period people chose her as ruler following decades of warfare among the kings of Wa. Early Japanese histories do not mention Himiko, but historians associate her with legendary figures such as Empress Consort Jing≈´, who was regent (c. 200‚Äì269) in roughly the same era as Himiko. Scholarly debates over the identity of Himiko and the location of her domain, Yamatai, have raged since the late Edo period, with opinions divided between northern Ky≈´sh≈´ or traditional Yamato province in present-day Kinki. The \\"Yamatai controversy,\\" writes Keiji Imamura (1996:188), is \\"the greatest debate over the ancient history of Japan.\\" Historical references The shaman Queen Himiko is recorded in various ancient histories, dating back to 3rd-century China, 8th-century Japan, and 12th-century Korea. The \\"Book of Wei\\" part of the Records of the Three Kingdoms, =Chinese sources= The first historical records of Himiko are found in a Chinese classic text, the c. 297 Records of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguo Zhi ‰∏âÂúãÂøó).

They formerly > comprised more than one hundred communities. During the Han dynasty, [Wa > envoys] appeared at the Court; today, thirty of their communities maintain > intercourse [with us] through envoys and scribes. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:8) This early history describes how Himiko came to the throne: > The country formerly had a man as ruler. For some seventy or eighty years > after that there were disturbances and warfare. Thereupon the people agreed > upon a woman for their ruler. Her name was Himiko [ÂçëÂº•Âëº]. She occupied > herself with magic and sorcery, bewitching the people. Though mature in age, > she remained unmarried. She had a younger brother who assisted her in ruling > the country. After she became the ruler, there were few who saw her. She had > one thousand women as attendants, but only one man. He served her food and > drink and acted as a medium of communication. She resided in a palace > surrounded by towers and stockades, with armed guards in a state of constant > vigilance. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:13) The \\"Records of Wei\\" also records envoys travelling between the Wa and Wei courts. Himiko's emissaries first visited the court of Wei emperor Cao Rui in 238, and he replied: > Herein we address Himiko, Queen of Wa, whom we now officially call a friend > of Wei. [‚Ä¶Your envoys] have arrived here with your tribute, consisting of > four male slaves and six female slaves, together with two pieces of cloth > with designs, each twenty feet in length. You live very far away across the > sea; yet you have sent an embassy with tribute. Your loyalty and filial > piety we appreciate exceedingly. We confer upon you, therefore, the title > \\"Queen of Wa Friendly to Wei,\\" together with the decoration of the gold seal > with purple ribbon. The latter, properly encased, is to be sent to you > through the Governor. We expect you, O Queen, to rule your people in peace > and to endeavor to be devoted and obedient. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:14) Finally, the \\"Records of Wei\\" (tr. Tsunoda 1951:15) records that in 247 when a new governor arrived at Daifang Commandery in Korea, Queen Himiko officially complained of hostilities with , the king of Kuna (ÁãóÂ•¥, literally \\"dog slave\\"), one of the other Wa states. The governor dispatched \\"Chang Ch√™ng, acting Secretary of the Border Guard\\" with a \\"proclamation advising reconciliation\\", and subsequently: > When Himiko passed away, a great mound was raised, more than a hundred paces > in diameter. Over a hundred male and female attendants followed her to the > grave. Then a king was placed on the throne, but the people would not obey > him. Assassination and murder followed; more than one thousand were thus > slain. A relative of Himiko named Iyo [Â£πËàá], a girl of thirteen, was [then] > made queen and order was restored. Ch√™ng issued a proclamation to the effect > that Iyo was the ruler. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:16) Commentators take this as a miscopy of paralleling the Wei Zhi writing Yamatai as Yamaichi. Two other Chinese dynastic histories mentioned Himiko. While both clearly incorporated the above Wei Zhi reports, they made some changes, such as specifying the \\"some seventy or eighty years\\" of Wa wars occurred between 146 and 189, during the reigns of Han Emperors Huan and Ling. The c. 432 Book of Later Han (Hou Han Shu ÂæåÊº¢Êõ∏) says \\"the King of Great Wa resides in the country of Yamadai\\", rather than the Queen: > The Wa dwell on mountainous islands southeast of Han [Korea] in the middle > of the ocean, forming more than one hundred communities. From the time of > the overthrow of Chaoxian [northern Korea] by Emperor Wu (B.C. 140-87), > nearly thirty of these communities have held intercourse with the Han > [dynasty] court by envoys or scribes. Each community has its king, whose > office is hereditary. The King of Great Wa [Yamato] resides in the country > of Yamadai. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:1) ‚Ä¶ > During the reigns of Huan-di (147-168) and Ling-di (168-189), the country of > Wa was in a state of great confusion, war and conflict raging on all sides. > For a number of years, there was no ruler.

She resided in a palace surrounded by towers and stockades > with the protection of armed guards. The laws and customs were strict and > stern. (tr. Tsunoda 1951:2-3) The 636 Book of Sui (Sui Shu ÈöãÊõ∏) changes the number of Himiko's male attendants: > During the reigns of the Emperors Huan and Ling, that country was in great > disorder, and there was no ruler for a period of years. [Then] a woman named > Himiko attracted the populace by means of the practice of magic. The country > became unified and made her queen.

The circumstances under which these books were written is a matter of unending debate, and even if Himiko were known to the authors, they may have purposefully decided not to include her. (Hideyuki 2005) However, they include three imperial-family shamans identified with her: Yamatototohimomosohime-no- Mikoto, the aunt of Emperor Sujin (legendary 10th Japanese emperor, r. 97-30 BC) and daughter of Emperor K≈çrei; Yamatohime-no-mikoto, the daughter of Emperor Suinin (legendary 11th, r. 29 BC-70 AD); and Empress Jing≈´ (r. c. 209-269 AD), the wife of Emperor Ch≈´ai (legendary 14th emperor, r. 192-200 AD). These dates, however, are not historically verified. One remarkable exception to early Japanese histories overlooking Himiko is the Nihon Shoki quoting the Wei Zhi three times. In 239, \\"the queen [Â•≥Áéã] of Wa\\" sent envoys to Wei; in 240, they returned \\"charged with an Imperial rescript and a seal and ribbon;\\" and in 243, \\"the ruler [Áéã \\"king\\"] of Wa again sent high officers as envoys with tribute\\" (tr. Aston 1924:245-6). It is revealing that the Nihon Shoki editors chose to omit the Wei Zhi particulars about Himiko. , the shaman aunt of Emperor Sujin, supposedly committed suicide after learning her husband was a trickster snake-god. The Kojiki does not mention her, but the Nihon Shoki describes her as \\"the Emperor's aunt by the father's side, a shrewd and intelligent person, who could foresee the future\\" (tr. Aston 1924:156). After a series of national calamities, the Emperor \\"assembled the 80 myriads of Deities\\" and inquired by divination. Yamato-totohi-momoso was inspired by ≈åmononushi-nushi (\\"Great Deity of All Deities and Spirits\\", tr. Hori 1968:193) to say. \\"Why is the Emperor grieved at the disordered state of the country? If he duly did us reverent worship it would assuredly become pacified of itself.\\" The Emperor inquired, saying: \\"What God is it that thus instructs me?\\" The answer was: \\"I am the God who dwells within the borders of the land of Yamato, and my name is Oho-mono-nushi no Kami.\\" (tr. Aston 1924:152) While imperial worship of this god (from Mount Miwa) was \\"without effect\\", Yamato-totohi- momoso later married him. > After this Yamato-toto-hi-momo-so-bime no Mikoto became the wife of Oho- > mono-nushi no Kami. This God, however, was never seen in the day-time, but > at night. Yamato-toto-hi-momo-so-bime no Mikoto said to her husband: \\"As my > Lord is never seen in the day-time, I am unable to view his august > countenance distinctly; I beseech him therefore to delay a while, that in > the morning I may look upon the majesty of his beauty.\\" The Great God > answered and said: \\"What thou sayest is clearly right. To-morrow morning I > will enter thy toilet-case and stay there. I pray thee be not alarmed at my > form.\\" Yamato-toto-hi-momo-so-bime no Mikoto wondered secretly in her heart > at this. Waiting until daybreak, she looked into her toilet-case. There was > there a beautiful little snake, of the length and thickness of the cord of a > garment. Thereupon she was frightened, and uttered an exclamation. The Great > God was ashamed, and changing suddenly into human form, spake to his wife, > and said: \\"Thou didst not contain thyself, but hast caused me shame; I will > in my turn put thee to shame.\\" So treading the Great Void, he ascended to > Mount Mimoro.

(tr. > Aston 1924:158-9) The Kofun in Sakurai, Nara is associated with this legend. , the daughter of Emperor Suinin, supposedly founded the Ise Shrine to the sun-goddess Amaterasu. The Kojiki records her as the fourth of Suinin's five children, \\"Her Augustness Yamato-hime, (was the high-priestess of the temple of the Great Deity of Ise)\\" (tr. Chamberlain 1919:227). The Nihon Shoki likewise records \\"Yamato-hime no Mikoto\\" (tr. Aston 1924:150) and provides more details. The Emperor assigned Yamatohime to find a permanent location for Amaterasu's shrine, and after wandering for years, the sun-goddess instructed her to build it at Ise \\"where she first descended from Heaven\\" (tr. Aston 1924:176). Empress Consort Jing≈´ (or Jing≈ç Á•ûÂäü) supposedly served as regent after the death of her husband Emperor Ch≈´ai (c. 200) until the accession of her son Emperor ≈åjin (legendary 15th emperor, r. 270-310). The Kojiki (Chamberlain 1919:283-332) and Nihon Shoki (Aston 1924:217-271) have similar accounts. Emperor Ch≈´ai wanted to invade Kumaso, and while he was consulting with his ministers, Jing≈´ conveyed a shamanistic message that he should invade Silla instead. Compare these. > Her Augustness Princess Okinaga-tarashi, was at that time, divinely > possessed ‚Ä¶ charged him with this instruction and counsel: \\"There is a land > to the Westward, and in that land is abundance of various treasures dazzling > to the eye, from gold and silver downwards. I will now bestow this land upon > thee.\\" (tr. Chamberlain 1919:284-5). At this time a certain God inspired the > Empress and instructed her, saying: \\"Why should the Emperor be troubled > because the Kumaso do not yield submission? It is a land wanting in > backbone. Is it worth while raising an army to attack it? There is a better > land than this, a land of treasure, which may be compared to the aspect of a > beautiful woman ‚Äì the land of Mukatsu [Opposite; Across], dazzling to the > eyes. In that land there are gold and silver and bright colours in plenty. > It is called the Land of Silla of the coverlet of paper-mulberry. If thou > worshippest me aright, the land will assuredly yield submission freely, and > the edge of thy sword shall not be all stained with blood.\\" (tr. Aston > 1924:221). (The 2005:284 reprint of Chamberlain adds a footnote after \\"possessed\\": \\"Himeko [sic] in the Chinese historical notices of Japan was skilled in magic, with which she deluded the people.\\") The Emperor thought the gods were lying, said he had only seen ocean to the West, and then died, either immediately (Kojiki) or after invading Kumaso (Nihon Shoki). Jing≈´ allegedly discovered she was pregnant, personally planned and led a successful conquest of Silla, gave birth to the future emperor, and returned to rule Yamato. The Nihon Shoki (tr. Aston 1924:225) adds that since Jing≈´ wanted to learn which gods had cursed Ch≈´ai, she constructed a shamanic \\"palace of worship\\", \\"discharged in person the office of priest\\", and heard the gods reveal themselves as coming from Ise (Amaterasu) and Mukatsu (an unnamed Korean divinity). Although the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki myth-histories called Jing≈´ first of the Japanese empresses, Meiji period historians removed her from the List of Emperors of Japan, leaving Empress Suiko (r. 593-628) as the first historically verifiable female Japanese ruler. =Korean sources= The oldest Korean history book, the 1145 Samguk Sagi (‰∏âÂúãÂè≤Ë®ò \\"Chronicles of the Three [Korean] Kingdoms\\") records that Queen Himiko sent an emissary to King Adalla of Silla in May 173 (Saeki 1988:35, 113, 154). Interpretations Researchers have struggled to reconcile Himiko/Pimiko between the Chinese and Japanese historical sources above. While the Wei Zhi described her as an important ruler in 3rd-century Japan, early Japanese historians purposely avoided naming Himiko, even when the Nihon Shoki quoted the Wei Zhi about envoys from Wa. =Name= The three Chinese characters (simplified: ) transcribing the Wa regent's name are read or in Modern Japanese and or in Modern Standard Chinese. However, these contemporary readings differ considerably from how \\"Himiko\\" was pronounced in the 3rd century, both by speakers of the unknown Wa-language and by Chinese scribes who transcribed it. While transliteration into Chinese characters of foreign words is complex; the choice of these three particular characters is puzzling, with literal meanings Âçë \\"low; inferior; humble\\", ÂΩå (Âº•) \\"fill, cover; full; whole, complete\\", and Âëº \\"breathe out; exhale; cry out; call\\". In terms of historical Chinese phonology, modern beimihu () is simpler than its presumed 3rd-century late Old Chinese or early Middle Chinese pronunciation. Compare the following reconstructions of the name in \\"Archaic\\" or \\"Middle Chinese\\" (Bernhard Karlgren, Li Fanggui, and William H. Baxter), \\"Early Middle Chinese\\" (Edwin G. Pulleyblank), and, historically closest, \\"Late Han Chinese\\" (Axel Schuessler). *pji·∏ômji·∏ôœáuo (Karlgren) *pjiemjieœáwo (Li) *pjiumjieXxu (Baxter) *pjimjiœá…î or pji…ôÃåmji…ôÃåœá…î (Pulleyblank) *piemieh…ë (Schuessler) To simplify without using special symbols, the first two syllables with p(j)- and m(j)- initial consonants share -i(e) final vowels, and the third has either a voiceless fricative X- or a voiced fricative h- plus a back mid vowel -u(o). Thus, \\"Himiko\\" could be hypothetically reconstructed as *P(j)i(e)m(j)i(e)hu(o). In terms of historical Japanese phonology, the accepted modern reading of himiko would regularly correspond to Old Japanese *Fimeko. However, Roy Andrew Miller says *Fimeko is a lexicographic error deriving from the Wei Zhi transcriptions. > Most perplexing of the entire list is the name of the queen of the Yeh- > ma-t'ai community, Pi-mi-hu, Middle Chinese pji·∏ô-mji·∏ô-œáuo. This has > traditionally been explained and understood in Japan as a transcription of a > supposed Old Japanese form *Fimeko, said to be an early term meaning \\"high > born woman; princess,\\" and to derive from Old Japanese Fime [or Fi1me1] > (also sometimes Fim√´ [Fi1me2]), a laudatory title for women going with Fiko > [Fi1ko1] for men. Later Fime comes to mean \\"princess,\\" but this meaning is > anachronistic for the earlier texts. ‚Ä¶ The difficulty concerns the supposed > Old Japanese word *Fimeko. Even though such a form has found its way into a > few modern Japanese dictionaries (for example even Kindaiichi's otherwise > generally reliable Jikai), it is in fact simply one of the ghost words of > Japanese lexicography; when it does appear in modern lexical sources, it is > a \\"made-up\\" form listed there solely on the basis of the Wei chih account of > early Japan. There never was an Old Japanese *Fimeko; furthermore, the > Middle Chinese spirant œá of the transcription suggests that the final > element of the unknown original term did not correspond to Old Japanese -ko > [-ko1], which is rendered elsewhere ‚Äì in Fiko [Fi1ko1], for example ‚Äì with > Middle Chinese -k- as one would expect. The final element of this > transcription, then, remains obscure, thought there is certainly a good > chance that the first portion does correspond to a form related to Old > Japanese Fime. Beyond that, it is at present impossible to go. (1967:22) Hime < Old Japanese Fi1me1 (Âß´ \\"young noblewoman; princess\\"), explains Miller, etymologically derives from hi < Fi1 (Êó• \\"sun\\") and me < me1 (Â•≥ \\"woman\\"). Tsunoda (1951:5) notes \\"Pimiko is from an archaic Japanese title, himeko, meaning 'princess',\\" that is, hime with the female name suffix , viz. the uncommon given name Himeko. Other Amaterasu-related etymological proposals for the Japanese name Himiko involve and ; or their combination hime-miko \\"princess-priestess\\". Bentley (2008:18-20) considers the Paekche word * 'west', the honorific prefix * and * 'heir' and thus interprets as 'the honorific heir of the west'. Although man'y≈çgana, Chinese characters used to spell out Japanese sounds, rose in prominence some time after the Wei Zhi, it is notable that the man'y≈çgana spelling could be hypothetically reconstructed as *Pjimjiwo. This could be construed as undercutting Tsunoda's hypothesis, which requires final -ko, and as possibly bolstering Bentley's argument. =Identity and historicity= Identifying Himiko/Pimiko of Wa is straightforward within the history of China, but problematic within the history of Japan. The 3rd-century Chinese Wei Zhi (\\"Records of Wei\\") provides details about shaman Queen Himiko and her communications with Emperors Cao Rui and Cao Fang. The 8th-century Japanese Kojiki (\\"Records of Ancient Matters\\") and Nihon Shoki (\\"Chronicles of Japan\\", which quotes the Wei Zhi) disregard Himiko, unless she was the subtext behind their accounts of Empress Jing≈´, Yamatohime-no-mikoto, or Yamatototohimomosohime-no-Mikoto. None of these three legendary Japanese royal shamans adequately corresponds with the Chinese chronology and description of Himiko. Assuming the Wei Zhi account that Himiko died around 248, if one accepts the dubious Japanese traditional dating, then she was closer to the 3rd-century AD Empress Jing≈´ than to the 1st-century BC Yamatohime-no-mikoto and Yamato-totohi-momoso-hime. On the other hand, if one accepts the postdating adjustments prior to the 4th century, then Himiko was closer to these Yamato-named shamans. Neither Kojiki nor Nihon Shoki mentions Himiko or any of the salient topics that she was unmarried, was chosen as ruler by the people, had a younger brother who helped rule (unless this refers to Jing≈´'s son), or had numerous (figuratively \\"1000\\") female attendants. William Wayne reviews the history of scholarly debates over Himiko and her domain Yamatai. The Edo-period philosophers Arai Hakuseki and Motoori Norinaga began the controversies over whether Yamatai was located in Kyushu or Yamato and whether the Wei Zhi or the Nihon Shoki was historically more trustworthy. The Confucianist Arai accepted the Chinese history as more reliable, and first equated Himiko with Jing≈´ and Yamatai with Yamato. The Kokugaku scholar Motoori accepted the traditional Japanese myth-history as more reliable, and dismissed its Wei Zhi quotations as later accretions. He hypothesized that a king from Kumaso sent emissaries who masqueraded as Jing≈´'s officials to the Wei court, thus leading Wei to mistake them for representatives of Himiko. says, \\"Motoori's usurpation hypothesis (gisen setsu) carried great weight for the next century.\\" Rather than Yamataikoku, Himiko may have been linked with Nakoku, quoted as \\"the Na state of Wa\\" in Kyushu, for which was sent a golden royal seal, by Emperor Guangwu of the Han dynasty. Na is said to have existed from the 1st century to the early 3rd century, and seems to have been independent or even a rival of the Japanese Emperors in the Yamato province. After the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Japanese historians adopted European historical scholarship, especially the source-based methodology of Leopold von Ranke. Naka Michiyo believed the Nihon Shoki chronology was inaccurate prior to the 4th century, and thus \\"Jing≈´ became a fourth-century queen whose reign could not possibly have coincided with Himiko's.\\" The sinologist Shiratori Kurakichi proposed the Nihon Shoki compilers were tempted to associate Jing≈´ with the religious powers of Himiko. Nait≈ç Torajir≈ç argued that Himiko was the high priestess of the Ise shrine Yamatohime-no-mikoto and that Wa armies obtained control of southern Korea. Some later Japanese historians reframed Himiko in terms of Marxist historiography. Masaaki Ueda argued that \\"Himiko's was a despotic state with a generalized slave system\\" , while Mitsusada Inoue idealized Yamatai as a \\"balance of small states\\" with communal property and popular political expression. Following the late 1960s \\"Yamatai boom\\", when numerous Japanese historians, linguists, and archeologists published reevaluations of Himiko and Yamatai, the debate was joined by Japanese nationalists, mystery writers, and amateur scholars. In Japanese historical and archeological periodization, the 2nd- and 3rd-century era of Queen Himiko was between late Yayoi period and early Kofun period. Kofun (Âè§Â¢≥ \\"old tumulus\\") refers to characteristic keyhole-shaped burial mounds, and the Wei Zhi noting \\"a great mound was raised, more than a hundred paces in diameter\\" for Pimiko's tomb, may well be the earliest written record of a kofun. Several archeological excavations of Yayoi and Kofun sites in kinki region, have revealed Chinese-style bronze mirrors, called shinju-kyo (Á•ûÁç£Èè° \\"mirror decorated with gods and animals\\"). Many scholars who support the Kinki theory associate these shinju-kyo with the \\"one hundred bronze mirrors\\" that the Wei Zhi records Emperor Cao Rui presented to Queen Himiko, while other scholars oppose it (, 1999). Hashihaka kofun in Sakurai, Nara was given a recent boost by radio-carbon dating circa 240‚Äì60 . The early Chinese records of Himiko/Pimiko and her Yamatai polity remain something of a Rorschach test. To different interpreters, this early Japanese shaman queen can appear as evidence of communalism (Marxists), J≈çmon priestess rulers (Feminist history), Japanese conquest of Korea , Mongolian conquest of Japan (Namio Egami's \\"horserider theory\\"), the imperial system originating with tandem rule by a female shaman and male monarch , the \\"patriarchal revolution\\" replacing female deities and priestesses with male counterparts , or a shamanic advisor to the federation of Wa chieftains who \\"must have looked like a ruling queen to Chinese envoys\\" . = Modern depictions = Depictions of Himiko in Japanese popular media take one of three archetypes: Himiko as a wise, old ruler; Himiko the cute and spunky shaman; or Himiko as a seductive sorceress. She is associated with several ritual objects including the dotaku - two large bronze bells ritually used at the end of the Yayoi period - as well as the sakaki branch and Chinese bronze mirrors. Wei zhi described Himiko's shamanism as guidao, or Japanese kido, a type of Daoist folk religion. As such, Himiko is sometimes negatively associated with black magic or demons. Ruling in the transitional period between the Yayoi and Kofun eras, depictions of Himiko often display her wearing clothing originating from a variety of time periods, often embodied masculine elements. A queen during the late Yayoi, Himiko likely wore a one-piece, wide-sleeved kosode under a vest and sash. She is also often depicted wearing magatama beads and a diadem. However, no one can be certain what Himiko wore. Himiko also receives wicked interpretations, such as a sorceress or tyrant. Such depictions usually cast Himiko as a seductress in sexually revealing clothing, large breasts, and compromising positions, seeming to assert that Himiko's power arose from nefarious sexual appeal. One such depiction appears in the online role-playing game Atlantica Online, in which Himiko appears a steampunk mercenary in revealing costume. These depictions cater largely to the otaku fan base.  Manga and Graphic Novels  Himiko has appeared as a subject in various manga issues. She has appeared on the cover of Fujiwara Kamui's Himiko: Sh≈´kan manga Nihonshi and on Gakken's manga Nihon no Rekishi by ≈åishi Manabu, Takano Kazuhiro, and Himekawa Akira.  Town mascots  Himiko's legend has been used to market a variety of objects. Various small towns seek to use Himiko as their mascot, claiming their town as her birthplace, although the archaeological evidence supports regions in the Nara basin as her capital. Yoshinogari City and Sakurai City in Nara prefecture both employ images of Himiko to attract tourists, using images such as chibi Himiko-chan welcoming travelers to the region. Anime and video games The anime series and Playstation game Legend of Himiko features time travel between ancient Yamatai and modern Japan, with Himiko eventually helping to save Yamatai. Himiko was featured as one of the supporting characters in the video game ≈åkami, a game which takes many Japanese folktales and myths to tell the story of the white wolf Amaterasu and her quest to free Japan from darkness. Himiko was featured in the 2013 Tomb Raider reboot and the 2018 Tomb Raider film as a plot device. Himiko also appears in the mobile game Fate/Grand Order as a limited 5-Star Ruler-class Servant. She debuted during the Ultra-Ancient Shinsengumi Biographies GUDAGUDA Yamatai-koku 2020 event.  Sales  Sanrio has also created a Himiko-inspired keychain. Researcher Laura Miller recounts eating a dish named for Himiko at Shinobuan Cafe in Moriyama City, where the name apparently gave rise to the popularity of the dish.  Himiko contests  Queen Himiko Contests take place in small towns offering cash prizes to women over the age of eighteen on the basis of charm and appearance. One of the earliest of these contests began in Yamatokoriyama in Nara. One such contest, Himikon, takes place in Moriyama City. Asakura in Kyushu also holds a Himiko contest during its annual Yamataikoku Festival of Flowers. Namesake An Amagi Railway train, Himiko, at Kiyama Station A water taxi in Tokyo Bay named Himiko The proper name Himiko has been diversely applied, not only in Japanese society but also in other realms such as astronomy. Himiko (ÂçëÂº•Âëº) is a train on the Amagi Railway Amagi Line and a water bus of Tokyo Cruise Ship designed by Leiji Matsumoto.Miller, Laura. 2014. \\"Rebranding Himiko, the Shaman Queen of Ancient History.\\" In Mechademia, An Annual Forum for Anime, Manga and the Fan Arts: Issue #9: Origins.

Early life  The son of Presbyterian minister Noble J. Brann, he was born in Humboldt, Illinois. When his mother died in 1857, he was sent by his father to live with William and Mary Hawkins, where he stayed until 1868. That year, he ran away from home and took odd jobs in several cities, including working as a painter's helper, a bellboy at a hotel, manager of an opera company, a pitcher in semiprofessional baseball, and a fireman and brakeman on a locomotive. A job in a print shop turned Brann's interest toward journalism, and he became a cub reporter. As his career progressed, he worked in St. Louis, Galveston, Houston, and San Antonio. While in Rochelle, Illinois in 1877, he married Carrie Belle Martin, with whom he had one son and two daughters. Career During the 1880s Brann became to take his career in journalism seriously and traveled around the country working for several significant newspapers, including the St. Louis Globe Democrat, the Galveston Evening Tribune, and the Galveston News. At the same time, Brann registered three plays with the Library of Congress: Cleon, That American Woman, and Retribution. Despite his growing success, Brann's family was shaken by the suicide of his twelve-year-old daughter Inez in 1890, which greatly agonized Brann. Brann coped with this tragedy, and was inspired to continue to strive towards a successful career in writing and journalism. In 1891, only one year after his daughter's death, Brann moved to Austin, Texas to write for the Austin Statesman. After only a short time, however, he decided to attempt to write his own paper, and invested a significant chunk of his personal savings into the Iconoclast. That paper quickly failed, and Brann went back to working for other Texas newspapers, the San Antonio Express and the Houston Post. =Waco Iconoclast= In 1894 Brann moved to Waco, Texas, to become an editor with the Waco Daily News. By February 1895 he had decided to attempt to revive the Iconoclast, and this time the paper was successful, with a circulation nearing 100,000 people. With this new platform to communicate his views, Brann quickly became known for his stinging, often hateful attacks on various groups that drew his ire, including Baptists, Episcopalians, the British, blacks, and Baylor University. Brann attacked perceived hypocrisy from the Baptists with his seething prose, saying \\"I have nothing against the Baptists. I just believe they were not held under long enough\\". He devoted many paragraphs to his hatred of the wealthy eastern social elites, such as the Vanderbilt family, and deplored their marriages to titled Europeans. He characterized such marriages as diluting the elites' already-debased American stock with worthless foreign blood. He was equally critical of the New York social scene. Baylor University, the prominent Baptist institution in Waco, drew constant criticism from Brann. He set off a scandal with allegations that Baylor President Rufus Burleson's son-in-law's brother Steen Morris, who lived with the Burleson family, had impregnated a student from Brazil. He alleged that male faculty members were having sexual relations with female students and any father sending his daughter to Baylor would be risking her rape. In Brann's view Baylor was, as he published, \\"A factory for the manufacture of ministers and magdalenes.\\" William Cowper Brann Collection #45, The Texas Collection, Baylor University. Brann's constant attacks on the university enraged many of its supporters, and, on October 2, 1897, he was kidnapped by Baylor students who demanded that he retract his statements. Four days later, Brann was beaten by three men, including a local Baptist judge, who were angry that he had not left town. Legacy and death On April 1, 1898, Brann was walking alone on Waco's Fourth Street when he was shot in the back by Tom Davis, a Baylor supporter whose daughter was a student at the University. After being shot, Brann turned, drew his pistol, and fired multiple shots at Davis, who fell, mortally wounded, in the doorway of the Jake French Cigar Store. Brann was shot through the left lung with the bullet exiting his chest. He was forced to walk to the city jail but later escorted home by friends. Both Davis and Brann died the next day. Brann is buried in Oakwood Cemetery, Waco. Engraved on Brann's monument is the word TRUTH, and beneath it is a profile of Brann with a bullet hole in it. Brann remains a controversial figure to this day.

Redmen Museum, Waco Texas Personal life Brann married Carrie Belle Martin on March 3, 1877, in Rochelle, Illinois. They had three children. Their daughter, Inez, died at age 12 following a confrontation with her father regarding the attentions of a young boy who left flowers at the house for Inez, whom Brann accused of encouraging the boy's interest. Her denial led him to accuse her of lying. The next morning, her mother and father found her dead after she had taken morphine. She left a note that said, in part, \\"I don‚Äôt want to live. I could never be as good as you want me to.‚Äù Papers Brann's papers are housed at the Harry Ransom Center of The University of Texas at Austin. Works * The Complete Works of Brann the Iconoclast.

Background He was born in the city of Comayag√ºela, Honduras. His wife, Bessie Watson, was an American citizen with whom he had two daughters. He completed university studies in the National Autonomous University of Honduras where he earned a bachelor's degree in Juridical and Social Sciences. Later, Reina continued his postgraduate studies in the cities of London and Paris. Political career Throughout his long political career Reina held a number of political governmental and international jobs, including judge in the court of Tegucigalpa, peace member of the international court of The Hague, Ambassador of Honduras to France, and president of the Central Executive Council (CCE) of the Liberal Party, among other important positions. Reina was arrested several times for his political activities in opposition to the military governments during his younger years. The first time was in 1944 for protesting against dictator Tiburcio Car√≠as. Later in the 1960s he was sent to prison twice by General Oswaldo L√≥pez, who had taken over the Honduran government through the use of military force. This led Reina to become a fierce defender of human rights throughout the rest of his life. In 1979 he was nominated president of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights of the Organization of American States. President (1994‚Äì1998) Carlos Reina became president in November 1993, with the Liberal Party of Honduras (PLH, Partido liberal de Honduras), after defeating Oswaldo Ramos, the candidate of the National Party of Honduras with 56% of the vote. He was accompanied by his vice presidential candidate: retired General Walter L√≥pez, the politician Juan de la Cruz Avelar and the lady Guadalupe Jerezano Mej√≠a. On January 27, 1994 Reina replaced president Rafael Leonardo Callejas. Reina inherited a relatively difficult economic situation from the existing nationalist administration. Foreign debt weighed heavily on the economy of the country: debt service represented 40% of Honduran exports. Even though approximately 700 million dollars were condoned to Honduras, the debt 'was' still higher than that it had been at the beginnings of 1990. In his first presidential speech Reina launched his moral revolution: \\" I pledge my word of honor before God, before the people and before history, that we will go forward in this enterprise that we have imposed upon ourselves. We will defeat corruption; we will give currency to social liberalism. We will see the moral revolution to its end.\\" The issue of whether his plan was a success or a failure is still highly controversial. One of Carlos Roberto Reina's main objectives during his government was the reform of the Armed Forces. His reforms were mostly realized by the end of his first year in office. The first one was the total transfer of all power in hands of military men to civilian authorities, followed by the abolition of compulsory military service in the country. These and other reforms to the military are also controversial to the ruling elites, they believed it fomented gangs, by eliminating a source of employment and education for young men. Reina's death Carlos Roberto Reina finished his presidency on January 27, 1998. Later, in October 1998, Reina began his period as president of the Central American Parliament (Parlac√©n), where he remained until October 28, 1999. Finally on August 19, 2003, Carlos Roberto Reina committed suicide from a gunshot at the age of 77. His brother revealed that Reina was suffering from health issues relating to the gallbladder and pancreas.

In 1861, Rogers founded the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Rogers, William B., Chairman, The Committee of Associated Institutions of Science and Arts, \\"Objects and Plan of an Institute of Technology: including a Society of Arts, a Museum of Arts, and a School of Industrial Science; proposed to be established in Boston\\" - Boston, 1861, and archived at the MIT Libraries Collection. The university opened in 1865 after the American Civil War. Because of his affiliation with Virginia, Mount Rogers, the highest peak in the state, is named after him. Biography =Early life= Rogers was born on December 7, 1804, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was the second son of Patrick Kerr Rogers and Hannah Blythe and was of Irish, Scottish, and English extraction. Patrick Rogers was born in Ireland and had immigrated at the end of the 18th century to America, where he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and practiced medicine. When William Barton was born, Patrick Rogers was tutor at Penn. In 1819 Patrick Rogers became professor of natural philosophy and mathematics at the College of William and Mary, where he remained until his death in 1828. William Barton Rogers had three brothers: James Blythe Rogers (1802‚Äì1852), Henry Darwin Rogers (1808‚Äì1866), and Robert Empie Rogers (1813‚Äì1884). The Rogers brothers would each grow up to be distinguished scientists.Elizabeth Andrews, Nora Murphy, and Tom Rosko, \\"William Barton Rogers: MIT's Visionary Founder,\\" 2004. =Education and scientific career= Rogers was educated by his father, attended the public schools of Baltimore, Maryland, and also graduated from the College of William and Mary. He delivered a series of lectures on science before the Maryland Institute in 1827, and succeeded his father as professor of natural philosophy and chemistry at William and Mary in 1828, where he remained until 1835. During this time, he carried on investigations on dew and on the voltaic battery, and prepared a series of papers on the greensand and calcareous marl minerals of eastern Virginia and their value as fertilizers. In 1833, his brother Henry had returned from England filled with enthusiasm for geology, and this had prompted Rogers to begin studies in the field. The practical value of his article on greensand caught the eye of the Virginia legislature. Rogers took this opportunity to lobby for a geological survey of Virginia, and he was called upon to organize it in 1835. By 1835, his brother Henry was state geologist of Pennsylvania, and together the brothers unfolded the historical geology of the Appalachian chain. Among their joint special investigations were the study of the solvent action of water on various minerals and rocks, and the demonstration that \\"coal beds stand in close genetic relation to the amount of disturbance to which the inclosing strata have been submitted, the coal becoming harder and containing less volatile matter as the evidence of the disturbance increases\\". In modern terms, this was the realization that the geological process of metamorphism had gradually transformed softer grades of coal, such as lignite, into harder grades, such as anthracite. Together, the brothers published a paper on \\"The Laws of Structure of the more Disturbed Zones of the Earth's Crust\\", in which the wave theory of mountain chains was first announced. This was followed later by William Rogers' statement of the law of distribution of geological faults. These pioneering works contributed to a better understanding of the vast coal beds underlying some parts of the Appalachian region, and helped pave the way for the Industrial Revolution in the United States. In 1842 the work of the survey closed. State revenues had shrunk beginning in 1837, and the funding for the survey had been cut back. Meanwhile, Rogers had published six \\"Reports of the Geological Survey of the State of Virginia\\" (Richmond, 1836‚Äì40), though there were few copies, and recognition of their significance was slow to develop. They were later compiled by Jed Hotchkiss and issued in one volume with a map as Papers on the Geology of Virginia (New York, 1884). In 1835 Rogers also began serving as professor of \\"natural philosophy\\" at the University of Virginia (UVa). There he added mineralogy and geology to the curriculum, and did original research in geology, chemistry and physics. While he was chair of the department of philosophy at UVA, he vigorously defended to the Virginia State Legislature the University's refusal to award honorary degrees, a policy which continues today. (Later, MIT would adopt a similar policy from its beginning, and continuing to the present).:\\"MIT's founder, William Barton Rogers, regarded the practice of giving honorary degrees as 'literary almsgiving ... of spurious merit and noisy popularity ... ' Rogers was a geologist from the University of Virginia who believed in Thomas Jefferson's policy barring honorary degrees at the university, which was founded in 1819.\\" During the time Rogers lived in Virginia, he was a slaveowner, with two slaves in his household in 1840 and six slaves in 1850; one, his cook, was Isabella Gibbons. In 1849, he married Emma Savage of Boston. In 1853 he resigned from the University of Virginia, moving to Boston for two principal reasons. First, he wanted to increase his participation in scientific circles under the auspices of the Boston Society of Natural History and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, in whose proceedings and in the American Journal of Science his papers had been published while at UVa. Second, and more importantly, Rogers wanted to implement his innovative scheme for technical education (which could not be achieved within the structure and institutional focuses of UVa), in which he desired to have associated, on one side, scientific research and investigation on the largest scale and, on the other side, agencies for the popular diffusion of useful knowledge. This project continued to occupy his attention until it culminated in the chartering of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1861), of which he became first president. To raise funds and public awareness of his new Institute, Rogers delivered a course of lectures before the Lowell Institute on \\"The Application of Science to the Arts\\" in 1862. In 1861, he was appointed inspector of gas and gas meters for the state of Massachusetts, a post he accepted reluctantly. During his service, he improved the standards of measurement. =MIT Presidency= For more detail, see History of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. An act of the Massachusetts State Legislature incorporated MIT in 1861, and Rogers became its first president in 1862. He served as president of MIT until 1870, when he stood down because of declining health. By necessity, he returned to office in 1878 and continued to 1881, when he was made professor emeritus of physics and geology, which position he had held while he was president. He died after collapsing during a speech at MIT's 1882 commencement exercises. According to legend his last words were \\"bituminous coal\\":http://bituminouscoal.mit.edu/about = Other affiliations = Rogers was chairman of the Association of American Geologists and Naturalists (AAGN; organized 1840) in 1845 and again in 1847, and contributed important memoirs to its Transactions, including observations on the temperature of coal mines in eastern Virginia. In 1847 he also called to order the first meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), an enlargement of the AAGN. He was president of the AAAS in 1875, and elected its first honorary fellow in 1881, as a special mark of distinction. He was active in founding the American Social Science Association and its first president; also he was one of the corporate members of the National Academy of Sciences, and its president from 1878 until his death. In 1866, Harvard gave him the degree of LL.D.

He was the son of Emperor Y≈çmei and his consort, Princess Anahobe no Hashihito, who was also Y≈çmei's younger half-sister. His parents were relatives of the ruling Soga clan and also he was involved in the defeat of the rival Mononobe clan. The primary source of the life and accomplishments of Prince Sh≈çtoku comes from the Nihon Shoki. Over successive generations, a devotional cult arose around the figure of Prince Sh≈çtoku for the protection of Japan, the Imperial Family, and for Buddhism. Key religious figures such as Saich≈ç, Shinran and others claimed inspiration or visions attributed to Prince Sh≈çtoku. Cultural and political role Shotoku Taishi by Kogan Zenji According to tradition, Sh≈çtoku was appointed regent (Sessh≈ç) in 593 by Empress Suiko (554‚Äì628), his aunt. Sh≈çtoku, inspired by the Buddha's teachings, succeeded in establishing a centralized government during his reign. In 603, he established the Twelve Level Cap and Rank System at the court. He is credited with promulgating a Seventeen-article constitution. The Prince was an ardent Buddhist and is traditionally attributed the authorship of the Sangy≈ç Gisho or \\"Annotated Commentaries on the Three Sutras\\" (the Lotus Sutra, the Vimalakirti Sutra, and the ≈örƒ´mƒÅlƒÅdevƒ´ Si·πÉhanƒÅda S≈´tra). The first of these commentaries, Hokke Gisho, is traditionally dated to 615 and thus regarded as \\"the first Japanese text\\", in turn making Sh≈çtoku the first Japanese writer. A legend claims that when Bodhidharma came to Japan, he met with Prince Sh≈çtoku whilst under the guise of a starving beggar. The Prince asked the beggar to identify himself, but the man did not reply. Instead of going ahead, Sh≈çtoku gave him food, drink, and covered him with his purple garment, telling him to \\"lie in peace\\". The Prince then sang for the starving man. Alas! For The wayfarer lying And hungered for rice On the hill of Kataoka (The sunshiny) Art thou become Parentless? Hast thou no lord Flourishing as a bamboo? Alas! For The wayfarer lying And hungered for rice! The second day, the Prince sent a messenger to the starving man, but he was already dead. Hereupon, Sh≈çtoku was greatly grieved and ordered his burial. Sh≈çtoku later thought the man was no ordinary man for sure, and sending another messenger, discovered the earth had not been disturbed. On opening the tomb there was no body inside, and the Prince's purple garment lay folded on the coffin. The Prince then sent another messenger to claim the garment, and he continued to wear it just as before. Struck by awe, the people praised the Prince: \\"How true it is that a sage knoweth a sage.\\" This legend is linked with the temple of Daruma-dera in ≈åji, Nara, where a stone stupa was found underground, which is exceedingly rare. Prince Sh≈çtoku commissioned the Shitenn≈ç-ji (temple) in Settsu Province (present-day Osaka) after his military victory against the powerful Mononobe clan, for he is said to have summoned them to crush his enemies. Sh≈çtoku's name has been linked with H≈çry≈´-ji, a temple in Yamato Province, and numerous other temples in the Kansai region. Documentation at H≈çry≈´-ji claims that Suiko and Sh≈çtoku founded the temple in the year 607. Archaeological excavations in 1939 have confirmed that Prince Sh≈çtoku's palace, the Ikaruga no miya (ÊñëÈ≥©ÂÆÆ), stood in the eastern part of the current temple complex, where the T≈ç-in (Êù±Èô¢) sits today. Despite being credited as the founder of Japanese Buddhism, it is also said that the Prince respected Shinto and never visited Buddhist temples without visiting Shinto shrines.Sh≈çichi Watanabe (Professor Emeritus at Sophia University) (2014), ÊïôËÇ≤ÊèêË®ÄÔºöÁßÅ„Åå‰ºù„Åà„Åü„ÅÑÂ§©Áöá„ÉªÁöáÂÆ§„ÅÆ„Åì„Å®[My opinion concerning education: What I must hand down regarding the Emperor and the Imperial Family of Japan]. In Seiron, 508, 204-211. In his correspondence with Emperor Yang of Sui, the Prince's letter contains the earliest known written instance in which the Japanese archipelago is referred to by a term meaning \\"land of the rising sun.\\" The Sui Emperor had dispatched a message in 605 that said, \\"the sovereign of Sui respectfully inquires about the sovereign of Wa,\\" and Sh≈çtoku responded by sponsoring a mission led by Ono no Imoko in 607, who brought along a note reading: \\"From the sovereign of the land of the rising sun (hi izuru tokoro) to the sovereign of the land of the setting sun.\\"Varley, Paul.

Titles and name Sh≈çtoku is known by several titles, although his real name is since he was born in front of a stable. He is also known as or . In the Kojiki, his name appears as . In the Nihon Shoki, in addition to Umayado no ≈çji, he is referred to as Toyomimito Sh≈çtoku (Ë±äËÄ≥ËÅ°ËÅñÂæ≥), Toyotomimi no Nori no ≈åkami (Ë±äËÅ°ËÄ≥Ê≥ïÂ§ßÁéã), and simply Nori no Ushi no ≈åkami (Ê≥ï‰∏ªÁéã). The name by which he is best known today, Prince Sh≈çtoku, first appeared in Kaif≈´s≈ç, written more than 100 years after his death in 622 AD. Legacy A number of institutes are named after him, such as Shotoku Gakuen University and its associated junior college (both in Gifu). The first syllable of his name (ËÅñ), can be read sh≈ç in Go-on and can also be read sei in Kan-on. The later reading is found in Seitoku University and its associated junior college (both in Matsudo, Chiba) as well as Tokyo's defunct Seitoku Junior College of Nutrition (and indirectly its replacement Seiei College). In currency 10,000 yen banknote featuring Prince Sh≈çtoku The portrait of Prince Sh≈çtoku has appeared before on 100, 1,000, 5,000 and 10,000 yen bills. Two bills made with different types of materials and special inks with a face value of 100,000,000 (One hundred million yen) were also issued. The characteristic of these bills is that they have a border around it to prevent its alteration. As characteristics, it has a seal and figures in different positions starting from the middle outwards. The measurements of these 2 issues of bills are 35.3 cm x 16 cm and the other with a small variation of 34.3 by 16.5 cm. These cloth tickets were used for the exchange of important values at that time.

Previously, she was a U.S. Assistant Secretary of Education. In 2010, she became \\"an activist on behalf of public schools\\". Her blog at DianeRavitch.net has received more than 36 million page views since she began blogging in 2012. Ravitch writes for the New York Review of Books. Early life and education Ravitch was born into a Jewish family in 1938 in Houston, Texas, where she went to public schools from kindergarten through high school graduation. She is one of eight children. She is a graduate of Wellesley College and earned a Ph.D. from Columbia University. Career Ravitch began her career as an editorial assistant at the New Leader magazine, a socialist journal founded and supported by Eugene V. Debs and Norman Thomas. In 1975, she became a historian of education with a Ph.D. from Columbia University. At that time she worked closely with Teachers College president Lawrence A. Cremin, who was her mentor. Ravitch was appointed to public office by Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton. She served as Assistant Secretary of Education under Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander from 1991 to 1993 and his successor Richard Riley appointed her to serve as a member of the National Assessment Governing Board, which supervises the National Assessment of Educational Progress; she was a member of NAGB from 1997 to 2004. From 1995 to 2005 she held the Brown Chair in Education Studies at the Brookings Institution From 1994 to 2020, Ravitch was Research Professor of Education at New York University‚Äôs Steinhardt School of Culture, Human Development, and Education. Ravitch participated in a \\"blog debate\\" called \\"Bridging Differences\\" with Steinhardt School colleague Deborah Meier on the website of Education Week from February 26, 2007 until September 2012. In April 2012, Ravitch launched an education policy blog, posting up to ten times daily. Her blog is one of the leading education forums in the world, having received more than 36 million page views. She supports the importance of professional teachers and democratic public schools, and she criticizes high-stakes standardized tests and privatization of public schools by privately-managed charters and vouchers for private schools. In 2013, Ravitch joined forces with writer and former teacher, Anthony Cody, to create the The Network for Public Education which is a foundation dedicated to fighting against educational corporate reforms. Since President Trump appointed Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education, membership in NPE has increased from 22,000 to 330,000. Educational views Ravitch's first book The Great School Wars (1974) is a history of New York City public schools. It described alternating eras of centralization and decentralization. It also tied periodic controversies over public education to periodic waves of immigration. Her book The Language Police (2003) was a criticism of both left-wing and right-wing attempts to stifle the study and expression of views deemed unworthy by those groups. The Amazon.com review summarizes Ravitch's thesis as \\"pressure groups from the political right and left have wrested control of the language and content of textbooks and standardized exams, often at the expense of the truth (in the case of history), of literary quality (in the case of literature), and of education in general.\\" Publishers Weekly wrote: \\"Ravitch contends that these sanitized materials sacrifice literary quality and historical accuracy in order to escape controversy.\\"?? Ravitch's writings on racial and cultural diversity were summarized by sociologist Vincent N. Parrillo: = Reading instruction = Ravitch said that she \\"supports the teaching of phonics when appropriate\\". She was critical of the then New York mayor Michael Bloomberg who, after taking control over New York public schools, replaced phonics with balanced literacy helped by Joel Klein, the then chancellor of the New York City Department of Education. Klein credited balanced literacy with raising the city‚Äôs fourth-grade reading scores. Ravitch rebutted that claim by noting that the rise in reading scores occurred in 2002‚Äîbefore Klein became chancellor and implemented balanced literacy. At the same time Ravitch said that she could not bring herself to believe in \\"the science of reading\\". According to her, \\"there is no 'science of mathematics,' no 'science of science,' no 'science of history'\\". =School choice and testing= Being initially a proponent of No Child Left Behind, by 2010 Ravitch renounced her earlier support for high- stakes testing and school choice. She critiqued the punitive uses of accountability to fire teachers and close schools, as well as replacing public schools with charter schools and relying on superstar teachers. She wrote, \\"I no longer believe that either approach will produce the quantum improvement in American education that we all hope for.\\" On her blog, she often cited low- performing charters, frauds, corruption, incompetent charter operators, exclusionary policies practiced by charters, and other poor results that diverted funding from public schools into private hands. High-stakes testing, \\"utopian\\" goals, \\"draconian\\" penalties, school closings, privatization, and charter schools didn't work, she concluded. \\"The best predictor of low academic performance is poverty‚Äînot bad teachers.\\" Ravitch said that the charter school and testing reform movement was started by billionaires and \\"right wing think tanks like the Heritage Foundation,\\" for the purpose of destroying public education and teachers' unions.WNYC, The Leonard Lopate Show, State of Education, interview with Diane Ravitch, May 25, 2010 She reviewed the documentary Waiting for Superman, directed by Davis Guggenheim, as \\"propagandistic\\" (pro-charter schools and anti-public schools), studded with \\"myths\\" and at least one \\"flatly wrong\\" claim.Ravitch, Diane, \\"The Myth of Charter Schools\\", The New York Review of Books, November 11, 2010. Retrieved 2011-04-28. Of Education Secretary Arne Duncan's Race to the Top program, Ravitch said in a 2011 interview it \\"is an extension of No Child Left Behind ...[,] all bad ideas.\\" She concluded \\"We are destroying our education system, blowing it up by these stupid policies. And handing the schools in low-income neighborhoods over to private entrepreneurs does not, in itself, improve them. There's plenty of evidence by now that the kids in those schools do no better, and it's simply a way of avoiding their - the public responsibility to provide good education.\\"Interview with Terry Gross, Fresh Air, NPR, April 28, 2011. Retrieved 2011-04-28. Repudiating the policies she had formerly espoused, Ravitch wrote The Death and Life of the Great American School System: How Testing and Choice Undermine Education (2010), which became a surprise best seller. One reviewer noted that \\"Ravitch exhibits an interesting mix of support for public education and the rights of teachers to bargain collectively with a tough-mindedness that some on the pedagogical left lack.\\" Her next book Reign of Error: The Hoax of the Privatization Movement and Its Danger to America‚Äôs Public Schools was a national bestseller. She describes in detail the policies that are needed to improve the lives of children and families, based on research, and beginning with prenatal care for all pregnant women. Data show that the U.S. lags other nations in providing prenatal care and high-quality preschool, but leads other advanced nations in rates of child poverty and inequality of wealth and income. =National standards and Common Core= During the 1980s, Ravitch began calling for voluntary national standards in education. She became associated with Core Knowledge movement, championed by E. D. Hirsch. During her stint as an assistant secretary of education, she was tasked to develop national standards, despite that the federal government could not require the states to adopt them. By 2007, Ravitch began changing her mind about the free-market components of education reform, but together with Hirsch kept demanding more attention to curriculum and instruction. In 2008 she became a co-chair of the board of the newly created Common Core, Inc., which advocated for the humanities in the curriculum. The group had no connection to the Gates‚Äô-funded Common Core State Standards. In her book The Death and Life of the Great American School System: How Testing and Choice Undermine Education, published in 2010, Ravitch proclaimed: > Every school should have a well-conceived, coherent curriculum. A curriculum > is not a script, but a set of general guidelines. Students should regularly > enage in the study and practice of the liberal arts and sciences: history, > literature, geography, the sciences, civics, mathematics, the arts, and > foreign languages, as we as health and physical education. She continued: > Nations such as Japan and Finland have developed excellent curricula that > spell out what students are supposed to learn in a wide variety of subjects. > If we are willing to learn from top-performing nations, we should establish > a substantive national curriculum that declares our intention to educate all > children in the full range of liberal arts and sciences, as well as physical > education. The curriculum would designate the essential knowledge and skills > that students need to learn. In September 2010, Ravitch left Common Core, Inc., becoming disillusioned by the Gates‚Äô-funded Common Core. The 3rd edition of the book, published in 2016, changed the tone accordingly: > In the original edition of this book, I expressed my view that the nation > needs national standards. I thought that the culture wars of the 1990s are > behind us. I believed that common sense would prevail and that professionals > in every field could agree on the knowledge and skills that all citizens > needed. I did not make any recommendations about national tests. The > fundamental error of the Common Core standards is that they were written by > a small group of people without the involvement of classroom teachers and > scholars in the respective fields. They were written with remarkable speed > but without any public review process. There were no means by which to > revise them after they were published. States could add up to 15 percent > additional content, but could subtract or change nothing. It was a missed > opportunity to do it right. The toxicity of the Common Core standards > persuaded me that it is fruitless to rely on national curriculum standards > as a solution to education problems. Ravitch turned her attention to poverty and racial segregation as the main causes of low student achievement. Ravitch claims that the Common Core \\"was a rush job, and the final product ignored the needs of children with disabilities, English-language learners and those in the early grades\\". She says that the country needs \\"schools where all children have the same chance to learn. That doesn‚Äôt require national standards or national tests, which improve neither teaching nor learning, and do nothing to help poor children at racially segregated schools\\". Personal life She married Richard Ravitch (who later served as Lieutenant Governor of New York) in 1960 and they divorced in 1986. They have two sons; a third son died of leukemia at the age of 2. Ravitch lives in Southold, New York. Her longtime companion is Mary Butz, a retired New York City public school principal who also administered a progressive principal-training program. She and Butz were married on December 12, 2012.

In the traditional version of the game, one person says \\"I packed my bag and in it I put...\\", and names any object. The next person then says \\"I packed my bag and in it I put...\\", followed by the original suggestion, and adding their own. The game continues with more objects being added, and a player is disqualified if they forget one of the previously occurring items or can not think of a new item to add to the bag. The game continues until all but the winner has been disqualified. A typical list after five turns might be something like: \\"I packed my bag and in it I put a book, a toothbrush, a towel, my pet mouse Herman and a bar of chocolate.\\" Variants A common variation of the game is that the items listed must be in alphabetical order, so the first person would need to choose an object beginning with A, the second person's object would begin with B, and so on. Alternatively, objects can be named in any alphabetical order, but without repeating an earlier starting letter. Other variations involve using a scenario other than packing the bag. For example, \\"I went to the zoo and saw...\\" following the same rules as either of the above variants.

Until the early 1970s, the title prime minister of British Columbia was often used. The word premier is derived from the French word of the same spelling, meaning \\"first\\"; and ultimately from the Latin word primarius, meaning \\"primary\\".Onions, C.T. Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology. 1985. Legal status Although the premier is the day-to-day leader of the provincial government, they receive the authority to govern from the Crown (represented in British Columbia by the province's lieutenant governor). Formally, the executive branch of government in British Columbia is said to be vested in the lieutenant governor acting by and with the advice and consent of the executive council. The position of premier is not described in Canadian constitutional statutes. By convention, the leader of the political party that has the support of a majority of members of the Legislative Assembly is usually invited by the lieutenant governor to form the government. Formal responsibilities The responsibilities of the premier usually include: * recommending the appointment and dismissal of ministers to the Lieutenant Governor * serving as the president of the Executive Council and head of the provincial Cabinet. * leading the development and implementation of government policies and priorities * serving as the senior communicator of government priorities and plans between: ** the Lieutenant Governor and Cabinet ** the British Columbia government and other provincial and territorial governments ** the British Columbia Government and the federal government and international governments President of the Executive Council Generally, the premier selects MLAs from their party to be appointed ministers of the Crown by the Lieutenant Governor. Cabinet appointees are designated ministers in charge of government ministries; they are responsible for the day-to-day activities of individual government ministries such as the Ministry of Forests, and for proposing new laws or changing existing ones. The premier may also choose an individual who is not an MLA to be a cabinet minister, although on the rare occasion that this does happen, the practice is that the minister proceeds to obtain a seat in the House. The appointment of an MLA to Cabinet is based on their ability and expertise and is also influenced by political considerations such as geography, gender and ethnicity. A minister remains in office solely at the pleasure of the premier. The resignation of the premier also triggers the resignation of the other members of Cabinet.Much of the information above is adapted from the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia website article \\"Discover more about the role of an MLA\\".

He started his career as an official under the warlord Sun Quan in the 200s during the late Eastern Han dynasty and steadily rising through the ranks. In 219, he assisted Sun Quan's general L√º Meng in an invasion of Jing Province, which led to the defeat and death of Liu Bei's general Guan Yu. In 222, he served as the field commander of the Wu army in the Battle of Xiaoting against Liu Bei's forces and scored a decisive victory over the enemy. Lu Xun reached the pinnacle of his career after this battle as Sun Quan regarded him more highly, promoted him to higher positions and bestowed upon him unprecedented honours. Throughout the middle and the later parts of his career, Lu Xun oversaw and managed both civil and military affairs in Wu while participating in some battles against Wu's rival state, Wei, from time to time. In his final years, Lu Xun was drawn into a succession struggle between Sun Quan's sons and fell out of Sun Quan's favour as a consequence. He managed to retain his appointment as Imperial Chancellor ‚Äì an office he assumed in 244 ‚Äì but died a year later in frustration. Lu Xun's role in the Wu government was likened to that of a custos morum as he believed firmly in and upheld Confucian principles and practices. On the one hand, he provided constant and timely advice to Sun Quan to exercise benevolence and consider the welfare of the people. On the other hand, he vehemently objected to Sun Quan's idea of replacing his legitimate heir apparent in favour of a younger son. Family background Lu Xun's original given name was \\"Yi\\" (), hence he was sometimes referred to as \\"Lu Yi\\" in older historical records. He was born in a family of high social status in Wu County, Wu Commandery, which is present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu. His grandfather Lu Yu () and father Lu Jun () served as officials in the government of the Eastern Han dynasty.(Èô∏Ê∞è‰∏ñÈ†åÊõ∞ÔºöÈÅúÁ•ñÁ¥ÜÔºåÂ≠óÂèîÁõ§ÔºåÊïèÊ∑ëÊúâÊÄùÂ≠∏ÔºåÂÆàÂüéÈñÄÊ†°Â∞â„ÄÇÁà∂ÈßøÔºåÂ≠óÂ≠£ÊâçÔºåÊ∑≥Êáø‰ø°ÂéöÔºåÁÇ∫ÈÇ¶ÊóèÊâÄÊá∑ÔºåÂÆòËá≥‰πùÊ±üÈÉΩÂ∞â„ÄÇ) Lu Shi Shisong annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 58. The Lu clan, which he was from, was one of the four most influential clans in Wu Commandery and also in the Jiangdong region at the time. As he was orphaned at a young age, Lu Xun was raised by his granduncle, Lu Kang, who served as the Administrator () of Lujiang Commandery () under the Han government. Lu Kang was originally on friendly terms with the warlord Yuan Shu, but relations between them soured after Lu Kang broke ties with Yuan Shu when the latter declared himself emperor ‚Äì an act deemed treasonous against the Han emperor. When Lu Kang heard that Yuan Shu was planning to attack Lujiang Commandery, he immediately sent Lu Xun and his relatives back to Wu Commandery for their safety. After Lu Kang died from illness during the siege of Lujiang, Lu Xun became the new head of the Lu family because he was older than Lu Ji (Lu Kang's son) in terms of age,(Èô∏ÈÅúÂ≠ó‰ºØË®ÄÔºåÂê≥ÈÉ°Âê≥‰∫∫‰πü„ÄÇÊú¨ÂêçË≠∞Ôºå‰∏ñÊ±üÊù±Â§ßÊóè„ÄÇ ...

Early career =As a county-level official= In the early 200s, when Lu Xun was 20 years old, he came to serve the warlord Sun Quan, who was nominally a subject of the Han emperor, but had full autonomy in governing the territories in Jiangdong he inherited from his elder brother, Sun Ce. Lu Xun started his career as a minor officer in Sun Quan's office. He later became a Foreman Clerk in the East and West Bureaus () and the Tuntian Commandant of Haichang (Êµ∑ÊòåÂ±ØÁî∞ÈÉΩÂ∞â; jurisdiction in present-day Haining, Zhejiang), before he was appointed as a county-level official. When the county was plagued by consecutive years of drought, Lu Xun opened up the granaries and distributed food supplies to the people, and promoted agriculture. The people benefited from his policies. At the time, there were many households in Wu, Kuaiji, and Danyang () commanderies who were hiding from the government because they wanted to evade taxes and conscription. Lu Xun had them tracked down, registered and resettled. Some able-bodied young men were drafted for military service while others were recruited for agricultural labour.(Â≠´Ê¨äÁÇ∫Â∞áËªçÔºåÈÅúÂπ¥‰∫åÂçÅ‰∏ÄÔºåÂßã‰ªïÂπïÂ∫úÔºåÊ≠∑Êù±Ë•øÊõπ‰ª§Âè≤ÔºåÂá∫ÁÇ∫Êµ∑ÊòåÂ±ØÁî∞ÈÉΩÂ∞âÔºåÂπ∂È†òÁ∏£‰∫ã„ÄÇ ...

He organised a militia to attack the bandits led by Pan Lin () in Kuaiji Commandery, passing through treacherous territory and pacifying those who stood in his way. The number of troops under his command increased to over 2,000. When another bandit chief, You Tu (), caused trouble in Poyang County, Lu Xun led an army to attack the bandits and achieved success. He was commissioned as Colonel Who Establishes Might () and ordered to garrison at Lipu County.(ÊúÉÁ®ΩÂ±±Ë≥äÂ§ßÂ∏•ÊΩòËá®ÔºåËàäÁÇ∫ÊâÄÂú®ÊØíÂÆ≥ÔºåÊ≠∑Âπ¥‰∏çÁ¶Ω„ÄÇÈÅú‰ª•Êâã‰∏ãÂè¨ÂÖµÔºåË®éÊ≤ªÊ∑±Èö™ÔºåÊâÄÂêëÁöÜÊúçÔºåÈÉ®Êõ≤Â∑≤Êúâ‰∫åÂçÉÈ§ò‰∫∫„ÄÇÈÑ±ÈôΩË≥äÂ∏•Â∞§Á™Å‰Ωú‰∫ÇÔºåÂæ©ÂæÄË®é‰πãÔºåÊãúÂÆöÂ®ÅÊ†°Â∞âÔºåËªçÂ±ØÂà©Êµ¶„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 58. Lu Xun once advised Sun Quan to eliminate local bandit forces in Jiangdong first because they would hinder him in his aims to achieve supremacy over China. Sun Quan heeded Lu Xun's words and appointed him as a Commandant of the Right Section () under him. Fei Zhan (), a bandit chief in Danyang Commandery, had received an official appointment from Cao Cao, a leading warlord who was also the de facto head of the Han government. Cao Cao had secretly instructed Fei Zhan to instigate the Shanyue tribes in Jiangdong to cause trouble for Sun Quan. In response, Sun Quan sent Lu Xun to attack Fei Zhan. Lu Xun had a much smaller army as compared to Fei Zhan, but he deceived the enemy into thinking that he had more troops. He prepared more flags and banners, spread out his war drums, ordered his men to sneak into the valleys at night and beat the drums loudly, so as to create an illusion of an overwhelming army. He emerged victorious over Fei Zhan.(...

When Lu Xun travelled to Wu Commandery to meet Sun Quan and explain himself, he praised Chunyu Shi for being an excellent civil official. Sun Quan was puzzled so he asked Lu Xun, \\"Chunyu Shi made accusations against you, yet you praise him. Why?\\" Lu Xun replied, \\"Chunyu Shi was concerned about the people's welfare when he made accusations against me. If I rebuked him, I'll be violating my principles.

Invasion of Jing Province =Planning for the invasion= Around 215, about six years after the Battle of Red Cliffs, Sun Quan had territorial disputes with his ally, Liu Bei, over southern Jing Province. Tensions between them nearly escalated to the point of armed conflict. However, after tense negotiations between Lu Su (Sun Quan's representative) and Guan Yu (Liu Bei's representative), both sides eventually agreed to divide southern Jing Province between their respective domains along the Xiang River.(ÂÇôÈÅÇÂâ≤ÊπòÊ∞¥ÁÇ∫ÁïåÔºåÊñºÊòØÁΩ∑Ëªç„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54.

In 219, L√º Meng came up with a plan to help Sun Quan seize control of Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province. He pretended to be sick and asked for permission to return to Jianye to seek medical treatment. Sun Quan played along by pretending to approve his request. Lu Xun went to visit L√º Meng and said, \\"Guan Yu is near the border. How can we remain far behind the border and not worry about having to guard against him?\\" L√º Meng replied, \\"What you've said is true, but I'm seriously ill now.\\" Lu Xun then said, \\"Guan Yu is proud of his own valour and he scorns others. He may have made great achievements, but he's overly conceited. Besides, he's heading north and he has never seen us a threat. When he knows you're sick, he'll definitely lower his defences. If we attack him when he lowers his guard, we can capture him. I came here to discuss with you a plan to attack him.\\" L√º Meng replied, \\"Guan Yu is known for his bravery and ferocity in battle, and he's a formidable foe.

He has the ability to shoulder this important responsibility. Based on my observations of him, I believe he's capable of taking up greater responsibilities in the future. Besides, he's relatively unknown, so Guan Yu won't be wary of him. This can't be better. If he's appointed, our enemies will be unaware of our intentions, while we can assess our strengths better and seek an opportunity to launch the attack.\\" Sun Quan followed L√º Meng's suggestion and commissioned Lu Xun as a Lieutenant-General () and Inspector of the Right Section () to replace L√º Meng in Jing Province.(ËíôËá≥ÈÉΩÔºåÊ¨äÂïèÔºö„ÄåË™∞ÂèØ‰ª£ÂçøËÄÖÔºü„ÄçËíôÂ∞çÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÈô∏ÈÅúÊÑèÊÄùÊ∑±Èï∑ÔºåÊâçÂ†™Ë≤†ÈáçÔºåËßÄÂÖ∂Ë¶èÊÖÆÔºåÁµÇÂèØÂ§ß‰ªª„ÄÇËÄåÊú™ÊúâÈÅ†ÂêçÔºåÈùûÁæΩÊâÄÂøåÔºåÁÑ°Âæ©ÊòØÈÅé„ÄÇËã•Áî®‰πãÔºåÁï∂‰ª§Â§ñËá™ÈüúÈö±ÔºåÂÖßÂØüÂΩ¢‰æøÔºåÁÑ∂ÂæåÂèØÂÖã„ÄÇ„ÄçÊ¨ä‰πÉÂè¨ÈÅúÔºåÊãúÂÅèÂ∞áËªçÂè≥ÈÉ®Áù£‰ª£Ëíô„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 58. When Lu Xun arrived at Lukou (Èô∏Âè£; at Lushui Lake near present-day Chibi, Hubei) to assume his new office, he wrote to Guan Yu to flatter him: Later, after Guan Yu defeated Yu Jin at the Battle of Fancheng, Lu Xun wrote a letter to Guan again to flatter him and put him off guard: =Invasion and pacification of Jing Province= Upon receiving the letters, Guan Yu saw that Lu Xun showed humility and expressed his desire to rely on him, so he felt at ease and lowered his guard. When Lu Xun heard about it, he wrote a report to Sun Quan and provided crucial details on how to defeat Guan Yu. Sun Quan secretly sent an army to invade Jing Province, with L√º Meng and Lu Xun leading the vanguard force. L√º Meng employed infiltration tactics to disable the watchtowers set up by Guan Yu along the Yangtze River, rendering them unable to warn Guan Yu about Sun Quan's advances, and then swiftly conquered Guan Yu's key bases in Jing Province ‚Äì Gong'an County and Nan Commandery (ÂçóÈÉ°; around present-day Jiangling County, Hubei). For his contributions to the successful conquest of Jing Province, Lu Xun was appointed as the Administrator () of Yidu Commandery (ÂÆúÈÉΩÈÉ°; around present-day Yidu, Hubei), promoted to General Who Pacifies the Border (), and enfeoffed as the Marquis of Hua Village (). Fan You (), the previous Administrator of Yidu Commandery under Guan Yu, abandoned his post and fled, while the officials and tribal chiefs in the commandery surrendered to Lu Xun. Lu Xun ordered official seals to be carved from gold, silver or bronze, and presented to these officials and tribal chiefs.

Even after Sun Quan's forces successfully conquered southern Jing Province, there were still some areas which were still controlled by Liu Bei's forces or other hostile forces, so Lu Xun had to pacify those regions. He sent his subordinates Li Yi (), Xie Jing () and others to lead 3,000 troops to attack Liu Bei's officers Zhan Yan () and Chen Feng (). Li Yi led the naval forces while Xie Jing commanded the land army. They sealed the critical routes and defeated Zhan Yan and captured Chen Feng. They then attacked Deng Fu () and Guo Mu (), the Administrators of Fangling Commandery () and Nanxiang County () respectively, and defeated the enemy. Wen Bu () and Deng Kai (), two influential men in Zigui County, rallied thousands of local tribesmen to form an army to attack Lu Xun in the west. In response, Lu Xun sent Xie Jing to attack them. Wen Bu and Deng Kai were defeated and they fled west to the state of Shu Han (founded by Liu Bei in 221).

Earlier on, when the Shu army first arrived at Yiling, the Wu generals wanted to attack the enemy, but Lu Xun objected and said, \\"Liu Bei is leading an army east to attack us and his army's morale is very high. Besides, his forces are based in high and mountainous terrain, so it's difficult for us to attack them. Even if we manage to win, we cannot completely defeat them. If we suffer any setback, our morale will be greatly affected and this isn't a small issue. Now, we should raise our troops' morale and make plans while waiting for changes in the situation. If we're on plains and flat ground, we should be worrying about sustaining heavy losses in skirmishes and charges. However, since the enemy is on mountainous terrain, they can't carry out an all-out assault because they're sandwiched between wood and rocks. We should take advantage of this weakness of theirs.\\" The Wu generals did not understand Lu Xun's reasoning and thought that he feared the enemy so they were very disgruntled with him.(Âê≥Êõ∏Êõ∞ÔºöË´∏Â∞á‰∏¶Ê¨≤ËøéÊìäÂÇôÔºåÈÅú‰ª•ÁÇ∫‰∏çÂèØÔºåÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂÇôËàâËªçÊù±‰∏ãÔºåÈä≥Ê∞£ÂßãÁõõÔºå‰∏î‰πòÈ´òÂÆàÈö™ÔºåÈõ£ÂèØÂçíÊîªÔºåÊîª‰πãÁ∏±‰∏ãÔºåÁå∂Èõ£Áõ°ÂÖãÔºåËã•Êúâ‰∏çÂà©ÔºåÊêçÊàëÂ§ßÂã¢ÔºåÈùûÂ∞èÊïÖ‰πü„ÄÇ‰ªä‰ΩÜ‰∏îÁçéÂé≤Â∞áÂ£´ÔºåÂª£ÊñΩÊñπÁï•Ôºå‰ª•ËßÄÂÖ∂ËÆä„ÄÇËã•Ê≠§ÈñìÊòØÂπ≥ÂéüÊõ†ÈáéÔºåÁï∂ÊÅêÊúâÈ°õÊ≤õ‰∫§È¶≥‰πãÊÜÇÔºå‰ªäÁ∑£Â±±Ë°åËªçÔºåÂã¢‰∏çÂæóÂ±ïÔºåËá™Áï∂ÁΩ∑ÊñºÊú®Áü≥‰πãÈñìÔºåÂæêÂà∂ÂÖ∂ÂºäËÄ≥„ÄÇ„ÄçË´∏Â∞á‰∏çËß£Ôºå‰ª•ÁÇ∫ÈÅúÁïè‰πãÔºåÂêÑÊá∑ÊÜ§ÊÅ®„ÄÇ) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 58.

Lu Xun then targeted one enemy camp and attacked it but failed to capture it. The Wu officers complained, \\"We're sacrificing our soldiers' lives for nothing.\\" Lu Xun replied, \\"I have devised a strategy for defeating the enemy.\\" He then ordered his men to carry a pile of straw each and launch a fire attack on the enemy. Upon the commencement of the fire attack, Lu Xun led all the Wu units on an all-out assault on the Shu forces. The Shu generals Zhang Nan and Feng Xi, and the tribal king Shamoke (Liu Bei's ally) were killed in battle, while the Wu forces destroyed over 40 Shu camps.(‰πÉÂÖàÊîª‰∏ÄÁáüÔºå‰∏çÂà©„ÄÇË´∏Â∞áÁöÜÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÁ©∫ÊÆ∫ÂÖµËÄ≥„ÄÇ„ÄçÈÅúÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂêæÂ∑≤ÊõâÁ†¥‰πã‰πãË°ì„ÄÇ„Äç‰πÉÂãëÂêÑÊåÅ‰∏ÄÊääËåÖÔºå‰ª•ÁÅ´ÊîªÊãî‰πã„ÄÇ‰∏ÄÁàæÂã¢ÊàêÔºåÈÄöÁéáË´∏ËªçÂêåÊôÇ‰ø±ÊîªÔºåÊñ¨ÂºµÂçó„ÄÅÈ¶ÆÁøíÂèäËÉ°ÁéãÊ≤ôÊë©ÊüØÁ≠âÈ¶ñÔºåÁ†¥ÂÖ∂ÂõõÂçÅÈ§òÁáü„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 58. The Shu officers Du Lu (), Liu Ning () and others surrendered when they saw they had no chance of escaping. Liu Bei and his remaining troops retreated to the Ma'an Hills (), where they continued to be fiercely assaulted by Wu forces from all directions. At the same time, landslides occurred at the Ma'an Hills and caused the Shu forces to suffer thousands of casualties. Liu Bei fled at night and ordered his men to pile up their armour and set them on fire to create barriers for the pursuing enemy. By the time Liu Bei reached the safety of Baidicheng, all his boats, military equipment and supplies had been captured by Wu forces. The dead bodies of Shu soldiers floated in the river and obstructed its flow. Liu Bei was extremely upset and furious with his defeat.

When Liu Bei heard of the Wei invasion of Wu, he still had his armies and scouts on and around the border, Zhuge Liang, Li Yan, Liu Yan, Zhao Yun and many other Han officials, even those who agreed with the campaign to reclaim Jing insisted on renewing the alliance of Wu. With both Zhuge Jin and Lu Xun offering peace in letters because of the threat of a Wei invasion with Sun Quan's refusal to send his son as a hostage, Liu finally agreed and wrote to Lu to not only renew the alliance but coordinate an attack against Wei: \\"The enemy (Wei) is at Jiangling now.

Lu Xun replied: Liu Bei died in 223 and was succeeded by his son, Liu Shan, as the emperor of Shu. Zhuge Liang became Shu's head of government and he made peace with Wu and reestablished the Wu‚ÄìShu alliance against Wei. Sun Quan granted permission to Lu Xun to reply to Zhuge Liang on his behalf, and had a duplicate of his own official seal made and sent to Lu's office. Whenever Sun Quan wrote to Liu Shan and Zhuge Liang, he would allow Lu Xun to read the letters, make the appropriate modifications, stamp his official seal on them and have them delivered to Shu.(ÂÇôÂ∞ãÁóÖ‰∫°ÔºåÂ≠êÁ¶™Ë•≤‰ΩçÔºåË´∏Ëëõ‰∫ÆÁßâÊîøÔºåËàáÊ¨äÈÄ£Âíå„ÄÇÊôÇ‰∫ãÊâÄÂÆúÔºåÊ¨äËºí‰ª§ÈÅúË™û‰∫ÆÔºåÂπ∂ÂàªÊ¨äÂç∞Ôºå‰ª•ÁΩÆÈÅúÊâÄ„ÄÇÊ¨äÊØèËàáÁ¶™„ÄÅ‰∫ÆÊõ∏ÔºåÂ∏∏ÈÅéÁ§∫ÈÅúÔºåËºïÈáçÂèØÂê¶ÔºåÊúâÊâÄ‰∏çÂÆâÔºå‰æø‰ª§ÊîπÂÆöÔºå‰ª•Âç∞Â∞ÅË°å‰πã„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 58. Battle of Shiting In 228, Sun Quan instructed Zhou Fang, the Administrator () of Poyang Commandery (), to pretend to defect to Cao Xiu, the Grand Marshal () of Wei, and lure Wei forces to attack Wu. Cao Xiu fell for the ruse and led his armies to attack the Wu garrison at Wan County (ÁöñÁ∏£; present-day Qianshan County, Anhui).

During the Battle of Shiting, Lu Xun remained in the central command, with Zhu Huan and Quan Cong leading the armies on his left and right flanks respectively. Their three armies advanced together and defeated Cao Xiu's forces lying in ambush and drove them further northward until Jiashi (). They killed and captured thousands of enemies and obtained much of the enemy's livestock, equipment and supplies. Cao Xiu died of illness after returning to Wei. Lu Xun and the victorious Wu forces returned to Wuchang (Ê≠¶Êòå; present-day Ezhou, Hubei), where Sun Quan held a grand reception for them. Sun Quan instructed his servants to shield Lu Xun with his imperial parasol when he entered or left the palace, and rewarded Lu Xun with many gifts.

Sun Song (Â≠´Êùæ; Sun Yi's son), the Colonel of Trainee Archers (), who was one of Sun Quan's favourite relatives, allowed his men to fool around in camp and did not maintain good military discipline.

Lu Xun sent a close aide, Han Bian (), to deliver a report to Sun Quan. On the journey back, Han Bian was captured by a Wei patrol. When Zhuge Jin received news of Han Bian's capture, he became fearful so he wrote to Lu Xun: \\"His Majesty has withdrawn his forces. The enemy has captured Han Bian and they know our situation. The rivers have dried up so we should make a hasty retreat.\\" Lu Xun did not respond, and he instructed his men to plant turnips and peas, while he played weiqi and other games with his officers as though nothing had happened. Zhuge Jin said, \\"Boyan possesses intelligence and strategy, he knows what he's doing.\\" He came to see Lu Xun, who told him, \\"The enemy knows that His Majesty has withdrawn his forces, so they have no worries and will concentrate their attacks on us.

Lu Xun then secretly conveyed his plan to Zhuge Jin and ordered him to supervise the fleet of vessels on which they would sail back to Wu, while he gathered his troops and headed towards Xiangyang. The Wei forces had been wary of Lu Xun all this while so they immediately retreated back into the city when they saw Lu Xun's army approaching. Lu Xun organised his men in an orderly manner and instructed them to pretend to prepare for an attack on Xiangyang. By then, Zhuge Jin and the fleet had shown up, so Lu Xun and his forces progressively retreated to the vessels and left. The Wei forces in Xiangyang did not dare to make any move.(‰πÉÂØÜËàáÁëæÁ´ãË®àÔºå‰ª§ÁëæÁù£ËàüËàπÔºåÈÅúÊÇâ‰∏äÂÖµÈ¶¨Ôºå‰ª•ÂêëË•ÑÈôΩÂüé„ÄÇÊïµÁ¥†ÊÜöÈÅúÔºåÈÅΩÈÇÑËµ¥Âüé„ÄÇÁëæ‰æøÂºïËàπÂá∫ÔºåÈÅúÂæêÊï¥ÈÉ®‰ºçÔºåÂºµÊãìËÅ≤Âã¢ÔºåÊ≠•Ë∂®ËàπÔºåÊïµ‰∏çÊï¢Âπ≤„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 58. =Raid in Shiyang= On their journey back to Wu, the fleet passed by Baiwei (), where Lu Xun announced that they would be getting off their vessels to go ashore for a hunting expedition. However, he actually gave secret orders to his subordinates Zhou Jun () and Zhang Liang () to lead their men to attack Xinshi (), Anlu () and Shiyang () counties in Jiangxia Commandery (). Outside Shiyang County, the common people were going about their daily activities in the marketplace when Zhou Jun and his men showed up. The people immediately packed up everything and attempted to rush to safety behind the city walls. The Wei soldiers in Shiyang wanted to close the city gates but the civilians were blocking the way, so they killed some people and forced the gates to be shut. Zhou Jun and his men killed and captured over 1,000 civilians in Shiyang. The captives were resettled in Wu. Lu Xun gave orders to his men, forbidding them from harassing the people. Those captives who had their families with them were given due attention and care while those who lost their loved ones during the raid were provided with food and clothing and treated well before they were sent home. Many people were so touched by Lu Xun's acts of kindness that they decided to move to Wu territory. When news of Lu Xun's kindness spread to the neighbouring regions, two Wei officers, Zhao Zhuo () and Fei Sheng (), and a tribal king, Meiyi (), led their followers to join Lu Xun. Lu Xun generously distributed rewards to them.(ËªçÂà∞ÁôΩÂúçÔºåË®óË®Ä‰ΩèÁçµÔºåÊΩõÈÅ£Â∞áËªçÂë®Â≥ª„ÄÅÂºµÊ¢ÅÁ≠âÊìäÊ±üÂ§èÊñ∞Â∏Ç„ÄÅÂÆâÈô∏„ÄÅÁü≥ÈôΩÔºåÁü≥ÈôΩÂ∏ÇÁõõÔºåÂ≥ªÁ≠âÂ•ÑËá≥Ôºå‰∫∫ÁöÜÊçêÁâ©ÂÖ•Âüé„ÄÇÂüéÈñÄÂôé‰∏çÂæóÈóúÔºåÊïµ‰πÉËá™Êñ´ÊÆ∫Â∑±Ê∞ëÔºåÁÑ∂ÂæåÂæóÈóî„ÄÇÊñ¨È¶ñÁç≤ÁîüÔºåÂá°ÂçÉÈ§ò‰∫∫„ÄÇ ...

When Lu Xun heard that Lu Shi could not get along with Wen Xiu (), a son of the veteran Wei general Wen Ping, he came up with a plan to stop Lu Shi. He pretended to have received a letter from Lu Shi and wrote a \\"reply\\" as such: \\"I can sense your sincerity and sorrow when you told me you have disagreements with Wen Xiu. You said both of you cannot exist together and you intend to defect to my side. I have delivered your letter to my lord and will gather my men to welcome you. You should make preparations soon and inform us of the date of your defection.\\" He then left the \\"reply\\" letter at the border, where it was picked up by Lu Shi's men. When Lu Shi heard about it, he became afraid and immediately sent his family to the Wei capital Luoyang.

Criticism Commenting on this incident, the historian Pei Songzhi wrote: =Suppressing rebellions in Wu= In 237, Zhou Zhi (), a General of the Household (), wanted to recruit soldiers from Poyang Commandery () so he sought Lu Xun's opinion. Lu Xun believed that the people in Poyang were very restless and should not be recruited for military service because they might rebel. Zhou Zhi ignored Lu Xun's advice and persisted. As Lu Xun predicted, the people in Poyang started a rebellion under the leadership of Wu Ju () and they killed Zhou Zhi and seized control of many counties. The people in the nearby Yuzhang () and Luling () commanderies had a history of being rebellious, so they responded to Wu Ju's call and joined the revolt. Lu Xun led his forces to suppress the rebellion and succeeded in forcing Wu Ju and the rebels to surrender. He recruited over 8,000 men into his army and pacified the three commanderies.(ÂÖ≠Âπ¥Ôºå‰∏≠ÈÉéÂ∞áÂë®Á•ó‰πûÊñºÈÑ±ÈôΩÂè¨ÂãüÔºå‰∫ã‰∏ãÂïèÈÅú„ÄÇÈÅú‰ª•ÁÇ∫Ê≠§ÈÉ°Ê∞ëÊòìÂãïÈõ£ÂÆâÔºå‰∏çÂèØËàáÂè¨ÔºåÊÅêËá¥Ë≥äÂØá„ÄÇËÄåÁ•óÂõ∫Èô≥Âèñ‰πãÔºåÈÉ°Ê∞ëÂê≥ÈÅΩÁ≠âÊûú‰ΩúË≥äÊÆ∫Á•óÔºåÊîªÊ≤íË´∏Á∏£„ÄÇË±´Á´†„ÄÅÂª¨ÈôµÂÆøÊÉ°Ê∞ëÔºå‰∏¶ÊáâÈÅΩÁÇ∫ÂØá„ÄÇÈÅúËá™ËÅûÔºåËºíË®éÂç≥Á†¥ÔºåÈÅΩÁ≠âÁõ∏ÁéáÈôçÔºåÈÅúÊñôÂæóÁ≤æÂÖµÂÖ´ÂçÉÈ§ò‰∫∫Ôºå‰∏âÈÉ°Âπ≥„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 58. =Incident of L√º Yi= At the time, L√º Yi, the supervisor of the audit bureau, was abusing his powers.

Role in the succession struggle There were vacancies in the appointments available in the estates (or offices) of two of Sun Quan's sons: Sun He, the Crown Prince and Sun Ba, the Prince of Lu. Many officials nominated their relatives to fill up these positions in the hope of building connections with the princes. When Quan Cong told Lu Xun about this, Lu Xun said that many of the nominated candidates were actually not up to standard. He argued that those officials were actually promoting nepotism and pursuing their own interests. He also worried that if those officials' relatives turned out to be incompetent, it could lead to serious problems in the administration. Lu Xun also foresaw that conflict was bound to break out between the two princes because they were equally influential and had their own factions supporting them. He believed that a power struggle between the princes would be detrimental to Eastern Wu's prosperity and stability. Quan Cong's son, Quan Ji (), became a close aide to Sun Ba and helped him in his fight against Sun He. Lu Xun wrote to Quan Cong to warn him: \\"If you don't learn from Ma Midi and choose to let (Quan) Ji have his way, you'll bring disaster upon yourself and your family.\\" Quan Cong ignored Lu Xun's advice and their relationship became strained.(ÂÖàÊòØÔºå‰∫åÂÆÆ‰∏¶ÈóïÔºå‰∏≠Â§ñËÅ∑Âè∏Â§öÈÅ£Â≠êÂºüÁµ¶‰æç„ÄÇÂÖ®ÁêÆÂ†±ÈÅúÔºåÈÅú‰ª•ÁÇ∫Â≠êÂºüËãüÊúâÊâçÔºå‰∏çÊÜÇ‰∏çÁî®Ôºå‰∏çÂÆúÁßÅÂá∫‰ª•Ë¶ÅÊ¶ÆÂà©ÔºõËã•ÂÖ∂‰∏ç‰Ω≥ÔºåÁµÇÁÇ∫ÂèñÁ¶ç„ÄÇ‰∏îËÅû‰∫åÂÆÆÂã¢ÊïµÔºåÂøÖÊúâÂΩºÊ≠§ÔºåÊ≠§Âè§‰∫∫‰πãÂéöÂøå‰πü„ÄÇÁêÆÂ≠êÂØÑÔºåÊûúÈòøÈôÑÈ≠ØÁéãÔºåËºïÁÇ∫‰∫§Êßã„ÄÇÈÅúÊõ∏ËàáÁêÆÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂçø‰∏çÂ∏´Êó•Á£æÔºåËÄåÂÆøÁïôÈòøÂØÑÔºåÁµÇÁÇ∫Ë∂≥‰∏ãÈñÄÊà∂Ëá¥Á¶çÁü£„ÄÇ„ÄçÁêÆÊó£‰∏çÁ¥çÔºåÊõ¥‰ª•Ëá¥Èöô„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 58. When there were rumours that Sun He could no longer secure his position as Crown Prince, Lu Xun wrote a memorial to Sun Quan: \\"The Crown Prince is the legitimate heir apparent so he should have a foundation as solid as hard rock. The Prince of Lu is a vassal and a subject of the state, so he should receive less favours than the Crown Prince. If both of them know their places, Your Majesty and all your subjects will have peace. I humbly kowtow and beg Your Majesty, to the point of bleeding (from my forehead), to (re)consider this issue carefully.\\" He wrote several memorials to Sun Quan and even requested to leave Wuchang (Ê≠¶Êòå; present-day Ezhou, Hubei) and go to the capital to speak up on this problem. Sun Quan denied him permission. Lu Xun's maternal nephews Gu Tan, Gu Cheng () and Yao Xin (), who supported Sun He during the succession struggle, were sent into exile. Wu Can, the Crown Prince's Tutor (), who had been exchanging letters with Lu Xun, was imprisoned and later executed.(ÂèäÂ§™Â≠êÊúâ‰∏çÂÆâ‰πãË≠∞ÔºåÈÅú‰∏äÁñèÈô≥Ôºö„ÄåÂ§™Â≠êÊ≠£Áµ±ÔºåÂÆúÊúâÁõ§Áü≥‰πãÂõ∫ÔºåÈ≠ØÁéãËó©Ëá£ÔºåÁï∂‰ΩøÂØµÁß©ÊúâÂ∑ÆÔºåÂΩºÊ≠§ÂæóÊâÄÔºå‰∏ä‰∏ãÁç≤ÂÆâ„ÄÇË¨πÂè©È†≠ÊµÅË°Ä‰ª•ËÅû„ÄÇ„ÄçÊõ∏‰∏âÂõõ‰∏äÔºåÂèäÊ±ÇË©£ÈÉΩÔºåÊ¨≤Âè£Ë´ñÈÅ©Â∫∂‰πãÂàÜÔºå‰ª•Âå°ÂæóÂ§±„ÄÇÊó£‰∏çËÅΩË®±ÔºåËÄåÈÅúÂ§ñÁîüÈ°ßË≠ö„ÄÅÈ°ßÊâø„ÄÅÂßö‰ø°Ôºå‰∏¶‰ª•Ë¶™ÈôÑÂ§™Â≠êÔºåÊûâË¶ãÊµÅÂæô„ÄÇÂ§™Â≠êÂ§™ÂÇÖÂêæÁ≤≤ÂùêÊï∏ËàáÈÅú‰∫§Êõ∏Ôºå‰∏ãÁçÑÊ≠ª„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 58. =Death and aftermath= Sun Quan repeatedly sent emissaries to Wuchang (Ê≠¶Êòå; present-day Ezhou, Hubei) to reprimand Lu Xun for interfering with the succession. Lu Xun died sometime between 16 March and 13 April 245 in anger and frustration at the age of 63 (by East Asian age reckoning). Lu Xun was a thrifty man. When he died, he left behind little or no wealth for his family. Sometime between 258 and 264, Sun Xiu, the third Wu emperor, awarded Lu Xun the posthumous title \\"Marquis Zhao\\" (Êò≠‰æØ; literally \\"illustrious marquis\\").(Ê¨äÁ¥ØÈÅ£‰∏≠‰ΩøË≤¨ËÆìÈÅúÔºåÈÅúÊÜ§ÊÅöËá¥ÂçíÔºåÊôÇÂπ¥ÂÖ≠ÂçÅ‰∏âÔºåÂÆ∂ÁÑ°È§òË≤°„ÄÇ ...

Appraisal When Ji Yan proposed introducing drastic reforms in the Wu administration (which included the dismissal of many officials he deemed incompetent), Lu Xun cautioned Sun Quan against that and accurately predicted that it would lead to problems. Lu Xun once told Zhuge Ke, \\"I respect those who are superior to me in status; I assist those who are subordinate to me. I see you behave arrogantly in front of those superior to you, and you belittle those subordinate to you. This isn't the way to build a stable career.\\" In another incident, Yang Zhu () became famous in his youth, but Lu Xun predicted that he was doomed to failure, so he advised Yang Zhu's elder brother, Yang Mu (), to break ties with Yang Zhu.

The PFWBC is historically and theologically a combination of both, having begun as a small group of churches in North Carolina that broke away from the Free Will Baptist Church to join the Holiness movement and eventually accepting certain Pentecostal doctrines. History Paul Palmer ministered in the Carolinas in the first half of the 18th century. He established a church in 1727 in Chowan, North Carolina. The southern branch of Free Will Baptists are largely the fruit of his labor. Many of these \\"Palmer\\" churches cooperated to form the National Association of Free Will Baptists in 1935. Reverend G. B. Cashwell (1862-1916),Approximately 9,100 words a former minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, returned to North Carolina after experiencing what he felt to be the baptism of the Holy Spirit in 1906 at the Azusa Street Revival. He began preaching \\"pentecost\\" to the Holiness denominations there, one of which was this small group of former Free Will Baptists. Through a series of meetings he held, beginning in 1906, this group accepted points of Pentecostal faith and practice. Cashwell's own group was the Pentecostal Holiness Church (now known as the International Pentecostal Holiness Church). The Pentecostal Free Will Baptist Church was formed from these groups in 1959. Doctrine The doctrine is a mixture of Baptist (specifically, Free Will Baptist) and Pentecostal beliefs. Sanctification as a second work of grace, baptism of the Holy Ghost as evidenced by speaking in tongues, and the supernatural move of the Holy Spirit are important aspects of the Pentecostal Free Will Baptist denomination. A General Meeting is held biannually. Headquarters are in Dunn, North Carolina, where Heritage Bible College was started in 1971. Membership In 1998, the PFWBC had an estimated 28,000 members in 150 churches. In addition to the majority of churches in eastern North Carolina, there are also churches in Virginia, South Carolina and Florida, as well as overseas missions. Though the Pentecostal Free Will Baptist Church recognizes its Baptist heritage, its advance and choice of fellowship has been Pentecostal, shown, for example, by its membership in the Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America (formerly the Pentecostal Fellowship of North America).

She was a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1987 to 2007. She represented the ridings of Sudbury East and Nickel Belt. She was a cabinet minister in the government of Bob Rae. Background Martel was born in Sudbury, Ontario, the second of four children. Her father is Elie Martel, who was a long time NDP member of the Ontario legislature. Her mother is the daughter of another area politician, Norman Fawcett, who served as mayor of Capreol, and as Nickel Belt's federal MP from 1965 to 1968. She studied International Politics at the University of Toronto and French at the Sorbonne. She then worked as a claims adjudicator with the Ontario Workers' Compensation Board. Martel and former Ontario NDP leader Howard Hampton were married in 1994, and have two children, Sarah and Jonathan. Both were members of cabinet in the Bob Rae government at that time. Her daughter, Sarah served as a legislative page in 2007. Martel herself was a page when her father was serving in the Legislature. In 2003, both Martel and Hampton supported Bill Blaikie's campaign to become leader of the federal New Democratic Party. She lives in Toronto, Ontario. Politics In 1987 at age 24, Martel was elected as the New Democratic Party candidate in the riding of Sudbury East defeating Liberal opponent Claude Mayer by 6,005 votes. She was named as the party's critic for culture and francophone affairs. She was re- elected in the 1990 provincial election, in which the NDP won a majority government. =In cabinet= On October 1, 1990, Martel was named Minister of Northern Development and Government House Leader in the cabinet of Bob Rae. On July 31, 1991 Rae performed a minor cabinet shuffle. Martel's portfolio was enhanced when she took over Mines from Gilles Pouliot to become the Minister of Northern Development and Mines but she lost her position as Government House Leader to Dave Cooke. In June 1991, she became involved in a minor controversy when she and fellow cabinet minister Anne Swarbrick wrote letters to the Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons asking for the suspension of the licence of a physician who had been convicted of sexually assaulting four teenage female patients. Since the letters violated conflict of interest guidelines she and Swarbrick offered their resignations from cabinet. However Premier Rae refused to accept their resignations. He said, \\"Not every mistake in these circumstances should lead to a resignation.\\" Liberal leader Robert Nixon, who expressed his view to the Ontario Legislature that, while it may not have been an appropriate action for members of Cabinet, it was not one that should lead to their discharge. He said, \\"Their reputations and integrity have in no way suffered by these statements.\\" In July 1991, Martel led an effort to save a paper mill in Kapuskasing from closure. The deal was initially rejected by cabinet but was resurrected in August when Rae agreed to purchase the Smoky Falls hydroelectric dam from Kimberly-Clark and give the mill 10 years of free power. In December 1991, she was involved in another controversy when she fabricated some remarks about a Sudbury doctor who had criticized the government about billing caps. One of the participants at the meeting was Evelyn Dodds, a Thunder Bay municipal councillor and former Progressive Conservative candidate. Dodds wrote a letter about the conversation to PC leader Mike Harris who read it in the legislature. Martel said of the incident, \\"I made some remarks which were completely unfounded and which are without basis,\\" and that they were made during a \\"heated private conversation.\\" The opposition called for Martel's resignation but this was rejected by Rae. \\"The minister has apologized for what happened in a private conversation and admitted she made a mistake ... and as far as I'm concerned that's (the end of it).\\" In March 1992, an all-party committee investigated the incident. Martel took the unusual step of taking a lie detector test to show that she was telling the truth about making up a story about seeing confidential files on the doctor. The committee concluded that Martel did not need to resign. However, the Liberal and Conservative members of the committee who were in the minority called for Martel's resignation. While Martel was exonerated by the committee's report, the controversy continued to dog her through the next couple of years and her influence in cabinet was limited. She finally resigned from her portfolio on October 7, 1994. Martel's resignation occurred after the Ontario Privacy Commissioner found that she had passed on personal financial information about an Ottawa man who owned land for the purposes of mining speculation. =Cabinet positions= =In opposition= Despite her colourful career in cabinet and the general decline of the NDP, Martel was re-elected in Sudbury East in the 1995 provincial election, defeating Liberal opponent Paul Menard. She was one of only seventeen NDP MPPs to be re-elected in this campaign. She was named as the party's critic for natural resources. In 1996, Martel and fellow MPP Peter Kormos surreptitiously entered a government building for a new department for family support. They wanted to show that the new centralized office was in disarray. They videotaped an office full of empty desks, boxes and unplugged computers. While the two were not charged with trespassing, Kormos was acquitted of a charge of assaulting a security guard during their visit. When the riding of Sudbury East was eliminated for the 1999 election, she was re-elected again in the redistributed Nickel Belt riding. Nickel Belt's previous MPP Blain Morin, who had won the riding just eight months earlier in a by-election following the retirement of Floyd Laughren, decided not to challenge Martel for the party's nomination. She defeated her Liberal opponent by 4,344 votes. In 2000, Martel co-sponsored a private member's bill with fellow NDP member Marilyn Churley that called for a ban on development on the environmentally sensitive Oak Ridges Moraine. While the bill did not pass it helped to heighten awareness of the issue and led to a six-month development moratorium in 2001. Elements of the private member's bill were incorporated into the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, 2002. In 2002, Martel sponsored another private member's bill on the rights of medical patients. The bill which she named the 'Tommy Douglas Act' would have set standards for patient care and ensured accessibility for long term care. In the 2003 election, she defeated Liberal Alex McCauley by fewer than 3,000 votes to win her fifth and final term in the legislature. =Retirement= On May 18, 2007, Martel announced that she would not seek re-election and would quit politics after the 2007 election, to spend more time with her family and pursue other career opportunities. During the election campaign, Progressive Conservative leader John Tory stated that if elected, he would name Martel to conduct a review of current government medical and social services for children with autism, an issue which Martel had frequently championed in the legislature. In response to the statement, Hampton said \\"I wish Mr. Tory good luck, but my wife is rather fussy about who she hangs around with. Believe me, I know. It took me about six years.\\" Martel committed, however, to campaign on behalf of France G√©linas, her successor as the New Democratic Party candidate in Nickel Belt. On election day, G√©linas successfully held the riding, defeating Liberal candidate Ron Dupuis.

The college now also serves Sheldon, and portions of Clear Creek ISD and Humble ISD. San Jacinto College headquarters are located in Pasadena, Texas.Campus Locations . San Jacinto College. Retrieved on November 4, 2009. History In May 1960, voters in the Channelview, Deer Park, Galena Park, La Porte, and Pasadena school districts approved the creation of East Harris County Union Junior College, elected seven members to serve on the Board of Regents and authorized the Board of Regents (now Board of Trustees) to levy a tax for the college operations and maintenance. On February 16, 1961, the Board of Regents changed the name of the district to The San Jacinto Junior College District. Using renovated buildings in Pasadena, the college welcomed 876 students to its first classes in September 1961. The San Jacinto Junior College District was approved and accredited by the Texas Department of Education when the college opened. The college was granted full membership in the Association of Texas Colleges and Universities on April 6, 1963. On November 4, 1968, Sheldon Independent School District was voted part of the college district. On November 30, 1966, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools first granted San Jacinto college accreditation. The north and south campuses were first accredited in 1976 and 1979, respectively. The most recent reaffirmation of accreditation for all three campuses occurred in 2019. Bonds issued in 1972 included funds for the North Campus. Following five terms of extension classes offered at North Shore High School, the North Campus opened for classes on its site in the fall of 1975. In 1976, bonds were approved for a third campus. After several terms of extension classes offered at J. Frank Dobie High School, San Jacinto College South opened for classes in September 1979. In 1997, James F. Horton became the chancellor, and Adena Williams Loston became the second president of San Jacinto College South and the first African- American president in the district. In December 1999 voters approved the issuing of $91 million in general obligation bonds, allowing the construction of six new buildings including the Interactive Learning Centers and Fine Arts Centers. Another vote in May 2008 earmarked $295 million to create updated science facilities, allied health facilities, library improvements, and physical education facility improvements. Clear Horizons Early College High School opened its doors on the south campus in the fall of 2007. A partnership with Clear Creek ISD, this program allows students to earn an associate degree while simultaneously earning a high school diploma. In 2008, Hurricane Ike inflicted significant damage to the three campuses. Students were back in class in less than three weeks.  Campuses  The stairs in the Library in the Central campus The college has three main campuses and six extension centers. The Central campus is in Pasadena, the North and South campuses are in Houston on Uvalde and Beamer Road respectively. There are two extension centers in Webster, one at Clear Lake High School, two in Galena Park and one in Pasadena.  Organization and administration  Established in 1961, the district originally consisted of the areas of Channelview ISD, Deer Park ISD, Galena Park ISD, La Porte ISD, and Pasadena ISD. The district now also serves Sheldon ISD. As defined by the Texas Legislature, the official service area of San Jacinto College includes territory within the following school districts:Texas Education Code, Section 130.197, \\"San Jacinto College District Service Area\\". the Channelview Independent School District, the Deer Park Independent School District, the Galena Park Independent School District, the La Porte Independent School District, the Pasadena Independent School District, the Sheldon Independent School District and the portion of Clear Creek Independent School District located in Harris County. Some facilities are also located within the boundaries of Clear Creek ISD but Clear Creek ISD is not considered In-District for enrollment purposes.  Academics  San Jacinto College offers students an opportunity to complete classes in Basic, Intermediate, and Paramedic level emergency medical technology.

Her employer recognized her writing skills and moved her to the copywriting department, where she advanced rapidly to become one of the nation's highest-paid ad copywriters in the early 1960s. In 1959, she married David Brown, who would go on to become a noted film producer. Career =Publishing= Helen Gurley Brown in 1964 In 1962, Brown's book Sex and the Single GirlScanlon 2009, p. ix. was published in 28 countries, and stayed on the bestseller lists for over a year. In 1964 the book inspired the film of the same name starring Natalie Wood. In 1965, Brown became editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan, then a literary magazine famed for high-toned content, and reinvented it as a magazine for the modern single career-woman. In the 1960s, Brown was an outspoken advocate of women's sexual freedom and sought to provide women with role models in her magazine. She claimed that women could have it all ‚Äì \\"love, sex, and money\\". As a result of her advocacy, glamorous, fashion-focused women were sometimes called \\"Cosmo Girls\\". Her work played a part in what is often called the sexual revolution. In 1997, Brown was ousted from her role as the U.S. editor of CosmopolitanScanlon 2009, p. xiv. and replaced by Bonnie Fuller. When she left, Cosmopolitan ranked sixth at the newsstand and, for the 16th straight year, ranked first in bookstores on college campuses. However, she stayed on at Hearst publishing and remained the international editor for all 59 international editions of Cosmo until her death on August 13, 2012. In September 2008, Brown was named the 13th-most- powerful American over the age of 80 by Slate magazine. =At Cosmopolitan= In 1965, Gurley took over as editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan magazine and was in that position until 1997. Brown revamped the magazine by taking it from a women's magazine written by men to one of the most widely sold women's magazines, now available in more than 100 countries. When she began at the magazine, Brown had no editing experience. Her take on the magazine was to be frank when talking about sex in this new version of Cosmopolitan. Sex and the Single Girl gave Brown the formula that is today's Cosmopolitan. She gave women the freedom to know that women do have sexual desires. The New York Times described the Cosmo Girl that Brown was after as \\"self-made, sexual and supremely ambitious. ... she looked great, wore fabulous clothes and had an unabashedly good time when those clothes came off.\\" After being gently let go, in 1996 at age 74 due to her increasing disconnection from young women,\\"Enter Helen\\", Brooke Hauser pg 379 Helen Gurley Brown went on to be editor of the international Cosmopolitan magazines. Betty Friedan, author of The Feminine Mystique, disliked what Brown had done in her book and in the magazine. Friedan said that what Brown was doing was \\"anti-feminist\\" and an \\"immature teenage-level sexual fantasy\\". Feminist views of the magazine were re- evaluated in the 1990s, however, with New York Times media reporter Randall Rothenberg writing, \\"In retrospect, the magazine played an important role in helping young women redefine their roles in society.\\" Audie Cornish from NPR said that Helen \\"has been called a bad girl, a pioneer in Prada, a revolutionary in stilettos.\\" Brown looked at herself as a feminist, but this description was contested by several others. Personal life and death Helen Gurley and David Brown After a brief hospitalization, Helen Gurley Brown died August 13, 2012 at the McKeen Pavilion at New York‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital/Columbia. She was 90. In a statement announcing the news of her death, Hearst Publications noted that \\"Helen was one of the world's most recognized magazine editors and book authors, and a true pioneer for women in journalism ‚Äì and beyond.\\" The cause of her death was not disclosed. Entertainment Weekly said that \\"Gurley Brown will be remembered for her impact on the publishing industry, her contributions to the culture at large, and sly quips like her famous line: 'Good girls go to heaven. Bad girls go everywhere.'\\" Then-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in a statement said, \\"Today New York City lost a pioneer who reshaped not only the entire media industry, but the nation's culture. She was a role model for the millions of women whose private thoughts, wonders and dreams she addressed so brilliantly in print.\\" Brown's husband David preceded her in death, passing away on February 1, 2010 at the age of 93. In late November 2012, Brown and her husband were buried in adjacent graves at Sisco Cemetery, her maternal family cemetery in Osage, Carroll County, Arkansas. Legacy Seven months prior to her death, continuing the work started with her husband in forming the Helen Gurley Brown Trust, Brown established the Brown Institute for Media Innovation. This institution is housed at both the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and Stanford's Engineering School. Their $38 million donation to the two schools develops journalism in the context of new technologies. Following her death, the trust continues donating much of its fortune to programs that serve the children of New York City and foster advancements in education and technology. $15 million was donated to the New York Public Library, and $7.5 million donated to the American Museum of Natural History. These donations have collectively created new media programs (David and Helen Gurley Brown Institute for Media Innovation at Columbia) and started initiatives to benefit at-risk youth (NYPL BridgeUp) and increase representation of women and minority groups in STEM disciplines (the AMNH BridgeUp:STEM program). Among feminists, Brown's role has been highly contested as empowering women to be unashamed of their sexual urges and as creating a magazine that may live on as a sexist magazine with a body image problem. However, some feminists feel that the sexism in our world cannot be blamed all on Cosmopolitan and Brown, with other magazines circulating that objectify women's bodies. These other people look at Brown's work as both \\"progressive and retrogressive\\" when it comes to the feminist movement.

The plot follows William Legrand, who was bitten by a gold-colored bug. His servant Jupiter fears that Legrand is going insane and goes to Legrand's friend, an unnamed narrator, who agrees to visit his old friend. Legrand pulls the other two into an adventure after deciphering a secret message that will lead to a buried treasure. The story, set on Sullivan's Island, South Carolina, is often compared with Poe's \\"tales of ratiocination\\" as an early form of detective fiction. Poe became aware of the public's interest in secret writing in 1840 and asked readers to challenge his skills as a code-breaker. He took advantage of the popularity of cryptography as he was writing \\"The Gold-Bug\\", and the success of the story centers on one such cryptogram. Modern critics have judged the characterization of Legrand's servant Jupiter as racist, especially because of his comical dialect speech. Poe submitted \\"The Gold-Bug\\" as an entry to a writing contest sponsored by the Philadelphia Dollar Newspaper. His story won the grand prize and was published in three installments, beginning in June 1843. The prize also included $100, probably the largest single sum that Poe received for any of his works. \\"The Gold-Bug\\" was an instant success and was the most popular and most widely read of Poe's works during his lifetime. It also helped popularize cryptograms and secret writing. Plot summary Illustration by \\"Herpin Inv\\" for an early edition William Legrand has relocated from New Orleans to Sullivan's Island in South Carolina after losing his family fortune, and has brought his African-American servant Jupiter with him. The story's narrator, a friend of Legrand, visits him one evening to see an unusual scarab-like bug he has found. The bug's weight and lustrous appearance convince Jupiter that it is made of pure gold. Legrand has lent it to an officer stationed at a nearby fort, but he draws a sketch of it for the narrator, with markings on the carapace that resemble a skull. As they discuss the bug, Legrand becomes particularly focused on the sketch and carefully locks it in his desk for safekeeping. Confused, the narrator takes his leave for the night. One month later, Jupiter visits the narrator on behalf of his master and asks him to come immediately, fearing that Legrand has been bitten by the bug and gone insane. Once they arrive on the island, Legrand insists that the bug will be the key to restoring his lost fortune. He leads them on an expedition to a particular tree and has Jupiter climb it until he finds a skull nailed at the end of one branch. At Legrand's direction, Jupiter drops the bug through one eye socket and Legrand paces out to a spot where the group begins to dig. Finding nothing there, Legrand has Jupiter climb the tree again and drop the bug through the skull's other eye; they choose a different spot to dig, this time finding two skeletons and a chest filled with gold coins and jewelry. They estimate the total value at $1.5 million, but even that figure proves to be below the actual worth when they eventually sell the items. Legrand explains that on the day he found the bug on the mainland coastline, Jupiter had picked up a scrap piece of parchment to wrap it up. Legrand kept the scrap and used it to sketch the bug for the narrator; in so doing, though, he noticed traces of invisible ink, revealed by the heat of the fire burning on the hearth. The parchment proved to contain a cryptogram, which Legrand deciphered as a set of directions for finding a treasure buried by the infamous pirate Captain Kidd. The final step involved dropping a slug or weight through the left eye of the skull in the tree; their first dig failed because Jupiter mistakenly dropped it through the right eye instead. Legrand muses that the skeletons may be the remains of two members of Kidd's crew, who buried the chest and were then killed to silence them. =The cryptogram= The story involves cryptography with a detailed description of a method for solving a simple substitution cipher using letter frequencies.

Using a telescope and sighting at the given bearing, he spotted something white among the branches of a large tree; this proved to be the skull through which a weight had to be dropped from the left eye in order to find the treasure. Analysis Cryptogram letter frequency English letter frequency \\"The Gold-Bug\\" includes a cipher that uses a simple substitution cipher. Though he did not invent \\"secret writing\\" or cryptography (he was probably inspired by an interest in Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe), Poe certainly popularized it during his time. To most people in the 19th century, cryptography was mysterious and those able to break the codes were considered gifted with nearly supernatural ability. Poe had drawn attention to it as a novelty over four months in the Philadelphia publication Alexander's Weekly Messenger in 1840. He had asked readers to submit their own substitution ciphers, boasting he could solve all of them with little effort. The challenge brought about, as Poe wrote, \\"a very lively interest among the numerous readers of the journal. Letters poured in upon the editor from all parts of the country.\\" In July 1841, Poe published \\"A Few Words on Secret Writing\\" and, realizing the interest in the topic, wrote \\"The Gold-Bug\\" as one of the few pieces of literature to incorporate ciphers as part of the story. Poe's character Legrand's explanation of his ability to solve the cipher is very like Poe's explanation in \\"A Few Words on Secret Writing\\". The click beetle Alaus oculatus, along with a longhorn beetle, inspired the fictional \\"gold- bug\\" of Poe's tale. The actual \\"gold-bug\\" in the story is not a real insect. Instead, Poe combined characteristics of two insects found in the area where the story takes place. The Callichroma splendidum, though not technically a scarab but a species of longhorn beetle (Cerambycidae), has a gold head and slightly gold-tinted body. The black spots noted on the back of the fictional bug can be found on the Alaus oculatus, a click beetle also native to Sullivan's Island. Poe's depiction of the African servant Jupiter is often considered stereotypical and racist. Jupiter is depicted as superstitious and so lacking in intelligence that he cannot tell his left from his right. Poe probably included the character after being inspired by a similar character in Sheppard Lee (1836) by Robert Montgomery Bird, which he had reviewed. Black characters in fiction during this time period were not unusual, but Poe's choice to give him a speaking role was. Critics and scholars, however, question if Jupiter's accent was authentic or merely comic relief, suggesting it was not similar to accents used by blacks in Charleston but possibly inspired by Gullah.Weissberg, Liliane. \\"Black, White, and Gold\\", Romancing the Shadow: Poe and Race, J. Gerald Kennedy and Liliane Weissberg, eds. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001: 140‚Äì141. Though the story is often included amongst the short list of detective stories by Poe, \\"The Gold-Bug\\" is not technically detective fiction because Legrand withholds the evidence until after the solution is given.Haycraft, Howard. Murder for Pleasure: The Life and Times of the Detective Story. New York: D. Appleton-Century Company, 1941: 9. Nevertheless, the Legrand character is often compared to Poe's fictional detective C. Auguste Dupin due to his use of \\"ratiocination\\". \\"Ratiocination\\", a term Poe used to describe Dupin's method, is the process by which Dupin detects what others have not seen or what others have deemed unimportant. Publication history and reception An 1875 French translation of \\"The Gold- Bug\\" Poe originally sold \\"The Gold-Bug\\" to George Rex Graham for Graham's Magazine for $52 but asked for it back when he heard about a writing contest sponsored by Philadelphia's Dollar Newspaper.Oberholtzer, Ellis Paxson. The Literary History of Philadelphia. Philadelphia: George W. Jacobs & Co., 1906: 239. Incidentally, Poe did not return the money to Graham and instead offered to make it up to him with reviews he would write. Poe won the grand prize; in addition to winning $100, the story was published in two installments on June 21 and June 28, 1843, in the newspaper. His $100 payment from the newspaper may have been the most he was paid for a single work.Hoffman, Daniel. Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe. Louisiana State University Press, 1998: 189. Anticipating a positive public response, the Dollar Newspaper took out a copyright on \\"The Gold-Bug\\" prior to publication. The story was republished in three installments in the Saturday Courier in Philadelphia on June 24, July 1, and July 8, the last two appeared on the front page and included illustrations by F. O. C. Darley. Further reprintings in United States newspapers made \\"The Gold-Bug\\" Poe's most widely read short story during his lifetime. By May 1844, Poe reported that it had circulated 300,000 copies, though he was probably not paid for these reprints. It also helped increase his popularity as a lecturer. One lecture in Philadelphia after \\"The Gold-Bug\\" was published drew such a large crowd that hundreds were turned away. As Poe wrote in a letter in 1848, it \\"made a great noise.\\" He would later compare the public success of \\"The Gold-Bug\\" with \\"The Raven\\", though he admitted \\"the bird beat the bug\\". The Public Ledger in Philadelphia called it \\"a capital story\\". George Lippard wrote in the Citizen Soldier that the story was \\"characterised by thrilling interest and a graphic though sketchy power of description. It is one of the best stories that Poe ever wrote.\\" Graham's Magazine printed a review in 1845 which called the story \\"quite remarkable as an instance of intellectual acuteness and subtlety of reasoning\\". Thomas Dunn English wrote in the Aristidean in October 1845 that \\"The Gold-Bug\\" probably had a greater circulation than any other American story and \\"perhaps it is the most ingenious story Mr. POE has written; but... it is not at all comparable to the 'Tell-tale Heart'‚Äîand more especially to 'Ligeia'\\". Poe's friend Thomas Holley Chivers said that \\"The Gold-Bug\\" ushered in \\"the Golden Age of Poe's Literary Life\\".Chivers, Thomas Holley. Life of Poe, Richard Beale Davis, ed. E. P. Dutton & Co., Inc., 1952: 36. The popularity of the story also brought controversy. Within a month of its publication, Poe was accused of conspiring with the prize committee by Philadelphia's Daily Forum. The publication called \\"The Gold-Bug\\" an \\"abortion\\" and \\"unmitigated trash\\" worth no more than $15. Poe filed for a libel lawsuit against editor Francis Duffee. It was later dropped and Duffee apologized for suggesting Poe did not earn the $100 prize. Editor John Du Solle accused Poe of stealing the idea for \\"The Gold-Bug\\" from \\"Imogine; or the Pirate's Treasure\\", a story written by a schoolgirl named Miss Sherburne. \\"The Gold-Bug\\" was republished as the first story in the Wiley & Putnam collection of Poe's Tales in June 1845, followed by \\"The Black Cat\\" and ten other stories. The success of this collection inspired the first French translation of \\"The Gold-Bug\\" published in November 1845 by Alphonse Borghers in the Revue BritanniqueSalines, Emily. Alchemy and Amalgam: Translation in the Works of Charles Baudelaire. Amsterdam-New York: Rodopi, 2004: 81‚Äì82. under the title, \\"Le Scarab√©e d'or\\", becoming the first literal translation of a Poe story into a foreign language. In the French version, the enciphered message remained in English, with a parenthesized translation supplied alongside its solution. The story was translated into Russian from that version two years later, marking Poe's literary debut in that country. In 1856, Charles Baudelaire published his translation of the tale in the first volume of Histoires extraordinaires.Salines, Emily. Alchemy and Amalgam: Translation in the Works of Charles Baudelaire. Amsterdam-New York: Rodopi, 2004: 82. Baudelaire was very influential in introducing Poe's work to Europe and his translations became the definitive renditions throughout the continent. Influence \\"The Gold-Bug\\" as it appeared in The Dollar Newspaper, June 21, 1843, with the illustration on the bottom right \\"The Gold- Bug\\" inspired Robert Louis Stevenson in his novel about treasure-hunting, Treasure Island (1883). Stevenson acknowledged this influence: \\"I broke into the gallery of Mr. Poe... No doubt the skeleton [in my novel] is conveyed from Poe.\\" Poe played a major role in popularizing cryptograms in newspapers and magazines in his time period and beyond. William F. Friedman, America's foremost cryptologist, initially became interested in cryptography after reading \\"The Gold-Bug\\" as a child‚Äîinterest that he later put to use in deciphering Japan's PURPLE code during World War II. \\"The Gold-Bug\\" also includes the first use of the term cryptograph (as opposed to cryptogram). Poe had been stationed at Fort Moultrie from November 1827 through December 1828 and utilized his personal experience at Sullivan's Island in recreating the setting for \\"The Gold-Bug\\". It was also here that Poe first heard the stories of pirates like Captain Kidd.Poe, Harry Lee. Edgar Allan Poe: An Illustrated Companion to His Tell-Tale Stories. New York: Metro Books, 2008: 35. The residents of Sullivan's Island embrace this connection to Poe and have named their public library after him.Urbina, Ian. \\"Baltimore Has Poe; Philadelphia Wants Him\\". The New York Times. September 5, 2008: A10. Local legend in Charleston says that the poem \\"Annabel Lee\\" was also inspired by Poe's time in South Carolina.Crawford, Tom. \\"The Ghost by the Sea\\". Retrieved February 1, 2009. Poe also set part of \\"The Balloon-Hoax\\" and \\"The Oblong Box\\" in this vicinity. O. Henry alludes to the stature of \\"The Gold-Bug\\" within the buried- treasure genre in his short story \\"Supply and Demand\\". One character learns that the main characters are searching for treasure, and he asks them if they have been reading Edgar Allan Poe. The title of Richard Powers' 1991 novel The Gold Bug Variations is derived from \\"The Gold-Bug\\" and from Bach's composition Goldberg Variations, and the novel incorporates part of the short story's plot. Jewish Russian author David Shrayer-Petrov published \\"The House of Edgar Allan Poe\\" in 2011 Prose, with \\"The Gold-Bug\\" serving as a major influence. Shrayer-Petrov includes a beetle, also tied to a string, which finds treasure in the basement of the house of Sarah Helen Whitman, Poe's love interest who lived in Providence, Rhode Island.Shrayer-Petrov, D., & Shrayer, M. (2014). Notes and Commentary on the Stories. In Dinner with Stalin and other stories (p. 251). Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press. \\"The Gold-Bug\\" is praised by Red Reddington, the central character of the NBC show The Blacklist, in Season 5, Episode 11.

What a yarn!\\").The Blacklist: Red Praises Edgar Allan Poe‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Gold- Bug‚Äô Story Adaptations The story proved popular enough in its day that a stage version opened on August 8, 1843. The production was put together by Silas S. Steele and was performed at the American Theatre in Philadelphia. The editor of the Philadelphia newspaper The Spirit of the Times said that the performance \\"dragged, and was rather tedious. The frame work was well enough, but wanted filling up\\". In film and television, an adaptation of the work appeared on Your Favorite Story on February 1, 1953 (Season 1, Episode 4). It was directed by Robert Florey with the teleplay written by Robert Libott. A later adaptation of the work appeared on ABC Weekend Special on February 2, 1980 (Season 3, Episode 7). This version was directed by Robert Fuest with the teleplay written by Edward Pomerantz. A Spanish feature film adaptation of the work appeared in 1983 under the title En busca del drag√≥n dorado. It was written and directed by Jes√∫s Franco, using the alias \\"James P. Johnson\\".IMDb: En busca del drag√≥n dorado The 1956 film Manfish was adapted from \\"The Gold- Bug.\\" \\"The Gold Bug\\" episode on the 1980 ABC Weekend Special series starred Roberts Blossom as Legrand, Geoffrey Holder as Jupiter, and Anthony Michael Hall. It won three Daytime Emmy Awards: 1) Outstanding Children's Anthology/Dramatic Programming, Linda Gottlieb (executive producer), Doro Bachrach (producer); 2) Outstanding Individual Achievement in Children's Programming, Steve Atha (makeup and hair designer); and, 3) Outstanding Individual Achievement in Children's Programming, Alex Thomson (cinematographer). It was a co-production of Learning Corporation of America.The Gold Bug. IMDB. A simplified version of the story was included in Murders in the Rue Morgue, and The Gold Bug (1973) by Robert James Dixson, published by Regents Pub. Co. A \\"post-modern\\", anti-racist radio dramatization of the story was transmitted on BBC Radio 4 in 2001. It was written by Gregory Evans, produced and directed by Ned Chaillet, and starred Clarke Peters, Rhashan Stone, and William Hootkins. The cipher used in \\"The Gold-Bug\\" was also used in the novel \\"The Man who Was Poe\\" by Avi. It was used in the story for the antagonists to communicate and is decrypted by its writer, Edgar Allan Poe. \\"The Gold-Bug\\" was produced as a full cast audio drama on the Journey Into... podcast. (2014) Producer: Marshal Latham. Voice actors: Big Anklevich and Rish Outfield. It was adapted into a hidden object puzzle video game for PC and Mac by ERS Studios, published by Big Fish Games, in 2016.

Early life P√©rez is the oldest of eleven brothers and sisters. The P√©rezes are of Sephardi Jewish Anusim origin. While P√©rez was a teenager he became involved in various church singing groups and in the Puerto Rican production of Up with People. He later formed a duo, Silverio y Roxana, that specialized in Puerto Rican music, and as a result, was a guest -and later hosted- a typical Puerto Rican music television program, \\"Borinquen Canta\\", along with news broadcaster Guillermo Jos√© Torres. He later studied Chemical Engineering at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez, but remained active as a part-time singer while completing his studies. He then realized that Engineering, while a lucrative career, did not fulfill his vocation as a singer. During his period as a student of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez, Perez met and befriended such legendary figures as politician Jose Enrique Arraras, basketball star Fufi Santori and sportscaster Elliott Castro.https://www.primerahora.com/entretenimiento/farandula/notas/silverio- perez-celebra-50-anos-de-su-graduacion-del-colegio-de-mayaguez/ (in Spanish) Career P√©rez formally started his career with the singing group Haciendo Punto en Otro Son with four debut concerts at a night club called \\"La Tea\\" in San Juan (October 30 ‚Äì November 2, 1975). This band, whose original members included Irvin Garc√≠a, Jossy Latorre, Nano Cabrera and Tony Croatto, toured all of Puerto Rico and some other countries, recording various albums and 8-tracks. The group faced blacklisting in some Puerto Rican towns due to the political nature of some of its songs, and experienced numerous personnel changes over time (most notably Croatto's, who as a non-native Puerto Rican felt uncomfortable by the situation). Haciendo Punto would \\"break up\\" twice during the 1980s, to be reformed in the late 1990s. After the group went into a hiatus, P√©rez went into Puerto Rican television with the Los Rayos Gamma show. In Los Rayos Gamma, he teamed up with Sunshine Logro√±o, Jacobo Morales and Horacio Olivo to satirize Puerto Rican politics. Later on, he became the show host of the successful program, En Serio Con Silverio. In 1995, he was credited with coining the term chupacabra, referring to creatures around Puerto Rico with a habit of attacking and drinking the blood of livestock, especially goats. In 2000, he debuted in the show Anda Pa'l Car√° on Tele Once (now Univision Puerto Rico); it aired until 2009. * hosting several successful Puerto Rican television shows during his career including the most recent Anda Pa'l Car√°. * performing with the known group of political satire called Los Rayos Gamma (The Gamma Rays) * performing with the nueva trova group called Haciendo Punto en Otro Son. * his motivational lectures which are usually called \\"Humortivaci√≥n\\" (Humortivation). * allegedly coining the term chupacabra to name the mythical creature responsible for various attacks on animals in Puerto Rico, Mexico and the United States Accident and illness In 1989, an electric gate caught P√©rez's right arm and fractured various arm and hand bones, for which he underwent surgery on at least four occasions. On October 31, 2005, P√©rez had a cancerous tumor removed from his prostate. Until then, P√©rez had been fairly successful in hiding his illness from the Puerto Rican public. Works He wrote, in 1996, a book named Humortivaci√≥n (\\"Humortivation\\", a portmanteau of \\"Humor\\" & \\"motivaci√≥n\\"/\\"motivation\\"; published in 1998, ), which promotes motivation through humor. It had two sequels, M√°s Humortivaci√≥n: el camino del √©xito (\\"More Humortivation: the Path for Success\\", 2000, ) and Humortivaci√≥n‚Ä¶ otra vez (\\"Humortivation‚Ä¶ Again\\", 2007, ), plus a follow-up, Domesticando tu dinosario (\\"Domesticating Your Dinosaur\\", 2005, ). In 2004, he wrote El humor nuestro de cada d√≠a: las tres tristes tribus (\\"Our Humor of Every Day: the Three Sad Tribes\\", ), a critique about Puerto Rican politics. The \\"three sad tribes\\" in the title refer to the three local political parties (PPD, PNP, & PIP) that have dominated politics in the island since 1968. It was followed up in 2008 by another political critique, Desde mi gr√∫a: manual del elector aguzao (\\"From My Crane: Manual of the Intelligent Voter\\", ). In 2009 he released Prefiero ser trovador: d√©cimas con amor y humor () as a book + CD bundle, which was later followed in 2011 by Punto decimal: d√©cimas para decir m√°s, also a book + CD bundle. In 2010 he wrote a motivational book, Abracadabra: buenas palabras (\\"Abracadabra: Good Words\\", ). He also wrote Paso a paso‚Ä¶ por el Camino de Santiago: Cr√≥nica de un peregrino (\\"Step by Step‚Ä¶ Through the Road to Santiago: Chronicle of a Peregrine\\", 2014, ), a memoir chronicling his experience during his peregrination to the Santiago de Compostela Cathedral in Galicia, Spain. In 2016 he wrote La vitrina rota o ¬øqu√© carajo pas√≥ aqu√≠? (\\"The Broken Vitrine, or What the Fuck Happened Here?\\", ), in which he offered his \\"introspective view into Puerto Rican history from 1898 to the present\\", with emphasis on why Puerto Rico filed for bankruptcy. During 2017, he also offered conferences in Puerto Rico and in United States about the island's current situation, based on the contents of this book. In 2017 he wrote a novel, Un espejo en la selva (\\"A Mirror in the Jungle\\", ), about a Puerto Rican psychologist kidnapped by FARC militants in Colombia. He has written several books. Two of the most recent ones, Un Espejo en la Selva (2017, a novel) and La vitrina rota o ¬øqu√© carajo pas√≥ aqu√≠? (2016), were awarded by International Latino Book Awards as Best Drama and Historical Book, respectively. He is the composer of songs, among them, the danza dedicated to the island of Vieques (\\"Isla Nena\\"). In 2018 he wrote his memoir book S√≥lo CUENTO con el CUENTO que te CUENTO (\\"I Only COUNT with the TALE I TELL You\\", ), where he told his memories as \\"parent, professional, artist, and Puerto Rican\\". P√©rez writes a column for El Nuevo D√≠a called (Point of View). He gives \\"Humortivacion\\" talks in Puerto Rico and the US, promoting his most recent novel by the same name.

History The Alliance of Baptists was formed in 1987Frank Spencer Mead, Samuel S. Hill, and Craig D. Atwood, Handbook of Denominations in the United States, Abingdon Press, 2001, , p. 46. as the Southern Baptist Alliance by liberal individuals and congregations who were considering separating from the Southern Baptist Convention as a result of the conservative resurgence/fundamentalist takeover controversy.William H. Brackney, Baptists in North America: An Historical Perspective, Wiley, 2006, , p. 138. Since 1995, many Alliance congregations and people have also aligned with several other free church traditions including the American Baptist Churches (USA), the United Church of Christ, and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Theology and practices The Covenant of the Alliance of Baptists lays out seven principles the churches are committed to: the freedom of individuals to interpret Scripture for themselves; the autonomy of the local church including its ability to ordain both men and women; cooperation with other Christians and the wider Church; servant leadership and inclusion for all people in mission and ministry; emphasizing theological education by the support of colleges and seminaries; proclaiming the gospel of Jesus Christ and calling people to repentance, faith, reconciliation, social and economic justice; and the separation of church and state. Covenant and Mission In contrast to the SBC and other conservative Baptists, the Alliance has emphasized women's ministry, encouraging women to seek ordination and senior pastorates, and encourages its congregations toward inclusiveness with respect to homosexuality. In 2014, the Alliance joined a lawsuit challenging North Carolina's ban on same-sex marriage, which is America's first faith- based challenge to same-sex marriage bans.http://www.advocate.com/politics/religion/2014/06/06/rabbis-join- marriage-equality-fight The Alliance has also worked to uphold the separation of church and state through its membership and support of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty. In 2019, the Alliance joined with 42 other religious and allied organizations in issuing a statement opposing Project Blitz, an effort by a coalition of Christian right organizations to influence state legislation. The Alliance has acknowledged its interdependence as Baptists with the whole people of God regardless of denominational designation. That spirit of ecumenism of the Alliance of Baptists can be seen in its willingness to fellowship with any other denomination without regard to its doctrinal character. The Alliance is in ecumenical partnership with groups such as the American Baptist Churches in the USA, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship and the African-American Progressive National Baptist Convention, and in cooperation with the United Church of Christ and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). It is a member of the National Council of Churches and the World Council of Churches. Organization The Alliance of Baptists is organized with a congregationalist polity, and member churches maintain authority over their internal affairs. The Alliance allows churches to cooperate in foreign missions, endorsement for chaplaincy and pastoral counseling, and assistance in placement of ministers in available positions. The latter is carried out in a manner similar to the United Church of Christ and the Disciples. The Alliance of Baptists is governed by a Board of Directors and four officers‚ÄîPresident, Vice-President, Treasurer, and Secretary‚Äîin between the Alliance's Annual Meetings. All actions of the Board of Directors are subject to review during the Annual Meeting. The 23-member Board of Directors and the officers are nominated by the Nominating Committee and elected at the Annual Meeting. Board members serve three-year terms and can be reelected. The Board of Directors has an Executive Committee which oversees the work of the Alliance in between meetings of the Board. Membership in the Alliance is open to churches and individuals who support its Covenant and Mission and contribute financially to its ministries. , approximately 130 congregations are affiliated with the Alliance. Some Alliance churches may still have ties to the SBC and their respective state conventions, although in practically all cases those ties are nominal with little or no financial support or delegates sent to either national or state SBC causes or meetings due to theological and ideological incompatibilities. Some may also hold simultaneous membership in the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, a more moderate group.

It breeds in most of Europe and in the Palearctic to Siberia, and is migratory, wintering in Africa and south western Asia. It is declining in parts of its range. This is an undistinguished looking bird with long wings and tail. The adults have grey-brown upperparts and whitish underparts, with a streaked crown and breast, giving rise to the bird's common name. The legs are short and black, and the bill is black and has the broad but pointed shape typical of aerial insectivores. Juveniles are browner than adults and have spots on the upperparts. Taxonomy The spotted flycatcher was described by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas in 1764 and given the binomial name Motacilla striata. Includes a transcript of the 1764 text. The genus name Muscicapa comes from the Latin musca, a fly and capere, to catch. The specific epithet striata is from the Latin striatus meaning striated.. There are five recognised subspecies all of which winter in southern Africa. The breeding range is given below. * M. s. striata (Pallas, 1764) ‚Äì Europe to west Siberia, northwest Africa * M. s. inexpectata Dementiev, 1932 ‚Äì Crimea (southern Ukraine) * M. s. neumanni Poche, 1904 ‚Äì islands of the Aegean Sea through to the Middle East, the Caucasus, northern Iran and central Siberia * M. s. sarudnyi Snigirewski, 1928 ‚Äì eastern Iran and Turkmenistan to the mountains of central Asia and north Pakistan * M. s. mongola Portenko, 1955 ‚Äì Mongolia and south-central Siberia Two other subspecies were previously recognised, M. s. tyrrhenica and M. s. balearica. However, a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2016 found that they were genetically similar to each other but significantly different from the other spotted flycatcher subspecies. The authors proposed that these insular subspecies should be considered as a separate species. The International Ornithologists' Union has split the species and it is known as the Mediterranean flycatcher, while other taxonomic authorities still consider it to be conspecific. Description The spotted flycatcher is a small slim bird, around in length, with a weight of . It has dull grey-brown upperparts and off-white underparts. The crown, throat and breast are streaked with brown while the wings and tail feathers are edged with paler thin margins. The subspecies M. s. tyrrhenica has paler and warmer plumage on the upperparts, with more diffuse markings on the head and breast. The sexes are alike. Juveniles have ochre-buff spots above and scaly brown spots below. Behaviour and ecology Spotted flycatchers hunt from conspicuous perches, making sallies after passing flying insects, and often returning to the same perch. Their upright posture is characteristic. Most passerines moult their primary flight feathers in sequence beginning near the body and proceeding outwards along the wing. The spotted flycatcher is unusual in replacing the outer flight feathers before those nearer the body. The flycatcher's call is a thin, drawn out soft and high pitched ', slightly descending in pitch. =Breeding= They are birds of deciduous woodlands, parks and gardens, with a preference for open areas amongst trees. They build an open nest in a suitable recess, often against a wall, and will readily adapt to an open- fronted nest box. 4-6 eggs are laid. Most European birds cannot discriminate between their own eggs and those of other species. The exception to this are the hosts of the common cuckoo, which have had to evolve this skill as a protection against that nest parasite. The spotted flycatcher shows excellent egg recognition, and it is likely that it was once a host of the cuckoo, but became so good at recognising the intruder's eggs that it ceased to be victimised. A contrast to this is the dunnock, which appears to be a recent cuckoo host, since it does not show any egg discrimination. Predation A study conducted at two different locations in southern England found that one third of nests were predated. The Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius) was the most common aerial predator, consuming both eggs and chicks. The domestic cat (Felis catus) predated a small fraction of the nests.

Its colourful golden crest feathers, as well as being called the \\"king of the birds\\" in European folklore, gives rise to its English and scientific names. The scientific name, R. regulus, means king or knight.All about the goldcrest Several subspecies are recognised across the very large distribution range that includes much of the Palearctic and the islands of Macaronesia and Iceland. Birds from the north and east of its breeding range migrate to winter further south. This kinglet has greenish upper-parts, whitish under-parts, and has two white wingbars. It has a plain face contrasting black irises and a bright head crest, orange and yellow in the male and yellow in the female, which is displayed during breeding. It superficially resembles the common firecrest, which largely shares its European range, but the latter's bronze shoulders and strong face pattern are distinctive. The song is a repetition of high thin notes, slightly higher-pitched than those of its relative. Birds on the Canary Islands are now separated into two subspecies of the goldcrest, but were formerly considered to be a subspecies of the firecrest or a separate species, Regulus teneriffae. The goldcrest breeds in coniferous woodland and gardens, building its compact, three-layered nest on a tree branch. Ten to twelve eggs are incubated by the female alone, and the chicks are fed by both parents; second broods are common. This kinglet is constantly on the move as it searches for insects to eat, and in winter it is often found with flocks of tits. It may be killed by birds of prey or carry parasites, but its large range and population mean that it is not considered to present any significant conservation concerns.  Description  The goldcrest is the smallest European bird, in length, with a wingspan and a weight of . It is similar in appearance to a warbler, with olive-green upper-parts, buff-white underparts, two white wing bars, and a plain face with conspicuous black irises. The crown of the head has black sides and a narrow black front, and a bright crest, yellow with an orange centre in the male, and entirely yellow in the female; the crest is erected in display, making the distinctive orange stripe of the male much more conspicuous. The small, thin bill is black, and the legs are dark flesh-brown. Apart from the crest colour, the sexes are alike, although in fresh plumage, the female may have very slightly paler upper-parts and greyer underparts than the adult male. The juvenile is similar to the adult, but has duller upper-parts and lacks the coloured crown. Although the tail and flight feathers may be retained into the first winter, by then the young birds are almost indistinguishable from adults in the field. The flight is distinctive; it consists of whirring wing-beats with occasional sudden changes of direction. Shorter flights while feeding are a mix of dashing and fluttering with frequent hovering. It moves restlessly among foliage, regularly creeping on branches and up and down trunks. = Identification = The nominate subspecies, R. r. regulus, in Belgium. The goldcrest has a bright crest and a relatively plain face. The orange tinge of the hindcrown indicates that this is a male. The goldcrest is usually easily distinguished from other small birds in its range, but poor views could possibly lead to confusion with the common firecrest or yellow-browed warbler. The adult common firecrest has a distinguishing face pattern showing a bright white supercilium (eyebrow) and black eye-stripe, and the juvenile usually shows enough of this face pattern to be readily distinguished from the plain-faced goldcrest. The yellow-browed warbler has a yellowish supercilium and pale crown stripe, so also shows a different head pattern. The ruby-crowned kinglet, an American Regulus species and a potential vagrant in Europe, could be more difficult to distinguish. It has a plain face like its Old World cousin, but the male has a red crest without any yellow or a black border. Female and juvenile ruby-crowned kinglets lack the ruby-red crown patch, but compared with the similarly crestless juvenile goldcrest, the American bird is larger in size, has an obvious whitish eyering, and yellowish wing bars.  Voice  Song of the male goldcrest, near Camberley Male in France displaying orange crest feathers that are set within a narrow rim of yellow feathers The typical contact call of the goldcrest is a thin, high-pitched zee given at intervals of 1‚Äì4 seconds, with all the notes at the same pitch. It sometimes has a more clipped ending, or is delivered more rapidly. The call is higher and less rough than that of the firecrest. The song of the male goldcrest is a very high, thin double note cedar, repeated 5‚Äì7 times and ending in a flourish, '. The entire song lasts 3‚Äì4 seconds and is repeated 5‚Äì7 times a minute. This song, often uttered while the male is foraging, can be heard in most months of the year. There is also a subdued rambling subsong. Male goldcrests sometimes show a territorial response to recordings of the songs or calls of the common firecrest, but the reverse is apparently not true, since the songs of the common firecrest are simpler in construction than those of its relatives. The songs of mainland goldcrests vary only slightly across their range and consist of a single song type, but much more divergence has occurred in the isolated Macaronesian populations. Not only are there variations between islands and within an island, but individual males on the Azores can have up to three song types. The dialects on the Azores fall into two main groups, neither of which elicited a response from male European goldcrests in playback experiments. There are also two main dialect groups on the Canary islands, a widespread group similar to the European version, and another that is restricted to the mountains of Tenerife. The song variations have been used to investigate the colonisation pattern of the Macaronesian islands by goldcrests, and identified a previously unknown subspecies.  Taxonomy  The kinglets are a small group of birds sometimes included in the Old World warblers, but frequently given family status, especially as recent research shows that despite superficial similarities, they are phylogenetically remote from the warblers. The names of the family, Regulidae, and its only genus, Regulus, are derived from the Latin , a diminutive of , a king. The goldcrest was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his in 1758 as Motacilla regulus (characterised as ). It was moved to the warbler genus Sylvia by English naturalist John Latham in 1790, and to its current genus by French zoologist Georges Cuvier in 1800. The relationships of the flamecrest or Taiwan firecrest (Regulus goodfellowi) of Taiwan have also been a source of much debate. It is sometimes viewed as a race of firecrest, but its territorial song resembles those of the Himalayan races of goldcrest, and genetic data show that it is the closest relative of that species, and, despite its alternative name, only distantly related to the firecrest. The flamecrest diverged from the goldcrest 3.0‚Äì3.1 mya (million years ago). = Subspecies =  Continental Eurasia  Female R. r. regulus in England R. r. japonensis in Japan R. r. sikkimensis from Pangolakha Wildlife Sanctuary in Sikkim, India. Several subspecies of the goldcrest have been described. In continental Eurasia, there are nine generally accepted and very similar subspecies, differing only in details such as plumage shade. At the genetic level, the two Central Asian forms, R. r. sikkimensis and R. r. himalayensis, are very close to each other, and have differentiated only in the recent past, but they diverged from the western subspecies around 2.8 mya. * R. r. regulus (Linnaeus, 1758). Breeds in most of Europe; this is the nominate subspecies. * R. r. himalayensis (Bonaparte, 1856). Breeds in the Himalayas; it is similar to the nominate subspecies, but slightly paler above and with whiter underparts. * R. r. japonensis (Blakiston, 1862). Breeds in Eastern Asia, including Japan, Korea, China and Siberia; it is greener and has darker upper- parts than the nominate form, and has broad white wingbars. * R. r. tristis (Pleske, 1892). Breeds in China and Central Asia, wintering in northeastern Afghanistan. Records of this race from Ladakh claimed by Meinertzhagen are considered to be fraudulent. It is distinctive, with the black edges to the crest largely absent. The crown of the male is yellower than in other forms, and the underparts are much duller and greyer. * R. r. coatsi (Sushkin, 1904). Breeds in Russia and Central Asia, and is paler above than the nominate subspecies. * R. r. yunnanensis (Rippon, 1906). Breeds in the Eastern Himalayas, Burma and China; it is like R. r. sikkimensis, but darker overall with dark green upper-parts and darker buff underparts. * R. r. hyrcanus (Zarudny, 1910). Breeds only in Iran; it is like R. r. buturlini, but slightly darker. * R. r. buturlini (Loudon, 1911). Breeds in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is paler above than the nominate subspecies, and greyish-green rather than olive. * R. r. sikkimensis (Meinertzhagen R. & Meinertzhagen A., 1926). Breeds in India and China. It is darker than R. r. himalayensis, and greener than the nominate subspecies. Probable male R. r. himalayensis has paler underparts than the European race.  The Atlantic islands  Two groups of goldcrest taxa are found on the Atlantic islands of Macaronesia. Birds on the Canary Islands are ancient colonists, whereas those on The Azores are of more recent origin. There are no goldcrests on Madeira, where the Madeira firecrest is the only Regulus species. The Canary Islands were colonised in two waves. The first step was the occupation of Tenerife and La Gomera 1.9‚Äì2.3 million years ago, followed by a separate invasion of El Hierro and La Palma 1.3‚Äì1.8 mya. Birds from the Canary Islands are particularly distinctive having a black forehead, pink-buff underparts and a darker closed wing, and have been sometimes treated either as a subspecies of the common firecrest or as a different Regulus species altogether. They were sometimes called the Tenerife goldcrest, no matter which of the islands they lived on; however, a 2006 study of the vocalisations of these birds indicate that they actually comprise two subspecies of the goldcrest that are separable on voice; R. r. teneriffae occurring on Tenerife and the newly described subspecies, R. r. ellenthalerae, the western Canary Islands goldcrest, occurring on the smaller islands of La Palma and El Hierro. The recently discovered subspecies R. r. ellenthalerae occurs in laurisilva forest on La Palma (above) and El Hierro. * Tenerife goldcrest R. r. teneriffae (Seebohm, 1883). Found on Tenerife and La Gomera, Canary Islands; it is a distinctive, small subspecies with a black forehead and pink-buff underparts. * Western Canary Islands goldcrest R. r. ellenthalerae (P√§ckert et al., 2006). Resident on La Palma and El Hierro, Canary Islands. Differences in songs, genetics and morphology suggests that the Azores were colonised in a single invasion in the late Pleistocene, about 100,000 years ago. It is likely that the initial colonisation was of the easternmost islands, with a subsequent spread to the central and western island groups from the western caldera of S√£o Miguel, where both eastern and western song types are found. * Sao Miguel Goldcrest R. r. azoricus (Seebohm, 1883). Found only on S√£o Miguel, Azores; it is like R. r. inermis, except the underparts are more olive-buff. * Western Azores goldcrest R. r. inermis (Murphy & Chapin, 1929). Resident on Flores, Faial, Terceira, S√£o Jorge and Pico, Azores; its upper-parts are a darker olive-green than those of the nominate form, and the underparts are also darker. * Santa Maria goldcrest R. r. sanctaemariae (Vaurie, 1954). Found only on Santa Maria Island (Azores); it is paler than other Azores subspecies and whitish below. = Fossils = There are a few Pleistocene (2.6 million to 12,000 years BP) records from Europe of extant Regulus species, mostly goldcrests or unidentifiable to species. The only fossil of an extinct Regulus is a left ulna from 2.6‚Äì1.95 mya in Bulgaria, which was identified as belonging to an extinct species, Regulus bulgaricus. The goldcrest lineage diverged from this apparent ancestor of the common firecrest in the Middle Pleistocene.  Distribution and habitat  The silver fir, a favoured nesting tree The goldcrest breeds in mature lowland and mountain coniferous woodlands, mainly up to , and occasionally to . It uses spruce, larch, Scots pine, silver fir and mountain pine, and in man-made landscapes also introduced conifers such as douglas fir. Breeding densities of up to 591 pairs per square km (1,530 pairs per square mile) have been recorded in Norway spruce in Ireland, and goldcrests constituted over 60% of all birds found in Welsh Douglas fir and Norway spruce plantations. Broad-leaved woods are used only when some spruce or firs are also present. Sites such as parks and cemeteries are used only when they offer suitable conifers that are not otherwise locally available. The height and nature of any undergrowth is irrelevant. Unlike more specialised birds such as the Eurasian nuthatch and the Eurasian treecreeper, both of which forage on tree trunks, the kinglets do not need large woodlands, and their population density is independent of forest size. Once breeding is over, this species will readily move into deciduous trees and shrubs, heathland and similar more open habitats. The Tenerife subspecies occurs in the mountain region previously occupied by laurisilva, but now dominated by tree heaths. It is common only in that habitat, becoming rare in pine forest, where it occurs only where tree-heath is also available. The goldcrest has a huge range in Eurasia, breeding from Macaronesia to Japan. It is common in middle and northern temperate and boreal latitudes of Europe, between the July isotherms, and thus predominantly in cooler climates than the firecrest. Further east it occurs discontinuously through southern Siberia to Sakhalin and Japan, in the Tian Shan mountains, northern Iran, and from the Himalayas east to central China. This species has bred in Iceland since about 1999, and was widespread by 2004, although numbers are affected by hard winters. Breeding occurs intermittently in the Faroes. The goldcrest has occurred as a vagrant in Jordan and Morocco. On foggy or overcast nights, goldcrests and other disorientated migrants can be attracted to lighthouses in large numbers. This species is partly migratory, northernmost populations deserting their breeding areas in winter. Birds winter in Europe and Asia south of the breeding range. Birds in northern Fennoscandia and Russia vacate their territories between late August and early November, with most leaving in late September to mid-October as the first cold weather arrives. Adverse conditions may lead to disorientation, large numbers gathering on ships on overcast or wet nights. Large influxes include 15,000 birds on the Isle of May in October 1982, and nearly 21,000 birds through a single site in Latvia during September and October 1983. Spring migration is complete by late March on the Mediterranean islands, but continues to late April or early May in northern Europe. The spring passage is much lighter than in autumn, suggesting high mortality on migration. A study in the Baltic region showed that northern goldcrests were more likely to migrate, and increased their body mass beforehand; non-migratory southern birds did not increase their fat reserves. The travel speed of migrating goldcrests increased for those leaving later in the autumn, and was greater for the northernmost populations. Migration was faster on routes that crossed the Baltic Sea than on coastal routes, and the birds with the largest fat reserves travelled at the highest speeds. The ability to lay down fat is adversely affected in this tiny bird by poor health. In Hungary, goldcrests stopping temporarily on migration were mostly found in scrub, including blackthorn, hawthorn and pear, which provided some protection from sparrowhawks. Females migrated slightly earlier than males, but overall there were more males, with an average sex ratio of 1.6:1. Goldcrests can fly in one day, although they keep at a lower level in heavy headwinds. This is a tame and inquisitive bird, and tired migrants will land near or on humans, sometimes searching for food on their clothing. The North Atlantic oscillation is an atmospheric phenomenon affecting the weather in Western Europe. When the atmospheric pressure variations in the North Atlantic are large, the springs in Europe are warmer. This brings forward the northward migration of those bird species (including the goldcrest) that winter mainly within western or southern Europe. A general climatic change resulting in more frequent positive North Atlantic oscillation events has led to earlier spring migration of these short-distance migrants since the 1980s. The warmer spring weather brings on plant growth, thus preparing the habitat for returning migrants. The effect is greatest in western and central Europe.  Behaviour  = Breeding = The goldcrest is monogamous. The male sings during the breeding season, usually while foraging rather than from a perch. It has a display involving bowing its head towards another bird and raising the coloured crest. Firecrests will sometimes defend their territories against goldcrests, but the amount of actual competition between the species may not be very great. A Spanish study suggested that territorial conflicts between species, and other phenomena like males singing mixed or alternating songs, were most frequent when one species locally far outnumbered the other; in other circumstances, the two species learned to ignore each other's songs. However, in very small areas of conifers it is rare for the goldcrest and the firecrest to share territories; either one or the other is present, but not both. A male goldcrest will defend his territory against either species, sometimes including some firecrest phrases in his song. The goldcrest's nest is a well-insulated cup-shaped structure built in three layers. The nest's outer layer is made from moss, small twigs, cobwebs and lichen, the cobwebs also being used to attach the nest to the thin branches that support it. The middle layer is moss, which is lined by an inner layer of feathers and hair. The nest is larger, shallower and less compact than that of the firecrest, with an internal diameter of about , and is constructed by both sexes, although the female does most of the work. It is often suspended from a hanging branch, usually at no great height, although Eric Simms reported nests at heights from . One pair built their nest just above that of a sparrowhawk. A Natural History of the Nests and Eggs of British Birds -Goldcrest -plate 132-cropped.jpgOld drawing of a nest and small branches of a conifer tree Regulus regulus regulus MHNT.ZOO.2010.11.207.jpg Regulus regulus regulus ‚Äì MHNT Regulus regulus azoricus MHNT.ZOO.2010.11.207.jpg Regulus regulus azoricus ‚Äì MHNT Regulus regulus inermis MHNT.ZOO.2010.11.207.jpg Regulus regulus inermis ‚Äì MHNT Regulus regulus teneriffae MHNT.ZOO.2010.11.jpg Regulus regulus teneriffae ‚Äì MHNT Laying starts at the end of April into early May. The eggs are whitish with very indistinct buff, grey or brown markings at the broad end. The eggs are and weigh , of which 5% is shell. The clutch size in Europe is typically 9‚Äì11 eggs, but ranges from 6‚Äì13. The eggs are piled up in the nest and the female keeps the eggs warm with her brood patch and also by putting her warm legs into the middle of the pile between the eggs. Within a clutch the size of eggs increases gradually and the last laid egg may be 20% larger than the first egg. Second clutches, which are common, are laid usually while the first nest still has young. The male builds the second nest, then feeds the young in the first nest while the female is incubating in the second; when the first brood has fledged, he joins the female in feeding the second brood. The female goldcrest is not normally fed by her mate while incubating. She is a tight sitter, reluctant to leave the nest when disturbed, and has been recorded as continuing to attend the nest when it has been moved, or even when it is being held. The eggs are maintained at , the female regulating the temperature of the eggs by varying the time spent sitting. She leaves the nest more with increasing air temperature, and incubates more tightly when the light intensity is lower early and late in the day. The female incubates the eggs for 16 to 19 days to hatching, and broods the chicks, which fledge in a further 17 to 22 days later. Both parents feed the chicks and fledged young, and in very hot weather, the female has been noted as taking drops of water to her chicks in her bill. This species becomes sexually mature after one year, and has an annual adult mortality of over 80 percent giving a life expectancy of around eight months, which is the shortest for any bird apart from a few Coturnix species.Ricklefs, R E; \\"Sibling competition, hatching asynchrony, incubation period, and lifespan in altricial birds\\" in There are nonetheless records of an individual surviving to 4 years 10 months, and even a report of a bird ringed in Winchester in 1989 and found dead in Morocco 7 years and 7 months later. Although their ranges overlap substantially, hybridisation between goldcrests and firecrests seems to be prevented by differences in courtship rituals and different facial patterns. Even in aviary studies in which a female goldcrest was given an artificial eyestripe to facilitate mating with a male firecrest, the chicks were never raised by the mixed pair, and appeared to be poorly adapted compared to the parent species. = Feeding = thumb All Regulus species are almost exclusively insectivorous, preying on small arthropods with soft cuticles, such as springtails, aphids and spiders. They also feed on the cocoons and eggs of spiders and insects, and occasionally take pollen. All species will catch flying insects while hovering. Although the similarly sized goldcrest and firecrest are often found together, there are a number of factors that minimise direct competition for food. Goldcrests prefer smaller prey than common firecrests. Although both will take trapped insects from spider webs on autumn migration, firecrests will also eat the large orb-web spiders (on rare occasions kinglets have been found stuck in a spider web, either unable to move or dead).Martens, Jochen; P√§ckert, Martin \\"Family Regulidae (Kinglets & Firecrests)\\" pp. 330‚Äì349 in The goldcrest takes a wide variety of prey, especially spiders, caterpillars, bugs, springtails and flies. Larger prey such as oak bush crickets and tortrix moths may sometimes be taken. Flying insects are taken in hovering flight but not normally pursued; there is a record of a goldcrest attacking a large dragonfly in flight, only to be dragged along by the insect before releasing it unharmed. Goldcrests will occasionally feed on the ground among leaf-litter with tits. Non-animal food is rare, although goldcrests have been seen drinking sap from broken birch twigs together with tits and nuthatches. The goldcrest feeds in trees, frequently foraging on the undersides of branches and leaves. This is in contrast to the common firecrest, which mainly exploits the upper surface of branches in coniferous habitat and of leaves in deciduous trees. In winter, flocks of goldcrests cover a given distance at only one-third of the speed of common firecrests, taking the smallest prey items ignored by their relative. The differences in behaviour are facilitated by subtle morphological differences; firecrests have broader bills with longer rictal bristles (which protect a bird's eye from food items it is trying to capture), and these features reflect the larger prey taken by the species. The firecrest's less forked tail may reflect its longer episodes of hovering while hunting. Firecrests forage more often while on foot, and have a foot better adapted for perching, whereas the goldcrest's longer hind toe reflects its habit of moving vertically along branches while feeding. It also has deep furrows in the soles of its feet capable of gripping individual needles, while firecrests have a smoother surface. The goldcrest has much the same range and habitat preference as the common chiffchaff, and there is some evidence that high breeding densities of the kinglet depress the population of the warbler, although the converse is not true. There is no evidence that the species compete for territories, and in any case the chiffchaff is 50% heavier than the goldcrest. Nevertheless, there are 1.5 million breeding pairs of goldcrests in Finland, compared with 0.4 million breeding pairs of chiffchaffs, and only the kinglet has increased in numbers as the area of spruce woodland in the country has expanded. The goldcrest may be out-competing the warbler for food, especially as the larger bird faces more competition from other insectivores, including other Phylloscopus warblers. Both birds occur in similar forests, but the chiffchaff is found within of the forest edge, with the goldcrest breeding deeper in the woodland. Nevertheless, there is no conclusive evidence that the decline of the chiffchaff subspecies Phylloscopus collybita abietinus in parts of Finland is due to competition with the willow warbler and goldcrest. Outside the breeding season, small groups of goldcrests maintain exclusive winter feeding territories, which they defend against neighbouring groups. As they roam around their territory, they frequently join loose flocks of other wanderers such as tits and warblers. This kinglet, like other species that prefer mixed-species foraging flocks in winter, hunts over a greater range of heights and vegetation types than when feeding alone. For species that tend to feed in flocks, foraging success while in a flock was about twice that for solitary birds. A consequence of feeding in a flock is that foraging sites may be restricted to avoid competition with other species. In a Swedish study, coal tits and goldcrests foraged in the outer foliage, while the larger willow and European crested tits used the inner canopy. In sites where the numbers of willow and crested tits was artificially reduced, goldcrests and coal tits extended their foraging to include the inner canopy, but did not do so where the larger tits were retained. In some areas, wintering birds have developed the habit of coming to feeding stations and bird tables to take fat, sometimes with warblers such as the common chiffchaff and blackcap. =Winter survival= Goldcrest ‚Äì Winter ‚Äì Mote Park, Maidstone, Kent, UK Several small passerine species survive freezing winter nights by inducing a lower metabolic rate and hypothermia, of a maximum of below normal body temperature, in order to reduce energy consumption overnight. However, in freezing conditions, it may be that for very small birds, including the tiny goldcrest, the energy economies of induced hypothermia may be insufficient to counterbalance the negative effects of hypothermia including the energy required to raise body temperature back to normal at dawn. Observations of five well-fed birds suggest that they maintain normal body temperatures during cold nights by metabolising fat laid down during the day, and that they actually use behavioural thermoregulation strategies, such as collective roosting in dense foliage or snow holes to survive winter nights. Two birds roosting together reduce their heat loss by a quarter, and three birds by a third. During an 18‚Äëhour winter night, with temperatures as low as in the north of its range, goldcrests huddled together can each burn off fat equivalent to 20% of body weight to keep warm. Migrating birds rely largely on stored fat and they also metabolise protein as a supplementary source of energy. Those with a relatively large amount of fat, may make stops during migration of only 1‚Äì2 days; although they have lost weight since commencing their journey, they have enough energy reserves to reach the wintering areas. The proportion of migrating males increases as they travel south through Europe. There is competition within the species even during migration, and the larger and more aggressive males may get more food. Their death rate is therefore lower than that of the females both on the southward migration, and in resident populations.  Predators and parasites  Throughout the goldcrest's range, the main predator of small woodland birds is the Eurasian sparrowhawk, which has a diet consisting of up to 98% of birds. Merlins, tawny and long-eared owls also hunt goldcrests. The erratic movements and flights of small woodland birds, which are vulnerable to attack while away from cover, may help to confuse their predators. The goldcrest has only very rarely been recorded as a host of the common cuckoo, a widespread European brood parasite. The goldcrest is a host of the widespread moorhen flea, Dasypsyllus gallinulae, and of the louse Philopterus reguli. The amblycerous mite Ricinus frenatus has been found on the eastern goldcrest subspecies, R. r. japonensis in Japan, and at the other end of the range in birds of the nominate subspecies on the Faroes and in Spain. These lice move over the host's body, and have strong mouthparts that pierce the host's skin so that they can feed on blood, and sometimes feather material. A number of feather mites have been recorded in the genus Regulus; these mites live on fungi growing on the feathers. Retrieved 22 October 2010 The fungi found on the plumage may feed on the keratin of the outer feathers or on feather oil.  Status  The goldcrest has a large range, estimated at 13.2 million km2 (5.1 million mi2) and a total population estimated at 80‚Äì200 million individuals, and it is therefore classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. There was some northward range expansion in Scotland, Belgium, Norway, and Finland during the 20th century, assisted by the spread of conifer plantations. The population is currently stable, although there may be temporary marked declines in harsh winters. Although dense conifer growth can provide shelter for roosting at night, losses in hard winters can be heavy. In a Finnish study, only one-tenth of the wintering goldcrest population, which mainly fed on spiders, survived to spring. Each group roamed within a defined winter territory, and their winter survival depended on the density of the food supply. For these northern birds there is a trade off between staying put and risking starvation, or facing the perils of migration. Even in somewhat milder regions, where over-wintering is normal, exceptionally cold winters can cause such heavy losses that breeding populations take several years to recover. In 1930, the English ornithologist Thomas Coward wrote: > Until the severe winter of 1916‚Äì17 the Goldcrest was abundant and > widespread, nesting in all the wooded portions of our islands; in 1920 it > could have little more than an obituary notice, for the nesting stock was > practically \\"wiped out.\\" ... and for some years, even as a winter visitor, > the Goldcrest remained rare, absent from most of its nesting haunts. It is, > however, now fully re-established. Conversely, populations can expand rapidly after a series of mild winters. In lowland Britain, there was an increase of 48% following the 1970/71 winter, with many pairs spreading into deciduous woodlands where they would not normally breed.  In culture  John Moore. Fishermen in Suffolk referred to the goldcrest as the \\"herring spink\\". Aristotle (384‚Äì322 BC) and Pliny (23‚Äì79 AD) both wrote about the legend of a contest among the birds to see who should be their king, the title to be awarded to the one that could fly highest. Initially, it looked as though the eagle would win easily, but as he began to tire, a small bird that had hidden under the eagle's tail feathers emerged to fly even higher and claimed the title. Following from this legend, in much European folklore the wren has been described as the \\"king of the birds\\" or as a flame bearer. However, these terms were also applied to the Regulus species, the fiery crowns of the goldcrest and firecrest making them more likely to be the original bearers of these titles, and, because of the legend's reference to the \\"smallest of birds\\" becoming king, the title was probably transferred to the equally tiny wren. The confusion was probably compounded by the similarity and consequent interchangeability of the Greek words for the wren ( , \\"king\\") and the crests ( , \\"kinglet\\"). In English, the association between the goldcrest and Eurasian wren may have been reinforced by the kinglet's old name of \\"gold-crested wren\\". It has had little other impact on literature, although it is the subject of Charles Tennyson Turner's short poem, \\"The Gold-crested Wren\\", first published in 1868. Retrieved 14 November 2010 An old English name for the goldcrest is the \\"woodcock pilot\\", since migrating birds preceded the arrival of Eurasian woodcocks by a couple of days. There are unfounded legends that the goldcrest would hitch a ride in the feathers of the larger bird, and similar stories claimed that owls provided the transport. Suffolk fishermen called this bird \\"herring spink\\" or \\"tot o'er seas\\" because migrating goldcrests often landed on the rigging of herring boats out in the North Sea. \\"Spink\\" is an old name for a finch.

It breeds in most of temperate Europe and northwestern Africa, and is partially migratory, with birds from central Europe wintering to the south and west of their breeding range. Firecrests in the Balearic Islands and north Africa are widely recognised as a separate subspecies, but the population on Madeira, previously also treated as a subspecies, is now treated as a distinct species, the Madeira firecrest, Regulus madeirensis. A fossil ancestor of the firecrest has been identified from a single wing bone. This kinglet is greenish above and has whitish underparts. It has two white wingbars, a black eye stripe and a white supercilium. The head crest, orange in the male and yellow in the female, is displayed during breeding, and gives rise to the English and scientific names for the species. This bird superficially resembles the goldcrest, which largely shares its European range, but the firecrest's bronze shoulders and strong face pattern are distinctive. The song is a repetition of high thin notes, slightly lower-pitched than those of its relative. The common firecrest breeds in broadleaved or coniferous woodland and gardens, building its compact, three-layered nest on a tree branch. Seven to twelve eggs are incubated by the female alone. Both parents feed the chicks, which fledge 22‚Äì24 days after hatching. This kinglet is constantly on the move and frequently hovers as it searches for insects to eat, and in winter it is often found with flocks of tits. Despite some possible local declines, the species is not the subject of significant conservation concerns owing to its large European population and an expansion of its range over the last century. It may be hunted and killed by birds of prey, and can carry parasites. It is possible that this species was the original \\"king of the birds\\" in European folklore.  Description  The common firecrest is a small plump bird, in length with a wingspan of , and weighs . It has bright olive-green upperparts with a bronze-coloured patch on each shoulder, and whitish underparts washed with brownish-grey on the breast and flanks. It has two white wingbars, a tiny black pointed bill, and brownish-black legs. The head pattern is striking, with a black eye stripe, long white supercilium, and a crest which is bright yellow in the female and mainly orange in the male. The sexes are very similar, apart from the crest colour, although the female is a little duller in plumage and on average slightly smaller. Juveniles have a grey tinge to the duller upperparts, and lack the coloured crown; the other head markings are present, but duller than in the adult. By their first winter, only the flight and tail feathers remain unmoulted, and the young birds are virtually indistinguishable from the adults in the field. This kinglet usually hops with its body held horizontally, and its flight is weak and whirring, with occasional quick evasive turns. Adult firecrests are unlikely to be confused with any other species; Pallas's warbler has a similar head and wing pattern, but its crown stripe is pale lemon, not bright yellow or orange, and its supercilium is also pale yellow, not bright white. The juvenile common firecrest might be confused with the goldcrest, but usually shows enough face pattern to distinguish it from its relative, which has a very plain face at all ages. The firecrest can also be separated from Pallas's warbler by the warbler's pale crown stripe and yellow rump. There is more likelihood of confusing the juvenile firecrest with the yellow-browed warbler, which has a similar head pattern; the warbler (an Asiatic species) has pale fringes to the feathers of the closed wing, a whitish belly and darker brown legs. The yellow-browed warbler also lacks the pale half circle present below the young firecrest's eye.  Taxonomy and systematics  A temporarily stunned adult male found on a pavement in Lille, France. The pattern on its head is seen clearly. The kinglets are a small group of birds sometimes included in the Old World warblers, but frequently given family status, especially as recent research shows that, despite superficial similarities, the crests are phylogenetically remote from the warblers. The names of the family, Regulidae, and its only genus, Regulus, are derived from the Latin regulus, a diminutive of rex, \\"a king\\", and refer to the characteristic orange or yellow crests of adult kinglets. The common firecrest was first formally described by Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1820 as Sylvia ignicapilla; the relatively late identification of this common European bird arose from a perception that it was just a variety of the goldcrest. The species name is derived from Latin ignis \\"fire\\" and capillus \\"hair\\". The binomial is frequently given as R. ignicapillus due to a misunderstanding of Latin grammar. There are two widely recognised subspecies of common firecrest, nominate R. i. ignicapilla and Mediterranean R. i. balearicus (Jordans, 1923). The latter form is found on the Balearic Islands and in north Africa, and is slightly paler below and greyer above than the nominate subspecies. Other subspecies have been claimed, including southeastern R. i. caucasicus, North African R. i. laeneni, and Crimean R. i. tauricus. The Madeira firecrest, R. madeirensis, was formerly also considered to be a subspecies of the common firecrest, but phylogenetic analysis based on the cytochrome b gene showed that the Madeiran form is distinct at the species level. Cytochrome b gene divergence between the Madeira firecrest and the European bird is 8.5%, comparable with the divergence level between other recognised Regulus species, such as the 9% between the goldcrest and the golden-crowned kinglet.Martens, Jochen; P√§ckert, Martin \\"Family Regulidae (Kinglets & Firecrests)\\" pp. 330‚Äì349 in The island form also differs in morphology and vocalisations. The proposed split was accepted by the Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC) in 2003, although some authorities, like The Clements checklist, have not yet recognised the new species. The flamecrest or Taiwan firecrest (Regulus goodfellowi) of Taiwan has sometimes been viewed as a race of the common firecrest; however, the flamecrest's territorial song, which resembles those of the Himalayan races of the goldcrest, and genetic data indicate that the flamecrest is closely related to the Himalayan goldcrest and only distantly to the two firecrest species. The kinglets on the Canary Islands, which were also considered to be close to firecrests, have now been shown to comprise two subspecies of goldcrest. = Fossils = There are a few Pleistocene (2.6 million to 12,000 years ago) records from Europe and Israel of extant Regulus species, mostly goldcrests or unidentifiable to species, but also a Spanish specimen of firecrest. A left ulna from Bulgaria was identified as belonging to a fossil species, Regulus bulgaricus, from 2.6-1.95 mya. This appears to be ancestral to the common firecrest, with the goldcrest diverging from this lineage in the Middle Pleistocene.  Distribution and habitat  Cork woodland is favoured for breeding. The common firecrest breeds in lowland broadleaf forest, preferring cork oak and alder where available, otherwise beech and holly. It also uses mixed broadleaf and conifer woodland, and stands of spruce, European silver fir, cedar and pines, often with undergrowth of juniper, ivy and wild rose. In drier Mediterranean habitats it is found in conifers, evergreen oak, and mixed woodlands up to . Unlike more specialised birds such as Eurasian nuthatch and common treecreeper, both of which forage on trunks, the crests do not need large woodlands, and their population density is independent of forest size. In winter it is less reliant on conifers than the goldcrest, moving from forest to fringes and scrub. It occurs singly or in pairs, spending much time in the tree canopy, although frequently venturing into bushes and other lower vegetation. This species can thrive in fairly urban areas, provided that suitable habitat is available in parks or large gardens; population densities in gardens can be comparable with the maximum levels found in natural habitats. The nominate subspecies breeds in Europe from southern England, France, Spain and Portugal east to Belarus, northwestern Ukraine, and Greece, and north to the Baltic and southern Latvia. There are isolated populations east of the main range in Abkhazia, the Crimea and Turkey. Its range lies between the July isotherms. Southern birds are largely resident, unlike northern and eastern populations which are migratory, wintering mainly in Mediterranean areas and the far west of Europe from Portugal north to Britain. R. i. balearicus is resident in the Balearic Islands and the northern parts of Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. This species has been recorded as a vagrant from Norway, Finland, Estonia, Cyprus, Egypt and Lebanon. In July 2020, it was reported that the common firecrest was now nesting in at least two locations in southern Finland.  Behaviour and ecology = Breeding = Galicia, Spain Eggs of Regulus ignicapilla ‚Äì MHNT The common firecrest is monogamous. The male sings during the breeding season, often with its crest raised, and has a display which involves pointing its bill at another bird, showing the crest and strong face pattern. This differs from the display of the plainer-faced goldcrest, which bows its head to emphasise the crest. The breeding territory is about , and may overlap with neighbouring goldcrest territories. Firecrests will sometimes defend their territories against goldcrests with the crest raised and a great deal of wing- fluttering, but the amount of actual competition between the species may not be very great. A Spanish study suggested that territorial conflicts between the species, and other phenomena like males singing mixed or alternating songs, were most frequent when one species locally far outnumbered the other; in other circumstances, the two kinglets learned to ignore each other's songs. In his courtship display the male firecrest raises his crest, points it towards his mate and hovers over her before mating takes place. The nest is often suspended from a hanging branch usually at no great altitude, although Eric Simms reported nests at heights from . Firecrests may favour breeding close to northern goshawk nests. That large bird will prey on potential predators of the firecrest such as Eurasian sparrowhawks, and nest robbers like grey squirrels, Eurasian jays and great spotted woodpeckers. As is typical for the family, the nest is a closed cup built in three layers with a small entrance hole near its top. The nest's outer layer is made from moss, small twigs, cobwebs and lichen, the spider webs also being used to attach the nest to the thin branches that support it. The middle layer is moss, and this is lined with feathers (up to 3,000) and hair. The nest is smaller, deeper and more compact than that of the goldcrest, about across and deep, with a wall thickness of about . The nest is constructed by the female alone, although the male will accompany the female while she builds the nest over a period of a few days to three weeks. Laying starts in western Europe at the end of April, and in the east of the range in late May; second clutches, which are common, commence in June to July. The eggs are pink with very indistinct reddish markings at the broad end, unlike those of Madeira firecrest which are described as like those of a Phylloscopus warbler (white with some brown speckles). The eggs are and weigh , of which 5% is shell. The clutch size in Europe is 7‚Äì12 eggs, but probably smaller in northwest Africa. The female incubates the eggs for 14.5 to 16.5 days to hatching, and broods the chicks, which fledge eight to ten days later. Both parents feed the chicks and fledged young. This species becomes sexually mature after one year, and has a life expectancy of less than two years. Although their ranges overlap substantially, hybridisation between goldcrests and firecrests seems to be prevented by differences in courtship rituals and different facial patterns. Even in aviary studies in which a female goldcrest was given an artificial eyestripe to facilitate mating with a male firecrest, the chicks were never raised by the mixed pair, and appeared to be poorly adapted compared to the parent species. = Feeding = Firecrest parents mainly feed young chicks during their first four days of life with springtails (average length 4 mm) after which time larger food items are given as the chicks grow. All species of kinglet are almost exclusively insectivorous, preying on small arthropods with soft cuticles, such as springtails, aphids and spiders. They also feed on the cocoons and eggs of spiders and insects, and occasionally take pollen. All species will hover to catch flying insects. Although the similarly sized firecrest and goldcrest are often found together, there are a number of factors that reduce direct competition for food. Common firecrests prefer larger prey than goldcrests. Although both will take trapped insects from spider webs on autumn migration, firecrests will also eat the large orb-web spiders (on rare occasions kinglets have been found stuck in a spider web, either unable to move or dead). The common firecrest feeds in trees, exploiting mainly the upper surface of branches in coniferous habitat and of leaves in deciduous trees. This is in contrast to the goldcrest, which frequently feeds on the undersides of branches and leaves. In winter, flocks of common firecrests cover a given distance about three times faster than do goldcrests, and ignore the smallest prey items preferred by their relative; large invertebrates are killed by beating them repeatedly against a branch. The differences in behaviour are facilitated by subtle morphological differences; firecrests have broader bills with longer rictal bristles (which protect a bird's eye from food items it is trying to capture), and these features reflect the larger prey taken by the species. The firecrest's less forked tail may reflect its longer episodes of hovering while hunting. Firecrests forage more often while standing, and have a foot better adapted for perching, whereas the goldcrest's longer hind toe reflects its habit of moving vertically along branches while feeding. It also has a deep grooves in the soles of its feet capable of gripping individual needles, while firecrests have a smoother underside to the foot. Young common firecrests are fed almost exclusively with springtails; larger food items are not accepted, and spiders are occasionally regurgitated. From the fifth day onwards, the nestling diet includes aphids and a high amount of snail shells, the latter being needed for bone growth. After the second week, the food includes larger moths and caterpillars, as well as various arthropods typically avoided by adults, such as harvestmen, earwigs, and centipedes. In winter, the firecrest joins loose flocks of other wanderers such as tits and warblers. This kinglet, like other species that prefer mixed-species foraging flocks in winter, hunts over a greater range of heights and vegetation types than when feeding alone. For species that tend to feed in flocks, foraging success while in a flock was about twice that for solitary birds. In some areas, wintering birds have developed the habit of coming to feeding stations and bird tables for fatty food, sometimes with goldcrests or warblers such as the common chiffchaff and blackcap. The kinglet's digestive system is adapted to an entirely insectivorous diet, whereas Sylvia warblers include fruit in their autumn diet. A Spanish study compared that genus with the insectivorous firecrest and Phylloscopus warblers. The results showed that, relative to body weight, the insect-eaters had shorter intestines, but longer gut passage times than the Sylvia species. The insect-eaters are also generally slightly smaller than the omnivores. = Voice = The contact call is three or four thin high notes, similar to that of goldcrest, but slightly lower in pitch, zit-zit-zit rather than see-see-see. The song is a succession of call notes in a longer and slightly more varied sequence. Typically there are 11‚Äì14 notes per song, becoming louder and faster, with the final three notes slightly different from the preceding ones: zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zirt.zirt.zirt. The song usually lasts 0.5‚Äì2.5 seconds, shorter than the 3.5‚Äì4.0 seconds for the goldcrest, and may be repeated up to eight times a minute. In May and June, singing is most frequent after dawn, but continues less often throughout the day. Later in the breeding season, song becomes largely confined to the morning. The song of the Mediterranean subspecies of common firecrest, R. i. balearicus, is very similar to that of the nominate form, but one factor in separating the Madeiran firecrest from common firecrest is that the island bird's song is divided into three phrases, two of them consisting of modified display and anger calls. Its display calls also use a larger frequency range and more harmonics than those of the continental subspecies. Male goldcrests and Madeiran firecrests sometimes show a territorial response to recordings of the songs or calls of the common firecrest, but the reverse is apparently not true, because the songs of the common firecrest are simpler in construction than those of its relatives. = Predators and parasites = The Eurasian sparrowhawk is a major predator of small songbirds. Throughout the firecrest's range, the main predator of small woodland birds is the Eurasian sparrowhawk, which takes avian prey as up to 98% of its diet. The tawny owl relies more on mammalian catches, but about one-third of its food is forest birds. Eggs and young may be taken by grey squirrels, Eurasian jays and great spotted woodpeckers. The firecrest appears to be virtually unknown as a host of the common cuckoo, a widespread European brood parasite. The invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) is common in the Mediterranean area, and reduces arthropod numbers by removing most native ant species. The reduction in prey items is greatest in the tree canopy, and has a greater effect on species like the firecrest that feed high in the foliage. Less food is available for chicks, and parents have to spend more time foraging. Data on specific parasites of the firecrest is lacking, but the widespread moorhen flea, Dasypsyllus gallinulae has been recorded in a related Regulus species. A number of feather mites have been recorded in the genus, including Proctophyllodes glandarinus on firecrest. These mites live on fungi growing on the feathers. Retrieved 22 October 2010 The fungi found on the plumage may feed on the keratin of the outer feathers or on feather oil.  Status  The common firecrest expanded its range in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, colonising northern France, followed by first breeding in the Netherlands in 1928 and Denmark in 1961. In Britain, it had only been recorded a handful of times by 1839, but first bred in 1962, and is now widespread as a breeding bird in much of southern England. Milder winters have meant that more birds can winter further north, and therefore the breeding range can expand without incurring the risks involved in lengthy migrations.Fiedler, Wolfgang (2003) \\"Recent changes in migratory behaviour of birds: a compilation of field observations and ringing data\\" pp. 21-29 in A population was found in northern Morocco in 1986. Population growth may be limited by lack of suitable habitat, and there may be local declines due to loss of conifers through storms or replacement by plantations of native deciduous trees. There may also be localised losses in areas of high heavy metal pollution, which particularly affects ground feeders like thrushes and conifer foliage gleaners, including both European Regulus species. Conifer specialists suffer from the loss and poor quality of needles, and the consequent decrease in abundance of their invertebrate food. The common firecrest has a large range and a population estimated at 10‚Äì30 million individuals, most in Europe. The population is believed to be stable in the absence of evidence for any declines or serious threats, and it is therefore classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.  In culture  Aristotle and Pliny relate the legend of a contest amongst the birds to see who should be their king, the title to be awarded to the one that could fly highest. Initially, it looked as though the eagle would win easily, but as he began to tire, a small bird which had hidden under the eagle's tail feathers emerged to fly even higher and claimed the title.Aristotle, History of Animals, 9.11.Pliny, Natural History, 10.74 Following from this legend, in much European folklore the wren has been described as the \\"king of the birds\\" or as a flame bearer. However, these terms were also applied to the Regulus species, the fiery crowns of the goldcrest and firecrest making them more likely to be the original bearers of these titles, and, because of the legend's reference to the \\"smallest of birds\\" becoming king, the title was probably transferred to the equally tiny wren.

(Based on a USGS image) The exposed geology of the Yosemite area includes primarily granitic rocks with some older metamorphic rock. The first rocks were laid down in Precambrian times, when the area around Yosemite National Park was on the edge of a very young North American continent. The sediment that formed the area first settled in the waters of a shallow sea, and compressive forces from a subduction zone in the mid-Paleozoic fused the seabed rocks and sediments, appending them to the continent. Heat generated from the subduction created island arcs of volcanoes that were also thrust into the area of the park. In time, the igneous and sedimentary rocks of the area were later heavily metamorphosed. Most of the rock now exposed in the park is granitic, having been formed 210 to 80 million years ago as igneous diapirs 6 miles (10 km) below the surface. Over time, most of the overlying rock was uplifted along with the rest of the Sierra Nevada and was removed from the area by erosion. This exposed the granitic rock to much lower pressure, and it was also subjected to erosion in the forms of exfoliation and mass wasting. Starting about 3 million years ago a series of glaciations further modified the area by accelerating the erosion. During that time large glaciers periodically filled the valleys and canyons. Landslides and river erosion have been the primary erosive forces since the end of the last glacial period, which ended in this area around 12,000 years BP. Formation of exposed rocks =Passive to active margin= The area of the park was astride a passive continental margin (similar to the east coast of present-day United States) during the Precambrian and early Paleozoic. Sediment derived from continental sources was deposited in shallow water. The limestones, sandstones, and shales thus created have since been metamorphosed into marble, quartzite, and slate. These rocks are now exposed on isolated pendants in the northern and central parts of the park (Snow Lake Pendant in the Emigrant Wilderness is a good example). Starting in the mid-Paleozoic and lasting into the early Mesozoic, a convergent plate boundary transported many of those seabed sediments into the area of the park (possibly during the Antler orogeny). Heat generated from the subduction led to the creation of an island arc of volcanoes on the west coast of Laurentia (proto-North America) between the late Devonian and Permian periods. These rocks were incorporated into proto-North America by the middle of the Triassic, some of them finding their way to the area of the park. Most of these igneous and sedimentary rocks have since been heavily metamorphosed, uplifted and eroded away. Outcrops of the resulting Shoo Fly Complex (made of schists and gneisses) and younger Calaveras Complex (a m√©lange of shale, siltstone, and chert with mafic inclusions) are now found in the western side of the park. Later volcanism in the Jurassic intruded and covered these rocks in what may have been magmatic activity associated with the early stages of the creation of the Sierra Nevada Batholith. 95% of these rocks were eventually removed by uplifted-accelerated erosion. Most of the remaining rocks are exposed as 'roof pendants' in the eastern metamorphic zone. Mount Dana and Mount Gibbs are made of these metavolcanic rocks. Only 5% of the rocks exposed in Yosemite National Park are metamorphic. =Pluton emplacement= The first phase of regional plutonism started 210 million years ago in the late Triassic and continued throughout the Jurassic to about 150 million years BP. Also starting 150 million years ago was an increase in the westward drift rate of the North American Plate. The resulting orogeny (mountain-building event) is called the Nevadan orogeny by geologists. The resulting Nevadan mountain range (also called the Ancestral Sierra Nevada) was 15,000 feet (4500 m) high and was made of sections of seafloor and m√©lange. These rocks were later metamorphosed and today can be seen in the gold-bearing metamorphic belt of California's Mother Lode country. In the area of the park these rocks are exposed along the Merced River and State Route 140. This was directly part of the creation of the Sierra Nevada Batholith, and the resulting rocks were mostly granitic in composition and emplaced about 6 miles (10 km) below the surface. The second, major pluton emplacement phase lasted from about 120 million to 80 million years ago during the Cretaceous. This was part of the Sevier orogeny. All told there have been more than 50 plutons found in the park. A few miles (several km) of material was eroded away, leaving the Nevadan mountains as a long series of hills a few hundred feet (tens of meters) high by 25 million years ago. Cenozoic activity =Volcanism= Starting 20 million years ago and lasting until 5 million years ago a now-extinct extension of Cascade Range volcanoes erupted, bringing large amounts of igneous material in the area. These igneous deposits blanketed the region north of the Yosemite area. Some lava associated with this activity poured into the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne and formed Little Devils Postpile (a smaller but much older version of the columnar basalt palisades in nearby Devils Postpile National Monument). In the late Cenozoic, extensive volcanism occurred east of the park area. Within the Yosemite region, andesitic lava flows and lahars flowed north of the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne and volcanic dikes and plugs developed from faults on the flanks of Mount Dana. There is also evidence for a great deal of rhyolitic ash covering the northern part of the Yosemite region 30 million years ago. This and later ash deposits have been almost completely eroded away (especially during the ice ages). Volcanic activity persisted past 5 million years BP east of the current park borders in the Mono Lake and Long Valley areas. The most significant activity was the creation of the Long Valley Caldera about 700,000 years ago in which about 600 times as much material was erupted than in the 1980 eruption of Mt. Saint Helens. The most recent activity was the eruption of the Mono-Inyo Craters from 40,000 to 600 years ago. =Uplift and erosion= Half Dome rises more than above the valley floor. 10 million years ago, vertical movement along the Sierra fault started to uplift the Sierra Nevada. Subsequent tilting of the Sierra block and the resulting accelerated uplift of the Sierra Nevada increased the gradient of western-flowing streams. The streams consequently ran faster and thus cut their valleys more quickly. Tributary streams ran more-or-less in line with the Sierras, therefore not having their gradients increased. Thus their rate of valley cutting was not significantly affected. The results were hanging valleys and cascading waterfalls where the tributaries met the main streams. Additional uplift occurred when major faults developed to the east, especially the creation of Owens Valley from Basin and Range-associated extensional forces. Uplift of the Sierra accelerated again about two million years ago during the Pleistocene. However, Yosemite valley was not created by streams or fault lines (to create a graben valley), such was suggested by geologist Josiah Whitney. Glaciers shaped the Yosemite Valley, and can easily be confused with a graben valley. (Example of a graben valley is Death Valley in California) The uplifting and increased erosion exposed granitic rocks in the area to surface pressures, resulting in exfoliation (responsible for the rounded shape of the many granite domes in the park) and mass wasting following the numerous fracture joint planes (cracks; especially vertical ones) in the now solidified plutons. Pleistocene glaciers further accelerated this process and the larger ones transported the resulting talus and till from valley floors. Numerous vertical joint planes controlled where and how fast erosion took place. Most of these long, linear and very deep cracks trend northeast or northwest and form parallel, often regularly spaced sets. They were created by uplift-associated pressure release and by the unloading of overlying rock via erosion. The great majority of Yosemite Valley's widening, for example, was due to joint- controlled rockfall. In fact, only 10% of its widening and 12% of its excavation are thought to be the result of glaciation. Large, relatively unjointed volumes of granite form domes such as Half Dome and monoliths like the high El Capitan. Closely spaced joints lead to the creation of columns, pillers, and pinnacles such as Washington Column, Cathedral Spires, and Split Pinnacle. =Glaciations= The valley from an airplane Starting about 2 to 3 million years ago a series of glaciations further modified the area by accelerating mass wasting through ice-wedging, glacial plucking, scouring/abrasion and the release of pressure after the retreat of each glaciation. Severe glaciations formed very large glaciers that tended to strip and transport top soil and talus piles far down glacial valleys, while less- severe glaciations deposited a great deal of glacial till further up in the valleys. At least 4 major glaciations have occurred in the Sierra Nevada; locally called the Sherwin (also called the pre-Tahoe), Tahoe, Tenaya, and Tioga. The Sherwin glaciers were the largest, filling Yosemite and other valleys, while later stages produced much smaller glaciers. The Sherwin may have lasted almost 300 thousand years and ended about 1 million years ago. A Sherwin-age glacier was almost surely responsible for the major excavation and shaping of Yosemite Valley and other canyons in the area. The Tahoe, Tenaya, and Tioga stages were part of the Wisconsinan glaciation. The Tahoe glacial stage is thought to have reached its maximum extent around 70,000 to 130,000 years ago; little is known about the more recent Tenaya. Evidence also suggests that the most recent local glacial stage, the Tioga, started about 28,000 cal (calibrated Radiocarbon dating) years ago, reached its maximum extent 20,000 to 25,000 cal yr ago, and ended by ~15,000 cal yr ago. Glaciers reformed in the highest cirques during a minor late-glacial readvance, the Recess Peak event, between about 14,200 and 13,100 yr ago. After that, glaciers appear to have been absent from the range until about 3200 cal yr ago, when small glaciers reappeared in the highest cirques. This readvance records the onset of Neoglaciation in the Sierra Nevada. Neoglaciation in the range culminated during the \\"Little Ice Age,\\" a term originally coined by Fran√ßois E. Matthes in the Sierra Nevada, but now widely accepted as referring to a period of global glacial expansion between about AD 1250 to 1900. Moraines in the Sierra Nevada related to the Little Ice Age event are termed Matthes deposits. They are common in north-facing cirques and below modern glaciers in the High Sierra and are typically fresh, unstable, and often ice- cored. Good examples of Matthes moraines can be found below the Palisade Glacier (the largest glacier in the range), Lyell and Maclure glaciers in southern Yosemite N.P., and the smaller glaciers below Mount Dana, Kuna Peak, Mount Conness, and Matterhorn Peak. Animation: Retreating glaciers feed Lake Yosemite and open today's valley Glacial systems reached depths of up to 4000 feet (1200 m) and left their marks in the Yosemite area. The longest glacier in the Yosemite area ran down the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne River for 60 miles (95 km), passing well beyond Hetch Hetchy Valley. Merced Glacier flowed out of Yosemite Valley and into the Merced River Gorge. Lee Vining Glacier carved Lee Vining Canyon and emptied into Lake Russell (the much enlarged ice age version of Mono Lake). Only the highest peaks, such as Mount Dana and Mount Conness, were not covered by glaciers. Retreating glaciers often left recessional moraines that impounded lakes such as Lake Yosemite (a shallow lake that periodically covered much of the floor of Yosemite Valley). Some domes in the park were covered by glaciers and modified into roche moutonn√©es, which are characterized by having a smooth, rounded side and a steep face. The rounded side was where the glacier flowed over the dome and the steep side is where the glacier flowed away from it. The steepness is caused by glacial plucking of rock along fracture joints. Good examples in the park are Liberty Cap, Lembert Dome, and Mount Broderick. Half Dome was created by a different process, but erosion acting on jointing planes was still the major factor. Controversy The origin of the geological landscapes of the park have been under debate since 1865. At that time, Josiah Whitney, then chief geologist of California, proposed that Yosemite Valley is a graben: a downdropped block of land surrounded by faults. John Muir proposed that Yosemite Valley and Hetch Hetchy Valley were formed purely by glacial action. In 1930, Fran√ßois E. Matthes proposed a hybrid hypothesis, where most of the depth of the valley was gouged by water erosion, the rest by glacial action. The glacial action also claimed to have widened the valley. More recently, the debate has been reopened by Jeffrey Schaffer, who suggests that the role of glaciers and other erosion processes has been dramatically overstated. Schaffer states that Yosemite Valley above 5600 feet (1700 m), for example, has changed relatively little in the past 30 million years. Other than being slightly larger, if one could look back in time and see them, the major features would be recognizable to the modern eye. Schaffer believes that the numerous joint planes have had the greatest impact on the geomorphology of the Park's major features. This is in contradiction to the consensus view that huge highly abrasive glaciers acting on joint planes combined with a great deal of uplift over just the past couple million years was the primary shaping force of the features (such rapid uplift would have greatly accelerated all types of erosion).

The genus name Aegithalos was a term used by Aristotle for some European tits, including the long-tailed tit. Taxonomy and systematics The long-tailed tit was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Parus caudatus. The specific epithet caudatus is the Latin word for \\"tailed\\". Linnaeus did not invent this Latin name. \\"Parus caudatus\\" had been used by earlier authors such as the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in 1555, the Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi in 1599, and the English ornithologist Francis Willughby in 1676. Willughby listed the English name as the \\"long tail'd titmouse\\". The long-tailed tit was first classified as a true tit of the Parus group. Parus has since been split from the Aegithalidae, with the latter becoming a distinct family containing three genera: * Aegithalos (long-tailed tits), five species including A. caudatus * Psaltria (pygmy bushtit), monotypic * Psaltriparus (American bushtit), monotypic. This is the only representative of the Aegithalidae in northern Eurasia. The long-tailed tit exhibits complex global variation with 17 races recognised, divisible into three groups:Harrap, S. and Quinn, D. (1996) Helm Identification Guides: Tits, Nuthatches & Treecreepers. Helm Identification Guides.1 ed. London, Christopher Helm (A&C; Black) Aegithalos caudatus caudatus with white head in Berlin *the caudatus group in northern Europe and Asia. Aegithalos caudatus caudatus has a pure white head *the europaeus group in southern and western Europe, north-east China, and Japan. Separating rosaceus from other members of the europaeus group though is problematic, relying on varying thickness of the crown stripes and amount of streaks and colour on the underparts *the alpinus group in Mediterranean Europe and south-west Asia. The silver-throated bushtit (Aegithalos glaucogularis) from eastern China was formerly considered conspecific but the plumage is distinctive and there are significant genetic differences. Where the groups meet there are extensive areas occupied by very variable ‚Äòhybrids‚Äô. The British long-tailed tit, subspecies rosaceus, belongs to the europaeus group. Description This species has been described as a tiny (at only 13-15 cm in length, including its 7-9 cm tail), round-bodied tit with a short, stubby bill and a very long, narrow tail. The sexes look the same and young birds undergo a complete moult to adult plumage before the first winter. The plumage is mainly black and white, with variable amounts of grey and pink. =Voice= Vocalisations are a valuable aid to locating and identifying these birds. When in flocks they issue constant contact calls and are often heard before they are seen. They have three main calls, a single high pitched ‚Äòpit‚Äô, a ‚Äòtriple trill‚Äô eez-eez-eez, and a rattling ‚Äòschnuur‚Äô. The calls become faster and louder when the birds cross open ground or if an individual becomes separated from the group.

It inhabits deciduous and mixed woodland with a well-developed shrub layer, favouring edge habitats. It can also be found in scrub, heathland with scattered trees, bushes and hedges, in farmland and riverine woodland, parks and gardens. The bird's year-round diet of insects and social foraging bias habitat choice in winter towards deciduous woodland, typically of oak, ash and locally sycamore species. For nesting, strong preference is shown towards scrub areas. The nest is often built in thorny bushes less than 3 metres above the ground. Behaviour and ecology =Food and feeding= The long-tailed tit is insectivorous throughout the year. It eats predominantly arthropods, preferring the eggs and larvae of moths and butterflies. Occasional vegetable matter is taken in the autumn. =Nest= The nest of the long-tailed tit is constructed from four materials - lichen, feathers, spider egg cocoons and moss, with over 6,000 pieces used for a typical nest. The nest is a flexible sac with a small, round entrance on top, suspended either low in a gorse or bramble bush or high up in the forks of tree branches. The structural stability of the nest is provided by a mesh of moss and spider silk. The tiny leaves of the moss act as hooks and the spider silk of egg cocoons provides the loops; thus forming a natural form of velcro. The tit lines the outside with hundreds of flakes of pale lichens - this provides camouflage. Inside, it lines the nest with more than 2,000 downy feathers to insulate the nest. Nests suffer a high rate of predation with only 17% success. File:Long-tailed Tit nest building Dungeness, Kent 07 Mar 2009 A.jpgA long-tailed tit in its nest. File:Aegithalos caudatus MWNH 2283.JPGEgg, Collection Museum Wiesbaden =Social behaviour= H. E. Howard (1920), Territory in Bird Life, p. 145) Long-tailed tits resting, mid-afternoon in energy saving anti-parallel paired formation in a willow Extensive work has been done by at Wytham Wood, Oxfordshire, in Germany and Japan. Outside the breeding season they form compact flocks of six to 17 birds, composed of family parties (parents and offspring) from the previous breeding season, together with any extra adults that helped to raise a brood. These flocks will occupy and defend territories against neighbouring flocks. The driving force behind the flocking behaviour is thought to be that of winter roosting, being susceptible to cold; huddling increases survival through cold nights. From July to February, the non- breeding season, long-tailed tits form flocks of relatives and non-relatives, roosting communally. When the breeding season begins, the flocks break up, and the birds attempt to breed in monogamous pairs. Males remain within the winter territory, while females have a tendency to wander to neighbouring territories. Pairs whose nests fail have three choices: try again, abandon nesting for the season or help at a neighbouring nest. It has been shown that failed pairs split and help at the nests of male relatives, recognition being established vocally. The helped nests have greater success due to higher provisioning rates and better nest defence. At the end of the breeding season, in June‚ÄìJuly, the birds reform the winter flocks in their winter territory. =Helpers= Due to high predation, there is a high nest failure rate. If nest failure occurs after the beginning of May, failed breeders will not try to re-nest, but may become helpers at a nest of another, usually related, pair. In one study, around 50% of nests had one or more helpers. By helping close relatives, helpers gain indirect fitness benefits by increasing the survivability of related offspring. Helpers may also gain greater access to mates and territories in the future. Helpers also gain experience raising young and therefore their future offspring have greater survivability rates. Males and females are equally likely to become helpers. Parents may allow the care of helpers to be additive to their own efforts, or on the other extreme, they may reduce their efforts with the care of the helpers. Juvenile males have a higher survivability than juvenile females, although the survival rate for adults of the two sexes is the same. Offspring that were raised with helpers have a higher survivability than offspring raised without. Failed breeders that became helpers have a higher survivability than failed breeders who did not. This may be because of the reduced energy expenditure from sharing a nest. This is similar to acorn woodpeckers and green wood hoopoes. However, failed breeders that did not help are more likely to breed successfully in subsequent years, so there may be a cost of helping. This may be due to helpers having relatively poorer body conditions at the end of the breeding season, similar to pied kingfisher and white-winged chough. Successful breeders have a survivability rate around the survivability of failed breeders who became helpers. Status and conservation Globally, the species is common throughout its range, only becoming scarce at the edge of the distribution. The IUCN, BirdLife International and The British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) all list the long-tailed tit as a ‚Äòspecies of least concern‚Äô, currently under little or no threat and reasonably abundant. Due to their small size they are vulnerable to extreme cold weather with population losses of up to 80% being recorded in times of prolonged cold. It is thought that populations rapidly return to previous levels due to high breeding potential References Sources * External links * Xeno-canto: audio recordings of the long-tailed tit * Long-tailed tit videos, photos & sounds on the Internet Bird Collection * Calls of several long-tailed tits‚Äîa British Library sound recording. * \\"Ageing and sexing\\" (PDF; 1.48 MB) by Javier Blasco-Zumeta & Gerd-Michael Heinze long-tailed tit long-tailed tit Category:Birds of Europe Category:Birds of Japan Category:Birds of Korea Category:Birds of Russia Category:Birds of Western Asia Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Long-tailed tit"},{"id":"334346","text":"Faxian (337 ‚Äì c. 422) was a Chinese Buddhist monk and translator who traveled by foot from China to India, visiting sacred Buddhist sites in Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia between 399-412 to acquire Buddhist texts.

He visited India in the early fifth century. He is said to have walked all the way from China across the icy desert and rugged mountain passes. He entered India from the northwest and reached Pataliputra. He took back with him Buddhist texts and images sacred to Buddhism. He saw the ruins of the city when he reached Pataliputra. Faxian's visit to India occurred during the reign of Chandragupta II. He is also renowned for his pilgrimage to Lumbini, the birthplace of Gautama Buddha (modern Nepal). However, he mentioned nothing about Guptas. Faxian claimed that demons and dragons were the original inhabitants of Sri Lanka.(Original from the University of Michigan) On Faxian's way back to China, after a two-year stay in Ceylon, a violent storm drove his ship onto an island, probably Java.Buswell, Robert E., Lopez, Donald S.

He spent the rest of his life translating and editing the scriptures he had collected. Faxian wrote a book on his travels, filled with accounts of early Buddhism, and the geography and history of numerous countries along the Silk Road as they were, at the turn of the 5th century CE. He wrote about cities like Taxila, Patliputra, Mathura, and Kannauj in Middle India. He also wrote that inhabitants of Middle India also eat and dress like Chinese people. He declared Patliputra as a very prosperous city. He returned in 412 and settled in what is now Nanjing. In 414 he wrote (or dictated) Foguoji (A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms; also known as Faxian's Account).

It is the only extant member of the genus Spirula, the family Spirulidae, and the order Spirulida. Because of the shape of its internal shell, it is commonly known as the ram's horn squidNorman, M. 2000. Cephalopods: A World Guide. Hackenheim, ConchBooks. or the little post horn squid. Because the live animal has a light-emitting organ, it is also sometimes known as the tail-light squid. Live specimens of this cephalopod are very rarely seen because it is a deep-ocean dweller. The small internal shell of the species is, however, quite a familiar object to many beachcombers. The shell of Spirula is extremely light in weight, very buoyant, and surprisingly durable; it very commonly floats ashore onto tropical beaches (and sometimes even temperate beaches) all over the world. This seashell is known to shell collectors as the ram's horn shell or simply as Spirula.  Description  S. spirula has a squid-like body between 35 mm and 45 mm long. It is a decapod, with eight arms and two longer tentacles, all with suckers. The arms and tentacles can all be withdrawn completely into the mantle. The species lacks a radula (or, at most, has a vestigial radula). Illustration of live animal =Shell= The most distinctive feature of this species is its buoyancy organ, an internal, chambered, endogastrically coiled shell in the shape of an open planispiral (a flat spiral wherein the coils do not touch each other), and consisting of two prismatic layers. The shell functions to osmotically control buoyancy; the gas-filled chambers keep the spirula in a vertical, head-down attitude. Another trait is that it is mineralized, a feature only seen in cuttlefish and the nautilus amongst extant species. The siphuncle is marginal, on the inner surface of the spiral.  Behaviour  End of mantle showing the photophore S. spirula is capable of emitting a green light from a photophore located at the tip of its mantle, between the ear-shaped fins.  Habitat and distribution  Oral view of the left tentacular club By day, Spirula lives in the deep oceans, reaching depths of 1,000 m. At night, it rises to 100‚Äì300 m. Its preferred temperature is around 10 ¬∞C, and it tends to live around oceanic islands, near the continental shelf. Most sources cite this species as tropical, and they are observed to be plentiful in the subtropical seas around the Canary Islands. Shells are regularly found along the western coasts of South Africa. However, significant quantities of shells from dead spirula are washed ashore even in temperate regions, such as coasts of New Zealand. Because of the great buoyancy of the shells, these may possibly have been carried long distances by ocean currents. Much of the organism's life history has not been observed; for instance, they are thought to spawn in winter in deeper water, yet no spawnlings have been directly seen. They must occasionally venture into the upper 10 m of the sea, for they are sometimes found in albatross guts. Evolutionary relationships The order Spirulida also contains two extinct suborders: Groenlandibelina (including extinct families Groenlandibelidae and Adygeyidae), and Belopterina (including extinct families Belemnoseidae and Belopteridae). Spirula is likely the closest living relative of the extinct belemnites and aulacocerids. These three groups as a unit are closely related to the cuttlefish, as well as to the true squids.

It served as an upper tier of municipal government, aggregating municipal services of region-wide interest like the counties and regional municipalities of Southern Ontario, and was the only upper tier municipal government ever created in Northern Ontario. The regional municipality was dissolved with the creation of the amalgamated city of Greater Sudbury on January 1, 2001. Structure The regional municipality expanded the boundaries of the city of Sudbury to annex the community of Copper Cliff, the unincorporated geographic township of Broder and half of the unincorporated geographic township of Dill. The other half of Dill Township ‚Äî including the community of Wanup ‚Äî remained unincorporated, although it was subsequently annexed into Greater Sudbury in 2001. The existing town of Capreol also expanded its boundaries in 1973 to annex the unincorporated communities of Selwood and Milnet. However, despite its status as part of the Regional Municipality, Statistics Canada did not include the town in Sudbury's Census Metropolitan Area for census purposes. The towns of Nickel Centre, Onaping Falls, Rayside-Balfour, Valley East and Walden were all newly created by the amalgamation of several smaller towns and townships. Valley East, the largest and fastest-growing of the smaller towns, was granted city status in 1997. All of the municipalities were dissolved into the city of Greater Sudbury in 2001. Each town and city in the regional municipality had its own mayor and council, and provided many of its own municipal services. The regional municipality had a regional council and chairman of its own, and provided certain services of region-wide interest, such as the regional road network, policing and social services. One notable fact was that this was the only regional municipality in Ontario not to originate from a former county government; it was created out of the Sudbury District, which still surrounds the current city. Unlike the counties and regional municipalities of Southern Ontario, the more sparsely populated north is divided into unincorporated districts which do not serve as governing bodies. The Regional Municipality of Sudbury was ‚Äî and the current city of Greater Sudbury still is ‚Äî the only census division in Northern Ontario which has the structure and function of a Southern Ontario census division. The regional offices were located at Civic Square, which was also the home of Sudbury's city council. Civic Square was renamed Tom Davies Square in 1997 following the retirement of longtime regional chairman Tom Davies. History In the 1976 municipal election, the first municipal elections held after the creation of the regional municipality, voters in three of the suburban towns rejected the new level of government.\\"Some upsets, a close vote and a no to regional government\\". The Globe and Mail, December 7, 1976. The strongest opposition was in Onaping Falls, with the vote running against regional government by a margin of 20 to one. Despite the opposition, however, none of the towns was released from the regional government structure. =Amalgamation= On January 1, 2001, all of the seven incorporated municipalities, as well as the regional municipality itself, were amalgamated into the united city of Greater Sudbury. The former municipal names remain in informal use to designate the different areas of the city. The name \\"Sudbury\\" itself may be ambiguous, however ‚Äî depending on the context, it may denote either the old city in isolation, or a shorthand name for the entire amalgamated city. In addition to the former towns and cities of the Regional Municipality of Sudbury, the unincorporated townships of Dill, Cleland, Fraleck, Parkin, Aylmer, Mackelcan, Rathbun and Scadding were also annexed into the new city. The townships of Cleland and Dill encompass the communities of Wanup and St. Cloud, while the townships of Fraleck, Parkin, Aylmer, Mackelcan, Rathbun and Scadding comprise a wilderness area on the northeast side of Lake Wanapitei which contains only a few recreational properties. However, the annexation of this latter area into the city resulted in Lake Wanapitei supplanting Ramsey Lake, near downtown Sudbury, as the world's largest lake contained entirely within the boundaries of a single city.

Peter Wong, a former mayor of Sudbury, became the region's first elected chair, but died after just seven months in office.

It then enters Gasconade County near Morrison and bridges the Gasconade River near its mouth at the eponymous town. In the county seat, Hermann, Route 100 has a short concurrency with Route 19. The highway passes through New Haven, in Franklin County, later. The highway then intersects Route 185 at its northern terminus, and Route 47 in Washington. It becomes an expressway outside the city limits, which runs to near Gray Summit. Route 100 crosses over Interstate 44 two times, with an interchange providing access to the freeway. Northeast of Gray Summit, Route 100 crosses into St. Louis County, entering the city limits of Wildwood at the same time. Just north of the intersection with Route T, the highway becomes an expressway again. In Wildwood, it has an interchange with Route 109. Route 100 then enters Ellisville, where the expressway ends. From here all the way into St. Louis, the highway also carries the local name Manchester Road. In Ellisville, Route 340 (Clarkson Road) meets its southern terminus. Route 100 then proceeds into Ballwin. It then divides Manchester from Winchester, Missouri before wholly entering Manchester, where it has a single-point urban interchange (SPUI) with Route 141. Route 100 then runs through a swath of unincorporated territory en route to Des Peres. The route crosses over Interstate 270, the St. Louis beltway, in that town. East of Ellisville, Route 100 enters Kirkwood; there, Manchester Road intersects Kirkwood Road (the name given to Lindbergh Boulevard in Kirkwood), which carries US 61/67. Route 100 then passes through the smaller suburbs of Warson Woods, Glendale, Rock Hill, Brentwood, and Maplewood. After leaving Maplewood, Route 100 continues into the independent City of St. Louis where the name changes from \\"Manchester Road\\" to \\"Manchester Avenue.\\" As Manchester Avenue crosses Vandeventer Avenue, the highway becomes Chouteau Avenue. Route 100 continues east on Chouteau Avenue towards Downtown St. Louis. The route ends just east of South Broadway, at the Interstate 55 overpass. Due to the nearby east terminus of I-44, there is no interchange with I-55 at the state route's terminus. The Lewis and Clark Trail Most of Route 100 is part of the Lewis and Clark Trail. From Kirkwood Rd in Kirkwood to three miles (5 km) west of Wildwood is one section, where the trail turns off on Route T. Route T will eventually end, once again, at Route 100 northwest of I-44 and continue down Route 100 all the way to five miles (8 km) north of Linn (where Route 100 ends), and the Lewis and Clark Trail turns off onto Route C. History Much of the road between St. Louis and Gray Summit was the original U.S. Route 66, though this was only temporary until US 66 moved to its later location at what is now Watson Rd (Route 366) and Interstate 44. During, and after US 66 was moved off Manchester Rd, the road remained part of U.S. Route 50 for many years.

One of the defining features of these lizards is that their tail often curls over. They were previously regarded as members of subfamily Leiocephalinae within the family Tropiduridae. There are presently 29 known species, all in the genus Leiocephalus.  Distribution  The curly-tailed lizards are native to the West Indies, with the extant (living) species in the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, Cayman Islands, Cuba, Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic) and nearby small islands. Additionally, Leiocephalus carinatus and Leiocephalus schreibersii have been introduced to Florida.  General anatomy  The curly-tailed lizards vary in size depending on species, but typically are approximately in snout-to-vent length. These lizards have no femoral pores, pterygoid teeth, or palatine teeth. Additionally, these lizards are observed to have overlapping scales.  Behavior  Curly-tailed lizard in Key West Florida The curly-tailed lizards mostly forage on arthropods like insects, but also commonly take flowers and fruits. Large individuals will eat small vertebrates, including anoles. As suggested by their name, most species of this family often lift their tail and curl it. This is done both when a potential predator is present and when not present, although in some curly- tailed lizard species it increases when one is present. It shows the fitness of the lizard to a would-be predator and‚Äîin the case of an attack‚Äîdraws attention to the tail, which increases the lizard's chance of escaping. Although it has been suggested that it also functions as a territorial display, studies have been unable to find support for this, as the tail curling does not change when another member of the same species is present.  Conservation status  The conservation status of the species in this family varies greatly. Several species, for example Leiocephalus carinatus, are common and widespread. Others are rare and highly threatened, especially those restricted to a single small island or a single location on a larger island, like the critically endangered Leiocephalus (barahonensis) altavelensis from Alto Velo Island and critically endangered Leiocephalus onaneyi from Guant√°namo Province in Cuba. Primary threats to their survival are habitat loss (for example, expanding agriculture, charcoal production and grazing goats) and introduced predators (for example, small Indian mongoose). Several species are already extinct. Some of these are only known from fossil or subfossil remains and became extinct in the Pleistocene or pre-Columbian era, but others survived into recent history. Three species, Leiocephalus endomychus, Leiocephalus pratensis and Leiocephalus rhutidira, have not been seen since the 1960s and 1970s and are recognized as critically endangered, possibly extinct, by the IUCN. They are among the \\"most wanted\\" EDGE species.  Newly discovered species  Lizards of this family are diurnal and mostly inhabit fairly open habitats in a generally well-studied part of the world. Consequently, the majority of the species and subspecies already were scientifically described several decades ago. In 2016, the first new curly- tailed lizard since the early 1980s was described. The species was found in the coastal dunes of Bah√≠a de las Calderas in the southwestern Dominican Republic. This species differs from the rest within Leiocephalidae in that its bony parietal table is U-shaped versus V-shaped, the males have 3-4 enlarged post-postcloacal scales versus 2, and there are specific sexual dimorphism trails.

The resort was founded in 1953 by Dave McCoy and, from 2005 to 2017, was owned by the Starwood Capital Group. In 2017, Mammoth Resorts announced its sale by Starwood to a partnership of Aspen Skiing Company and KSL Capital Partners, later named Alterra Mountain Company. Description The ski area is located on the north side of Mammoth Mountain in the volcanic Long Valley Caldera. Overnight guests stay in the town of Mammoth Lakes, California and occasionally in neighboring towns such as Bishop and June Lake. June Lake's ski area is also owned by Mammoth Mountain Ski Area. The top of the mountain has challenging chutes and groomed as well as mogul runs. There are eight Unbound terrain parks. Unbound Main, adjacent to Main Lodge, is highly praised by extreme snowboarding and skiing enthusiasts, and is one of the major attractions of the ski resort. Mammoth Mountain also has one of the longest ski seasons in North America, which averages from the start of November to Memorial Day. The resort occasionally enjoys a longer season, as in 2016/2017, when it opened on November the 8th and did not close until the August the 6th. The 1994‚Äì95 season was Mammoth Mountain's longest, over ten months, with the resort operating from October 8 until August 13. The 2016-2017 season was the second snowiest on record, with 618 inches (2010-2011 with 668.5 inches is the resort record), and it stayed open until August 6, 2017. January 2017 was the snowiest month in Mammoth history, with 246 inches.

Mammoth Mountain is located in California's Eastern Sierra approximately south of the Nevada state line and 50 minutes from the Eastern Gate of Yosemite National Park. While the ski area is located in central California, it is mainly frequented by skiers and snowboarders from southern California. Although it is a five- hour drive from Los Angeles via U.S. 395, it is much closer for southern California winter sports enthusiasts than the Lake Tahoe area resorts, which are more accessible to the San Francisco Bay Area. Mammoth Mountain is a more popular destination than southern California ski resorts in the San Bernardino and San Gabriel Mountains, because of these areas' heavy reliance on snowmaking, coupled with significantly lighter winter precipitation and their notably shorter seasons. Although Mammoth is physically closer to San Francisco and central valley cities than Los Angeles, most mountain passes along the Sierra crest are closed after the first major snowfall, and this lack of a trans-Sierra travel route creates an unusually long drive to Mammoth (6-8 hours) from the Bay Area and most of central California.

Scheduled passenger service, as of January 2020, is available to Mammoth Yosemite Airport (MMH) near Mammoth Lakes from Los Angeles (LAX) on a year-round basis via United Airlines CRJ700 flights operated by Sky West. United Airlines also offers seasonal nonstop service from San Francisco (SFO) and Denver International Airport (DEN) to Mammoth Lakes. Other seasonal service is provided by scheduled charter on JSX from both Burbank, CA and Orange County, CA - latest flight options can be found at www.VisitMammoth.com/fly History Mammoth was founded by Dave McCoy, a hydrographer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. As a member of the Eastern Sierra Ski Club in the 1930s, McCoy noticed that Mammoth Mountain consistently held more snow than other mountains. The Ski Club had a portable rope tow. McCoy bought the rope tow from the club in 1941 and usually kept it at Mammoth. In 1953, the United States Forest Service awarded a permit to McCoy to operate the ski area, and the first ski lift was built in 1955. =Incidents= As the ski area grew, McCoy faced adverse circumstances: the 1973 oil crisis, an avalanche in 1979 that destroyed a ski lift, and a prolonged drought that led to layoffs in 1991. Similar to other ski resorts, Mammoth had a number of associated fatalities in its history: *In 1973, the resort bought Sierra Pacific Airlines from 3-D film cinematographer Chris Condon. On March 13, 1974, a film crew for Wolper Productions filming a National Geographic history of Australopithecus at the resort was killed when their Convair 440 aircraft (N4819C) flew into a ridge shortly after an evening take-off from Eastern Sierra Regional Airport in Bishop, killing all 35 on board including 31 Wolper crew members‚Äîalthough not Wolper himself. The filmed segment was recovered in the wreckage and was broadcast in the television show Primal Man. The National Transportation Safety Board was unable to determine the cause of the accident, and the resort sold the airline. Sierra Pacific previously operated scheduled passenger flights with turboprop aircraft between Mammoth Lakes and Burbank, Fresno, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. *On April 6, 2006, three ski patrollers at the ski area perished due to a combination of CO2 and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) poisoning. Both gases are present on a known dangerous fumarole on the mountain and were more concentrated on that day because the fumarole had been covered by snow for days. Four patrollers, including John \\"Scott\\" McAndrews and James Juarez, were raising the fence around the fumarole, which had become buried due to heavy snowfall. The fumarole had melted a cavern below the snowbridge which collapsed under James and Scott. The pair of men fell and perished within a matter of minutes. Another ski patroller, Walt Rosenthal, perished and seven others were injured trying to rescue James and Scott. The oxygen masks used by the Mammoth Mountain ski patrol did not completely seal outer gases from coming in. =Sale to Intrawest= The Village at Mammoth as seen from the Village Gondola station in April 2010. In January 1996, Intrawest Corporation and Mammoth Mountain Ski area announced that Intrawest Corporation had purchased 33% of Mammoth and June Mountain ski operations, as well as all of the developable real estate owned by Mammoth Mountain Ski Area. In 1998, Intrawest increased their partnership interest to 58%. The development of three new village areas: The Village at Mammoth, Sierra Star, and Juniper Springs, has brought new developments to the resort. The Village at Mammoth, a European-style and pedestrian-only complex, was built in a style similar to other Intrawest properties, such as Whistler in British Columbia or Keystone in Colorado. The Village opened in 2003 with various stores, restaurants, galleries and 166 luxury condominiums. The 15-passenger Village Gondola, which departs from the Village, transports skiers and snowboarders directly to the Canyon Lodge base. =Sale to Starwood Capital= On February 23, 2005, Dave McCoy announced the pending sale his stake in Mammoth Mountain, after 68 years of running the ski area. On October 5, 2005, Mammoth announced that a majority stake will be sold to Starwood Capital Group, a private equity fund specializing in real estate, run by Barry Sternlicht. The sale price was $365 million. Because of a poor economy in California, beginning in 2007, many of the stores and restaurants in The Village closed. However, in the fall of 2010, with the help of local business owners, the Village has seen a resurgence of new restaurants and stores. =Changes and re-development= The gondola to the summit Hole in the Wall backcountry ski attraction Before and during the changes of ownership, the ski area underwent major changes. The resort went from 16 chairs in the 1980s to 23 today. A new gondola was built that ends at a visitor center at . The visitor center has telescopes and historical displays. Almost all the old, slow, double chair lifts were replaced with high-speed quad, and six-seater lifts, traveling at around 1000 feet per minute. For these modernizations, the resort is a longtime customer to the Doppelmayr group. Several old lifts were also removed. The Mid-Chalet, which once had picnic tables on its roof, was completely remodeled in the early 2000s, renamed McCoy Station, and now features gourmet foods and a cafeteria. Large vintage photos of McCoy and his family can be found hanging from the ceiling there. The Mill Cafe, a small rustic bar and snack area was added in the early 2000s. In 2011, Chair 5 was chosen to be upgraded for the 2011-2012 season. Chair 5 was upgraded from a Yan-fixed three person chair to a Doppelmayr high speed quad. The ride time is reported to be half as long, and the capacity was increased from 1800 an hour to an estimated 2400 people an hour. In line with tradition, the chair was also given a new name: High Five Express. Mammoth Mountain is also the owner of the June Mountain ski area in the small Mono County town of June Lake, California. On June 21, 2012, the CEO of Mammoth Mountain announced that they are closing June Mountain for the 2012-2013 season, after more than 50 years of operations. June Mountain reopened for the 2013-2014 ski season. As of 2018, a zip-line is under construction. Once complete, it will be the steepest in North America. It goes from the top of the mountain near the upper gondola to the bottom near Main Lodge, with a stop near the top of Chair 1. =RFID Lift Pass= The RFID lift pass was implemented for the 2011‚Äì2012 season. It was designed to combat two issues: long lines at the lifts and long lines at the ticket window. A total of 72 RFID gates were installed over 18 different lifts. The RFID lift pass has a circuit in the ticket that sensors to the gates to open when approached. Mascot Mammoth Mountain has a popular mascot named \\"Woolly\\" who can be found skiing around the mountainhttps://www.mammothmountain.com/discover/where's-woolly, taking pictures with guestshttps://www.slopefillers.com/mammoth-mountains-mascot- wooly-returns-interview/, and leading events like a Saturday parade for children.

Phymaturus is the mid-sized genus of its family, with 48 species altogether known as of 2019; new species are still being discovered however.Scolaro et al. (2008). Species of the genus Phymaturus are found in the Andes region south to Patagonia and inhabit a variety of habitats. Their habits are mostly conserved from the ancestral iguanians, in that Phymaturus are generally inhabitants of rocky ground, feed on plants, and give birth to fully developed young. Systematics The genus can be divided into two lineages, which probably represent clades: palluma group :Superciliar scales not imbricate, more than four subocular scales, 3-4 rows of lorilabial scales, mental scale narrower than rostral scale and usually touching the sublabial scales. Tail spines well-developed, two annuli per segment. patagonicus group :Superciliar scales elongate and overlapping, one usually unfragmented subocular scale, tail smooth, Meckel's groove fused and closed.

Habitat Zebra-tailed lizards live in open desert with fairly hard-packed soil, scattered vegetation, and scattered rocks, typically flats, washes, and plains. Description Zebra-tailed lizards range in size from in snout-to-vent length. These lizards are grey to sandy brown, usually with a series of paired dark gray spots down the back, becoming black crossbands on the tail. The underside of the tail is white with black crossbars. Males have a pair of black blotches on their sides, extending to blue patches on their bellies. Females have no blue patches, and the black bars are either faint or completely absent. Callisaurus draconoides: Dorsal (top) and ventral (bottom) views Behavior Zebra-tailed lizards are diurnal and alert. They rise early and are active in all but the hottest weather. During the hottest times of day, lizards may stand alternately on two legs, switching to the opposite two as needed in a kind of dance. When threatened, they run swiftly with their toes curled up and tails raised over their backs, exposing the stripes. When stopped, they wag their curled tails side-to-side to distract predators. They can even run on their hind legs for short distances. In areas of creosote scrub, this lizard reaches its highest population densities, around 4.8 to 6.0 individuals per acre (600 to 800 m¬≤ per lizard). This lizard burrows into fine sandy soil for retreat at night and usually seeks day shelter in the shade of bushes. It is also known to burrow under sand for safety when being chased by predators. Reproduction In summer, zebra-tailed lizards typically lay two to eight eggs, which hatch from July to November, but more than one clutch can be laid during a season. Eggs are laid, presumably, in friable, sandy soil. Being a prey species for many animals, including birds, other lizards, and mammals, they have a fairly high reproductive rate. Diet Lizards of the genus Callisaurus feed on a variety of prey from insects, such as moths, ants and bees, and spiders and other smaller lizards. The diet occasionally includes vegetation, such as spring buds and flowers. Geographic range Zebra-tailed lizards are common and widely distributed throughout the Southwestern United States, ranging from the Mojave and Colorado deserts north into the southern Great Basin. Taxonomy The genus Callisaurus is monotypic, containing only one species, C. draconoides. Nine subspecies are recognized, including the nominotypical subspecies.Callisaurus draconoides The Reptile Database. www.reptile- database.org. *C. d. bogerti ‚Äì Bogert's zebra-tailed lizard *C. d. brevipes ‚Äì short-footed zebra-tailed lizard *C. d. carmenensis ‚Äì Carmen Island zebra- tailed lizard *C. d. crinitus ‚Äì Viscaino zebra-tailed lizard *C. d. draconoides ‚Äì common zebra-tailed lizard *C. d. inusitanus ‚Äì Sonoran zebra- tailed lizard *C. d. myurus ‚Äì Nevada zebra-tailed lizard *C. d. rhodostictus ‚Äì Mojave zebra-tailed lizard *C. d. ventralis ‚Äì eastern zebra-tailed lizard Nota bene: A trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the subspecies was originally described in a genus other than Callisaurus.

Retrieved from http://www.wildearthguardians.org/support_docs/factsheet_earless_lizard_FINAL.pdf Behavior Earless lizards are most active during daylight; they hibernate during the winter and fall. When approached by a predator, their defense mechanism is raising and wagging their tails. To claim their territory, a combination of lateral body compression, head bobbing, and push-ups is done. Earless lizards are capable of homeostasis to a certain extent. As a feedback to temperature change, they acquire heat by conduction, convection, and radiation. In cooler temperatures, they raise their body temperature by turning their bodies broadside to the sun to absorb heat (infrared radiation).Devender, W. (n.d.). Fight For Survival: The Earless Lizard. Retrieved from http://www.wildearthguardians.org/support_docs/factsheet_earless_lizard_FINAL.pdf They can also align their bodies to the sun to reduced absorption to reduce body temperature.

(n.d.). Greater Earless Lizard. Retrieved from https://www.desertusa.com/animals/greater-earless-lizard.html Defense mechanism The earless lizard has a peculiar defense mechanism coupled to its cold-blooded metabolism. It has a small opening on the top of its head called a \\"blood sinus\\", which helps it gain heat quickly during the daytime. However, the blood can also be channeled to the eyes of the lizard when a predator approaches, efficiently spraying http://www.digimorph.org/resources/horned.phtml the blood onto the predator, giving it enough time to escape. Reproduction Mating takes place in spring. Earless lizards lay their eggs between March and August, and about fifty days are needed for them to hatch. They tend to lay one to three clutches of eggs. Clutch sizes range from one to 10 eggs. When hatched, the hatchlings are about 2 in (5 cm) long. Threats No major threat to them has been identified in the US or Mexico, but habitat loss and degradation would result in an decline in the species.‚ÄúCophosaurus Texanus .‚Äù Dromaius Novaehollandiae (Common Emu), www.iucnredlist.org/details/64062/0.

The common names refer directly to their flattened, rounded bodies and blunt snouts. The genus name Phrynosoma means \\"toad-bodied\\". In common with true toads (family Bufonidae), horned lizards tend to move sluggishly, often remain motionless, and rely on their remarkable camouflage to avoid detection by predators. They are adapted to arid or semiarid areas. The spines on the lizard's back and sides are modified reptile scales, which prevent water loss through the skin, whereas the horns on the head are true horns (i.e. they have a bony core). Of the 22 species of horned lizards, 15 are native to the United States. The largest-bodied and most widely distributed of the US species is the Texas horned lizard. Defenses Mexican Plateau horned lizard (Phrynosoma orbiculare) near Xalapa de Enr√≠quez, Veracruz, Mexico, showing blood squirted from eye as defensive behavior (20 April 2011) Horned lizards use a variety of means to avoid predation. Their coloration generally serves as camouflage. When threatened, their first defense is to remain still to avoid detection. If approached too closely, they generally run in short bursts and stop abruptly to confuse the predator's visual acuity. If this fails, they puff up their bodies to cause them to appear more horned and larger, so that they are more difficult to swallow. At least eight species (P. asio, P. cornutum, P. coronatum, P. ditmarsi, P. hernandesi, P. orbiculare, P. solare, and P. taurus) are also able to squirt an aimed stream of blood from the corners of the eyes for a distance up to . They do this by restricting the blood flow leaving the head, thereby increasing blood pressure and rupturing tiny vessels around the eyelids. The blood not only confuses predators, but also tastes foul to canine and feline predators. It appears to have no effect against predatory birds. Only three closely related species (P. mcallii, P. modestum, and P. platyrhinos) are certainly known to be unable to squirt blood. While previous thought held that compounds were added to the blood from glands in the ocular sinus cavity, current research has shown that the chemical compounds that make up the defense are already in the circulating blood. It is possible that their diet of large quantities of venomous harvester ants could be a factor; however, the origin and structure of the chemicals responsible are still unknown. The blood-squirting mechanism increases survival after contact with canine predators; the trait may provide an evolutionary advantage. Ocular autohemorrhaging has also been documented in other lizards, which suggests blood-squirting could have evolved from a less extreme defense in the ancestral branch of the genus. Recent phylogenic research supports this claim, so the species incapable of squirting blood apparently have lost the adaptation for reasons yet unstudied. To avoid being picked up by the head or neck, a horned lizard ducks or elevates its head and orients its cranial horns straight up, or back. If a predator tries to take it by the body, the lizard drives that side of its body down into the ground so the predator cannot easily get its lower jaw underneath. Population decline Horned lizard populations continue to disappear throughout the Southwest despite protective legislation. The Texas horned lizard has disappeared from almost half of its geographic range. Population declines are attributed to loss of habitat, human eradication of the ant populations upon which the lizards prey, displacement of native ant populations by invading fire ants (aided by synergistic effects of native ant eradication), and predation by domestic dogs and cats. In 2014, the Center for Biological Diversity in Tucson petitioned the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation to have the Texas horned lizard put on the endangered species list due to the massive declines of its population in Oklahoma, where it was once plentiful. The center said it may later seek protection for the animal on a federal level; it also said that reptiles in general are dying off at up to 10,000 times their historic extinction rate, greatly due to human influences.
