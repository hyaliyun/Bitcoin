History On 1 September 1966, following Cardiff RFC's 35‚Äì0 defeat of Cardiff & District, a group of supporters came up with idea of forming a choir to improve the standard of after-match singing. The Cardiff Athletic Male Voice Choir first met on the following Monday, 5 September, in the old Skittle Alley at the Rugby Club. There were twenty-five members present for the first meeting.http://www.cardiffarmsparkmalechoir.co.uk The choir changed its name in 2000 to become the Cardiff Arms Park Male Choir, helping to raise the profile of the choir and perpetuate the name of the Arms Park. The choir made their first TV appearance within weeks of being formed, welcoming the Australian Rugby Team to Wales, and has since appeared on television on numerous occasions, including appearances on BBC, Sky Sports, ITV, Channel 4, New Zealand and Australian TV and MUTV. The choir sang live on Grandstand in 2002 and recorded an advertisement for the BBC's Six Nations rugby coverage alongside Goldie Lookin Chain in 2006. The choir were also filmed for an in- flight advertisement for Qantas airlines. They appeared on the Rogue Trader section of Watchdog, made a very brief appearance on Strictly Come Dancing and supported Ant & Dec in a link for Britain's Got Talent. The choir has performed alongside numerous stars, including Hayley Westenra, Charlotte Church, Max Boyce, Peter Karrie, Sh√¢n Cothi, Goldie Lookin Chain and Foreigner. The choir has travelled to Scotland (Blairgowrie in 1993, Perth and Crieff in 2009 and 2011), Ireland (Kilkenny in 1998), the Czech Republic (Prague, Plzen and Karl≈°tejn in 2004), France (Pleyben in 2004 Chatte in 2006 and [(Strasbourg)] in 2012), Switzerland (Le Brassus in 2006), Italy (Milan in 2006), Germany (Heilbronn, Satteldorf and Stuttgart in 2007), Poland (Krak√≥w in 2009) and Spain (Santander in 2010). Some of the choir joined as guests of Dowlais Male Choir in their performances at the 2008 Festival Interceltique de Lorient. In the UK, the choir has performed in a variety of venues, including nine appearances at the London Welsh Festivals of Male Choirs in the Royal Albert Hall, singing before Wales v Fiji in 2002 and Wales v South Africa in 2008 at the Millennium Stadium and numerous appearances at Cardiff Arms Park itself. The choir took part in the World Choir at the National Stadium in Cardiff in 1993. In 2009 the choir sang at the opening of the new Cardiff library. The Manic Street Preachers opened the library, and the choir sang a specially arranged version of their song A Design for Life, which was described by bassist Nicky Wire as \\"spine-tingling\\". The choir sang at the opening of the new John Lewis department store in Cardiff in September 2009 as well as recording their radio advertisement. The choir's involvement was included in a subsequent BBC documentary. Massed Choir Festivals The choir celebrated its fortieth anniversary in 2006 with a number of events, including a dinner at the Arms Park and a European tour. The main event was a massed male concert at St David's Hall, Cardiff on 17 June. The concert featured over 400 singers made up of choristers from Canoldir, Dowlais, Gwent, Kenfig Hill, Maesteg, Neath, Penybontfawr and Pontarddulais male choirs alongside the Cardiff choristers. They were accompanied by a 53-strong orchestra, and the guest artists were the Llanishen Fach Primary School choir and Hayley Westenra. Following on from the success of the massed concert in 2006, the choir joined forces with Canoldir Male Choir (based in Birmingham) to create the AngloWelsh Festival of Male Choirs. The first concerts of the biennial festival took place in April/May 2009 in Symphony Hall, Birmingham and St David's Hall, Cardiff. Participating choirs were Cardiff Arms Park, Canoldir, Dowlais, Kenfig Hill, Kidderminster, Leigh Orpheus, Neath, Shrewsbury, Penybontfawr and Pontypridd male choirs. The guest artists were Les Chansonelles and John Garner in Birmingham, and Llanishen Fach Primary School choir and Sh√¢n Cothi in Cardiff. The second AngloWelsh Festival of Male Choirs took place in St David's Hall, Cardiff on 10 September 2011. The massed choir was made up of Biddulph, Budleigh Salterton, Cardiff Arms Park, Canoldir, Cotswold, Dowlais, Mynyddislwyn, Newtown & District, Pontypridd, Shrewsbury, Tenby and Ynysowen male choirs. Guest artists were the Llanishen Fach Primary School choir and Gary Griffiths.

He flew as an observer/gunner in Bristol F.2 Fighters in 20 Squadron.Franks et.al. (1997), pp.6‚Äì7. Pre-World War I Leslie William Burbidge was the son of Reverend E. O. Burbidge. The younger Burbidge worked for a shipyard in St Helens, Lancashire, from 1910‚Äì1914. He was fluent in both French and Italian, and gave a home of record in Le Havre when he joined the Royal Flying Corps.Franks et.al. (1997), p.6. World War I service=Military appointments On 1 August 1915 he was promoted from Second Lieutenant to Lieutenant. Temporary Captain Burbidge was appointed an Adjutant in the Army Service Corps on 1 June 1916. He was superseded as Adjutant on 30 July 1917. On 7 October 1917, Burbidge was transferred to the RFC's General List, with seniority backdated to 10 September. Aerial victories On 25 September 1917, Burbidge helped drive down an Albatros D.V out of control for an aerial victory shared with Sgt. William Benger. At mid- day 2 October over Dadizeele, Burbidge drove down two D.Vs five minutes apart for wins two and three. On 13 November, he teamed with pilot ace Lt. Robert Kirby Kirkman to drive down another Albatros D.V out of control; they repeated the feat on 5 December 1917, and Burbidge was an ace. On 21 February 1918, Burbidge was transferred to Home Establishment. He rejoined 20 Squadron in September. He was flying with Thomas Traill when they destroyed a Fokker D.VII north of Saint Quentin on 29 September 1918. He was also flying with Traill when they collided with another \\"Brisfit\\", losing part of a wing; Burbidge climbed out onto the opposite wings, which stabilized their broken plane enough for Traill to be able to crash-land. Burbidge was slightly injured, breaking his nose and biting through his tongue.Franks et.al. (1997) Post World War I Burbidge served in 22 Squadron, then in 12 Squadron in Cologne, Germany. On 23 October 1919, Burbidge transferred to the Royal Air Force's unemployed list. Honours and awards ;Distinguished Flying Cross Lieut. (Hon. Capt.) Leslie William Burbidge. (FRANCE) :On 23 October this officer displayed marked gallantry and bravery. After destroying a hostile machine his own machine collided, by mischance, with another of his formation on the return journey, and at once began to fall out of control. Capt. Burbidge, with great presence of mind and considerable personal risk, climbed out on to the damaged plane, and so enabled his pilot to regain partial control, maintaining this position till the machine slowly side-slipped on to the ground. By his courageous action this officer undoubtedly saved the life of his pilot at considerable danger to his own, for, on the machine striking the ground, he was thrown from the plane and received serious injuries to his face.

They were influenced by the DIY ethic of punk and fanzines being produced in the British independent music scene.SPC The first issue was launched at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in November 1994. It included contributions from 35 artists, who each hand-made their contribution in a limited edition of 100 copies, which are each signed and numbered by the artist. The 'object-magazine' was contained inside an A5 sized cardboard box. Also inside each box was a printed booklet produced by Forsyth and Pollard that contained information about each contributor and a specially commissioned preface and introductory text. Issues 2-9 included contributions from 20 artists, with issue 10 returning to the format of issue 1 and including 35 artists. The magazine was published three times per year until November 1997 when the final issue was again launched at the ICA in London. Every issue of the magazine was accompanied by a launch party, some of which included live music and performances from some of the contributors. Launch venues included the Artist Book Fair at the Royal Festival Hall, The Cabinet Gallery in Brixton, The Serpentine Gallery Bookshop, the Barbican Centre and the Eagle Gallery in Farringdon. Although named only Words & Pictures for the pilot issue, from issue 1 onwards the title was expanded to include a phrase created by Momus in his preface text for the issue, giving the project the full title it would be known by for the remaining ten issues: Words & Pictures - Ultra-Paranoid (Extra-Spatial) Portable Art!

The final issue included an epilogue by Momus, who had written the preface to the first issue, and a conclusion by Liam Gillick, who had written the first introduction. The closing party was held at the ICA, where the first issue had been launched. The event took place on the same night that Sensation opened at the Royal Academy. Three former contributors were invited to perform; Tracey Emin was unable to attend due to prior commitments so made a video of herself reading C.V. the text she had contributed to issue 4. This film is now part of the collection of the Tate Gallery.Tate Billy Childish performed a series of his poetry and songs, including his text for Words & Pictures and Momus concluded the party with a live set, including a reading of his text.

He used his creative skills to build markets for new products such as Ban roll-on deodorant at Bristol-Myers, Cran-Apple juice for the Ocean Spray cooperative, and Manwich canned sloppy joe sauce for Hunt- Wesson. Early life and career Gelsthorpe was born on June 14, 1921 in Philadelphia. He was raised in Winchester, Massachusetts, and in Pleasantville, New York. His tuition for Hamilton College was covered by a wealthy relative who expected him to become a clergyman, but the advent of World War II led Gelsthorpe to enlist in the United States Navy in 1942 following his graduation with a degree in philosophy and English literature. He served in the Pacific Theater of Operations on a destroyer escort. During action in the Mariana Islands, Gelsthorpe was awarded service stars for his efforts to protect fellow soldiers who were being attacked by Japanese troops; he left the Navy as a lieutenant.Grimes, William. \\"Edward Gelsthorpe, Master Marketer, Dies at 88\\", The New York Times, September 27, 2009.

He bought on the spot the rights to a design offered to him by an amateur inventor that would apply deodorant using a roll-on ball similar to the way ink is applied to paper by a ballpoint pen, leading to the introduction of Ban in 1955; it became one of the firm's best- selling products.

Largely selling a seasonal product, consumed at Thanksgiving and Christmas, the cooperative had been facing declining sales that resulted from warnings issued in the late 1950s about potentially cancer-causing chemicals sprayed on the cranberries.Fenton, John H. \\"Cranberries Gain New Dining Role; Can Be a Cocktail\\", The New York Times, November 26, 1964.

Working together with Sylvia Schur of Creative Food Services, Gelsthorpe was able to oversee the development of several brand extensions, including its blockbuster Cranapple and other fresh and frozen fruit juice mixes, as well as a cranberry-orange relish. Sales doubled with these new products as well as efforts to promote the use of cranberry juice in mixed drinks, all leading to his nickname of \\"Cranapple Ed\\". Gelsthorpe was hired by Hunt-Wesson in 1968 as its CEO and president. He oversaw the expansion of the company's narrow product variety with the introduction of single serving Snack Pack shelf- stable puddings, Manwich sloppy joe sauce, and Skillet Dinners. To accelerate the expansion of the firm's product line, Gelsthorpe often pushed for products to begin distribution before all market research had been completed.

It was written by Jorge Amado in 1961, and translated into English by Harriet de On√≠s in 1964. Background Home is the Sailor was finished by Jorge Amado in early 1961, the year in which he was elected to the Brazilian Academy of Letters. It was originally published in a volume of the same name, along with the short novel The Two Deaths of Quincas Wateryell. Told as an old-mariner's tale, the story paints a portrait of Bahian society in the early 20th century as represented by the small coastal town of Periperi. Plot In his old age Vasco Moscoso Arag√£o, Master Mariner, arrives in Periperi. His stories of distant and exotic ports and exotic and sensual women, make all the town's inhabitants become envious. The sole exception is Chico Pacheco, who does not believe him, and thinks that he is a braggart. After some investigation in Salvador, Chico returns with his version of events: Vasco is a wealthy businessman who lived a bohemian life in his youth with a group of friends, and who then took the title of Commander to satisfy his desire to have a title and not simply be known as \\"Mr. Vasco\\". His friends gave him the title of commander, and even awarded him a medal, obtained illegally. Vasco identified himself so strongly with his role that he started to wear official uniforms complete with medals, smoking his pipe, and collecting sea objects. Now the two versions of Vasco's life, the commander's and Chico Pacheco's, divide the town into those who believe in the commander and those who believe him to be a boastful liar. Fate leads Vasco Moscoso to command a ship sailing from Salvador to Bel√©m, stopping in various ports along the coast. The commander also decides to show his friends of Periperi that he is a real sea captain. The trip takes place without incident; in fact, Vasco leaves the management to the second officer. But upon arrival in the state of Par√† in Bel√©m, the second officer makes fun of the commander, asking him how many ropes are required to moor the vessel in port, saying it is a maritime tradition that the master decides how to moor the ship. Undecided, the commander says all the ropes, and laughter erupts on the ship in the port and across Bel√©m. Realizing his mistake, Vasco takes refuge in a cheap boarding house, gets drunk on cacha√ßa, and falls asleep deeply saddened and disappointed. But that night the city of Belem endures the most violent storm that anyone has ever seen, leaving roofless houses, corpses, destroyed plantations, and a ruined port. All ships are damaged or drifting except for the ship of Captain Vasco Moscoso Arag√£o, which remains intact and durable, just as it docked. The commander returns victorious to Periperi, honored by awards and acclaimed by all the newspapers; the citizens who had previously defamed him are now his most ardent fans. The dream of the commander can continue.

Despite its victories, Bulgaria was exhausted from decades of warfare, and was furthermore threatened in its northern borders by the Magyars. Consequently, the Bulgarians decided to make peace with Constantinople. Negotiations followed at Mesembria, which proved successful: not only was peace agreed upon, but the links between Byzantium and Bulgaria were to be strengthened by a dynastic marriage of Tsar Peter with Maria Lekapene, the Byzantine emperor's granddaughter.. Theophanes played a crucial role in the negotiations prior to the final signing of the treaty, and, together with Sursubul, was witness at the wedding of Peter and Maria.. Theophanes proved his diplomatic skills yet again in April 934, when a large Magyar raid descended into Thrace. He met the raiders in person and arranged terms for their withdrawal and for the release of their captives in exchange for sums of money.. The Byzantine fleet under Theophanes repels the Rus' in 941. Miniature from the Madrid Skylitzes. Soon, however, Theophanes would have the chance to acquire military glory as well: in early summer 941, the Byzantines received word from Bulgaria that a Rus' fleet of some 1,000 ships was sailing towards the Bosporus and Constantinople. At that point, the Byzantine capital was well-nigh defenceless, for the imperial army was fighting in the east under John Kourkouas and the navy was engaged with the Arabs in the Mediterranean.. Fifteen old chelandia were discovered in one of Constantinople's harbours, put in order, outfitted with siphons for the discharge of Greek fire, and placed under the command of Theophanes. The improvised squadron met the Rus' at the entrance of the Bosporus, and through the use of Greek fire, turned them back.; . The bulk of the raiders then turned east and made landfall in Bithynia, plundering the province. As the local Byzantine forces rallied there and the army began to arrive from the East, the Rus' found themselves increasingly constrained. Trying to evade the Byzantines and return to their homeland, one night in September they tried to cross over into Thrace. Theophanes, however, now placed in command of the entire navy, was vigilant, and the Rus' fleet was annihilated. Theophanes returned in triumph to the Byzantine capital, where he was raised to the post of parakoimomenos as a reward.; . The parakoimomenos Theophanes (right, kissing the image) receives the Mandylion. Miniature from the Madrid Skylitzes. At the same time, Kourkouas's victories in the East brought not only new territory to the Byzantine Empire: in 944, he forced the city of Edessa to surrender one of the holiest of Christendom's relics, the \\"Mandylion\\". Theophanes was sent at the head of the Byzantine delegation to receive it from an Edessene embassy at the river Sagaris, and thence convey it to Constantinople, where it was received with great pomp and ceremony.. This triumph, however, was to be the last for Emperor Romanos. His eldest sons and co-emperors, Stephen and Constantine, overthrew him in December 944 and exiled him to the island of Prote. Shortly after, another palace coup deposed them as well, and restored power to the legitimate emperor, Constantine VII.. Theophanes was one of the few officials of the previous regime to remain in power; soon, however, he plotted together with the Patriarch of Constantinople Theophylaktos Lekapenos to return Romanos from his exile and restore him to the Byzantine throne. The plot was uncovered sometime in 947, and Theophanes was deposed and exiled. The date and place of his death are unknown..

Usually recording under the name M.Craft, he has released several albums on various labels, most recently signing with London's Heavenly Recordings. He also spent several years playing guitar with Jarvis Cocker. Early life Craft was born in Canberra, Australia, but grew up in the UK as his father worked for the Department of Foreign Affairs. The family returned to Canberra in 1988, where Craft attended Narrabundah College, forming the band Sidewinder with brother Nick whilst still in school. He studied piano and composition at the Canberra School of Music for several years, before moving to Sydney. M. Craft The mini-album I Can See It All Tonight (2004) saw Craft begin to be given critical acclaim in the press.http://www.uncut.co.uk/reviews/album/m-craft-i- can-see-it-all-tonight Craft began work on an album, much of which was recorded in home studios around Dalston, where Craft has lived for many years. A full-length record Silver and Fire was released in 2006 and saw Craft's reputation as a songwriter and producer become more widely recognized. As well as receiving substantial airplay, Craft also appeared live at many festivals in Europe, at the Spiegeltent as part of the Sydney festival in Australia, where Silver and Fire was released under his full name of Martin Craft with an added disc of bonus tracks. Although Craft's relationship with 679 Recordings ended after Silver and Fire, he continued to work as an independent artist and producer and released a second album in late 2009, titled Arrows at the Sun. Having lived in London for over a decade, Craft relocated to California in 2013, and was based firstly in Los Angeles, and then Joshua Tree in the Mojave Desert. While living there he conceived and recorded the album Blood Moon, which attracted the attention of Jeff Barrett of Heavenly Recordings. The label released the album on 17 June 2016. The music video for the single Chemical Trails was directed by fellow Australian, photographer George Byrne. Blood Moon features ten songs based on piano improvisations by Craft. Participating performers are Seb Rochford, Kristina Train and Mary Lattimore.https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/23/m-craft-blood-moon- review-melodic-night-sky-prettiness Craft tended to play most of the instruments on his own records, and has most often acted as his own engineer and producer.

The LCH Group consists of to subsidiaries: LCH Ltd (based in London) and LCH SA (based in Paris). Based on 2012 figures, LCH cleared approximately 50% of the global interest rate swap market, and was the second largest clearer of bonds and repos in the world, providing services across 13 government debt markets. In addition, LCH clears a broad range of asset classes including: commodities, securities, exchange traded derivatives, credit default swaps, energy contracts, freight derivatives, interest rate swaps, foreign exchange and Euro and Sterling denominated bonds and repos. LCH's members comprise many of the major financial groups including almost all of the major investment banks, broker dealers and international commodity houses. LCH, being a clearing house, sits in the middle of a trade assuming the counterparty risk involved when two parties trade guaranteeing the settlement of the trade. To mitigate the risks involved it imposes certain minimum requirements on its members and collects initial and variation margin (or collateral) from them for trades that have been executed. History LCH traces its roots back to the London Clearing House, established in 1888, and the Paris-based Clearnet, established in 1969. Both developed from clearing commodity transactions. They merged in 2003 to LCH.Clearnet. In 2013 the London Stock Exchange Group acquired a majority stake in the business in 2013. In 2016 LCH.Clearnet dropped Clearnet from its branding name. London Clearing House *1888 - The London Produce Clearing House (LPCH) is established to clear commodities contracts in London. Shares are in public ownership and the company is listed on the London Stock Exchange. *1951 - LPCH is wholly acquired by United Dominions Trust. *1971 - The company is renamed the International Commodities Clearing House ICCH. *1980 - Ownership passes to a consortium of six British banks. *1992 - ICCH divests the clearing software business to Sungard and is renamed the London Clearing House Ltd (LCH). *1996 - Majority ownership of LCH transfers to the whole clearing membership, with the LME, IPE and LIFFE acquiring minority ownership. *2003 - LCH.Clearnet Group is formed following the merger of the London Clearing House and Clearnet SA.

IDCG became a U.S. subsidiary of LCH.Clearnet, reinforcing LCH.Clearnet's presence in the U.S. marketplace, where it already operated IRS clearing through its SwapClear service. *2013 - London Stock Exchange Group acquired a majority stake in the business. *2016 - LCH.Clearnet drops \\"Clearnet\\" from its name. It will be called LCH henceforth. Products LCH provides clearing or central counterparty services in the following markets: Commodities LCH has over 100 years experience clearing commodities, and provides clearing and settlement services for both the exchange traded and the OTC commodity markets. LCH clears commodities including non-ferrous metals (100 million metal trades are cleared annually), plastics and steel which are exchange traded on the London Metal Exchange, as well as a broad range of futures and options contracts covering soft and agricultural products. It also clears over-the-counter products including gold, coal, steel and iron ore and fertilizer swaps. Credit Default Swaps In 2012, LCH launched its international CDSClear service, working with a further 10 international institutions in addition to the four French member banks. This builds on the previous service which initially covered European indices. The CDS service provides full STP multilateral clearing, reduced counterparty risk and post-trade anonymity and encompasses the core requirements as determined by key industry and policy groups, including ISDA, CESR, the ECB and the European Commission. The service also allows members a flexible set of facilities to manage their non-cash collateral placed at LCH. Derivatives LCH is the largest and only user-owned and user-governed global supplier of clearing services to the derivatives markets. This is either directly to the user community or by operating the clearing process on behalf of a third party via an insourcing arrangement, providing services to clients for Short Term Interest Rates (STIRs), Indexes and Equity derivatives. =Energy= LCH provides clearing services to clients for OTC Emissions trading and the US electricity trading on the Nodal Exchange (the first independent electronic commodities exchange offering locational forward trading products and services to participants in the organised North American power markets). LCH also provided services for Bluenext Futures EUA and Bluenext Futures CER, and today future contracts on EU Allowances and on Certified Emission Reductions. =Equities= EquityClear, LCH's equity clearing service, offers clearing for equities and equity equivalents such as exchange traded funds (ETFs), exchange traded commodities (ETCs), real estate investment trusts (REITS) and exchange traded bonds. LCH clears equity-based trades that are executed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), SIX Swiss Exchange, BATS Chi-X Europe, NYSE Euronext, Bourse de Luxembourg and Equiduct. =Centrally cleared CFDs= LCH was the first in Europe to launch a clearing service for contracts for difference (CFDs) and the first clearer globally to offer CFD clearing for institutional investors. CFDs were first launched in the UK in the early 90s as a short access product. Since then their use has grown across the world. LCH's centrally cleared CFD (ccCFD) service, in conjunction with Chi-X Europe, are an alternative to the traditionally over-the-counter traded CFDs and is line with the European Commissions‚Äô aim to increase the proportion of cleared OTC contracts. =Fixed Income= LCH has been working with fixed income markets since 1998, and provides clearing services covering French, Italian and Spanish Government debts, on cash and repo transactions traded by financial institutions including Euro-MTS, MTS-France, MTS Italy, ICAP (BrokerTec) and Tullett Prebon, and trade providers such as the Euroclear Trade Capture and Matching System (EUROCLEAR's matching system), and Viel/Tradition. LCH's RepoClear service was established in partnership with leading banks in 1999, as the first multi market centralised clearing and netting facility for some 13 European government repo and cash bond markets, and a range of pan-European ‚Ç¨GC Baskets. As of 2012 monthly volumes averaged c. ‚Ç¨13 trillion, and RepoClear clears cash bond and repo trades in the following markets: Austrian, Belgian, Dutch, German, Irish, Finnish, Portuguese, Slovakian, Slovenian, Spanish and UK government bonds. Additional markets served include: German Jumbo Pfandbriefe and Supranationals, Agency and Sovereign. There are ‚Ç¨12 trillion repo trades per month (based on nominal value) cleared through LCH. =Freight= LCH's Freight service was launched in September 2005 with the support of the freight broking community. It provides an independent clearing service for the registration of OTC Forward Freight Agreements (FFAs) for the most actively traded routes; thirteen dry and ten wet routes, as well as options on the four dry timecharter routes: Capesize, Panamax, Supramax and Handysize. Container Freight In June 2010 LCH, as a member of the Container Freight Derivatives Association, launched a clearing service for the containerised freight market. The service provides an independent clearing service for the registration of OTC Container Freight Swap Agreements (CFSAs) for four of the most actively traded routes out of Shanghai. =Interest Rate Swaps= SwapClear is a global clearing service for OTC interest rate swaps, and currently clears more than 50% of the global notional market. Launched in 1999, SwapClear initially cleared plain vanilla interest rate swaps in four major currencies. Today it clears swaps in 17 currencies; USD, EUR, and GBP out to 50 years, AUD, CAD, CHF, SEK and vanilla JPY out to 30 years and the remaining 9 currencies out to 10 years. It also clears OIS out to 2 years in USD, EUR, GBP and CHF. To date, over 2 million trades in SwapClear have an aggregate notional principal amount of over $316 trillion. In September 2008, LCH successfully managed Lehman Brothers‚Äô US $9 trillion interest rate swap default, comprising over 66,000 trades, by implementing SwapClear's default management process. The default was fully resolved well within the margin held and at no loss to other market participants. In December 2009 SwapClear launched a new Client Clearing Service, a first for the buy-side community to access clearing interest rate swaps. The service offers unique levels of security to clients and has added functionality to support the segregation of client portfolios and margin. =Foreign exchange= Since the Lehman Brothers collapse, market weaknesses have been under intense scrutiny from financial institutions and regulators alike, and therefore financial markets are currently undergoing a period of unprecedented regulatory reform. A key area of proposed legislation is mandatory central clearing for some OTC derivative instruments, including foreign exchange. After in-depth research and analysis of the FX derivatives market and its inherent risks, LCH launched a new custom-built non-deliverable FX forward (NDF) clearing solution, ForexClear. ForexClear covers the most actively traded currencies in the NDF marketplace. Subsequent phases of development will include a broader range of currencies and tenors, along with additional OTC foreign exchange products such as NDOs, FXOs, NDF crosses, Forwards and Swaps. Regulation LCH is regulated or overseen by the national securities regulator and/or central bank in each jurisdiction from which it operates. # Regulated as a Compagnie financi√®re by the Autorit√© de Contr√¥le Prudentiel et de R√©solution (France). # Regulated as a Derivatives Clearing Organization by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. # Regulated as a Recognised Clearing House by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

Early life and service Alessandro Buzio was born in Pavia on 13 January 1893. He studied accounting in school. On 13 December 1913, he reported for his reserve officer training in military service with the 1st Engineers Regiment. After earning a couple of promotions in the enlisted ranks, Buzio was commissioned as a Sottotenente in the 5th Engineers Regiment on 8 November 1914.Franks et al 1997, p. 135. Aerial service in World War I On 23 May 1915, Buzio was assigned to aviation duty. He began pilot's training on 9 June 1915. On 7 December 1915, he was awarded his military pilot's license. By February 1916, Buzio was flying Macchi Parasols. On 24 April 1916, he was posted to 75a Squadriglia. On 27 June 1916, he scored his first aerial victory in concert with Guido Nardini and other Italian pilots. This feat earned him a Bronze Medal for Military Valor. In October 1916, he was promoted to Tenente. On 27 April 1917, he was posted to the 81a Squadriglia. He would score another shared victory while with this squadron, and be awarded a Silver Medal for Military Valor. He would score his third victory with 76a Squadriglia on 22 September 1917, though records show his official transfer as being on 1 November. He would score three more times with 76a, with a couple of shared victories on 3 May 1918 rounding off his tally. On 15 July 1918, during the Battle of the Piave River, Buzio managed to taxi his Hanriot Scout airplane into that of Lieutenant J. W. Davis of No. 66 Squadron RAF in a ground accident. Post World War I A postwar committee from military intelligence vetted the wartime aerial victory claims and released verification on 1 February 1919.Franks et al 1997, p. 116. Alessandro Buzio was credited with five confirmed victories. Buzio served in the air force reserves in the 1930s. In 1940, he left flight status as a Tenente Colonnello.

It originally aired on September 28, 2009.  Plot  Future Ted describes a date he went on in 2009, and the screen quickly changes to show a side-by-side shot of him preparing in 2009 and 2002. It turns out that Ted is about to go on a blind date with Jen, a woman he went on another blind date with in 2002. Meanwhile, the rest of the gang grapples with relationship questions. Though Barney claims to have tickets to an origin of Chewbacca exhibit, which Marshall is genuinely excited about, they instead head to the Lusty Leopard strip bar, where Marshall is uncomfortable because he considers fantasies cheating. He explains to Barney that every time he wants to fantasize, he must create an elaborate scenario where Lily must die of a terminal illness. While they discuss this, Jasmine (Alyson Hannigan)‚Äîa stripper who looks exactly like Lily‚Äîappears on stage, exciting Barney to no end. After going to exactly the same restaurant and exchanging the same dialogue, including a pun about shellfish that Jen describes as \\"really bad\\", Ted and Jen realize they are repeating their blind date from seven years ago. They remember that the date was horrible, from Ted's snobbish behavior to Jen's obsession with her cats and her ex-boyfriend. Frightened by the prospect of having to date everyone in New York City again, they decide to retrace their steps to find the mistakes of the first date. Barney and Marshall return to MacLaren's and tell Robin and Lily about Lily's doppelg√§nger. It is also revealed that the gang has seen two other doppelg√§ngers; a butch \\"Lesbian Robin\\", and \\"Mustache Marshall\\", Hispanic lawyer Se√±or Justicia. Lily is excited about the find, but Robin gets mad about Barney going to a strip club. Barney makes Marshall tell Lily about his death fantasies that he uses to justify thinking about other women. Learning new things about themselves on the first date, Ted and Jen head to MacLaren's, where the gang is there to help them retrace the events of the 2002 date. Jen reveals that she thought Ted was checking out a woman at the bar, when Ted and Barney were really looking at \\"Mustache Marshall\\". Ted and Jen head up to the roof, and after they share a kiss they suddenly realize why they never had another date: Ted never called her. Ted apologizes for his blunder and gives a version of what might have happened had they gotten together. Lily tells Marshall she's fine with him thinking about other women, at least as long as she's alive in the fantasy. She takes Marshall back to the strip club to fantasize about her doppelg√§nger to get over his discomfort. Barney and Robin go too, where everyone recognizes him, stoking Robin's anger. She tells Barney how uncomfortable the thought of him going to a strip club makes her, but he ignores her. Lily is so enthralled by her stripper twin that she and Marshall get a private dance. Robin wants to have a serious talk about the relationship, but Barney remains oblivious. Before Ted and Jen can kiss again on the roof, he stops and realizes that their quirks are part of who they are and that they should hold out for someone who'll not just tolerate them, but like them. Future Ted then tells his kids that when he told the shellfish pun to their mother, she laughed (almost completely sincerely). Back at the strip club, Marshall comments to Lily that Jasmine is having trouble on stage. When \\"Lily\\" responds with a thick accent, a rather sullen tone and a cigarette in hand, \\"Jasmine\\" falls on stage and, realising that Lily has traded places with Jasmine and is now onstage, leaps up to help her.  Production  This episode was originally planned for season 4 but was shelved due to the complicated dual timeline. At the time the show had not yet been renewed for a fifth season.  Critical response  Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club rated the episode with a grade A‚àí. Brian Zoromski of IGN gave the episode 7.5 out of 10. He criticized the episode for its portrayal of Robin as a jealous girlfriend, although he praised the episode for the editing and character appropriate way Ted behaved on his double date.

Their blood and bodily fluids were purportedly poisonous to other humans, as was mentioned in the ancient Indian treatise on statecraft, Arthashastra, written by Chanakya, an adviser and a prime minister to the first Maurya Emperor Chandragupta (c. 340‚Äì293 BCE). In literature A Hindu mythology text, the Kalki Purana, mentions that they can kill a person just by looking at them, and talks about a Visha Kanya named Sulochana, the wife of a Gandharva, Chitragreeva. However, in time, \\"poison damsel\\" passed into folklore, became an archetype explored by many writers, resulting in a popular literary character that appears in many works, including classical Sanskrit texts such as Sukasaptati.Erotic Indian tales from the Sanskrit classic Suksaptati, by G.L. Mathur. Hind Pocket Books, 1971. Page 26‚Äì27 History The Poison Damsel (Sanskrit Vi·π£akanyƒÅ) is a literary figure that appears in Sanskrit literature as a type of assassin used by kings to destroy enemies. The story goes that young girls were raised on a carefully crafted diet of poison and antidote from a very young age, a practice referred to as mithridatism. Although many would not survive, those that did were immune to other poisons and their body fluids would be poisonous to others; sexual contact would thus be lethal to other humans. There also exists a myth that says a Visha Kanya can cause instant death with just a touch. According to Kaushik Roy, Visha Kanyas would kill their targets by seducing them and giving them poisoned alcohol. Some Sanskrit sources narrate that a Visha Kanya was sent by Nanda's minister Amatyarakshasa to kill Chandragupta Maurya and Chanakya diverted them to kill Parvatak. According to the Indian Historical sources Vish kanya was used by Nanda Dynasty founder Mahapadma Nanda to kill the last ruler of Shishunaga Dynasty Kalashoka both of which belonged to mighty Magadha Kingdom.  Contemporary treatments of the theme  Visha Kanya has been a popular theme in Indian literature and folklore, and apart from appearing in classical Sanskrit texts, it has appeared repeatedly in various works like Vishkanya by Shivani and Ek Aur Vish Kanya? by Om Prakash Sharma, who use Visha Kanya as an archetype in their stories‚Äîa beautiful girl who kills when she comes too close. More recently, the archetype has taken a new hue in the HIV/AIDS era, for example in Vishkanya, a 2007 novel, based on the AIDS epidemic in society. Vishakanyas have also been depicted as important characters in the book Chanakya's Chant. In 2009, Vibha Rahi, a lower caste woman has written an autobiography 'Vishkanya: Untold Secrets' in Marathi, in which she portrays how upper caste women make intimate relationships with lower caste people of high profile and destroy their families and social relationships. Over the years, many Hindi films have been made on the subject. The first film, Visha Kanya, was made in 1943, starring Leela Mishra,Vish Kanya (1943) IMDb. and more recently, Vishkanya (1991), starring Pooja Bedi in the lead role.Vishkanya (1991) IMDb. Vishkanya Ek Anokhi Prem Kahani is a soap opera TV series which aired on Zee TV; it starred Aishwarya Khare as Aparajita Ghosh, a Visha Kanya, in the main role. In the story Beeshkanya, Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay wrote about a girl who was supposed to be a Vishkanya and was sent to Magadha in order to assassinate the members of Shaishunaga dynasty. In The Real Life of Sebastian Knight the author Nabokov treats his affair with Irina Guadanini through allusions to the myth of the poison damsel. In the 2015 novel, The Entropy of Bones by Ayize Jama-Everett, the main character fights a group of Visha Kanya. The trope also appears in a set of Nathaniel Hawthorne's stories.

It was engineered by Premier James Mitchell and followed on from the Soldier Settlement Scheme immediately after World War I. Targeting civilians and others who were otherwise ineligible for the Soldiers' scheme, its principal purpose was to provide a labour force to open up the large tracts of potential agricultural land to ultimately reduce dependence on food imports from interstate. It was also seen as boosting the ideals of the White Australia Policy by strengthening the British cultural identity. High levels of post-war unemployment in Britain saw the UK Government seizing on the scheme as a way to reduce dole-queues. Over 6,000 people emigrated to Western Australia under the scheme which was funded jointly by the State, Federal and UK Governments. Mitchell's plan was for land holdings to be cleared and intensively cultivated by the settlers, initially supervised by experienced farmers, to develop a self-sustaining dairy industry. Premier Mitchell was nicknamed \\"Moo-Cow\\" from his perceived obsession with the dairy industry.Gabbedy (1988) p. 39 He and his Nationalist and Country Party colleagues considered the 'unlimited land resources for closer settlement' were the key to the state's economic progress.Stannage (1981) p. 262 History= Individual family settlements  Under an agreement made with the British government, the state would take up to 6,000 men from the UK and settle them on 6,000 farms over a five-year period. Migrant settlers received financial assistance for their and their families' passage to Australia, and in return were required to work in small communities in undeveloped areas in the State's South West and Wheatbelt regions.Gregory, Jenny and Gothard, Jan, ed (1999) pp. 431-432 After often only one or two days of acclimatisation and processing on arrival, properties were allocated by ballot and the settlers transported to their selections. After a period of establishment, the settlers were required to repay a 30-year loan (not exceeding ¬£1,000) provided by the Agricultural Bank, and at the completion of the loan repayment the settler would have freehold title to the property. They were paid 10 shillings per day during the land clearing phase and offered a ¬£10 loan for the purchase of household and agricultural equipment.Gabbedy (1988) pp. 233-234 \\"The Migration Agreement, Schedule A.\\" The loan was interest-only for the first five years. The communities (or groups) typically comprised between twelve and twenty families. They cleared land, built fences and established their farms in areas which had previously been unable to attract settlers. The promises made to applicants were often unrealistic and sometimes grossly misleading, and caused many to resign and walk off the properties soon after arrival and realisation of the task before them. For those that did persevere, communities endured considerable hardships and deprivation. Inadequate resources were provided, and the settlers often lacked the necessary farming skills and suitability for rural enterprise. Unsuitable equipment was often supplied for clearing the immense hardwood timber forests. Uneconomic farm sizes and depressed agricultural prices forced consolidations and various changes to the scheme. In some areas, poor land quality also led to failures. The extreme isolation in the virgin forests and lack of infrastructure such as roads and communications made life difficult. By April 1924, 30% of migrants and 42% of Australians had abandoned their allocations. Others stayed as they had no alternative. Sustenance payments were made to support many families.  Group settlements  The term \\"Group Settlement\\" was believed to have come from a suggestion made by a British soldier-settler John Wozencroft who had been assigned a allotment near Lefroy Brook at Pemberton. After selecting his property from a plan in Perth with advice from the Lands Department, Wozencroft travelled to Pemberton only to discover it to be impossibly isolated and that the heavily timbered property could only be cleared with the assistance of a small team of men. He wrote a letter directly to Premier Mitchell saying that he and his government \\"should be had up for misrepresentation\\".Gabbedy (1988) pp. 78-79 Mitchell reacted quickly, possibly fearing a public relations issue, and despatched Barbe More, a Lands Inspector at Bunbury. More interviewed Wozencroft in November 1920 who relayed his suggestion that future allotments be made to four of five settlers in a group, and that an expert adviser be initially assigned to each group to assist and advise. The first group settlement was at Manjimup in 1921 and comprised eighteen blocks.Gabbedy (1988) p. 117 Other settlements were established in Northcliffe, Denmark, Nornalup, Walpole, and Bridgetown. A programme of draining the vast floodplains above the Peel-Harvey Estuary was instigated during the same period. This freed up potential farmland in the Peel Estate which was subdivided and allocated to many of the groups. The sandy soils were found to be of poor quality however, and mostly unsuited for cattle grazing or pastures. In 1924-25 the government established a Royal Commission on Group Settlement. The Commission's final report was published on 9 June 1925 and included:Gabbedy (1988) p. 86 > The new method of land settlement was put into effect in March 1921, when > Group 1 was started on its way to Manjimup. This group in common with the > first 40 inaugurated between this date and December 1922 was made up mainly > of colonials or migrants of some years standing, but from then onwards the > groups became composed almost entirely of migrants. At that time there were 127 groups in operation throughout the South-West. Establishment of new groups was abandoned briefly but later resumed with more settlements at Northcliffe, Busselton and Manjimup. Mitchell's successor Philip Collier supported and continued the scheme through most of his Premiership from 1924 to 1930.Gabbedy (1988) pp. 202-204 With the 1930s Depression and the collapse of dairy produce prices, ever more settlers walked off their properties. Politicians called for its scrapping due to the drain of the state's resources with the high failure rate. The last settlement established was at Northcliffe in May 1928. In 1930, government support was finally withdrawn and management responsibility for the remaining settlements passed to the Agricultural Bank. Legacy The policy helped establish a dairy industry which flourishes today, and many successful farms were cleared by the group workers. It also saw the expansion and establishment of a number of townships, schools and rail links. Over 40,000 hectares (100,000 acres) of land was cleared by the scheme which had cost the state ¬£3 million. After World War II, many of the abandoned Group Settlement farms were taken over by immigrants under a new Soldier Settlement Scheme, the next assisted migration scheme. British newspaper magnate Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe, actively promoted the scheme in its early years through his UK newspapers‚Äîespecially The Times. The town of Northcliffe was established through the scheme and named to recognise his role. John Tonkin worked as a teacher at a two-teacher school at the group settlement of Nuralingup (near Augusta) for several years from 1923.Gabbedy (1988) pp. 211-212 He later taught at another group settlement at Margaret River. Tonkin became Labor state premier from 1971 to 1974. He is the only former teacher to have reached the office of premier of the state. The program was succeeded by a Group Migration Scheme operated out of London by the Western Australian Government. Co-ordinated by Digby Blight from 1959 to 1962.

History The term chelandion is derived from the Greek word kelƒìs, \\"courser\\", and first appeared during the early 8th century.. In the medieval Latin used in Western Europe, it was rendered chelandium or scelandrium (and thence the 12th-century sandanum transport), while the Arabs rendered the name as shalandƒ´ (plural shalandiyyƒÅt) and used it for a probably similar type of vessels in their own navies.. In common with the general characteristics of the drom≈çn type, the chelandion was a bireme galley, i.e. with two rows of oars, which provided its main means of propulsion, although it also featured one or two lateen sails, and was steered by two quarter rudders at the stern. It could also be equipped with siphons for projecting the feared Greek fire, the Byzantine navy's secret incendiary weapon. The term chelandion is usually used interchangeably with drom≈çn in medieval literary sources, leading to much confusion as to the exact nature of the ship and its differences with the drom≈çn proper. It appears, however, that the type originated as a horse-transport (hippag≈çgon). This in turn implies some differences in construction from the standard drom≈çn: at the very least, the presence of a special compartment running the length of the vessel amidships to accommodate a row of horses would increase its beam and hold depth.. In the 10th century, chelandia formed the bulk of the Byzantine navy, serving in two types: the chelandion ousiakon () or simply ousiakon or ousiakos, so named because it was manned by an ousia of 108 men, and the chelandion pamphylon (Greek: œáŒµŒªŒ¨ŒΩŒ¥ŒπŒøŒΩ œÄŒ¨ŒºœÜœÖŒªŒøŒΩ), or simply pamphylon or pamphylos, crewed with up to 120‚Äì160 men, its name either implying an origin in the region of Pamphylia as a transport ship or its crewing with \\"picked crews\\" (from , \\"all tribes\\")..

He transferred to the Royal Air Force in 1919, and retired in 1937, but was recalled to serve throughout the Second World War, retiring permanently in 1946. Early life Candy was born on 19 February 1897 in Froyle, Hampshire, England. He was the eldest son of John Alfred Sadler Candy, a farmer, and Emily Louisa French Candy. Military career Candy graduated from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst on 26 October 1916, receiving a commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal Sussex Regiment. Royal Flying Corps career On 2 May 1917 Candy was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps as a temporary flying officer. He was assigned to No. 19 Squadron to fly the SPAD S.VII. He began his scoring streak on 26 August 1917; in cooperation with Alexander Pentland and three other pilots, he destroyed a DFW reconnaissance aircraft over Moorseele. On 30 September, he once again had help in driving down a German two-seater down out of control; on that occasion from Richard Alexander Hewat, Frederick Sowrey, and two other pilots. On 9 October, he teamed with Sowrey and Hewat to drive down an Albatros reconnaissance aircraft. After another shared win on 11 November 1917, two days later, he cooperated with Albert Desbrisay Carter in the destruction of an Albatros D.V. His sixth win, on 29 December 1917, was a solo one, when he drove down another D.V.Shores et.al. (1997), p.97. On 3 June 1918 he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in the King's Birthday Honours. On 6 July 1918 he was appointed flight commander with acting rank of captain. On 1 August 1919 Candy was granted a permanent commission in the RAF with the rank of captain, while also formally resigning his army commission. Royal Air Force career On 5 October 1921 Candy was posted to the RAF Depot (Inland Area), and on 1 October 1923 was assigned to No. 1 School of Technical Training (Boys) at Halton. He then served in the Middle East, being posted to the Aircraft Depot, Iraq, on 27 November 1924, then served as Station Commandant at Basrah from 5 January 1926, before transferring to the RAF Depot, Egypt, on 2 January 1927. On 12 December 1928 he was promoted to squadron leader. On 30 June 1934 Candy was posted to No. 99 (Bomber) Squadron at RAF Upper Heyford for flying duties, and on 11 July 1935 was posted to the Royal Air Force College Cranwell for engineer duties. On 12 September 1937 Candy, at his own request, was placed on the RAF retired list. However, Candy was recalled to duty on 25 August 1939, just prior to the outbreak of the Second World War. He was transferred to the RAF Technical Branch on 24 April 1940. On 23 September 1941 Candy (now an acting wing commander) was mentioned in despatches. He finally reverted to the retired list on 26 January 1946, retaining the rank of wing commander. Personal life On 2 September 1933, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, he married Eileen Marcella Going, the elder daughter of Dr. R. M. Going, of Tollbridge.

The French Republic sought to capture Egypt as the first stage in an effort to threaten British India and support Tipu Sultan, and thus force Great Britain to make peace. Departing Toulon in May 1798 with over 40,000 troops and hundreds of ships, Bonaparte's fleet sailed southeastwards across the Mediterranean Sea. They were followed by a small British squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson, later reinforced to 13 ships of the line, whose pursuit was hampered by a lack of scouting frigates and reliable information. Bonaparte's first target was the island of Malta, which was under the government of the Knights of St. John and theoretically granted its owner control of the Central Mediterranean. Bonaparte's forces landed on the island and rapidly overwhelmed the defenders, securing the port city of Valletta before continuing to Egypt. When Nelson learned of the French capture of the island, he guessed the French target to be Egypt and sailed for Alexandria, but passed the French during the night of 22 June without discovering them and arrived off Egypt first. Unable to find Bonaparte, Nelson turned back across the Mediterranean, eventually reaching Sicily on 19 July. While Nelson was returning westwards, Bonaparte reached Alexandria and stormed the city, capturing the coast and marching his army inland. His fleet, entrusted to Vice-Admiral Fran√ßois-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers, was anchored in a line of battle in Aboukir Bay. On 1 August, Nelson, who had returned to the Egyptian coast after reports gathered at Coron revealed the French invasion, arrived off Aboukir Bay. Although it was late afternoon and the British fleet had no accurate charts of the bay, Nelson ordered an immediate attack on the French van. Brueys was unprepared, and his ships were unable to manoeuvre as the British split into two divisions and sailed down either side of the French line, capturing all five ships of the vanguard and engaging his 120-gun flagship Orient in the centre. At 21:00, Orient caught fire and exploded, killing most of the crew and ending the main combat. Sporadic fighting continued for the next two days, until all of the French ships had been captured, destroyed or fled. At the Battle of the Nile, eleven French ships of the line and two frigates were eliminated, trapping Bonaparte in Egypt and changing the balance of power in the Mediterranean. With the French Navy in the Mediterranean defeated, other nations were encouraged to join the Second Coalition and go to war with France. Portugal, the Kingdom of Naples, the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire all subsequently deployed forces to the Mediterranean. The Russians and Turks participated in the blockade of Egypt and operations in the Adriatic Sea while the Portuguese joined the Siege of Malta, which was distantly conducted by Nelson from his lodgings in Naples. Nelson, who had been wounded at the Battle of the Nile, became involved in Neapolitan politics and encouraged King Ferdinand to go to war with France, resulting in the loss of his mainland kingdom. In the Western Mediterranean, Vice-Admiral Earl St Vincent, who commanded the Mediterranean fleet from off Cadiz, deployed forces against Menorca, rapidly captured the island and turned it into an important naval base. Background=Bonaparte's plan At the beginning of 1798, the War of the First Coalition had come to an end with French control of Northern Italy, much of the Low Countries and the Rhineland confirmed by the Treaty of Campo Formio.Chandler, p. 78 Of all the major European powers that had at one time allied against the French Republic, only the Kingdom of Great Britain remained hostile, and the French Directory determined to end the French Revolutionary Wars by eliminating Britain. A series of invasions of the British Isles were planned,Come, p. 185 and the 28-year-old General Napoleon Bonaparte, who had defeated the Austrians in Italy the previous year, was assigned to lead the Arm√©e d'Angleterre (Army of England) that had been assembled at Boulogne.James, p. 113 However, the English Channel was firmly controlled by the Royal Navy and French invasion supplies, particularly of viable landing craft, were totally inadequate for the purpose.Gardiner, p. 107 In the early spring of 1798, Bonaparte left his command at Boulogne and returned to Paris, reporting that continued British naval supremacy in Northern European waters made an invasion impossible in the near future.Mostert, p. 248 With operations to the north impossible, Bonaparte directed his attention southwards to Toulon, the principal French seaport on the Mediterranean. There a French army and fleet had begun assembling for a secret location, speculated by French commentators to be aimed at a wide variety of places, including among others Britain, Sicily, Malta and the Crimea.Cole, p. 3Maffeo, p. 230 The expedition's intended target was actually Egypt, which formed an important link in the chain of communications between Britain and the economically vital colony of British India.Adkins, p. 7 Bonaparte considered the capture of Egypt as the most important step in neutralising the massive economic benefits that Britain gained from trade with India and bringing Britain to terms: in August 1797 he wrote \\"The time is not far away that we will feel that, in order to truly destroy England, we must take Egypt.\\"Cole, p. 13 Possession of Egypt could grant the French control of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea, forcing severe delays to dispatches sent between Britain and India and obstructing trade worth ¬£2.7 million (the equivalent of ¬£ as of ) to the British economy.Maffeo, p. 227 In addition, a successful invasion of Egypt could be followed by a direct attack on British territory in India, possibly in conjunction with the anglophobic Tippoo Sultan of Seringapatam.Warner, p. 41 The French Mediterranean Fleet was unopposed at the start of 1798 ‚Äì following the Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1796, in which Spain formed an alliance with France and declared war on Britain, the Royal Navy had withdrawn from the Mediterranean bases of Corsica and Elba.Rose, p. 140 By early 1798, their Mediterranean Fleet was based at the Tagus River in Portugal, their one remaining continental ally.Maffeo, p. 224 With no permanent British fleet in the Mediterranean and an uprising imminent in Ireland, Bonaparte firmly believed that the Royal Navy would be unable to intervene in his plans, even if they should discover them.Rose, p. 141 With passage to Egypt seemingly unopposed Bonaparte gave orders for a fleet of thirteen ships of the line, led by the 120-gun Orient under Vice-Admiral Fran√ßois-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers and numerous smaller warships, including the entire Venetian Navy, captured the previous year, to prepare for sea.Gardiner, p. 20 The fleet was to be accompanied by up to 400 transport ships, which were to carry the 35,000 men detailed for the invasion.Clowes, p. 353 On 3 May, Bonaparte departed Paris, arriving at Toulon five days later to oversee the final preparations. On 9 May he reviewed the assembled army and gave a speech announcing that the expedition was bound for an unspecified foreign land. The speech was met with an enthusiastic response from his soldiers and a revised version subsequently appeared in Le Moniteur Universel and was widely distributed throughout France as a poster.Cole, p. 5 Despite Bonaparte's pronouncement the French departure was delayed: a strong headwind prevented the fleet from sailing for another nine days, conditions finally lifting on 18 May that permitted the 22 warships and 120 transports that made up the French fleet to sail the following day.James, p. 150 St. Vincent's response Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson, alt=Portrait of a man in an ornate naval uniform festooned with medals and awards. Britain was not unaware of French preparations at Toulon and along the Mediterranean coast, but despite sustained efforts by British agents in France the destination of the French fleet was unknown.Adkins, p. 8 Egypt was not seriously considered by the British government: when Secretary of State for War Henry Dundas suggested it, he was urged by Foreign Secretary Lord Grenville to think \\"with a map in your hand, and with a calculation of distances.\\"Rodger, p. 458 Letters reached London and St. Vincent at the Tagus describing extensive preparations right along the French and Italian Mediterranean coastlines, but the distances between the base in the Tagus and Toulon prevented any sustained observation of French movements.Maffeo, p. 234 Urgent orders were sent from Lord Spencer at the Admiralty to Vice-Admiral Earl St. Vincent, commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet at the Tagus, to despatch a squadron to investigate under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson. Nelson had returned to the fleet three days earlier at Lord Spencer's order,Bradford, p. 169 following recovery in Britain from the loss of an arm at the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife in July 1797.Gardiner, p. 18 St. Vincent had already been preparing for an expedition to Toulon with Nelson in mind, and the rear-admiral departed the Tagus in his flagship HMS Vanguard on 2 May. St Vincent was overjoyed to be able to place Nelson in command of the mission, writing that \\"the arrival of Admiral Nelson has given me new life ... his presence in the Mediterranean is so very essential\\".Bradford, p. 170 His preference for Nelson over the more senior admirals Sir William Parker and Sir John Orde provoked a storm of protest, which eventually culminated in Orde challenging St Vincent to a duel,Mostert, p. 255 and being subsequently ordered to return to Britain.Warner, p. 45 On 9 May Nelson collected the ships of the line HMS Alexander and HMS Orion under Captains Alexander Ball and Sir James Saumarez the frigates HMS Emerald and HMS Terpsichore under Captains Thomas Moutray Waller and William Hall Gage and the sloop HMS Bonne Citoyenne under Captain Robert Retalick at Gibraltar, and passed into the Mediterranean.Clowes, p. 351 Despite leaving under cover of darkness,Bradford, p. 172 Nelson's departure was observed by Spanish forces at Cadiz, and the fort at Cape Carnero fired several shot, striking Alexander but inflicting negligible damage.Keegan, p. 41 On 17 May Terpsichore captured the privateer La Pierre off Cape Sici√©, and from the crew Nelson learned that Bonaparte's departure was imminent, although the destination was still unknown.Maffeo, p. 239 On 21 May, as his squadron reached the √éles d'Hy√®res near Toulon, they were struck by strong winds that snapped Vanguard's topmasts and brought the wreckage down onto the deck, killing two men. Vanguard was left struggling in heavy seas, blown southwards in one night.Bradford, p. 173 So severe was the damage that Vanguard was almost wrecked on the Corsican coast on the following day and Nelson even ordered Captain Ball, who had managed to attach a towline to the flagship, to abandon him.Padfield, p. 112 Ball refused the order and the British ships of the line rode out the storm together.Mostert, p. 250 Although Alexander was able to tow Vanguard to San Pietro Island off Sardinia for repairs, the gale had forced the squadron's frigates to separate from the larger ships.Padfield, p. 113 Thomas Waller on Emerald was divided from the other frigates, and his lookouts had observed Vanguard in its dismasted state at the height of the storm. The other two frigates had reefed their sails and ridden out the storm together, Captain Gage turning towards the Spanish coast when the storm abated and on 29 May encountered HMS Alcmene under Captain George Johnstone Hope, which had been sent by St. Vincent to augment Nelson's force. Two days later Hope's squadron encountered Emerald, which had captured two merchant ships, and together they sailed for the prearranged rendezvous point off Cape St. Sebastian near Barcelona.Keegan, p. 45 Hope ordered Terpsichore and Bonne Citoyenne to cruise off Sardinia and on 3 June encountered the brig HMS Mutine under Captain Thomas Hardy, the scout of a fleet sent by Earl St. Vincent that was approaching the rendezvous. Knowing of the damaged suffered by Vanguard and aware that the French had left Toulon, Hope then took the unilateral decision to search for the French himself, dispersing the frigates across the Western Mediterranean.Keegan, p. 47 Hope's ships failed to find either the British or French fleets and none of the frigates returned to Nelson's command until after the Battle of the Nile.Maffeo, p. 241 Malta Napoleon's arrival in Malta Departing Toulon on 19 May, Bonaparte's fleet passed along the coast of Provence to Genoa, where 72 additional transport ships were collected.Keegan, p. 40 Sailing south, the fleet reached Corsica on 23 May and collected a fleet of 22 transports from Ajaccio on 28 May.Adkins, p. 11 The convoy remained within sight of the eastern coastline until 30 May, crossing the Strait of Bonifacio and following the coastline of Sardinia in anticipation of combining with fleets of transports sailing from Civitavecchia. On 3 June, a message reached Bonaparte reporting the presence of Nelson's squadron at San Pietro and the French general sent a French squadron to investigate, although by that time Nelson had sailed and the harbour was empty. Abandoning the wait for the Civitavecchia force, which had still not arrived, Bonaparte gave orders for his fleet to turn southeast, passing Mazara on Sicily and the island of Pantelleria on 7 June. There a report from a captured British merchant brig warned Bonaparte that Nelson was only a short distance behind his force with a powerful Royal Navy fleet and, concerned for his transports, Bonaparte gave urgent orders for the French fleet to steer for Malta, arriving off Valletta at 05:30 on 9 June, shortly after uniting with the 56 ships of the Civitavecchia convoy, which had missed the rendezvous and continued to Malta alone.Maffeo, p. 259 The report on Nelson's activity submitted to Bonaparte on 7 June was inaccurate: Repairs to Vanguard in San Pietro took six days, the squadron sailing on 27 May for Toulon, arriving off the harbour on 31 May.Clowes, p. 354 Nelson had already learned of the departure of the French fleet from a captured Marseilles merchant ship, but without reinforcements or knowledge of the French direction he could not begin a pursuit.Keegan, p. 44 On 5 June, the brig HMS Mutine arrived off Toulon and reported that a British fleet was only a few days away, consisting of ten ships of the line and a fourth rate sent by Earl St Vincent from the Tagus on 24 May under Captain Thomas Troubridge in HMS Culloden.James, p. 152 St Vincent, acting under urgent orders from London to send a fleet to the Mediterranean had opted to split his forces, rather than risk taking all of his ships into the Mediterranean and leaving the Spanish at Cadiz unattended. Troubridge was considered by St Vincent to be the best officer in the fleet, and Nelson, who also held a high opinion of Troubridge, immediately sailed his squadron to the scheduled rendezvous point.Bradford, p. 175 On 6 June, his squadron briefly intercepted a Spanish merchant convoy and capturing two ships before the admiral called off the pursuit to ensure he arrived at the agreed time. On 7 June at 12:00 the fleets combined, Nelson now commanding 13 74-gun ships of the line, one 50-gun ship and one brig.Maffeo, p. 243 Noticeable by their absence were frigates, vital for scouting operations in a campaign of this nature; After his encounter with Hope, Hardy reported to Nelson that the frigates were cruising independently, to which the admiral bitterly responded \\"I had thought that Hope would have known me better\\".Mostert, p. 251 Nelson's search Delayed until 10 June by a calm and still unaware of French intentions, Nelson initially sailed along the Corsican coast, before anchoring at Elba on 12 June and sending Mutine into Civitavecchia for information. Hardy was unable to discover the French destination and, after a detour to Elba with his whole fleet, Nelson continued south.Keegan, p. 48 Two days later, the admiral spoke with a Tunisian ship at Giannutri, which passed on the inaccurate information that the French had been seen off Trapani,Mostert, p. 253 and might be anchored at Syracuse.Clowes, p. 355 On 17 June Nelson anchored at the Pontine Islands off Naples and sent Troubridge ashore to appeal to the British ambassador Sir William Hamilton for information and for the assistance of the Neapolitan Navy in scouting for the French. Although the Neapolitan Prime Minister Sir John Acton had already passed on reports that the French were sailing for Egypt, Hamilton did not give the report to Nelson, possibly suspicious of disinformation.Keegan, p. 50 Hamilton did however relay the information that Bonaparte's fleet had passed Sardinia and were probably sailing in the direction of Malta. Despite private animosity towards France,Warner, p. 55 the Neapolitan government refused to openly join the British in the war and denied Nelson the use of their frigates,Bradford, p. 176 although they did quietly agree to resupply Nelson's fleet. With a rough direction established and believing the ultimate French destination to be Sicily,Bradford, p. 177 Nelson sailed in pursuit, but light winds hampered his advances and he did not pass the Straits of Messina until 20 June. There he received a report from the ambassador at Messina that the French were at Malta. Then on 22 June near Cape Passaro, Hardy stopped a Genoese ship from Ragusa that reported seeing the French fleet sailing southwards away from Malta, and that they had left Valletta on 16 June.Gardiner, p. 29 This information was wrong (or mistranslated) in one important respect: although preparations had begun on 16 June the French had actually not departed until 19 June,Bradford, p. 181 and Nelson's fleet was just away from Brueys'.Rodger, p. 459 Nelson decided that the French target must be Egypt or Constantinople and called his senior captains: Saumarez, Ball, Troubridge and Henry Darby on board Vanguard for a conference. Together these officers determined Egypt as the most likely option, deducing that it was the best location in the Mediterranean from which Bonaparte could threaten India.Padfield, p. 114 Consequently, Nelson turned southeast towards Alexandria, exercising his men's gunnery daily to ensure they were ready for the battle he planned. His plan should his force encounter the French was clear: dividing into three squadrons, his fleet would strike the French at three points. Two squadrons of five ships each would engage the French fleet directly while the third would separate and attack the transports, sinking or capturing as many as possible.James, p. 153 Nelson also deliberately forged close links with his captains at regular dinners aboard his flagship to ensure ease of communication and build confidence between them. He later said of this time that \\"I had the happiness to command a Band of Brothers.\\"Adkins, p. 15 Bonaparte at Malta Fort Rohan, one of the few forts whose garrison fought against the French invasion of Malta While Nelson was gathering his fleet and searching for the French, Bonaparte had secured the first stage of his plan for the invasion of Egypt. Arriving off Malta on 9 June, he demanded that the island's ruler, Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim, the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller (or Knights of St. John of Jerusalem) to allow his fleet to enter the harbour and purchase provisions.Cole, p. 8 Hompesch refused, insisting that only two ships at a time could enter the port. Bonaparte responded by opening fire on the harbour defences and on 11 June landed soldiers at seven sites around Malta under General Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers. Coming under fire from the 2,000 native Maltese soldiers that mustered against the invasion, skirmishing continued in the western part of the island for 24 hours, until General Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois entered Mdina and the defenders withdrew to the fortress of Valletta.Cole, p. 9 The Maltese troops refused to continue the fight without support from their government,Warner, p. 29 and negotiations followed in which Hompesch and the knights agreed to abandon Malta on condition of financial compensation amounting to 3 million Francs. In exchange, Bonaparte gained the entire Maltese archipelago, including fortresses, military stores and cannon, the small Maltese Navy and Army and the entire property of the Roman Catholic Church in Malta.Gardiner, p. 21 The Maltese position had already been severely weakened by the large number of Frenchmen who were part of the Order, who refused en masse to take up arms against Bonaparte. The French Revolution had already significantly reduced the Knights' income and their ability to put up serious resistance to Bonaparte was seriously compromised by a lack of resources.Cole, p. 10 On 12 June, Bonaparte finally announced to his troops the destination of the expedition and on 19 June he sailed for Alexandria, initially steering east towards Crete. He left behind Vaubois and 4,000 men to maintain Malta as a base to control the Central Mediterranean.Adkins, p. 13 To ensure that news of the impending attack on Egypt did not spread ahead of the fleet, Brueys ordered that any merchant ships that sighted the convoy during the passage were to be seized and detained until his force had reached Alexandria.Maffeo, p. 256 On 26 June, the British gained the first firm intelligence of French intentions, when the frigate HMS Seahorse under Captain Edward Foote encountered and captured the French frigate Sensible, which was returning to Toulon from Malta with a cargo of treasure and wounded soldiers, including General d'Hilliers.James, p. 208 From these prisoners the destination of the French fleet was discovered and Seahorse, joined shortly afterwards by Terpsichore, sailed in pursuit, hoping to encounter Nelson.James, p. 160 Arrivals at Alexandria Nelson's passage from Sicily to Alexandria was uneventful, the journey taking six days. Due to his lack of frigates, Nelson was unable to scout to the flanks of his advance and as a result only spoke with three merchant ships, none of which had useful information about the French fleet.James, p. 154 The lack of frigates had already had a decisive effect on 22 June, when the British fleet sighted four sails to the southeast.Mostert, p. 254 Although Captain Thomas Thompson of HMS Leander requested permission to investigate the strangers, Nelson refused and ordered his fleet to continue on their current heading, believing the French to be five days ahead and wishing to reach Alexandria as rapidly as possible.Keegan, p. 56 Had British frigates been available to approach and investigate the distant squadron, they might have discovered that they were scouts for the main French fleet, which was only a short distance away.Adkins, p. 14 The French frigate had sighted the British fleet and reported its presence to Bonaparte, who adjusted his convoy's direction slightly to a more northerly trajectory.Bradford, p. 182 As a result, Nelson's fleet passed north of the French to the east of Malta during the night in a heavy mist. Although Nelson was so close that his signal guns could be heard aboard Orient, his lookouts did not observe the French ships and the British fleet continued ahead without deviating.Maffeo, p. 258 When dawn broke the following day, Bonaparte's diversion to the northeast had taken his convoy out of sight of the British fleet, which continued to the southeast undisturbed.Bradford, p. 185 On 28 June, Mutine arrived at Alexandria ahead of Nelson's fleet, and discovered that the French fleet was not in the harbour.Warner, p. 58 Once the main fleet had arrived, attempts were made to contact the British Consul George Baldwin, but these failed as he had been dismissed by the British government shortly before and had left the city. As a result, official diplomatic channels were closed to Nelson.Bradford, p. 188 A message warning of the French approach was carried to the Ottoman governor Sayyid Muhammad Kurayyim by Hardy in Mutine. Kurayyim replied that he had not seen the French fleet, and that he would enforce the Ottoman Empire's neutrality and forbid both the British and the French from entering the harbour or landing on the coast. He was dismissive of the British warnings: \\"It is impossible that the French should come to our country. They have no business here and we are not at war with them.\\"Maffeo, p. 257 Without Baldwin no further entries could be made, and when there was still no sign of the French on the morning of 29 June, Nelson decided to turn back northeast and take another pass across the central Mediterranean towards Corfu, following a more northerly course than his first voyage. Invasion of Egypt Sphinx, Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me, c. 1868, Hearst Castle, California Bonaparte's fleet, delayed by its many transport ships, passed Cape Durazzo on the island of Crete during 30 June and reached Alexandria the following morning, driven by the fresh meltemi winds.Bradford, p. 187 Bonaparte's first action was to send a small brig into the harbour to collect the French consul, Charles Magallon, who relayed the news of Nelson's stay off the port and of Kurayyim's refusal to allow the French to land.Cole, p. 20 Seriously concerned that Nelson might return while his men were still in their transports, Bonaparte gave orders for the landing to go ahead immediately. Soldiers were landed in the region of the Mirabou Creek, although the appearance of a sail to the east was mistaken for a scout from the British fleet and caused momentary panic, Bonaparte reportedly exclaiming: \\"Fortune, m'abandonnerais-tu? Quoi! Seulement cinq jours!\\" (Fortune, wilt thou abandon me? What! Only five days!). The newcomer was eventually revealed to be the French frigate Justice sent from Malta, and the invasion continued unopposed.James, p. 156 By evening the landing had been completed, although several boats had been wrecked in the surf and Bonaparte himself estimated that at least 20 men had drowned.Adkins, p. 17 On 2 July, Bonaparte led his men to victory in the brief Battle of Alexandria and secured the city. He placed General Jean Baptiste Kl√©ber in command with Rear-Admiral Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley in charge of the harbour. Finding that entrances to the anchorage were too shallow to accommodate the main body of the French fleet, Bonaparte ordered Brueys to sail his squadron to the wider Aboukir Bay, northeast of Alexandria. Brueys was instructed that if he considered the anchorage to be unsafe then he was to sail for Corfu, leaving only a small light force that could anchor comfortably in Alexandria.Mostert, p. 257 There Brueys held a conference with his officers to decide on their response should Nelson discover them in the bay. Although Rear-Admiral Armand Blanquet of Franklin argued that the fleet was safest sailing out to meet the British, he was outvoted and overruled, Brueys ordering that the ships remain anchored in line of battle to receive the British attack.James, p. 159 On 21 July, the frigates Seahorse and Terpsichore arrived at Alexandria and observed the French dispositions while flying French colours to confuse observers from the shore. With no sign of Nelson, Foote and Hall turned back westwards in search of the admiral. When Brueys learned that British frigates had been seen off the Egyptian coast, he decided that the retreat of these vessels signified that there was no danger of imminent attack by a British force and therefore failed to take precautions against attack.Warner, p. 65 Nelson returns Nelson, having sailed northeast on the same day that the first French ships arrived off Alexandria, had reached Anatolia on 4 July and turned westward against the wind, sailing for Sicily again.Bradford, p. 192 His ships were briefly scattered by a storm on 5 July, before reconstituting the following day and on 18 July the British fleet reached Cape Passaro again and on 19 July Nelson's force anchored in Syracuse to take on fresh provisions supplied in part by Emma, Lady Hamilton, the wife of the ambassador to Naples. Frustrated, Nelson wrote in a letter to his wife Fanny; \\"Every moment I have to regret the frigates having left me, to which must be attributed my ignorance of the movements of the enemy.\\"Mostert, p. 258 Reports subsequently reached the British fleet at Syracuse that the French had not been seen in the Eastern Mediterranean, in the Adriatic or in the Aegean Sea, leaving either Egypt or Syria as the only likely destinations.Bradford, p. 195 Sailing once more on 25 July, Nelson turned his ships east once again sailing for Morea and sending Troubridge in Culloden into Coron on 28 July for news.Maffeo, p. 266 The Ottoman governor reported that the French had been seen sailing southwards from Crete at the start of the month and presented Troubridge with a French merchant ship that was anchored in the harbour.Warner, p. 62 With their first definite sighting of the French, the British fleet turned southwards towards Alexandria.Gardiner, p. 30 Battle of the Nile On 1 August, Nelson's fleet reached the Egyptian coast, the ships HMS Swiftsure and HMS Alexander detached as scouts to investigate Alexandria harbour. Although the transport fleet was observed in the harbour, the French battle fleet was not. Despite initial disappointment, Nelson ordered his ships to search the coastline, and at 14:00 lookouts on HMS Zealous reported the French anchored in line of battle in Aboukir Bay.Padfield, p. 118 Brueys believed that his line, protected by shoals to the north and west, was impenetrable and that as a result the British would be forced to attack the rear and centre of his fleet. He consequently placed his strongest ships at these points, planning to stall the British fleet while his van used the prevailing northeasterly wind to counterattack.Padfield, p. 120 Brueys was also confident that the British fleet, strung out and with nightfall approaching, would not attack that day. He believed that Nelson would anchor off the bay and attack in the morning, giving Brueys time to prepare and leaving open the option of simply sailing away during the night, following Bonaparte's orders to avoid a direct confrontation with the British fleet.James, p. 161 Nelson's attack Battle of the Nile, Augt 1st 1798, alt=An engraved print showing a tightly packed line of 13 warships flying the French flag. The ships are firing on eight ships flying the British flag that are steadily approaching them from the right of the picture. Despite Brueys hopes, Nelson was determined to press home his attack at once and ordered his ships to advance, only pausing to fit springs on their anchor cables, which would allow them to easily direct their broadsides in cramped, shallow coastal waters.Clowes, p. 360 Without an accurate chart of the bay, Nelson was forced to be cautious in his advance, and ordered Captain Samuel Hood in Zealous to take soundings as he advanced to establish the depth of the bay.Adkins, p. 24 At 18:20, as the British ships HMS Goliath and Zealous rounded the northern shoal, the leading French ships Guerrier and Conqu√©rant opened fire.Gardiner, p. 33 As he approached the French line, Captain Thomas Foley in Goliath noticed that Brueys had made a serious error in the distribution of his forces. Rather than place his lead ship Guerrier close to the northern shoal, the French admiral had left a gap, widened by the order for the French fleet to only anchor by the bow which meant that they drifted significantly, between Guerrier and the shoals. Sailing directly through this gap, Foley raked Guerrier and engaged the second ship of the French line, Conqu√©rant.Mostert, p. 266 Zealous also passed through the gap and attacked Guerrier, and was followed by HMS Orion, HMS Theseus and HMS Audacious, all of which opened up a fierce fire on the first four French ships against their unprepared port sides.James, p. 165 Nelson followed in Vanguard, bringing the next two ships into action with the starboard side of the French van, catching the French ships in a crossfire that rapidly battered and dismasted the ships, despite determined defence.Clowes, p. 362 As the French van was destroyed, HMS Bellerophon and HMS Majestic attacked the French centre. Outnumbered and faced with the massed broadsides of Orient and the 80-gun Franklin and Tonnant, both British ships suffered massive damage.Adkins, p. 28 Culloden, bringing up the rear of the British line, passed too close to the northern shoal and grounded, Troubridge suffering severe damage to his hull despite efforts by Mutine and Leander to drag the ship off.Clowes, p. 363 By 19:00 darkness had fallen, and within an hour the French van had been defeated, Guerrier, Conqu√©rant, Spartiate, Aquilon and Peuple Souverain all either in British hands or too badly damaged to continue fighting.James, p. 167 The British too had suffered damage, with Vanguard and Goliath badly hit while to the south both Bellerophon and Majestic had been forced to cut their anchor cables and pull away from their respective opponents.James, p. 169 Bellerophon had been dismasted, Majestic's captain George Blagden Westcott had been killed, and on Vanguard Nelson had suffered a severe head wound.Adkins, p. 31 Destruction of Orient Battle of the Nile, alt=A confused naval battle. Two battered ships drift in the foreground while smoke and flame boil from a third. In the background smoke rises from a confused melee of battling ships. Shortly after 20:00, the trailing Swiftsure and Alexander, joined by Leander, attacked the French centre, causing severe damage to Franklin and killing Admiral Brueys on his quarterdeck with a cannon shot.Germani, p. 58 At 21:00, a fire broke out in Orient's stern, the blaze spread further by volleys from Swiftsure that also defeated efforts to extinguish it.Clowes, p. 366 The flames spread rapidly, racing up the masts and across the decks until the entire flagship was a blazing wreck. At 22:00, the vast magazines detonated, tearing the ship apart and hurling burning wreckage onto the neighbouring vessels.Mostert, p. 271 For ten minutes not a shot was fired, as the nearest ships battled to extinguish fires and the further ones paused in shock.Gardiner, p. 36 The first ship to recommence hostilities was Franklin, but Admiral Blanquet's heavily outnumbered flagship was forced to surrender by 24:00.Clowes, p. 367 Tonnant, the only French ship still engaged, fought on against Majestic until 03:00, when the mortally wounded Captain Aristide Aubert Du Petit Thouars succeeded in dragging his ship to the temporary safety of the rear division under Rear- Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve.James, p. 172 At 04:00 on 2 August, firing began again between Villeneuve's ships and a scratch British squadron formed from the less damaged ships.Clowes, p. 368 By 11:00, Villeneuve had conducted a successful fighting withdrawal to the mouth of the bay, and was able to escape to open water.James, p. 173 However, Villeneuve had been forced to abandon the battered Tonnant and the grounded Timol√©on, retaining just two ships of the line and two frigates.Mostert, p. 272 While Villeneuve escaped, British ships received the surrender of Heureux and Mercure, which had grounded shortly after the explosion of Orient, and forced the captain of the frigate Art√©mise to scuttle his vessel. On 3 August, Theseus and Leander were sent to complete the destruction of the French fleet; Tonnant surrendered and Timol√©on was set on fire by its crew and destroyed.Adkins, p. 37 Subsequent operations H.M.S. Leander and the French National Ship Le G√©n√©reux, 18 August 1798, C. H. Seaforthalt=A line drawing depicting a badly damaged ship lying stern on to an even more badly damaged ship. The second ship is firing on the first through a thick bank of smoke. With the exception of Villeneuve's fugitives, the French Mediterranean Fleet had been annihilated. Nine of eleven ships of the line had been captured or destroyed, as well as two frigates. French casualties totalled more than 3,000 and possibly as many as 5,000, compared to British losses of 218 killed and 677 wounded.Clowes, p. 370 However, many of Nelson's ships were seriously damaged, and urgent repairs were required for both his own ships and the captured prizes before they could begin the long voyage back to Britain. For more than two weeks Nelson remained in Aboukir Bay, effecting repairs, writing despatches and assessing the strategic situation in Egypt.Maffeo, p. 273 The first ship detached from his squadron was Leander, sent on 5 August to the fleet under Earl St. Vincent off Cadiz with reports of the battle.James, p. 182 On 8 August Aboukir Island was stormed and captured, and on 12 August Emerald, Alcmene and Bonne Citoyenne finally caught up with the fleet, followed on 17 August by Seahorse and Terpsichore. Mutine was detached on 13 August with despatches for the Admiralty and on 14 August Nelson sent seven ships with the six seaworthy prizes to the mouth of Aboukir Bay under the command of Saumarez.James, p. 183 This convoy sailed for Gibraltar on 15 August and the following day Nelson burnt Heureux, followed on 18 August by Mercure and Guerrier, none of which were fit for continued service. On 19 August Nelson separated his remaining ships, leading three vessels northwards towards Naples and leaving a blockade squadron off Alexandria of Zealous, Goliath, Swiftsure and the frigates, under Captain Samuel Hood.Clowes, p. 373 By the time Nelson departed Alexandria, his first set of dispatches were already in French hands. Leander had been discovered off the western coast of Crete on 18 August 1798 by the French ship of the line G√©n√©reux, one of Villeneuve's escapees.Gardiner, p. 43 After separating from Villeneuve's squadron on 17 August, G√©n√©reux was sailing to Corfu when it encountered the British fourth rate. The larger French ship soon overtook the British vessel and a heated exchange followed: French efforts to board Leander were driven back with heavy casualties, and Captain Thompson at one stage successfully raked his opponent, but gradually the heavier weight of G√©n√©reux inflicted severe damage to the British ship and after six and a half hours Thompson was forced to surrender.James, p. 232 French captain Lejoille then authorised widespread looting of the personal effects of the British crew, whom he also forced to conduct repairs on both ships, an act against the established conventions of naval warfare.Clowes, p. 516 The prize was towed to Corfu for repairs, the two battered vessels briefly encountering Mutine, which escaped to the westwards before G√©n√©reux could give chase. In captivity Lejoille continued to refuse to allow the British officers medical attention or return their stolen property.James, p. 235 Eventually returned to Britain, Thompson and Berry were knighted and heavily praised for their defence of their ship against heavy odds, while Lejoille was also commended for his success, assisted by his incorrect account of the battle published in French newspapers.James, p. 237 Alexandria With the French naval presence in the Mediterranean reduced to a few scattered vessels, the allies of the Second Coalition were able to exert their dominance in the region. Off Alexandria, the squadron under Captain Hood successfully prevented communications between France and the French army in Egypt.James, p. 191 On 22 August, just three days after Nelson sailed north, Alcmene intercepted the 6-gun dispatch vessel L√©g√®re off Alexandria harbour and forced the captain to surrender. As his flag was struck, the captain hurled the dispatches into the sea. This action was witnessed by sailors John Taylor and John Harding aboard Alcmene and both men dived into the water, successfully retrieving the messages.Clowes, p. 376 For their bravery in diving from a rapidly moving ship into unknown waters, both men were granted annual pensions of ¬£20 (the equivalent of ¬£ as of ). Three days after the capture of L√©g√®re, Captain Foley of Goliath sent a boat into the sheltered anchorage under Aboukir Castle, where his men boarded and captured the armed ketch Torride, typical of the gun-vessels that had fired on the British advance during the Battle of the Nile.James, p. 192 On 2 September, another dispatch vessel reached the Egyptian coast, the 4-gun cutter An√©mone carrying General Camin and 60 men from Malta. Swiftsure and Emerald managed to cut off the vessel from Alexandria harbour and drive it ashore near the town of Marabou. Although the cutter swiftly broke up in the surf, most of the men aboard managed to scramble ashore. There, while the British ships lay off shore unable to intervene, Bedouin partisans discovered the survivors and massacred them, dragging the few survivors inland before French cavalry could rescue them.James, p. 193 The only survivors were rescued by Lieutenant Francis William Fane, who swam to shore with an empty barrel attached to a rope. Despite coming under fire from the French on the beach, he was able to save five men from the Bedouin attack. In October the small British squadron at Alexandria was briefly reinforced by a Portuguese squadron of four ships of the line and the 64-gun HMS Lion under Captain Manley Dixon, although the Portuguese sailed for Malta after only a few days. On 19 October the squadron was joined by two Turkish corvettes, two Russian frigates and 16 small Turkish gunboats, arranged by Hood on a visit to Rhodes in Swiftsure the week before.James, p. 194 The gunboats were subsequently used to bombard Aboukir Castle and a French encampment at Lake Maadie on 25 October, although results were negligible. After the first day the Turkish crews were replaced with British sailors, but except for a complaint from the French that \\"unfair\\" incendiary weapons were used in the attack, nothing was achieved. The incendiary shells subsequently proved to have been taken from the captured Spartiate following the battle on 1 August and were found to be made of a substance that burned even under water. After three days the bombardment was abandoned and no further activity took place on the Egyptian coast during the remainder of the year. The Turkish and Russian vessels were eventually withdrawn in December, while Lion was detached to join the blockade of Malta.Clowes, p. 377 Ionian Sea The main Mediterranean fleets of the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire were deployed in the Ionian Sea. At the Treaty of Campo Formio, France had been awarded the Ionian Islands and the four fortresses of Butrinto, Parga, Preveza and Vonizza on the Albanian and Greek coasts.Gardiner, p. 58 In early October, following the declaration of war between France and the Ottomans, a large Turkish army had advanced across the Balkans and rapidly forced the fortresses to surrender. At the same time, the Ionian Islands were attacked by a joint Russian and Turkish expeditionary force, which included ten Russian ships of the line, numerous smaller Russian vessels and approximately 30 assorted Turkish ships. On board were 8,000 Turkish soldiers, which rapidly invaded and seized the islands of Paxi, Santa Maura, Theaki, Cephalonia, Zante and Cerigo, capturing 1,500 French prisoners by 10 October.James, p. 190 Only the large fortified island of Corfu held out, and there the defenders were forced back into the main town. Although the town was besieged, operations were slow and the blockade was only loosely enforced, allowing G√©n√©reux to successfully break out and reach Ancona. By the end of the year little had changed, the French garrison remaining besieged in Corfu.Clowes, p. 375 Malta and Naples Further westwards, the newly captured French island of Malta was under a much more diligent blockade. The returning convoy from Aboukir Bay under Saumarez reached Malta in September. There he encountered a squadron of four Portuguese ships of the line and the British ship Lion under the command of Tom√°s Xavier Teles de Castro da Gama, Marquess de Niza, initially sending them on to Alexandria.James, p. 188 While anchored off Malta awaiting favourable winds, a delegation of native Maltese citizens was brought on board Saumarez's ship Orion on 25 September. They announced that the Maltese people, infuriated with French disestablishment of the Roman Catholic Church on Malta, had risen up against the French garrison and were forcing them back towards the fortress of Valletta.Gardiner, p. 67 Saumarez attempted to negotiate the surrender of the island with Vaubois, but was rebuffed. Unable to delay his passage to Gibraltar any longer, Saumarez gave the Maltese 1,200 muskets and promised to send assistance as soon as he was able.Clowes, p. 374 By 12 October, the French were besieged in Valletta by 10,000 Maltese irregulars. Vaubois had only 3,000 healthy troops, although the arrival of Villeneuve with the ship of the line Guillaume Tell and two frigates did bolster his defences.James, p. 189 On the same day that the French retreated to Valletta, Nelson despatched the ships Alexander, Culloden, and Colossus from his squadron at Naples to blockade the port, under the command of Captain Alexander Ball. Although the Neapolitans refused to deploy forces to Malta, which was technically their territory, the squadron was joined within a few days by Niza's Portuguese ships and then by Nelson, now Lord Nelson, in Vanguard on 24 October. Four days later, Nelson authorised Ball to negotiate the surrender of the nearby island of Gozo. The French abandoned the island's fortifications and the British captured 24 cannon and 3,200 urgently required sacks of grain, which were distributed among the Maltese populace. With the French garrison trapped in Valletta, no further actions took place off Malta during the year, both sides settling in for a long siege. While his captains enforced the blockade of Malta and Alexandria during September and October, Nelson was anchored in the Bay of Naples, enjoying the hospitality of King Ferdinand and Queen Maria Carolina of the Kingdom of Naples. Arriving on 22 September, Vanguard was greeted with over 500 small vessels organised by the royal family and led by a barge carrying Sir William and Lady Emma Hamilton.Gardiner, p. 47 Over the next weeks, Nelson was taken into the court as an honoured guest, and has subsequently been accused of neglecting his naval responsibilities. It was at this time that his mutual attraction to Lady Emma Hamilton developed into a romantic affair. He also began to dabble in Neapolitan politics, successfully combining with Maria Carolina, the francophobe Queen, to encourage Ferdinand to go to war with France. Ferdinand ordered the Neapolitan army under General Mack to drive the French out of Rome.Bradford, p. 223 The resulting campaign was a disaster for the Neapolitans; the French counterattacked and forced Ferdinand and his court to flee to Palermo in Sicily. The French established the Parthenopean Republic in Naples to replace the monarchy. Spain and Menorca Capture of the Dorothea, 15 July 1798, alt=A two decked ship fires from both sides as it is surrounded by four smaller ships, three on one side and one on the other While Nelson was engaged in the Central and Eastern Mediterranean, the main Mediterranean Fleet under Earl St Vincent had ensured that the Spanish Navy was unable to intervene. On 24 May St Vincent was joined at the Tagus by a reinforcement of eight ships under Rear-Admiral Sir Roger Curtis, and the admiral ordered his ships to establish blockades off the southern Spanish ports, especially Cadiz, where the main Spanish fleet lay at anchor.James, p. 195 There regular correspondence passed between St Vincent and Admiral Don Joseph Massaredo, the Spanish commander. The Spanish fleet made no major deployments during the year, except for a single convoy of the ship of the line Monarca, two frigates and several merchant vessels that sailed in April. Although privateers and minor warships fought several small engagements along the Spanish Mediterranean coast, the only significant Spanish deployment of the remainder of the year was by a frigate squadron based at Cartagena, which was intercepted by the British ship of the line Lion. At the ensuing Action of 15 July 1798, the Spanish ships formed a line to meet the attack of Captain Dixon's ship but the damaged frigate Santa Dorotea fell behind the leading three frigates. As the leading ships returned to Catagena after a desultory long-range exchange of gunfire, Santa Dorotea was defeated and captured.Gardiner, p. 54 Once the French Mediterranean Fleet had been destroyed in Aboukir Bay, St Vincent was determined to restore British hegemony in the Mediterranean. To ensure this, his fleet needed a base with a well protected deep water harbour that could not be assaulted by land. The best island harbour in the Western Mediterranean was at Port Mahon on Menorca, where a large modern dockyard included a careening wharf, extensive storehouses and a purpose-built naval hospital. These facilities were all British in manufacture, constructed during periods of occupation by British forces between 1708 ‚Äì 1756 and 1763 ‚Äì 1781.Gardiner, p. 45 St Vincent therefore detached two ships of the line, three frigates and several smaller vessels and transports to the island under Commodore John Thomas Duckworth, carrying a small army under Colonel Charles Stuart.James, p. 196 The expeditionary force arrived off Menorca on 7 November and the troops were landed at Addaya Creek. There a Spanish attack was driven off and over the next two days the army continued inland, a detachment under Colonel Henry Paget seizing Port Mahon while the main army received the surrender of town after town, including Fournella, which overlooked the island's principal protected anchorage. On 11 November a Spanish squadron of four frigates attempted to disrupt operations, but a swift counterattack by Duckworth's ships drove them off. By 16 November the town of Ciudadella capitulated and control of the island was ceded to British forces.Clowes, p. 378 Notes References Bibliography      * * Category:Conflicts in 1798 ","title":"Mediterranean campaign of 1798"},{"id":"24513593","text":"II liga zapad is the second studio third by the Serbian punk rock band Atheist Rap, released by Hi-Fi Centar in 1998.

Originally a 1930s airport which was seized by the Germans during the Battle of France, it was used by the Luftwaffe, then by the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. After the war, the site was abandoned and is now agricultural fields. History Roye-Amy was a pre-World War II airport, with some support buildings, a hangar and grass runways. From September 24, 1939 until 19 May 1940 the RAF 57th BEF group used the airfield for Briston Blenheim I fast bombers, where they suffered heavy losses. German use during World War II The airfield was seized by the Germans during the Battle of France. It was not used by the Luftwaffe until May 1941, when Kampfgeschwader 1 (KG 1) was assigned with Junkers Ju 88 medium bombers, which carried out night attacks on England. The bombers remained until June when they were withdrawn. The Luftwaffe, 1933-45 During the occupation, the Germans constructed two 1700m concrete, all-weather runways, aligned 05/23 and 10/28. Presumably, this was due to the fortification of the Pas-de-Calais, being believed by the Germans that when the Americans and British tried to land in France to open a Second Front, the airfield would have a key role in the defense of France. In March 1944, Roye-Amy became a day interceptor airfield which housed fighters to attack the USAAF Eighth Air Force heavy bomber fleets attacking targets in Occupied Europe and Germany. Schnellkampfgeschwader 10 (SKG 10) flew Focke-Wulf Fw 190As from 9 March until 13 May 1944. Previously not attacked by Allied bombers, Roye-Amy came under attack by Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers and P-47 Thunderbolts mostly with 500-pound General-Purpose bombs; unguided rockets and .50 caliber machine gun sweeps when Eighth Air Force heavy bombers (B-17s, B-24s) were within interception range of the Luftwaffe aircraft assigned to the base. The attacks were timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the interceptors pinned down on the ground and be unable to attack the heavy bombers. Also, the P-51 Mustang fighter-escort groups of Eighth Air Force would drop down on their return to England and attack the base with a fighter sweep and attack any target of opportunity to be found at the airfield.Derived from information in USAAF Film \\"Target For Today\\" (available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkGL7vuC2A4) Unlike other Luftwaffe airfields in the area, Roye-Amy did not have any wooded areas in the vicinity for camouflage its aircraft servicing area or dispersement areas. The base was on flat, former agricultural fields and the Allied attacks caused considerable damage, destroying much of the base. American use American Ninth Army units moved through the area in early September 1944. On 6 September The IX Engineer Command 862d Engineer Aviation Battalion moved in and began a quick rehabilitation of the base so it could be used by American aircraft. It was declared operationally ready for Ninth Air Force combat units on 8 September, only a few days after its capture from German forces, being designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"A-73 Roye/Amy Airfield\\"IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields, Airfield Layout In addition to the airfield, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting.

Sandlin When the combat units moved out, Roye-Amy Airfield was closed and turned over to the French Air Ministry on 8 August 1945. Postwar In French control after the war, the airport sat abandoned for several years. There was much unexploded ordnance at the site which needed to be removed, as well as the wreckage of German and American aircraft. Many of the buildings at the base were destroyed by the war, and although some had been repaired by the American combat engineers, most were in ruins. There was no use for the prewar airport, and as a result, the Air Ministry sold the land, concrete runways, structures and all, out to farmers for agricultural use, sending in unexploded ordnance teams to remove the dangerous munitions. Today all of the concrete and structures of the former airport and wartime airfield have been removed, and the land used by agriculture. Faint outlines of the runways can be seen in aerial photography. Also, the remains of the technical support site, to the north of the airfield can be indirectly seen from the disturbances in the fields which indicate the outlines of some large buildings, probably hangars. The airfield was extensively bombed, and the craters left by the attacks were filled in, but are still evident on the landscape.

Much of Earth's land surface is just a few hundred million years old. In contrast, large areas of Mars are billions of years old. Some surface areas have been formed, eroded away, then covered over with new layers of rocks. Scientists believe that it used to have a dynamic surface, but then volcanic activity ceased and the atmosphere was stripped away. The Mariner 9 spacecraft in the 1970s photographed a feature that was called \\"White Rock.\\" It was thought that this feature could have been a salt deposit, but information from the instruments on Mars Global Surveyor demonstrated rather that it was probably volcanic ash or dust. Today, it is believed that White Rock represents an old rock layer that once filled the whole crater that it's in, but today it has since been mostly been eroded away.

The essay is about Homer's epic poem the Iliad and contains reflections on the conclusions one can draw from the epic regarding the nature of force in human affairs. Weil's work was first published in 1940 under the title L'Iliade ou le po√®me de la force in Les Cahiers du Sud. Cahiers has been described as the only significant literary magazine available in the French free zone when the essay was first released. The first English translation was done by Mary McCarthy and published in the New York-based journal politics in 1945. The essay has since been re-published many times. It is the only one of Weil's writings on ancient Greek literature which is commonly used in university courses on the Classics.Weil wrote about several other Greek works, principally Antigone, Prometheus Bound and Electra, but these writings have generally been regarded as too fragmentary and Christological for use in university studies. Synopsis Achilles, the most formidable warrior of the age, shown here with the fatal arrow wound he suffered during the siege of Troy. Weil introduces the central theme of her essay in the first three sentences: > The true hero, the true subject, the centre of the Iliad, is force. Force > employed by man, force that enslaves man, force before which man's flesh > shrinks away. In this work, at all times, the human spirit is shown as > modified by its relations with force, as swept away, blinded, by the very > force it imagined it could handle, as deformed by the weight of the force it > submits to. She proceeds to define force as that which turns anyone subjected to it into a thing ‚Äì at worst, into a corpse. Weil discusses the emotional and psychological violence one suffers if forced to submit to force even when not physically hurt, holding up the slave and the supplicant as examples. She goes on to say force is dangerous not just to the victim, but to whoever controls it, as it intoxicates, partly by numbing the senses of reason and pity. Force thus can turn even its possessor into a thing ‚Äì an unthinking automaton driven by rage or lust. The essay relates how the Iliad suggests that no one truly controls force; as everyone in the poem, even the mighty Achilles and Agamemnon, suffer at least briefly when the force of events turns against them. Weil says only by using force in moderation can one escape its ill effects, but that the restraint to do this is very rarely found, and is only a means of temporary escape from force's inevitable heft. The author offers a number of reasons why she considers the Iliad to be a work unsurpassed in the Western canon. She admires its honesty in describing the realities of war. She relates how the poem covers all the different types of human love ‚Äì the love between parents and children, fraternal love, the love between comrades and erotic love ‚Äì though the moments when love directly appears in the poem are very brief and act as counter points to the otherwise unrelenting tragedy and violence. Yet in the last few pages of her essay Weil states that the influence of love is always at work in the epic, in the ever present bitter tone that \\"proceeds from tenderness\\": \\"Justice and love, which have hardly any place in this study of extremes and of unjust acts of violence, nevertheless bathe the work in their light without ever becoming noticeable themselves, except as a kind of accent.\\" At the end of her essay Weil discusses the sense of equity in which the suffering of combatants from both sides, Trojan and Greek, of whatever rank or degree of heroism, are treated in the same bitter and unscornful way. Weil says this degree of equity was never equalled in any other Western work, though to some degree it was transmitted via the Attic tragedies, especially those of Aeschylus and Sophocles, to the Gospels. But since the Gospels Weil finds that very few authors have begun to approach this sense of universal compassion, though she picks out Shakespeare, Villon, Moli√®re, Cervantes and Racine as coming nearer than most in some of their work. Reception The New York Review of Books says the essay is one of Weil's most celebrated works. The Atlantic Monthly has written that, along with Rachel Bespaloff's On the Iliad, Weil's essay \\"remains the twentieth century's most beloved, tortured, and profound responses to the world's greatest and most disturbing poem.\\" Simone Petrement, a friend of Weil, wrote that the essay showed a new light in which the Iliad could be viewed. Whereas previously the Iliad had often been regarded as a stirring tale of heroic deeds, after the essay it could be seen as an accurate and compassionate depiction of how both victors and victims are harmed by the use of force. The essay contains several extracts from the epic which Weil translated herself from the original Greek; Petrement records how Weil took over half an hour per line, succeeding in capturing the sense of sympathy and compassion that pervades Homer's work better than any previous translator. Elizabeth Hardwick described the essay as \\"one of the most moving and original literary essays ever written.\\" The title of the first chapter of Piero Boitani's A New Sublime: Ten Timeless Lessons on the Classics, \\"The Poem of Strength and Pity,\\" echoes the title of Weil's essay, reflecting the lasting influence of her ideas in the contemporary scene.

He is credited as initiating the creation of the set of gardens around Heligan House that are now well known as the Lost Gardens of Heligan. Life Henry Hawkins Tremayne was born in 1741, the second son of John Tremayne and Grace Hawkins. He was baptized at St Ewe on 17 July 1741, and was educated at Blundell's School in Tiverton. He attended Balliol College of the University of Oxford, where he matriculated in May 1759 and graduated as a Bachelor of Arts in 1763. Like many second sons of landed families, he was destined for a career in the Church of England, where he was ordained as a deacon in 1766. He took up the post of curate at Lostwithiel. Henry's older brother Lewis died shortly after Henry's ordination, leaving Henry the unexpected role of heir to the Heligan estate. In 1767, he married Harriet, the daughter of John Hearle of Penryn, a former vice-warden of the stannaries. As a consequence, he inherited a third share of the extensive Hearle estates and mining industry. In 1808 a further inheritance brought him the Tremayne estates at Sydenham in Devon. Henry was active in local politics although, unlike his son and grandsons, he never became a member of Parliament. He was a Tory and was elected mayor of Penryn on several occasions. In 1791 he chaired a protest meeting of those involved in the pilchard fisheries. He was locally renowned for his charity: ‚Äòhis numerous tenantry knew him as their kindest and best friend‚Äô (West Briton, 20 Feb. 1829). Henry died at Heligan on 10 February 1829. His eldest son, John Hearle Tremayne, inherited an estate of more than in Devon and Cornwall, including Heligan. Heligan Henry aspired to create a great garden at Heligan. He started by planting protective shelter belts of conifers on the western and eastern boundaries of his planned extensive gardens. In 1785, he undertook a tour of southern England, visiting many of the significant gardens of the time, including those of Blenheim, Park Place, Stowe and Hestercombe. He removed the earlier parterres, and laid out the northern gardens, building walled gardens, greenhouses, and a pineapple pit. Two estate plans, dating respectively from 1777 and sometime before 1810, show the changes wrought to the Heligan estate during Henry's ownership. The first plan shows a predominantly parkland estate, with the site of today's Northern Gardens occupied by a field. The second plan shows the development of shelter belts of trees surrounding the gardens, and the main shape of the Northern Gardens, the Mellon Yard and the Flower Garden are all readily discernable.

Biography=Early life Born Mario Roberto √Ålvarez Elissamburu in 1913 in the City of Buenos Aires, to Juana Elissamburu and Jer√≥nimo √Ålvarez. He enrolled at the University of Buenos Aires School of Architecture in 1932, and graduated in 1936 with Gold Medal of Honours. He married Jorgelina Ortiz de Rozas, and they had two children. His first design was in 1937, a public building for the new Medical Center (Hospital Clinic) of the private San Mart√≠n Medical Group (located in Buenos Aires, in the northwestern suburb of San Mart√≠n). In 1938, he was awarded the Ader Scholarship by his alma mater's UBA Faculty of Exact Sciences allowing √Ålvarez to study and work in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, during which time he gained experience collaborating on various public housing and public hospital projects. Legacy Mario √Ålvarez legacy are his magnificent building designs, and his devoted dedication to train his architectural design apprentices, and his support to professional internshipsArchitecture & Design Internship Programs, sponsored by FADU Facultad de Arquitectura, Dise√±o y Urbanismo (Universidad de Buenos Aires) ~ http://www.fadu.uba.ar/ in his field in the City of Buenos Aires. Career He returned to Argentina in 1939 and was named Director of Architecture for the important Buenos Aires suburb of Avellaneda, in 1942. Joining colleagues Leonardo Kopiloff and Eduardo T. Santoro, he established MRA in 1947. The firm's first major contract would be in 1954 with their design for the municipal Teatro General San Mart√≠n, the largest center for the stage in Argentina. Its success upon completion in 1960 helped secure MRA the design for the adjoining Centro Cultural General San Mart√≠n, built between 1962 and 1970. Other notable projects of √Ålvarez's in subsequent years included the Hernandarias Subfluvial Tunnel (completed in 1969), the Col√≥n Opera House's labyrinthine production facilities (1972), the Buenos Aires headquarters for the state steel concern, Somisa (1977), the Salto Grande Dam (1979) and numerous office buildings, including the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange annex (1977) and the offices of IBM's Latin American division (1980). He also became a leading designer of residential and hotel properties in Punta del Este, a Uruguayan seaside city popular among Argentine vacationers. √Ålvarez was inducted into the American Institute of Architects as an honorary member in 1976.MRA+A: Estudio Though an economic crisis during the 1980s resulted in less demand for √Ålvarez's work, he donated his design for the non-profit Leloir Institute's new facilities (completed in 1983). Some of his best-known designs from this era include the Chacofi building, the Buenos Aires American Express offices (facing San Mart√≠n Plaza), and the Costa Galana Hotel (Mar del Plata). An economic recovery in the early 1990s resulted in a rush of landmark designs for MRA, including the Rosario Stock Exchange's new building, the Le Parc tower (completed in 1996, the tallest in Argentina until 2003), the Hilton Buenos Aires (1999) and Microsoft's Latin American headquarters (2000), numerous luxury high-rises in the Recoleta and Palermo sections of Buenos Aires, and others. Turning 90 in 2003, √Ålvarez's design for the redevelopment of the Northern District of Osaka, Japan earned him a First Prize at that year's competition. The Galicia Financial Group's new financial district headquarters, designed by MRA, attracted controversy, however, when it resulted in the demolition of a historic buildingLa Naci√≥n (2/19/2000) Much as he had done for the new Rosario branch of the Argentine National Bank in 1983, √Ålvarez struck a compromise by incorporating parts of the beaux-arts fa√ßade into the new design. Other notable recent designs include the new Taravella International Airport (C√≥rdoba) terminal, Torre Aqualina (Rosario), the new Proa Foundation cultural center building and the Bariloche Hilton, built into the mountain rock. He was named an Illustrious Citizen of Buenos Aires by the City Legislature in 2007. √Ålvarez died in Buenos Aires in 2011, nine days shy of his 98th birthday. He was interred in the Jard√≠n de Paz Cemetery, in Pilar.

In Brazilian folklore, there are a number of legends associated with the muiraquit√£, to which supernatural qualities are often attributed. Historical information The Muiraquit√£, a carved green frog-shaped stone, was used as an amulet by the Tapaj√≥s women to prevent disease and avoid infertility. Their popularity spread around the Lower Amazon Basin and through to the Caribbean, where Muiraquit√£s from the Amazon state in Brazil were found. \\"They must have been an object of exchange among elites,\\" says archaeologist Marcondes Lima da Costa, Federal University of Par√°. Fashion reached Europe in the eighteenth century when these amulets were taken to the Old Continent. It was believed that they prevented epilepsy and kidney stones. Today they are rare pieces that reach high prices at auctions. Legend The legend says that the amulet was offered as a gift by the Icamiaba female warriors to all those Indians who annually visited their camp at the river Nhamund√°. Once a year, during a ceremony dedicated to the moon, the Icamiaba received the Guacaris warriors with whom they mated. At midnight, they dived into the river and brought up a greenish clay in their hands, which they molded into various forms: frogs, turtles or other animals, and presented these to their loved ones. Some versions say that this ritual would take place in an enchanted lake named Jaci uaru√° (\\"mirror moon\\" in Old Tupi: √Æasy arug√ª√°). Retrieved from the bottom of the river and shaped by the women, the still soft clay hardened in contact with the elements. These objects were then strung on the strands of hair of their brides and used as amulets by their male warriors. To date, this amulet is considered a sacred object, believed to bring happiness and luck and also to cure almost all diseases. It is also found in Macuna√≠ma, a well-known and internationally renowned literary work by Mario de Andrade.

Diplomatic crisis of 2008‚Äì2010 Relations between the states began to sour in July 2008 when Switzerland arrested the Libyan leader's son, Hannibal Gaddafi, and daughter-in-law for allegedly beating their servants at a hotel. The two were detained for two days and released. Muammar al-Gaddafi retaliated against Switzerland \\"by shutting down local subsidiaries of Swiss companies Nestl√© and ABB in Libya, arresting two Swiss businessmen for supposed visa irregularities, canceling most commercial flights between the two countries and withdrawing about $5 billion from his Swiss bank accounts\\". To attempt to ease the tension between the countries and get the release of the two Swiss businessmen, Swiss President Hans-Rudolf Merz went to Tripoli in August 2009 to apologize for the arrests. This was criticized by the Swiss press and public, with numerous calls for his resignation. At the 35th G8 summit, Gaddafi publicly called for the dissolution of Switzerland, its territory to be divided among France, Italy and Germany.

In response, on 4 November Switzerland said it was suspending an agreement to normalize relations with Libya and five days later the Libyan government handed the men back to the embassy. On 12 November 2009, Libyan prosecutors charged them with visa irregularities, tax evasion and failing to respect rules governing companies working in Libya. On 30 November, a Libyan court sentenced each of them to 16-month jail terms. The two men were also fined 2,000 Libyan dinars (US$1,671) each. The Libyan government said the business men's case and that of Hannibal Gaddafi are not linked.Swiss businessmen jailed in Libya In February 2010, Hamdani's sentence was overturned by a Libyan appeal court, while G√∂ldi's sentence was reduced to four months.Libya appeal cuts jail term of Swiss businessman On 22 February, Libyan authorities demanded the surrender of G√∂ldi. Police surrounded the Swiss embassy and threatened to raid the building. A number of EU ambassadors entered the Swiss embassy to demonstrate solidarity with Switzerland.

Hamdani was allowed to leave Libya and returned to Switzerland on 24 February.Tages Anzeiger, 22 February 2010 G√∂ldi served his four-month prison sentence and was allowed to return home on 13 June 2010. The Swiss military drew up plans for a rescue operation to free the two hostages. Under the plan, Swiss commandos would infiltrate into Libya and break the men out of prison, possibly clashing with Libyan security forces in the process, and would then smuggle them out of the country. Multiple options for smuggling were considered. One idea was to smuggle them out of Libya aboard the ambassador's plane. Smuggling them across the border into Algeria was also considered, but the plan was dropped after the Algerian government demanded the extradition of Algerian dissidents living in Switzerland in exchange for its cooperation. Other plans called for exfiltrating them by sea on board a submarine, although it is unknown from where the Swiss government would procure a submarine, smuggle them south into Niger, and Tuareg guides were recruited, or fly them out aboard a small airplane. The option of hiring a private British security company to free the men was also considered. Swiss security forces reportedly came close twice to carrying out the operation. According to Swiss MP Jakob Buechler, head of the Swiss Parliament's Defense Committee the operation was imminent, and could have ended in a \\"total disaster\\".Switzerland considered sending special forces into Libya to rescue citizensPresident Doris Leuthard has said the Swiss authorities acted correctly in considering plans for a military operation to free two Swiss hostages detained in Libya In February 2010, the dispute with Switzerland spread, with Libya refusing to issue entry visas to nationals of any of the countries within the Schengen agreement, of which Switzerland is a part. This action was apparently taken in retaliation for Switzerland blacklisting 188 high-ranking officials from Libya by adding them to the Schengen Area visa blacklist, a move supported by some Schengen countries, but criticised by Italy as an abuse of the system. Italy is concerned about the effect this could have on its own diplomatic relationship with Libya, and especially on their combined efforts to stop illegal immigration from Africa into Europe. There was no official confirmation from Libya itself as to why they have taken this action. As a result of the ban foreign nationals from certain countries were not permitted entry into Libya at Tripoli airport, including eight Maltese citizens, one of whom was forced to wait for 20 hours before he was able to return home. In response, the European Commission criticised the actions, describing them as 'disproportionate', although no immediate 'tit-for-tat' response was announced.

To the north and east its land transitions in a narrow strip into the Gro√ües Moor.  Neighbouring settlements  The nearest other settlements are the Sassenburg village of Neudorf-Platendorf to the north, Westerbeck to the east, the town of Gifhorn to the south and the Gifhorn suburb of Gamsen to the west. The nearest cities are Wolfsburg to the east and Brunswick to the south.  History = Foundation  It was first mentioned officially in 1796 as Auf dem Triangel and initially belonged to the old municipality of Neudorf-Platendorf, from which it became independent in the 19th century.  Points of interest  Points of interest in Triangel include the Gutspark, in which there are hundreds of rhododendrons and the manor house (Herrenhaus) built in the style of an English country house, which today houses a branch of the Diakonisches Werk, a nationwide Christian charity. The station opened in 1894 by the Prussian state railways on the line from Brunswick to Uelzen) was once an imposing building. It has however been in private ownership for a long time and has been heavily modified.  Current administrative structure  Since 1974 Triangel has belonged to the municipality of Sassenburg.  Politics = Council  The council is an advisory body which is part of the political structure of Sassenburg. Councillors are expected, however, to hear all issues affecting the village, although the final decision over any measure resides with the Sassenburg council. The following parties are represented on the council: * SPD 3 seats * CDU 2 seats Following the local election in 2006 the SPD stepped down in favour of the CDU after more than 30 years as the strongest party in Triangel.  Council Chair  In 2006 SPD member, Beate Morgenstern-Ostlender took over chairmanship of the council from Dieter Fuhrmann (CDU). Previously Morgenstern-Ostlender was the deputy chairman. Following Morgenstern-Ostlender‚Äôs election as chairman, SPD politician Friederike Wolff von der Sahl has been elected as deputy.

It is based on the slab serif style of typewriters; however, unlike most true typewriter fonts, it is a proportional design: the characters do not all have the same width. American Typewriter is often used to suggest an old-fashioned or industrial image. It was originally released in cold type (photocomposition) before being released digitally. Like many ITC fonts, it has a range of four weights from light to bold (with matching italics) and separate condensed styles. Some releases do not have italics. In the history of typewriters, early typewriters were initially thought to be replacements for printing and so featured proportional fonts. Monospaced typefaces, those designed so every letter takes up the same amount of space, were a more practical alternative and soon replaced printing types. American Typewriter was by no means the first typeface to imitate typewriting. Foundry catalogs of the late nineteenth century were already offering them, and press manufacturers even made press-size ribbons so that letters looking as if they had been typed could be produced wholesale. In the original release, the A faces are identical to the regular ones, except for alternate versions of the following characters: &, $, R, e. Used in media From the 1983-84 season to the 1988-89 season, MotorWeek used the font for road tests, as well as the closing credits. Another prominent example is the CBS sitcom Young Sheldon, which uses it in its opening and closing credits, as well as its logo, and is it also used by Chuck Lorre in his vanity cards. It is also used in the famous I Love New York logo. The U.S. TV series The Office uses the font as its main logo. Tesco used the font for in-store signage between the late 1970s and mid-1990s. Office supplies retailer OfficeMax uses the font for its logo. macOS and iOS include the font (without italics), and some applications use it. The current TVOntario logo uses this font.

Gullies in Asimov Asimov contains many gullies. Martian gullies are small, incised networks of narrow channels and their associated downslope sediment deposits, found on the planet of Mars. They are named for their resemblance to terrestrial gullies. First discovered on images from Mars Global Surveyor, they occur on steep slopes, especially on the walls of craters. Usually, each gully has a dendritic alcove at its head, a fan-shaped apron at its base, and a single thread of incised channel linking the two, giving the whole gully an hourglass shape.Malin, M., Edgett, K. 2000. Evidence for recent groundwater seepage and surface runoff on Mars. Science 288, 2330‚Äì2335. They are believed to be relatively young because they have few, if any craters. A subclass of gullies is also found cut into the faces of sand dunes which themselves considered to be quite young. On the basis of their form, aspects, positions, and location amongst and apparent interaction with features thought to be rich in water ice, many researchers believed that the processes carving the gullies involve liquid water. However, this remains a topic of active research. As soon as gullies were discovered, researchers began to image many gullies over and over, looking for possible changes. By 2006, some changes were found.Malin, M., K. Edgett, L. Posiolova, S. McColley, E. Dobrea. 2006. Present-day impact cratering rate and contemporary gully activity on Mars. Science 314, 1573_1577. Later, with further analysis it was determined that the changes could have occurred by dry granular flows rather than being driven by flowing water.Kolb, et al. 2010. Investigating gully flow emplacement mechanisms using apex slopes. Icarus 2008, 132-142.McEwen, A. et al. 2007. A closer look at water-related geological activity on Mars.

With continued observations many more changes were found in Gasa Crater and others.NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \\"NASA orbiter finds new gully channel on Mars.\\" ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 22 March 2014. www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/03/140322094409.htm With more repeated observations, more and more changes have been found; since the changes occur in the winter and spring, experts are tending to believe that gullies were formed from dry ice. Before-and-after images demonstrated the timing of this activity coincided with seasonal carbon-dioxide frost and temperatures that would not have allowed for liquid water. When dry ice frost changes to a gas, it may lubricate dry material to flow especially on steep slopes.

It crosses the first Jura Mountain chain, as considered from the Swiss Plateau. Location The gorge covers a length of around 2 kilometres between Frinvillier (altitude: 517 m) and B√∂zingen, a suburb of Biel/Bienne (altitude 447 m). The Suze (river) flows deep in the gorge: originating in the Erguel valley near Saint-Imier and finally flowing to the Lake of Bienne. History The gorge is one of the rare natural crossings from the Swiss Plateau to the Jura mountains between Schaffhausen and Geneva. The area was already well colonised at the time of the Roman Empire: one of the main Roman roads from Rome led through Helvetii to Aventicum (Avenches). It continued through Morat, Chi√®tres and Kallnach to Solodorum (Solothurn) and Windisch, along the eastern part of the Seeland (lake land). Via Witzwil, a second road crossed the Seeland between the Lake of Neuch√¢tel and the lake of Morat. A spur road from Petinesca went through the steep gorge of Taubenloch, crossed the Jura through the Col de Pierre Pertuis pass, and lead to Augusta Raurica and what is now modern Germany along the Rhine. Origin of the name The name Taubenloch was found for the first time in a document dated 1532. Several versions as to its provenience are still being debated. *Daubenloch, from the German words Daube, meaning precipice or trench, and Loch, meaning hole or cavity. *Die Taube: according to local legend, a young man loved a young girl who was so beautiful, charming and gracious that her nickname was die Taube / fr. la Colombe (the dove). They wanted to get married, but she was chased away by the despotic Sire of nearby Rondch√¢tel and found a sorry escape from his clutches in throwing herself to death down the gorge. The gorge was henceforth called the Taubenlochschlucht (The Gorge of the Dove) in her memory. *Similar, but less romantic: (Taube), also meaning pigeon, in reference to birds which allegedly nested in the gorge. Hiking A private non-profit corporation was founded in 1889, La soci√©t√© d‚Äôexploitation des gorges du Taubenloch, for the only purpose of establishing a hiking path throughout the gorge. Since 1927, part of the Taubenlochschlucht is one of the protected natural sites in Switzerland. Transjurane T16 Traffic runs through either side of Taubenloch, route 18 (south) and route 6 (north). The \\"Transjurane\\" motorway project is expected to be finalised between 2025 and 2030, by following the route of the gorge and linking up what is now the E27.

History Athis was a World War II airfield constructed by the Germans in August 1944. Construction began in July 1944 and it consisted of grass runways and simple support services. It lay to the northeast of Athis village and to the southwest of Tours-sur-Marne. The base was on flat, former agricultural fields bordered to the north by woodland in which aircraft and services were concealed.

Publishing poetry by both black and white writers working, predominantly in English but also in Ndebele and Shona, it challenged divisions and created a new open field for expression in divergent poetic voices and styles. History and profile Two Tone was launched in 1954. The founders were Philippa Berlyn and Olive Robertson. While the magazine was published in association with the National Arts Foundation of RhodesiaNational Arts Council of Zimbabwe website and the University of Rhodesia's English Department the selection process was left to the journal's rotating board of editors, whose focus on \\"good writing,\\" \\"technical skill,\\" \\"stylistic innovation\\" and \\"authentic expression\\" provided a foundation for much of the groundbreaking new literature that exploded in Zimbabwe in the 1970. In 1976 Kizito Zhiradzigo Muchemwa became the editor-in-chief of the magazine, being the first black editor. The magazine folded in 1981. Content and themes Two Tone prioritised the author of the imagination rather than the revisionist historian or political revolutionary - a position which became increasing tenuous during the oppressive years of the Ian Smith regime. The magazine received scathing criticism from academics, political activist and many black poets who increasingly saw it as a \\"banal\\" and \\"pretentious outlet\\" for a closed minority of \\"White literati\\", whose \\"patronizing approach\\" to black writing supported the political status quo. The antagonism was only exacerbated by the publication of defensive editorials which argued that \\"separatism and elitism\\" create the assurances of liberty to \\"foster imaginative literature.\\" Despite the controversy, the journal's legacy is secured through the writing of seminal contemporary Zimbabwean poets such as D. F. Middleton, Julius Chingono, Charles Mungoshi, Bonus Zimunya, John Eppel and Patricia Schonstein, all of whom began their literary careers on the pages of Two Tone.

Table Mountain is an inverted valley, an elevated landform which follows the former contours of a river valley above level of the surrounding topography, rather than below it. It was created by lava flows which filled an ancient river bed. The resulting igneous rock resisted erosion better than the materials around it, leaving behind a sinuous rock formation elevated above the surrounding landscape. Geology Table Mountain is composed of Table Mountain Latite, which formed from potassium- rich lavas erupted from a center of volcanism near modern-day Sonora Pass around 10.4 million years ago. The lava flows followed the course of the ancestral Stanislaus River, filling the river valley. As the Sierra Nevada Mountains were uplifted, the softer sediments surrounding the flows were eroded away, leaving behind an inverted river valley. Although the formation stretches for miles and rises hundreds feet above the surrounding landscape, its width rarely exceeds a few hundred feet. Most outcrops on Table Mountain reveal flow-top breccias, while some outcrops show distinctive columnar jointing. The lava flow which covered the ancient river bed trapped auriferous, or gold-bearing, gravels beneath it, some of which have been accessed by mining operations dating back to the 1850s. Ecology A variety of flora and fauna are found on Table Mountain. In the spring, many wildflowers can be found atop the mountain including several species of lupine and the yellow mariposa lily, Calochortus luteus. Vernal pools form on the flat top after heavy winter and spring rains, providing habitat for many uncommon plant and animal species. The harsh conditions found on top of Table Mountain generally prevent invasive plants from surviving, resulting in a landscape which is composed primarily of native plants. White-throated swifts nest on the cliff faces that flank the mountain.

Biography  Coumont is the son and grandson of grocers. His grandmother ran a hotel in front of the train station in Huy, Belgium. As a child in Belgium, Coumont spent countless hours perched on a chair, watching his grandmother make bread. In 1977, after a voyage to the United States, where he was impressed by the success of Michel Gu√©rard, he abandoned his classical studies and enrolled in the Hotel School of Namur in Belgium. After graduating, Coumont worked in several highly regarded restaurants including Michel Gu√©rard (Eugenie Les Bains, France), Georges Blanc (Vonnas, France) and Jo√´l Robuchon (Paris, France). As a young chef in Brussels, Coumont could not find the right bread for his restaurant. Passionate about quality, he returned to his roots and opened a small bakery where he could knead flour, salt and water into the rustic loaves of his childhood. Coumont opened his bakery in rue Antoine Dansaert in Brussels in 1990, in those days an avant-garde quarter of Belgian fashion. He named his bakery ‚ÄúLe Pain Quotidien.‚Äù Brussels quickly took to the taste of this traditional bread. Alain evolved his offering to include simple salads and tartines, keeping bread the cornerstone of the menu. At a local flea market, Coumont found a long table where his guests could sit to eat together; it became Le Pain Quotidien's first communal table. Success was rapid and Coumont had numerous candidates who wanted to open other Le Pain Quotidien outlets. In the space of a few months, 10 locations opened in Brussels. Coumont then followed his dream to open restaurants in the United States. In 1997, Coumont opened his first store on 1131 Madison Avenue in New York City, which was an instant success. Shortly thereafter, he met a group of Belgian investors who backed his U.S. expansion plans. With this financial support, he opened several locations in New York City and later in Los Angeles. Today the company operates over 260 restaurants in 22 countries, with a workforce of over 5000 employees. Coumont currently serves as the company's chief creative officer.

It is a highly selective Sigma-1 Receptor (S1R) agonist. The S1R regulates key cellular processes relevant to neurodegenerative diseases, such as calcium homeostasis, cytoskeleton dynamics, restoring mitochondrial health and neurotrophic factor release. S1R is implicated in cellular differentiation, neuroplasticity, neuroprotection, and cognitive functioning of the brain. Pridopidine positively influences S1R regulated pathways across neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental indications, including protection against axonal and neuronal injury, restoring spine impairments, enhancing BDNF secretion and restoring mitochondrial function. Priodopine was previously thought to be a D2R antagonist but this was discovered to be incorrect. Pridopidine is in late-stage development by Prilenia Therapeutics. Previously it was owned by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries who acquired the rights to the product from its original developer NeuroSearch in 2012. Pridopidine is the first drug to show statistically significant effect on maintenance of functional capacity in HD, as measured by Total Functional Capacity (TFC). This effect was most prominent in early HD patients. While at low doses, Pridopidine affects S1R, at higher doses it interacts with other targets including dopamine D3, adrenergic Œ±2C and serotoninergic 5-HT1A, which are established therapeutic targets for Parkinson's Disease Levodopa Induced Dyskinesia (PD-LID). This is the likely mechanism for the clear effect seen in the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù non-human primate model for PD-LID ‚Äì the MPTP-Lesioned Macaques. This model is considered highly translatable to success in phase 2 clinical trials.

This convention is also applied to the words vampyric and vampyrism. In the fictional world of House of Night, a small percentage of the world's teenagers are changed into vampires when adolescent hormones trigger a strand of what is otherwise junk DNA.Cast, Marked, p. 23 The change from human to vampyre takes four years, during which time the adolescents, known as \\"fledglings,\\" must attend one of the \\"House of Night\\" boarding schools.Cast, Marked, p. 6 While there, they are required to take the Vampyre Sociology 101 course to learn the dangers they face.Cast, Marked, p. 102 If a fledgling is not in constant proximity to adult vampyres, the fledgling will die; so the fledglings rarely leave the school. About one in ten fledglings die anyway, since their bodies cannot tolerate the Change. For those who survive, there's a big reward: in the words of one of the authors, \\"Vampires are like Superman. They‚Äôre super- gorgeous. They‚Äôre super-talented. They‚Äôre super-men.\\" Vampyres are physically stronger than most adult humans, with accelerated reflexes, enhanced dexterity, life of more than five centuries, as well as heightened senses such as night vision. Cascia Hall.) Only vampyres and fledglings that have blue tattoos are not destroyed by sunlight, as in many vampire novels, but it is painful to them, so classes at the House of Night are held at night.Cast, Marked, p.51 Fledglings are marked by a sapphire blue crescent-shaped outline on their foreheads; when they become full-fledged vampires, this mark becomes solid and they receive more 'tattoos' which extend over their cheeks (these usually represent some personality aspect; for instance, Zoey's equestrian teacher, Lenobia, has tattoos that look like horses.) Zoey is the only fledgling to receive a filled-in mark and tattoos. As she defeats evil, her tattoos extend over her shoulders, down to her lower back, around her waist, down her arms and palms, and across her chest. Older fledglings and adult vampires need to drink small quantities of human blood, but House of Night vampires do not attack humans to get it, instead getting it from blood banks. The taking of blood is pleasurable for both human and vampire, comparable to (and better than) sex and a drug rush, and may lead to a strong emotional bond, called \\"Imprinting\\" between the two. When an imprint is broken, either through death, Imprinting of another, or mystical means, it causes major anguish between the vampire and human, like with Zoey and Heath. Zoey and her friends also face the usual teenage issues. Zoey keeps some secrets from her friends and gets in trouble with them, forcing her to consider the nature of friendship. Kristin Cast said that these moral dilemmas were included because \\"those are issues teenagers deal with... We're not afraid to discuss things that are actually happening.\\" As with many contemporary vampire novels, exploration of human nature and social commentary forms a subtext. and Tsi Sgili are taken from real Cherokee legends.Much of the Kalona myth was apparently made up by the authors, since it refers to events a thousand years ago in Oklahoma, and until 1830, the Cherokee lived not in Oklahoma but in the region of New Echota, Georgia Outside in the human world, the \\"People of Faith\\" is a fictional Protestant religion that is highly intolerant of anything else but their own beliefs. (In an interview, P.C. Cast said that she modeled the People of Faith on the worst fanatics of all religions, not just Protestantism.) Catholicism also plays an important role in the later novels, with the fledglings joining forces with Catholic nuns against Kalona. The religious ambiance gives House of Night a strong moral perspective as it is often enforced that Nyx gives vampyres and humans free will. This theme takes special prominence in Tempted, where Zoey discovers that, although she is the reincarnation of a woman created to love Kalona, she has the power to choose whether she will follow her previous incarnation's path or reject it.see e.g. Tempted, page 206 One of the characters dies because Zoey makes the wrong choice.Tempted, page 316 Also, in Burned, a Manichaen view of the Universe is presented, in which Good battles Evil: forces of Light combat forces of Darkness and characters must choose which side to be on. Also, the black and white bull are presented.Cast, Burned, p. 83-85 In Awakened, the theme of love is presented, in which love must battle Darkness, and life is really only, always, about love. The Benedictine Abbey, Tulsa (In real life, St. Joseph Monastery.) The Bulls As noted above, a black bull, known as Light, and a white bull, Darkness, are introduced in Burned. The bulls were not accepted into vampyre society because this was too masculine, and vampyre society is heavily matriarchal. Their counterintuitive colorings are said to signify that each possesses something that the other wants. The bulls often take a price, or a debt, from those who ask them for favors. When Stevie Rae accidentally calls the white bull forth, he answers her question, giving Stark passage to the Otherworld. In return, he drinks from her. When Stevie Rae calls the black bull forth to get rid of the white bull, the black bull makes her swear an oath that she will have a connection to Rephaim. It is noted by Aphrodite that if the white bull kills the black bull, the world will fall. The white bull has intervened many times in the series, always helping Neferet in her plans. He becomes her Consort, but his true plan is to destroy, and consume, the black bull. He will use anyone to do that, and destroy anyone as well. The setting In a blizzard similar to that described in Hunted, 14 inches of snow fell on Tulsa. This photo was taken about 100 yards from the route Zoey used to flee the House of Night. The series is set in Tulsa, in a small and reclusive part of Midtown. The House of Night campus is in the real life campus of Cascia Hall, and the climactic scene of the first book in the series takes place in the extensive gardens of the Philbrook Museum. Zoey sometimes sneaks off-campus to the elegant shops of nearby Utica Square, and several important confrontations take place in Utica Square's Starbucks coffee shop. Some of the novels' most dramatic scenes take place in a catacomb-like network of tunnels under downtown Tulsa built by bootleggers during Prohibition; though a few such tunnels do indeed exist, and can be visited,\\"Tasha Does Tulsa\\" blog telling how to tour the tunnels they are far less extensive than the tunnels described by Cast. The abandoned Art Deco train depot where the tunnels begin, however, is real and is slated to become a concert hall. The location of Aphrodite's parents' mansion, South 27th Place, is a real street, though the mansion itself is fictional. Though Aphrodite's father, Mr. LaFont, the very rich and old mayor of Tulsa, has a name similar to the former, very rich, mayor of Tulsa Bill LaFortune, his character is very different, and the author has stressed that her fictional mayor is indeed fictional. The Benedictine convent to which Zoey and her friends flee.Cast, Hunted, p. 289 is real; it is called St. Joseph Monastery. And the devastating ice storm through which they flee was based on a real ice storm that hit Tulsa in December 2007.P.C. Cast Blog, 6:08 p.m. comment The climactic scene in Tempted takes place far from Tulsa, on San Clemente Island near Venice, which in real life called Isola di San Clemente and is part of the small island around Venice. The church at which the Vampyre High Council meets was built in 1131. Much of Burned takes place on the Inner Hebrides island of Skye, in the palace of Sgiach, the Vampyre queen. According to Scottish tradition, Sgiach (usually spelled Sgathach) was a princess many centuries ago who ran the best warrior training school in Scotland. Princess Sgathach lived in Dunscaith Castle, which is today a ruin. Characters The following lists a number of the characters in House of Night. * Zoey Redbird: the main protagonist of the series. She has an affinity for all five elements (air, fire, water, earth, and spirit), and is the only High Priestess to have ever been given that magnitude of power by the Goddess Nyx. Zoey is also the youngest High Priestess in Vampyre history. * Neferet: Main antagonist and former High Priestess, now immortal Consort of Darkness and witch Queen of the Tsi Sgili. Neferet is initially introduced as a kind, loving mentor to Zoey, but is gradually revealed to be on the side of Darkness. * Aphrodite LaFont: Former \\"hag from hell\\" and Zoey's enemy in the first book. An Oracle and Prophetess, she gradually grows to trust Zoey and the rest of the nerd herd. * Stevie Rae Johnson: Zoey's best friend, and the first red Vampyre High Priestess in history. She also has an affinity for earth and is Rephaim's girlfriend later in the series. * Erin Bates: A fledgling and member of the nerd herd with an affinity for water before she left to be with the evil red fledgling Dallas. Her body eventually rejects the Change and she dies. * Shaunee Cole: A fledgling and member of the nerd herd with an affinity for fire. Girlfriend of Erik Night in Redeemed. * Damien Maslin: A fledgling, member of the nerd herd with an affinity for air and Jack's boyfriend. * Heath Luck: Zoey's human \\" almost-boyfriend\\", who can't seem to stay away despite her best efforts. Their Imprint breaks twice: once when Zoey Imprints with Loren Blake, and again when Heath is killed by Kalona. Part of Heath's soul later returns in Aurox, the Vessel created by Neferet. * Nyx: The Goddess of the Vampyres and former love of Kalona. Erebus is her Consort. * Erik Night: A former fledgling and Zoey's ex-boyfriend, now the Vampyre Tracker for Tulsa's House of Night. Erik has a talent for acting, and once won an international House of Night monologue competition. He and Shaunee later start seeing each other. * Kalona: Erebus's brother and the fallen immortal Guardian of Nyx. Father of Rephaim and the Raven Mockers. He was once a glorious winged immortal of Nyx as well as her warrior and lover, but he grew jealous of his brother and was eventually deceived by Darkness, and was thus cast from the Otherworld by Nyx, an act that broke her heart. His wings turned black after this, reflecting the taint of Darkness in his soul. * Darius: A Son of Erebus tasked with guarding Zoey. He later becomes Aphrodite's Warrior. * Loren Blake: The Vampyre Poet Laureate and a professor at the House of Night, he flirts with Zoey and later Imprints with her, but is revealed to be Neferet's lover and puppet. Neferet kills him in Chosen when he begins to show real concern for Zoey. * Kramisha: A red fledgling with a gift for poetry who is named Zoey's Poet Laureate. * Dragon Lankford: Anastasia's husband, the fencing instructor. * Anastasia Lankford: Dragon's wife, the Spells, and Rituals professor. * Sylvia Redbird: Zoey's grandmother, a Cherokee Wise Woman. She owns a lavender farm and is often on hand to give Zoey advice and reassurance in the fight against Darkness. * James Stark: A red Vampyre who becomes Zoey's Warrior and Guardian and also has an affinity for archery (he can't miss what he aims at). * Jack Twist: Damien's boyfriend and a member of the nerd herd, who has an unofficial affinity for technology. In Awakened, Neferet, needing a sacrifice for the white bull, chose Jack because he refused to revoke Nyx in favor of evil, and killed him, making it seem like an accident. * Rephaim: Kalona's eldest and favorite Raven Mocker son. Later he becomes Stevie Rae's boyfriend and in Awakened he gets a normal body, but because of the mistakes he made in the past, is he only normal by night. By day he is a raven. * Shaylin Ruede: A blind girl who is the first fledgling to be Marked red. When Erik Marks her, she is gifted with an affinity for True Sight, and later for water. * Nisroc: Kalona's second eldest son and second most evolved, took care of his brothers while Kalona and Rephaim were away. Adaptations=Film adaptation In November 2011, it was announced that the film rights to House of Night had been acquired by producer Samuel Hadida's production company, Davis Films, and will be distributed by Lionsgate. P.C. Cast also said through her live stream chat that she confirmed for five movies. Currently, an outline of the screenplay has been written. The authors, Kristin and P.C. Cast, have been unable to get in contact with the producer therefore there are no known future plans for the movies as of now. The current contract expires in the fall of 2020. Comic book adaptation P.C. Cast announced on her website that a graphic book adaptation of the House of Night series, titled House of Night: Legacy, would be published in monthly issues by Dark Horse Comics starting the November 9, 2011. The comic book spanned five issues, each relating to a different element. The action takes place between Marked and Betrayed concerning Zoey's struggle to become a good leader for the Dark Daughters. To help her learn, Nyx places five tests in her way, each dealing with a story from The Fledgling Handbook 101.

Goedecker-Ciolek, \\"The equipment made of hide and leather\\", Der Mann im Eis Band 1, Innsbruck, 1992, pp. 410‚Äì418 Examination of archaeological shoe finds Water-logged finds generally consist of loose components since the threads used to sew the objects together does not survive humid burial. A tracking system should be used for keeping the loose components in order throughout the analysis and conservation processes. For wet archaeological leather, the first step is cleaning gently in water with a small soft brush. Conservation is preferably performed after the documentation phase. Documentation consists of drawings and written notes, photographic records are less useful since blackish leather does not show fine detail well. The first step for the Goubitz notation registration is an exact tracing of the fragment‚Äôs outline, usually positioned grain side down, flesh side up. Then symbols that indicate the type of stitches and seams are drawn in their appropriate place inside the outline.O. Goubitz, Stepping Through Time, Zwolle, 2001. pp. 35‚Äì40 Sole constructions (the way in which the upper parts of the shoe is fixed to the sole),O. Goubitz, Stepping Through Time, Zwolle, 2001, p. 91-98 fastening method and ensembles of components from the same shoe as well as animal type, leather thickness, folds and creases should be noted. If present, decoration type and technique used should also be recorded.O. Goubitz, Stepping Through Time, Zwolle, 2001, p.41-55 Most archaeological recovered leather artifacts are parts of footwear and may be combined with wood, fibre or metal parts. The technical details such as shoe construction technique, fastening method and fashion elements are used to establish a typology for a specific find group. Shoe type indicates the kinds of footwear such as boots, shoes, pattens, overshoes, etcetera. Shoe style is the consistent combination of a fastening method, height, fashion and decoration elements on a significant quantity of recovered shoes. Style nomenclature based on find place's name has been partly established for Roman period finds.C. van Driel-Murray, 'Footwear in the North-Western Provinces of the Roman Empire',Stepping Through Time, Zwolle, 2001, pp. 362‚Äì327 Due to changes in fashion and the fact that shoes have a limited life span due to use, footwear is a chronologically sensitive material excavation and represents a closely dated chronological source for archeology. The find context, stratigraphic placement and other dating methods contribute to establishing a specific chronology. Further research for comparative parallel examples among the existing archaeological archives (collections, publications, reports) helps to define a relative chronology for the shoe types and styles.

He was born November 28, 1917, in Montreal, Canada and died there on September 6, 2009, of pneumonia. Early life Vianney D√©carie was a descendant of an old Quebec family. His grandfather, Barth√©l√©my Th√©lesphore D√©carie, was a major landowner, whose farms stretched through the west end of present-day Montreal and the village of Notre Dame de Grace. The D√©carie Expressway bears the family's name. Career At 17, he won the Prix Colin de Rh√©torique for the best marks in the province among the coll√®ges classiques, the religious-run preparatory schools in Quebec. By 1950, D√©carie earned his doctorate and, in 1954, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship. He studied all of St. Thomas Aquinas's writing on Aristotle at the Widener Library of Harvard University. The provincial government established the University of Montreal's √âcole normale sup√©rieure. In 1961, he was named director. The school offered a higher standard for teaching both university and high school instructors, and eventually became the university's faculty of education. His work called for a more robust post-secondary system: a research council, better peer review and a body to implement best practices for university administrators; all of which preceded the Parent Commission. He published L'object de la m√©taphysique selon Aristotle, one of the most important books on the philosopher. He obtained the Doctorat d'√âtat from La Sorbonne and was featured in the pages of Paris Match. He made enemies with his political writing and general exploration. There was still resistance to open-mindedness among the clergy who ran the university. A Le Devoir editorial criticized the university for not recognizing Pierre Trudeau's value; after D√©carie complained to the rector of the university, Trudeau was hired. D√©carie was an occasional writer for the political magazine Cit√© Libre. D√©carie also played a role in the early career of Charles Taylor, whom he hired as a professor in the early 1960s. International philosophers such as Paul Ricoeur, Paul Vignaux and Henri-Ir√©n√©e Marrou regularly spoke to his students. He was seen as an avant-garde Christians in 1960s philosophy.. He retired mandatorily at age 65. but continued to lecture, including at McGill University. He researched until two years before his death at age 91 when he suffered vascular dementia. Awards He was awarded the Order of Canada and the Order of Quebec, of the latter named a Grand Officer, for his work promoting secular education. Family His widow is Th√©r√®se Gouin D√©carie, a pioneering researcher on early childhood development. His children are Pascale, Dominique, Jean-Claude and Emmanuel. He went to church every Sunday, but respected his children's religious choices. His love of language was passionate, and was moved by the construction of ancient Greek words. That passion for language spilled over into a short-wave radio obsession, listening to foreign broadcasts.

Youth and beginning of career She began her voice training at age 16 at the Petah Tikva Conservatory, studying classical singing with singer and conductor Nili Harpaz. After her army service in the Israeli Air Force, she studied at the Beit Zvi Academy of Performing Arts in Ramat Gan, specializing in musical theatre with Dorit Atzmon. As part of her studies she appeared, among others, as Polly Peachum in the musical The Threepenny Opera by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill, as Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe and as the High Priestess in Hair by James Rado, Gerome Ragni and Galt MacDermot.

He was closely associated with Robert Maxwell, and was the centre of considerable UK media attention in 1991 after he was accused in Seymour Hersh's book The Samson Option of involvement in Israeli arms deals and of passing the location of Mordechai Vanunu to the Mossad. In response, Maxwell and Davies sued for libel, although Davies did not pursue the case and Mirror Group apologised and settled on behalf of Maxwell after his death. Journalistic career Davies began his career with the Birmingham Post and Mail, and joined Mirror Group Newspapers in 1961 as a foreign correspondent and investigative reporter. He served as foreign editor of the Daily Mirror for 14 years until he was sacked by Maxwell in 1991 at the age of 52. Davies later went on to publish stories of working with Maxwell, as well as books about the British Royal Family and Northern Ireland. Davies was first in the mass media to identify the victim of the 2007 royal blackmail plot, despite a court order preventing naming in the UK. He wrote a book on Maxwell entitled Death of a Tycoon: An Insider's Account of the Rise and Fall of Robert Maxwell. In it he speculated that Maxwell had been killed and suggested some unlikely culprits. He also detailed his own affair with Maxwell's secretary in his book The Unknown Maxwell. He was referred to as \\"Kite\\" by satirical magazine Private Eye because his stories were supposed to be \\"fliers\\". He has been confused with another British journalist of the same name when they were working in the same building. Arms sales Davies was named by Ari Ben-Menashe as his business partner in Profits of War, in relation to Iran‚ÄìContra and the sale of PROMIS, the first computer spyware. The arrangement was also noted in the book Robert Maxwell, Israel's Superspy: The Life and Murder of a Media Mogul by Gordon Thomas. Ben-Menashe later posted seven documents relating to sales of arms by Davies, sometimes signing himself as Davis. Ben-Menashe also stated Davies was a \\"major player\\" in the arms sales to Iran and made more than $1.5 million on one deal. Davies and Ben-Menashe were specifically business partners in the international arms firm Ora Limited, which operated out of Davies' home in London starting in 1983. Ora Limited was setup according to Ben-Menashe with approval of the Israeli government and was meant to facilitate the Israeli flow of arms to Iran during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. Davies' former wife, Janet Fielding, confirmed that Davies was selling arms in partnership with Ben-Menashe. In an interview with Seymour Hersh, she stated \\"Nick would try to tell me stuff [about the arms sales] and I said I didn't want to know. I left him because of it.\\" She also stated that she was aware that his arms sales partner Ben-Menashe was an Israeli intelligence operative. Personal life In a 1992 article for The Washington Post, Christopher Hitchens describes Davies as a \\"polo-playing friend of Prince Charles\\". Davies also had a friendship with Diana, Princess of Wales. From 1982 to 1991, he was married to the Australian actress Janet Fielding, best known for playing the Fourth and Fifth Doctor's companion Tegan Jovanka in Doctor Who. Davies lived in Brighton in 1993. There are some details of his personal life in his books The Unknown Maxwell and Death of a Tycoon: An Insider's Account of the Rise and Fall of Robert Maxwell.

American military operations other than war (MOOTW) focus on deterring war, resolving conflict, promoting peace, and supporting civil authorities in response to domestic crises. In United States military doctrine, military operations other than war includes the use of military capabilities across a range of operations that fall short of war. Because of political considerations, MOOTW operations normally have more restrictive rules of engagement (ROE) than in war. MOOTW not involving the use or threat of force include humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, arms control and peacekeeping. Fundamental principles Several fundamental principles can be adduced from military operations other than war: objective, unity of effort, security, restraint, perseverance, and legitimacy. The first three are derived from the principles of war, and the remaining three are MOOTW-specific. #Objective: The aim of MOOTW is to direct every military operation toward a clearly defined, decisive, and attainable objective. Inherent in the principle of objective is the need to understand what constitutes mission success, and what might cause the operation to be terminated before success is achieved. #Unity of Effort #Security: The goal here is to never permit hostile factions to acquire a military, political, or informational advantage. #Restraint: Judicious use of force is necessary, carefully balancing the need for security, the conduct of operations, and the political objective. Commanders at all levels must take proactive steps to ensure their personnel know and understand the ROE and are quickly informed of changes, otherwise it can result in fratricide, mission failure, and national embarrassment. ROE in MOOTW are generally more restrictive, detailed, and sensitive to political concerns than in war. #Perseverance: Some MOOTW may require years to achieve the desired results. #Legitimacy: The goal here is to have committed forces sustain the legitimacy of the operation and of the host government, where applicable. In MOOTW, legitimacy is a condition based on the perception by a specific audience of the legality, morality, or rightness of a set of actions. Types * Arms Control b39 * Combatting Terrorism: This includes antiterrorism and counterterrorism. Antiterrorism programs are defensive measures taken to reduce vulnerability to terrorist acts and form the foundation for effectively combatting terrorism. Counterterrorism is offensive measures taken to prevent, deter and respond to terrorism, which provides response measures that include preemptive, retaliatory, and rescue operations. * DOD Support to Counterdrug Operations * Enforcement of Sanctions and/or Maritime Security Operations (MSO), Maritime Intercept Operations, Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS) * Enforcing Exclusion Zones * Ensuring Freedom of Navigation and Overflight * Humanitarian Assistance: HA operations relieve or reduce the results of natural or manmade disasters or other endemic conditions such as human pain, disease, hunger, or privation in countries or regions outside the United States. * Military Support to Civil Authorities (MSCA): These operations can consist of temporary augmentation of air traffic controllers and postal workers during strikes, restoration of law and order after a riot, protection of life and federal property, or providing relief in the aftermath of natural disaster. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of federal military forces to enforce or otherwise execute laws unless expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress. Examples of MSCA are disaster relief provided during Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki in 1992, and deployment of troops during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. * Nation Assistance and/or Support to Counterinsurgency: * Security assistance refers to a group of programs by which the United States provides defense articles, military training, and other defense-related services to foreign nations by grant, loan, credit, or cash sales. * Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) * Peace Operations (PO): Military PO are categorized as peacekeeping operations (PKO) and peace enforcement operations (PEO). ::PKO are military operations undertaken with the consent of all major parties to a dispute, designed to monitor and facilitate implementation of an agreement and support diplomatic efforts to reach a long-term political settlement. PEO are the application of military force, or threat of its use, normally pursuant to international authorization, to compel compliance with resolutions or sanctions designed to maintain or restore peace and order. * Protection of Shipping: Protection of shipping includes coastal sea control, harbor defense, port security, countermine operations, and environmental defense. * Recovery Operations: Recovery operations are conducted to search for, locate, identify, rescue, and return personnel or human remains, sensitive equipment, or items critical to national security. * Show of Force Operations: These operations involve increased visibility of US deployed forces in an attempt to defuse a specific situation. * Strikes and Raids: Strikes are offensive operations conducted to inflict damage on, seize, or destroy an objective for political purposes. Strikes may be used for punishing offending nations or groups, upholding international law, or preventing those nations or groups from launching their own offensive actions. A raid is usually a small-scale operation involving swift penetration of hostile territory to secure information, confuse the enemy, or destroy installations. It ends with a planned withdrawal upon completion of the assigned mission. * Support to Insurgency: US forces may provide logistic and training support to an insurgency, but normally do not themselves conduct combat operations. -Peacekeeping -Contingency Operations -Non-combatant Evacuation Operations, or NEOs -Combat terrorism -Aid host nations through security assistance -Enforce United Nations economic sanctions -Intercept vessels -Plan and execute disaster relief, humanitarian assistance, and civil support operations -Conduct public health operations -Assist interagency counter-drug operations -Show the flag.

He represented Sri Lanka in The UN Committee Against Torture in 2011 in which he said that the Sri Lankan government has received intelligence information that missing lankaenews cartoonist Prageeth Ekneligoda is living in a foreign country. However he concurred that he lied when he was summoned by a local court.http://blog.srilankacampaign.org/2012/06/former-attorney-general- testifies-in.html Chief justice Peiris was nominated to be Chief Justice by President Mahinda Rajapaksa following the controversial impeachment of Shirani Bandaranayake. The Parliamentary Council gave its approval for Peiris's appointment on 15 January 2013. Peiris was sworn in as chief justice on 15 January 2013. Peiris was officially inaugurated as chief justice at a ceremony in the Supreme Court on 23 January 2013. The media, other than the state-owned media, were banned from the ceremony which was boycotted by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL), the largest lawyers association in the country. The ceremony was however attended by other judges including the associate judges of the Supreme Court. Peiris' appointment drew some criticism. Peiris is considered to be an ally of President Rajapaksa and his appointment was seen by critics as further consolidation of power by the president and his family. United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay expressed doubts about Peiris' independence and impartiality, particularly when dealing with allegations of serious human rights violations by the Sri Lankan government. The International Commission of Jurists condemned Peiris' appointment, describing it as a \\"further assault on the independence of the judiciary\\". Maithripala Sirisena the President elected on 8 January 2015 refused to take oaths before him on the basis his appointment was illegal and took oaths before Justice Hon. K. Sripavan the most senior Judge of the Supreme Court. According Sirisena Mohan Peiris visited him several times begging not to remove him and promising to deliver judgements according to his wishes. On 28 January 2015, the Government of Sri Lanka acknowledged that the appointment of 44 Mohan Peiris as the Chief Justice was void at its inception as Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake was not impeached lawfully and therefore no vacancy existed for the post of Chief Justice. The paved way for Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake to resume duties as the Chief Justice of Sri Lanka. Family Peiris's wife Priyanthi is also an attorney-at-law. Their teenage daughter Talia died in July 2002. Peiris is a Roman Catholic and is a worshipper at All Saints‚Äô Church, Borella.

Life He was the eleventh and youngest son of Sir Richard Bulkeley of Beaumaris and Cheadle, but the eldest by his second wife, Agnes, daughter of Thomas Needham of Stenton. He was thus half-brother of Sir Richard Bulkeley. His parents marriage was unhappy: his mother was unfaithful to his father, and his sudden death led to an accusation by his brother that she had murdered him (she was tried for murder but acquitted). He entered at the beginning of 1587, as a commoner, Brasenose College, Oxford, where he proceeded B.A.; he afterwards moved to St. Edmund Hall, where he took his M.A. degree in 1593. On 13 November of the same year he was ordained deacon by Hugh Bellot, bishop of Bangor. Some years later he became Archdeacon of Dublin, and he was promoted to its see in 1619. Subsequently, he was named by James I a member of the Privy Council. He revived the controversy regarding the primacy of Ireland, and on the question being submitted to Thomas Wentworth, Lord Deputy of Ireland, the precedency was given to the Archbishop of Armagh. At Christmas 1628 he was involved in an unsuccessful attempt to prohibit the public celebration of the Roman Catholic Mass. When the news reached the city there was a large scale riot, and a mob stoned Bulkeley, who had to seek refuge in a private house; to his outrage, Dublin Corporation refused to take any steps to assist him and refused entry to the town to the troops sent by the Crown to quell the riot. Bulkeley was one of the Council who in 1646 issued a proclamation confirming the peace treaty concluded in that month between the Marquis of Ormonde and the Roman Catholics. On 8 March 1649 it was decreed that all honours, castles, etc. belonging to the archbishopric of Dublin should be vested in General Henry Ireton, president of Munster, and Bulkeley was committed to prison for resisting the act passed by the English Parliament in 1647, prohibiting the use of the Book of Common Prayer. The archbishop died at Tallaght on 8 September 1650, in his eighty-second year, and was buried in St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin under the communion-table. He was the author of a pamphlet, Proposals for sending back the Nobility and Gentry of Ireland. Marriage & children By his wife Alice, daughter of Roland Bulkeley of Conwy, he had at least seven children: William (Archdeacon of Dublin), Richard, Margaret, Alice, Dorothy, Mary and Grizel. William was the father of Sir Richard Bulkeley, 1st Baronet.

History The station was named Crank railway station from its opening for passengers on 1 February 1858 until 9 September 1940 when it was renamed Crank Halt. The station was operated by the St Helens Railway, LNWR, the London Midland and Scottish Railway from 1923 and finally British Railways (London Midland Region) until it closed in 1951 for scheduled passenger services. However, the line remained open for goods services and for passenger excursions and diversions up until 1964. Location and facilities 1911 map of the Ormskirk to St Helens area showing the location of Crank station, lower centre right The station was located at the foot of the hill up to the village just east of the level crossing with the minor road from St Helens to Crank which later became the B5201. It had distinctive wooden buildings on each platform with curved overhanging roofs to provide protection from inclement weather. Some other stations on the line had buildings of the same pattern. Services In July 1922 thirteen \\"Up\\" (southbound) trains called at the station on weekdays, with an extra on Saturday evenings. All originated at Ormskirk, several with connections from Southport. Ten Up trains called on Sundays. All trains continued all stations to St Helens. The \\"Down\\" (northbound) service was similar. The trains all consisted of \\"Motor Cars ‚Äì One class only\\". Please note that 'Motor Cars' then did not have their modern meaning, but consisted of a single railway coach joined to a dedicated steam locomotive. Their generic type is summarised in L&YR; railmotors. Photographs appear in Bob Pixton's work on the line. In 1951 the Up service consisted of five trains on weekdays with three extra on Saturdays, all stations to St Helens. The rolling stock was \\"Third Class Only\\". No trains called on Sundays. The Down service was similar. All local trains plying between Ormskirk and St Helens called at Rainford Junction, entailing a reverse. None used the 'direct line' between Bushey Lane Junction and Randle Junction which formed the third side of the triangle shown near the top of the route diagram. That stretch was the preserve of goods trains, diversions and occasional specials. Private sidings Crank Colliery had its own private siding which left the line immediately south of the halt. The colliery company was wound up on 30 January 1880 and the colliery was dismantled. No trace can be seen in the 6\\" OS Map surveyed in 1892.

History Vernon Scarborough founded Carolina Foods in Charlotte in 1934 as a sandwich company that expanded after World War II. Operating out of his basement, Scarborough made lunches for workers at local textile and furniture factories. Gradually, he introduced honey buns as complementary product. Following the war, the company expanded to its first location on South Boulevard in South Charlotte, where it expanded its confectionery offerings to doughnuts and pies, in addition to the growing popularity of its honey buns. Carolina Foods has expanded into a 100,000 square foot plant. It employs 425 people and produces 1 million honey buns per day, in addition to its other products, which include the Duchess brand doughnuts and Dunkin Sticks. It was the top \\"snack food\\" brand in Puerto Rico in 2014 according to the company's president. In an interview, the current president claimed that revenues doubled between 2009 and 2014. At the same time, increasing sugar prices hurt the company's profitability. Nutrition Carolina Foods acknowledged shifting consumer preferences toward healthier snacks in 2014.

The regiment was first in action in the Mysore Campaign during the Third Anglo-Mysore War, quickly followed by the Battle of Seedaseer and the Battle of Seringapatam in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War. Their next action was at Beni Boo Ali against pirates in Eastern Arabia and the Persian Gulf region led the East India Company to carry out a punitive expedition in 1819 to Ras al Khaimah which destroyed the pirate base and removed the threat from the Persian Gulf. In 1848, the regiment took part in the Siege of Multan and the Battle of Gujrat in the Second Anglo-Sikh War. The 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia was next for the regiment. This was a punitive expedition carried out by armed forces of the British Empire against the Emperor Tewodros II of Ethiopia, he had imprisoned several missionaries and two representatives of the British government.Harold G.

Function SPCA is found primarily in the membranes of the golgi apparatus in increasing concentrations from the cis- to the trans-golgi compartments. Following a calcium spike, SPCA proteins are responsible for transporting Ca2+ ions from the cytosol to the lumen of the golgi, thus lowering the cytoplasmic concentrations of Ca2+ to resting levels. SPCA is also able to transport Mn2+ ions into the golgi with high affinity, an ability that the related Ca2+-ATPase, SERCA, does not possess. Since Mn2+ ions are not used for signalling like Ca2+ ions are, the main reason for transporting them out of the cytosol is to prevent manganese toxicity. The removal of these ions from the cytosol can also be looked upon as supplying the golgi apparatus and thus the entire secretory pathway with these ions. Several proteins within the pathway require either Ca2+ ions, Mn2+ ions, or divalent ions to function as metal cofactors, such as aminopeptidase P, Proprotein convertases and sulfotransferases.

It exhibits highly Lambertian behavior, and can be machined into a wide variety of shapes for the construction of optical components such as calibration targets, integrating spheres, and optical pump cavities for lasers.  Characteristics  thumb300pxReflectance spectrum of SpectralonKokaly, R.F., Skidmore, A.K., Plant phenolics and absorption features in vegetation reflectance spectra near 1.66 ÔøΩm. Int. J. Appl. Earth Observ. Geoinf. (2015), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2015.01.010 Spectralon's reflectance is generally >99% over a range from 400 to 1500 nm and >95% from 250 to 2500 nm., however grades are available with added carbon to achieve various gray levels.Techniques and Applications of Hyperspectral Image Analysis By Paul Geladi - John Wiley & Sons Inc. 2007 Page 133 The material consists of PTFE powder that has been compressed into solid forms and sintered for stability, with approx. 40% void volume to enhance scattering of light. Surface or subsurface contamination may lower the reflectance at the extreme upper and lower ends of the spectral range. The material is also highly lambertian at wavelengths from 257 nm to 10,600 nm, although reflectivity decreases at wavelengths beyond the near infrared. Spectralon exhibits absorbances at 2800 nm, then absorbs strongly (<20% reflectance) from 5400 to 8000 nm. Although the high diffuse reflectance allows efficient laser pumping, the material has a fairly low damage threshold of 4 joules per square centimeter, limiting its use to lower-powered systems. The Lambertian reflectance arises from the material's surface and immediate subsurface structure. The porous network of thermoplastic produces multiple reflections in the first few tenths of a millimeter. Spectralon can partially depolarize the light it reflects, but this effect decreases at high incidence angles.Optical system design By Robert Edward Fischer, Biljana Tadic-Galeb, Paul R. Yoder - McGraw-Hill 2008 Page 534 Although it is extremely hydrophobic, this open structure readily absorbs non- polar solvents, greases and oils. Impurities are difficult to remove from Spectralon; thus, the material should be kept free from contaminants to maintain its reflectance properties. The material has a hardness roughly equal to that of high-density polyethylene and is thermally stable to > 350 ¬∞C. It is chemically inert to all but the most powerful bases such as sodium amide and organo-sodium or lithium compounds. The material is extremely hydrophobic. Gross contamination of the material or marring of the optical surface can be remedied by sanding under a stream of running water.http://www.systems- eng.co.jp/products/refrector/img/spectralon_e.pdf This surface refinishing both restores the original topography of the surface and returns the material to its original reflectance. Weathering tests on the material show no damage upon exposure to atmospheric UV flux. The material shows no sign of optical or physical degradation after long-term immersion testing in sea water.  Applications  Three grades of Spectralon reflectance material are available: optical grade, laser grade and space grade. Optical-grade Spectralon is characterized by a high reflectance and Lambertian behavior and is primarily used as a reference standard or target for calibration of spectrophotometers. Laser-grade Spectralon offers the same physical characteristics as optical- grade material but is a different formulation of resin that gives enhanced performance when used in laser pump cavities. Spectralon is used in a variety of \\"side pumped\\" lasers. Space-grade Spectralon combines high reflectance with an extremely lambertian reflectance profile and is used for terrestrial remote sensing applications. Spectralon's optical properties make it ideal as a reference surface in remote sensing and spectroscopy. For instance, it is used to obtain leaf reflectance and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) in the laboratory. It can also be applied to obtain vegetation fluorescence using the Fraunhofer lines. Basically Spectralon allows removing the contributions in the emitted light that are not directly linked to the surface (leaf) properties but to geometrical factors. History Spectralon was developed by Labsphere and has been available since 1986.

Early life Krause was born in the Buenos Aires Province town of Chivilcoy to Leopoldina and Carl August Krause, both German Argentine immigrants arrived in 1851. Tending his farm with implements he brought from Germany, Carl Krause instilled an interest in machinery to his five children, though the family eventually relocated to Buenos Aires in 1870. Otto subsequently finished his secondary school studies at the prestigious Buenos Aires National College, a public college preparatory school.Todo Argentina: Otto Krause  Engineer and educator  He enrolled at the University of Buenos Aires School of Exact Sciences in 1874, though he enlisted in the Argentine Navy as an engineer's assistant later that year. He returned to civilian life in 1878 and obtained a degree in civil engineering, earning a post in the Buenos Aires Teachers' School. Krause then began a career in the Argentine railways, working in the planning department of the Buenos Aires Western Railway in 1879 and later contributing to the lines' extension into then-remote Tucum√°n and Salta Provinces. Returning to Buenos Aires in 1882, Krause held technical positions at the 11th of September Station, then the site of a large railyard. He continued to teach the discipline, and in 1887 was commissioned to select material in Europe for the new rail line and facilities to serve the recently founded city of La Plata. The experience earned him a post of technical director of the new mail train established by president Miguel Ju√°rez Celman in 1888, and he became a tenured full professor at the University of Buenos Aires in 1891. Addressing the rapidly growing country's lack of formal technical schools, he established Argentina's first on March 15, 1897, and two years later, President Julio Roca re-chartered the institution as the National Industrial School, entitling it to public funds.Escuela T√©cnica Otto Krause: Historia Krause divided his time between the management of the school and diverse public posts, including that of President of the Municipal Tax Court and inspector of mines in the far-western San Juan Province. He continued to teach at his alma mater, as well, and in 1906 was named Dean of the School of Exact Sciences at the university. His efforts on behalf of technical schools included the 1909 inaugural of a new, important building for the National Industrial School in Buenos Aires' San Telmo area (just south of downtown), as well as the establishment of affiliates in La Plata, Rosario, Santa Fe and his hometown, Chivilcoy, among others. Krause helped plan irrigation works for the R√≠o Negro valley in semi- arid Patagonia before retiring in 1911. He returned in advisory capacity to the University of Buenos Aires in 1919, but died the following February at age 63; the National Industrial School was subsequently renamed the Otto Krause Technical School.

In March 1945, plans were made for an assault on Rangoon, the capital of Burma, as a stepping-stone on the way to recapturing Malaya and Singapore. Initial plans for the assault on the city had called for a purely land-based approach by British Fourteenth Army, but concerns about heavy Japanese resistance led to this being modified with the addition of a joint amphibious-airborne assault. This assault, led by 26th Indian Division, would sail up the Rangoon River, but before it could do so, the river would have to be cleared of Japanese and British mines. In order to achieve this, coastal defences along the river would have to be neutralized, including a battery at Elephant Point. This task was given to 44th Indian Airborne Division, but the division was in the middle of a reorganization, and as such a composite battalion was formed from two Gurkha parachute battalions. The battalion assembled and then trained throughout April, and then early in the morning of 1 May was dropped near Elephant Point. As it advanced towards the battery one of the battalion's companies was attacked by American bombers, causing a number of casualties. Despite this, and torrential rain, the battalion successfully assaulted Elephant Point and neutralized the battery there after a fierce firefight. It remained around Elephant Point until 2 May, when 26th Indian Division conducted its amphibious assault and secured Rangoon. Background On 22 March, as the joint battles of Meiktila and Mandalay were drawing to a close, a conference was held at Monywa in Burma, attended by senior Allied military figures including Admiral Lord Mountbatten, the commander in chief of the Allied South East Asia Command, and General William Slim, commander of Fourteenth Army. The object of the conference was to discuss future Allied strategy in South East Asia in the aftermath of Meiktila and Mandalay, including the reconquest of Burma and the retaking of Malaya and then Singapore. In order to secure these objectives however, Rangoon, the capital of Burma, would have to be captured before the onset of the monsoon rains, which would impede any Allied advance over land; the Allied Chiefs of Staff worked on the assumption that this would occur before June.Allen, p. 459 After Rangoon had fallen, a force of between four and five divisions would be landed in Western Malaya in an operation code-named Zipper, which would itself be followed by Mailfist, the capture of Singapore.Allen, p. 460 To accommodate all of these goals, Mountbatten insisted that Rangoon be taken by May. Slim had initially planned to take the city in a pincer movement, with XXXIII Corps advancing towards the city down the east bank of the Irrawaddy river via Hlegu, and IV Corps taking a shorter route along the Sittang River valley to the east. Slim believed that the Japanese had insufficient forces to block both thrusts, and one of the corps would therefore be able to capture Rangoon. However, Mountbatten was unsure that a purely overland advance would be successful, and that a joint airborne-amphibious assault would therefore be the better option. Slim and others, such as Slim's superior, General Oliver Leese (commander of Allied Land Forces, South East Asia), initially opposed such an operation, fearing that it would divert vital resources from Fourteenth Army. By the time of the meeting at Monywa, however, Slim had come around to Mountbatten's way of thinking, fearing that a purely overland advance would meet fierce Japanese resistance, as it had at Meiktila, and be delayed at the end of an overextended supply line. As such, a combined airborne and amphibious assault would be ideal as Fourteenth Army neared Rangoon, Slim arguing that it would be \\"a hammering at the back door while I burst in at the front.\\"Allen, p. 461 On 2 April orders were issued for the operation to go ahead, with the proviso that Rangoon be in Allied hands by 5 May at the latest.Latimer, pp. 407‚Äì409 Planning The joint operation was christened Dracula, and its schedule was decided by the Royal Navy, under the command of Admiral Arthur Power, who was responsible for the amphibious portion of the assault on Rangoon. Several problems had to be overcome during the planning for the operation. The first, and the least likely, was that the amphibious assault would be intercepted by elements of the Imperial Japanese Navy as it neared Rangoon.Allen, p. 467 To ensure that the amphibious elements would remain unmolested, 21 Carrier Squadron, commanded by Commodore G.N. Oliver was attached to provide fight cover for the landings; the squadron consisted of four escort carriers, two cruisers and four destroyers. Operating further out would be 3rd Battle Squadron, commanded by Vice Admiral Walker, which was formed of two battleships, and the Free French battleship Richelieu, as well another two escort carriers, four cruisers and six destroyers. Two days prior to Dracula taking place, this \\"massive naval screen\\" bombed several ports and airfields, and also engaged a Japanese troop convoy transporting more than one thousand Japanese troops to nearby Moulmein, sinking all the vessels. The Royal Air Force would provide support in the form of two RAF long-range fighter Wings, and the United States Army Air Forces with eight B-24 Liberator and four B-25 Mitchell bomber squadrons. More of a concern to Dracula's planners, however, were the land-based threats to the landing craft carrying the assault troops of 26th Indian Division. Air support was deemed to be vital to the operation's success, and a number of Japanese airfields around Toungoo were captured in the days leading up to Dracula.Allen, p. 468 There was also the problem of the defences in and around the River Rangoon, up which the landing craft were to sail. The river itself was heavily mined, a result of Japanese defensive measures as well as RAF offensive operations earlier in the conflict, and it would have to be swept and cleared of mines before any amphibious assault could take place. Before this could occur, however, the coastal defences along the banks of the river would have to be neutralized; a particular worry was the presence of an artillery battery at Elephant Point on the west bank of the river. The geography of the area ensured that the battery could not be destroyed through artillery bombardment or airstrikes, and weather conditions precluded an early amphibious assault.Tugwell, p. 284 As such, it was decided that a day before Dracula began on 2 May, a parachute battalion would be dropped near Elephant Point with the task of assaulting and destroying the battery.Harclerode, p. 639 Indian paratroops waiting to jump over Rangoon, Burma, 1945. The task was given to 44th Indian Airborne Division, but this presented several problems. The division was in the middle of a reorganization, and many of its officers were on leave, as were two Gurkha airborne battalions; another, the 3rd Gurkha Parachute Battalion, was about to transfer to 77th Indian Parachute Brigade. With no one unit available, a composite force was put together for the operation. The Headquarters Company was formed of men from 2nd and 3rd Gurkha Parachute Battalions, and each battalion provided a further two companies ‚Äì A and B from 2nd Gurkha Parachute Battalion and C and D from 3rd Gurkha Parachute Battalion. A mortar platoon and machine gun platoon augmented the ad hoc formation.Harclerode, pp. 639‚Äì640 The battalion was formed in early April, and came under the command of Major Jack Newland. After its initial formation it transferred to Chaklala, where its strength was augmented by Field Ambulance and Indian Engineers sections and it undertook training for the operation. When was this was completed it was transported to Midnapore, where for ten days it assembled its equipment and conducted a rehearsal exercise. Finally, on 29 April it was flown to Akyab on the Burmese coast, approximately 200 miles north of Rangoon, and was soon joined by a 200-strong reserve force formed of men from both Gurkha battalions and the 152nd Indian Parachute Battalion.Harclerode, p. 640 The battalion would be transported in 40 C-47 Skytrain transport aircraft belonging to 1st and 2nd United States Air Commando Group. Battle Men of the 15th Indian Corps land near Elephant Point at the beginning of operation \\"Dracula\\", 2 May 1945 At 02:30 on 1 May, a C-47 of 317 Tactical Control Squadron USAAF departed for Rangoon carrying a twenty-man pathfinder team, followed by a CCG plane carrying a pair of VCP, to mark and defend the landing zone at Tawhai. The rest of the composite battalion boarded thirty-eight Dakotas and took off thirty minutes later, and at 05:45 jumped over the drop zone; there were only a few casualties, one being a medical officer attached to the battalion. It encountered no Japanese opposition, and after it had rallied, advanced towards Elephant Point and the artillery battery. It halted 3,000 yards in front of the battery to allow B-24 Liberators from the USAAF to carry out a preliminary bombing attack on the battery. Unfortunately, despite officers and other ranks wearing yellow recognition panels and carrying orange umbrellas to identify themselves, C Company was bombed and strafed by the bombers, causing a number of casualties.Sources disagree on the exact number of casualties. Allen (p. 479) states that 'over thirty casualties' were caused, whilst both Tugwell (p. 284) and Latimer (p. 414) give the figure of 'forty casualties.' Harclerode (p. 640) provides the exact figures of fifteen killed and thirty wounded. As a result, a Forward Air Controller attached to the battalion ordered a halt to all further bombing runs on the battery. After moving through torrential rain,Allen, p. 479 the battalion reached Elephant Point at 16:00, and close- quarters fighting then took place, with flame-throwers being used against several Japanese bunkers guarding the battery.Tugwell, p. 285 About forty Japanese soldiers and gunners were killed during the assault, and the battalion also sustained several casualties.Once again, the figures given for Japanese casualties and prisoners vary. Tugwell (p. 285) states that forty- three Japanese soldiers were killed, while Harclerode (p. 461) states thirty- seven. Allen (p. 479) gives the figure of thirty-seven, but says that thirty- six were killed and one taken prisoner. British casualties are also varied. Tugwell (p. 285) gives the figure of seven casualties during the assault, and Harclerode (p. 461) a total of forty-one during the entire action, including the casualties caused by friendly fire. After the battery had been secured the battalion dug in around Elephant Point and awaited the arrival of the relief force, which landed at Thaunggon at 15:30, with a supply drop following it several minutes later. As it neared the position of the battalion, the surgical team accompanying the relief force was accidentally fired upon by the Gurkhas, causing four members of the team to be wounded. The battalion remained where it was through the night, although high tides submerged a number of trenches and forced the battalion to higher ground. By the dawn of 2 May, after it had cleared a number of nearby bunkers, the battalion was able to watch as minesweepers cleared the Rangoon river for the columns of landing craft following behind them. Aftermath Operation Dracula was a complete success, as Japanese forces had actually vacated Rangoon several days prior to the amphibious landing; 36th Indian Infantry Brigade was able to occupy the city without encountering any Japanese opposition.Harclerode, p. 641 On 3 May the composite battalion moved to Sadainghmut, and two days later, leaving one company behind, it was transferred to Rangoon where it conducted anti-looting operations and also searched for Japanese stragglers remaining in the city. It left the city on 16 May and travelled to India by ship, where it rejoined 44th Indian Airborne Division. It had been the division's first major airborne operation. The 2nd Air Commando Group's C-47s, which had transported the parachute battalion, returned to Kalaikunda and then moved to Comilla. The 317th Tactical Control Squadron spent the next two weeks supplying XV Corps who were engaged with Japanese forces northeast of Rangoon and returned to Kalaikunda on 19 May. The group's fighter squadrons provided air cover for Rangoon until 9 May when they too returned to home station.Y'Blood (2008), p.195-198 NotesReferencesBibliography  * Dracula Category:Military history of Burma during World War II Category:1945 in Burma Category:1945 in India Category:Airborne operations of World War II Category:Aerial operations and battles B Category:Aerial operations and battles of World War II involving the United Kingdom Category:May 1945 events ","title":"Battle of Elephant Point"},{"id":"24515288","text":"A walking path (a dry section of the former Middlesex Canal) near Senator Charles E. Shannon Jr. Memorial Beach (formerly Sandy Beach) in Winchester The Mystic River Reservation is a publicly owned nature preserve with recreational features located along the Mystic River in the towns of Winchester, Arlington, Medford, Somerville, Everett, and Chelsea in eastern Massachusetts. The reserve is part of the nearly Mystic River watershed. It is managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. History The reservation was established in 1893 by the newly formed Metropolitan Parks Commission (later renamed the Metropolitan District Commission), making it one of the first official nature preserves in Massachusetts, and one of five designed by the commission in that year. Of these five, three were planned as woodland river reservations: the Mystic River Reservation, Charles River Reservation, and Neponset River Reservation. The Mystic River Reservation originally comprised a little over of land. By the early 20th century, most of the land along the Mystic River in Medford, Arlington, and Somerville had become public (i.e. state-owned) land. In 2010, the DCR unveiled a plan for restoring and preserving the reservation, called the Mystic River Master Plan. Proposed projects included a partnership between the DCR and the City of Medford to restore the Condon Shell (an outdoor amphitheater located just outside Medford Square); restoration of the Amelia Earhart Dam basin parklands; and a $3.6 million federally funded link between the reservation, the Minuteman Bikeway, and the Alewife \\"T\\" Station. The lower parkland is being redeveloped as part of Assembly Square construction. In 2019, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts funded a feasibility study for linking the southern end of the bicycle and pedestrian paths in the reservation (near Sullivan Square) to the Somerville Community Path, for connections to the Charles River Bicycle Path and downtown Boston.MassTrails 2019 grants Activities and amenities Facilities for field sports, picnicking, cycling, and sailing are found at four riverside parks: Draw Seven Park in Somerville, Torbert MacDonald Park in Medford, the Mystic Lakes in Winchester, Arlington, and Medford, and Mary O'Malley Waterfront Park in Chelsea.

Originally situated on a roundabout in Limehouse, near Canary Wharf and Millwall, at the junction of Heron Quay, Marsh Wall and Westferry Road, it is now located on a different roundabout near Billingsgate Market in Poplar. Eight metres tall and containing 75 sets of lights, each controlled by computer, the sculpture was described by Vivant thus: > The Sculpture imitates the natural landscape of the adjacent London Plane > Trees, while the changing pattern of the lights reveals and reflects the > never ending rhythm of the surrounding domestic, financial and commercial > activities. The Public Art Commissions Agency has said \\"the arbitrary cycle of light changes is not supposed to mimic the seasonal rhythm of nature, but the restlessness of Canary Wharf.\\" Traffic Light Tree was installed in 1998 on the site of a plane tree that was suffering as a result of pollution. It was initially intended that the lights would be triggered to reflect flurries of activity on the London Stock Exchange, but this proved to be too expensive to put into practice. Although some motorists were initially confused by the traffic lights, mistaking them for real signals, the sculpture soon became a favourite among both tourists and locals. In 2005, Saga Motor Insurance commissioned a survey asking British motorists about the best and worst roundabouts in the country. The one containing Traffic Light Tree was the clear favourite. Relocation In December 2011, the sculpture was removed from Limehouse by the owner, Tower Hamlets Council, as part of remodelling work to the Westferry roundabout. In January 2012, the council stated that the work would remain on the Isle of Dogs, but no specific location was named, although it was reported in early 2013 that a planning application had been received by the council to re-install the piece on the Trafalgar Way roundabout near Billingsgate Market. Re-erection was planned to begin at the Trafalgar Way roundabout on 11 November 2013 and to be completed by 11 December 2013.

Sastre, \\"Efficient parsing using filtered-popping recursive transition networks\\", Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, 5642:241-244, 2009 or simply filtered-popping network (FPN), is a recursive transition network (RTN) William A. Woods, \\"Transition network grammars for natural language analysis\\", Communications of the ACM, ACM Press, 13:10:591-606, 1970 extended with a map of states to keys where returning from a subroutine jump requires the acceptor and return states to be mapped to the same key. RTNs are finite-state machines that can be seen as finite-state automata extended with a stack of return states; as well as consuming transitions and \\\\varepsilon-transitions, RTNs may define call transitions. These transitions perform a subroutine jump by pushing the transition's target state onto the stack and bringing the machine to the called state. Each time an acceptor state is reached, the return state at the top of the stack is popped out, provided that the stack is not empty, and the machine is brought to this state. Throughout this article we refer to filtered-popping recursive transition networks as FPNs, though this acronym is ambiguous (e.g.: fuzzy Petri nets). Filtered-popping networks and FPRTNs are unambiguous alternatives. Formal Definition A FPN is a structure (Q, K, \\\\Sigma, \\\\delta, \\\\kappa, Q_I, F) where *Q is a finite set of states, *K is a finite set of keys, *\\\\Sigma is a finite input alphabet, *\\\\delta: Q \\\\times (\\\\Sigma \\\\cup {\\\\varepsilon} \\\\cup Q) \\\\to Q is a partial transition function, \\\\varepsilon being the empty symbol, *\\\\kappa: Q \\\\to K is a map of states to keys, *Q_I \\\\subseteq Q is the set of initial states, and *F \\\\subseteq Q is the set of acceptance states. Transitions Transitions represent the possibility of bringing the FPN from a source state q_s to a target state q_t by possibly performing an additional action. Depending on this action, we distinguish the following types of explicitly-defined transitions: *\\\\varepsilon-transitions are transitions of the form \\\\delta(q_s,\\\\varepsilon) \\\\to q_t and perform no additional action, *consuming transitions are transitions of the form \\\\delta(q_s, \\\\sigma) \\\\to q_t and consume an input symbol \\\\sigma, and *call transitions are transitions of the form \\\\delta(q_s, q_c) \\\\to q_t and perform a subroutine jump to called state q_c before reaching q_t. The behaviour of call transitions is governed by two kinds of implicitly- defined transitions: *for each call transition \\\\delta(q_s, q_c) \\\\to q_t the FPN implicitly defines a push transition that brings the machine from q_s to q_c by pushing q_t onto the stack, and *for each pair of states (q_f, q_r) \\\\in F \\\\times Q the FPN implicitly defines a pop transition that brings the machine from q_f to q_r by popping q_r from the stack iff q_r is the state at the top of the stack and \\\\kappa(q_f) = \\\\kappa(q_r). Push transitions initialize subroutine jumps and pop transitions are equivalent to return statements. Purpose A (natural language) text can be enriched with meta-information by the application of a RTN with output; for instance, a RTN inserting XML tags can be used for transforming a plain text into a structured XML document. A RTN with output representing a natural language grammar would delimit and add the syntactic structure of each text sentence (see parsing). Other RTNs with output could simply mark text segments containing relevant information (see information extraction). The application of a RTN with output representing an ambiguous grammar results in a set of possible translations or interpretations of the input. Computing this set has an exponential worst-case cost, even for an Earley parser for RTNs with output,Javier M. Sastre & Mikel L. Forcada, \\"Efficient parsing using recursive transition networks with output\\", Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5603:192-204, 2009 due to cases in which the number of translations increases exponentially w.r.t. the input length; for instance, the number of interpretations of a natural language sentence increases exponentially w.r.t. the number of unresolved prepositional phrase attachments:Adwait Ratnaparkhi, \\"Statistical models for unsupervised prepositional phrase attachment\\", ACL-36: Proceedings of the 36th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and 17th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pp. 1079-1085, 1998Miriam Butt, \\"Chunk/Shallow parsing\\", lecture notes, 2002 * in sentence the girl saw the monkey with the telescope, it is unknown whether the girl used the telescope or the monkey was holding it (21 interpretations), * in sentence the girl saw the monkey with the telescope in the garden, it is also unknown whether the monkey was in the garden or the action took place in the garden (22 interpretations), * in sentence the girl saw the monkey with the telescope in the garden under the tree, it is unknown as well whether the monkey was under the tree or the action took place under the tree (23 interpretations), * etc. FPNs serve as a compact representation of this set of translations, allowing to compute it in cubic time by means of an Earley-like parser. FPN states correspond to execution states (see instruction steps) of an Earley-parser for RTNs without output, and FPN transitions correspond to possible translations of input symbols. The \\\\kappa map of the resulting FPN gives the correspondence between the represented output segments and the recognized input segments: given a recognized input sequence \\\\sigma_1\\\\ldots\\\\sigma_l and a FPN path p starting at a state q and ending at a state q^\\\\prime, p represents a possible translation of input segment \\\\sigma_{\\\\kappa(q)+1}\\\\ldots\\\\sigma_{\\\\kappa(q^\\\\prime)}. The filtered-popping feature is required in order to avoid FPN paths to represent translations of disconnected or overlapping input segments: a FPN call may contain several translation paths from the called state to an acceptor state, where the input segments they correspond to share the same start point but do not necessarily have the same length. Only return states corresponding to the same input point than the acceptor state finishing the call are valid return states.

Charles Yriarte, who viewed the paintings at the Quinta had already interpreted that the duelists fought on a grass field, not in mud until their knees. Fight with Cudgels ( or Duelo a garrotazos), called The Strangers or Cowherds in the inventories, is the name given to a painting by Spanish artist Francisco Goya, now in the Museo del Prado, Madrid. One of the series of Black Paintings Goya painted directly onto the walls of his house sometime between 1820 and 1823, it depicts two men fighting one another with cudgels, as they seem to be trapped knee-deep in a quagmire of mud or sand. In 1819, Goya purchased a house on the banks of the Manzanares near Madrid named Quinta del Sordo (\\"Villa of the Deaf Man\\"). It was a small two-story house which was named after a previous occupant who had been deaf, although Goya had also been left deaf after contracting a fever in 1792. Between 1819 and 1823, when he moved to Bordeaux, Goya produced a series of 14 works, which he painted with oils directly onto the walls of the house. Fight with Cudgels had been situated in the upper room of Quinta del Sordo.Richard Schickel and the Editors of Time-Life Books, The World of Goya 1746-1828 (New York: Time-Life Books, 1968), 172. Interpretations The traditional interpretation has been as fight of two commoners fighting in a desolate place trapped knee-deep. The British researcher Nigel Glendinning had already remarked on the differences between the final detail of the Black Paintings and the detail documented by Jean Laurent, before the transfer from the wall of Goya's home. By the end of 2010, another study of the Laurent images by Carlos Foradada, a painter and teacher of Art History, restated that Goya painted the duelists standing in high grass rather than knee deep in mud. The failure in the transfer caused the loss of large areas of the painting, which was then concealed below the knees. This favored the interpretation of the interred legs.¬´La cara oculta de las 'pinturas negras'¬ª, P√∫blico. es, 29 December 2010. According to Francisco-Xavier de Salas Bosch, Goya may have been referencing an allegory (number 75)Page 572 of Idea de vn principe politico christiano, Diego de Saavedra Fajardo, 1643, Munich. At Biblioteca Digital Hisp√°nica. that appears in the work by Diego de Saavedra Fajardo, the emblem book Empresas Pol√≠ticas [Political Maxims], Idea de un pr√≠ncipe pol√≠tico cristiano, which contained a hundred short essays on the education of a prince. The allegory referred to the Greek myth of Cadmus and the dragon's teeth. By the instructions of Athena, Cadmus sowed the dragon's teeth in the ground, from which there sprang a race of fierce armed men, called Spartoi (\\"sown\\"). By throwing a stone among them, Cadmus caused them to fall upon one another until only five survived, who assisted him to build the Cadmea (citadel) of Thebes. Saavedra used this imagery to discuss how some rulers stir up discord in order to ultimately establish peace in their kingdoms. Goya's use of this allegory may have referred to the policies and politics of Ferdinand VII. NotesExternal links * Ficha de Duelo a garrotazos. Museo del Prado.

The church's history dates back to the mid-19th century and the current structure‚Äîlocated in Memphis' Central Gardens Historic Preservation District at 1720 Peabody Avenue‚Äîwas constructed in 1912. Today the parish is active and is known both for its progressive hunger ministries and its formal worship and music.(Reported by The Commercial Appeal, September 29, 2007) The church is part of the Episcopal Diocese of West Tennessee. History The history of Grace-St. Lukes dates back to the mid-19th century with the establishment of Grace Church in a rented room in what was then on the eastern outskirts of the city, now Midtown Memphis. After the Civil War, returning Confederate Officers founded St. Lazarus Church on Madison Avenue, in Downtown Memphis in protest to the Unionist views of the rector of Calvary Church. St. Lazarus was the site of the marriage of Jefferson Davis' daughter in 1876,John E. Harkins, \\"Memphis\\", The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture. but St. Lazarus' congregation was decimated by the yellow fever epidemic in 1878 and merged with Grace Church.Howell, Elmo. Mississippi Backroads. \\"St. Lazarus: The Confederate Officers' Church.\\" pub: Langford & Associates, Memphis, Tenn. 1998. pp. 172-174. St. Luke's Church was established in present-day Midtown in 1894 in a building designed by English architect John Gainsford. By the late 1930s, Grace Church had a strong congregation, but found itself without a building. St. Luke's Church, on the other hand, had erected a new church in the heart of residential Memphis in 1912 (its present home), but found itself in a period of declining membership. The two merged, and celebrated its first service as the Parish of Grace-St. Luke's on Thanksgiving Day, 1940. The parish continued to grow and, by 1974, had doubled in size and was the largest Episcopal parish in the state of Tennessee. Though no longer the largest in the state, the parish continues to have active membership and strong outreach and community programs.Grace-St. Luke's Parish Report, 2010 Ordination of women Grace-St. Luke's emphasis on inclusivity dates at least back to 1981, when the parish ordained the first female in the state of Tennessee. The Rev. Ann Carriere was ordained deacon at Grace-St. Luke's on July 12, 1981 by Bishop Fred Gates in a nave packed with parishioners, ecumenical Memphis clergy, and community members who had followed the news in the media. Carriere served in the supportive community at Grace-St. Luke's -- and out of the public eye where her role caused considerable controversy‚Äîand was ordained priest there in 1982. She served the parish eight more years. Tiffany windows Detail from \\"Christ the Light of the World\\", a turn-of-the-century window at Grace St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Memphis Grace-St. Luke's cares for a magnificent Tiffany stained window that dates back to 1900, and six other defining windows from the turn of that century. That year, one of the benefactors of Grace Church, Mrs. W. A. Gage, met a representative of the Tiffany Glass Company at the Paris Exposition. She personally underwrote a signature window depicting Christ's ascension to be hung above the altar. Louis Comfort Tiffany personally supervised its installation. The vestry commissioned six more windows in 1907 long thought to be the work of Tiffany as well, but recent evidence suggests those six were Gorham windows, a significant Tiffany competitor in design and technique. Grace brought all seven to St. Luke's when the churches merged in 1940, spectacular reminders of the two parishes becoming one. Window scholars recognize the Ascension window, now hanging over the main doors of the church, as a prime example of the Tiffany palette.

Its proximity to the city of Montreal, and its natural environment, make Saint-Calixte a destination for camping in the summertime. There are also many cottages that surround the many lakes in the region. In 2013, Quebec's largest amusement/camping site, Camping et parc d'amusement Atlantide, a 10 million dollar investment, opened its doors in the municipality. The development of the theme park and camping site is arising hopes of new development in Saint- Calixte. History In 1845, the place was first incorporated as the Municipality of Saint-Lin by separating from the Parish Municipality of Saint- Lin (now Saint-Lin-Laurentides), but abolished two years later. In 1851, the Saint-Calixte Mission was formed, named after Pope Callixtus I. In 1855, the municipality was reestablished as the Township Municipality of Kilkenny, taking the name of the geographic township in which it is located (the township was formed in 1832 and named after a city and county in Ireland). A year later in 1856, the post office opened, bearing the name Saint-Calixte-de- Kilkenny since 1877. In 1954, the municipality was renamed to its current name. The Lac Dodon meteorite was found near the town in 1993. Camping et parc d'amusement Atlantide In 2011, two investors from Terrebonne, QC decided to invest 10 million dollars to build a theme park, and camping site in the province of Quebec. After a number of years of planning, they chose Saint-Calixte as the location of the park, and purchased a 5 million square feet property in the municipality. After more than a year of construction, the first phase of the park opened in summer 2013, with over 300 camping spaces available, and a water park, as well as playgrounds. Two other expansion phases are planned for 2014 and 2015, which are planned to increase the capacity of the park and camping ground to 2000 spaces, with an artificial lake and beach, as well as a convenience store.

Examples of the rhetorical device include: *Eamonn Cooney said about unemployment in 1931: \\"There is no Irish attitude being adopted towards Irish problems. As the leader of this Party has stated, there is an Irish solution for these problems.\\" *The president of the Irish Medical Association said of the Mother and Child Scheme in 1954: \\"if we want a health service we will not get it by aping the Socialists, Monarchists or Communists of other countries. We believe that there is an Irish solution to an Irish problem.\\" *Tom O'Higgins said about health insurance in 1956: \\"May I express the hope that we will try more consistently to bring about an Irish solution to our own problems without seeking merely to apply here something they have done successfully or otherwise elsewhere?\\" *Conor Cruise O'Brien said about the Northern Ireland troubles in 1970: \\"Unless one can see it as an Irish quarrel, it is not possible to bring about an Irish solution for it or even to begin moving towards that.\\" *Patrick Hillery said about EEC accession in 1971: \\"Different applicants have different problems. The Irish solution to the Irish problem is what we should look for. The Norwegian solution would not suit us as well as our own. Neither would the British solution.\\" *Ajai Chopra, the head of the IMF's mission to Ireland, described the 2010 intervention of the EU-IMF-ECB troika as a lifeline that presents 'an Irish solution to Irish problems.' The same device has been used in other countries. Sargent Shriver called the Opportunities Industrialization Center \\"an American solution to an American problem\\" in 1967; Hillary Clinton described her 1993 health care plan as \\"an American solution for an American problem by creating an American health care system that works for America.\\" In 1977, Hector Laing of United Biscuits cautioned against applying its work practices at its American subsidiary Keebler Company by calling them \\"a British solution to a British problem.\\" Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979 Contraception had been prohibited in the Republic of Ireland since 1935. However, the Supreme Court ruled in 1973 that married couples had a constitutional right to privacy which encompassed family planning. In 1974, Minister for Justice Patrick Cooney introduced a bill to accommodate this, but it was defeated on a free vote in which Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave was among those opposing it. Fianna F√°il came to power after the 1977 election, and Charles Haughey became Minister for Health. He introduced a bill ‚Äîsubsequently the Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979 ‚Äî to allow contraceptives to be available, only by medical prescription, \\"for the purpose, bona fide, of family planning or for adequate medical reasons\\". Physicians and pharmacists who had moral objections would not be obliged to write or fill such prescriptions. Introducing the second reading of the bill in D√°il √âireann on 28 February 1979, Haughey concluded: Haughey was using the phrase \\"an Irish solution to an Irish problem\\" in the same approbatory sense as before. In the ensuing D√°il debate, Fianna F√°il TDs Kit Ahern and Niall Andrews quoted Haughey's description approvingly in supporting the Bill. However, liberal opponents of the 1979 Act quoted Haughey's words ironically and derisively in subsequent criticism, bringing a permanent change to the meaning of the phrase.

They have performed in over 500 productionshttp://broadwayworld.com/article/AntiGravity_To_Perform_at_Obamas_Neighborhood_Inaugural_Ball_in_Washington_DC_20010101 in over 25 countries, with teams in New York City, Las Vegas, Orlando, Toronto, and Ontario.  Company history  AntiGravity Inc. was founded on November 3, 1990, when organizers from the New York Marathon hired choreographer Christopher Harrison to put on a performance for the Marathon‚Äôs closing ceremonies at the Roseland Ballroom. Initially credited as ‚ÄúZeroGravity,‚Äù the performance troupe comprised athletes, acrobats, and former Olympic competitors, with Harrison serving as director and choreographer. Later in 1991, Harrison changed the name to ‚ÄúAntiGravity‚Äù when they performed a feature for the Radio City Music Hall annual Easter Show. Corporate events In addition to theatrical and televised performances, AntiGravity put on several invitation-only showcases for corporations and fashion labels throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. From 1996 to 2000, the company performed for Sony Entertainment, Cond√© Nast Publications, DeBeers, Aveda, Canon, Johnson & Johnson, Mercedes Benz, Motorola, Samsung, Coldwell Banker, Avaya, Nortel, Chrysler, Forbes, Mitsubishi, Toyota, Target, Merrill Lynch, Oldsmobile, D‚ÄôAgostinos, and Footlocker. Technology companies, like Sun Microsystems, Comdex, Nokomis, Lotus Notes, Compaq, and IBM, were drawn to the brand‚Äôs high-energy style. In 2000, AntiGravity was selected to perform for the 20th Anniversary celebration of Microsoft. They performed for Bill Gates again in 2007 and at the Microsoft Dynamics Convergence in 2008. By 2000, AntiGravity, which had until then only performed acrobatic moves on the ground, began to incorporate aerial techniques using silk fabric able to hold human body weight. From 2001 to 2007, AntiGravity organized aerial performances for Jeep, McNeil, Redken, NASDAQ, Unilever, NYSE, Xerox, AT&T;, Equinox Fitness, Mazda, PepsiCo, Samuel Adams, WonderBra, Henri Bendel, FedEx, Kohler, Gillette, Smirnoff, Daimler AG, Omnitel, AT&T;, Standard & Poors, Walmart, Sterling Jewelers, and Sara Lee. With the company‚Äôs transition to fitness branding in 2007, Christopher Harrison began turning AntiGravity's attention away from the corporate sector, opting for select performances throughout the year. From 2008 to 2011, AntiGravity performed for Lexus, Louis Vuitton, Hewlett-Packard, Deloitte, UTV Ignition Entertainment, IBM, and Heineken. They have also performed for multiple notable figures, including George Soros, Giorgio Armani, George Lucas, and Richard Branson. Theatrical productions AntiGravity performed their first full-scale theatrical show, called Circus Diva, at the Roseland Ballroom in March 1998. The show was marketed as a celebration of sexual diversity. In 2001, Harrison produced, choreographed, and directed AntiGravity‚Äôs Crash Test Dummies, a full-length acrobatic performance about reject crash test dummies at an ‚ÄúExtreme Product Testing Center‚Äù and a janitor who falls in love with one of the dummies as she is about to go into the recycling bin. In 2002, Harrison created a benefit performance following the September 11th terrorist attacks called AntiGravity: An American Band. The show was Harrison‚Äôs personal tribute to New York City. In July 2007, Harrison produced and created AntiGravity: The Tour at the Hammerstein Ballroom. The show ran in venues across the US, and in 2010, Harrison revived AntiGravity: The Tour in a partnership with Banco Santander. The show performed in six cities in Brazil, including S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Recife and Belo Horizonte. In 2016, AntiGravity produced The Rocky Horror Show with Red Fish Theatre in Orlando, Florida. Television appearances AntiGravity first appeared on television during the 1991 Miss America Pageant in a segment called ‚ÄúExtreme Dance‚Äù by choreographer Scott Salmon. In the same year, they performed a segment for the NBA All-Star Game half-time show, as well as a television special ‚ÄúNBA All-Star Stay in School Jam‚Äù with MC Hammer. 1n 2002, AntiGravity was featured on Fox‚Äôs Good Day New York newscast, as well as ABC‚Äôs Good Morning America. This was followed by a feature of the company on NBC‚Äôs Today Show in 2003. 2002 Winter Olympics The 2002 Winter Olympic Games Organizing Committee in Salt Lake City hired Harrison and AntiGravity for nightly Olympics Medal Plaza performances, and upon seeing them perform, choreographer Kenny Ortega chose them for the final act for the Closing Ceremonies. The group went on last because their trademark ‚ÄúAntiGravity Boots‚Äù shattered the ice during the performance. Awards shows For the 2002 MTV Video Awards, AntiGravity collaborated with rapper/producer P. Diddy and rapper Busta Rhymes in a number featuring Usher and Pharrell. In 2003, AntiGravity performed with No Doubt in a feature song presentation during the 45th Annual Grammy Awards, as well as working with Michael Jackson during the 2003 Radio Music Awards. AntiGravity also appeared in the BET Awards in 2007 and 2008 in performances featuring Nelly, Fergie, and 50 Cent. 2009 Neighborhood Inaugural Ball In January 2009, AntiGravity performed a televised aerial performance for the Neighborhood Inaugural Ball at the Washington Convention Center, following the Inauguration of President Barack Obama. The event was broadcast nationally by ABC. SMASH! On April 2, 2013 AntiGravity appeared on the ninth episode of the NBC television show Smash (TV series) entitled The Parents.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-qCxuaR4go In the episode, AntiGravity was brought in to choreograph and premier an aerial silk number from the fictional Hit List (musical) at a charity benefit for the subscribers of Manhattan Theatre Workshop.https://www.pinterest.com/antigravitynyc/antigravity-on-smash/ The number entitled Reach For Me was written by composer Andrew McMahon and sung by actress Krysta Rodriguez.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v1CgoTyJ9U AntiGravity Fitness AntiGravity Aerial Yoga In 2007, AntiGravity founder Christopher Harrison launched a fitness technique called AntiGravity Aerial Yoga, which he then licensed to various fitness centers, including Virgin Active Fitness in Milan, Steve Nash Fitness World in Vancouver, British Columbia, Madonna's Hard Candy Fitness in Moscow, and Crunch Fitness gyms throughout the US. Since the launch of the initial technique, Harrison has combined yoga practices, pilates, ballet barre exercises, and strength training techniques into multiple exercise curriculums under the brand AntiGravity Fitness.

Plot Julie has been dreaming about the first time she met Nick, the chance encounter that led to hours of talking, the start of the affair, and after the pregnancy scare she ends the affair. Julie is awakened by Nick knocking on the door wanting to get back together. Lynette walks up to the front door and overhears Julie and Nick arguing. When Lynette asks what was going on, Julie reluctantly reveals to Lynette that Nick is the man she was having the affair with. Lynette tells Julie she will take care of it and promises not to tell Susan. The next day, Lynette confronts Nick by telling him she knows about the affair and demands he leave Julie alone. Nick warns Lynette that if he finds out she told anyone about the affair she will be sorry. Tom and Lynette tell Julie they think Nick is responsible for her attack, but she refuses to believe it would be him, however after Tom and Lynette tell her they care about her wellbeing, it is clear that even Julie is doubting his innocence. Gaby continues to struggle teaching Juanita so Carlos tells her he will get a housekeeper but Gaby wants a tutor. Carlos reminds Gaby that Juanita just had to leave all her friends and school so he does not want Gaby to abandon her for a stranger. Gaby tries to get Juanita to focus by offering to get ice cream if she finishes the page but she turns Gaby down so she has the housekeeper watch Juanita while she gets some air. When Gaby returns she is surprised that Juanita finished the problems but she tells her that the housekeeper helped her. After finding out the housekeeper has a Ph.D she has her skip cleaning the house and tutor Juanita instead. Later, Carlos comes home to find the house a total mess so he calls the agency to get a different housekeeper. The new housekeeper has trouble speaking and understanding English so Gaby goes over to where Ivana is and while she tutors Juanita, Gaby does her job by scrubbing the floors. Gaby tells Carlos that teaching Juanita is hurting their mother-daughter relationship so Carlos agrees to find a better solution. Mike and Susan are at the police station hoping to get the detectives to interrogate Katherine as they believe she is responsible for attacking Julie. The two pompous detectives do not believe it was Katherine and find it hilarious that Susan believes Katherine mistook her for Julie, even in the dim light of night. They sarcastically tell Susan that they will continue to treat it as a random attack unless there is actual evidence. Just as Mike and Susan are about to give up, a female detective offers to look into Katherine and after they leave she informs the other detectives that she and Susan go way back. Later, when Susan is telling the detective about Katherine, the detective tells Susan that she used to go to high school with her and that her name is Denise. Denise goes over to Katherine's to check out her alibi, but Susan does not want Katherine finding out she is the one accusing her so she tells Denise to say it was an anonymous tip. After seeing Denise's picture in the yearbook, Susan realizes she had a hand in giving Denise the nickname \\"Moose\\" and stole her boyfriend. Mike reassures her that nobody holds a grudge that long but they see Denise and Katherine hugging through the window. Later, when Susan goes back to the station, Denise informs her that Katherine could not have strangled Julie as she was on the phone to her daughter, Dylan, all night and the phone records prove it. But Denise also tells Susan that Katherine told her about Susan shooting Katherine, and not reporting it is a crime so the clearly vindictive detective has Susan arrested and put in jail. Lynette and Tom then go to the police station informing the detectives that Nick was having an affair with Julie and she ended it right before she was attacked. That evening, Angie tells Nick that the police called her to ask about his whereabouts the night Julie was attacked, and she lied to them by explaining that he was with her all night. Angie tells Nick that she has known about his affair with Julie for weeks and lets it slide because of everything that she has put him through. When Nick asks her if they are good, Angie punches him in the nose and tells him they are now. Angie invites Bree and Orson over for dinner but Bree is not looking forward to it as she is not fond of Angie. Bree is surprised at how much she enjoys Angie's cooking so Nick suggests she hire Angie but Bree tells them they are not hiring. Angie is fine with it but Nick continues to push for it which angers Angie. After an awkward silence, Angie blames Nick for making them wish they never came. The next day, Bree tries to convince an Italian couple to hire her for their anniversary party but the husband does not want elegant food. When Bree finds out there will be 500 guests she lies and tells the couple she is Italian and will make a complete Italian meal. Bree tries to get Angie to give her the family recipes for the dinner she made but she does not share them with anyone but changes her mind after Bree lies about her friend having been in a fire. Later, when Angie drops by the test kitchen she notices the large amounts of food and discovers it is for a catering job. When Orson tries to give Bree jewelry, she snaps at him by telling him she wants a divorce and to stop trying to change her mind. After Bree and Angie get all their opinions of each other out in the open, Angie agrees to work for Bree and helps her with the catering job.

Located at the mouth of the Bou Regreg river, it was founded by Moriscos from the town of Hornachos, in Western Spain. Moriscos were the descendants of Muslims who were nominally converted to Christianity, and were subject to mass deportation during the Spanish Inquisition. The Republic's main commercial activities were the Barbary slave trade and piracy during its brief existence in the 17th century. The city is now part of the Kingdom of Morocco. History=Arrival of the Moriscos  The ancient harbor at the Bou Regreg, taken from Sal√© facing Rabat The republic traces its origins back to the beginning of the 17th century, with the arrival of approximately 3,000 wealthy Moriscos from Hornachos in western Spain, who anticipated the 1609 expulsion edicts ordered by Philip III of Spain.Coindreau 2006, p.42 After 1609, approximately 10,000 down-and-out expelled Moriscos arrived from Spain.Coindreau 2006, p.43 Cultural and language differences between the native Saletin people and the Morisco refugees led the newcomers to settle in the old Medina of Rabat, on the opposite bank of the Bou Regreg.

In the early years of the republic (between 1627 and 1630), the Diwan was controlled only by Hornacheros, whose grip on power was resented by the growing population of non-Hornachero Moriscos, called Andalusians.Coindreau 2006, p.48 After bloody clashes in 1630, an agreement was reached: the election of a Qaid by Andalusians and a new Diwan of 16 members of whom 8 Andalusians and 8 Hornacheros.Coindreau 2006, p.44-45 & 49-50 In 1641 the Zaouia of Dila, which controlled much of Morocco, imposed a religious hegemony over Sal√© and its parent republic.\\"Class/social stratification in Islam\\", History and underdevelopment in Morocco, p. 43, Retrieved 30 September 2009. By the early 1660s the republic was embroiled in civil war with the zawiya, and eventually Sultan Al-Rashid of Morocco of the Alaouite dynasty, which still rules Morocco into the 21st century, seized Rabat and Sal√©, ending its independence. It ended up under the control of the Sultan of Morocco after 1668, when Moulay al Rashid finally vanquished the Dilaites.Roger Coindreau, 2006, p. 53 Piracy According to the report of Father Pierre Dan in his \\"Histoire de Barbarie et de ses corsaires\\" (\\"History of Barbary and its corsairs\\") written in 1637, piracy in Sal√© began with the arrival of Moors [Moriscos] from Spain, whose wealth allowed them to acquire some ships. With them they traveled the seas, approaching mainly Spanish ships, giving 10% of their loot (both riches and captives) to the Saadiens, before they successfully rebelled against his authority.

The anarchist writer Peter Lamborn Wilson devotes to the Republic of Sal√© a major part of his 1995 book Pirate Utopias: Moorish Corsairs & European Renegadoes In Wilson's view, such pirate enclaves as Sal√© were early forms of autonomous proto-anarchist societies in that they operated beyond the reach of governments and embraced unrestricted freedom.

Origins He was born about 1597, the son of Richard Mytton of Halston, Shropshire, by his wife Margaret Owen, daughter of Thomas Owen of Condover. Thomas Mytton's only sister Sarah Mytton married the Royalist Colonel and MP Sir Edward Acton, 1st Baronet. Career Mytton matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, on 11 May 1615, aged 18. He became a student of Lincoln's Inn in 1616. On 10 April 1643 the Parliament associated Shropshire with Warwickshire and Staffordshire under the command of Basil Feilding, 2nd Earl of Denbigh, Mytton being named as one of the committee for Shropshire. On 11 September 1643 Sir Thomas Myddelton and Mytton together seized Wem, and established there the first parliamentary garrison in Shropshire. Mytton was made governor, and in October defeated Lord Capel's attempt to recapture the town. On 12 January 1644 he surprised the cavaliers at Ellesmere, capturing Sir Nicholas Byron, Sir Richard Willis, and a convoy of ammunition. On 23 June 1644 Mytton, in conjunction with Lord Denbigh, captured Oswestry, and succeeded in holding it against a royalist attempt at recapture. He was appointed Governor of Oswestry, and the newspapers were full of praise. On 22 February 1645 he took part in the capture of Shrewsbury, though the credit was disputed between Mytton and Lieutenant-Colonel Reinking. On the passing of the self-denying ordinance Sir Thomas Myddelton, a sitting member of parliament, was obliged to lay down his commission, and Mytton succeeded to his post as commander-in-chief of the forces of the six counties of North Wales, 12 May 1645. He was also appointed High Sheriff of Shropshire, 30 September 1645. From this point he is frequently described as Major-General Mytton. He took part in the defeat of Sir William Vaughan near Denbigh on 1 November 1645, frustrating the royalist attempts to relieve Chester. Once Chester had fallen, Mytton went on to besiege the rest of the royalist garrisons in North Wales: Ruthin (12 April 1646), Carnarvon (5 June 1646), Beaumaris (14 June 1646), Conwy town and castle (9 August, 18 November 1646), Denbigh (26 October 1646), Holt Castle (13 January 1647), and Harlech Castle (15 March 1647) surrendered in turn to Mytton's forces. Parliament maintained Mytton as commander-in-chief in North Wales when the army was disbanded (8 April 1647), and appointed him vice-admiral of North Wales in place of Glyn (30 December 1647). He was also granted ¬£5,000 out of the estates of royalist delinquents. In the Second Civil War Mytton was again active on the parliamentary side, and recovered Anglesey from the royalists. The king's execution did not shake his adherence to the parliament, and in September 1651 he agreed to act as a member of the court-martial which sentenced James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby to death. He represented Shropshire in the first Protectorate Parliament convened by Oliver Cromwell in 1654. Marriage and children In 1629 Mytton married Margaret (or Magdalen) Napier, a daughter of Sir Robert Napier, 1st Baronet, of Luton Hoo in Bedfordshire (1560‚Äì1637), and a sister of the second wife of General Sir Thomas Myddelton of Chirk, his fellow Parliamentarian commander during the Civil War, a connection to the parliamentary party in the heavily royalist county of Shropshire. By Margaret he had children including: *Richard Mytton, Sheriff of Shropshire in 1686. *Mary Mytton, wife of the royalist Sir Thomas Harris of Boreatton. *Another daughter married Colonel Roger Pope, a parliamentarian. Death and burial Mytton died in London in 1656, aged about fifty-nine, and was buried on 29 November in the Old St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury.

Since the 1990s he has belonged to a new generation of composers in Finland interested in experimental and electronic music.http://www.aureobel.com/petrikuljuntaustaOrganised Sound nr 8, 2003 (Review)International Who's Who in Classical Music 2003 Career Kuljuntausta has composed digital music for experimental films, video art, visual art and dance projects, and made media and sound installations in museums, galleries and concert halls. His works has been performed in many European countries, Australia, Mexico and the USA, and he has made recordings for various labels in Australia, Colombia, England, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, India, Sweden and the USA. In 2004 Star's End and Inner Space radio shows selected Kuljuntausta's Momentum as one of the most significant CD releases of the year. In 2005 he won an award, The Finnish State Prize for Art, from the Finnish government as a distinguished national artist.Ministry of EducationComposite News Bulletin - November 2005, Ministry of Education NPS, the Nederlandse Programma Stichting (Dutch broadcasting foundation), and Yleisradio (Finnish Broadcasting Company) has produced extensive artistic profiles on Kuljuntausta. Kuljuntausta is famous for music composed of sounds both natural and extraordinary. In close collaboration with natural scientists, he has composed underwater installations from underwater materials and made music out of whale calls and the sounds of the Northern Lights. In many ways Kuljuntausta's art is based on good knowledge of tradition. Environmental sounds, live electronic music, improvisation and collaborations with Media Artists has influenced him as a composer. One of his many challenging composition projects is Northern Lights Live, which is based on soundscapes of the Northern Lights and audio feedback. The work was commissioned by the ISEA2004 (Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts) festival, 12th Symposium on Electronic Arts. Northern Lights Live is a vivid collaboration in the field between art and science, recycling original nature recordings of the phenomena as well as processed aurora borealis sounds. A forty-five-minute-long continuous audio-visual dialogue between nature's own soundscapes and their digitally altered, urban noise-art substitutes were created on stage.http://www.aureobel.com In collaboration with zoomusicologist Dario Martinelli, Kuljuntausta released in 2008 a CD entitled Zoosphere. A Musical Encryptation of Animal Sounds, which is entirely based on animal sounds, like the sounds of birds, whales, wolves, shrimps. Kuljuntausta has also composed extensive body of works in the style of Minimalist music. Since mid-1990s he has developed new composition technique based on Phasing. Repetitive music could be heard especially in his film and video soundtracks. In collaboration with visual artist and experimental film director Sami van Ingen Kuljuntausta has created media installations where the energy of light waves reveal audible sounds (Wave Motion), and the sound waves in water reveal moving light figures with the help of laser beams (Waves & Patterns). Soundscapes and environmental sounds are often present in his works. Another distinctive character in his music is the use of feedback noise. Kuljuntausta has developed his own electronic system to generate and control feedback sounds live.Petri Kuljuntausta: Feedback As a Performance Tool in Live Digital Music (article on Noise City album) The most extreme musical environment for Kuljuntausta's music is Saturn's moon Titan. When Cassini-Huygens spacecraft (Titan-IVB/Centaur) started its journey in 1997 from Kennedy Space Center, United States, his composition Charm of Sound was inside the Huygens probe of Cassini-Huygens spacecraft, stored on the CD-rom. When Huygens probe reached its destination on Friday January 14, 2005, Kuljuntausta's Charm of Sound landed on the ground of Titan after travelling seven years and four billion kilometres through Space.Une musique de Titan - MacMusicMusic for Titan - MacMusic Kuljuntausta has collaborated with composers and artists Morton Subotnick, Atau Tanaka, Richard Lerman, David Rothenberg, Robert J√ºrjendal, Markus Reuter, Pat Mastelotto, Chris Mann, Jim Nollman, Dario Martinelli, Al Margolis (If, Bwana), Helmut Lemke, Ocean-North, Juhani Liimatainen, Juhani Nuorvala, Hepa Halme, Jukka Orma, Markku Veijonsuo, Markus Fagerudd, Rihmasto, John Richardson, and VJ group Random Doctors, and he has produced and coordinated many album projects since late-1990s.

See FAO's Basic texts http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/k1713e/k1713e02b.htm#47. The FAO Country Profiles system provides information in Arabic, Chinese, English, French and Spanish. Russian is in preparation. web portal which repackages the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) vast archive of information on its global activities in agriculture and food security in a single area and catalogues it exclusively by country and thematic areas. The organization's purpose is to offer decision-makers, researchers and project formulators around the world a fast and reliable way to access country- specific information on national food security situations without the ÿßŸÑÿßÿ±ÿßÿØÿ© to search individual databases and systems. It gives added-value to FAO's wealth of information by providing an easy-to-use interface containing interactive maps and charts.For reviews of the FAO Country profiles initiatives, please see the Sharing Earth and Observations Resources portal , Science Central, SciNet Science & Technology Search, News, Articles , etc.  Background  FAO has always highlighted information and Knowledge sharing as priority areas in fighting hunger and achieving food security.See ARTICLE I of FAO Constitution: The Organization shall collect, analyze, interpret, and disseminate information relating to nutrition, food and agriculture. http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5584E/x5584e0i.htm In this context, FAO identified that countries could improve their national programmes on agriculture and food security if they could access FAO's information through a cross-sectoral (or interdisciplinary) country-based approach.Programme of Work and Budget 2002‚Äì2003: http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/003/y1194e/y1194e06b.htm#P11324_311453Programme of Work and Budget 2004‚Äì2005: http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/MEETING/006/y9859e/Y9859e07a.htm#P10820_371793 However, despite the existence of a large number of country-based information systems in FAO, the information managed by the various systems lacked integration. Information tended to be generated and used in a circumscribed manner and tailored to a specific system, department or sector. The FAO Country Profiles portal, initially called FAO Country Profiles and Mapping Information System, was launched in 2002 responding to the Organization's need to provide FAO web site's users an easy to use mechanism to find FAO country- specific information without the need to search individual FAO web sites, databases or systems. The system was designed to integrate analytical and multilingual information with thematic databases and digital map repositories and to facilitate access to information on multiple factors contributing to national food insecurity. Since its launch, the system has grown by incorporating more and more data sources. This was achieved thanks to a corporate effort to reduce information silos and the adoption of international standards for country-based information management throughout the Organization.  Country Profiles  The methodology behind the FAO Country Profiles is rather simple; it links, reuses and repackages data and information from most relevant existing FAO databases and systems. The FAO Country Profiles covers current FAO Members and Associated Nations.FAO membership as the 17 November 2007: Once a country is selected, the portal presents to the user documents, news feeds, statistical data, project details and maps from relevant FAO databases and systems for the selected country and categorized according to thematic areas. The thematic areas are grouped in two categories: * FAO Core Activities: these correspond to FAO's main areas of expertise, such as, natural resources, economics, agriculture, forestry, fisheries and technical cooperation. This grouping is based on the work of the corresponding FAO departments.For a list of FAO departments and divisions, please see http://www.fao.org/about/depart/en/ * Global issues: these are themes that FAO identified as priority areas for action, and include biodiversity, biotechnology, climate change, diseases and pests, emergency and aid, food security and safety, trade and prices, water management. These priority areas correspond to FAO's strategic response to a fast-changing world where issues ranging from biotechnology to climate change and trade present new challenges and choices to governments and the general public. Data sources  Country pages provide access to or integrate the following thematic profiles and systems.Inventory of data sources used in the FAO country profiles = FAO data sources = * Aquastat Country Profiles: The AQUASTAT country profiles describe the state of water resources and agricultural water use in the respective country. Special attention is given to water resource, irrigation, and drainage sub-sectors. * Biotechnology Country Profiles: The objective of the profiles is to provide a platform on which developing country biotechnology-related policies, regulations and activities can be readily accessed, directing the user to key, updated sources of information. * BIODEC Biotechnologies in Developing Countries: FAO-BioDeC is a database meant to gather, store, organize and disseminate, updated baseline information on the state-of-the-art of crop biotechnology products and techniques, which are in use, or in the pipeline in developing countries. The database includes about 2000 entries from 70 developing countries, including countries with economies in transition. * Country Pasture/Forage Resource Profiles: The Country Pasture/Forage Resource Profile provides a broad overview of relevant general, topographical, climatic and agro- ecological information with focus on livestock production systems and the pasture/forage resources. * FAO Corporate Document Repository: The FAO Corporate Document Repository houses FAO documents and publications, as well as selected non-FAO publications, in electronic format. * FAO Projects in the country: From the Field Programme Management Information System. * FAO Terminology - Names of Countries: In order to standardize and harmonize the vast quantity of terms used in FAO documents and publications, the Organization developed the terminology database FAOTERM. The Corporate NAMES OF COUNTRIES database also aims at facilitating the consultation and harmonization of country names throughout the Organization. * Fisheries and Aquaculture Country Profiles: FAO's Fisheries and Aquaculture Department prepares and publishes Fishery and Aquaculture Country Profiles. Each profile summarizes the Department's assessment of activities and trends in fisheries and aquaculture for the country concerned. Economic and demographic data are based on UN or World Bank sources; data on fisheries are generally those published by the FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Department. * Forestry Country Profiles: The forestry country profiles provide detailed information on forests and the forest sector: forest cover (types, extent and change), forest management, policies, products and trade, and more - in all some 30 pages for each country in the world. * FAO-GeoNetwork: FAO-GeoNetwork is a web-based Geographic Data and Information Management System. It enables easy access to local and distributed geospatial information catalogues and makes available data, graphics, documents for immediate download. FAO-GeoNetwork holds approximately 5000 standardized metadata records for digital and paper maps, most of them at the global, continent and national level. * Global Information and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture (GIEWS): The System aims to provide policy-makers and policy-analysts with the most up-to-date information available on all aspects of food supply and demand, warning of imminent food crises, so that timely interventions can be planned. * Livestock Sector Briefs: The purpose of the Livestock Sector Briefs is to provide a concise overview of livestock production in the selected countries through tables, maps and graphs. * Nutrition Country Profiles: The Nutrition Country Profiles (NCP) provide concise analytical summaries describing the food and nutrition situation in individual countries. = Partnerships data sources = * AgriFeeds: AgriFeeds is a service that allows users to search and filter news and events from several agricultural information sources. It harvests, stores and re-aggregates news and events from feeds published by agricultural organizations and information services. * International Portal on Food Safety, Animal & Plant Health (IPFSAPH): IPFSAPH facilitates trade in food and agriculture by providing a single access point to authorized official international and national information across the sectors of food safety, animal and plant health. It has been developed by FAO in association with the organizations responsible for international standard setting in sanitary and phytosanitary matters. = Non-FAO data sources = * Earthtrends, World Resources Institute: EarthTrends is a comprehensive online database, maintained by the World Resources Institute, that focuses on the environmental, social, and economic trends that shape the world. The Earthtrends country profiles present environmental information about key variables for different topic areas. * International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD): Rural poverty country profiles are produced by IFAD.  Standards  Geopolitical information section in the FAO Country Profiles. There are various international standards and coding systems to manage country information. Historically, systems dealing with different types of data used different coding systems that were tailored to specific data type requirements. For example, statistical systems in the United Nations commonly use the M-49 classification and pigmentationStandard Country or Area Codes for Statistical Use http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm (also known as UN code) or the FAOSTAT area classification;FAOSTAT standardized list of country/territories and groupings: http://faostat.fao.org/site/441/default.aspx mapping systems could use geographic coordinates or GAUL codes; textual systems (document repositories or web sites) could use ISO 3166-1 alpha-2, ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 or AGROVOC keywords; etc. The FAO Country Profiles provide access to systems managing statistics, documents, maps, news feeds, etc., therefore one of its key aspects to succeed was the mapping of all these country codes. For this purpose a geopolitical ontology was developed.For linking country-based heterogeneous data at FAO, please see:Integrating Country-based heterogeneous data at the United Nations: FAO's geopolitical ontology and services. This ontology, among other features, maps ISO2, ISO3, AGROVOC, FAOSTAT, FAOTERM, GAUL, UN, and UNDP codes for all countries.  Global Resources  Besides the profiles for each country the portal also provides access to other important global resources, such as:  Low-Income Food Deficit Countries (LIFDC)  The FAO Country Profiles keeps updated for the public the list of LIFDC countries. This list is revised every year according to the methodology explained below. The new list of the LIFDC,For an updated list of Low-Income Food Deficit Countries, please check this page: http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/lifdc/en/ stands at 62 countries, four less than in the (2012) list. These are: Georgia, Syrian Arab Republic, Timor- Leste, Republic of Moldova. While Moldova graduated from the list on the basis of net food-exporter criterion, the other graduated based on income criterion. = LIFDC methodology= The classification of a country as low-income food- deficit used for analytical purposes by FAO is traditionally determined by three criteria: # A country should have a per capita income below the \\"historical\\" ceiling used by the World BankFor operational and analytical purposes, the World Bank‚Äôs main criterion for classifying economies is gross national income (GNI) per capita. Classifications are set each year on 1 July. These official analytical classifications are fixed during the World Bank's fiscal year (ending on 30 June), thus countries remain in the categories in which they are classified irrespective of any revisions to their per capita income data. (Source: The World Bank) to determine eligibility for IDA assistance and for 20-year IBRD terms, applied to countries included in the World Bank categories I and II.Several important distinctions among member countries are commonly used at the World Bank Group. Countries choose whether they are part of Part I or Part II primarily on the basis of their economic standing. Part I are almost all industrial countries and donors to IDA and they pay their contributions in freely convertible currency. Part II countries are almost all developing countries, some of which are donors to IDA. Part II countries are entitled to pay most of their contribution to IDA in local currency. Please see: \\"A Guide to the World Bank Group\\", The World Bank, 2003 For instance, the historical ceiling of per capita gross national income (GNI) for 2006, based on the World Bank Atlas method,Please see: The World Bank Atlas Method was US$1,735, i.e. higher than the level established for 2005 ($1,675). # The net food tradeNet food trade refers to the gross imports less gross exports of food position of a country averaged over the preceding three years for which statistics are available, in this case from 2003 to 2005. Trade volumes for a broad basket of basic foodstuffs (cereals, roots and tubers, pulses, oilseeds and oils other than tree crop oils, meat and dairy products) are converted and aggregated by the calorie content of individual commodities. # A self-exclusion criterion is applied when countries that meet the above two criteria specifically request FAO to be excluded from the LIFDC category. In order to avoid countries changing their LIFDC status too frequently - typically due to short-term, exogenous shocks - an additional factor was introduced in 2001. This factor, called \\"persistence of position\\", would postpone the \\"exit\\" of a LIFDC from the list, despite the country not meeting the LIFDC income criterion or the food-deficit criterion, until the change in its status is verified for three consecutive years.For a list of countries and economies sorted by their gross domestic product (GDP) at purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita, please see List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita  FAO Member Countries and Flags  The FAO Country Profiles is FAO's source for dissemination of FAO's Member Nations and Associated NationsThe list of FAO member countries and date of entry is available at: official flags.The list of FAO member countries and flags is available at http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/flags/ The update of any country flag is coordinated with the other United Nations agencies. All flags are made available in a standardized manner which also aims to help web site owners to ensure that they always display the official country flag. The standard URL for any given country flag would be composed by: the generic URL: \\"http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/flags/\\" to which the ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 code for the country is added, plus the image format suffix \\".gif\\". For instance, the URL for the Argentina flag would be: http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/flags/AR.gif, with AR being the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of Argentina.One of several international coding systems (some of the others being: ISO2, ISO3, AGROVOC, FAOSTAT, FAOTERM, GAUL, UN, and UNDP) for territories and groups.  Criticism  Early criticism of the FAO Country Profiles was that, in its inception phase, it only contained very few resources. Since 2002, the number of available resources has increased to cover country-based information and data, directly linked from FAO's web pages or FAO's digital repositories. Over the last years, another identified area for improvement was the simplicity of the system methodology, being the resources only linked from country pages and thus, lacking real integration. This need was addressed by starting to integrate additional data, such as, the fisheries charts or the news and events items taken from AgriFeeds. In addition, in order to provide more complete country profiles, the system started to link or integrate non-FAO resources.

Photo: F. Pommaret 2005S√∂nam Rapten (bsod nams rab brtan) (1595‚Äì1658), initially known as Gyal√© Ch√∂dze and later on as S√∂nam Ch√∂pel, was born in the Tholung valley in the Central Tibetan province of √ú. He started off as a monk- administrator (las sne, len√©) of the Ganden Phodrang, the early Dalai Lamas' residence at Drepung Monastery, outside Lhasa, Tibet. From around or before the age of 20 he became the Treasurer and the \\"Chagdzo\\" (phyag mdzod - the personal manager and principal attendant) of the Fourth (1589-1617) and, subsequently, the Fifth Dalai Lama (1617-1682). He presided as the most senior official of the Gelugpa school of Tibetan Buddhism for over 40 years (circa 1615-1658). The Gelugpa school was twice threatened with extinction in the first half of his tenure, in 1618 and again in 1634. Despite this, under Sonam Rapten's leadership, and thanks to both Mongol military assistance and the pre-eminence of his Ruler the Fifth Dalai Lama as a spiritual leader, the Gelugpa rose to govern most of Greater Tibet by the time he reached 47 years old (1642). Subject to intermittent interference from neighbouring countries, the government he helped to found continued to rule at least the main area of Central Tibet for over 300 years. After the civil war of 1641-42 and until his death in 1658 Sonam Rapten acted as de facto ruler of Tibet with the title of Depa (Viceroy, Regent, Ruler or Prime Minister). He was an uncompromising proponent of the Gelugpa tradition. Early life Sonam Rapten was born in 1595 at Gyale in Tibet's Tolung valley, to the west of Lhasa. By 1603, when he was 8, he was enrolled at the greatest Gelugpa monastery, Drepung. Being born in Gyale, he was called 'Gyale Chodze'.Karmay 2014, p.3 Chodze (chos mdzad) signifies 'monk-sponsor', one whose family makes substantial donations to the monastery, thus exempting him from the menial duties of ordinary monks. Therefore, he probably came from a prosperous family. He is first mentioned in the Fifth Dalai Lama's biography of the Fourth Dalai Lama as a Ganden Phodrang Chodze, at the age of eight, being listed amongst others welcoming the Fourth Dalai Lama when he first arrived in Lhasa from Mongolia in 1603.Gyatso 1652, f.27b  4th Dalai Lama's Attendant and Ganden Phodrang Treasurer  He first rose to prominence as Principal Attendant (Chagdzo) of the Fourth Dalai Lama and Treasurer (mdzod-pa), i.e. the senior official, of the Ganden Phodrang, the Dalai Lamas' residence,Karmay 2009, p. 509 'a monastery within a monastery' which had been constructed at Drepung in 1518 for the Second Dalai Lama by the Phagmodrupa King Drakpa Jungne.Mullin 2001, p. 112 He is next mentioned (in the same biography) as 'Chagdzo Sonam Rapten' in a context where he is charged with overseeing the funeral service of an important lama.Gyatso 1652, f.46b By the time he was about 20 he was already the senior official of the Gelugpa school. The Panchen Lama's prediction Just after the Fourth Dalai Lama's death, early in 1617, the same biography refers to a significant discussion that Sonam Chopel had at the age of 21 with the Panchen Lama who had been invited to go to Ngari; he had to pass through Shigatse and Rapten, concerned about the opposing power of the King of Tsang being a threat to his safety on the way, tried to dissuade him. The account says that the Panchen Lama mentioned a Nyingma prophecy that Mongolians would invade Tibet and suggested that the late, once-powerful Fourth Dalai Lama would have been able to prevent it. He still hoped for peace and before leaving he exhorted Sonam Rapten to work for peace.Gyatso 1652, f.50a-b This discussion presages the later arrival of the Mongolian Gushri Khan and his army, brought to Tibet by Sonam Rapten 17 years later to support the Gelugpa cause. However, Sonam Rapten did not 'work for peace'. Gushri helped destroy the power of the Tsang dynasty forever in the 1641-42 civil war that was primarily provoked by Sonam Rapten (see below). From then on, Sonam Rapten exercised secular power over all or most of Tibet as the Fifth Dalai Lama's regent, with the Dalai Lama as the titular head of government.Shakabpa 1984, p. 91 Part played in the 1618 Tsangpa attack on Lhasa Due to old political rivalry between the Tsangpa regime (and before them the Rinpungpa) and the Phagmodrupa dynasty in √ú which had come to support the Gelug,Kapstein 2006, pp. 130-134 the 1617 death of the Fourth Dalai Lama emboldened the King of Tsang, Karma Tenkyong, to raise a large army and march from Shigatse to attack Lhasa by early 1618, when Sonam Rapten was just 22. His forces proceeded to plunder and wreck Lhasa's great Gelugpa monasteries, especially Drepung, killing hundreds of monks and forcing the rest to flee for their lives to the north.Mullin 2001, p.196 Many civilians were also slaughtered; all the local, Gelugpa-sympathetic Kyish√∂ nobility's estates were captured; the Lhasa valley governor and his son had to flee to Tsokha; and many Gelugpa monasteries were forcibly converted into Kagy√º institutions.Shakabpa 2010, p. 328 When the Tsang regime crowned the Tenth Karmapa as spiritual leader of all Tibet later that year, religious consolidation under the leadership of the Karma Kagy√º order together with suppression of the Gelug became established Tsangpa policy.Kapstein 2006, p. 135 As part of a resolution negotiated by Ch√∂j√© Taklung, Ganden Phodrang's representative Sonam Rapten, being treasurer, had to arrange a ransom payment for the sacked monasteries of Drepung and Sera. He had to deliver, under escort, 300 gold coins (200 for Drepung and 100 for Sera) to Tsang, to the west of Lhasa. Since both monasteries' funds had been exhausted, the resourceful Sonam Rapten said he would have to collect the gold from the previous Dalai Lamas' secret reserve at 'Gyel', or Chokkor Gyel. This monastery, built by the Second Dalai Lama near Lhamo Lhatso 'Oracle Lake', is a few days journey to the east. It was agreed, but then, soon after leaving Lhasa for Gyel, Sonam Rapten evaded his Tsangpa escort and went to Mongolia via Nyangt√∂ and Kongpo.Shakabpa 2010, p. 328, note 3, pp. 375 & 1141, Drakg√∂n K√∂nchog Tenpa Rapgy√©, Ocean Annals, vol.1 70-3, Religious History of Dom√©, mdo smad chos 'byung deb ther rgya mtsho, TBRC #W28064 Discovery of the Fifth Dalai Lama In Dukula, the 5th Dalai Lama's autobiography volume I, Sonam Rapten is first mentioned as taking up residence in the Ganden Phodrang in 1621.Karmay 2014, p.46 In the meantime, since the 1618 incidents he had secretly searched for and identified the reincarnation of the Fourth Dalai Lama. Then, in 1619, in the face of active hostility from the King of Tsang he secretly traveled to Kokonor to seek military support from the Mongol leaders there, returning to the Ganden Phodrang in 1621 as confirmed in the Dukula. Having been the Fourth Dalai Lama's Chagdzo at a young age, after his death early in 1617 Sonam Rapten had been \\"anxiously searching for the reincarnation of the omniscient Fourth Dalai Lama\\",Shakabpa 2010, p. 331 despite the Tsangpa King placing a ban upon the search.Karmay 2009, p. 506 At this time the King, under the influence of the older sects and bearing a personal grudge against the Fourth Dalai Lama,Shakabpa 2010, p. 315 actively opposed the Gelugpa school. Preventing the re-discovery of their most popular and important lama would have been a major drawback, \\"the most cruel blow\\" for the Gelugpa, effectively \\"blocking the foundation of the emerging political and spiritual spirit and stamina of Ganden Phodrang and Gelugpa supremacy\\".Dhondup 1984, pp. 13-14 The Gelugpa did not renounce the search, however; in defiance of the ban, Sonam Rapten and his team after covertly consulting two oracles for pointers secretly identified the probable reincarnation, a boy who had been born late in 1617 at Chonggy√© in the Yarlung Valley.Mullin 2001, p. 189 This discovery was made in 1619.Shakabpa 1984, p. 101 Secret Confirmation by senior lamas' divinations It was 1620 and tension between the powerful Tsangpa faction and the Gelugpa in Lhasa and their Mongolian allies was building up again. After Sonam Rapten's secret visit to Kokonor, Mongol soldiers had filtered back into Tibet and eventually succeeded in making a surprise attack on the Tsangpa's military camps in Lhasa.Kapstein 2006, pp. 135-136 Soon, by the timely intervention of the Panchen Lama and the Ganden Tripa further hostilities were avoided and a favourable peace treaty was negotiated.Mullin 2001, p. 190 It was then decided that the Panchen Lama and Lingm√© Zhapdrung should draw lots to choose the child. They went to Radeng monastery to divine by the dough-ball method which of the three candidates was the reincarnation. Lots were ritually drawn before the sacred image of Jowo Jampel Dorj√©, and Sonam Rapten's candidate, K√ºnga Migyur from Chonggy√©, was duly chosen.Karmay 2009, pp. 506-7 Meanwhile, the Panchen Lama had also lobbied the Tsangpa King to lift the ban on finding the Fifth Dalai Lama.Karmay 2009, p. 507 =Ban lifted, appointed to chagdzo= Hostilities having ceased, the ban was liftedRichardson 1998, p. 427 and the tulku was duly installed at Drepung monastery in 1622 in his 5th year and given the new name of Lobsang Gyatso.Karmay 2014, pp. 46-47 From that time on, Sonam Rapten, 22 years his senior, was his chagdzo (guardian, manager and chief attendant) and eventually, from 1642, his viceroy or prime minister - the Desi, de facto ruler of Tibet.Karmay 2014, chapters 4-30 =Different accounts of object- recognition test= There are differing accounts concerning at what point the young Fifth Dalai Lama candidate was subjected to an object-recognition test. This involved him being asked by an official to choose or identify certain personal items that had belonged to his predecessor from a selection of objects which included other items that had not. The accounts also differ about the place where the test took place, whether his eventual tutor Kachuwa or Sonam Rapten carried it out and also whether the candidate passed the test. Those sources which assert that Sonam Rapten personally subjected the boy to the test early, before he left Chonggy√© and before lots were drawn at Radeng also say that he passed the test without hesitation.Dhondup 1984, p.15 The account on the Dalai Lama's official website concurs with this version. In ‚Äò‚ÄôDukula‚Äô‚Äô, however, the Fifth Dalai Lama himself recalls that the tests were done after lots had been drawn, that they took place at Nakartse and he frankly admits \\"I could utter no words to recognise [any of the objects]\\". This does not rule out the possibility that he did recognise them but was unable to say so. He witnesses that in any case, when his examiner Kachuwa went out of the room to report the result to the other officials he declared \\"I am absolutely convinced that he recognised the objects\\".Karmay 2014, p. 48 Mullin's account concurs with this version, being taken from the same source.Mullin 2001, p. 191 It is also quite possible from these accounts that the test was carried out twice, once by Sonam Rapten before lots were drawn, when the infant was too young to recall the test, and also, according with Tibetan lore, still young enough to retain the memory of the objects from his previous life; and once by Kachuwa afterwards when he was old enough to remember the occasion of the test later, but, according to Tibetan lore, at the time unable or not young enough to remember the objects from his previous life. Relations with Fifth Dalai Lama, 1622-1658 When the Fifth Dalai Lama, aged 4, was installed at Drepung in 1622 it was Sonam Rapten as head administrator of the Ganden Phodrang who became his Chagdzo, Principal Attendant, responsible for his upbringing, management and safety. It is normal practice for an important lama's Chagdzo to exercise more or less total control over his charge in childhood and often to maintain such control long after the lama's maturity, dominating him and running all his affairs, as Sonam Rapten did. In case of the lama's death, the Chagdzo is often placed in charge of the search for his reincarnation, as Sonam Rapten had done earlier as the Fourth Dalai Lama's former chagdzo when the latter died. Amongst other duties the Chagdzo controls all the money and property and is referred to as the 'treasurer'. He takes care of public relations, controlling who can and who cannot have an audience with the lama. He organises the lama's travels, accommodations, building and publishing projects and all the lama's engagements, including his private and public teachings, and Sonam Rapten took care of all such work with consummate skill. The Chagdzo also takes care of the lama's family affairs. For example, in 1626 the Dalai Lama's father, Dudul Rapten (aka Hor Dudul Dorj√©) died, possibly murdered, in the prison of the Tsangpa King, without having seen his son since he was an infant. His corpse was thrown out behind Zamkhar Castle and \\"a sage from Chonggy√© took the body away\\". It was Sonam Rapten who took responsibility to arrange for the proper and necessary funeral rites to be performed on Dudul Rapten's behalf at local monasteries.Shakabpa 2010, p. 332 Sonam Rapten, being a monk also sometimes gave spiritual advice to the boy, although he was not one of his formal religious tutors. In 1626 Sonam Rapten saw the 8 year old Dalai Lama was becoming interested in a text on Hayagriva so he referred him to Lingm√© Zhapdrung Konchog Chophel, the 35th Ganden Tripa, who began to mentor him on this subject.Karmay 1988, p. 28 Responsibility for all affairs of state Rapten was a dynamic character and in practice, on a day-to-day basis more powerful than his master, dealing with nobles, royalty and political leaders including foreign ones and routinely making critical decisions in all matters without reference to the Dalai Lama.Mullin 2001, pp. 198-199 In 1641, against the lama's wishes he even launched a full-scale civil war.Shakabpa 1984 p. 106 et seq Although Sonam Rapten as 'Regent' is generally accorded the title \\"Desi\\" by historians, in practice the 5th Dalai Lama in The Dukula addressed him as \\"Zhalngo\\" ('The Presence') and also refers to him as the \\"Depa\\", but never as \\"Desi\\".Karmay 2014, Chapters 4-30 The title of Desi was not in use in the time of the Fifth Dalai Lama, \\"for whom it may have had too strong overtones of independent authority\\"; it was only applied retroactively to Sonam Rapten and his successors in histories written later.Richardson 1998, p. 449 After the 1641-42 Civil War, the Mongol Gushri Khan (with whose military assistance the Gelugpa had by then defeated the Tsangpa) was content to act as head of security, ready to protect the new regime as and when requested, while Sonam Rapten was responsible for the conduct of secular business. In the Fifth Dalai Lama's later decree appointing Sangye Gyatso as his 'regent' in 1679, he recalls in the preamble that earlier, \\"Depa Sonam Rapten had carried out the task of regent for all secular affairs\\".Richardson 1998, p. 444 =Dalai Lama's habitual deference towards him= Moreover, the Fifth Dalai Lama found worldly affairs distasteful and much preferred to study spiritual subjects. He allowed Sonam Rapten to do as he liked, choosing to defer to him as a matter of course.Karmay 2014, p. 172 Nevertheless, he somewhat ruefully mentions being ignored or overruled sometimes, e.g. Sonam Rapten's denying his long- time wish to make a new crown for a favourite statue, as it was costly and would earn no recognition; only after Sonam Rapten's funeral in 1659 could he start making the crown.Karmay 2014, p. 406 A passage in The Dukula for 1654 laments his frustrations and the extent to which he had to defer to Sonam Rapten's oversight even on spiritual issues; this passage also gives an example and shows Sonam Rapten's younger brother and deputy Depa Norbu's inconsiderate attitude towards him: =Their rare policy disagreements= Over the 36 years they spent working together, from 1622 to 1658, as exceptions prove the rule there were a few instances whereby Sonam Rapten's policies were challenged by the Dalai Lama. Two major examples of this are firstly in 1639-1641 when the latter strongly disagreed with Sonam Rapten's urge to attack the Tsangpa, to no avail,Shakabpa 1984, pp. 106-108 and secondly just as he was leaving Tibet to visit the Shunzhi Emperor of China in 1653 the lama issued a decree to repeal and prohibit any further promulgation of the \\"gross\\" sectarian practices carried out under Sonam Rapten's rule, policies which, it appears, might have been in force for a decade (details below).Karmay 2014, pp. 269-270 1621: He recruits Mongol fighters After his attack on Lhasa in 1618, the Tsangpa King established military bases to blockade Drepung and Sera monasteries and thus control the city. A year later, the Mongol soldiers expelled from Tibet by the Tsangpa in 1605 started filtering back into Tibet in the guise of pilgrims and camped some distance outside the city.Shakabpa 1984, pp. 100-101 The 23-year-old Sonam Rapten contacted them and kept in clandestine touch hoping to engineer a counter- attack by the Mongols against the Tsangpa camps at some point. It took till 1621, when the Mongol cavalry suddenly attacked and routed the by then complacent Tsangpa.Dhondup 1984, pp. 15-16 Faced with all-out war as the Mongols prepared to follow up the attack and the Tsangpa king called up reinforcements, the Panchen Lama and the Ganden Tripa skilfully intervened to negotiate a cease-fire and a Tsangpa surrender whereby the remnants of the army returned to Tsang. Moreover, full reparations for the 1618 attack were to be made by the Tsangpa and Sonam Rapten was 'allowed' to remain at the Ganden Phodrang.Dhondup 1984, pp. 16 In 1622, the old Tsangpa King was succeeded by his young son, allowing Sonam Rapten to reveal the four year old Fifth Dalai Lama who was brought out of hiding and installed at Drepung. When the Mongols demanded to take him away to Mongolia, Sonam Rapten and his helpers had to hide him away in southern Tibet for another year.Shakabpa 1984, p. 102 His young charge was made Abbot of Drepung and became immersed in his studies, so Sonam Rapten who managed the affairs of monastery on his behalf became used to wielding the power of the throne behind the scenes.Karmay 1988, p. 7 Mongol campaigns in Tibet, 1632-1638 The Tsangpa King P√ºntsok Namgyel died in 1620 or 1621 and was succeeded by his son Karma Tenkyong Wangpo. Even more belligerent and sectarian than his father, after a relatively peaceful decade he resolved to extend his rule and persecuted Gelugpa monasteries wherever he could.Mullin 2001, p. 196 To ensure ultimate victory, in 1632 he started assembling 'an army from the thirteen myriarchies [of Tibet]' and eventually enlisted Choghtu Khong Tayiji and Ligden Khan, leaders of the fierce, anti- Gelugpa Chahar and Khalkha Mongol tribes, as allies. They plotted to invade Tibet, attack the Gelugpa and 'wipe them out' with the help of the Bonpo King of Beri in Kham and the army of the Tsangpa King. Hearing of this, the Gelugpa abbots and patrons, in a panic, realising the defenceless Gelugpa school was threatened with attacks by these powerful forces from three different sides, convened an emergency meeting with Sonam Rapten to find a way to prevent the extinction of their sect. The Khalkha and B√∂n Donyo were already attempting to join forces with the Tsangpa 'to obstruct commercial traffic and pilgrimage routes and to steal from pilgrims'. The very existence of the Gelugpa was felt to be like \\"a butter-lamp flickering in the wind\\".Shakabpa 1984, pp. 102-103Dhondup 1984, p. 17Shakabpa 2010, p. 323 and pp. 333-335 This crucial conference was held at the historic house called Chudingn√© where the patrons of the Ganden Phodrang would gather.Shakabpa 2010, p. 53, note 103, p. 103 They made offerings to the Lamo Tsangpa Oracle, seeking a divination to resolve their plight. The Oracle advised them, 'because of their powerlessness', to go and ask the four Oirat Mongol tribes for help.Shakabpa 2010, p. 285 The meeting therefore resolved that Sonam Rapten and Garu Lotsawa should go to Mongolia to solicit these tribes, who were Gelugpa converts, to come to their aid. By 1634 Sonam Rapten had recruited the Oirats, Dzungars and Urluks, who were just as fierce as the Khalkhas and Chahars and who vowed to assist. Together the tribal leaders deputed Gushri Khan, Chief of the Oirat Khoshut tribe to lead a combined Gelugpa Mongol army to Tibet in defence of the Gelugpa. Sonam Rapten returned to Lhasa with the good news and Gushri Khan travelled to Tibet disguised as a pilgrim to reconnoitre the situation. In the resulting campaigns over the next 4 years he and his army eliminated all his anti-Gelugpa Mongol rivals, meanwhile becoming a devoted 'heart-disciple' of the Dalai Lama. At a ceremony hosted by the Dalai Lama in Lhasa in 1638 the victorious Gushri was then honoured as a 'Religious king and defender of Buddhism'.Shakabpa 1984, pp. 103-105Dhondup 1984, pp. 18-20Shakabpa 2010, pp. 335-338 Architect of the Gelugpa/Mongol conquest of Tibet Gushri Khan and Sonam Rapten. From a mural at the Jokhang Temple, Lhasa. Photo: Brian J. McMorrow Sonam Rapten, however, was not satisfied. He was now determined to launch the victorious ally Gushri and his Mongol army against the burgeoning Lhasa Gelugpa's two main deadly political and religious rivals and enemies: Donyo Dorje, Bonpo King of Beri in Do Kham in the east, and then the Tsangpa regime to the west. Donyo Dorje had not only persecuted all the Buddhist schools but he was alleged to have made a pact with the Tsangpa to attack the Lhasa Gelugpa from both sides to crush and destroy them once and for all. Gushri Khan was ready to do as Sonam Rapten proposed but the Fifth Dalai Lama forbade it. He ruled that there had been enough bloodshed already and it was not necessary to compete with and attack other Tibetan leaders or parties.Dhondup 1984, pp. 20-21 He defies the Dalai Lama by going to war The politically ambitious Sonam Rapten, however, insisted on taking advantage of the availability of Gushri and his victorious army to establish a greater Gelugpa supremacy.Richardson 1998, p. 388 He rejected the Dalai Lama's wish for peaceful co-existence; saying the Gelugpa had been unduly persecuted, his vision for peace was to forcibly unite the country under the titular leadership of the Fifth Dalai Lama instead of letting it remain fragmented under different warlords and religious leaders. Maintaining that all the Gelugpa had lacked was a strong backer, he was insistent that full use should be made of Gushri Khan's devoted military support while it was available.Shakabpa 1984, p. 106 The powerful Bonpo King of Beri, Donyo Dorje was inimical towards all Buddhists and had killed and imprisoned many monks and laymen of all schools in Chamdo. In the summer of 1639, Sonam Rapten, in front of the Dalai Lama and without consulting him, told Kachu Genyen Dondrub to go to G√ºshri Khan with clear instructions to destroy Beri and then return to his base in Amdo, adding ‚Äòno further conflicts would interest us‚Äô. When the messenger departed, however, Sonam Rapten accompanied him on his way, stopping at Chabtengkha to speak alone with him \\"for the period of two tea- times\\".Karmay 2014, p. 148-149 By the end of 1640 the Beri King had been defeated and killed after a hard-fought campaign.Shakabpa 2010, p. 340 To proclaim and celebrate G√ºshri's victory Sonam Rapten hoisted flags of good tidings in the four directions around LhasaShakabpa 2010, p. 341 and caused the \\"Great Banner of Power and Fortune\\" to be raised at the central western gate of Lhasa called Sapokgang.Shakabpa 2010, p. 52 Sonam Rapten soon proposed that G√ºshri Khan should now march to Tsang with his army and attack the King, but the Dalai Lama disagreed, saying he did not want any more people killed.Shakabpa 1984, p. 107 After defeating Donyo Dorje and releasing the prisoners, the Dalai Lama wanted Gushri to return direct to Mongolia, taking his army with him, as Rapten had arranged. Sonam Rapten, however, had already deceived the Dalai Lama by covertly sending to G√ºshri Khan additional verbal instructions with Kachu Genyen Dondrub to go and destroy the Tsangpa and Kagyu establishment after dealing with the Beri King.Dhondup 1984, p. 21 Referring to Sonam Rapten's underhand trick, it occurred to the infuriated Dalai Lama that \\"the trill of the flute\\" - his message of peace - had changed into \\"the whistle of an arrow\\" - instructions for war - when Rapten had talked privately to the messenger. This refers to the traditional Tibetan practice, in a situation requiring secrecy, to give the courier an additional oral message that contradicts and overrides the written one.Shakabpa 1984, p. 107, note 11 The two argued at length inconclusively and finally the Dalai Lama instructed Sonam Rapten to carry out a dice divination, which he did before the deity Pelden. The result indicated that an attack on the Tsangpa now would succeed, but that in the long term it would be harmful. Sonam Rapten declared \\"If the strategy is successful, that is enough because in the long run everyone dies\\". Therefore, he took the short term view and consented to Gushri's attack on Tsang.Shakabpa 2010, p. 342 =Civil War between Lhasa and Tsang, 1641-42= Having executed the Beri King at Chamdo and subdued Do Kham, early in 1641 Gushri followed his instructions and Rapten sent Tardongnas, a capable and high-ranking official to guide him to Shigatse.Shakabpa 1984, 108-109 The Tsangpa forces were forewarned, however. The King had not gone to the aid of his ally Donyo Dorje when G√ºshri Khan eliminated him, but now he set to organising his defence. The borders posts were guarded, the most valiant soldiers were kept at Shigatse, supplies, arms and ammunition were stockpiled and a huge stockade was erected around the castle and the monastery. By the time G√ºshri got there they were so well prepared that his men could not break the siege after a whole year of trying. Sonam Rapten had been busy travelling around √ú province to take over or harass areas ruled by the Tsangpa and he heard from his informers about Gushri's failure to capture the fort. He sent a spy inside the fort in disguise and he reported that the defences were so strong that it would be impossible to break the siege. Rapten then contritely asked the Dalai Lama to go and mediate a settlement but the Lama, infuriated again, spoke harshly to him for the first time, blaming him for the whole mess and saying it was now far too late: \\"We now must go through with this war, which you have so carelessly begun\\", he concluded.Shakabpa 2010, p.344-345Shakabpa 1984, pp. 109-110Dhondup 1984, p. 23 Stung into action, Sonam Rapten raised an army of Tibetans and captured the Dongkar Castle in one day with the help of monks from Sera and Drepung. Seeing this, a whole series of other Tsangpa-held forts surrendered one after the other.Shakabpa 2010, p. 345 He dropped Lhasa's thinly-veiled pretence of neutrality in the siege and marched on Shigatse to join Gushri with fresh provisions, fodder and weapons, helping the construction of 'giant catapults'. The siege efforts intensified and by early spring of 1642 the Tsangpa defences were broken. The King and his two main ministers capitulated and all three were imprisoned.Dhondup 1984, pp. 21-25 At this point the Dalai Lama was invited to come for the inauguration of his rule over Tibet in the great assembly hall of Samdruptse castle and the victorious Gushri and Rapten rode out to meet him, two days journey from Shigatse.Shakabpa 1984, pp. 110-111 =The final elimination of Tsangpa power= Soon after this conclusion Garpon Yapse, a follower of the Karmapa, fomented a major new uprising against the new government.Dhondup 1984, p. 26 His rapidly growing army captured the town of Gyantse and inspired a major rebellion in the region of Kongpo.Richardson 1998, p. 353Richardson 1998, p. 389 Sonam Rapten and Gushri Khan had to quell the revolt, their forces killing 7,000 to 8,000 rebels in one place and capturing many more. They then moved around southern Tibet mopping up resistance and residual rebel forces. In the course of this they captured the official cook of the Karmapa, one Jama Ch√∂ying, who was found to be wearing an amulet which contained details of a plan to eliminate the new government and replace it with Tsangpa and Karmapa supporters. It was a letter attached to an order of the Karmapa saying that G√ºshri Khan and Sonam Rapten were to be assassinated and the Panchen Lama and the Dalai Lama imprisoned in Kongpo.Shakabpa 2010, pp. 348-349Karmay 2014, pp. 175-176 As a result, the captured Tsangpa king and his chief ministers, the last vestiges of Tsangpa and Kagyu power in Tibet, were executed by the enraged Gushri Khan by being sewn up in ox-hides and thrown in the Tsangpo river, a sentence reserved in Tibet for rebellious nobles. Thus, the people experienced peace at last and after a long campaign the Karma Kagyud and the Tsangpa met the end of their rule of Central Tibet at the hands of Sonam Rapten, who \\"manipulated and blended with such subtlety, skill and intricacy the charisma of the Dalai Lama with the military might of the Mongols\\".Dhondup 1984, p. 29 Following this total elimination of regional rival powers by the Lhasa Gelugpa aided by their Mongol warriors, the administration of the entire country was fundamentally re-organised by \\"the brilliant trio\\" of the \\"Great Fifth\\" Dalai Lama, Sonam Rapten and Gushri Khan.Richardson 1998, p. 428 Name change from 'Rapten' to 'Ch√∂phel' It is stated in Kadrung Nornang's text Record of Ten Thousand Years that, after the 1642 completion of the Gelugpa/Mongol conquest of Tibet and at the time of Sonam Rapten's assumption of \\"the leadership of the government as regent\\", In Dukula, whenever the Fifth refers to him by name instead of title ('Zhalngo') he always uses 'Sonam Rapten'.Karmay 2014, p. 46 et seq Apart from Richardson, who follows the Fifth's example,Richardson 1998, p. 447 most other sources, including Shakabpa, Dhondup and Mullin, always refer to him by his later name of 'S√∂nam Ch√∂phel' or similar. It is suggested by Richardson that perhaps the name- change was effected by G√ºshri Khan in 1637 on the occasion of titles being exchanged between the Tibetan and Mongolian leaders, however there is no mention of this in the sources,Karmay 2014, p. 130 on the contrary it is stated that the title conferred on Rapten on that occasion was \\"Dalai Chagdzo\\". According to the above quoted text the change to 'Ch√∂pel' took place in 1642. De facto ruler of Tibet Sonam Rapten \\"assumed the leadership of the government as the regent under the Dalai Lama\\" as soon as the latter had been commonly acknowledged as titular head of state by the assembled Tibetan and Mongolian leaders and masses in a solemn ceremony held at Samdruptse (Shigatse) castle in April, 1642.Shakabpa 2010, pp. 347-348 Some accounts say Gushri Khan was \\"King of Tibet\\" and that Rapten was 'proclaimed by Gushri Khan as regent, responsible for political administration'.Dhondup 1984, p. 25 Stein goes so far as to say that he was nominated by Gushri as a governor and 'imposed' on the Dalai Lama.Stein 1972, p. 83 According to Richardson, Petech asserts Gushri appointed Rapten as 'minister-regent' to conduct civil affairs even before he 'offered the sovereignty to the Dalai Lama'; also that Tucci thought this was Gushri's way of controlling Tibet through Rapten, setting the stage for a power struggle between Gushri and a \\"crafty and ambitious\\" Dalai Lama; Tucci even describes Rapten as 'an insignificant character whom the Dalai Lama had no difficulty in dominating'. Richardson, however, considered it difficult to reconcile Rapten's unremittingly domineering pro-Gelugpa activity pre-1642 with a sudden lapse into nonentity from that date on.Richardson 1998, p. 448 The accounts of Stein, Petech and Tucci are also offset by the facts that firstly, Rapten's successors (Depa Norbu, Trinley Gyatso, Lozang Thutop, Lozang Jinpa and Sangye Gyatso) were all appointed by the Dalai Lama himselfShakabpa 2010, p. 1133 and none of them were as strong as Sonam Rapten.Mullin 2001, p. 210 Secondly in Dukula the Fifth Dalai Lama describes in detail the process of his own assumption of power before the great assembly at Samdruptse castle in 1642 without referring to G√ºshri Khan as being instrumental in it. In addition there is no reference at all about Sonam Rapten having any change in his previous status as his chagdzo, charged with day-to-day administrative and political matters on his behalf. After describing the assembly of Tibetan and Mongolian leaders and the masses of monks and lay people in the great hall of the castle, the Fifth Dalai Lama simply notes that \\"With these gifts, it was proclaimed that the political authority over the 13 Myriarchies of Tibet [i.e. the whole of Tibet], led by the estate of Samdruptse, were in their totality offered to me\\".Karmay 2014, p. 166 On the contrary, having returned to √ú the Dalai Lama describes how Rapten exhorted him strongly to stay in Lhasa now (rather than at Drepung) and take over more political responsibilities from him, whilst still offering to continue to serve him and 'not do less than before'. The Dalai Lama, feeling \\"if only I could devote myself to [religious/philosophical] study\\", responded by flatly refusing to deal with anything administrative or political since he had \\"no capacity of doing anything, either mentally or physically\\". In Dukula, which is normally quite detailed and specific in such matters, there is no indication that Sonam Rapten underwent any change of status, duty or responsibility, during or after the Dalai Lama's assumption of full political and religious power over Tibet; Rapten is consistently framed as the ruler taking the pre-eminent role in political affairs.Karmay 2014, Chapter 16, especially pp. 166, 172 Although Gushri Khan and his successors are commonly referred to as 'Kings', they assumed a subservient position to those of the Dalai Lama and Sonam Rapten in formal seating arrangements; their status as 'Kings' seems to have referred more to their Mongol subjects than to the Tibetans. Gushri sent his troops to the Dalai Lama and Sonam Rapten whenever they were needed and had facilitated the establishment of the Dalai Lama's rule over Tibet, but by all accounts, Gushri \\"neither interfered in the administration nor tried to control its policies. All power and authority ultimately lay in the hands of the Dalai Lama, right up to the time of his death\\".Shakabpa 1984, p. 124 Mullin also characterises the Dalai Lama's role as that of a 'figurehead', while Sonam Rapten acted as 'de facto ruler' and only referred matters to the Dalai Lama on major issues or when he was in doubt; which was not very often.Mullin 2001, p. 206 His activities as ruler of Tibet In 1643, Sonam Rapten began organising a census to be carried out, starting with the provinces of Tod to the north and Tsang to the east,Shakabpa 1984, p.112 and formulating taxation laws.Dhondup 1984, pp. 27-28 He commissioned a detailed survey of the land and the population and gradually appointed officials to assess taxes. Construction of Potala Palace In 1645 Sonam Rapten met with the Dalai Lama and Gushri Khan and they decided to construct the Potala Palace. They visited the proposed site together and arranged consecration rituals to prepare for construction to begin. The initial external structure of the 'White Palace' part was built over the next three years with the help of indentured labour from √ú Tsang and the Dalai Lama moved into it in 1649.Shakabpa 2010, p. 351 His invasions of Bhutan In 1643 when Sonam Rapten and Gushri Khan were visiting Lhodrak (an area adjoining the border with Bhutan) they heard that Monpa communities on Tibet's borders with Nepal and Bhutan were encountering problems from the Bhutanese.Shakabpa 2010, pp. 349-350 This gave an excuse for what Richardson called Sonam Rapten's repeated invasions of Bhutan: \\"those frequent and unrewarding campaigns the Gelugpa regime thought it necessary to undertake against Bhutan as the bastion of the older sects.\\"Richardson 1998, p. 450 Modern Bhutan was founded by Ngawang Namgyal of the Drukpa Kagyu school who fled Tibet in 1616 when faced with arrest by the Tsangpa King over a dispute about the authenticity of his claimed status as the incarnation of the Fourth Drukchen. Once welcomed into exile by the Bhutanese he assumed national leadership by popular acclaim and consolidated the Himalayan country in its modern form.Phuntsho 2013, pp. 158-162 Sonam Rapten's sectarian policies which were highlighted in 1652 by the Fifth Dalai Lama's decree proscribing them indicate the possibility that the over-ambitious Rapten wished to subdue and assimilate Bhutan into Tibet in order to convert 'wayward' Drukpa Kagyu followers to the Gelugpa tradition, while also bringing Bhutan itself under Ganden Phodrang control. Until then, his Mongol army had been invincible, defeating all anti- or non-Gelugpa leaders in Lhasa, √ú, Amdo, Kham, Tsang, Kongpo and elsewhere in southern Tibet. Bhutan must have seemed an easy target by comparison. =The 1644 expedition= In 1644 Sonam Rapten therefore despatched an expeditionary force of 700 Mongolians plus Tibetan forces into Bhutan, on the excuse of assisting the Monpas, but they found the southern passes were heavily fortified by Bhutanese forces. Though Rapten's army soon captured Kawang Dzong, the soldiers were unaccustomed to the terrain and the climate and the army suffered defeat and humiliation at the hands of the Bhutanese,Shakabpa 2010, p. 350 shattering the myth of the Mongolian fighters' invincibility. After surrendering, Tibet's three leading officers were held hostage in order to guarantee non-aggression.Shakabpa 2010, p. 350, quoting Extensive Biography of Ngawang Namgyal by Pelden Gyatso, f114-na-4 Weapons, armour, equipment, supplies and animals were all confiscated. The disarmed soldiers, however, were escorted back to the Tibet border and freed by the Bhutanese.Phuntsho 2013, pp. 244-245Shakabpa 2010, p. 350-351 In 1646 Sonam Rapten negotiated a peace treaty with Bhutan to release the hostages. The previous status quo and original borders were restituted and both sides committed themselves to harmonious coexistence. The Bhutanese also undertook to pay annual tribute of \\"the rich offering of rice\\" which they had previously made to the Tsangpa King to the Ganden Phodrang instead.Shakabpa 2010, pp. 351-352Shakabpa 1984, p. 113 =The 1648 invasion= The hostages were sent back \\"with gifts\\" in 1647, as agreed, but early in 1648 Sonam Rapten broke the 1646 treaty by ordering a new, three-pronged invasion of Bhutan with his brother Depa Norbu in command of the main army. It was supposedly a well- organised and well-prepared expedition.Phuntsho 2013, pp. 245-247 This attempt met with an even worse fate that the first one with Norbu's column 'escaping in terror', causing the other columns to retreat as well. Again, most of the armour, weapons and supplies were lost to the Bhutanese. This embarrassing defeat was considered a 'disgraceful' one in Tibetan history and Norbu was accused of 'secret dealings' (i.e. treachery) with the Bhutanese.Shakabpa 2010, p. 352Karmay 2014, p. 215 In Dukula the Dalai Lama notes that the invasion plan was proceeding well when Norbu \\"precipitously deserted and ran away, losing his saddle and most of his armaments\\" and necessitating a difficult withdrawal to be made by the other two armies. Gushri and Sonam Rapten returned to Lhasa after monitoring the Bhutan campaign from the border. =The 1656 invasion= See section below on \\"His last years\\". =Use of magical means, the occult and oracles in the Bhutanese campaigns= Ngawang Namgyal's success and his decisive victories over the Tibetan attempts to subdue Bhutan in 1644 and 1648 [he died in 1651]Phuntsho 2013, pp. 244-249 were attributed to his effective use of occult powers, rather than to superior Bhutanese prowess in battle alone.Aris 1979, pp. 230-231 Namgyal's biography by Pelden Gyatso gives graphic details of how rites performed by the Bhutanese protected them in the second invasion (1648) and caused the well-armed Tibetan forces to be repelled and routed.Shakabpa 2010, pp. 352-353, quoting Extensive Biography of Ngawang Namgyal by Pelden Gyatso, f135-na-6 Proof that such means were both used and feared is also found in the terms of the peace treaty signed between Bhutan and the Tsangpa King after the latter's failed invasion of Bhutan in 1639, in which Ngawang Namgyal's only concession to the Tsangpa was \\"to promise to forego further acts of black magic in the event of a satisfactory conclusion to the dispute\\". In return for this promise alone, the Tsangpa King completely capitulated, even ceding a piece of his territory to Bhutan in addition.Aris 1979, p. 223 Similarly, as a last resort during the 1639-42 Tibetan civil wars, Sonam Rapten had employed the use of magic rituals. Being a Gelugpa supremacist it was with reluctance that he requested Nyingma rituals to be performed by the Fifth Dalai Lama and his 'root guru', the renowned Nyingma master Zur Choying Rangdrol, to apparent great effect (see next section for details).Karmay 2014, pp. 149-152, Chapter 15Dudjom 1991, pp. 682-683 Again, in 1650 or 1651, Sonam Rapten requested Zur to arrange just such an occult rite against Bhutan at Phagri (near the border), a ritual which was said to have soon caused the death of his arch-enemy, the master of magic, Drukpa Kagyu chieftain Ngawang Namgyal. On his sudden death from unknown causes four month later (although his death was kept a secret for 50 yearsImaeda, 2013), Sonam Rapten complimented Zur and his assistant on the efficacy of their magical rites, saying \\"Signs were quickly produced!\\"Karmay 2014, p. 235 Divinations and prophecies elicited from spirit oracles via their mediums also played an essential part in these struggles and some Tibetan failures in Bhutan are said to have occurred after the oracle's advice was sought but its warnings were ignored.Shakabpa 2010, p. 361 Sectarian policies - countered by Fifth Dalai Lama Although during his youth the Dalai Lama was consistently friendly and conciliatory towards the Tsangpa King, sectarian friction between the Kagyupa in Tsang and the Gelugpa in √ú under Sonam Rapten nevertheless continued to simmer until it boiled over into the civil war of 1641-42.Karmay 1988, pp. 7-8 At the same time Sonam Rapten had to deal with Donyo Dorje, the Bonpo King of Beri in Kham who was the sworn enemy of all Buddhist schools and whose particular hatred for the Gelugpa made him even tougher. He had persecuted, killed and imprisoned many lamas, monks, officers and laymen of the Gelugpa, Karmapa, Drugpa, Drikhungka and Taglungpa schools.Dhondup 1984, pp. 21-22 Against Sonam Rapten and his Lhasa Gelugpa, Dorje was a military ally of the Tsangpa King, who had encouraged Dorje to attack Gelugpa monasteries in Kham, such as Lithang, and to persecute the monks there.Shakabpa 1984, p. 103 Then in 1629 someone leaked a confidential message, carried by a merchant called Dralha Jengyidong, from the Beri King to the Tsangpa King confirming their agreement to secretly raise their armies in order to attack the Lhasa Gelugpa from both sides the following year, hopefully putting an end to the Gelugpa school for once and for all.Karmay 2014, p. 151 (Dukula pp. 197-198)Dhondup 1984, p. 20Shakabpa 1984, pp. 105-106Shakabpa 2010, pp. 338-339 Sonam Rapten was a staunch Gelugpa fanatic. He frowned upon the lifelong interest in non-Gelugpa religious traditions expressed by the Fifth Dalai Lama, whose earliest childhood memories from home were of traditional rituals, which he imitated, making tormas and pretending to play ritual instruments; he was fascinated by Bonpo tantrists rather than worldly matters and liked listening to Indian yogis talk, and stories of gods, ghosts and spirits. In fact, the Dalai Lama considered himself to have been reborn from ‚Äòa black tantrist or a hungry Indian teacher‚Äô. By the time he reached 20 his growing attraction to magic ritual led him to study the magic tantric rites of the Nyingma tradition under the renowned Nyingma ritual master Zur Choying Rangdrol. Then in 1638, when he took full Gelugpa ordination, Sonam Rapten put his foot down and insisted that his studies under the Nyingma master must now be curtailed. The young Dalai Lama reluctantly deferred to him and stopped his non-Gelugpa activities.Karmay 1988, p. 8Karmay 2014, pp. 7, 8, 45, 121, 127, 134 Despite his fanaticism, however, Sonam Rapten was also a pragmatist. Two years later, in 1640, he was begging the Dalai Lama to carry out suitable magic Nyingma rituals to help defeat Donyo Dorje. On learning of the Beri King's secret alliance with the Tsangpa King against the Lhasa Gelugpa he had sent G√ºshri and his Mongol army to Kham to pre-empt their plot. The Dalai Lama had not agreed to this attack and at first he refused to help, making various excuses and pointing out that Rapten did not approve of magic rituals, having earlier curtailed his studies of them under Zur. Perhaps sardonically, he suggested Sonam Rapten should do the Gelugpa rite of Yamantaka, the wrathful form of Manjushri. Losing patience, Sonam Rapten pointed out that the practice of Yamantaka had failed to prevent the disastrous attacks on Lhasa by the Tsangpa forces in 1618. He expressed his contempt for Nyingma practices telling him curtly: ‚ÄúSo practise Nyingma, then! The proverb says: ‚ÄòIf it heals the wound, even dog fat is fine!‚Äô‚Äù On this, the Dalai Lama comments wryly in his Dukula: ‚ÄúAnother proverb says: ‚ÄòWhen one needs stone, it is the Lord of Stone; when not, it is merely a lump of rock!‚Äô‚Äù In any case he relented, consulted Zur and performed an elaborate rite, which seems to have been successful. The Bonpo King was duly defeated and executed and all his prisoners released.Karmay 2014, pp. 147-154Dhondup 1984, p. 22 The Dalai Lama firmly opposed an attack on Tsang, pointing out that the persecution that Sonam Rapten complained about so much was merely retaliation for the Gelugpa‚Äôs past aggressive actions and provocative behaviour against the other schools; they had brought it upon themselves, he said, adding \\"the lamas of the Sakya, Karmapa and Jonang schools were the Tsangpa King‚Äôs three root-gurus, so why should we vie for their position?\\"Karmay 2014, p. 148 But Sonam Rapten took no notice. He was supposed to have instructed G√ºshri Khan to return to Amdo with his army after defeating Donyo Dorje, but now that war was won his deception was revealed. Behind his master‚Äôs back he had authorised G√ºshri to attack and destroy the Tsangpa King and his anti-Gelugpa religious allies instead of retiring to Amdo. Soon, when things were again not going as well as Sonam Rapten hoped, the Dalai Lama, with Zur, was having to carry out more magic Nyingma rituals to support the rash aggression and avoid defeat.Karmay 1988, pp.9, 29Karmay 2014, pp. 154, 157-158, 160-161 After the rebellion in Kongpo was quelled in 1642, with Sonam Rapten's approval thirteen monasteries in Kongpo and in Tsang were closed down by order of the Dalai Lama as political punishment for their military support of the rebellion. This was done to ensure future national stability and to dissuade monks from monasteries of all schools from breaking their vows by engaging in warfare. These 13 included Kagyu monasteries affiliated to the Tsangpa King as well as the prestigious Jonangpa Monastery, probably Tagten Damcho Ling (rtag brtan dam chos gling) which was founded by Taranatha in 1615, closed down in 1642 and re-opened as a Gelugpa monastery called Ganden Phuntsok Ling in 1650. The Karmapa himself felt obliged to flee to the far east of Tibet and wandered abroad and in the provinces for the next 20 years.Mullin 2001, pp. 207-208Dhondup, 1984, p. 27 The Dalai Lama himself was completely non-sectarian. He had various teachers belonging to the Nyingma, Kagyu and Sakya traditions, much to the distaste of many Gelugpa purists especially Sonam Rapten.Dhondup 1984, p. 27Mullin 2001, p. 208Amongst his non- Gelugpa teachers listed in the Collected Works of the 5th Dalai Lama, TBRC, W294-1813, 1814 were: Zur Choying Rangdrol (1604-1657), Nyingma; Khonton Paljor Lhundrub (1561-1637), Nyingma and Gelug; Rigdzin Ngaggi Wangpo (1580-1639), Nyingma; Gonpo Sonam Chogden (1603-1659), Sakya; and Tratshangpa Lodroe Choggi Dorje (1595-1671), Sakya. He also wrote biographies of all these non-Gelugpa masters. In addition he adopted the Drigung Kagyu hierarch Ch√∂ki Drakpa (Chos kyi grags pa 1595-1659) as his teacher, as described in Karmay 2014, page 370 et seq. Not only that but he was the first Tibetan Buddhist leader to recognise the Yungdrung Bon as Tibet‚Äôs native religion and describes it as being the ‚Äúholder of secret mantras ‚Äù when he issued the edict to appoint Sangye Gyatso as the Desi in 1679, addressing all the people of Tibet including \\"The Everlasting Bon, holder of the secret mantras\\".Richardson 1998, pp. 441, 444 He even gave a tract of land to Muslim traders so they could practise their religion when in Tibet and eventually he legally banned sectarianism in Tibet by issuing a decree to proscribe it (see below), passing laws to ensure freedom of religion. He kept a Bonpo lama in his entourage to ensure the interests of the Bonpo were properly upheld. After the 1648 invasion of Bhutan, however, more Kagyu monasteries were seized and converted to Gelugpa but the reasons for this are unclear.Shakabpa 2010, p. 353 It seems that the Gelugpa administration headed by Sonam Rapten definitely carried out sectarian activities and persecuted other schools, at least until the Fifth Dalai Lama issued his decree forbidding all such sectarianism just before his departure to meet the Shunzhi Emperor in the summer of 1652. The emperor had sent several envoys to Lhasa to invite the Dalai Lama to Beijing from 1649 onwards. He finally accepted and set off in 1652, accompanied as far as Nyukl√© Lating by Sonam Rapten.Shakabpa 2010, pp. 353-354 Four days earlier, at Gekya- ngo, he had given a list of parting instructions to Sonam Rapten, described in Dukula as follows: With this decree, the Dalai Lama accused Sonam Rapten and his subordinates (referred to as \\"Many of our major and minor figures [who] had given their approval for this and even made pleas (for this policy)\\") of implementing sectarian policies, and ordered him and them to cease and desist: monks from sects other than the Gelugpa had not been allowed to wear their traditional style of hats that showed which sect they belonged to; there were mechanisms in place to systematically convert and absorb the other sects into the Gelugpa so they would disappear; there was a ban in place to prevent other sets from recruiting new monks; and there was a ban on maintenance of temples built by pre-Gelugpa sects to \\"tame the ground\\" on Tibet's borderlands and they needed restoration. All these measures can be fairly ascribed to Sonam Rapten‚Äôs influence. When the Fifth Dalai Lama returned from Beijing 17 months later in December 1653, he was met at Gamo,Karmay 2014, p. 324 six days travel from Lhasa,Shakabpa 1984, p. 117 by Sonam Rapten amongst a group of not only Gelugpa lamas but also \\"the lamas and incarnations of (the Gelugpa), Drigung Kagy√º and Taklung Kagy√º and so forth\\".Shakabpa 2010, p. 358 This indicates that Sonam Rapten had taken the decree to heart and mended his sectarian ways. In addition, as mentioned in the Karmapa‚Äôs biography, following a petition by Gyaltsab Rinpoche the twenty-one most important Kagyu monasteries that had been seized by the Geluk in 1648, including Tsurphu and Yangpachen, were given back to the school soon after Lobzang Gyatso's return.Richardson 1998, pp. 354, 428 and 511, in Richardson's translation of the 10th Karmapa's biography His last years Sonam Rabten and Gushri Khan sitting at a teaching most likely being given by the Fifth Dalai Lama. From a mural at the Potala Palace, Lhasa, Tibet. Sonam Rapten, in general, continued to dominate the Dalai Lama and Tibetan political affairs until his death in 1658. Until G√ºshri Khan died in 1655, as a pious and devoted disciple of the Dalai Lama he made his troops and advice freely available to Sonam Rapten in their joint collaboration. This ensured the authority of the Dalai Lama was maintained over the widest unified Tibetan Kingdom established since the time of Langdarma in the 9th century. According to Richardson's reading of Dukula, however, Sonam Rapten after living a strenuous life \\"devoted himself more to religion than to politics\\" during his last few years. His prestige may have suffered, mused Richardson, from the serial failures of his attempts to invade and conquer Bhutan since these failures were ascribed to the shortcomings of his close relative and assistant Depa Norbu. His last invasion of Bhutan, 1656-57 Sonam Rabten‚Äôs last invasion of Bhutan was explained, according to Shakabpa, as follows: ‚Äú[In 1657] A Bhutanese chieftain, Chosje Namkha Rinchen, who had close contacts with Tibet, was killed, along with 20 members of his family, by his enemies. As a result, Tibetan troops were once again sent into Bhutan, and although no details are available, this campaign apparently achieved more success than earlier ones‚Äù.Shakabpa 1967, p. 118 Considering that Shakabpa states his main source for this period is Dukula,Shakabpa 2010, p. 375 where several pages full of details about the invasion are available, and where there is no indication that the campaign succeeded in any way, his above comments are puzzling. It is also stated in the most detailed accounts (Dukula and Karma Phuntsho) that the invasion was launched not as Shakabpa claims in 1657 but in mid-1656.Karmay 2014, pp. 367-381Phuntsho 2013, pp. 261-263 Dukula describes the Chosje Namkha Rinchen incident as happening at Tromo in the Chumbi valley, but as a post-war event early in 1658 rather than as a 1657 casus belli as postulated in Shakabpa.Karmay 2014, p. 381 The Fifth Dalai Lama wrote in mid-1656 that another invasion of Bhutan was ‚Äúabout to be launched‚Äù, but no justification for the attack is given.Karmay 2014, p. 367 The Bhutanese assumed that it was ‚Äúmainly an act of revenge by the Tibetan ruler Sonam [Rapten] for the disgraceful defeat he suffered in 1649‚Äù; they believed that he ‚Äúwished to put Bhutan under Tibetan Gelugpa hegemony‚Äù. They also suspected that the Tibetans feared Bhutanese prowess with occult powers which, the Bhutanese claimed, had caused the death of Gushri Khan in 1655.Phuntsho 2013, p. 247 The invasion started late in the summer of 1656. Desi Sonam Rapten and retinue went to Tsang to supervise and ‚Äòeveryone felt apprehensive‚Äô.Karmay 2014, p. 368 Depa Norbu became ‚Äòinvolved in a secret plot‚Äô which indicates he was working as a Bhutanese agent or mole, and he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the Fifth Dalai Lama to make Rabten delay or canel the attack.Karmay 2014, p. 369 Sonam Rapten‚Äôs insistence brought predictable results. After a year of guerrilla tactics by the defenders in the jungles and ravines of Bhutan, Norbu‚Äôs troops had to retreat after being bogged down, succumbing to sickness and low morale.Phuntsho 2013, pp. 247-248 Though advances were made by the other columns Norbu wasted their advantage and \\"made no effort to advance and employed cowardly delaying tactics\\" while his men wasted away through epidemics. He also fell out with his brave Mongolian generals at the end and was said to have murdered one of them by poison. The invasion failed as miserably as the first two had and Tibet suffered yet another ignominious defeat. Sonam Rapten and the Mongolian Princes who had been monitoring the invasion from the border area returned to Lhasa with survivors late in the summer of 1657 and although negotiations for a truce continued for several years, nothing came of them.Karmay 2014, pp. 374-375 Sonam Rapten, being Norbu‚Äôs elder brother, pretended not to hear about his probable heir's many failings but eventually he was compelled to react and censure him due to \\"the proliferation of negative reports about (his) deceptive behaviour\\". That winter, people started expressing concerns about Sonam Rapten growing old, so the Dalai Lama ordered extensive prayers and rituals to be done for his health and long life. Even so in early spring 1658, on the 3rd day of the 3rd Tibetan month Sonam Rapten was taken ill and died following an epileptic fit. He was 63.Karmay 2014, pp. 383-384 Funerary rituals, tributes and succession Despite their disagreements about wars and sectarianism, the Dalai Lama respected Sonam Rapten and his achievements. When Rapten died in the spring of 1658, the Dalai Lama's immediate reaction was to hush up the death for over a year for political reasons of succession.Karmay 2014, p. 384-395 At the same time, he arranged extensive offerings and rituals to be done for Rapten‚Äôs welfare as if he were still alive. When the death was announced publicly some 13 months later he ordered and oversaw many more weeks of intensive funerary rituals in his honour, making extensive offerings to over 125,000 monks to the cumulative value of no less than 14,000 tons of barley grain. These offerings, listed item by item over several pages, included, for example, over 50 kilos of gold, 44,000 bolts of different kinds of cloth, including 498 of silk and over 65,000 special ceremonial scarves.Karmay 2014, p. 395-402 In contrast to these substantial physical offerings he pays somewhat vague verbal tribute to Sonam Rapten's achievements in his Dukula without actually mentioning anything specific, saying: \\"[Sonam Rapten] took on not only many troubles for the sake of the Gelug, but also performed other extensive activities that are undeniable and known to all.\\" He then compared him to King Ralpachen, ruler of the Tibetan Empire at its zenith in the 9th century, who was \\"a man of divine manifestation\\" and who allotted seven households to each monk, adding \\"of course we cannot judge the activities of a person like him\\". By way of contrast, with regard to Sonam Rapten he remarks that \\"it is true that people can judge the meritorious work of an ordinary local ruler\\". He then puts him in proper perspective, saying \\"many Treasurers of great lamas were like the ordinary people (who) cared little about meritorious work\\"; after the death of such people \\"not much accompanied their departure\\". This was clearly not the case with Sonam Rapten.Karmay 2014, p. 399 Sonam Rapten was succeeded by his younger brother, Depa Norbu, who was appointed as the Fifth Dalai Lama's second Desi or Regent in the summer of 1659.Karmay 2014, p. 403 ReferencesSources * Office web site of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet. * Aris, Michael (1979).

Category:Regents in Tibet Category:17th-century Tibetan people Category:1595 births Category:1658 deaths ","title":"Sonam Rapten"},{"id":"24516023","text":"The Thracesian Theme (, Thrakƒìsion thema), more properly known as the Theme of the Thracesians (, thema Thrakƒìsi≈çn, often simply , Thrakƒìsioi), was a Byzantine theme (a military-civilian province) in western Asia Minor (modern Turkey). Created either in the mid-7th or the early 8th century as the settlement of the former Army of Thrace, after which it was named, it was one of the larger and more important themes of the Empire throughout its existence based on its proximity to Constantinople. The Thracesian Theme was one of the longest-lived themes, surviving until the region was conquered by the Turks in the early 14th century. History As with the other themes, the exact date of foundation is unclear. The Thracesians are first securely attested in 711, when a \\"tourmarchƒìs of the Thracesians\\" named Christopher was dispatched against Cherson by Emperor Justinian II, while a governing stratƒìgos is only attested as late as 741.... It is hence traditionally assumed that the Thracesians were initially a tourma (division) of the Anatolic Theme, and that they were raised to a full theme some time after 695, probably in the early years of the 8th century, but the phrasing of the sources does not make clear whether that had been done by 711. Some modern scholars, like Ralph-Johannes Lilie and John Haldon, however, have argued that the Thracesian army is to be identified with the Thracianus exercitus (\\"Thracian army\\") mentioned in a decree of 687, and that consequently the Thracesian theme was one of the original themes established in Asia Minor.. The name of the theme derives from the fact that the themes were formed in the mid-7th century, following the Muslim conquests, as military encampment areas for the remnants of the old field armies of the East Roman army; in the case of the Thracesians, the field army of the magister militum per Thracias... This is further supported by the fact that units that are known to have been part of the latter in the 4th/5th centuries, the vexillatio palatina of the Equites Theodosiaci Iuniores and the auxilium palatinum of the Victores, are attested again as the thematic tourmai of the Theodosiakoi and Viktores in the 10th century. This provides the Thracesian theme with the distinction of fielding some of the oldest known units of the Byzantine army... This origin is reflected in the mythical story narrated by Emperor Constantine VII (reigned 913‚Äì959) in his De Thematibus, whereby the region was named after some Thracians settled there in the early 6th century BC by Alyattes of Lydia.; . The first known stratƒìgos of the Thracesians, a certain Sisinnios, supported Constantine V (r. 740‚Äì775) against the usurper Artabasdos (r. 741‚Äì742), but was himself later blinded by the emperor when he suspected him of conspiracy. Constantine took care to appoint a series of governors loyal to him and his policies; the most prominent among them being the ardent iconoclast Michael Lachanodrakon. Lachanodrakon launched a brutal persecution of iconophiles, especially the monks, so that by 772, in the words of historian Warren Treadgold, he seems to have succeeded in \\"eradicating monasticism within his theme\\"... Other notable governors of the theme include Bardanes Tourkos, who was its stratƒìgos in the 790s and rebelled against Nikephoros I (r. 803‚Äì811) in 803; Constantine Kontomytes, who defeated the Cretan Saracens at Mount Latros in 841 and married into the imperial family;. Petronas, the uncle of Michael III (r. 842‚Äì867) and the Empire's leading general, in 856‚Äì863;. and Symbatios the Armenian, who along with the governor of the Opsician Theme George Peganes tried to oppose the growing power of Basil the Macedonian, Michael III's prot√©g√© who eventually usurped the throne from him. In the 10th century, as the threat of Arab raids subsided, the soldiers of the Thracesians appear to have been used more and more in overseas expeditions, such as the expeditions sent against the Emirate of Crete in 911, 949 and 960.. The same process saw the theme gradually becoming a peaceful backwater; by 1029, the appointment of one of the Empire's most capable generals, Constantine Diogenes, who was suspected of harbouring designs on the throne, to the position of its stratƒìgos was seen as a demotion, and as a measure to curb his power.. The theme was briefly conquered by the Seljuk Turks in the late 1070s, but most of its territory was recovered by John Doukas with the help of the First Crusade in the late 1090s. John II Komnenos (r. 1118‚Äì1143) re-established the theme as an administrative unit, albeit with a reduced size, under a doux with seat at Philadelphia. The southern portion of the old theme became part of the new theme of Mylasa and Melanoudion.. It was reconstituted under the Nicaean Empire, and by this time consisted of the katepanikia of Smyrna and Anaia along the Aegean coast, and the chora of Pyrgion and Kaloe in the upper Kaystros valley. Basil Chrysomalles is the first known governor after 1204, and the list of governors from 1233 until 1260 is almost complete. The theme of Maeander, with its seat at Antioch-on-the-Maeander, was subordinated to it. The Thracesian Theme was one of the last Byzantine territories in Asia Minor to fall to the various Turkish beyliks, and played an important role as a bulwark against their raids. By the early 14th century, however, it had been restricted to the area around Smyrna, until that city also fell to the Beylik of Aydƒ±n in 1330. Geography and administration The theme of the Thracesians comprised the ancient regions of Ionia (the late Roman province Asia), Lydia, the northern half of Caria, and part of Phrygia Pacatiana. The theme was bordered on the west by the Aegean Sea, with its coastline stretching from Ephesus to Adramyttion, the Opsician Theme in the north, probably along the valley of the river Caicus), the Anatolic Theme in the east (somewhere east of Chonae and Laodicea on the Lycus), and the Cibyrrhaeot Theme in the south. The theme contained some 20 cities, although most of them were much reduced from their late antique status. Smyrna and Ephesus (known as \\"Theologos\\" at the time) were probably the largest among them. The Persian geographer Ibn Khordadbeh, who wrote c. 847, mentions Ephesus as the capital, but this is not certain; it may instead have been at Chonae.; . The theme's governing stratƒìgos ranked in the first tier of thematic governors and received an annual salary of 40 pounds of gold. The Arab geographer Qudama ibn Ja'far, who wrote c. 930, gives the troops under his command as 6,000, while Ibn al-Faqih, who wrote a generation earlier, puts them as high as 10,000..

Life and times Otto Peter Friedrich Bemberg was born in Cologne, Germany, in 1827. He emigrated to Argentina in 1850 and married Mar√≠a Luisa Ocampo, the daughter of prominent local landowners and developers. He established an import-export firm specializing in the import of textile products and the export of local cereals for the European market. In 1860 he was appointed Consul General in Paris, where the couple remained until 1867. On the eve of his departure, Bemberg established his first manufacturing firm, the Franco Argentina Brewery; his father, Pedro Bemberg Boull√©, had been partly of French descent. In Paris, he also established the Brasserie Argentine Societ√© Anonyme (\\"Argentine Brewing, Inc.\\") and later had his son, Otto Sebasti√°n, enrol at the Technical University of Munich, where he became a trained brewer.Lewis, Paul. The Crisis of Argentine Capitalism. University of North Carolina Pres, 1990. The Quilmes Brewery, around the time of its 1890 inaugural. Bemberg obtained commissions from Presidents Bartolom√© Mitre and Nicol√°s Avellaneda for the establishment of agricultural colonies in the then-practically undeveloped Santa Fe Province, the site of some of the country's most productive cropland. Retaining financial interests in Paris, he and his son established the Brasserie Argentine Quilmes (Quilmes Brewery) in 1888, and inaugurated its brewing and bottling plant in the company's namesake, the southern Buenos Aires suburb of Quilmes, in 1890. The facility was the largest and most advanced in Argentina, and soon eclipsed its main competitor, the Bieckert Brewery. Bemberg died in Paris in 1896 and his son, Otto Sebasti√°n, led the company to a dominant position in its local market; his younger son, Herman Bemberg, remained in Paris and became a noted French composer. Otto Sebasti√°n's son, Otto Eduardo (1887‚Äì1984), went on to take the Bemberg dynasty to its zenith in the mid-20th century. In August 1929, aged 42, he reportedly had a premonition about the Wall Street Crash in his sleep, which he quickly acted upon. He sold all his shares and bought 400 tons of gold just in time, a move which undoubtedly saved his family from financial ruin. Nonetheless, when he broke the good news to his father, Otto Sebasti√°n simply replied \\"I knew you would\\". By the 1960s, noticing the diminished drive in his subsequent generations who had been born into unprecedented wealth, he said to one of his grandchildren \\"it is easier to make a fortune than it is to maintain it\\". One of Bemberg's five children, Mar√≠a Luisa Bemberg, went on to become a successful film director in Argentina from 1980 until her death in 1995. Her son, Carlos Miguens Bemberg was the last member of the Bemberg family to sell their stake in the Quilmes Brewery in 2006, 118 years after its foundation.

The route is one of the few discontinuous state highways in New Jersey, split by wetlands, the Garden State Parkway and the Mullica River. Although the alignment is registered by the New Jersey Department of Transportation as highway, the amount of roadway is considerably shorter. The route begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 9 (US 9) in Port Republic, where it continues along Old New York Road to an end of roadway at the Parkway embankment. Across the Mullica River, Route 167 continues at a gate for wetlands, heading northward to an intersection with US 9 in Bass River Township. The route originated as part of New Jersey Route 4 during construction of a new state highway in 1917. Route 4 was built northward to the current Route 167 northern terminus in 1926, which was designated as part of US 9 that year. The highway was long and included an iron truss bridge. The route remained intact until construction of the Garden State Parkway and a new bridge over the Mullica River in the early 1950s. When the bridge was finished, US 9 was realigned off the roadway and the prior alignment became Route 167 during the New Jersey state highway renumbering. The route was split twice since 1953, first by the removal of the old Mullica River bridge in 1962 as part of a sale to the National Park Service for a refuge in Virginia, then the northern portion was dismantled except for a alignment for a wetland mitigation project. Today, the route remains split and the road is still maintained by the state. Route description Route 167 northbound near the few signage designating the highway, a milepost marker in Port Republic Route 167's southern terminus is located at an intersection with US 9 (New York Road) in the city of Port Republic. The route then intersects with the original alignment of New York Road, now known today as Old New York Road. Route 167 crosses over a stream, intersecting a privately maintained roadway soon after. The route approaches the Garden State Parkway, but ends at a gate and embankment nearby. After a gap in the roadway, which consists of a former bridge over the Mullica River dismantled and moved to Virginia, bridges removed for wetlands mitigation in the marshes just north, and the orphaned roads in between (which are visible from the Garden State Parkway to the west), Route 167 resurfaces in Bass River Township as a short dead-end street only approximately long, serving only a few homes. The route intersects Bogan Lane and comes to an end at an intersection with US 9. The route's official speed limit, which is not signed, is 25 mph (30 km/h) at its southern segment and 50 mph (70 km/h) in its northern segment. However the Straight Line Diagrams produced by the Department of Transportation list both segments as 50 mph (70 km/h). History Route 167 originates as a part of New Jersey Route 4 from Absecon to Rahway, designated in the 1920s. The route remained intact for several years, receiving the co-designation of US 9 in 1926, when the nationwide system was assigned. In 1927, the New Jersey State Highway Department had a statewide state highway renumbering, extending Route 4 in both directions. The two routes remained intact until Route 4 was truncated to Bergen County during the 1953 state highway renumbering.) The roadway itself remained until construction of the Garden State Parkway's tenth section from New Jersey Route 43 in Absecon to Dover Road in 1954. In August of that year, a bridge over the Mullica River for the Parkway, onto which US 9 was realigned, was completed, replacing the alignment over the old structure. During construction, Route 4 and US 9 were realigned onto a temporary alignment to the older structure, while the old one remained unnumbered. Route 167 approaching the embankment of the Garden State Parkway in Port Republic Upon the realignment of US 9, the State Highway Department renumbered the former alignment as Route 167. The route, originally wide, was shortened during the construction of the new alignments, which also involved taking homes and properties from the highway. The former portion became a gravel road upon completion in Port Republic. Route 167 now continued along the former alignment, using the iron truss bridge built in 1917 for Route 4 to the intersection with U.S. Route 9 in Bass River Township. The old iron truss bridge lasted several years after the realignment, lasting past 1960. The truss bridge was dismantled in 1962, and sold to the state of Virginia and the National Park Service for the National Wildlife Refuge. The route remained intact for a couple decades, with a gap in the highway. The State Highway Department registered the alignment of Route 167 in 1969 as long, although there was a gap in the roadway. The route's northern half from the Mullica River, constructed in 1926 as part of Route 4, was dismantled in 1984 for Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge. As of 2007, Route 167 is unsigned, running from US 9 in Port Republic to the bank of the Garden State Parkway at the Mullica River Bridge on its south side and from US 9 to a gate on the north side. The straight line diagrams also mention the length of the roadway being long, although only is still accessible roadway.

The route provides an alternate alignment of U.S. Route 9 through South Toms River and Toms River. The southern terminus is at an intersection with U.S. Route 9 northbound in Beachwood, where it heads northward along Atlantic City Boulevard. The route continues until ending where U.S. Route 9 leaves the Parkway north of Toms River. US 9 itself uses the Garden State Parkway to bypass Toms River. Route 166 is a former alignment of New Jersey Route 4, designated in 1920 and U.S. Route 9, designated in 1927 through Toms River. The highways were realigned when the Garden State Parkway was built, and the original alignment became U.S. Route 9 Alternate in the 1950s, which was eventually replaced with Route 166. The alignment has remained the same since. Route description View north along Route 166 at Washington Street in downtown Toms River Route 166 begins at an interchange with U.S. Route 9 northbound (Atlantic City Boulevard) in the community of South Toms River. The route heads northward along the right-of-way of Atlantic City Boulevard, progressing northward along residential homes. Paralleling to the north of U.S. Route 9, Route 166 continues, passing a war memorial in the southern portion of the business district. In the center of the community, the highway intersects with Ocean County Route 621 (Admiral Avenue). There, Route 166 turns to the northeast, running along the shoreline of the Toms River. Heading past a marina, the highway crosses on a four-lane bridge over the river and into the Township of Toms River. After landing down on the Toms River side, Route 166 heads to the northwest, intersecting with the incomplete Herficker Boulevard. The highway turns off its right-of-way, and crosses another branch into the center of Toms River. Passing the Riverfront Landing, Route 166 intersects with the eastern/southern terminus of County Route 527 (Water Street). The highway continues northward along commercial buildings as Main Street, passing to the west of Toms River High School and back into the residential districts. Route 166 continues northbound to an interchange with New Jersey Route 37 (Little League World Champions Boulevard) in Toms River. At the interchange, Route 166 switches names from Main Street to Lakewood Road, which heads northwestward. Route 166, after changing monikers, continues northwestward through the commercial and industrial portions of Toms River, intersecting with several local and county roads until a fork with Ocean County Route 623, where the highway forks at Riverside Cemetery. A short distance later, the highway begins a split parallel with the Garden State Parkway and U.S. Route 9 to the east. Route 166 then leaves the commercial and industrial districts for the residential ones soon later, crossing through several developments including Colonial Gardens. The highway continues northward, intersecting with Albert Avenue, where it returns to the commercial area. After an intersection with Briar Knoll, Route 166 divides, approaching Interchange 83 on the Garden State Parkway, where the designation terminates. The right-of-way continues northward as U.S. Route 9. History The alignment of Route 166 was originally part of Route 4 prior to 1927, designated from Absecon to Rahway. This designation remained in place for seven years, until the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, which remained part of an extended Route 4. A year prior to the state highway renumbering, the alignment of Route 4 was also co-designated as part of U.S. Route 9, which had been assigned as part of a nationwide system. Route 4 remained intact concurrent with Route 9 until the state highway renumbering on January 1, 1953. On that day, Route 4 was truncated back to Fort Lee in Bergen County, and the alignment became only U.S. Route 9. A bypass was built of the Route 9 alignment in the 1950s along with construction of the Garden State Parkway, which was completed soon after. The route currently Route 166 became U.S. Route 9 Alternate by 1954, remaining for several years, when it was decommissioned in place for Route 166. The route has remained intact since.

The southern terminus is at Kennedy Boulevard and County Route 501 in the community of North North Bergen. The route crosses the county line and heads along the boulevard through the communities of Ridgefield, Palisades Park, and Fort Lee before reaching its northern terminus at an interchange with U.S. Route 1-9 and 46 in Fort Lee. Route 63 originated in 1927 as the alignment of Route S1, which ran along the current alignment as a spur of New Jersey Route 1. The designated route's southern terminus was at Hudson County West Boulevard (now Kennedy Boulevard), northward to State Highway Route 1, State Highway Route 6 and U.S. Routes 1-9 and 46. The route had one suffixed spur, State Highway Route S-1-A, (now an alignment of New Jersey Route 67) until the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering on January 1 of that year. That day, Route S-1 was decommissioned and replaced by Route 63. Route description View north along Route 63 between Morningside Avenue and Park Avenue in Fairview.

The route progresses northward, concurrent with County Route 501, from the intersection along Bergen Boulevard, passing through a large residential and commercial community, passing to the east of the Fairview Cemetery, located in Fairview. After crossing into Bergen County, Routes 63 and 501 continue further, passing over County Route 48 (Fairview Avenue) on an overpass. Bergen Boulevard passes through the partial- residential/commercial community for a distance, becoming a divided highway until an intersection with Cliff Street. At Cliff Street, the right-of-ways come back together, and the highway itself passes the Mount Moriah Cemetery near a large high-rise. Routes 63 and 501 continues northward, passing a small set of tankers near the cemetery. There, the route returns to the commercial- residential split it once was, continuing through Ridgefield and into Fort Lee.

County Route 501 continues towards Route 93. History During the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering by the New Jersey State Highway Department, the alignment of current-day Route 63 was designated as State Highway Route S-1, a spur off of New Jersey Route 1. The route began at the Hudson County West Boulevard (now Kennedy Boulevard), heading northbound to Ridgefield, where it would meet Route 1, Route 6, U.S. Route 1, U.S. Route 9 and U.S. Route 46. Both intersections are now the termini to Route 63. Two years later, a remade legislation was performed in the New Jersey State Legislature, redefining the alignment for State Highway Route S-1, with the southern terminus changing to Hudson County Boulevard, a rename to the original southern terminus. Also, the northern terminus was then defined as being in Fort Lee. State Highway Route S-1 remained intact for the next two decades, and along with a suffixed spur, State Highway Route S-1-A, the two routes were thoroughfares through the southern Palisades. On January 1, 1953, the New Jersey State Highway Department went ahead with a second state highway renumbering. Route S-1 and its suffixed spur, Route S-1-A, were decommissioned in favor of new designations. State Highway Route S-1 became Route 63 while its suffixed spur became Route 67.

It supports general aviation with no commercial airline service scheduled. History Niergnies Airport was a pre-World War II civil airport, consisting of a terminal, hangar, some support buildings and a grass airfield, serving the nearby city of Cambrai. German use during World War II It was seized by the Germans in late May 1940 during the early part of the Battle of France. It was briefly used as a fighter airfield by Jagdgeschwader 3 (JG 3) in late May, participating in the Blitzkrieg against the French Army and British Expeditionary Force flying Messerschmitt Bf 109Es. The Luftwaffe, 1933-45 After the battle, the airfield was not used by the Luftwaffe for several years. In 1943, the Germans laid down two 1600m all-weather concrete runways at the airport, aligned 15/33 and 09/27. Large numbers of aircraft dispersal pads, maintenance shops, hangars and other support facilities were also built. Presumably, this was due to the fortification of the Pas-de-Calais, being believed by the Germans that when the Americans and British tried to land in France to open a Second Front, the airfield would have a key role in the defense of France. This construction drew the attention of the USAAF Ninth Air Force, which attacked the airfield on 1st and 2d December 1943 with B-26 Marauder medium bombers (322d, 387th Bombardment Groups), severely damaging the facility. The airfield was not used again by the Germans.USAFHRA Document Search \\"Niergnies\\" American use American Ninth Army units moved through the area in early September 1944, heading towards Cambrai. On 10 September The IX Engineer Command 862d Engineer Aviation Battalion moved in and began a quick rehabilitation of the base so it could be used by American aircraft. The engineers filled bomb craters and laid Pierced Steel Planking over the damaged areas of the 15/33 runway, and patched the 08/26 runway with asphalt and tarmac. In addition to the airfield, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting. It was declared operationally ready for Ninth Air Force combat units on 12 September, only a few days after its capture from German forces, being designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"A-74 Cambrai/Niergnies Airfield\\"IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields, Airfield Layout It hosted the following known Ninth Air Force units:Maurer, Maurer.

Postwar/NATO use In French control after the war, the base sat abandoned for several years. There was much unexploded ordnance at the site which needed to be removed, as well as the wreckage of German and American aircraft. Many of the buildings at the base were destroyed by the war, and although some had been repaired by the American combat engineers, most were in ruins. The French Air Force had no interest in the airfield and there was no money available to restore the commercial airport that existed before the war. As a result, the Air Ministry leased the land, concrete runways, structures and all, out to farmers for agricultural use, sending in unexploded ordnance teams to remove the dangerous munitions. In 1950 when as a result of the Cold War threat of the Soviet Union, the air base at Cambrai-Niergnies was offered to the United States Air Force by the French Air Ministry as part of their NATO commitment to establish a modern Air Force Base at the site. NATO faced several problems when attempting to solve the air power survival equation. Planning for a Warsaw Pact first strike survival in both conventional and nuclear wars had to be considered. The main air bases were built on small parcels of land with very limited dispersal space. It was decided to use Cambrai-Niergnies as an emergency \\"backup\\" airfield, consisting of a \\"bare bones\\" facility of a runway with minimal facilities intended for use by all NATO air forces to disperse their aircraft in case of war. Beginning about 1953, French demolition companies returned to Laon-Athies and began demolishing the German structures and removing the wreckage of the World War II air base. French Army Explosive demolition teams were brought in to safely remove unexploded ordnance remaining from the war and the site was prepared for construction. A modern all-weather concrete NATO jet runway was laid down aligned 17/35 over one of the former German runways, with alert pads for two fighter squadrons on each end of the runway. The extensive Luftwaffe dispersal pads and taxiways were also refurbished and integrated into the new base. Along the new NW/SE taxiway a circular marguerite system of hardstands which could be revetted later with earth for added aircraft protection was built. In addition, the wartime 08/26 runway had the wartime repairs removed and was totally refurbished, giving the airfield two operational runways. When completed, the base could accommodate about three or four squadrons of aircraft, 50 total. However, other than the occasional touch-and-go landing of NATO (USAF) aircraft, Cambrai-Niergnies Air Base was never used. With the French withdrawal from the integrated military component of NATO in 1967, the base was abandoned.McAuliffe, Jerome J (2005): U.S. Air Force in France 1950-1967, Chapter 17, Dispersed Operating Bases Civil use With the NATO facility closed, the facility was turned over by the French Air Ministry to the local government. A small part of the large NATO air base has been converted into a civil airport, with about 3000' of the 5000' 08/26 secondary runway being maintained as the airport's runway. Parallel to the runway, a short grass runway has been built for glider use. An asphalt taxiway connects the runway to a small parking/ramp area used by light aircraft, with what appears to be NATO-era buildings being used as support buildings for the airport and several hangars. The expensive NATO airfield still exists, complete with runways, taxiways, and dispersals, deteriorating after 40 years of abandonment. Expansion joints in the concrete are starting to separate the various concrete pads, and a few of the dispersals have large amounts of vegetation growing on them, presumably through the cracks in the concrete. From the air, the airfield appears frozen in time, a complete, well-equipped Cold War air base that was never used.

Wadley (December 16, 1906 ‚Äì September 23, 2009) was an American co- founder of the Five Civilized Tribes Museum in Muskogee, Oklahoma. Wadley became the museum's first president after its opening. Early life Marie Wadley was born in Pensacola, Indian Territory, on December 16, 1906, less than a year before the territory became the U.S. state of Oklahoma in 1907. Wadley was of both Cherokee and Shawnee descent. She was raised on a farm near Vinita, Oklahoma. In 1923, Wadley moved to Muskogee to enroll at Draughon Business College. Career Wadley took the civil service exam and in 1925 she was hired for her first, and \\"only\\" job as a staff member with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). She was initially hired as a clerk stenographer. Years later, Wadley, who championed Native American causes throughout her life, spoke of her experience with the BIA, Wadley, as an employee of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), worked to get a bill introduced into the U.S. Congress in the 1950s aimed at establishing a Native American museum in the Union Agency building in Muskogee, Oklahoma. The Union Agency building had been constructed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1875. In 1951, Wadley began working with then U.S. Representative David Boren (D-Oklahoma) to transfer ownership of the Union Agency building, as well as five acres of land surrounding the site, from the federal government to the city of Muskogee with the purpose of establishing the museum. U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower signed the bill into law in 1953, returning the Union Agency and the five acres back to local control. Wadley worked with local political and community figures to plan new museum over the next thirteen years. She wanted a historically accurate museum which would correctly depict and display the local Native American culture of eastern Oklahoma. Museum The Five Civilized Tribes Museum, which showcases the history, culture and art of the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek and Seminole Native American tribes, officially opened on April 16, 1966. Wadley became the first president of the new museum's board of directors. Later life Wadley retired from the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1967, after a 42-year career with the agency. She was a tribal relations officer at the time of her retirement. Marie Wadley died at her home in Muskogee, Oklahoma, on September 23, 2009, at the age of 102. Her funeral was held at the St. Paul Methodist Church in Muskogee.

Schanzer, National Review. August 15, 2007 Overview The Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice was mentioned in a 2007 report on Al-Arabiya. They were described as an \\"unknown\\" group that have released a statement declaring a campaign to hunt down all, \\"slaves of the devil who commit blasphemy and roam the streets\\". Their statement called upon youth to resist temptation from the devil as, \\"the devil's path leads to perdition [...] Young people are our main target since they commit many transgressions whether name calling that involves God or through hanging out late at night in the streets, smoking and disturbing people.\\" The group also claimed responsibility for severely beating up two members of a Khan Younis clan, \\"for committing sins such as disrespect for God and disturbing people [...] That was a warning for them. Hopefully, they will come to their senses.\\"Gaza gets its own 'religious police', Al-Arabiya 08-10-2007 Citing a report in Al-Quds Al-Arabi, Al-Arabiya said one of the first acts of the group was to beat up a singer in Gaza after he gave a concert in Khan Younis. Al-Arabiya noted that \\"There was no official comment from Hamas leaders on the acts or declarations of Gaza's self-styled religious police.\\" Detention of Asma al-Ghul In 2009, The Jerusalem Post reported that the Committee is a police force that operates under the command of the Hamas Ministry of the Waqf (Islamic Endowment), and includes dozens of plainclothes police officers who patrol public places such as beaches, parks, restaurants, hair salons and cafes to ensure that males and females are not mixing together and that the women are dressed modestly. A special all-female unit within the force is said to number 100-150 officers who enforce female modesty and handle female suspects, with uniforms that include a niqab and gloves, \\"with only an eye slit visible\\". Citing unnamed local Gaza reporters, the newspaper states that the Hamas de facto government has not publicly acknowledged the force's existence because it fears being branded fundamentalist. Another incident attributed to the group by The Jerusalem Post concerns Asma al-Ghul, a female Palestinian journalist, who stated that policemen from the force: > attempted to arrest her under the pretext that she came to a Gaza beach > dressed immodestly and was seen laughing in public...\\"They accused me of > laughing loudly while swimming with my friend and failing to wear a hijab,\\" > Ghul told a human rights organization in the Gaza Strip. \\"They also wanted > to know the identity of the people who were with me at the beach and whether > they were relatives of mine.\\" Al-Ghul added that the officers confiscated her passport, and that she had received death threats from anonymous callers following the incident. Regarding the incident, \\"Hamas security commanders initially said that [al- Ghul] and her friends were stopped because they were having a mixed party at the beach. Later, one of the commanders said that al-Ghul was stopped [for] not wearing a hijab while swimming. Another commander claimed\\" that the offense was \\"smoking nargilas and partying in a public place\\". The Guardian reported the same incident also citing al-Ghul, but attributing it only to \\"Hamas police\\".

Penney, and Ross Dress for Less as its anchor stores. Other major tenants of the mall include H&M;, Five Below, and Shoe Dept. Encore. History Kentucky Oaks Mall first opened in 1982 on U.S. Route 60 (Hinkleville Road) just west of Interstate 24. At the time, it had JCPenney, Sears, Ben Snyder's (later Hess's, now Dillard's), and Meis (which became Elder-Beerman in 1989) as its anchors. Venture added its first Kentucky location to the mall in 1989. The Venture store closed in 1998 and became Shopko in May 1999. In 2000, it was rumored that the mall would be sold to CBL & Associates Properties. Shopko remained in the mall for only two years, closing in 2001 along with several other stores, most of which were former Venture stores as well. Several other big-box stores were added on the mall's periphery in the early 2000s, including a Walmart Supercenter and a prototype store for The Home Depot. By 2003, K's Merchandise Mart had opened in the space vacated by Shopko. Best Buy and Old Navy were both added in mid-2004, with the former supplanting a former Ruby Tuesday restaurant. K's Merchandise closed on November 7, 2006 with the chain's bankruptcy. The K's items were then liquidated by HPG Enterprises, which was closed only one month later after a judge forced it to close due to deceptive advertising. Despite the loss of this anchor store, the mall continued to gain tenants in 2006, including Hollister Co. and New York & Company. In November 2010, Dick's Sporting Goods opened in the space formerly occupied by K's Merchandise.

As a player, he holds the distinction of being the first professional player to win the Chinese league championship at two different clubs, his first as a key member of the Shandong Luneng's 1999 championship voyage and then as a member of Shenzhen Jianlibao's championship squad in 2004. After retiring he would have a short stint as an assistant coach for Shanghai Stars and he moved away from football until October 17, 2010 saw him detained by the police for his involvement in fixing a league game during his time at Shanghai International in a match against Tianjin Teda F.C. on November 30, 2003 and was sentenced to five and a half years imprisonment on June 13, 2012. Club career Li Ming started his football career with top tier side Shandong Luneng in the 1994 Chinese Jia-A League campaign, which was the inaugural season of fully professional football within China. With Shandong he had established himself as a key member of the team and by the 1999 league season he had won the league title and Chinese FA Cup with them. By the 2001 league season Li Ming had lost his starting position within the team where he was limited to only five games and after a disappointing campaign he was allowed to leave the club. At the beginning of the 2002 league season he would transfer to another top tier side in Beijing Guoan where he would immediately establish himself as a vital member of the team and helped the club to a third-place finish. After only one season with Beijing Guoan, Li Ming decided to transfer to Shanghai International in 2003 and once again he immediately established himself as a vital member of the team that narrowly lost the 2003 league season and came runners-up by a single point. His time with Shanghai International, however did not last very long after rumours circulated that the team threw the league and Li Ming joined Shenzhen Jianlibao to take part in the rebranded 2004 Chinese Super League. At his new club he formed a solid defense with Li Weifeng and Xin Feng, which saw the team win the championship. After his successful time with Shenzhen and nearing the end of his career, Li Ming transferred to second tier club Shanghai Stars in 2006 with the invitation from his old pal at Shanghai International, Shen Si where he played as a player and assistant coach for one year. International career Li Ming was called up to the Chinese U-23 team and was part of the team that was knocked-out in the qualifiers for the Football at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Despite this he was called up to the senior team by Qi Wusheng who tried him out within the 1995 Dynasty Cup where Li Ming made his debut on February 19, 1995 against South Korea in a 0-0 draw. His time for the national team was sporadic until Bora Milutinovic became manager and after Li Ming's successful title win he was called back into the team in 2000 for several further friendlies, however he could not do enough to remain a permanent member. Match-fixing On October 17, 2010, Li Ming was reported to have been detained by the police and was said to be involved in fixing the November 30, 2003 league game against Tianjin Teda F.C. during his stint as a player at Shanghai International. The allegations suggests that his teammate Shen Si was bribed by former Tianjin Teda general manager Yang Yifeng a total of 12 million Yuan to lose the game and that Shen had asked teammates Li Ming, Jiang Jin and Qi Hong and to help him. After being arrested by the police a lengthy wait eventually saw Li Ming found guilty of match-fixing and was sentenced to five and a half years imprisonment on June 13, 2012 and fined 500,000 Yuan along with his associates except for Shen Si who was given six years.

It base-pairs to thymine rather than cytosine, causing a G:C to A:T transition in DNA.  Formation  6-O-Methylguanine is formed in DNA by alkylation of the oxygen atom of guanine, most often by N-nitroso compounds (NOC) and sometimes due to methylation by other compounds such as endogenous S-adenosyl methionine. NOC are alkylating agents formed by the reaction of nitrite or other nitrogen oxides with secondary amines and N-alkylamides, yielding N-alkylnitrosamines and N-alkylnitrosamides. NOC are found in some foods (bacon, sausages, cheese) and tobacco smoke, and are formed in the gastrointestinal tract, especially after consumption of red meat. In addition, endogenous nitric oxide levels were found to be enhanced under chronic inflammatory conditions, and this could favor NOC formation in the large intestine.  Repair and carcinogenicity  Repair of 6-O-methylguanine in DNA is primarily carried out by O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Epigenetic reductions in MGMT expression are one of the most frequent DNA repair defects, associated with carcinogenesis. (Also see MGMT expression in cancer.)  Mutagenicity  In 1985 Yarosh summarized the early work that established 6-O-methylguanine as the alkylated base in DNA that was the most mutagenic and carcinogenic. In 1994 Rasouli-Nia et al. showed that about one mutation was induced for every eight unrepaired 6-O-Methylguanines in DNA. About one third of the time 6-O-methylguanine mispairs during replication, leading to the incorporation of dTMP rather than dCMP. 6-O-methylguanine is therefore a mutagenic nucleobase. However, the mutagenicity of a particular 6-O-methylguanine base depends on the sequence in which it is embedded.  Other effects  Unrepaired 6-O-methylguanine can also lead to cell cycle arrest, sister chromatid exchange, or apoptosis. These effects are due to interaction of the DNA mismatch repair pathway with 6-O-methylguanine, and also depend on signaling network activation, led by early ATM, H2AX, CHK1 and p53 phosphorylation.

(2003). Practical Cryptography, p. 109, Indianapolis, Indiana: Wiley Publishing, Inc. or \\"mean what you sign and sign what you mean\\" not merely the encrypted version of what was meant. The principle is named after the title character in the Dr. Seuss children's book Horton Hatches the Egg.Wagner, David; Schneier, Bruce (April 15, 1997). \\"Analysis of the SSL 3.0 Protocol\\". schneier.com. The Horton Principle becomes important when using Message Authentication Codes (or MACs) in a cryptographic system. Suppose Alice wants to send a message to Bob, and she uses a MAC to authenticate a message m that was made by concatenating three data fields, where m := a  b  c. Bob needs to know what rules Alice used to create the message in order to split m back into its components, but if he uses the wrong rules then he'll get the wrong values from an authenticated message. When applied in this case, the Horton Principle works by authenticating the meaning instead of the message. For instance, MAC clears not only the communication but also the information that Bob used in parsing such message into its meaning. The meaning, however, also depends on the decryption key used and that the authentication must be applied to the plaintext instead of the ciphertext. The problem is that the MAC is only authenticating a string of bytes, while Alice and Bob need to authenticate the way the message was constructed as well. If not, then it may be possible for an attacker to substitute a message with a valid MAC but a different meaning. Systems can manage this problem by adding metadata such as a protocol number or by formatting messages with an explicit structure, such as XML.

It currently houses Trinity Church York and the Quilt Museum and Gallery. The Hall, located on Peasholme Green, was built between 1446 and 1453 on the site of a chapel of St Anthony for either the Guild of St Martin or the Guild of St Anthony (which was founded in 1446). After the decline of the Guilds, it was used between 1627 and 1705 for various purposes: as an arsenal, a military hospital and a prison. Between 1705 and 1947 it housed the York Bluecoat School, after which it was offered to the York Civic Trust. In 1953, it became the Borthwick Institute for Historical Research (now the Borthwick Institute for Archives), which moved in 2004 to a purpose-built building next to the J B Morrell Library on the campus of the University of York. The Quilt Museum and Gallery opened in the Hall in 2008 and closed in 2015.  Architecture  Roof of the main hall The Hall resembles the Merchant Adventurers' Hall in that it has two floors, of which the lower one consisted of a hospital and a chapel. In contrast to the Merchants' Hall, however, the walls of the lower floor are of stone (rather than brick) and the outer walls of the timber-framed upper floor were rebuilt in brick in the 17th century. History St Anthony's Hall was built between 1446 and 1453 but there are several different accounts of who was responsible for founding it. The first date, 1446, is connected to a charter granted to a group of wealthy citizens of York, by Henry VI that licensed them to found a Guild of St Mary and St Martin. Most sources agree that the Hall was built by this Guild of St Martin, with no mention of a Guild of St Anthony being associated with the Hall at the time of its construction, and that the name of St Anthony was used for the Hall because of a chapel that had formally occupied the site. However, there is evidence for a Fraternity of St Anthony of York in the city as early 1438, so it is possible that this group and the Guild of St Martin built and shared a guildhall. It has also been argued that they were both the same guild and the men who obtained the charter were members of the St Anthony group who were unable to use their preferred name on the charter because there was already a Guild of St Anthony in London. The 1453 date relates to the year of the consecration of the chapel although the building itself was not completed until several years later. The Hall was used as the venue for great feasts that took place every three years. These were repeatedly associated with claims of mismanagement by the guild that would eventually lead to its downfall. Maintenance of the Hall was funded by contributions by trade and craft guilds but in the 1560s monetary concerns led to the Hall becoming used as a workhouse for the poor until the passing of the 1601 Poor Relief Act. Other uses for the Hall in the late sixteenth century included being an archery practice range and as a theatre for the performance of Mystery plays. The Guild failed to control its financial problems and was dissolved in 1627. During the reign of Charles I the Hall was used as a military storehouse and served as a hospital following the Battle of Marston Moor. In 1655 it was remodelled for use as a prison with additional internal walls and exterior brickwork being added to the building. Between 1705 and 1946 the Hall also became home to the Blue Coat School, initially a charity school for forty boys which was based on the first floor, until the prison was relocated by the 1820s and the school occupied the whole building. This was not the first time the Hall was a centre for education, in 1579 the chapel had been used to teach children French. After the Bluecoat School closed the Hall was left vacant until restoration work in 1951-52 was completed and the Borthwick Institute opened in May 1953. Again the building was multi-purpose as it was also used as York's Day Continuation School and when this moved out in the late 1960s it was replaced by the York Archaeological Trust for over 20 years. Due to the limitations of the building the Borthwick Institute eventually moved to a new location in 2004 and the building was sold to the York Conservtion Trust in 2006 who undertook works to preserve the building. The project cost ¬£2.2 million and included creation of a sensory garden and underpinning the walls. It was officially reopened by the Archbishop of York, John Sentamu, in 2010. In June 2008 the Quilt Museum and Gallery opened at the Hall displaying a collection of antique and modern quilts. The museum closed in October 2015 but the collection can still be seen by appointment. The Hall is currently the home of Trinity Church York.

Biography Born in Monza, Galbiati was a lieutenant in the Royal Italian Army's elite Arditi during the First World War. He was wounded in action in 1917.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, p. 144 Whilst still in the army (he was demobilised in 1920) he joined the Monza fascio in 1919 and became the leader of the squadristi. Involved in the March on Rome, Galbiati gained a reputation for his brutality as a squad leader and in 1924 he charged with, although later acquitted of, murder. As a consul of the Blackshirts, Galbiati was involved in the 'revolt of the consuls' when on 31 December 1924 thirty leading fascists entered the offices of Benito Mussolini in an attempt to force him to overcome the political impasse that followed the Matteoti Crisis.Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism, 1914-1945, 1995, pp. 114-5 From 1925 to the following year Galbiati was out of the fascist movement after Mussolini expelled him for his involvement in the 'revolt'. However he was soon readmitted and once again became a leading figure in the Blackshirts, suffering further war wounds in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. Returning to Italy he was appointed inspector of university militias and had risen to the rank of Luogotenente Generale in the Blackshirts by the time Italy entered the Second World War. He saw service in the Italian invasion of Albania before in May 1941 succeeding Achille Starace as Blackshirt Chief of Staff. By 1943 he was the national commander of the Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale (MVSN), as the Blackshirts were formally known.Philip Morgan, The Fall of Mussolini, Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 16 The role in the fall of Mussolini Despite his earlier involvement in the consuls' revolt Galbiati became a staunch Mussolini loyalist in later years and opposed the motion against him on 25 July 1943. On the morning of that day he proposed to Mussolini the arrest of the nineteen gerarchi who had voted for the \\"OdG Grandi\\" (order of the day from Dino Grandi), but he refused. When news of Mussolini's arrest was released at 7 o'clock in the evening the headquarters of the MVSN in Viale Romania were surrounded by army units. Galbiati, who was in his office, ordered the MVSN not to provoke incidents. Although the majority of his officers wanted to react, after consulting with four generals he called the under-secretary of the interior Umberto Albini and told him that the MVSN would have \\"remained faithful to its principles, that is to serve the fatherland through its pair, Duce and King.\\" Rastrelli (2007) p. 31 After that, it was clear that the Blackshirts would have not reacted to the putsch. Shortly before midnight he was ordered to hand over control to the army general Quirino Armellini.Bianchi (1963), p. 732 Galbiati capitulated to Grandi's men and it has been argued that it was this that cost him high office in the Italian Social Republic. He served 11 months in prison after the war, before largely disappearing from the public eye. Bibliography *Carlo Rastrelli. Enzo Galbiati.

In 1993 the scope of the Commission included the compliance control, including exchange of catch data and inspections and coordination of various activities. This happened after it was revealed that after the dissolution of the Soviet Union Russian fishing vessels started delivering their catch to Norway rather than to Russia.

Appearance  Dellmensingen Castle is a plain and unadorned three-storey stone building, covered by a gabled roof.W. Willig, Landadel-Schl√∂sser in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, p. 131 History For a long period of time there were two castles in Dellmensingen: the Untere Burg (Lower Castle), surrounded by a moat, mentioned in the 15th century, of which no remains are visible today as it was completely demolished in 1809, and the Obere Burg (Upper Castle). Both castles were destroyed during the Thirty Years War.Beschreibung des Oberamts Laupheim, p. 155 When the owner of the village of Dellmensingen, Johann Karl von Stotzingen, canon at Augsburg and Regensburg, died without there being a male successor in 1647, Ellwangen Abbey, which had seignory over the Lower Castle, attempted to expand its rights over the whole village, including the Upper Castle. This claim, however, was rejected by Emperor Ferdinand III whereupon the ownership of the Upper Castle together with its rights over the village went to Georg Heinrich von Werdenstein, an official in the service of Kempten Abbey, in 1657.G. K√∂bler, Historisches Lexikon der deutsche L√§nder, p. 132 Consequently, Dellmensingen became the main seat of residence for the Barons of Werdenstein. The dilapidated Lower Castle was rebuilt in Baroque style in 1685. It consisted not only of the actual castle building but also of stables, barns, bakery, a cowshed and other agricultural buildings, surrounded by castle walls.Beschreibung des Oberamts Laupheim, p. 152 Castle Dellmensingen and its accompanying rights over the village remained in possession of the Barons of Werdenstein until 1796 when the last member of the family, Anton Christoph von Werdenstein, died without a male issue. The fiefdom of Dellmensingen returned to the Emperor.Beschreibung des Oberamts Laupheim, p. 156 During the German Mediatisation nuns of S√∂flingen Abbey, which was dissolved following its annexation by Bavaria, found temporary refuge in the castle in 1809.M. Erzberger, Die S√§kularisation in W√ºrttemberg von 1802-1810, p. 343 After Dellmensingen had become part of the newly founded Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg, the castle was sold into private hands, first, in 1814, to two patricians from Biberach, then to a citizen from the village of Asch in 1840 and finally to Count Karl Viktor Reuttner von Weyl from Achstetten in 1851. Between March and August 1942 Castle Dellmensingen was used as a so-called retirement home for Jews, where more than 100 elderly Jews were forced to live until their deportation to the death camps. 18 of the inhabitants died during their stay at the castle and were buried in the Jewish cemetery in Laupheim. In the autumn of 1942, the castle housed 23 families from Slovenia who were thought by the SS to be able to be Germanised. All of them returned to Slovenia in July 1945.A. K√∂hlerschmidt & K. Neidlinger, Die j√ºdische Gemeinde Laupheim und ihre Zerst√∂rung, p. 251 After the end of the Second World War the castle served as accommodation for ethnic Germans expelled from Eastern Europe and from 1947 until 1967 the charity organisation Caritas utilised the premises as an old people's home.H. K√§chler, Schl√∂sser um Ulm, p. 19 The then independent municipality of Dellmensingen bought the castle in 1955 from the Counts of Achstetten. In 1971, Castle Dellmensingen changed into private hands, followed by extensive interior renovation works.

When Gore broadcasts the description of the getaway car on a radio revival show, W.W. burns up his rare, distinctive car (see \\"Golden Anniversary\\" Oldsmobile subsection below). He is ready to separate from the Dancekings in order to shield them, but then he hears them rehearsing Wayne's new song. He persuades Country Bull to listen to it; the man is so impressed, he puts them on the Grand Ole Opry radio show. There, Gore catches W.W., using an exact replica of his burnt car as bait. Gore makes him drive to the police station, but just as they arrive, Gore realizes it is now Sunday, so rather than violate the Sabbath, he lets him go (with the car). Cast * Burt Reynolds as W.W.

Reynolds approved John Avildsen on the basis of a recommendation from Jack Lemmon, who had worked with the director on Save the Tiger. John Avildsen says Sylvester Stallone auditioned for a supporting role. He did not get the job, but the two worked together on Rocky, the director's next film. Reynolds wanted Dolly Parton to play the female lead. She declined, but the two later worked together on The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas. Filming was marked by tension between Reynolds and Avildsen. The two men did not get along professionally or personally, and there was often clashes in approach and temperament. \\"Golden Anniversary\\" Oldsmobile Example of a 1955 two-door Oldsmobile Holiday 88 One of the central props in the movie is the car that W.W. drives. In the film, it is described as a special 1955 \\"Golden Anniversary\\" Oldsmobile Rocket 88, of which only 50 were purportedly made. It is a four-door sedan painted gold with black hood and side accents and chrome trim. In reality, there was no such special model, and in any event, 1955 was not the 50th anniversary of Oldsmobile. Three such cars were custom-built for the film from stock 1955 Oldsmobiles.\\"The Way It Was\\", 1955 Olds Golden Anniversary. Classic & Custom magazine, October 1982. The three movie cars were built at Doug's Custom Shop in Nashville, Tennessee. One was destroyed in the fire scene, one was taken to a museum, and the third was used as the camera car, with the roof removed. Radio Shack in California had a promotional giveaway for the third car shortly after the movie was released. The Radio Shack connection is that Burt Reynolds and the Bandit movies created a demand for CB radios, which amounted to 30% of Radio Shack's sales during the height of the craze.

He is most notable for designing motorcycles for the Indian Company, including the original Indian Scout of 1920, the original Indian Chief of 1922, and the Indian 101 Scout of 1928. Prior to this, he had been part of the Indian motorcycle team that won first, second, and third place in the 1911 Isle of Man TT, finishing in second place. Franklin was inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 2016. Early life Franklin was born on 1 October 1880 to Lorenzo Bruce Clutterbuck Franklin, a shipwright and iron merchant, and his wife, Annie Honor Wrixon, n√©e Bayly. He was born at 1 St. Patrick's Villas, Whitworth Road, Drumcondra, Dublin; which became 18 Whitworth Road after the road was renumbered in 1883 or 1884. Three of his siblings died from scarlet fever in the previous year, and another, a sister, died from the disease and was buried four days after he was born. Franklin had already survived his own bout of scarlet fever when, in his teens, he contracted pneumonia and nearly died from it. Despite his illnesses, he became his parents' first child to survive to adulthood. Two of his younger brothers would also survive to adulthood. While at St. Andrew's College, Dublin, in which he enrolled in its foundation year of 1894, he lived with his paternal grandfather, Robert Franklin. Upon leaving St. Andrew's Franklin was accepted into the civil service and began training as an electrical engineer. Upon completion of his training Franklin was appointed to the post of engineer at the power station at Rathmines. Motorcycling career=Ireland (1903‚Äì1916) In 1903 Franklin began competing in reliability trials, hill climbs and beach racing. On 24 September 1904 he participated in the Auto Cycle Club's annual race meeting at Crystal Palace, London; his first track event and his first event outside Ireland. He won one of the five heats and finished third in the final. His first motorcycles were Belgian FN single- cylinder machines, which he rode in the reliability trials and beach speed trials in 1903 and 1904 and at the 1904 Crystal Palace event. As at May 1905 he had also ridden Humber and Royal Progress motorcycles. On 29 May 1905, Franklin competed as a private entrant at the Auto Cycle Club's trial on the Isle of Man on a \\"special\\" with a JAP V-twin engine in a Chater-Lea frame. The trial was used to select Britain's team for the Coupe International races of 1905. Only Ariel rider J. S. Campbell and Matchless rider (and co-owner) Harry Collier finished the trial; Franklin was selected as the third team member based on his speed and consistency during the trial. His participation in the 1905 Coupe International made him the first Irishman to participate in international motorcycle competition. Franklin competed with the British team in the 1906 Coupe International on another JAP special, this time with Harry Collier and his brother Charlie on Matchlesses. Discussions during the team's return from the 1906 Coupe International on the shortcomings of the organisation of the race led to the creation of the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy, which was first run the next year. Franklin entered the inaugural 1907 Tourist Trophy, but withdrew his entry two weeks before the race meet. Franklin entered every Isle of Man T.T. race from 1908 to 1914. When he finished, he finished in the top ten, but he did not finish in 1910 and 1912. His best finish in the Isle of Man T.T. was second place, where he was part of the Indian team that finished first, second, and third. Franklin began racing Indian motorcycles in 1910, and competed on one in the Tourist Trophy in May of that year. The riders of Indians at that race had persistent tyre problems; Franklin and three other Indian riders had tyre failures and did not finish. That August Franklin left his job at the Rathmines power station and became a dealer in Indian motorcycles. He rode and tuned Indians exclusively from then on. In June 1912 he rode an Indian eight-valve model at Brooklands to become the first man to cover 300 miles in 300 minutes. Franklin was recruited into the Indian company in late 1914 and tasked with establishment of an Indian depot in Dublin. The depot had opened by May 1915. The imposition of the McKenna duties in September 1915 led to the closing of Indian's Dublin depot in October 1916. Franklin, the manager of the depot, was given a position in the Indian's design department at their headquarters in Massachusetts, and left for the United States in November 1916. In June 1916, in his last race in Ireland, Franklin rode a Featherweight Model K two-stroke single, winning the prize for best performance by a motorcycle under 300 cc. United States (1916‚Äì1932) Although Franklin has been credited with the design of the 1917 Model O as one of his earliest assignments, it is not known for certain who designed this model and Franklin himself had only been at the factory for three months when it first went on sale at Indian dealerships in February 1917. A lightweight motorcycle with a flat-twin engine, this model was not successful and went out of production in 1919. Franklin certainly developed a high performance version of Charles Gustafson's Powerplus engine, to the extent that the side-valve engine became the main design used in American high-performance motorcycles, supplanting more expensive overhead valve, multiple valve, and overhead camshaft designs used earlier on racing motorcycles, and persisting well beyond World War II in Class C racing in the United States. Franklin then designed the 1920 Scout, a mid-sized motorcycle with a engine. Design improvements over Indian's larger motorcycles included a gearbox bolted to the engine and driven by helical-cut gears instead of a primary chain. Franklin's 1922 Indian Chief used a larger version of the Scout's drivetrain design. Compared to the Powerplus-powered motorcycle it replaced, the Chief had dual camshafts, gear drive similar to that of the Scout, and a wet clutch. After designing the 1925 Indian Prince, a single- cylinder lightweight motorcycle which preceded Harley-Davidson's equivalent single-cylinder models by one year Franklin generally approved Arthur Lemon's development of the Ace four-cylinder motorcycle design, which Indian acquired in 1927, and he redesigned the Scout for 1928. The resulting Indian 401 four- cylinder motorcycle and Indian 101 Scout had the same frame geometry, which, in the lighter 101 Scout, resulted in exceptional handling and stability. Franklin later designed a three-wheeled utility vehicle, the 1931 Dispatch Tow, based on the Model 101 frame. Franklin also designed highly successful racing motors in a range of valve configurations from side-valve to overhead- valve (both 2-valve and 4-valve) and overhead-cam. Death In the second half of 1931 Franklin took a leave of absence from Indian to rest and recover his health, although at first he continued to work from a drawing office at his home. He died from complications due to intestinal cancer during the night of 19 October 1932. He left behind his wife Annie (a.k.a. Nancye), whom he had married in Dublin in July 1907, and his daughter Phyllis, born in Dublin in September 1908. Nancye and Phyllis Franklin had arrived in the United States in May 1920.

This campaign was followed by the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, during which the regiment fought in both the major battles the Battle of Seedaseer and the Battle of Seringapatam. They were then used in the punitive expedition in the Beni Boo Ali campaign in 1821, against the pirates in Eastern Arabia and the Persian Gulf.

Biography Qarshe was born in 1924 in the Somali expatriate community in Moshi, Tanzania. He belonged to the Habar Yoonis sub clan of (Garhajis) Isaaq that mainly inhabits Sanaag region of Somaliland.http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/drought/docs/Renders%20Terlinden%20Somaliland%20Statehood%202010.pdf In 1931, at the behest of his family, he left Tanzania and settled in Aden, Yemen for his education. It is in Aden where Abdullahi had his first encounter with cinema and radio playing western films and Indian and Arabic music, which inspired him to buy a lute to accomplish his new goal of creating music in the Somali language. He was married to Adaiya Qarshe whom he had four children with, Rukiyo Qarshe, Safiyo Qarshe, Anab Qarshe and Mahad Qarshe. Qarshe, along with other first generation artists such as Ali Feiruz and Mohamed Nahari, was among the pioneers of modern Somali music. An innovative musician, Qarshe often employed a wide variety of instruments in his art, such as the guitar, piano and oud. He was also known for his poems and his theatrical work at Mogadishu and Hargeisa venues. The Balwo genre, was however founded by Abdi Sinimo as was mentioned by Qarshe. In an interview with Abdullahi Qarshe published by Bildhaan Vol. 2 page 80, he affirmed that \\"modern music was in the air at the time of Abdi Sinimo, who is widely regarded as the genius who formulated and organized it into the belwo and thus took well deserved credit and honor for it.\\" Qarshe introduced a new and shorter form of Heello by combining traditional Somali poetry with song. In the 1940s he created his first song Ka ka'ay (Arise). Qarshe utilized many of his Heello songs to express Pro-independence and anti-colonial sentiments. In tribute to Patrice Lumumba he wrote the song Lumumba ma noole mana dhimane (Lumumba is not alive neither is he dead) in 1960 . In 1957 he composed the current Somali National Anthem Qoloba Calankeeda waa cayn (Every nation has its own unique flag). In 1955 Qarshe founded the Walaalo Hargeisa troupe which performed various plays around Somalia, one of them being Soomaalidii Hore iyo Somaalidii dambe (Somalis present and past). Qarshe's 1961 song Aqoon la'aan waa iftiin la'aan(to be without knowledge is to be without light) was the signature tune of Radio Mogadishu. In addition, Qarshe was a member of the pioneering Somali musical ensemble Waaberi.

The ground was used by Hampshire County Cricket Club from 1882 to 2000, serving as one of three home grounds used during this period, alongside the County Ground, Southampton, and Dean Park, Bournemouth. United Services Portsmouth Cricket Club currently play at the ground. The ground is used in its dual capacity as a rugby venue by United Services Portsmouth Rugby Football Club, who have played there since 1882. The Royal Navy Rugby Union also use the ground for their home matches. The end names are the Railway End to the north and the Officer's Club End to the south. History=Early history Located to the north of Old Portsmouth, the area where the ground is located was a sea inlet in the 17th century, across which was a dam. The dam allowed the sea into the inlet when the tide came in, and when the tide went back out the dam was closed and the water was only allowed to escape under a watermill, named King's Mill, which powered the production of grain in the mill. After this, the land was gradually reclaimed from the sea. There is evidence that cricket has been played at the United Services Recreation Ground since 1852. The ground in its present location is said to have been made available following largescale demolition of defence works in the city during the 1870s. First- class cricket was first played there on 17, 18 and 19 August 1882, when the touring Australians played Cambridge University Past and Present. This first match was won by Cambridge University Past and Present by 20 runs, following an Australian batting collapse in which A. G. Steel took 5/24. Hampshire first played there a week after the first match, against Sussex in which they lost by an innings. Over the coming decade the ground was used once by G.N. Wyatt's XI, on three occasions by Oxford and Cambridge Universities Past and Present and twice by the East of England. Hampshire lost first-class status during this period and were considered a second-class county, though Hampshire did play at the ground once during this period against Sussex in 1888. The 1893 match between the Australians and Oxford and Cambridge Universities Past and Present was notable for the Australians setting what was then a record first- class innings score of 843. The amateur level Royal Artillery (Portsmouth) Football Club also played at the ground from 1894 until the club was dissolved in 1899 because of an 1898-99 FA Amateur Cup tie in which The Football Association expelled Royal Artillery Portsmouth from the competition for alleged 'professionalism'. Out of the ashes of Royal Artillery, the present day Portsmouth F.C. grew.https://thebeautifulhistory.wordpress.com/clubs/portsmouth/ The gated archway, in Burnaby Road, serves as the main entrance to the ground. The gate was previously part of King James' Gate, which stood in Broad Street and was the entrance to Old Portsmouth. Regular county venue Hampshire regained first-class status in 1895 and were admitted to the expanded County Championship. Hampshire played their first first-class match at the ground in thirteen years in that season when they played Leicestershire, which Hampshire won by 3 wickets, due in part to a five wicket haul from Jimmy Wootton and an unbeaten half century from Francis Quinton. Over the coming seasons, Hampshire tended to play two to three matches there per season. An 1897 fixture between Hampshire and Sussex saw Arthur Webb score Hampshire's first first-class century, while a match the following season which saw Surrey as the visitors drew a crowd of around 5,000. The ground Naval connection saw services players bought into the Hampshire team on occasion, including Admiral Hotham. The early 1900s saw little success for Hampshire at the ground, with the county winning just two of eighteen matches played at the ground from 1900 to 1907. Considered a weak Hampshire team at the time, the county finished last in the County Championship in 1900 and 1902‚Äì1905, it wasn't until 1907 that Hampshire won again at the ground thanks to 88 and 6/55 from Phil Mead against Somerset. The arrangement of playing three matches a season at the ground continued until World War I, while the first first-class match involving a services team took place in July 1911 when a combined Army and Navy team played a combined Oxford and Cambridge Universities team. After the war, Hampshire played Sussex there in 1919, a season which also saw the South play the Australian Imperial Forces, before the resumption of first three matches, then four matches per season being played there. 1920 saw Hampshire's first even double century opening wicket partnership between Alex Bowell and George Brown, with the two compiling a partnership of 204. The emergence of Alec Kennedy and Jack Newman during this period under the captaincy of Lord Tennyson led to stronger Hampshire performances, with Hampshire winning all three matches played at the ground in the 1921 season. The Combined Services played only their second ever first-class match in that same season against the Australians. Later in the 1920s, the Royal Navy played first-class cricket at the ground for the first time, against the 1927 touring New Zealanders. The first hat trick at the ground was taken by Stuart Boyes in 1925. Hampshire continued to play at the ground throughout the thirties, at a time when following the retirements of George Brown, Phil Mead, Jack Newman and Lord Tennyson Hampshire were a less successful team. Hampshire played four matches per season there during the thirties, with the exception of 1938 when they played five matches, before returning to four in 1939. Hampshire record partnership for the fifth wicket was made there in 1937, when Gerry Hill and Donald Walker put on 235, a record which stands to this day. World War II ended county cricket until 1946, and during the war Portsmouth was heavily bombed by the German Luftwaffe during The Blitz. The imposing Officer's Club building overlooks the ground, today it forms part of the University of Portsmouth's Nuffield Sports Centre. Post- World War II First-class cricket returned to the ground after the war, when Hampshire played Essex. Hampshire continued to play four matches per season there going into the 1950s. It was during this time that under the leadership of Desmond Eagar and Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie that the Hampshire team was beginning to become a powerful force in the county game. Coupled with the batting of Roy Marshall (who in five matches there in 1957 scored 549, an unbeaten record for the ground), Jimmy Gray and Henry Horton, and backed up with the bowling of Derek Shackleton, Victor Cannings and Malcolm Heath, Hampshire had a fairly successful period, finishing runners-up in 1958, before winning the County Championship for the first time in 1961, with Hampshire winning four of their five matches there in that season. They might have been successful in 1958, had it not been for two draws later in the season at the ground. A new format, List A cricket, was introduced in 1963, two years after its introduction, the ground held its first List A match when Hampshire played Kent in the 1965 Gillette Cup. Six first-class matches had been held there in 1962, before the schedule at the ground was reduced back to five, with the expansion of List A cricket with the Player's County League and John Player League, on average two or three List A matches were held there over the coming seasons. Hampshire were pressing for the Player's County League title in 1969, with a crowd of 8,000 watching their defeat to Essex. Hampshire finished that season's competition one point behind winners Lancashire. A first-class match in 1971 between Hampshire and the touring Pakistanis saw protests by Bangladeshis protesting Pakistani actions in the Bangladesh Liberation War. Hampshire won the County Championship for a second time in 1973, though the 1970s saw a gradual reduction in the number of first-class matches held there, by the end of that decade three first-class matches and two List A matches were granted to the ground each season. This decade also saw logistical problems for the ground, when at the Railway End trees were destroyed, whose removal interrupted the batsman line of sight. As such, no matches were held there in 1975, though the purchase of screens allowed county cricket to return in 1976. 1976 was also not without its problems, when a County Championship match against Yorkshire was interrupted by vandals who had attacked the pitch during the night. Despite this setback, the match continued on an adjoining strip of pitch. Later history and decline The ground saw a reduction in the number Hampshire fixtures it held during a season, with the number of List A matches dropping to two per season up until 1984, after which one match per season was held there. First-class cricket was reduced in 1980 to two matches per season. Hampshire played one match there in their 1986 John Player Special League winning run, defeating Warwickshire. Speculation about the grounds future use by Hampshire was mentioned as early as 1984, when a review of Portsmouth's history, published by Peter Thompson in The News, speculated whether ground would survive to see a century of county cricket in 1995. County cricket there did indeed carry on past the 1980s, with the start of the next decade saw two astonishing matches with Derbyshire as the visitors during the grounds \\"Cricket Week\\". Having recently defeated Nottinghamshire at the ground in the previous match, with Malcolm Marshall finishing with match figures of 9/94, Hampshire followed this up by recording their largest margin of victory in the Sunday League.Rahul Dravid (pictured) scored the final first-class century at the ground for Kent in 2000. Hampshire made 250 in their innings, before Paul-Jan Bakker and Cardigan Connor dismissed the visitors for just 61. To this day it is the joint lowest score Hampshire have dismissed a team for. In the County Championship match between the sides, Derbyshire looked on course to chase down their victory target of 235, when they were at 140/2. However, Malcolm Marshall took 7 wickets in 51 balls to hand Hampshire a 48 run victory. The local press described it as Marshall's \\"finest hour\\". Hampshire used the ground through most the 1990s. Feats included their highest shared match aggregate of 1,457 runs with Sussex in 1993, while the following season they made their fourth highest first-class total at the ground when they scored 512 against Durham. The pattern of holding two County Championship matches and one List A match per season continued through the 1990s, however Hampshire stayed away in 1999 as a result of poor pitch reports prior to the season and fear of points deductions by the ECB should they play on substandard pitches; it was only the second time since 1895 that county cricket had not been played in Portsmouth during a season. Hampshire returned in 2000, playing two first-class matches. The first saw New Zealand A defeat Hampshire after chasing down 337, just two short of the record chase at the ground by Surrey in 1937. The second saw Kent as the visitors, with Rahul Dravid scoring the grounds final first-class century, while Shaun Udal took the final wicket. Hampshire lost their final first-class match there by 6 wickets. Their final match there came days later in a List A fixture against Middlesex in the Norwich Union National League, which Hampshire lost by 4 wickets. With continued poor pitch reports and the centralisation of Hampshire's cricket at their new Rose Bowl ground, these matches marked the final time Hampshire would play at the ground. Hampshire played 314 first-class matches there, winning 104 (33%), which compares favourably with Hampshire's other main grounds of the time, with a 27% win ratio at Dean Park, Bournemouth, and a 26% win ratio at the County Ground, Southampton. Hampshire also played 54 List A matches there.

He later returned to the artillery, and commanded an anti-aircraft brigade during World War II. Biography Carbery was the son of Hugh John Carbery of Cork, Ireland, and was born in Ambala, India. He was educated at King's School, Bruton, Somerset, before attending the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, from where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery on 12 August 1914. World War I Carbery served in France and Belgium with the British Expeditionary Force from 15 December 1914 to 17 May 1915, gaining promotion to lieutenant on 9 June, and returning to active duty between 16 July 1915 and 25 April 1916. He was wounded twice. He was then seconded to the Royal Flying Corps to train as a pilot, receiving the Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate No. 3383 at Hounslow on 31 July 1916, flying a B.E.2c biplane, and was appointed a flying officer by the RFC on 4 August. He first served in No. 9 Squadron, a reconnaissance and artillery-spotting unit, and by early 1917 was serving in No. 52 Squadron. His first aerial victory came on 25 January, flying a R.E.8, driving a German aircraft down over Morlancourt, which was then captured. On 14 February, flying a B.E.2e, he shot down an Albatros D.III over St. Pierre. On 26 March 1917 he was awarded the Military Cross. His citation read: :Lieutenant Douglas Hugh Moffatt Carbery, Royal Field Artillery and Royal Flying Corps. :For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty while engaged on artillery observation. He was attacked by four hostile machines, which he succeeded in driving off and continued to carry out his observations. Later, he was again attacked by several hostile machines and succeeded in bringing one of them down. He has previously done fine work. On 26 August 1917 he was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain, and was promoted to captain on 3 November. On 30 August 1918, Carbery, now serving with No. 59 Squadron RAF, and flying a R.E.8, shot down a Fokker D.VII over Beugn√¢tre. On 8 September he destroyed a Halberstadt C over Gonnelieu, and another on 24 September. Early on 28 September 1918 Carbery and his observer Lieutenant J. B. V. Clements were on patrol, and after shooting down a Halberstadt C near Vacquerie-le-Boucq, they saw a German gun crew near Bapaume with a limbered gun. A message dropped to British guns for an artillery strike brought no result, so Carbery attacked the German gun with four bombs, then strafed the position, scattering the German troops, who abandoned the damaged gun near Achiet-le-Petit. The gun was subsequently captured and presented to Carbery as a war trophy. After the war he donated it to the RAF College at Cranwell, but kept one of the broken wheels, which later became the symbol of 59 Squadron. On 3 December 1918 he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. His citation read: :Captain Douglas Hugh Moffatt Carbery, MC. (Royal Field Artillery) :During recent operations this officer has displayed remarkable courage and skill in attacking hostile batteries, troops, etc., rendering valuable service in silencing the former and causing heavy casualties to the latter. In the air he is a bold and intrepid fighter. On 30 August he and his observer, attacked by seven Fokker biplanes, drove them off, shooting down one out of control. At the end of the war Carbery was awarded the 1914‚Äì15 Star, the British War Medal, and the Victory Medal. Inter-war career On 1 August 1919 Carbery was granted a permanent commission as a flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force. In July 1920 he was awarded a bar to his Distinguished Flying Cross for his services in the Third Anglo-Afghan War, and was also awarded the India General Service Medal with the clasp \\"Waziristan 1919‚Äì1921\\" for his services during the Waziristan campaign. However, Carbery then seems to have had a change of heart, as on 20 December 1920, his transfer to the RAF was cancelled. On 1 January 1921 Carbery relinquished his temporary commission in the RAF, and was restored to the establishment of the Royal Regiment of Artillery the following day. On 26 October 1927 he was appointed adjutant, serving in that post until 8 November 1929. He received a second clasp, \\"N.W. Frontier of India 1930‚Äì31\\", to his India General Service Medal for services during the Red Shirt and Afridi Rebellions, on the Indian North-West Frontier. He was promoted to major on 29 July 1933. World War II Carbery spent the first part of the war serving in the Royal Artillery's Coast Defence and Anti- Aircraft Branch. On 19 April 1940 he was appointed temporary lieutenant- colonel, and was confirmed in that rank on 1 February 1941. On 1 July 1942 he was appointed acting-colonel and acting-brigadier, to serve as Commanding Officer, 14th (West Africa) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, until 11 April 1943, seeing action in India and Burma. He was appointed a temporary brigadier on 1 January 1943, and was promoted to the rank of colonel on 1 February 1944. On 2 July 1946 Carbery retired and was granted the honorary rank of brigadier. Brigadier Carbery died at Lanner, Cornwall, on 27 April 1959. Personal life On 12 May 1932 Carbery married Violet Cecily Austin, the daughter of Sir William Michael Byron Austin, Bt. and Violet Irene Fraser. They had one child, Anne Irene Carbery, born in July 1935, who married Lieutenant-Commander Alexander Leonard Dominic Brown, RN, on 10 November 1956.

The Ackermans sold their products through their companies Jenev and ERA Industries. Evelyn was an accomplished artist and an author of books on antique toys and dolls.Alligator wood carved wall art designed by Evelyn Ackerman Jerome Ackerman Jerome Ackerman was born on January 29, 1920 in Detroit to Louis Ackerman and Esther Greenberg. Jerry graduated from Detroit‚Äôs Central High School in 1939 and enrolled at Wayne University (now Wayne State University) as an art major. In 1941, when the United States entered World War II, he left school to work in a naval ordnance plant and then joined the Air Force, serving as a control tower operator in Germany. In 1949, Jerry decided to complete his college education and returned to Wayne University under the GI bill. Among the many art classes he took at Wayne was ceramics taught by John Foster, who emphasized Chinese pottery and the work of Hamada and Bernard Leach. During Jerry‚Äôs senior year, Charles Harder, chairman of the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University, was the invited guest juror of the senior art exhibition at Wayne. Impressed by Jerry‚Äôs work, he offered him a place in the Alfred graduate program. Jerry received his MFA degree in ceramics in June 1952. As he reduced his time with ERA Industries, Jerry resumed his ceramic pursuits. While still a traditional studio potter, he introduced more whimsical, decorative elements into his hand-thrown pots. His studio pottery, comprising both functional pieces and sculptural forms, has appeared in gallery and museum exhibitions. Jerry died March 30, 2019 in Culver City, California at the age of 99. Evelyn Ackerman Evelyn Ackerman was born on January 12, 1924 in Detroit, Michigan to Jacob Lipchinsky (later changed to Lipton) and Sara Turetsky. Evelyn graduated from Central High School in 1941, and began at the University of Michigan as an art major. Then, in 1942, her father died and her three brothers entered the military. With her mother in need of help, she transferred to Wayne University as a fine arts and art history major. There she was introduced to the German Expressionists, Rembrandt, C√©zanne, Klee, and Matisse by her art history professor, Dr. Ernst Scheyer. After completing her BFA degree with distinction in 1945, Evelyn completed her MFA degree in fine arts in 1950. After retiring from ERA Industries, Evelyn spent a year and a half creating a 40-piece series of cloisonn√© enamels with silver wire on copper completing the project in 1979. The series Stories from the Bible was donated to the permanent collection of the Renwick Gallery, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C.Smithsonian American Art Museum website, retrieved February 5, 2011, http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=35304 Over the years, Evelyn collected antique toys and dolls. She authored articles and published five books on antique dolls and toys. Her successful pattern books for dressing antique dolls, the first that were based on research and were authentic expressions of the dress of the period, were reissued. In the 1980s, she volunteered at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art of Art Costume and Textile department and wrote a monograph on nineteenth-century dress and an extensive glossary for a catalogue of eighteenth-century costumes and textiles. Eveyln died in Culver City, California at age 88 in 2012. Personal life Jerome and Evelyn were married on September 12, 1948. Shortly after marrying, Jerry and Evelyn visited his parents, who had moved to Los Angeles. While there, they met Beatrice Wood and Gertrud and Otto Natzler. They also met John Follis, who, with Rex Goode, designed a series of large-scale ceramic planters they sold to Max and Rita Lawrence, who formed Architectural Pottery. As art students in 1949, Evelyn and Jerry found inspiration for a creative vision that changed their life and career. ‚ÄúFor Modern Living,‚Äù an exhibition organized by Alexander Girard at the Detroit Institute of Arts, showcased the work of several innovative contemporary designers, including Ray and Charles Eames and George Nelson furniture, Kurt Versen lighting, and V‚ÄôSoske carpets. ‚ÄúIt opened our eyes to an exciting new way of thinking and design expression. \\"We thought, if the Eames can do it, why can‚Äôt we?‚Äù remembers Jerry.\\"Seeing Things  Marriage by Design\\" Brooke Hodge, January 20, 2011. The New York Times Style Magazine. Retrieved February 10, 2011. http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/20/seeing-things-marriage-by- design/ In 1952 the Ackermans moved to Los Angeles and in 1960 daughter Laura was born. Jenev Design Studio In 1952, renting a small space at 2207 Federal Avenue in West Los Angeles, the Ackermans opened Jenev Design Studio, a combination of their first names. With very little money, they set about building a successful career based on ingenuity, talent, and hard work. Jerry began creating his first group of slip cast pottery, using the skills he had honed at Alfred. Designing shapes, making molds, and developing glazes consumed nearly a year. Jenev‚Äôs first client was Jules Seltzer, owner of a Los Angeles showroom for modernist furniture. During this same period, they also designed a number of products for Cal Pacific Imports. As sales increased, the Jenev ceramics line was marketed nationally by independent sales representatives. It was also personally selected by Paul McCobb for sale in his Directional Showroom. Jerry and Evelyn‚Äôs work began to appear in the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù section of the Los Angeles Times and House and Garden as well as other newspapers, home furnishing and interior design magazines, and trade journals. The Ackermans met and became friends with fellow members of the American Ceramic Society, including Peter Voulkos, Otto and Vivika Heino, Malcolm Leland, and Laura Andreson. In 1955, intrigued by a mosaic in a San Francisco exhibition, Evelyn began designing mosaics for tables and wall panels. Many of the designs were featured in home and interior magazines, as well as in the ‚ÄúCalifornia Design‚Äù exhibitions. While Evelyn initially made all the prototypes, she and Jerry soon realized that she would not be able to keep up with demand. They established a mosaic workshop in Mexico so that Evelyn could focus solely on creating new designs and be assured of a steady supply of product. ERA Industries In 1956, the Ackermans bought a three-bedroom Los Angeles tract house with a partially completed work studio. A design associate of architect A. Quincy Jones helped them complete the studio, and the couple began filling the space with hand-crafted objects including wood panels carved by Evelyn Ackerman.The Los Angeles Times, retrieved February 10, 2011. http://www.latimes.com/features/home/la-hm-0328-ackerman- pg,0,3913871.photogallery That same year Jerry reconnected with a high school classmate, Sherrill Broudy. Sharing a love of architecture and design, they decided to become business partners. Jenev became ERA Industries, the name the business retains to this day. After several years, the Ackermans bought Broudy out. With this transition, the couple began to apply their talents to a wider variety of media, designing home accessories and architectural elements in the form of textiles, wood, metal, and mosaic. They employed an innovative combination of traditional techniques and modern production approaches‚ÄîEvelyn Ackerman focused on designing, while her husband managed the business side of their venture. Always exploring new materials, Jerry and Evelyn became interested in several processes involving aluminum and created a number of special commissions. Warrior King was selected for the second ‚ÄúCalifornia Design‚Äù exhibition at the Pasadena Art Museum. Evelyn had taken weaving in college and they decided to add woven tapestries to their product line. It soon became apparent that Evelyn alone could not meet the demand. They found a family of skilled weavers outside of Mexico City to execute the designs, working with the family for more than 25 years. Evelyn‚Äôs first design, Hot Bird, featured on the cover of the Los Angeles Times ‚ÄúHome‚Äù section, was followed by a steady stream of new tapestries. Evelyn also designed a number of wall hangings that were silk-screened onto fabric. The Ackermans decided it was time to have their own showroom for the architecture and design trade featuring their unique designs. They opened their first showroom in 1959 on Melrose Avenue and San Vicente Boulevard, across from where the Pacific Design Center is now located. In 1964, when they outgrew their showroom on Melrose, they moved to larger quarters on Beverly Boulevard, across from the Herman Miller showroom. This location, in the heart of the design trade, offered premier exposure and better opportunities for dealing with architects and interior designers. In the following years, Jerry and Evelyn created designs individually and as a team as the business grew. At this juncture Jerry decided to concentrate on product design and development and marketing. Contract furnishings and interior design represented a large market. Ackerman designs were featured at major department stores such as Bloomingdale‚Äôs, Macy‚Äôs, and Bullock‚Äôs, as well as at established contemporary design stores across the country. To better serve these clients, the Ackermans decided to showcase the work of other artists and craftsmen and pursue more custom projects. At the same time, they realized the need to continually add new designs to each of their lines. One of the most popular lines was a group of hand-hooked wall hangings Evelyn designed that were produced in Japan. The Ackermans‚Äô knowledge of traditional craft techniques led them to utilize the handwork skills of craftsmen in Greece, Kashmir, Italy, Japan, and Mexico. By pursuing limited production runs, they were able to maintain high quality while keeping their products affordable. Detailed instructions, with full-size drawings and color keys, were sent for each new design. By adding new designs on a regular basis, they were able to maintain a fresh look in their lines. While many of their artist-craftsmen peers became known for working in one medium and style, the Ackermans‚Äô creative expression was multifaceted, broad, and diverse. Evelyn‚Äôs versatile design styles ranged from geometric minimalism to biomorphic abstraction to whimsical stylization. She and Jerry were able to translate imagery from one medium to another. The same design could be made as a woven tapestry as well as reproduced in metal, mosaic, or wood to maximize both the development investment and the design‚Äôs appeal. In order to accommodate homeowners‚Äô differing tastes, Evelyn developed palettes for textiles and mosaics in both cool and warm color schemes. Jerry adapted production techniques to create products that still had a handcrafted look. Woodcarvings, for example, were first roughed out using the furniture manufacturing technique of multiple spindle carving, then each piece was hand finished by a carver. Evelyn designed a series of modular carved wood panels with tongue-and-groove details for their former business partner, Sherrill Broudy, to be used in architectural applications. These panels formed the nucleus for Broudy‚Äôs company Panelcarve (later Forms+Surfaces). One of Evelyn‚Äôs most popular carved wood designs was the Ucello series. Responding to a need for more well-designed, contemporary cabinet hardware, Jerry designed a new series. His hand-cast solid brass pulls and knobs were produced in Italy with a variety of inlays and finishes. They supplemented ERA‚Äôs line of recessed plastic pulls with pulls produced in Denmark and designed by Count Sigvard Bernadotte. From the beginning, much of the Ackermans‚Äô work was special commissions. In 1968 Evelyn began the execution of 12 custom 6¬¥ x 8¬¥ needlepoint tapestries for the new Litton Industries corporate office in Beverly Hills. The tapestries were made in Greece using Evelyn‚Äôs full-size drawings and specifications. The project took a year and a half to complete. By the late 1980s, they decided to cut back on designing and manufacturing new products for ERA. Jerry represented several other lines of fine interior and architectural products and continued to work with the architects and interior designers with whom he had long-standing relationships. The Ackermans refocused their creative energies on individual projects, returning to their home studio. Awards * Museum of California Design (MOCAD), Los Angeles.

Declared by Lha-bzang Khan of the Khoshut Khanate on June 28, 1707, he was the only unofficial Dalai Lama. While praised for his personal moral qualities, he was not recognized by the bulk of the Tibetans and Mongols and is not counted in the official list of the Dalai Lamas. Appointment as Dalai Lama Pekar Dzinpa, later known as Yeshe Gyatso, was born in 1686 near the banks of Dzun Khulkhawa Karpo in Kham.Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa, One hundred thousand moons. Leiden 2010, p. 422. He may have been the natural son of the Khoshut prince Lha-bzang Khan.Alex McKay (ed.), The history of Tibet, Vol. II. London & New York 2003, p. 569. He entered the Drepung Monastery at a young age in 1699 and later moved to the Chakpori Hill in Lhasa, where he stayed at the medical college.Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa 2010, p. 422. The Khoshut rulers were protector-kings of Tibet from 1642 to 1717, but had a limited political role since the Dalai Lama or his desi (regent) held most of the authority. The ambitious Lha-bzang Khan succeeded to the royal dignity in 1703 and set out to change this. In 1705 he eliminated the powerful desi Sangye Gyatso and then moved against the young 6th Dalai Lama, Tsangyang Gyatso, whose libertine conduct he resented. Tsangyang Gyatso was arrested and declared deposed. The king, collaborating with the imperial Chinese authorities, dispatched the prisoner towards the Qing Dynasty court in Beijing. However, Tsangyang Gyatso died on the way in November 1706, either murdered or succumbing to illness. At this time Pekar Dzinpa was still a lama at the Chakpori medical college.Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa 2010, p. 409. Now Lha-bzang Khan pointed out the young man as the real 6th Dalai Lama. He officially proclaimed his supposed son in 1707 under the pretext that Tsangyang Gyatso had been erroneously initiated as the reincarnation of the 5th Dalai Lama (d. 1682). The Panchen Lama gave him both novice vows and the vows of full ordination at a grand ceremony before the Jowo image in Lhasa. As Dalai Lama he received the name Ngawang Yeshe Gyatso, or Yeshe Gyatso for short.Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa 2010, pp. 409-10. In Beijing the Kangxi Emperor initially supported the claim and issued an official recognition on 10 April 1710, thus dunning the Tibetans to recognize him and obey Lha-bzang Khan.Alex McKay 2006, p. 569. Contested claims The new Dalai Lama was praised for his moral behaviour and considered a great holder of religious authority. Nevertheless, the vast majority of the Tibetans and Mongols regarded the young man as an usurper and imposter, and he was never recognized by the Buddhist clergy. People irreverently referred to him as Kuzhap Pekar Dzinpa (Mr. Pekar Dzinpa).Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa 2010, p. 410, 422. Shortly afterwards, Tibetans in Eastern Tibet announced that they had found the reincarnation of the recently deceased Tsangyang Gyatso, thus the 7th Dalai Lama, near Lithang in the province of Kham. The boy had been born in September 1708, and would later be known by the name Kelzang Gyatso. He was recognized by two Khoshut princes in Amdo and caught the interest of the Kangxi Emperor. Seeing the boy as a possible means of increasing Qing influence in Tibet, he brought him to the Kumbum Monastery, out of reach of Lha-bzang Khan.Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa, Tibet: A political history. New Haven & London 1967, p. 134. Tibet was suddenly overrun by an invasion by the Dzungar people in 1717. Lha-bzang Khan was killed in battle in Lhasa in November in the same year, and the country was occupied by the newcomers, who led a hard rule. The Dzungar leaders considered Yeshe Gyatso an imposter and deposed him. The Panchen Lama Lobsang Yeshe pleaded with the Dzungar not to kill the young man or his siblings, but did not receive a clear reply. However, Yeshe Gyatso was not ill-treated but merely confined to the Chakpori medical college.Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa 1967, p. 137. The Dzungar occupation of Tibet lasted until 1720 when a Qing expedition expelled the occupants. Kelzang Gyatso was brought from Kumbum to Lhasa in the same year and enthroned in the Potala on 15 October 1720. Yeshe Gyatso was taken out from Chakpori. His fate is not entirely clear from the sources, but it seems that he was deported to China where he died in 1725.Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa 1967, p. 140. During the Losar festival in early 1726 the 7th Dalai Lama blessed the merits of the deceased Yeshe Gyatso, indicating that any hostility between the rival Dalai Lamas had ceased by this time due to Yeshe Gyatso's loss of political significance. The latter must nevertheless have had some followers, since his supposed reincarnation was discovered in Kham. However, the child soon died from smallpox and no more incarnations were reported.Luciano Petech, China and Tibet in the early 18th century: History of the establishment of Chinese protectorate in Tibet.

It was bestowed to the participants of the First Franco-Dahomean War (1890) and of the Second Franco-Dahomean War (1892‚Äì1894) in order to commemorate their feats of arms. In 1892, France decided to send an expeditionary force of 1,801 Europeans and 1,769 natives under the command of Marine Infantry Colonel Alfred Dodds in response to the harassment of the kingdom of Porto-Novo under its protectorate and its trading posts on the coast of Dahomey by the troops of Behanzin, the king of Abomey. The troops taking part in this expedition, which lasted five months, defeated the 12,000 warrior strong army (including the 2000 women strong Corps of amazons) of Behanzin at Dogba. France thus reconquered the kingdom of Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) and placed at its head, Toffa as the king of Porto-Novo. King Behanzin was captured in 1893 and deported to Martinique then to Algiers where he died in 1906. The Law of 24 November 1892 instituted the Commemorative Medal of the Dahomey Expedition for award to the officers, sailors and soldiers who took part in this campaign. Award statute The Dahomey Expedition commemorative medal was awarded by the President of France on propositions by the minister responsible for the service in which the recipient served. It was awarded to all officers, sailors and soldiers who served in the Dahomey campaigns. All recipients were to adhere to the code of conduct as set under the Grand chancellor of the Legion of honour. Posthumous awards were made to the widow or parents of the recipient.

In the theater world, Nitzberg is best known for writing the book and lyrics for two musicals. His first musical was \\"The Beastly Bombing or A Terrible Tale of Terrorists Tamed by the Tangles of True Love.\\" Nitzberg wrote the book and lyrics and directed this musical in Los Angeles and New York. The Beastly Bombing won the LA Weekly Theater Award for Best Musical of the Year. His second musical was \\"For the Love of a Glove: An Unauthorized Musical Fable About the Life of Michael Jackson As Told By His Glove.\\" Early life Nitzberg was born and raised in The Bronx. His mother was an Austrian Holocaust survivor; his maternal grandfather was conductor and composer Hans Knauer, who had studied under Franz Leh√°r and who had conducted the premiere of Lehar's opera Eva before Austrian emperor Franz Josef. As a child, Nitzberg spent three years living in Great Britain and Vienna. Upon returning to America, he attended the Horace Mann School in New York City. At age 16, Nitzberg became a founding member and guitarist of the notorious Lower East Side hardcore punk band Artless. They frequently played with Minor Threat, Swans, Flipper and other prominent punk bands. Mykel Board was their lead singer. Darryl Jenifer of the Bad Brains was Artless‚Äô second guitarist. Nitzberg was known for antagonizing and getting into fights with skinhead members of the audience. Artless' self-titled first album was produced by Dr. Know of the Bad Brains. The band broke up when Nitzberg left New York City to attend college. He took one year off from college during which he drove a New York City yellow cab. The Wild World of Hasil Adkins (1993) After college, Nitzberg moved to the Appalachian Mountains, where he was hired at the media collective Appalshop Films. While working there he directed his first documentary The Wild World of Hasil Adkins, One Man Band And Inventor of the Hunch for PBS‚Äô Headwaters TV Series. Known for composing songs about decapitation, abnormal sex and commodity meats, Hasil Adkins created in the 1950s a bizarre original form of rockabilly, later dubbed ‚Äúpsychobilly‚Äù and was a major influence on punk bands including The Cramps who covered his song ‚ÄúShe Said.‚Äù During the filming, Adkins suffered a nervous breakdown and threatened to ‚Äúkill and kick‚Äù Nitzberg, delaying the film's completion for over a year. Nitzberg had to persevere through these death threats and other psychotic episodes from Adkins, in order to finally capture the life story of a performer known just as much for his drunkenness, unpredictability and frequent arrests as for his unique music. During the filming of the Adkins documentary, Nitzberg encountered the legendary mountain dancing White Family, whom he documented in The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia. He met Mamie White in 1989 while shooting an Adkins concert; during the concert, a three-woman fight broke out which Mamie White broke up while tripping on acid. Mamie insisted that Nitzberg come meet her tap-dancing brother Jesco White at her birthday party where she promised Nitzberg that she would have a birthday cake with an image of woman's breasts and genitals on it. He went to her rural trailer and was intrigued by the White family. He returned the following week to film the first footage of Jesco and Mamie White. This footage became the basis of the Emmy Award-winning documentary Dancing Outlaw, on which Nitzberg served as associate producer and sound man. This footage was later released as a bonus track on The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia DVD. Bury Me in Kern County and Early Work in Hollywood After finishing filming The Wild World of Hasil Adkins, Nitzberg moved to California to attend the MFA program of the California Institute of the Arts, studying under Alexander Mackendrick, director of The Ladykillers and Sweet Smell of Success. Nitzberg wrote and filmed his first feature film, Bury Me in Kern County, a ‚Äúwhite trash black comedy‚Äù set in the mid-eighties, as part of his studies. It featured the debut of Mary Lynn Rajskub; the soundtrack was produced by the Dust Brothers and included songs by The Muffs, Beck, C.C. DeVille, Dub Narcotic Sound System, The Upper Crust and Sukia (band). Bury Me in Kern County debuted at the South by Southwest Film Festival in Austin, Texas. It was dubbed one of the ‚Äúbuzz films‚Äù of the festival by the Austin American-Statesman. Godfrey Cheshire in Variety raved about the film calling it ‚Äúan impressively assured and pro debut,‚Äù as well as declaring that ‚Äúit's reassuring that original, fiercely committed indie satires like this one are still emerging.‚Äù Bury Me in Kern County toured the festival circuit, receiving acclaim at such varied festivals as Montreal, Palm Springs, New York Underground and Chicago Underground. Entering the world of Hollywood, Nitzberg became a successful screenwriter, writing for HBO, SHOWTIME, TNT, VH1 and NBC. The Beastly Bombing (2006) In 2006, Nitzberg wrote the book and lyrics for the controversial musical The Beastly Bombing or A Terrible Tale of Terrorists Tamed by the Tangles of True Love, which he also directed. The music was written by composer Roger Neill, who also acted as co-producer and music director. The Beastly Bombing was inspired by such works of Gilbert and Sullivan as The Pirates of Penzance, Nitzberg decided to craft a plot revolving around lovable terrorists, portraying them in the same spirit as Gilbert and Sullivan's lovable pirates. The Beastly Bombing told the story of two Al Qaeda terrorists who show up in New York to blow up the Brooklyn Bridge. Getting to the bridge they discover two Timothy McVeigh-inspired white supremacists who have shown up at the same time with the same plan. The terrorists despise each other at first but then, in song, eventually discover a mutual hatred of Jews and bond before being forced to disguise themselves as Hasidic Jews to escape capture by the police. On the run, they fall in love with two girls who turn out to be the president's daughters who have escaped from rehab. The Beastly Bombing drew comparison to Mel Brooks and was dubbed by The Huffington Post: ‚Äúthe first great work of comedy to emerge from the post-9/11 little planet of horrors.‚Äù The play also had its detractors. Stephen Schwartz, the composer of Wicked and Godspell, called The Beastly Bombing ‚Äúthe most offensive and morally unredeemable musical I‚Äôve ever heard.‚Äù The show became a sellout cult hit attracting celebrities including Diane von Furstenberg, John C. Reilly, Spike Jonze, Paul Reiser, Stephen Gaghan and Liev Schreiber. At the prestigious LA Weekly Theater Awards, The Beastly Bombing won the Musical of the Year Award. After playing over a year in Los Angeles, The Beastly Bombing was staged in New York, Chicago and Amsterdam. The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia (2009) Nitzberg next directed the documentary The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia for Dickhouse Productions. This film was the first non-Jackass feature produced by Johnny Knoxville and Jeff Tremaine. Knoxville had been a fan of Nitzberg's documentary about Hasil Adkins, and of The Beastly Bombing. Having seen Nitzberg's early footage of Jesco White, Knoxville and Nitzberg convinced Nitzberg to return to West Virginia, in order to film a feature around the rest of the White family. Nitzberg spent eighteen months with the notorious family of Jesco White, documenting their history as dancers, criminals and the impact of the coal mining culture upon them. Shot cin√©ma v√©rit√© style, the film followed four generations of the White family as they flowed in and out of prison and scrambled to get by in rural West Virginia. The film also featured sequences featuring Jesco White tap dancing, accompanied by Hank Williams III. The film debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival and was one of the first films distributed by Tribeca Film's distribution arm. It was an immediate success, knocking Best Picture Oscar winner, The Hurt Locker, from Amazon's top video-on-demand spot. It also aired on Showtime. Upon release, Xeni Jardin of Boing Boing proclaimed it ‚Äúa masterpiece.‚Äù Chris Morris in Variety said ‚ÄúDrinking, gas-huffing, drug dealing and drug-taking (and rehab), brawling, infidelity, armed robbery, attempted murder, incarceration and parole -- it's all here. The Whites make Faulkner's Snopeses look like the Royal Family.‚Äù A.O. Scott in The New York Times reviewed it favorably, noting, ‚ÄúIts governing spirit, captured in the raucous music that punctuates the story (including songs performed live by Hank Williams III), is one of outlaw celebration. An anthology of country standards unfolds in real life and real time: murder ballads, cheating songs and rebel hollers, with an occasional pause for fatalistic spiritual meditation. One thing is certain, and is in a way the whole point of this fascinating and problematic documentary: The Whites don't care what you or anyone else thinks of them.‚Äù For the Love of a Glove In 2020, Nitzberg premiered the musical \\"For the Love of a Glove: An Unauthorized Musical Fable About the Life of Michael Jackson As Told By His Glove\\" in Los Angeles, California. Many years earlier Nitzberg had been approached to write a television bio-pic of Michael Jackson for a cable network but had been stymied about how to find a creative way to address the bizarre and controversial parts of Michael Jackson's life, including the allegations of child abuse. Inspired by writers like Nikolai Gogol, the Theatre of the Absurd, Franz Kafka and Monty Python, Nitzberg decided to take a surrealist approach and have the story be told by Michael Jackson's glove. In his version of the story, the glove was one of five alien brothers who came to Earth to take the planet over and used the Jackson 5 to help achieve their goals. When the television network decided it only wanted to pursue a conventional bio-pic, he decided to tell the story as a stage musical instead. The show utilized a mixture of puppets and actors to tell the story. The young Jackson 5 were played by life size puppets inspired by the Japanese Bunraku school of puppetry. The aliens were also portrayed by puppets. True to the Bunraku style, all of the puppeteers were visible and part of the show. The first act of the musical focused on the early years of the Jackson 5 at Motown. The second act centered on the year Michael Jackson recorded and released Thriller. Although the work was satirical in nature, Nitzberg explained to Forbes that he did not want to make fun of abuse or the allegations against Jackson. He told Forbes, ‚ÄúThis is not an attack on Michael Jackson, that's the thing. Some people don't seem to understand that. We‚Äôve entered this ‚Äòcancel culture‚Äô period where no-one has an idea of complexity. We need to get to a state of ‚Äòprocess culture‚Äô where we process who, or what, someone is and deal with it. There are lots of people who have made great music and done or been accused of doing bad or questionable things. If you started erasing anyone or anything with a question mark over it, significant chunks of the history of rock and roll would have to be gone. You can't ignore these question marks.‚Äù Andrew Limbong on NPR‚Äôs Weekend Edition called the show ‚ÄúRaunchy, surreal and absurd... While For the Love of a Glove isn't a hagiographic jukebox musical, it also isn't interested in tearing Michael Jackson down completely.‚Äù In his interview with him, Nitzberg told NPR, \\"He's the King of Pop... And theater usually deals with flawed kings, flawed gods, etc.\\" One of the major themes of the musical was exploring the effects of American racism and cultural appropriation on Michael Jackson. A central part of the story became what Nitzberg called the Amadeus/Salieri relationship between Michael Jackson and Donny Osmond. The Osmonds were considered by many to be a white knock off of the Jackson 5 and the Osmonds‚Äô early hit ‚ÄúOne Bad Apple‚Äù sounded so much like a Jackson 5 song that Michael's mother Katherine Jackson thought it was the Jackson 5. The Osmonds also were Mormons who taught at that time that black people were cursed by the Mark of Cain. In the Mormon teachings all black people were descended from Cain. They taught that because Cain had killed Abel, God had punished him by turning him black. As a consequence of this curse, all blacks were barred from Mormon temples. Mormons also taught that the Mark of Cain would in the end of days be removed from black people and at this time they would turn white. This also became a major part of the musical being featured in Donny Osmond's song from the show ‚ÄúWhat a Delight When You Turn White.‚Äù In the show, Michael Jackson's wish to turn white in his lifetime was explained as part of him wanting to get revenge on Donny Osmond. The story also put great emphasis on the trauma Michael Jackson suffered by being raised in the Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses religion. It delved into the religion's homophobic and sex negative teachings and how that may have scarred Jackson. Nitzberg explained ‚ÄúJehovah's Witnesses have a really fucked up attitude toward sexuality. They teach that masturbating can turn you gay because as a man you get used to a man's hand on your penis and want other men's hands on your penis. I thought this was hilarious. How did MJ get raised in this religion and then his most famous dance move winds up being him grabbing his own crotch? I then realized he didn't do the crotch grab, his alien glove forced him to do it!‚Äù Nitzberg wrote the script and lyrics and also directed the show. The music in the show was completely original and was written by Nicole Morier, Drew Erickson and Max Townsley. Choreography was by Cris Judd and Bryan Anthony. Cris Judd was Michael Jackson's former lead dancer on the HIStory World Tour. It was the premiere production at the Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan Theater in Los Angeles. All the reviews were positive.

Stage Raw's Stephen Fife wrote, ‚ÄúOf course, the subject of Michael Jackson couldn't be more controversial, especially in the wake of HBO's documentary Leaving Neverland. All I can say (having written The 13th Boy, my own story of being sexually molested) is that Nitzberg has found a very clever way of raising the subject without in any way diminishing its importance.‚Äù The LA Weekly‚Äôs Nikki Kreuzer wrote, ‚ÄúEnter the wryly brilliant mind of Julien Nitzberg and his bizarre yet fantastical new musical For the Love of a Glove. Nitzberg takes the timeline of Jackson's life, based in well-documented music history, and expands the story into surreal absurdity even while consciously weaving in sociological, political and religious commentary... Part Peter Pan, part scathing social commentary, part music biography and a fully comedic audience experience, this is no children's puppet show! Suspend your disbelief, check your political correctness at the door and go see this off-the-wall show with an open mind while preparing yourself for a comical, culturally warped adventure.‚Äù Stage and Cinema's Marc Wheeler reviewed the show saying it was ‚Äúa cleverly constructed, uproarious oddity that feeds our collective desire for catharsis through humor. The show, in all its absurdities, is a theatrical manifestation of our collective psyche in processing the unthinkable. One can't help but appreciate the profound genius in staging a show of such outrageous cosmic conceit.‚Äù Dangerous Minds‚Äô Howie Pyro wrote, ‚ÄúIn these days of modern mass paranoia and casual racism, over-sensitivity and dumbing down of all things, even I had a flash of looking behind me (as I saw others do) and wondering if this was cool to like, who was getting offended, who was laughing, and right then at that moment I realized I have been way more affected by all this modern bullshit than I thought. We need people like Julien Nitzberg to remind and instill in us that it is not only okay, but quite necessary to think, laugh (at ourselves AND at others) and learn.‚Äù The Compton Herald's K. Gerard Thomas and Denise Thomas wrote, ‚ÄúThis is a raw, unapologetic, ala Mel Brooks, immensely funny view of Michael Jackson's life, told from the perspective of his best friend ‚Äì the iconic silver glove. Theater-goers will definitely have something to discuss afterwards as the play seeks to push the audience's sensibilities to and fro ‚Äì one moment enamored with Jackson, another perplexed by him. It truly reflects what fans felt about his intriguing life.‚Äù The show suspended its successful run because of the coronavirus pandemic. Other Projects In 2007, Nitzberg wrote the script Sputnik Monroe for HBO Films. The script was based on his time spent with Monroe, a white professional wrestler who used his popularity to force sporting arenas throughout the South to integrate. He also sold a pilot to HBO called The Tribe about ‚Äúa family of contemporary Hasidic and secular Jewish criminals inspired by a number of weird true cases.‚Äù This was co-written with The Devil and Daniel Johnston director Jeff Feuerzeig.

In 2011, Nitzberg sold a pilot to the USA Network based on This American Life contributor David Ellis Dickerson's memoir about working at Hallmark Greeting Cards. It was called House of Cards (no connection with the TV series starring Kevin Spacey). In 2012 Nitzberg directed the Ashton Kutcher-produced documentary Patton Oswalt: To Be Loved & Understood, which dealt with the struggles of comedian Patton Oswalt with depression, and how that struggle impacted his unique brand of comedy. Nitzberg has written for a number of magazines. He conducted the first ever interview with Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, which was published in the Feral House book Technological Slavery. He also has directed music videos for a number of bands including King Missile, Beat Happening, and Monotonix.

During World War I, Wood served as an officer in the Kite Balloon Wing of the Royal Flying Corps, and was responsible for spotting planes from a hot-air balloon. The duty was dangerous, and Wood was decorated by the French for his action over Vimy Ridge. Wood's patriotic designs were published by Dobson Molle & Co. A Lawson Wood ad for Prestone Anti-Freeze. After the war, his animal designs were published by Inter-Art and Valentine, and his bird, animal, and human designs were reproduced as a line of wooden toys known as \\"The Lawson Woodies\\".

Wood worked in pen and ink, pencils, chalk, and watercolour. He used a specially made enamel palette about one foot (300mm) square and worked on Milburn Drawing Board at an architects desk. Houfe said that most of Wood's work was \\"humorous in drawing and content, his repertoire of characters including peppery army officers, namby-pamby men and dominating old dames. The figures are heavily caricatured and he was one of the group of artists who made capital out of imaginary prehistoric scenes.\\" Kelly calls a watercolour by Wood \\"a welcome holiday from the prehistoric monsters and chimpanzees on which he wasted so much talent.\\" Peppin and Micklethwait cite Percy Bradshaw as saying the Wood had a \\"breadth, ease and fluency which many an infinitely more serious artist must envy\\".

He was one of the few figures ostensibly on the left wing of Italian politics to publicly support Benito Mussolini, declaring for the fascist leader in 1922.Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism 1914-1945, 2001, p. 108 Life Giulietti became a seaman in 1905 and soon became a leading figure in their union Federazione Italiana dei Lavoratori del Mare (FILM), where he gained a reputation as a strong negotiator and was appointed union president in 1910.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, p. 149 Having joined the Italian Socialist Party in 1903 he affiliated FILM to the party once appointed President.Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right, p. 150 He saw service with the Regia Marina during the First World War and during his service he became more nationalist in thought. He soon took to using FILM funds to secretly fund Il Popolo d'Italia, the newspaper of Benito Mussolini (at the time still considered a Socialist Party dissident), and followed the rightwards shift of that group. He soon became a public supporter of Gabriele d'Annunzio and worked to aid his endeavours in the Free State of Fiume. To this end he hijacked a ship, Persia, carrying weapons to the White Russians and diverted them to Fiume. Giulietti criticised other socialists for failing to take advantage of the opportunities offered by d'Annunzio, arguing that even if they did not support him they could have taken advantage of the chaos he created to launch their own revolution.Nicholas Farrell, Mussolini: A New Life, London: Phoenix, 2004, p. 94 Despite this, the two split in 1924 when d'Annunzio, under pressure from industrialist backers who feared Giulletti's socialist background, repudiated their alliance. Despite his declared support for Mussolini, Giulietti found Fascist Italy a difficult prospect and throughout the early 1920s he maintained links to the left as well as the fascists. He was unpopular with the fascists in his home city of Genoa and in November 1926 they had him arrested and sent into 'exile' in Nuoro. During the remainder of the fascist period he continued to be active on behalf of the seamen, although he also garnered a reputation for corruption and misappropriation of funds during this period. He faced no charges after the Second World War despite his early involvement in fascism. After the war Giulietti he continued his activism with FILM and also entered formal politics, being elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies for the Italian Republican Party in the 1948 election. In 1949 he became a member of the confederal executive of the Italian General Confederation of Labour, a position he held until death.

Instituted in 1922, this campaign medal was awarded by the French Government for military service in the interwar period, to those serving on its behalf, since 1918, against de facto powers in The Levant. The Levant Campaign began in January 1920 when the Arab Kingdom of Syria engaged French armed forces in what would become called the Franco-Syrian War. This campaign ended on 24 July 1920, when French troops entered Damascus abolishing the Arab Kingdom of Syria. Turkey took advantage of the situation by also engaging France in what is now called the Franco-Turkish War pitting the French Colonial Forces and French Armenian Legion against the Turkish forces known as the Kuva-yi Milliye. This campaign, running from May 1920 to October 1921 resulted in French partial occupation of Turkish territory. An uneasy peace ensued which was broken on 23 August 1925 when Sultan Pasha al-Atrash declared revolution against France, thus starting the Great Syrian Revolt (also called the Great Druze Revolt), which took several years for the French Government to subdue. Award history The Syria-Cilicia Commemorative Medal was instituted by a decree of 18 July 1922Mus√©e de la L√©gion d'Honneur following a Bill initiated by a French deputy, General de Castelnau, who was also president of the French Military Commission. An almost identical Vichy-sponsored medal was produced during World War II to recognize engagements fought by its forces in the same area from 8 June to 12 July 1941, it was adorned with the clasp \\"LEVANT 1941\\". Most battles were between Vichy forces and Free French Forces, this was and still is a source of national pain for France. Consequently, a law of 12 April 1944 abolished this medal and its right to be worn. Award statute The Syria-Cilicia Commemorative Medal was bestowed upon the Army of the Levant (and Allied naval/air force personnel operating off the coast of Syria-Cilicia, between 11 November 1918 and 20 October 1921); as well as members of the military who took part in the operations carried out between 21 July 1925 and 30 September 1926; to civilian personnel of French nationality, fulfilling the same prerequisites as soldiers or sailors in earning this award. Prior to 1939, a series of decrees allowed for its bestowal after 30 September 1926 under very specific conditions. These awards to both civilian and military personnel on special assignment in Lebanon or Syria were very rare. For conferral after 1926, the medal is worn without a clasp. Award description The Syria-Cilicia Commemorative Medal is 30mm in diameter circular and struck from bronze. The obverse bears the relief image of the \\"La R√©publique\\" in the form of the left profile of a helmeted woman's bust, the helmet being adorned with a crown of oak leaves. On either side, the relief inscription along the circumference \\"R√âPUBLIQUE FRAN√áAISE\\" (\\"French Republic\\"). The reverse, representing both the army and navy, bears the relief images of an infantry rifle crossed with a naval anchor below two military banners and lances surmounted by the relief inscription \\"LEVANT\\". On some variants, the relief inscription \\"HONNEUR ET PATRIE - SYRIE-CILICIE\\" (\\"Honour and Country - Syria Cilicia\\") or only \\"HONNEUR ET PATRIE\\" can be found on one of the banners. In the background, sand dunes, the wall of a Kasbah and palm trees. The medal hangs from a ribbon through a ring passing through the medal's suspension loop. The ring is adorned by a 24 mm in diameter bronze laurel wreath and half crescent. The white silk moir√© ribbon is 37 mm wide with 3 mm high blue horizontal stripes 3 mm equidistant. Two gilt clasps with oriental ornamentation can be worn on the ribbon. The first bearing the inscription \\"LEVANT\\" for participations in the operations between 11 November 1918 and 20 October 1921. The second clasp bearing the relief inscription \\"1925-Levant-1926\\" for operations against the Druze. Both clasps can be earned and displayed simultaneously on the ribbon.

There are between 100 and 300 municipal police forces (therefore only approximately one-in-ten municipalities have their own police). Most of these forces are responsible for general law and order and parking enforcement only. In some larger cities, the municipal police also carry out traffic control and in Zurich, Winterthur and Lausanne they provide a full policing service. Municipal police forces send their recruits to the same regional police academies as the cantons do. For advanced training, the municipalities send their officers to the courses of the Swiss Police Institute. Police Reforms Canton of Aargau : At the beginning of the new millennium, the government formed Aargau regional police forces, in the center of each former city police forces are: Wettingen, Baden, Aarau, Lenzburg and Zofingen. In addition, the new Frick valley. Canton of Bern : A referendum of 11 March 2007 decided the Bernese people, on the first January 2008 to integrate the city police to Bern cantonal police forces. All municipal corps should be united to the year 2011 in the Canton of Bern in Bern Police Unit Police (Police of the Canton of Bern). Canton Grisons : In large-scale, highly compartmentalized Canton municipal autonomy is of high importance and so also within the cantonal police jurisdiction. Grisons City police: Chur (Coire), St. Moritz and Arosa. Canton of Solothurn : Since 2005, the demand employed by a government unit of the police.

Canton of Vaud (Vaud): The Vaud vote for the creation of a police unit of 27 September 2009 failed: The cantonal police within federalism is indeed reorganized, the municipal police powers, however, remain largely intact. The most important corps leads the Lausanne . More Vaud police corps are the City of Yverdon, Montreux Morges...... Canton Wallis (Valais): In dissected mountain canton, there are numerous communal police.

On 9 September 1914, Chiri was conscripted into the 17th Field Artillery Regiment of the Italian Army. On 18 April 1915, he was accepted for pilot's training at Pisa. He was suspended from training early in the course, but kept on hand as a sheet metal mechanic. In November 1915, he resumed pilot's training. On 1 April 1916, he was promoted to corporal. On 8 June 1916, he finally went on flying service with the 77a Squadriglia. After some months service there, he was transferred to 78a Squadriglia on 11 October 1916. He was promoted again, to Sergente, on 31 October. On 19 March 1917, Chiri shot down an Austro-Hungarian Hansa- Brandenburg C.1 over Gallio Bassano for his first aerial victory; the feat earned him a Silver Medal for Military Valor. On 26 August 1917, he shot down his second enemy aircraft, over Loque, and was given his second in the field award of the Silver Medal for Military Valor. Chiri submitted victory claims through 27 October 1918. These claims were shared with several other Italian aces, such as Marziale Cerutti, Gastone Novelli, Mario Fucini, Cosimo Rennella, and Cesare Magistrini. War's end brought a third award in the field of the Silver Medal for Military Valor. Chiri had also won the Croce di Guerra at some point. He had received his final promotion to Sergente MaggioreFranks et al 1997, p. 164. on 15 September 1918. He had flown over 250 combat sorties. Shortly after war's end, on 21 December 1918, Chiri suffered a flying accident that resulted in his being invalided from military service. On 1 February 1919, an evaluation committee from Italy's military intelligence branch released its evaluation of Italy's World War I aerial victories. The report listed six aerial victories by Chiri, but somehow he has subsequently been listed with five.Franks et al 1997, p. 116. Chiri managed to rejoin the military to serve in the Regia Aeronautica reserves. At some point he was raised to the officers' ranks, as he reached the rank of Capitano on 8 June 1942. Antonio Chiri died in Torino, Italy on 6 January 1971. NotesReferences * Franks, Norman; Guest, Russell; Alegi, Gregory.

The MOTW strategic paradigm evolved slowly. Malaya The evolution of British tactics in the Malayan Emergency (1948-1960) illustrates lessons learned the hard way; and eventually, the British developed a strategy with elements similar to \\"military operations other than warfare.\\" principles. In a sense, events in Malaya anticipated the current doctrine. Ultimately, the way in which political and military leaders defined their roles and synchronized their policies and operations produced measurable results.

Synopsis The film follows the White family over the course of a year in their daily life through first-person interviews. The film mentions the details of the death of patriarch Donald Ray \\"D. Ray\\" White, as well as his rise to stardom as one of the most famous mountain dancers of his time. The illness of his widow, Bertie Mae White, is documented throughout the course of the film. Locals consider Bertie Mae \\"The Miracle Woman\\" because of her lifelong dedication to raising abandoned children. Throughout the film, Bertie is seen supporting her family despite her intolerance of their dangerous and reckless behavior. The younger generations of Whites are followed to drug deals, criminal trials, hospital beds, and jail cells to recount the wild and outlandish events in their lives. A group of local professionals in Boone County act as a Greek chorus as they speak about the Whites, mostly criticizing their negative influence on the community. Stemming from generations of coal miners working in risky job conditions, most of the White family possesses a fatalistic attitude and a lack of fear of death. Various members recall violent fights with neighbors, family members, and other locals. Other legal troubles include larceny, prescription fraud, shootings, armed robbery, forgery, stabbings, and child custody battles. D. Ray worked in the coal mines during the scrip payment era; Mamie explains how D. Ray's frustration with his employers' corrupt practices led him to \\"outsmarting the system.\\" D. Ray legally signed each of his children up for \\"crazy checks\\" during their early adolescence. Mamie discloses to the audience that each month, she (and all the other offspring of D. Ray and Bertie Mae) receive social security checks monthly from the government due to their inability to hold employment because of alleged psychiatric disability. The Whites Six of D.

She died during childbirth at the age of 19. Biography Anne Christine Louise was born a Countess Palatine of Sulzbach. She was the daughter of Theodore Eustace, Prince Palatine of Sulzbach (1659‚Äì1732), the head of a Roman Catholic cadet branch of Bavaria's Wittelsbach dynasty, and Princess Eleonore of Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg (1675-1720), daughter of William, Landgrave of Hesse-Rotenburg.

It currently sits at 22 miles. A master plan for the Trail was completed and portions of the trail are finished and open to the public. A community campaign to raise $5.9 million, to be combined with committed government funds, is underway to secure the remaining dollars needed to finish the trail. History The roots of the Kalamazoo River Valley Trail go back to the founding of two partner organizations‚ÄîThe Parks Foundation of Kalamazoo County and The Friends of the Kalamazoo River Valley Trailway. In 1982 a group of citizens wanted to protect parkland at the former Morris Markin estate in northern Kalamazoo County and develop a recreational destination. The group created the Parks Foundation of Kalamazoo County and formed a partnership with the county to develop and protect park lands. Volunteers and donors raised more than $6 million to develop, protect and maintain Markin Glen Park. In 1980 Kalamazoo leaders gathered to develop a plan for enriching the quality of life in the community. From this planning effort, The Kalamazoo Forum was created to tackle large-scale community issues, such as restoring the viability of the Kalamazoo River. Citizens, with assistance from The Forum, envisioned a non-motorized trail that would connect these communities and bring residents closer to the river. The Friends of the Kalamazoo River Valley Trailway was created to focus resources on completing a master plan for the trail. In 1996 a demonstration trail was completed at Mayors' Riverfront Park in Kalamazoo. The City of Kalamazoo added trail sections around downtown. In 2000 Kalamazoo County agreed to manage and operate the proposed trail as a county park. The next phase of the Kalamazoo River Valley Trail was opened in September 2008. This 4.8 mile section runs from 10th Street at the head of the Kal-Haven Trail to Westnedge Avenue. Upcoming trail segments During 2009 the trail segment from Rose Park in Kalamazoo to Mosel avenue was completed. This section includes a 14 ft. wide bridge over the Kalamazoo River at Paterson Street. In 2010, construction began on a 5-mile section from Mosel Avenue to D Avenue. This segment of trail goes through Markin Glen Park and the Kalamazoo Nature Center. Following completion of this section, the county completed a section running from Mayors' Riverfront Park to Sprinkle Avenue (1.7 miles) and from Sprinkle Avenue to 35th Street (5.5 miles) in Galesburg. After that work from 35th Street to Battle Creek (9.5 miles) and from Michigan Avenue to Kilgore Road (4 miles) will be finished. The Kalamazoo River Valley Trail will link Battle Creek to the Kal-Haven Trail from east to west and D Avenue to the City of Portage from north to south.Kalamazoo County Parks Department Funding Kalamazoo County and the Parks Foundation are partners in securing the $18.6 million needed to complete the entire Kalamazoo River Valley Trail. During Phase I of a fund raising campaign, which secured funds for the Kalamazoo to Kal-Haven segment and the Kalamazoo to Parchment segment, $2.8 million was raised in charitable funds from the community. Another $2.4 million was secured in Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) funds and $468,100 from local governments. The Parks Foundation is now raising charitable gifts for Phase II of the campaign to complete all remaining trail sections. The goals for this phase are $5.9 million in charitable contributions from the community, $5.5 million in MDOT investment, and $1.5 million. in local government commitments. These goals include an endowment fund corpus of $2,000,000 for future trail maintenance.Kalamazoo Gazette September 16, 2003Kalamazoo Gazette June 9, 2008Kalamazoo Gazette January 23, 2009 References Category:Protected areas of Kalamazoo County, Michigan Category:Hiking trails in Michigan Category:Bike paths in Michigan Category:Transportation in Kalamazoo County, Michigan ","title":"Kalamazoo River Valley Trail"},{"id":"24517834","text":"Lieutenant Norman Cooper (b.

He was the founding member of the power pop/punk rock groups The Nils (1978‚Äì2004) and Chino (1999). Career Soria formed The Nils when he was only 13. He would listen to punk rock records such as The Clash, Sex Pistols and Stiff Little Fingers. He bought himself an $80 guitar and taught himself three chords. By 1978 The Nils had formed and began playing live. In 1982, The Nils released \\"Scratches and Needles\\" for the BYO compilation Something to Believe In, and \\"Call of the Wild\\" for the Primitive Air Raid compilation. The band began to tour extensively and still managed to deliver a power pop/punk rock EP entitled Paisley in 1984. By 1985, The Nils had befriended Ivan Doroschuk of Men Without Hats who loaned the band $3,500 to record the Sell Out Young EP. The album's success drew the attention of a few major labels and by the following year, The Nils accepted an offer from a subsidiary of Profile Records to record the self-titled LP The Nils (produced by Chris Spedding and award-winning engineer Phil Burnett). This album included updated versions of the songs \\"Daylight\\" and \\"Inbetweens\\" from Sell Out Young, as well as eight other original songs. With this the band continued to get critical acclaim and set off on a second North American tour before it was being abruptly cancelled due to the label's bankruptcy. Bound by their five-year contract with the now defunct label and unable to release anything under The Nils name until the contract's expiration, the band broke up and went their separate ways. Alex's brother Carlos robbed the band of its remaining money and ran away to Los Angeles, leaving Alex to begin a day job in Montreal. In 1994 Mag Wheel Records released Green Fields in Daylight, a compilation of all their recordings. Later, Soria formed the band Chino in an effort to break away from The Nils and start anew. The band released the six- song EP Mala Leche in 1999 and continued to play shows but never got as much public attention as The Nils. In 2002, The Nils reformed with Carlos now on bass, and ex Flounger and Chino guitar player and close friend of Alex, Mark Donato. The band began writing new songs and Soria finally seemed hopeful that this could be their second chance. On December 13, 2004, in a moment of desperation, Alex Soria ended his life on a train track near his home in Montreal. He was 39 years old. Months later, musicians including Chris Spedding and John Kastner (Doughboys, Asexuals) held a sold out tribute concert in his name. In 2006 Paul, the owner of a Montreal record shop, released the album Next Of Kin, featuring unreleased acoustic four-track recordings by Alex.

The pilot and instructor sat in tandem, with the student forward of the wings and the instructor immediately aft of the mainspar in the wing centre-section. The seating arrangement allowed the aircraft to be flown with one or two pilots without the need for ballast to adjust the centre of gravity.

Plot It is the year 2267. After the earth has become uninhabitable due to an ecological collapse, the remaining people live on overcrowded space stations in Earth's orbit. The young doctor Laura Portmann (Anna Katharina Schwabroh) is one of them. She hopes for a better future alongside her sister on the distant planet Rhea (unrelated to Saturn's moon Rhea). As she needs money to fund the journey, she signs up with Kuiper Enterprises for a job on the decrepit cargo ship Kassandra, heading for an eight-year flight to unmanned Station #42 and back. The crew consists of five members: Captain Lacroix (Pierre Semmler), Lindbergh (Regula Grauwiller), Yoshida (Yangzom Brauen), Prokoff (Claude-Oliver Rudolph), and Vespucci (Michael Finger). Crew members spend most of the fully automated flight in deep cryosleep while one person stays awake in 8¬Ω month shifts to monitor the ship. Due to the current terrorist threat from the radical Neo-Luddite group ' (\\"Machine Strikers\\"), there is also an additional security guard aboard: Samuel Decker (Martin Rapold). Toward the end of her shift, Portmann hears unusual noises from the cargo bay, and feels as though she is being observed. Her colleagues are awakened, and together the crew sets out to investigate the cold cargo space. The crew discover a young girl in suspended animation inside a cargo container that was supposed to contain construction materials. Inspecting the girl's body, Portmann finds a \\"perfected\\" virtual reality connector embedded in the girl's spine. Later, Portmann sends an account of her finding to her sister on Rhea, and receives a reply in 20 minutes, rather than the usual matter of years. Portmann begins to wonder where the spaceship is really going and what cargo is actually being transported. It eventually emerges that Rhea is actually a virtual reality simulation designed to keep the remaining humans hopeful about their future; the people in the cargo hold are going to be wired into a large mainframe, which is the ship's true destination. Upon discovering this, the crew decide to put an end to the deception. Upon arriving at their destination and while the ship automatically unloads its cargo, Portman enters the simulation to broadcast a \\"final transmission from Rhea\\", which reveals the simulated nature of the planet to the remaining humans, while Decker sabotages the mainframe's antenna.

He later claimed that he faked the symptoms so he could be allowed to leave the agency. Defection In 1963, Hamilton defected to the Soviet Union. In July, Izvestia published an account by Hamilton of his work at the NSA. Mental illness and later life Hamilton was confined for schizophrenia in the USSR, initially at a Kremlin hospital for high officials. In 1971, he was transferred to Special Psychiatric Hospital No. 5 in Troitskoye, about 30 miles south of Moscow. He was rediscovered there in 1992 by the Ark Project, which sought US POW's who might be in Soviet hands once the USSR fell. Hamilton was convinced that the Pentagon was communicating with him through the radio, then later through his television set. When they learned of his whereabouts in 1992 his wife and children, surprised to learn he was still alive, stated that they would seek his repatriation.

It became bankrupt in 1832 and its name was then adopted by another Carmarthenshire-based bank. History This bank was established in Carmarthen by the partnership known as Waters, Jones & Co., and probably developed from one or more earlier banks operated under the name of Waters and variously referred to in the London Directory, for the years 1811‚Äì1816, as Waters; Waters & Co.; R. & R. Waters; and Thomas Waters & Sons.Early Banks in West Wales, by Francis Green (in West Wales Historical Records, The Annual Magazine of The Historical Society of West Wales, Volume VI, edited by Francis Green, Printed by W. Spurrell & Son, 1916) During the Panic of 1825, the Bank of England suspended cash payments due to frequent provincial bank failures, leading to a general run on British banks in December 1825. In December, 1825 public meetings were held at the Guildhall, Carmarthen and at Llandeilo, where votes of public confidence were passed in Waters, Jones & Co. and David Morris & Sons. Both enterprises survived the 1825 crisis but, on 19 January 1832, Waters, Jones & Co. suspended all payments. The partners in Carmarthen Bank at this time were John Waters, Arthur Jones and David Jones, all of Carmarthen. Attempts were made to avoid bankruptcy, and on 7 February 1832, an agreementCarmarthenshire Antiquarian Society archives was drawn up which recited that the accounts had been inspected on 21 January 1832, and that assets were sufficient to meet liabilities. Under this agreement, Waters, Jones & Co. would meet all the assets of Carmarthen Bank under the supervision of inspectors, who were to receive the proceeds of realisation of the assets on trust for the bank‚Äôs creditors. This agreement contained a proviso that if the partners of Sir James Esdaile & Co., bankers of Lombard Street, London, and certain other creditors holding nine-tenths of the value of the bank‚Äôs debts, did not execute the agreement before 1 May 1832, the agreement would be void and a commission of bankruptcy would be issued against Waters, Jones & Co. Although the partners in the bank, and some of the creditors, signed the agreement, the partners of Sir James Esdaile & Co., who were owed a large amount, did not. A fiat of bankruptcy was issued, and the notes exhibited at the Ivy Bush Hotel, Carmarthen on 11 September 1832, when a first dividend of 5 shillings in the pound was paid. According to one authority,Anon., British Losses by Bank Failures, 1858 the liabilities of Waters, Jones & Co. amounted to ¬£300,000, and the failure of the bank was the result of ‚Äòissuing notes to the extent of nearly ¬£100,000 upon unmarketable securities, and making advances in opposition to every principle of common sense and common safety. Money was freely lent, without security, to drovers to enable them to purchase cattle, and the wants of a large agricultural district were soothed in a similarly paternal manner.‚Äô It may be that such harsh criticism was due to the writer being a heavy depositor in the bank. Successor in name It was probably after the failure of Carmarthen Bank that David Morris adopted the name, and changed the name of his bank from David Morris & Sons to Carmarthen Bank. David Morris & Sons had been formed from the amalgamation of Morris & Sons, which he had established in Carmarthen, in 1791, and Carmarthen Furnace Bank, which had been established by John Morgan of Furnace House, Carmarthen. Bank notes The earliest known bank note for this bank is for ¬£2 and is dated 10 October 1825. Existing specimens of bank notes issued by the bank are for ¬£1, ¬£2, ¬£5, ¬£8, and ¬£50. So far as is known, it is the only bank in England and Wales that issued a bank note for ¬£8 Other Carmarthenshire banks Other Carmarthenshire banks include: Carmarthen Furnace Bank, Llandovery Bank, Llanelly Bank, and David Morris & Sons.

It is an irregularly shaped area in size, extending almost to Saratoga Race Course from the neighborhood of Congress Park. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, it was where the city's well-to-do residents built their homes, when the city was one of the country's top resorts, frequented by many of the wealthiest families of the era. Later on it was home to the earliest incarnations of Skidmore College. In 1982 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Geography East Side is one of five historic districts, all contiguous, in the city. It is bordered by Union Avenue on the south, Congress Park to the west and Broadway on the northwest. Boundary The district's irregular boundary follows primarily lot lines and streets. It begins in the north at the intersection of Circular and North streets, including the properties on both sides of Circular at that point. From there it goes east along North to East Harrison Street, where it turns south. Houses on York Avenue all the way east to Nelson Avenue are included, then it follows the rear lot line of houses on the west side of East Harrison south of that intersection (excluding the entire block at Middle Avenue). It then returns to East Harrison along Swanner Lane and follows the back lines along some of the houses along Lake Avenue (NY 29) Opposite Marion Place, it goes out to Lake and follows it east to the middle of the block between Marion and Nelson Avenue. There, it turns south between two properties to eventually follow Diamond Place. It takes in the house at the corner of Diamond Place and Diamond Street, then follows the latter west to the line between two lots and goes south to Mitchell Place. It follows Mitchell out to Nelson and then turns south briefly to continue east along the rear lot lines of the north side of Caroline Street to include three lots east of Ludlow Street. From there it continues south to the middle of the block, including all properties on Labelle Lane. It follows rear lot lines again along Fifth Avenue to East Avenue, which it follows south to the rear lot line of the properties on the south side of Fifth, excluding the stables and other track support buildings. This point is the district's eastern extreme. The boundary continues to divide houses and racetrack buildings down to George Street, where it turns west. Other than including the house at 60 George, on the southwest corner of the Nelson Avenue intersection, it remains in George Street all the way to Court Street. There it dips southward again and follows Thompson Place to Regent Street. It goes to its southernmost point when it includes all properties along the west side of Regent down to Union Avenue (NY 9P), then follows their rear lines north to Spring Street, where it turns west again. It turns north around a property at the northeast corner of Spring and Henry Street, then goes west to follow Henry up to Caroline. There it goes east to the middle of the block and then follows lot lines to Lake. After following the rear lines of two properties next to the armory on Henry at the northeast corner of Lake, it includes one more house on Henry and then follows a driveway to Bank Alley, where it turns west to Henry again. It follows Henry, then the rear line along the east of the street until it reaches that of the house opposite North Street, where it turns east. Character The district's terrain is mostly level, most of it east of the rise from the small fault where the city's springs are located. It is extensively developed, with streets and narrower connecting alleys laid out in a grid plan. There are 379 buildings within the district, many of them houses in an array of 19th and early 20th century styles, from Gothic Revival to Bungalow. They are predominantly faced in clapboard or brick. Only 15 of them are of modern construction, including one supermarket building, and thus not considered contributing properties to the district's historic character. A few institutional buildings remain from Skidmore College's use of the area prior to 1976, especially its former art school near the west boundary. The state armory on Lake Avenue, one of many designed by Isaac Perry, is also included, as well as a church, fire station and local elementary school. 1870s rowhouses on Regent Street History As Saratoga Springs began to develop into one of the country's most fashionable resorts in the late 19th century, it developed its own upper and upper-middle class. These people, primarily the owners of stores and spas and those who owned the firms that designed and built them, wanted to live in houses that reflected their success. They gravitated to the neighborhoods east of upper Broadway and north of Union Avenue, where the wealthy summer residents had their homes. Their own homes were scaled-down versions of those homes, often by the same architects, including R. Newton Brezee, who himself lived on the East Side. In 1902 Lucy Skidmore Scribner founded the Young Women's Industrial Club. It became Skidmore School of the Arts a decade later, in 1911, and finally Skidmore College in 1922. The Regent Street Theatre was the first building constructed specifically for the college. By 1931 the campus dominated the western portion of the district, with 82 buildings either built or renovated for it over . In 1976 it moved to a new campus in the city's north, and left most of its original buildings. Currently its historic character is preserved by the city's Design Review Commission, a seven-member body appointed by the mayor to staggered three-year terms. It reviews any proposed signage and exterior changes to any building in any of the city's historic districts. Significant contributing properties None of the properties in the district are currently listed on the National Register in their own right. Some are notable within it. *R. Newton Brezee House, 119 Caroline Street. This Clapboard Queen Anne designed as his own residence by the architect of many homes in the city, including several others in the district, and built in 1892. *New York State Armory, 60 Lake Avenue.

Some predatory fish include perch, muskie, pike, walleye and salmon. Levels of large predatory fish in the global oceans were estimated to be about 10% of their pre-industrial levels by 2003. Large predatory fish are most at risk of extinction; there was a disproportionate level of large predatory fish extinctions during the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. Creation of marine reserves has been found to restore populations of large predatory fish such as the Serranidae -- groupers and sea bass. Predatory fish switch between types of prey in response to variations in their abundance. Such changes in preference are disproportionate and are selected for as evolutionarily efficient. Predatory fish may become a pest if they are introduced into an ecosystem in which they become a new top predator. An example, which has caused much trouble in Maryland and Florida, is the snakehead fish. Predatory fish such as sharks, mahi-mahi, billfish, and tuna form a part of the human diet, but they tend to concentrate significant quantities of mercury in their bodies if they are high in the food chain, especially as apex predators, due to biomagnification. Predators are an important factor to consider in managing fisheries, and methods for doing so are available and used in some places.

Compositions include two sonatas, several concert solos and smaller violin works as well as important contributions to the literature of music.Bachmann, Alberto, An Encyclopedia of the Violin, (Da Capo Press, London 1925) The second husband of Paul's aunt, Maria Malibran, was the great Belgian violinist Charles de B√©riot, who remained close to the Viardots and took an interest in the boy, though Paul actually studied with his successor at the Brussels Conservatoire Hubert L√©onard (also related by marriage to the Garcia clan). Though Carl Flesch dismisses Paul Viardot as a salon player, he was clearly more than that, as he toured widely. Faur√© dedicated his A major sonata of 1875/6 to him.

In 1921 he was graduated from Cornell University, where he had studied mechanical engineering, and where he had joined Kappa Sigma fraternity like his father. Olin was very active in the Republican Party throughout much of his adult life. He was an important fundraiser for Dwight D.

Outside of his professional and political life, he won a pro-am golf tournament with Arnold Palmer at The Greenbrier in 1954, beginning a forty-year friendship. The win helped launch Palmer's career. Later, when Olin donated $5 million to build a public golf course in Alton, Palmer agreed to design it. He was a significant donor to the Washington University School of Medicine, whose first residence hall is named after him, its construction anchored by a $500,000 gift, and also home to the Ann Whitney Olin Women's Building, named after his wife. At least seven professorships, fellowships, and scholarships and the university were funded through the Spencer T. & Ann W. Olin Foundation, which was established in 1958. The foundation also funded a variety of environmental groups, health and medical education and services, education, and arts groups in the St. Louis area and around the United States until it ceased operations in 2004.

The sons of the two families play harmless tricks on each other but soon the Feather boys decide to kidnap a girl, escalating the rivalry. She turns out to be innocent bystander Roonie Gill (Season Hubley), not the made-up Gutshall girlfriend \\"Lolly Madonna\\" that the Gutshall clan had invented to get the Feathers away from their still. As events escalate, Zack Feather (Jeff Bridges) and Roonie fall in love and try to bring the others to their senses, but to no avail. One family busts up another's still; and in retaliation, the sons of that family assault the daughter of the other. After the feud results in a fiery confrontation in a meadow, where one of the Feather boys is fatally wounded and the mother of the Gutshall kin is shot to death, the two families regroup in order to gear up for a final deadly confrontation.

Biography A graduate of the University of Glasgow (Honours MA in Medieval and Modern History), he has been a columnist and social diarist (i.e. society editor) for The Sunday Times, a columnist and editorial (i.e. leader) writer for Scotland on Sunday, and a leader writer for the Scottish Daily Mail. Although his legal name in the United Kingdom is \\"James Gerald Warner of Craigenmaddie\\", he does not appear to use this formal style in his journalistic writing, preferring \\"Gerald Warner\\". During the 1990s Conservative government of Prime Minister John Major, he left journalism to become Special Adviser to the Secretary of State for Scotland, the British cabinet minister responsible for Scottish affairs. He had previously been, in 1974, an unsuccessful Parliamentary candidate. He is the author of seven books, primarily on specialised historical subjects, curiosities, and folklore. His official history of the Scottish Conservative Party included a foreword by Margaret Thatcher. He has spoken of his book Secret Places, Hidden Sanctuaries (written with co-author Stephen Klimczuk) as a \\"robust and sceptical look at the kind of esoteric nonsense celebrated in The Da Vinci Code.\\" It covers various sites and societies favoured by conspiracy theorists and unexplained mystery enthusiasts, including Rosslyn Chapel, Area 51, Skull and Bones, Opus Dei, the Esalen Institute, Mount Weather, Heinrich Himmler's Wewelsburg Castle, Montecristo island, and Disneyland's Club 33. He is a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, and undertook three years of postgraduate research in Irish history after his university degree. He has written about being part of that \\"dwindling band of individualists who persist in defying the zeitgeist\\" by wearing a monocle. In 2014 it was announced by press release that Gerald Warner would be writing for www.traditionalright.com. In a second press release it was announced that Warner was currently writing a satirical parody of Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead, to be published under an open source licence. Anti-Cameronism As a social conservative, Warner is a staunch opponent of David Cameron, former leader of the British Conservative Party and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He argues that Cameron and other Tory \\"modernisers\\" have antagonised British social conservatives, especially through their pragmatic acceptance of LGBT rights as a fait accompli, given the reforms of the Brown and Blair administrations. After the advent of a hung parliament as a result of that election, he continued to do so after the resultant formation of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition and advent of David Cameron's premiership. He was billed to address the Annual Conference of the Traditional Britain Group in October 2014, but backed out at the last moment without any explanation.

Croneberger attended Lehigh University where he earned a bachelor's degree in classical languages in 1958. In 1961, he earned a master's degree in the same major from University of Pennsylvania. Within a year, Croneberger decided to shift gears and earned a master's degree in library science from Drexel Institute of Technology in 1962. Upon graduation, Croneberger went to work at the Library of Congress until 1968 where he served in various roles including executive assistant, assistant chief of the Card Division and assistant chief of the Serial Record Division.Rodger, Joey (2003). ‚ÄúCroneberger, Robert B.‚Äù.

Work=Detroit Public Library years During his time at the Detroit Public Library, Croneberger wrote of three experiments the library was conducting in the realm of information services. One experiment represented a traditional approach where librarians at the main branch of the library system contacted local organizations and maintained pertinent information in a card file. For the second one, the library collaborated with the city government. Calling it a ‚Äúlittle city hall‚Äù, the library would offer some of the services provided by city government on a neighborhood level. The third and final experiment centered on a concept known as a community knowledge center. The idea relied on the collaboration of the library community agencies and graduate sociology students. Students would study the community and provide the library with their findings.Croneberger, Robert (24 October 1971). ‚ÄúKnowledge Is Power: The Detroit Public Library.‚Äù Libraries and Neighborhood Centers; Papers Presented at an Institute Conducted by University of Illinois Graduate School of Library Science, Urbana, IL, pp. 125-128. The experiments laid the foundation for the creation of The Information Place, the library's information and referral service that still exists today. Croneberger's work led to him being considered one of the founders of the information and referral ‚Äúmovement.‚Äù He eventually went on to become chairman of the Information and Referral Taskforce of the National Commission on Library and Information Science.Rodger, Joey.

The Memphis years Croneberger arrived at Memphis and Shelby County Library system in 1975, a year before the city passed an ordinance that banned destroying or damaging library books. In 1980, Croneberger was the director when the first person was arrested for violating the ordinance. Lily Prymus was arrested in October 1980 after she didn't show up in court in response to a summons. She was charged with not returning 13 books.‚ÄúArrest of Library Patron Nets Bonanza of Overdue Books ‚Äù (5 February 1981). Associated Press. The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh years In 1986, Croneberger began his 11-year stint as the eighth director of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. He brought his passion for the community and information and referral services with him by forming a partnership with the United Way of Allegheny County. Another partnership was formed with the Pittsburgh Mediation Center, which focused on conflict resolution. Public housing projects also became the recipients of library services under his reign.Rodger, Joey. (2003) ‚ÄúCroneberger, Robert B.‚Äù. Dictionary of American Library Biography. Westport, CT: Libraries Unlimited, pp.58-60. While at Carnegie, Croneberger also played a critical role in the fundraising and development efforts leading to the creation of the Electronic Information Network.

In his testimony, Croneberger informed the three-judge panel that adhering to the recently passed law would require an extensive amount of manpower and labor to scour his library's entire collection. Furthermore, Croneberger demonstrated to the court how various research topics such as gardening would be affected if all references to sex were removed from the library.Ivey, Dave (23 March 1996). ‚ÄúJudges Continue to Examine Issues of Cyberspace Censorship‚Äù.

The submarine earthquake occurred in an extensional environment and had a moment magnitude of 8.1 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VI (Strong). It was the largest earthquake of 2009. A tsunami was generated which caused substantial damage and loss of life in Samoa, American Samoa, and Tonga. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center recorded a rise in sea levels near the epicenter, and New Zealand scientists determined that the waves measured at their highest on the Samoan coast. The quake occurred on the outer rise of the Kermadec-Tonga subduction zone. This is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, where tectonic plates in the Earth's lithosphere meet and earthquakes and volcanic activity are common. Countries affected by the tsunami in the areas that were hit are American Samoa, Samoa and Tonga (Niuatoputapu) where more than 189 people were killed, especially children, most of them in Samoa. Large waves with no major damage were reported on the coasts of Fiji, the northern coast of New Zealand and Rarotonga in the Cook Islands. People took precautions in the low-lying atolls of Tokelau and moved to higher ground. Niue was reported as reasonably safe because it is high. There were no reports of high waves from Vanuatu, Kiribati, New Caledonia and the Solomon Islands. American Samoa Crews working near the damage from the tsunami in American Samoa The Los Angeles Times, quoting a source at the National Park of American Samoa, reported that \\"four tsunami waves, 15 to 20 ft (4.6 to 6 m) high\\", and \\"reaching up to a mile (1.6 km) inland\\" hit American Samoa shortly after the earthquake. The water flowed inland about 100 yd (100 m) before receding, leaving some cars stuck in the mud. Damage to the National Park's natural reserves and the destruction of its visitor center and main offices have been reported, while only 20% of the park's 40 to 50 employees and volunteers had been found. A beach village was reported to have been \\"wiped out\\", killing at least 14 people after the earthquake had sent residents fleeing for higher ground. Large numbers of American Samoans were said to have been left injured or homeless. Confirmed death tolls rose to 22 people, with many people still missing in the villages of Leone and Pago Pago. A Radio New Zealand International correspondent reported that the center of Pago Pago, the largest city in American Samoa, had sustained heavy damage in the tsunami, with its main street flooded, cars overturned, and shoreline businesses damaged. He \\"also witnessed looting in one of the stores\\". American Samoa Governor Togiola Tulafono was in Honolulu, Hawaii for an ocean policy conference at the time of the tsunami struck. Tulafono was monitoring events in American Samoa, but was having difficulties reaching the territory because of communications failures. He told reporters that because of the tight knit communities and strong family bonds, \\"I don't think anybody is going to be spared this disaster.\\" Tulafono departed Hawaii for American Samoa on a United States Coast Guard supply flight from Honolulu on the evening of 29 September. Security camera footage of the tsunami surging through a parking lot in Pago Pago. Lieutenant Governor Ipulasi Aitofele Sunia announced that the earthquake had caused severe damage to American Samoa's electrical infrastructure. The main electricity generator in Satala had been damaged, which knocked out power from the central village of Faga'alu across Tutuila to the eastern village of Onenoa. The Satala electrical plant may be out of service for a month or more until repairs can be made, with the American Samoa Power Authority (ASPA) stating that power will be out indefinitely. A new power plant at Satala is expected to be commissioned on 25 May 2017.http://www.talanei.com/2017/04/07/commissioaing- date-for-satala-power-plant-may-25th/ Electricity was also out on the islands of Ofu-Olosega, in the Manu'a Islands Group, and a government plane has been sent to assess damage on Ofu. The water system was also damaged in the earthquake, and the supply of fresh water to eastern parts of American Samoa has been disrupted due to broken water lines. The water division of the American Samoa Power Authority (ASPA) announced that it will bring water in tanker trucks to affected villages. Residents were warned to conserve and boil water until safe drinking water supplies can be restored, which could take some time. U.S. President Barack Obama declared a major disaster for its dependent territory, American Samoa, allowing federal funds to be used for rescues, life support, and public health and safety measures. Among the initial U.S. government response is a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) logistics team and staff from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Coast Guard, Federal Aviation Administration, and Department of Defense. Also, basic needs and basic commodities, including electrical generators, medical supplies, and pharmaceutical drugs were sent out, and multiple planes are being prepared for more cargo and personnel, including FEMA, HHS, and Coast Guard staff and experts from the Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and Red Cross. The was en route to American Samoa and was the first U.S. military asset to arrive and assist in the recovery efforts. Samoa Samoa evacuated people from the entire city of Apia, the country's capital city on the island of Upolu and moving thousands of residents to higher ground. Journalist Cherelle Jackson reported that the city quickly emptied in the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami, \\"All the schools, workplaces everyone has walked up ‚Äì it's like a ghost town.\\" Twenty villages on Upolu south side were reportedly destroyed, including Lepa, the home of Samoa's Prime Minister Tuilaepa Lupesoliai Sailele Malielegaoi. In Lepa, only the church and the village's welcome sign remained standing following the tsunami. The hardest hit areas in Samoa appear to be Fagaloa Bay on the east coast of Upolu, Lalomanu on the south east coast, and along the rest of the southern coast of the island, with one hospital in Apia reporting it had received 79 bodies. The village of Poutasi on the south west coast of Upolu was reported with extensive damage in a TVNZ news item, along with its neighbouring Villages of Satalo and Salani being completely wiped out. A mother at the Taufua Beach Fales in Lalomanu watched her three young children swept away by the tsunami. Elsewhere there were reports of landslides near Solosolo and damage to plantations near Apia. A number of tourist resorts are located on Upolu's south coast. These include Coconuts Beach Resort and Sinalei Reef Resort and Spa in the village of Siumu. Both resorts published tsunami updates on their websites. The Sa'Moana Resort is in the village of Salamumu. The eastern part of the island remains without power or water supplies after the earthquake.

Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi, and his Deputy Prime Minister Misa Telefoni Retzlaff were in Auckland, New Zealand, at the time of the earthquake. Both political leaders immediately returned to Samoa. Prime Minister Malielegaoi lost two relatives in the tsunami, including the daughter of one of his nieces. The Prime Minister made his first address to the nation, after the tsunami, on 1 October. The Government of Samoa estimates the damage at US$147.25 million. On 2 October 2009, an estimated 3000 people were homeless and seeking refuge in shelters set up around the worst-affected villages. New Zealand's Minister of Foreign Affairs Murray McCully visited Apia to co-ordinate New Zealand's emergency relief effort. New Zealand Prime Minister John Key arrived in Samoa on 3 October and visited some of the most damaged areas on Upolu including the villages of Poutasi and Lalolamu.

The main impact in Tonga was in the northern part of the island kingdom where there were deaths, injuries and extensive damage on Niuatoputapu, a flat coral island 500 km north of the main island Tongatapu, and reportedly closest to the epicentre of the earthquake. The death toll on the island has risen to nine. A Tongan government spokesman Alfred Soakai said 90% of homes had been destroyed as well as serious damage to the hospital. An adviser to the prime minister, Lopeti Senituli, later said the amount of damage to buildings has been downgraded to 60%. There are three main villages on Niuatoputapu: Hihifo and Falehau, which were hit by three waves, some 6m high, and the village of Vaipoa, which received less damage. A new school building remained standing and provided some shelter. The island is isolated with a population of around 1,000 people. Approximately 192 families were left homeless and the homes of 143 additional families were damaged in the tsunami in the villages of Hihifo, Falehau and Vaipoa. 289 families lived in residences which escaped damage in the disaster. Other reports outlined coastal damage from a wave on the islands. Other media had earlier reported 10 people killed in Tonga. Three people are missing and four sustained serious injuries. Earlier, a government plane sent to the island could not land due to tsunami damage at Niuatoputapu Airport, which had been forced to close. Tonga's acting Prime Minister Lord Tuita said the government is sending a second plane to Niuatoputapu, but that communication links have been damaged. The government appealed for clothing and bedding donations for residents in Niuatoputapu. Relief efforts undertaken by the Tongan government and Red Cross focused on Niuatoputapu, with support from Australia, New Zealand and France. A United Nations coordinator was scheduled to travel to Tonga to support early recovery initiatives in areas such as 'health, sanitation, water, infrastructure, psychological support, agriculture and fishing'. There were no reports of any damage to Vava ªu island group or to the main island of Tongatapu, where the capital, Nuku ªalofa, is. French Polynesia French Polynesia escaped much of the damage inflicted against other Polynesian countries and territories by the earthquake. Concern centered on the Marquesas Islands, the northernmost archipelago in French Polynesia. Unlike the other islands of French Polynesia, the Marquesas have no protective coral reefs which would absorb the impact of a potential tsunami. French High Commissioner Adolphe Colrat warned residents of the Marquesas to seek shelter at an elevation of at least above sea level. Residents across French Polynesia were advised to avoid valleys and bays, tie up watercraft and listen to R√©seau France Outre-mer (RFO) for further instruction. In the Marquesas Islands, some bays were nearly emptied of their water before a wave crashed back in and refilled the area. Boats in the region immediately left port once the warning was issued. The cargo and passenger ship Aranui 3, which had been docked in Taiohae Bay on Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas, the area most impacted by a small tsunami wave, immediately evacuated the bay for open water. Outside of the Marquesas, the threat of a tsunami largely passed without much incidence. The government had initially feared a wave of approximately , with the ability to strike all parts of the sprawling territory. Five small tsunami waves, measuring were recorded off the coast of Papeete, Tahiti, between 11:10 am and 12 noon local time on Tuesday. The first tsunami wave at 11:10 am measured , while the second recorded wave was measured at at 11:23 am The waves gradually increased in size, with the fifth, and last wave, being recorded at tall at 12:03 pm. The Colombian Navy training ship Gloria, also left Papeete Harbor in Tahiti once the warning was issued as a precaution. Residents of the Society Islands, which include the tourist resort areas of Tahiti and Moorea, were advised to move above above sea level, for safety. High Commissioner Adolphe Colrat cancelled the tsunami red alert at 12:03 pm on Tuesday for all areas of French Polynesia except the Marquesas. The alert for the Marquesas Islands was extended 2:50 pm until the threat had passed. French Polynesian President Oscar Temaru wrote to the heads of American Samoa, Samoa and Tonga offering support following the tsunami, \\"On behalf of the people and the government of French Polynesia, I would like to convey our most sincere expression of condolence and solidarity in the wake of the Tsunami that just hit your people...We have, within the FRANZ framework decided to send both human and material help. 1 doctor, 2 nurses and one logistics expert, all members of our emergency medical staff will carry a total of 600 kg [sic] of medical material that will be dispatched locally by the FRANZ authorities.\\" FRANZ stands for France, Australia and New Zealand, three large countries who traditionally provide aid in Oceania following natural disasters.

Tsunami warnings Tsunami travel times from epicentre (in hrs) A tsunami warning was initially issued for American Samoa, Samoa, Niue, Wallis and Futuna, Tokelau, the Cook Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Kiribati, the Kermadec Islands, Fiji, Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, New Zealand, French Polynesia, Palmyra Island, Vanuatu, Nauru, Marshall Islands, and Solomon Islands. Most of the warnings were called off once it was clear that the tsunami threat had passed. Officials in the Cook Islands, which hosted the 2009 Pacific Mini Games, noted that the tsunami passed without any damage to the country. A tsunami warning remained in effect for the Marquesas Islands of French Polynesia, as five main waves were expected to strike that archipelago. Warnings also remained in Tuvalu, one of the lowest lying countries in the world. Local radio stations in Tonga broadcast warnings that a tsunami was possible and that people should move away from coastal villages. A tsunami watch was issued for islands farther from the epicenter, including Hawaii and Papua New Guinea, but not for California, USA. Officials were determining whether the tsunami could reach Hawaii, the center said. It was possible that a strongly decreased wave could reach Hawaii. A tsunami advisory was issued for coastal California and the San Francisco Bay Area beginning at 9:00 pm local time as a precaution. Aftershocks There were more than 40 total aftershocks with a magnitude greater than 5.0 in the 48 hours after the mainshock. Shocks with magnitude 6.0 or higher are highlighted in light blue.

The United States Treasury reported he took over leadership of the organization in 2003, following the death of its previous leader, and took a seat on al Qaeda's shura, its central committee, in 2005. History He was born 10 October 1971 in Hotan Prefecture, Xinjiang. The ETIP was designated as a terrorist organization in Executive Order 13224. The United Nations Security Council's 1267 Committee placed him on a list of individuals suspected of having ties to Osama bin Laden. In October 2008 Chinese security officials asserted that his real name was \\"Memetiming Memeti\\" (Uyghur: ŸÖ€á⁄æ€ïŸÖŸÖ€ïÿ™ÿ¶ŸâŸÖŸâŸÜ ŸÖ€ïŸÖ€ïÿ™ Memtimin Memet). They published half a dozen aliases. They reported he left China in March 1998, and became a trainer at a camp in a \\"South Asian country\\" Al- Qaeda's leadership council included TIP member Abdul Haq al Turkistani, and the organization appointed TIP member Abdul Shakoor Turkistani as military commander of its forces in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan. Uyghur detainees at Guantanamo bay have confessed that they were trained by Abdul Haq and Hassan Mahsum in Afghanistan. Haq threatened terrorist attacks on the 2008 Beijing Olympics. al-Qaeda's command viewed Abdul Haq as authoritative and sent him to meet with Taliban factions along with al-Qaeda commanders. As clarified by TIP head Abdul Haq, the Turkistan Islamic Party is allied to Al-Qaeda. Abdul Haq faced allegations that he was behind a bombing that preceded the Beijing Olympics. TIP's \\"Islamic Turkistan\\" magazine in its 2nd edition and 3rd edition contained an interview with Abdul Haq. Shirley Kan, of the US Congressional Research Service, challenged the Treasury's description of Abdul Haq's role, in several details, in her testimony before the House International Relations Committee's Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight. Kan asserted that the decision to designate the East Turkestan Islamic Party as a terrorist organization was controversial within the civil service. She called the first Chinese list of terrorist organizations, published in December 2003, as \\"intentionally misleading or mistaken\\", and pointed out several errors in it. She noted that it listed Hassan Mahsum as a wanted man, when he was already known to have been killed in action; that Abdul Haq was not listed as a wanted man; that while the Treasury document asserted Abdul Haq had directed followers to launch attacks prior to the Olympics no such attacks on the Olympics took place. (China Daily reported on 21 October 2008 that \\"The Chinese police timely frustrated those criminal activities\\".)Police: Eastern Turkistan terrorists wanted Kan also wrote a document entitled: \\"U.S.-China Counterterrorism Cooperation: Issues for U.S. Policy\\". On 6 May 2009, United States Senator Jeff Sessions published a letter he wrote to United States Attorney General Eric Holder, criticizing Holder for taking steps that could end up with setting the remaining Uyghur captives in Guantanamo free in the United States. According to Sessions: The following excerpt is from the Long War Journal: Haq is considered influential enough in al Qaeda's leadership circles that he is dispatched to mediate between rival Taliban groups as well as to represent the Shura Majlis in important military matters. In June 2009, Haq was spotted in Pakistan's tribal areas attending an important meeting with Baitullah Mehsud, Pakistan's overall Taliban commander who was killed in a US airstrike two months later. Haq and a senior delegation of Taliban and al Qaeda leaders traveled to Pakistan's tribal areas to discuss the Pakistani military's operation in South Waziristan. Among those in attendance were Siraj Haqqani, the military commander of the deadly Haqqani Network; and Abu Yahya al Libi, a senior al Qaeda ideologue and propagandist. The Treasury Department said Haq has sent operatives abroad to raise funds for attacks against Chinese interests both at home and abroad. He also is involved in the planning and execution of terror attacks, recruiting, and propaganda efforts. In early 2008, Haq openly threatened to conduct attacks at the Olympic Games in Beijing. Haq ran a training camp for his recruits at al Qaeda's camp in Tora Bora in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province prior to the US invasion in October 2001 [see LWJ report, \\"The Uighurs in their own words\\"]. He later reestablished camps for the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Party in Pakistan's lawless, Taliban-controlled tribal areas. Although the Chinese government has pressured Pakistan to dismantle the camps, they are said to be still in operation. Abdul Haq assembled with an Amir of Iraqi origin, Hadi al Iraqi. Abdul Haq in 2006 arranged for a relocation to South Asia for Abdushukur. There was a Herat camp according to Abdul Haq. An \\"East Turkistan\\" camp was set up. On 1 March 2010, Abdul Haq was reported to have been killed by a missile launched from an unmanned drone on 15 February 2010. It took place in North Waziristan's area of Mir Ali in Zor Babar Aidak town. His alleged death received no comment from the Turkistan Islamic Party. However, in June 2014, it was reported that Abdul Haq was instead severely wounded but recovered and resumed leadership in 2014. Pictures of Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, Abu Qatada, Ayman al-Zawahiri, Hani al-Siba'i, Abdullah al-Muhaysini, Nasser bin Ali al- Ansi, featured with Abdul Haq al Turkistani in a Turkistan Islamic Party video ISIS was attacked by the Al-Qaeda allied Abdul Haq. The 34th edition of Al Masra, a publication of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula published an article on Abdul Haq al-Turkistani. In a 2019 video released by Islam Awazi, it's propaganda department, Abdul Haq openly blasted China for occupation of East Turkistan. This further refuted claims from America that he was killed in North Waziristan in 2010.

The village is mostly built around a small crossroads, with routes towards Burnley, Nelson and Todmorden. The first buildings in the village date from the 16th century, when the Hare and Hounds public house, which still stands to this day, was built. The village was first officially documented in the 17th century. The origins of the name Haggate are unclear, although it is thought that it could mean, \\"the path by the hawthorn trees\\". The village itself is situated at the top of a hill, 800 feet above sea level. The buildings in the village are predominantly stone-built. As of 2009, Haggate has two public houses, a school and a Baptist church. Haggate has direct road links with Burnley and Nelson, and is served by local bus services (111 and 112) operated by Burnley Bus Company.  History  The parish of Briercliffe has been present since at least 1235 when the Lordship of Briercliffe, Edmund de Lacy, was granted the Charter of Freewarden, allowing him to use the area for hunting hares, rabbits and foxes. The earliest knowledge of the village dates back to the late 16th century when the Hare and Hounds public house, which took its name from the hunting activity in the region, was established. The first official documentation of the village was in the early 17th century, although historians have been unable to elucidate the exact roots of the name. Local folklore suggested that the name came from the fact that an elderly woman (a \\"hag\\") from the village was known to sit on a five-barred gate and watch the world. However, it is now believed that the name is more likely to have been derived from two words ‚Äì \\"hack\\", meaning a hawthorn tree and \\"gate\\", an archaic word for a path or route. In 1644, during the English Civil War, the village was the scene of an altercation in which five people, probably Roundhead supporters, were killed by King Charles I's troops. By the 1700s, the people of Haggate worked mostly as farmers and were major producers of wool. There was also a coal mine, which remained open until the middle of the 20th century, that supplied coal to the mills of Harle Syke and Briercliffe. In the mid-19th century a group of men from Haggate founded the village's first cotton mill, which is today known as 'Oxford Mill', which became the base of many Burnley cotton firms during the time when Lancashire was one of the cotton capitals of the world. There was a cricket field in the village where many Lancashire cricketers played at the invitation of the Smith family who lived in the village. Haggate School, originally a sunday school for the Baptist Church, was built on the site of the cricket pitch in 1882. The school later became the village primary school, and was more recently used by Burnley College.

Since 1933, Tara≈°kievica has been used informally in Belarus and by the Belarusian diaspora abroad.

Around 1994, an alias, Classical Orthography, was introduced by Vincuk Viaƒçorka, the promoter and author of the modern codification of the Tara≈°kievica.Cf. [–ö–ª—ñ–º–∞—û 2004]. For instance see Vincuk Viaƒçorka's article in Spadƒçyna magazine, 1994. In 2005, with the publishing of the Belarusian Classical Orthography, the modern normalization of Tara≈°kievica was made. In 2007 the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority assigned Tara≈°kievica its own variant subtag \\"tarask\\" (full language tag of Belarusian in the Classical orthography is \\"be-tarask\\"). History Branis≈Ça≈≠ Tara≈°kieviƒç In 1918, prior to Belarus declaring independence, a desire for standardising the writing of Belarusian appeared. Several leading linguists made proposals: * \\"Bie≈Çaruskaja hramatyka dla ≈°ko≈Ç\\" by Branis≈Ça≈≠ Tara≈°kieviƒç‚Äîthe first edition used ≈Åacinka (the Latin alphabet), and a Cyrillic variant soon followedAdam Var≈Çyha [–Ø–∑—ç–ø –ì–ª–∞–¥–∫—ñ].

This was for a number of reasons: Tara≈°kieviƒç's orthography was the most well-grounded; it covered the majority of orthographic collisions; it built upon the previous Belarusian orthography; exercises for teaching purposes were included; and it was sponsored by Belarusian political leaders of the time. The work of Tara≈°kieviƒç provided the definitive model for the main features of Belarusian. All later proposals and reforms of the Belarusian language have been based on his codification.–Ü. –Ü. –ö—Ä–∞–º–∫–æ, –ê. –ö. –Æ—Ä—ç–≤—ñ—á, –ê. –Ü. –Ø–Ω–æ–≤—ñ—á. –ì—ñ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—è –±–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å–∫–∞–π –ª—ñ—Ç–∞—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–Ω–∞–π –º–æ–≤—ã. –¢. 2. –ú—ñ–Ω—Å–∫, 1968. –°. 162‚Äì163 Reform proposals and Belarusian orthography reform of 1933 In 1926 in Minsk an international conference on the reform of the Belarusian orthography was held, where some orthography issues were discussed. In 1927 a Linguistic Committee was formed which consisted of the Belarusian academicians and linguists, which worked on the problems of the Belarusian language and mainly developed the orthography norm by Tara≈°kieviƒç. In 1929 with the end of Belarusification the work of the Committee was stopped. Despite this the results of its work was published in 1930. In 1930 a group of scientists from the Belarusian Linguistic Institute started working on another proposal of Belarusian orthography reform. The authors of the proposal declared rejection of the ideas of \\"national democracy\\", which were, according to their beliefs, the base of the work by Linguistic Committee in 1927‚Äì1929. As a result, the group in 1933 proposed a deep revision of the Belarusian language, but kept the ideas of Tara≈°kieviƒç for loanwords in Belarusian and almost entirely reproduced the results of 1930 proposal. Despite this, the proposal was rejected by the USSR authorities because of too low loyalty of approaching of the Belarusian language to Russian.–ö–ª—ñ–º–∞—û –Ü. –î–≤–∞ —Å—Ç–∞–Ω–¥–∞—Ä—Ç—ã –±–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å–∫–∞–π –ª—ñ—Ç–∞—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–Ω–∞–π –º–æ–≤—ã. ‚Äî 2004 // –ú–æ–≤–∞ —ñ —Å–æ—Ü—ã—É–º.

The Belarusian orthography reform of 1933 adopted all the changes of the Academical 1933 proposal which approached the Belarusian language to Russian. The reform introduced both phonetic and morphological changes, as well as vocabulary of Belarusian, where the words with no direct equivalents in the Russian language were excluded and some Russian words introduced.–î–∑–º—ñ—Ç—Ä—ã–π –®—ã–º–∞–Ω—Å–∫—ñ ¬´–•—Ç–æ –∑–Ω—ñ—à—á—ã—û –±–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å–∫—É—é –º–æ–≤—É?¬ª // –î–∑–µ–¥–∑i—á, ‚Ññ 5 (24) (–ª—ñ—Å—Ç–∞–ø–∞–¥, 2003 –≥.)

This rejection was made an issue of ideology, and presented as anti-Russification.E.g., per Jerzy Turonek, Belarusian book under German control (1939‚Äì1944) (in edition: –Æ—Ä—ã –¢—É—Ä–æ–Ω–∞–∫, –ë–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å–∫–∞—è –∫–Ω—ñ–≥–∞ –ø–∞–¥ –Ω—è–º–µ—Ü–∫—ñ–º –∫–∞–Ω—Ç—Ä–æ–ª–µ–º, Minsk, 2002). One of the most vocal critics was Jan Stankieviƒç, beginning with his 1936 publication. However, rejecting all post-1933 official developments, the community was left with all the problems of the pre-1933 grammar virtually unaddressedcf. the materials of Society for the Cleanliness of Belarusian language, Prague, 1930s‚Äì1940s and effectively with no unified grammar to use.cf. the discussion between Jan Stankieviƒç and Masiej Siadnio≈≠ in beg.1950s, the policy of Baƒáka≈≠≈°ƒçyna printing house etc. After the 1930s Tara≈°kievica was primarily used by the Belarusian diaspora abroad. The only wide-scale use of the pre-1933 grammar on the territory of Belarus after the 1930s took place during the German occupation of Belarus in 1941‚Äì1944. Today During the perestroika period of the late 1980s, the movement for the return of Tara≈°kievica in Belarus was initiated. At the beginning of the 1990s Tara≈°kievica was used in Belarus along with the so-called ‚ÄúNarkama≈≠ka,‚Äù the official variant of Belarusian. On 14 June 1992 a conference of journalists and publishers who used the Classical orthography was held in Vilnius. To solve the problem of standardization the Orthography Improvement Committee () was created. The Committee worked in 1991‚Äì1992 and in 1993 published its proposals for orthographic changes. In 2005 to standardize Tara≈°kievica a working group of four people (consisting of Jura≈õ Bu≈°lako≈≠, Vincuk Viaƒçorka, ≈πmicier Sa≈Ñko and Zmicier Sa≈≠ka) work proposed codification of Tara≈°kievica called Belarusian Classical Orthography () as a result of intensive discussions and several years'. This proposal was adopted by major Tara≈°kievica-using media, including the newspaper Nasha Niva, Belarusian ARCHE magazine, the Belarusian editions of Radio Free Europe and Radio Polonia. As well, this variant of orthography became preferable for use in the Belarusian Wikipedia in Tara≈°kievica orthography (:be-tarask:). On 27 April 2007 the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority assigned variant subtag \\"tarask\\" to Tara≈°kievica. The full language tag of Belarusian in the Classical orthography is \\"be-tarask\\".

Potekhina, general changes in the declension system of nouns are possible to Tara≈°kievica, i.e. active reducing of grammar interchanges and their accurate definition as continuation of the unification process of declension types by gender signs. Besides this, single cases of paradigm change for single lexemes occur. Potekhina notes, that the reason for this is the reorientation of literary language norms from the middle dialects of the Belarusian language to the West-Belarusian, that are less influenced by the Russian language, i.e. \\"to a greater extent Belarusian\\". Per Potekhina, the factor or language contacts in the borderlands is not taken into account for this process.  Syntax  The differences mainly affect government of prepositions. { cellspacing=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" style=\\"width: 100%; margin: 0 0 1em 0; border: solid darkgray; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; font-size: 90%; background- color: #fff;\\" - bgcolor=#D0E1E0 align=\\"center\\"  style=\\"width: 50%\\"  Official orthography  style=\\"width: 50%\\"  Tara≈°kievica -style=\\"background:#E4E4E4;\\" align=\\"center\\"  colspan=\\"2\\"  Change of the government of preposition –ø–∞ -style=\\"background:#FAFAFA;\\" align=\\"left\\"  valign=\\"top\\" style=\\"padding-right: 10px;\\"  Variant (–ø–∞ + dative or prepositional case).

Choice of the orthography does not play a considerable part for this, and the differences shown below might be used by the speakers in the wide sense independently of the chosen orthography. { cellspacing=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" style=\\"margin: 0 0 1em 0; border: solid darkgray; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px; font-size: 90%; background-color: #fff;\\" - bgcolor=#D0E1E0 align=\\"center\\"  style=\\"width: 50%\\"  Official orthography  style=\\"width: 50%\\"  Tara≈°kievica -style=\\"background:#E4E4E4;\\" align=\\"center\\"  colspan=\\"2\\"  Borrowed lexical items -style=\\"background:#FAFAFA;\\" align=\\"left\\"  valign=\\"top\\" style=\\"padding- right: 10px;\\"  According to S. Stankieviƒç, due to influence of the Russian language in BSSR, considerable amount of words, not typical for the language, were introduced into Belarusian, that nowadays are used in the official orthography.

Potekhina notes that in an effort to exclude Russisms from the Belarusian language, borrowing from Polish becomes more intense, not necessarily of Polish lexical items. Examples: –ø–∞—Å–æ–ª ‚Üí –∞–º–±–∞—Å–∞–¥–∞—Ä, —Ñ–∞–∫—Ç–∞—Ä ‚Üí —á—ã–Ω—å–Ω—ñ–∫, –∫–∞—Ä—Ç–∞ ‚Üí –º–∞–ø–∞, –≤–∞–¥–∑—ñ—Ü–µ–ª—å ‚Üí –∫—ñ—Ä–æ—û—Ü–∞ -style=\\"background:#E4E4E4;\\" align=\\"center\\"  colspan=\\"2\\"  Lexical items of historically Belarusian origin -style=\\"background:#FAFAFA;\\" align=\\"left\\"  valign=\\"top\\" style=\\"padding-right: 10px;\\"  Per S. Stankieviƒç, an introduction in the Belarusian language of words with Belarusian roots but structured as in the Russian language is taking place; besides this, meanings of the Belarusian words are changed into meanings of respective Russian words having the same pronunciation but a different meaning. Examples: —Å–∫–∞—Å–∞–≤–∞—Ü—å ‚Üí –∞–¥–º—è–Ω—ñ—Ü—å, —Å–∫–ª–∞—Å—Ü—ñ ‚Üí —Å–∞—Å—Ç–∞–≤—ñ—Ü—å, —Ä–∞–±—É–Ω–∞–∫ ‚Üí –≥—Ä–∞–±–µ–∂, –≤–∞–π—Å–∫–æ–≤—ã ‚Üí –≤–æ—ñ–Ω—Å–∫—ñ 15px A significant amount of Belarusian vocabulary was removed in the dictionaries published after the orthographic reform of 1933; in the variable cases, the words present in the Russian language were kept.  valign=\\"top\\"  According to E. Potekhina, some items of Belarusian origin are being substituted. Examples: –∞–¥–±—ã–≤–∞—Ü—Ü–∞ ‚Üí —Ç–∞—á—ã—Ü—Ü–∞, —É–º–æ–≤–∞ ‚Üí –≤–∞—Ä—É–Ω–∞–∫, –Ω–∞–º–∞–≥–∞–Ω—å–Ω—ñ ‚Üí –≤—ã—Å—ñ–ª–∫—ñ, —ñ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–∞ ‚Üí –º–µ–Ω–∞–≤—ñ—Ç–∞In this case, both lexical items are borrowed from . } See also * Belarusian orthography reform of 1933 * Narkamauka * Trasianka ReferencesExternal links * Online copy of Belarusian Classical Orthography book * 1968: Grammatical Changes in Modern Literary Belarusian Language by Professor R.

Described on the basis of a single mandible (lower jaw) with the first molar missing and an isolated upper incisor, both of uncertain but Quaternary age, it is one of the smaller members of the genus Megalomys. Little is known about the animal, and its provenance and distinction from \\"Ekbletomys hypenemus\\", an even larger extinct oryzomyine that also occurred on Barbuda, have been called into question. The toothrow in the lower jaw has a length of 8.7 mm at the alveoli. The third molar is relatively narrow and both the second and third molars have a wide valley between their outer cusps. History Remains of Megalomys audreyae were found by John Walter Gregory among cave breccia on Barbuda around 1900. The exact locality is unknown. In his 1901 description of Oryzomys luciae, Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major mentioned the Barbuda animal as another member of the Megalomys group, but he never published a description of the latter. √âdouard Louis Trouessart gave the name Oryzomys (Megalomys) majori to it in his Catalogus Mammalium, but he did not describe it and therefore the name is a nomen nudum. In 1926, Arthur Hopwood finally described it and named it Megalomys audreyae after Gregory's wife Audrey, following Major's intention.Hopwood, 1926, pp. 328‚Äì329 The oryzomyines of the Caribbean were revised in 1962 by Clayton Ray, who examined the specimens Gregory had found and redescribed them.Ray, 1962, pp. 92‚Äì94 He suggested that M. audreyae may in fact have come from Barbados instead of similarly named Barbuda, citing the occurrence of a different oryzomyine (\\"Ekbletomys hypenemus\\") in other cave deposits on Barbuda, circumstantial evidence for the occurrence of a native rodent on Barbados, uncertainty whether Gregory ever visited Barbuda, and biogeographical considerations.Ray, 1962, pp. 90‚Äì91 In the subsequent literature, M. audreyae has seldom been mentioned and never been further described. In a 1999 review of recent extinctions in mammals, Ross MacPhee and C. Flemming reported that M. audreyae had been recovered from a locality on Barbuda known as Darby Sink, which had been radiocarbon dated to around 1200 BCE. They also stated that M. audreyae and \\"Ekbletomys\\" may in fact be identical.MacPhee and Flemming, 1999, table 2, footnote f However, in 2009 Samuel Turvey suggested that two different rice rats were in fact present in material from Barbuda, which would imply that M. audreyae is a valid species.Turvey, 2009, pp. 52, 61 Description Lower toothrow in the mandible: second and third molar, with the first molar missingRay, 1962, plate XIV The only remains of Megalomys audreyae that have been described in the literature are the original two specimens Gregory found, a left upper incisor and a left mandible (lower jaw). The upper incisor is not grooved and its diameter has a length of 2.6 mm and width of 1.5 mm, but exhibits no other significant characters.Ray, 1962, p. 93, table 7 The mandible, which is severely damaged and lacks the condyloid, coronoid, and angular processes at the back of the bone, contains the second and third molar and part of the lower incisor, but the first molar is missing.Ray, 1962, p. 93 The capsular process of the lower incisor, a slight raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the incisor, is small. The preserved alveoli, the impressions left by the roots, show that the first molar was supported by large roots at the front and back and a smaller root in between these. The second molar is about square and shows the four main cusps commonly present in rodents: the protoconid, metaconid, hypoconid, and entoconid. A strongly developed mesolophid (a crest) is also present, as in most oryzomyines. The main valley between the cusps, the hypoflexid, is broad and V-shaped. The third molar is as long as the second, but it is narrower and the entoconid is poorly developed. Again, the hypoflexid is broad and V-shaped.Ray, 1962, pp. 93‚Äì94 The length of the toothrow at the alveoli is 8.7 mm. The length of the second molar is 2.5 mm and the width is 2.2 mm. The third molar has a length of 2.5 mm and width of 1.8 mm.Ray, 1962, table 7 When Clayton Ray described \\"Ekbletomys hypenemus\\" on the basis of abundant skeletal remains from both Barbuda and Antigua, he carefully distinguished it from M. audreyae, the only other native rodent recorded from those islands.Ray, 1962, pp. 164‚Äì165 M. audreyae is much smaller than \\"Ekbletomys\\"; for example, 72 specimens of the latter had the alveolar length of the lower molars ranging from 10.3 to 12.6 mm (mean 11.6 mm, standard deviation 0.49 mm; compare 8.7 mm for M. audreyae).Ray, 1962, tables 14, 33 In addition, the V-shaped hypoflexids and narrow third molar of M. audreyae contrast with the narrow, parallel-sided hypoflexids and broad third molar of \\"Ekbletomys\\". These characters, and others observable in species of Megalomys represented by more complete material, convinced Ray that M. audreyae and \\"Ekbletomys\\" are not only distinct species, but indeed share no close relationship.Ray, 1962, p. 165 Instead, he proposed that the combination of large size, occurrence in the Lesser Antilles, and similarity in molar morphology indicated a relationship between M. audreyae and other species of Megalomys, and he suggested that the similarly sized M. curazensis from Cura√ßao, off Venezuela, may be most closely related to M. audreyae.Ray, 1962, pp. 94‚Äì95 ReferencesLiterature cited *Hopwood, A.T. 1926.

He was one of the members of Group 42.  Biography  Kamil Lhot√°k was born on 25 July 1912 in Prague- Hole≈°ovice. His mother, Anna Kouglov√°, met and befriended young medical student Kamil Lhot√°k at the ball in ≈Ωof√≠n. The couple never married but, they produced one child from their long-term relationship. Unequal social status and fears of damaging his career led Lhot√°k's father to hide his illegitimate son. However, he financially supported him and his mother his whole life. Lhot√°k Sr. was involved in viral research and experimented with the serum against poliomyelitis. During a rare visit with his family, he infected his young son with this disease. The effects of poliomyelitis deeply influenced Lhot√°k's health. The relationship between Lhot√°k father and son was complicated and traumatic. Thanks to his mother, Lhot√°k became familiar with painting and literature at a young age. He was particularly fond of the works of Jules Verne, Edouard Riou, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. His early artworks were influenced also by modern technical inventions; he often created drawings of cars, motorcycles, and bicycles. In 1932 he began his studies at Jir√°sek Gymnasium in Prague. Together with his classmate he published \\"Auto- moto zpravodaj\\" (Auto-Moto News) and later he participated in publishing school magazine \\"Hled√°n√≠ umƒõn√≠\\". He also often visited the expositions of modern art in Aventinum. Following his graduation at the gymnasium he continued studying at the Faculty of Law of Charles University. Even during these studies, he devoted himself to painting rather than law. In 1938 he married Hertha Guthov√°, and a year later he organized his first exhibition in Beaufort Gallery in Jungmannova Street. In 1940 he became a member of the art association Umƒõleck√° beseda. During the World War II Lhot√°k created hundreds of artworks, and he also helped to establish the significant Czech art association Group 42. The first exhibition of the group was organized in 1943. According to Czech painter Libor F√°ra, one of Lhot√°k's presented paintings, \\"Dcera velkomƒõsta\\" (Daughter of a City), later caught the attention of Pablo Picasso at the exhibition in Paris. In 1954, Lhot√°k began his collaboration with writer Adolf Branald. Together they created a book Dƒõdeƒçek automobil (Grandfather Automobile). Lhot√°k later considered his illustrations for this book as his best works. A year later, in 1955, they cooperated on the production of the film Dƒõdeƒçek automobil. In the 1960s he met Anna Endr≈°tov√°, who became his model and life partner. During the 1960s and 1970s he increased his work activities, annually creating a large number of paintings and book illustrations and also helping with exhibitions. His paintings from that time are influenced by modern art and op-art. He also took inspiration from the works of Roy Lichtenstein. Lhot√°k continued his work in later life, creating in 1990 his last painting, \\"Meteor pad√° do mo≈ôe\\" (Meteor Falls to the Sea). He died on 22 October 1990 in Prague.  Style  Lhot√°k was an entirely self- taught painter, and he developed his style in an individual and original way. His paintings are based on a specific poetic view, and it is almost impossible to classify them into art genres. Technology and its inventions from the beginning of the 20th century, and particularly the pioneering inventions of motoring, aviation, and the railroads became his main source of inspiration. In his works, Lhot√°k also included the motives of the Prague periphery. Despite the dreamy atmosphere and poetic character, Lhot√°k's paintings retain strong reference to the real world and remain solely figurative. Lhot√°k's style was significantly influenced by poetry, and especially by the works of Czech poets Jan Hanƒç and Ivan Blatn√Ω, fellow members of Group 42. During the years he adapted his style to various modern trends, but he managed to maintain his originality and specific artistic expression. He intentionally used some elements of na√Øve art and his works are well received for their directness and understandability.

It tells the tale of six teens who break into the abandoned mental institution, the Danvers State Hospital.  Plot  The Danvers State Hospital, located just outside Boston, Massachusetts, was built in 1878 and condemned in 1992. It is rumored by locals to be the birthplace of the pre-frontal lobotomy. The novel begins at 7 AM, with Derik riding up to the Danvers State Hospital in his car. Looking at the crumbling brick building, he starts to think of the people that were locked up in there, the people who died after spending their lives there. The unmarked mass graves around the premises, the tunnels, and the messed up remnants of its former patients. He knows this is the place. The place where he'd make his movie. Derik is flunking out of school, and he decides to submit his film to a contest and save himself from a future of flipping burgers at his parents' diner. He gathers a cast of different backgrounds, and the eve before the hospitals' demolition, they break in. He gets more than he bargained for when the eerie experience changes his life. Forever.

Instead of studying mental illness, positive neuroscientists focus on valued cognitive qualities that serve to enrich personal life and/or society. Topics in positive neuroscience overlap heavily with those of positive psychology, but use neuroimaging techniques to extend beyond the behavioral level and explain the neurobiology which underpins \\"positive\\" cognitive phenomena such as intelligence, creativity, optimism, and healthy aging. Background Though positive neuroscience is only beginning to be recognized as an emerging field, empirical research of optimal or exceptional brain functioning has been conducted at least as far back as the 1970s. Early work was confined to the use of lesion studies, and thus was only very case- specific. Human electroencephalography, first practiced in 1920, was applied to the study of creativity in the early 1970s. As in vivo brain imaging has become more sophisticated, investigations of positive neuroscience phenomena have incorporated multiple functional neuroimaging techniques (functional magnetic resonance imaging and Positron Emission Tomography) and structural imaging (Diffusion MRI, voxel-based morphometry, in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy). Examples of research centers currently active in the field of positive neuroscience include Martin Seligman's lab at the University of Pennsylvania and Rex Jung's lab at the University of New Mexico, supported by The Mind Research Network. The Templeton Foundation In 2009, the John Templeton Foundation and a committee of advisors at the University of Pennsylvania put out a call for grant proposals aimed at investigators \\"conducting research aimed at gaining a better understanding of the ways in which the brain enables flourishing.\\" Qualifying projects had to \\"apply tools of neuroscience to positive psychological concepts\\", and focus on one of the following areas: * Virtue, strength, and positive emotion: What are the neural bases of the cognitive and affective capacities that enable virtues such as discipline, persistence, honesty, compassion, love, curiosity, social and practical intelligence, courage, creativity, and optimism? * Exceptional abilities: What is special about the brains of exceptional individuals and what can we learn from them? * Meaning and positive purpose: How does the brain enable individuals and groups to find meaning and achieve larger goals? * Decisions, values, and free will: How does the brain enable decisions based on values and how can decision-making be improved? What can neuroscience reveal about the nature of human freedom? * Religious belief, prayer, and meditation: How do religious and spiritual practices affect neural function and behavior?
