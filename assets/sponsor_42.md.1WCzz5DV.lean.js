The Antwerp premetro tram route 3 is a tram route connecting Merksem with Melsele in the city of Antwerp. The route is operated by the Flemish transport company De Lijn and historically also by its Antwerp predecessor, MIVA (Maatschappij Intercommunaal Vervoer Antwerpen). History Tram 3 is one of the oldest tram lines in Antwerp. The original electric tram route 3 was opened on October 9, 1902 on the Groenplaats - Antwerp South station (Zuidstatie) trajectory. A year later, the route was already extended from the Groenplaats to Antwerp Central Station (Middenstatie). In 1904, the route was once again extended, this time from Antwerp Central Station to the (now demolished) Schijnpoort gate in the Seefhoek neighborhood, via the Carnotstraat, Kerkstraat and Pothoekstraat. In 1906, works start on a third extension, from Schijnpoort to Oude Bareel in Merksem via the Bredabaan, and were finished later that year. Trams servicing the whole route until Oude Bareel used a mixed white/yellow rollsign, while those stopping at Schijnpoort used plain yellow signs. In 1936, the trajectory of route 4 (Hoboken -Groenplaats) is coupled to route 3 at the request of the Antwerp city council, as a means to decongest the Groenplaats. After the Second World War, however, route 4 is restored in its original state, and route 3 once again runs between Antwerp South Station and Oude Bareel, with route 3 bis having its terminal at the Suikerrui near the Grote Markt. On March 20, 1962, the first PCC cars are introduced on the route. In 1965, due to the construction of the Antwerp Ring road and the demolition of old Antwerp South Station, the route shortened to the nearby Lambermontplaats. In 1968, the old turning loop at the Raoul Gr√©groireplein is replaced by a new one at the Van Der Delftstraat at the Schijnpoort/Sportpaleis terminus. On October 5, 1970, route 3 is the last tram route in Antwerp to switch to a one-man steering system. At the same time, the tram cars were fitted with an automatic ticketing system. However, some conductors could still be seen on the trams in the following years, as some of the former conductors were unfit for the supplementary training to be employed elsewhere. In 1972, works begins on the Antwerp premetro with the construction of a central axis between the Groenplaats and Antwerp Central Station. Due to these works, route 3 is shortened to the Grote Markt, where a temporary turning loop has been built. Also, a temporary shuttle tram route between the Groenplaats and Lambermontplaats is put into service during the works. As of 1973, route 3 no longer used its old trajectory over the Schoenmarkt, Meir and Keyserlei between the Groenplaats and Antwerp Central Station, as these streets were inaccessible due to the premetro works. Instead, the route used a more northern trajectory via the Gemeentestraat, Rooseveldtplaats, Lange Nieuwstraat and Kipdorp toward a new terminus at the Melkmarkt. In 1978, after the finishing of the premetro works, the shuttle route between the Lambermontplaats and Groenplaats is added to route 8, and route 3 is shortened to the Groenplaats. Also, in 1975, works start on the Bredabaan on the construction of a separate tram lane between Oude Bareel and the Frans de l'Arbrelaan. Initially, it was planned that the buses of the NMVB, which operated the regional network, would also use this separate lane, which led to an increased with as the tram lane to offer the buses the necessary space. However, in 1978, the NMVB decided not to use the central tram lane, and to continue to use the old stops on the exterior lane. The bus routes on the Bredabaan would only much later use the tram stops on the central lane. In 1994, work officially starts to finish the northern premetro axis running between Antwerp Central Station and the Sportpaleis. During the last weekend of March in 1996, traffic on the route is suspended to allow for the construction of the premetro entrance at the Gabriel Theunisbrug over the Albert Canal. On April 1, 1996, the northern premetro axis is officially opened and put into use by tram route 3, which can now use the underground trajectory instead of its original itinerary over the Pothoekstraat and Kerkstraat. From Astrid station near Antwerp Central Station, the route would use the central premetro axis toward the Groenplaats. Because of the construction of the metro tunnel link with Linkeroever some years earlier, the route was at the same time extended to the Linkeroever terminus, where a new platform was built to accommodate the line.http://allemaalbusjes.skynetblogs.be/archive/2008/12/14/tramlijn-3.html Retrieved 27 June 2016 On February 16, 2002, route 3 was extended from Linkeroever to the Zwijndrecht-Melsele border, a 4,3 km trajectory, where a P+R facility was built.http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dst26012002_020 Retrieved 27 June 2016 On September 1, 2002, the route was once again extended, this time on a 1,6 km trajectory toward the newly built Keizershoek P+R in Merksem.http://www.antwerpen.be/docs/Stad/Stadsvernieuwing/Bestemmingsplannen/BPA_11002_224_70004_00001/BPA_11002_224_70004_00001_0000Document_tn.html Retrieved 27 June 2016 Colour This line's colour on maps is black text on a yellow background.

Rolling stock  Most trams on route 3 are of the newer HermeLijn type. The older PCC cars can only sporadically be seen on the route when an event at the Sportpaleis is taking place and extra capacity is needed to transport all the visitors. Future During the construction works concerning the elevation of the Gabriel Theunis bridge over the Albert Canal, tram traffic between Merksem and the Sportpaleis will not be possible. The elevation of the bridge to a height of is necessary to allow bigger ships on the canal, as a part of a general program to increase the share of water transport and lower that of road cargo transport in the congested Antwerp region. Works were originally planned to start in 2014, but due to delays only started in April 2019. Planning is now for the bridge to be delivered in April 2021. In the distant future, the line might be extended to Beveren (to the west) and Brasschaat (to the north). However, the extension to Brasschaat in particular has been subject to considerable controversy, as fears exist among inhabitants that the town might lose it distinct atmosphere, and become too urbanized after the construction of a tramway. Concrete plans for the extension have been prepared,http://omgeving.be/blog/projecten/3350/ Retrieved 28 June 2016 but, as many citizens and local politicians have ousted themselves against the construction of the tramway, including mayor Jan Jambon, its construction in the near future seems highly unlikely.http://www.demorgen.be/binnenland/bang-voor-de-tram-bang-voor-de- stad-bbda7aff/ Retrieved 28 June 2016  See also  * List of town tramway systems in Belgium  References   External links  * www.delijn.be, the operator of all public city transport in Antwerp and Flanders.

The Millennium books were originally intended to be released as one motion picture and two television mini-series, but popular demand and pressure from the Swedish Film Institute, one of the main financiers behind the films, altered the original plans. The Millennium films have been sold to most European and many Latin American markets. The films also had a US release. Yellow Bird executive producer S√∂ren Staermose confirmed in an interview with Swedish newspaper Expressen that negotiations are taking place to produce English language Millennium films. This would not be a US remake of the Swedish films but rather new Hollywood films based on the books. In the interview he states that the possible US films might be produced in a similar way as the Wallander TV series starring Kenneth Branagh, shooting in Sweden using English speaking actors. He also states that it is up to the director and says that the story could just as well take place in another country, like Canada.

Biography Cooley was born in Texas, and was unofficially adopted as a boy and raised by rancher Tim Williamson. As a child, Tim Williamson and his wife nursed Cooley through a serious illness when he contracted typhoid, and Cooley treated the couple with the utmost respect. He joined the Texas Rangers as a young man. He was well respected as a lawman, and even feared due to his relentless pursuit of outlaws. However, on May 13, 1875, Tim Williamson was falsely arrested in Mason County, Texas for cattle rustling by Deputy Sheriff John Worley (sometimes spelled John Worhle). While Williamson was being escorted to jail by Worley, an angry mob of German cattle ranchers jerked him aside and shot him to death. This event marked the beginning of what would be called the Mason County War, known also as the \\"Hoodoo War\\". When Cooley received the news at the Texas Ranger camp where his Ranger Company was based, he broke into uncontrollable crying, which quickly turned to anger. Cooley blamed Worley for Williamson's death, believing that he was in cahoots with the Germans, as Worley was of German descent. However, he waited for indictments to be passed down from the court against those responsible for Williamson's death, but when none came, he took matters into his own hands. Cooley went to Worley's home, where Worley was working on his well with a helper. Cooley shot and killed Worley on sight. He then scalped him, and displayed the scalp as a prize to the Germans. Cooley then killed German cattleman Charley Bader. By that time gunman Johnny Ringo had joined Cooley, along with several others. Two of Ringo's friends, Moses Baird and George Gladden, were ambushed shortly thereafter by a posse led by Sheriff John Clark, during which Baird was killed and Gladden seriously wounded. That posse included Peter Bader, brother to Cooley's second victim, Carl Bader. Johnny Ringo and a friend named Bill Williams rode boldly into Mason, Texas on September 25, 1875, riding up in front of the house of James Cheyney, the man who led Gladden and Baird into the ambush. As Cheyney came out, both Ringo and Williams shot and killed him. The two then rode to the house of Dave Doole, and called him outside, but when he came out with a gun, they fled back into town. Four days later, Scott Cooley and John Baird, brother to Moses Baird, then killed German cowboy Daniel Hoerster, and wounded Germans Peter Jordan and Henry Plueneke. The German cattlemen then retaliated, hanging two men they suspected had assisted Cooley. The next day Texas Rangers arrived, finding the town in chaos, and Cooley and his faction gone. Major John B. Jones of the Texas Rangers dispatched three parties to pursue Cooley and his followers. The next day local Sheriff John Clark dispatched a posse of deputies to arrest Bill Coke, suspected of assisting Cooley. Coke was located and arrested, but allegedly \\"escaped\\" while on the way to town. Coke was never seen again, and it is suspected that the posse executed him. Charley Johnson, a friend to Bill Coke, then appeared in town looking for blacksmith William Miller, who had been a member of the posse that arrested Coke. He found Miller at his workplace, and shot him down. Badly wounded, Miller was saved only by his wife running outside and throwing herself toward him, at which point Johnson simply walked away. By this time, killings were almost random. There was no local law enforcement to speak of, as the sheriff was obviously supporting the German cattlemen, and no arrests had been made against either side short of the arrest of Bill Coke. The Texas Rangers were also doing little to help matters, as many were friends to Scott Cooley. Frustrated, Major Jones asked that if any of them felt they could not perform their duty by pursuing Cooley, they should step forward. Fifteen of them did so, willing to accept discharges rather than to pursue Cooley. The Texas Governors office was by this time receiving letters in support of Cooley, stating the local sheriff was in support of the German cattlemen, which was filtering down on Major Jones, prompting him to act swiftly. At the end of December, 1875, Cooley and Ringo were arrested by Sheriff A. J. Strickland for threatening the life of Burnet County, Texas Deputy Sheriff John J. Strickland. They later escaped from the Lampasas County, Texas jail, with the help of friends, but their arrests essentially stopped the violence. Cooley later escaped a posse near the Llano River, fleeing into Blanco County, Texas, and was never officially seen again. He is believed to have either been wounded by that posse and died shortly thereafter, or to have died due to what was referred to as \\"brain fever\\" shortly thereafter. He is believed to have been hiding out at the Nimitz Hotel in Fredericksburg, Texas at the time. However, neither of the reported death scenarios has ever been confirmed.

In another departure from the comic, he holds a love of powerful firearms, including two Desert Eagles, two miniguns, two .500 S&W; Magnums, two Sawed-off shotguns, and a pair of four-barreled shotguns. He also wears a series of outlandish costumes such as a long fur coat and hat inspired by blaxploitation films and Russians, a Nazi uniform, and a samurai robe and hairpiece inspired by classic kung-fu movies.Samuel L. Jackson Takes Us Through His 'Spirit' Wardrobe The film combines elements of Dr. Cobra from The Spirit comics with the Octopus in that he is revealed to have been responsible for the Spirit's resurrection and immortality thanks to a regenerative formula he invented and injected himself with as well after succeeding. His quest in the film is to get his hands on the Blood of Heracles to drink and become a god. Following a fight with the Spirit, the Octopus escapes but ends up with Jason's Golden Fleece desired by Sand Saref, now with the blood. After going to desperate measures trying to find Sand and kill the Spirit, the Octopus hires a beautiful assassin, Plaster of Paris, to take down his nemesis. At the end of the film, the Octopus is finally defeated in a manner similar to his demise in the comic, being blown up by a grenade. However, his severed finger is found by Silken Floss, implying he may return. Project Superpowers The Octopus is mentioned in Alex Ross and Jim Krueger's Project Superpowers series. In that series he has supposedly been killed by The Flame, and his criminal empire is now run by his widow.

As well as being an authority on naval matters, he was also the first editor of the Times Literary Supplement. Thursfield was born in Kidderminster and educated at Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he obtained a first-class degree in Literae Humaniores in 1863. He was appointed to a fellowship of Jesus College, Oxford in 1864, holding this until 1881, when he was obliged to resign because of his marriage in 1880. He was then appointed by Thomas Chenery, editor of The Times, as a leader writer. He soon established himself as an authority on naval matters, publishing works such as The Navy and the Nation (1897), Nelson and other Naval Studies (1909), and Naval Warfare (1913). He lectured on naval strategy to the Staff College, Camberley and the Royal United Service Institution. Thursfield was close to successive First Lords of the Admiralty, of various political views, and to Jackie Fisher in Fisher's campaign for navy reforms. Fisher regarded Thursfield as \\"a great student of naval affairs\\", saying that his articles were \\"close and precisely reasoned, unadulterated by vituperation\\". Prince Louis of Battenberg, who served for a time as director of naval intelligence, praised Thursfield for never being afraid to state a contrary view. Thursfield worked in other areas apart from naval matters, taking charge of The Times's \\"Books of the week\\" in 1891, which became the Times Literary Supplement in 1902, of which he was the first editor. He wrote a biography of Robert Peel in 1891. He was made an honorary fellow of Jesus College in 1908. He was knighted in the 1920 New Year Honours. He died at his home in Golders Green on 22 November 1923.

His stabilization of the internal political scene after the decade-long \\"Anarchy at Samarra\\", his successful defence of Iraq against the Saffarids and the suppression of the Zanj Rebellion restored a measure of the Caliphate's former power and began a period of recovery, which culminated in the reign of al-Muwaffaq's own son, the Caliph al-Mu'tadid. Early life Family tree of the Abbasid dynasty in the middle and late 9th century Talha, commonly known by the teknonym Abu Ahmad, was the son of the Caliph Ja'far al-Mutawakkil () and a slave concubine, Umm Ishaq. In 861, he was present in his father's murder at Samarra by the Turkish military slaves (ghilman): the historian al-Tabari reports that he had been drinking with his father that night, and came upon the assassins while going to the toilet, but after a brief attempt to protect the caliph, he retired to his own rooms when he realized that his efforts were futile. The murder was almost certainly instigated by al-Mutawakkil's son and heir, al-Muntasir, who immediately ascended the throne; nevertheless Abu Ahmad's own role in the affair is suspect as well, given his close ties later on with the Turkish military leaders. According to Hugh N. Kennedy, \\"it is possible, therefore, that Abu Ahmad had already had close links with the young Turks before the murder, or that they were forged on that night\\". This murder opened a period of internal upheaval known as the \\"Anarchy at Samarra\\", where the Turkish military chiefs vied with other powerful groups and with each other over control of the government and its financial resources. It was during this period of turmoil, in February 865, that Caliph al-Musta'in () and two of the senior Turkish officers, Wasif and Bugha the Younger, fled Samarra to Baghdad, where they could count on the support of the Tahirids. The Turkish army in Samarra then selected al-Musta'in's brother al-Mu'tazz () as Caliph, and Abu Ahmad was entrusted with the conduct of operations against al-Musta'in and his supporters. The ensuing siege of Baghdad lasted from February to December 865, after which a negotiated settlement was reached. Contrary to the agreed terms, however, al-Musta'in was murdered. It was most likely during this time that Abu Ahmad consolidated his relationship with the Turkish military, especially with Musa ibn Bugha, who played a crucial role during the siege. Abu Ahmad further solidified these ties when he secured a pardon for Bugha the Younger. On his return to Samarra, Abu Ahmad was initially received with honour by the Caliph, but soon he was thrown into prison as a potential rival, along with another of his brothers, al-Mu'ayyad. The latter was soon executed, but Abu Ahmad survived thanks to the protection of the Turkish military. Eventually, he was released and exiled to Basra before being allowed to return to Baghdad. He was so popular there that at the time of al-Mu'tazz's death, there was popular agitation in the city in favour of his elevation to Caliph. Instead, al-Muhtadi () was chosen. Regent of the Caliphate Gold dinar of al- Mu'tamid, with the names of al-Muwaffaq and the vizier Sa'id ibn Makhlad (Dhu'l-Wizaratayn) At the time al-Muhtadi was killed by the Turks in June 870, Abu Ahmad was at Mecca. Immediately he hastened north to Samarra, where he and Musa ibn Bugha effectively sidelined the new Caliph, al-Mu'tamid (r. 870‚Äì892), and assumed control of the government. Al-Muwaffaq differed from most Abbasid princes of his time through his close association with and participation in military affairs. In this his career echoes that of his grandfather, the Caliph al-Mu'tasim (). Like him, al-Muwaffaq's power relied to a great extent on his close association with the Turkish military: following the demands of the Turkish rank and file for one of the Caliph's brothers to be appointed as their commander, bypassing their own leaders, who were accused of misappropriating salaries, he was appointed the main intermediary between the caliphal government and the Turkish military. In return for the Turks' loyalty he abolished the other competing corps of the caliphal army such as the Maghariba or the Faraghina, which are no longer mentioned after . Hugh Kennedy sums up the arrangement thus: \\"al-Muwaffaq assured their status and their position as the army of the caliphate and al-Muwaffaq's role in the civil administration meant that they received their pay\\". Al-Muwaffaq's close personal relationship with the Turkish military leadership‚Äîinitially Musa ibn Bugha, as well as Kayghalagh and Ishaq ibn Kundaj after Musa's death in 877‚Äîhis own prestige as a prince of the dynasty, and the exhaustion after a decade of civil strife, allowed him to establish unchallenged control over the Turks, as indicated by their willingness to participate in costly campaigns under his leadership. Within a short time, Abu Ahmad was conferred an extensive governorate covering most of the lands still under caliphal authority: western Arabia, southern Iraq with Baghdad, and Fars. To denote his authority, he assumed an honorific name in the style of the caliphs, al- Muwaffaq bi-Allah. His power was further expanded in 875, when the Caliph included him in the line of succession after his own son, Ja'far al-Mufawwad, and divided the empire in two large spheres of government. The western provinces were given to al-Mufawwad, while al-Muwaffaq was given charge of the eastern ones; in practice, al-Muwaffaq continued to exercise control over the western provinces as well. With al-Mu'tamid largely confined to Samarra, al- Muwaffaq and his personal secretaries (Sulayman ibn Wahb, Sa'id ibn Makhlad, and Isma'il ibn Bulbul) ruled the Caliphate from Baghdad. What little autonomy al-Mu'tamid enjoyed was further curtailed after the death of the long-serving vizier Ubayd Allah ibn Yahya ibn Khaqan in 877, when al-Muwaffaq assumed the right to appoint the Caliph's viziers himself. Al-Muwaffaq's personal secretary Sa'id ibn Makhlad was the outstanding figure in the Caliphate's bureaucracy until his own disgrace in 885, followed after by Isma'il ibn Bulbul, who served concurrently as vizier to both brothers. =Campaigns= As the main military leader of the Caliphate, it fell upon al-Muwaffaq to meet the numerous challenges to caliphal authority that sprung up during these years. Indeed, as Michael Bonner writes, \\"al-Muwaffaq's decisive leadership was to save the Abbasid caliphate from destruction on more than one occasion\\". The main military threats to the Abbasid Caliphate were the Zanj Rebellion in southern Iraq and the ambitions of Ya'qub ibn al-Layth, the founder of the Saffarid dynasty, in the east. Al-Muwaffaq's drive and energy played a crucial role in their suppression. Saffarid invasion A humble soldier, Ya'qub, surnamed al-Saffar (\\"the Coppersmith\\"), had exploited the decade-long Samarra strife to first gain control over his native Sistan, and then to expand his control. By 873 he ruled over almost all of the eastern lands of the Caliphate, ousting the hitherto dominant Tahirids from power, a move denounced by al-Muwaffaq. Finally, in 875 he seized control of the province of Fars, which not only provided much of the scarce revenue for the Caliphate's coffers, but was also dangerously close to Iraq. The Abbasids tried to prevent an attack by Ya'qub by formally recognizing him as governor over all the eastern provinces and by granting him special honours, including adding his name to the Friday prayer and appointment to the influential position of sahib al-shurta (chief of police) in Baghdad. Nevertheless, in the next year Ya'qub began his advance on Baghdad, until he was confronted and decisively beaten by the Abbasids under al-Muwaffaq and Musa ibn Bugha at the Battle of Dayr al- Aqul near Baghdad. The Abbasid victory, a complete surprise to many, saved the capital and allowed for the recovery of Ahwaz, but despite Ya'qub's death from illness in 879 the Saffarids remained firmly ensconced in their possession of most of Iran. Zanj Revolt Map of Iraq in the 9th‚Äì10th centuries The struggle against the uprising of the Zanj slaves in the marshlands of southern Iraq‚Äîaccording to Michael Bonner \\"the greatest slave rebellion in the history of Islam\\"‚Äîwhich began in September 869, was longer and more difficult, and almost brought the Caliphate to is knees. Due to the Saffarid threat, the Abbasids could not mobilize against the Zanj until 879. Consequently, the Zanj initially held the upper hand, capturing much of lower Iraq including Basra and Wasit and defeating the Abbasid armies, which were reduced to trying to contain the Zanj advance. The balance tipped after 879, when al-Muwaffaq's son Abu'l-Abbas, the future Caliph al-Mu'tadid (r. 892‚Äì902), was given the command. Abu'l-Abbas was joined in 880 by al-Muwaffaq himself, and in a succession of engagements in the marshes of southern Iraq, the Abbasid forces drove back the Zanj towards their capital, Mukhtara, which fell in August 883. Another son of al-Muwaffaq, Harun, also participated in the campaigns. He also served as nominal governor of a few provinces, but died young on 7 November 883. The victory over the Zanj was celebrated as a major triumph for al- Muwaffaq personally and for his regime: al-Muwaffaq received the victory title al-Nasir li-Din Allah, \\"he who upholds the Faith of God\\", while his secretary Sa'id ibn Makhlad received the title Dhu'l-Wizaratayn, \\"holder of the two vizierates\\". Relations with the Tulunids At the same time, al-Muwaffaq also had to confront the challenge posed by the ambitious governor of Egypt, Ahmad ibn Tulun. The son of a Turkish slave, Ibn Tulun had been the province's governor since the reign of al-Mu'tazz, and expanded his power further in 871, when he expelled the caliphal fiscal agent and assumed direct control of Egypt's revenue, which he used to create an army of ghilman of his own. Exploiting the rift between the increasingly powerless Caliph and his brother with demonstrations of support for the former, and relying on his powerful army, Ibn Tulun managed to gain control over Syria and the frontier zone with the Byzantine Empire (the Thughur). By 882, he governed as a de facto independent ruler, adding his own name to the coins alongside the names of the Caliph and his heir. Al-Muwaffaq tried to counter Ibn Tulun's advances by naming the trusted Musa ibn Bugha as governor of Egypt, but lack of funds foiled his plans, allowing Ibn Tulun to consolidate his power in the west. In 882, al-Mu'tamid tried to escape from Samarra to seek sanctuary with Ibn Tulun, but was apprehended and placed under effective house arrest. This event opened the rift between Ibn Tulun and al-Muwaffaq even further. Ibn Tulun tried to declare jihad against the regent, and the latter had curses against the Tulunid read in the mosques across the Caliphate. From that moment, Egypt and Syria were effectively cut off from the rest of the Caliphate. After Ibn Tulun's death in 884, al-Muwaffaq attempted again to retake control of Egypt from Ibn Tulun's successor Khumarawayh. Khumarawayh however defeated an expedition under Abu'l-Abbas, and extended his control over most of the Jazira and Cilicia as well. In 886, al-Muwaffaq was forced to recognize the Tulunids as governors over Egypt and Syria for 30 years, in exchange for an annual tribute of 300,000 gold dinars. Involvement in Khurasan and Persia With the Zanj subdued, after 883 al-Muwaffaq turned his attention again to the east. Ya'qub al-Saffar's brother and successor, Amr ibn al-Layth, had acknowledged the Caliph's suzerainty and had been rewarded with the governorship over the eastern provinces and the position of sahib al-shurta of Baghdad‚Äîessentially the same posts the Tahirids had held‚Äîin exchange for an annual tribute, but soon he was having trouble asserting his authority, especially in Khurasan, where Rafi ibn Harthama emerged as the leader of the former Tahirid troops. In 884/885, Amr was formally deprived of his governorship of Khurasan in favour of the Dulafid Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz, and the army under the vizier Sa'id ibn Makhlad conquered most of the province of Fars, forcing Amr himself to come west. After initial success against the general Tark ibn al-Abbas, Amr was routed by Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz in 886, and again in 887 by al-Muwaffaq in person. Nevertheless, the threat by the Tulunids and the Byzantines in the west forced al-Muwaffaq to negotiate a settlement in 888/889 that largely restored the previous status quo. In 890, al-Muwaffaq again attempted to take back Fars, but this time Ahmad ibn Abd al- Aziz was defeated, and another agreement restored peace and Amr's titles and possessions. =Final years and the succession= Towards the end of the 880s, al-Muwaffaq's relations with his son Abu'l-Abbas deteriorated, although the reason is unclear. In 889, Abu'l-Abbas was arrested and imprisoned on his father's orders, where he remained despite the demonstrations of the ghilman loyal to him. He apparently remained under arrest until May 891, when al- Muwaffaq, already nearing his death, returned to Baghdad after two years in Jibal. By this time, the gout from which he had long suffered had incapacitated him to the extent that he could nor ride, and required a specially prepared litter. It was evident to observers that he was nearing his end. The vizier Ibn Bulbul, who was opposed to Abu'l-Abbas, called al-Mu'tamid and al-Mufawwad into the city, but the popularity of Abu'l-Abbas with the troops and the populace was such that he was released from captivity and recognized as his father's heir. Al-Muwaffaq died on 2 June, and was buried in al-Rusafah near his mother's tomb. Two days later, Abu'l-Abbas succeeded his father in his offices and received the oath of allegiance as second heir after al-Mufawwad. In October 892, al-Mu'tamid died and Abu'l-Abbas al-Mu'tadid brushed aside his cousin to ascend the throne, quickly emerging as \\"the most powerful and effective Caliph since al-Mutawakkil\\" (Kennedy).

Natural England's Environmental Stewardship scheme describes lowland heath as containing dry heath, wet heath and valley mire communities, usually below 250 metres in altitude, on acidic soils and shallow peat, typically comprising heathers, gorses, fine grasses, wild flowers and lichens in a complex mosaic. Heathers and other dwarf shrubs usually account for at least 25% of the ground cover. By contrast, upland heath, which is above 300 metres in altitude, is called Moorland, Dartmoor being an example. Characteristics Lowland heath occurs on a range of acidic pH < 5, impoverished soils that are often sandy and free draining, characteristically podsols.Webb N R, 1986 Heathlands. Collins, London There are no deep-burrowing earthworms so soil profile boundaries are sharp. There is often a thick litter layer on top of slow-decaying leaf litter . The habitat is susceptible to drought in summer and due to its freely draining nature. As many of the plants are waxy, fire is a hazard. A plant-animal association has adapted to these harsh conditions. There are three types of lowland heath according to their location and climate conditions: wet (impervious rocks/clay preventing water drainage), dry (well drained), and humid (between the two types). Wet heaths contain more different species than dry, such as sphagnum mosses and carnivorous plants (Drosera, Pinguicula). Development Some 80% of lowland heath has been lost since 1800, with the UK holding a fifth of the world's remaining stock. Pollen grain carbon dating has indicated that it has existed in the UK for 14,000 years as the ice-caps retreated. As the weather warmed, trees became established and replaced the tundra heath. But 5000 years ago man began to clear forests, and heathland re-established on acid, sandy soils. Its area is thought to have peaked around the 16th century (Tubbs, 1991). From then onwards agricultural and transport technology improved, allowing nutrients to be put back into the soil, nonheathland type crops to grow, or the heath was simply no longer managed as in the past. Heathland succession moves from grasses and bracken to gorses and heather, and finally to woodland (birch, pine and oaks). Heaths are man-made. Heathland was originally wooded with rich soil. As the woods were removed the soils eroded and leached; especially nitrogen easily leaches away. Indicators *Heathers ‚Äì (Ling) ( Calluna vulgaris ) is dominant on moorland; the flowers are pale purple, the plant branches extensively, the leaves are in opposite pairs (not whorls); and are oily in order to prevent water loss. Their mycorrhizal fungus, Hymenoscyphus ericae , is unusual in being able to degrade soil humic materials, giving the plant access to immobilised nutrients (Read 1996, Kerley & Read 1998). Bell Heather Erica cinerea flowers in mid-July, is crimson purple; its leaves are dark green in whorls of three leaves. Cross-leaved heath Erica tetralix can be found in wetter patches, it has rose pink flowers with a nodding drooping head at the end of the shoot and is not as dense a head as bell heather. The leaves are arranged as a cross of four, are greyish with hairs, and are curled downward‚Äîthe hairs trap moisture. The plants shut down in summer and grow more in winter. Heathers have a six-year pioneer phase, which is the time they take to form a bush, then it grows until it is about 25 years old, when the centre starts to have gaps due to less vigorous growth. mosses/bryophytes start to colonise this area due to the humid conditions. The plant begins to degenerate after 30 years. *Gorse ‚Äì Ulex europeaus flowers throughout the year but peaks in the spring. ; Western Gorse is smaller and flowers mid-July to mid-August on the more exposed areas. Dwarf gorse is found on the Dorset heaths. Gorses are part of the pea family and have nitrogen fixing ability due to their symbiotic association with bacteria. *Bracken ‚Äì Pteridium aquilium is a fern, but is a serious weed due to its deep tough rhizomes. It was formerly cut and used as bedding. Sometimes it was burnt for ash lime.Woodbury common has a fascination history about this subject. *Grasses ‚Äì Purple Moor Grass Molinia caerulea is found in wet locations and is edible when young; fescues Festuca spp and bristle bent are found in dry locations. *No mammals *Many insects. Typical animal species found in lowland heath are: *Snakes and reptiles. In the UK the Smooth snake is only found on heaths Dorset. The Sand Lizard is also a heath speciesm but also found on sand dunes. *Birds ‚Äì Dartford warbler, stonechat, nightjar, hobby (feeds on insects and birds), Tree pipit, wren. Structure An ideal heathland includes vegetation of various heights and structures, scattered trees and scrub, some bare ground, wet heaths, ponds, water and bogs. The cover of dwarf shrubs should be between 25% and 95% with at least two frequent species. There must be a range of age classes of heather present, with cover of young heather between 10 and 15%, and cover of old heather between 10 and 30%. cover of undesirable species (bracken, injurious weeds, invasive nonnative plants) must be less than 10%; the cover of trees/scrub must be less than 15%. Threats  Threats to heathland include changes in farmland; afforestation; fire; lack of management (overgrowth), for example scrub and bracken encroachment; housing development; quarrying; nutrient enrichment (often dog faeces - Shaw et al. 1995); pine and silver birch, which readily establish and shade the surrounding vegetation; ploughing; and predatory cats (urban heathland sites). Management  Options include cutting trees (such as for firewood), using grazing animals to control vegetation and regrowth, controlling scrub, making sure there is an age range, and trying to incorporate the requirement of individual species. There is a UK Biodiversity Action Plan with a target of restoring 58,000 hectares of lowland heathland and recreating a further 6000 hectares. In addition, grants are available in England under Natural England's Environmental Stewardship scheme.

He is the Director of Rugby at Newcastle Falcons, a position he has held since 2012. Richards was a number eight and played 314 games for Leicester Tigers between 1982 and 1997, he was captain as Leicester won the 1994-95 Courage League and the 1997 Pilkington Cup, and also played as Leicester won the inaugural English league title in 1987-88 and the 1993 Pilkington Cup. He played 48 times for between 1986 and 1996, a world record number of caps for his position at the time, including the 1987, 1991 and 1995 Rugby World Cups, and represented the British Lions on their 1989 tour to Australia and 1993 tour to New Zealand playing in six international matches. He was widely regarded as one of the best number eights to have played the game. In 1998 he retired from playing and was immediately appointed Leicester Director of Rugby. Leicester won the Premiership Rugby title in Richards' first four seasons in charge and also won the Heineken Cup in 2001 and 2002, the first side to retain the trophy. Richards spent one year with FC Grenoble in France's Top 16. He then joined Harlequins from 2005 to 2009, winning the second division in 2006, and leading them to second in the Premiership in 2009. He was banned from coaching for the next three years following the Bloodgate scandal. After the expiration of his ban he was appointed by Newcastle Falcons and won the second division again in 2013. Playing career =Junior honours and Leicester debut= Richards was schooled at John Cleveland College, in Hinckley, and was capped three times for England Schools in 1981. He played for Roanne in France for a year before returning to England to play for Leicester Tigers.

Richards played in four matches at the inaugural Rugby World Cup in 1987. After the 1988 Five Nations Championship match between Scotland and England Richards received a one match ban from the Rugby Football Union after an incident post match which damaged the Calcutta Cup. Richards won the first club silverware of his career when Leicester beat Waterloo to win the 1987‚Äì88 Courage League, England's first official league title. Richards was selected alongside three other Leicester players for England's tour of Australia and Fiji. Injuries limited Richards to only 15 appearances for Leicester in 1988-89, though he was able to feature in the losing 1988-89 Pilkington Cup final against Bath, before being selected for the 1989 British Lions tour to Australia. Richards played in all three tests for the Lions and his powerful mauling play was the bedrock of the Lions success. =1989-94: Grandslams, Cup win and Lions tour= On his return from Australia Richards was appointed Leicester captain but injured his shoulder in only the second match of the season, the injury proved so serious he missed the rest of the 1989-90 season.

The 1995-96 season was one of near misses for Leicester as they lost the 1995-96 Courage League on the last day of the season with a home defeat to Harlequins and then lost the 1996 Pilkington Cup Final to Bath with a controversial last minute penalty try. The following season, Richards led Leicester to their first Heineken Cup final against Brive, at Cardiff Arms Park, which was won by Brive by 28 points to nine. Richards made his 300th appearance for Leicester on 25 February 1997 in a match at Welford Road against the Barbarians. The final match in his career was played on 30 December 1997, against Newcastle Falcons, at Welford Road. Personal life Richards was a police constable for Leicestershire Constabulary between the 1980s and 1990s before English rugby union became professional. Coaching career =Leicester= Richards took over from Bob Dwyer as coach of Leicester in 1998, and in his first full season as Director of Rugby won the Allied Dunbar Premiership, the third time in club history. Tigers successfully defended the title for four years in a row under him. Leicester also won two Heineken Cups, defeating Stade Fran√ßais 34‚Äì30 in 2001 and beating Munster 15‚Äì9 in 2002. After two trophy-less seasons and a failure to get out of the pool in Europe, Richards left the club in February 2004, ending a 23-year association with the club. =Grenoble= In June 2004, Richards was appointed as coach at French club FC Grenoble for the following season. Grenoble struggled in the French rugby championship and it was announced in May 2005 that Richards would leave the club at the end of the season by mutual consent. =Harlequins= He was appointed Director of Rugby at Harlequins in May 2005 following their relegation from the Zurich Premiership in the 2004‚Äì05 season, and led them back to the Premiership at the first attempt, in a season where they lost only one league game. =Bloodgate= Richards resigned from Harlequins in August 2009 after an incident which became known as Bloodgate. He had orchestrated and had \\"central control\\" over a fake blood injury to Harlequins player Tom Williams to bring a more experienced replacement kicker onto the field during a Heineken Cup match against Leinster. With the game poised at 6-5 late in the second half, a successful penalty kick would have resulted in a place in the semifinals for Harlequins. Richards was found to have been involved in four similar incidents, and was banned from coaching for three seasons. Harlequins were fined ¬£259,000, and Williams was banned for four months. Harlequins' physiotherapist Steph Brennan was banned for two years. The doctor involved, Wendy Chapman, who cut the player's lip to try to cover up the incident, was reprimanded by the Medical Council, but escaped a ban. =Newcastle= In spring 2012 Richards was named Director of Rugby at Newcastle Falcons when his ban ended in August and, as he had with Harlequins, led Newcastle to promotion back to the Premiership at the first attempt. Richards led the Falcons to an 8th-place finish in the 2016-17 Aviva Premiership, with Falcons ending up just 3 points off the top 6. This was their best finish in 11 years, and their biggest number of wins in 15 years.

The full names of the principals in their practice, which went under various names during its life, are Edmund Sharpe (1809‚Äì77); Edward Graham Paley (1823‚Äì95), who practised as E. G. Paley; Hubert James Austin (1841‚Äì1915); Henry Anderson Paley (1859‚Äì1946), son of Edward, usually known as Harry Paley; and, for a very brief period, Geoffrey Langshaw Austin (1884‚Äì1971), son of Hubert. The firm's commissions were mainly for buildings in Lancashire and what is now Cumbria, but also in Yorkshire, Cheshire, the West Midlands, North Wales, and Hertfordshire. The practice specialised in work on churches; the design of new churches, restoring older churches, and making additions or alterations. They also designed country houses, and made alterations to existing houses. Almost all their churches were designed in Gothic Revival style, except for some of Sharpe's earliest churches and a few designed later by the practice. Within the Gothic Revival style, the practice initially used Early English and, particularly, Decorated features. E. G. Paley introduced Perpendicular elements, and Perpendicular became the dominant style used by the practice following the arrival of Hubert Austin, to such a degree that the firm became regarded as the regional leader in the use of that style. The practice used a greater variety of styles when working on country houses, including Elizabethan and Jacobean elements as well as Gothic. Other features were incorporated towards the end of the 19th century similar to those in works produced by the Aesthetic and the Arts and Crafts Movements. Not all the firm's work was on a large scale; as the major architectural practice in North West England they also undertook work on schools, vicarages, hospitals, factories, hotels, shops, railway stations, and war memorials. History and works During the life of the practice its title varied according to the names of the architects who ran it, either individually or in partnership. The history of the practice, and the works produced during each stage, are described under the titles used by the practice. As there are two periods when the practice worked under the title Austin and Paley, the relevant dates have been added to these headings. =Edmund Sharpe= Edmund Sharpe Edmund Sharpe established an architectural practice in his mother's house in Penny Street, Lancaster, in late 1835. He had received no formal training in architecture, gaining his knowledge from studying and drawing buildings during a tour of Germany and France between 1832 and 1835. In 1838 he moved his office to Sun Street, and that year Edward Paley, then aged 15, joined him as a pupil. The following year Sharpe moved his office again, this time to St Leonard's Gate. Sharpe's earliest commissions were for churches, the first being St Mark, Witton (1836‚Äì38), quickly followed by St Saviour's Church, Cuerden (1836‚Äì37). He then designed two small chapels, Holy Trinity, Howgill, and St John, Cowgill (both 1837‚Äì38), in what is now Cumbria. Larger and grander churches followed, including Christ Church, Walmsley (1839‚Äì40), and his largest church, Holy Trinity, Blackburn (1837‚Äì48). The latter was a Commissioners' church, so-called because it was partly financed by a grant from the Church Building Commissioners. In all, Sharpe designed six Commissioner's churches, including St George, Stalybridge (1838‚Äì40). In the early 1840s Sharpe gained a commission from the trustees of the Weaver Navigation to build three (or four) churches along its route for their employees. By 1842 he was designing his 31st church, including a long hoped for commission from the 13th Earl of Derby to design St Mary, Knowsley (1843‚Äì44). Sharpe was persuaded by his future brother-in-law John Fletcher, owner of Ladyshore Colliery, to experiment with the use of terracotta in the structure of his churches; not just for decoration, as had been done before, but for the whole structure of the church, other than the foundations and rubble infill. The churches resulting from this project were St Stephen and All Martyrs, Lever Bridge (1842‚Äì44), and Holy Trinity, Rusholme (1845‚Äì46). These were nicknamed by Sharpe himself as \\"the pot churches\\". Holy Trinity Church, Blackburn, (1837‚Äì48) Sharpe's largest church In addition to Edward Paley, Sharpe took on other pupils, some of whom later established their own architectural practices. One of these was Thomas Austin (1822‚Äì67), who joined Sharpe in 1841 and left in 1852 to set up his practice in Newcastle upon Tyne. Another pupil was John Douglas (1830‚Äì1911), who created a successful practice in Chester. Sharpe's architectural works were not limited to churches, nor was his practice confined to architecture. His most important architectural work in the domestic field was his remodelling of Capernwray Hall (1844‚Äì48), and in Knutsford he designed a house for the governor of the gaol (1844). In 1838 he was appointed as architect to what was then called the County Lunatic Asylum (later Lancaster Moor Hospital). Here, in addition to carrying out minor repairs, he added a chapel and six additional wings for the residents. Other duties in this post included work on Lancaster Castle and the Judges Lodgings. Sharpe's other business interests were in the field of engineering. By 1837 he had been appointed Bridgemaster for the South Lonsdale Hundred, in which role he cared for the roads and bridges in north Lancashire, including building at least two new bridges. He had also become involved with the development of railways in the region, initially by designing bridges and a viaduct for the Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway (now part of the West Coast Main Line). He was also becoming involved in the civic life of Lancaster, having been elected as a councillor in 1841. =Sharpe and Paley= Hornby Castle to which Sharpe and Paley made additions and alterations between 1847 and 1852 Sharpe appointed Paley as his partner in 1845, and then took an increasing interest in activities outside the practice. By 1847 Paley was responsible for most of the work in the practice, certainly carrying out independent commissions from at least 1849. In 1851, the year of Paley's marriage to Sharpe's youngest sister, Frances, Sharpe formally withdrew from the practice, although it continued to be known as Sharpe and Paley until 1856. Being the only major architect practising in the area between Preston and Carlisle, Paley took on commissions of all sizes and types but, like Sharpe, his major designs were for churches. Between 1851 and 1867 he designed or rebuilt about 36 new churches, almost all of them for the Church of England, with a small number for Congregationalists and Roman Catholics. Among his earlier churches were St Patrick, Preston Patrick (1852‚Äì53), St Anne, Thwaites (1853‚Äì54), and Christ Church, Bacup (1854). The first secular work undertaken during this period was the remodelling of Hornby Castle between 1847 and 1852, including its \\"expansive\\" symmetrical frontage. The next commission was the conversion of a manor house close to the ruins of Furness Abbey into the Furness Abbey Hotel starting in 1847. Other secular commissions around this time were for two vicarages and for the North Western Hotel in Morecambe (1847), and for work at Giggleswick School (1850‚Äì51). Paley also carried out work at Rossall School, including the chapel (1861‚Äì62), and the east range (1867). He designed new schools, including the Royal Grammar School in Lancaster (1851‚Äì52), and eight village schools. Paley's main domestic works were the rebuilding of Wennington Hall (1855‚Äì56), and a smaller house, The Ridding. Other varies commissions included the restoration of a music hall in Settle (1853), and cemetery buildings in Lancaster and Stalmine (1855 and 1856). The rapid growth of the town of Barrow-in-Furness, the construction of the Furness Railway following the discovery of deposits of iron ore in the Furness peninsular, and the development of industries using iron as a raw material resulted in many commissions for the practice. The population of Barrow doubled between 1851 and 1861, and doubled again in the next decade. The major figure in the development of the town and the railway was James Ramsden (1822‚Äì96), who eventually became managing director of the railway, the Barrow Haematite Steel Company, and the Barrow Shipbuilding Company. The largest deposits of iron ore had been discovered in about 1850 by Henry Schneider in land owned by William Cavendish, who was at that time the 2nd Earl of Burlington, and who also played a part in the industry. All three men commissioned the practice to design a variety of buildings. In addition Paley designed a country house, Abbot's Wood (1857‚Äì59) for Ramsden, a large and complex building with Gothic and Tudor features. =E. G. Paley= E. G. Paley Paley continued to work from the offices in St Leonard's Gate after Sharpe's resignation, but in 1860 he moved to offices in Castle Hill, where the practice remained throughout the rest of its existence. During the 1850s he designed St Peter, Lancaster, a Roman Catholic church that later became Lancaster Cathedral (1857‚Äì59). This is regarded by Brandwood et al. as his \\"masterwork as an independent church architect\\". Hartwell et al. agree, calling this church, with its northwest steeple high, his chef d'oeuvre. During the 1860s, Paley began to design churches with bare brick interior walls, rather than plastered walls, the earliest being St Peter, Quernmore (1860). Although the High Victorian style was becoming popular elsewhere, it played little part in Paley's designs, other than more elaborate decorative features, such as the embellishment of the principal rafters at Quernmore. He never used the more blatant features of the style, such as polychromy. During this decade, before the arrival of Austin, he designed churches for the industrial towns of Lancashire, one of the largest being St James, Poolstock (1863‚Äì66). The rebuilding of St Peter's Church, Bolton (1867‚Äì71) with its northwest tower rising to , is considered by Brandwood et al. to be \\"Paley's other great independent church project\\". Hartwell et al. refer to it as a \\"formidable new church\\". Secular commissions during this period included the restoration of the medieval tower at Dalton Castle (1859), and buildings for the Lancaster Carriage and Wagon Works (1864‚Äì65). The largest building designed by Paley, and indeed by the practice, was the Royal Albert Asylum (later renamed the Royal Albert Hospital which is currently named Jamea Al Kauthar Islamic College) in Lancaster (1868‚Äì73); it was in Gothic Revival style, and had an E-shaped plan. It has a central French-type tower, with a steeply pitched pyramidal roof flanked by pinnacles. Paley designed stations for the Furness Railway, starting with the Strand Station in Barrow (1863); he probably also designed the station at Grange- over-Sands (1866). Overlooking the latter town he designed the Grange Hotel (1866). =Paley and Austin= Hubert Austin On 28 January 1867 Hubert Austin joined Paley in the practice as a partner. He was the half-brother of Thomas Austin, who had been a pupil of Sharpe. Hubert Austin had worked for three years in the office of George Gilbert Scott, and before he joined the Lancaster practice had designed Christ Church, Ashford, Kent (1855‚Äì56). Following his arrival, the work of the practice continued much as before, with both ecclesiastical and secular commissions. Ecclesiastical works Two early large churches in industrial areas in Lancashire were built in 1869‚Äì71: St Chad, Kirkby, and St John the Evangelist, Cheetham. Pollard describes St Chad as one of the partnership's \\"most powerful churches\\", Brandwood et al. consider that St John the Evangelist is the practice's \\"most important church in Manchester. These were followed by the rebuilding, other than the tower, of St Mary, Leigh (1871‚Äì73), in which the Perpendicular style, generally unfashionable at the time, was used throughout. Similarly the body of All Saints' Church, Daresbury (1870‚Äì72) was rebuilt in Perpendicular style. Meanwhile the practice was designing new churches or rebuilding old churches for villages in the countryside. Some of these were small, others larger and more impressive, such as St Peter, Finsthwaite (1873‚Äì74) and St Peter, Scorton (1878‚Äì79). In 1872‚Äì73 the partners built their only new church in Wales, St Mary, Betws-y-Coed. This was followed by an estate church, St John the Evangelist (1882‚Äì84) at Walton, south of Warrington, and by the rebuilding of the old parish church of St Mary (1884‚Äì85) at Dalton-in-Furness. St Mary's Church, Dalton-in-Furness, (1884‚Äì85) a new church with chequerwork decoration They also designed about 23 urban churches of varying sizes and styles. Most were in the industrial towns of Lancashire, except for St John the Evangelist, Greenock (1877‚Äì78) in Scotland, a mission chapel in Scarborough, North Yorkshire (1885), and St Barnabas (1884‚Äì85) in the railway town of Crewe, Cheshire. Notable among the Lancashire urban churches are St Matthew and St James, Mossley Hill, Liverpool (1870‚Äì75), described by Pollard as \\"one of the best Victorian churches in Liverpool, St Michael and All Angels, Howe Bridge, Atherton (1875‚Äì77), considered by Pollard to be one of Paley and Austin's \\"most stimulating churches\\", and St John the Baptist, also in Atherton (1878‚Äì79), of which Pollard says \\"The whole is monumental, one of Paley and Austin's best\\", with a tower that is \\"magnificently mighty\\". In Astley Bridge, Bolton, they built two churches, which are described by Hartwell et al. as being \\"remarkable\\"; these were All Souls (1878‚Äì81), which is now redundant, and St Saviour (1882‚Äì85), which was demolished in 1975. St James, Daisy Hill, Westhoughton (1879‚Äì81) is considered by Hartwell et al. as \\"a masterly performance for relatively little cash\\", and St Peter, Westleigh Leigh (1879‚Äì81) is described by Pollard as one of Paley and Austin's \\"most radical and thrilling churches\\". Meanwhile, in rapidly growing Barrow, they had built four smaller churches to a common design, each dedicated to one of the Four Evangelists. In 1884 the partnership submitted plans for a new Anglican cathedral in Liverpool. Their plan was placed in the top twelve, but failed to make the next round of the competition. In the event the project was abandoned in 1888, the cathedral being built later and on a different site. Secular works Walton Hall, near Warrington, to which Paley and Austin made alterations in 1870 Meanwhile, the town of Barrow was continuing to grow, and this resulted in many commissions for the practice. In order to deal with this they opened a sub-office in the town, run by John Harrison (1837‚Äì96), which continued to exist until the late 1880s. The first major commission in the town was to design a flax and jute mill for James Ramsden (1870‚Äì72). Other secular buildings included banks, cemetery buildings (including a large gateway), ten large tenement blocks, schools, villas, meeting halls, and the School of Art. For the Furness Railway they designed stations, goods sheds, workers' cottages and, probably, the circular water tower at Seascale. The partners were also involved with work at large country houses. The most important commission was to build a new wing at Holker Hall in 1871‚Äì75 to replace a wing severely damaged by fire; this was the largest project undertaken by the partners. The next major country house commission was the restoration of Hoghton Tower (1876‚Äì78) for Sir Henry de Hoghton. Other work on country houses included building Sedgwick House (1868‚Äì69), adding an extension to Leighton Hall (1870), making extensions to Walton Hall (1870), Underley Hall (1872), Capernwray Hall (1875‚Äì76), and Whittington Hall (1887). New houses included Oak Lea for Henry Schneider (1874, since demolished), Witherslack Hall (1874), and Hampsfield House (1880‚Äì82). Their last major work on a country house was the remodelling of Thurland Castle (1879‚Äì85) following severe damage by fire. The practice continued to design new schools, and in the 1870s they began to design new buildings for Sedbergh School, creating an association with the school that was to produce commissions throughout the remaining life of the practice. =Paley, Austin and Paley= St George's Church, Heaviley, Stockport, (1892‚Äì97) considered to be Hubert Austin's finest church In 1886 Edward Paley's son, Henry (who was and is usually known as Harry), became a partner in the practice, which continued to work much as before, with ecclesiastical and secular commissions. New churches were built in villages and towns, and older churches were restored or altered. The first new country church resulting from the partnership was the Church of the Good Shepherd, Tatham (1888‚Äì89). Brandwood et al. describe the 1890s as \\"something of a golden decade for the firm's country churches\\". The first of these was St Bartholomew, Barbon (1892‚Äì93), mainly Perpendicular in style, but with some rounded arches, followed by St Peter, Field Broughton (1892‚Äì94), also in Perpendicular style. Smaller churches were St Mary, Borwick (1894‚Äì96) (Perpendicular again), and a mission church seating 150 at Sunderland Point (1894). The 1890s was also a prolific period for new town churches but, before the start of that decade, the firm had designed St Mary, Ince-in-Makerfield (1887, demolished 1974), St John, Birkdale (1899‚Äì90), and St John, Cloughfold, in Rawtenstall (1899‚Äì90, now redundant). Major town churches of the first half of the 1890s include St John, Crawshawbooth (1890‚Äì92), and Christ Church, Waterloo (near Liverpool) (1891‚Äì99). During this time the partnership produced their only church in the south of England, All Saints, Hertford (1893‚Äì95). Brandwood et al. say that it is a \\"Perpendicular building entirely characteristic of the firm\\" but, being built in Runcorn sandstone from Cheshire, Pevsner considered that it was \\"completely alien in Herts\\". This period also saw the finest church design to be executed by the practice, St George, Heaviley in Stockport (1892‚Äì97), which is considered to be the solely the work of Austin. Brandwood et al. describe it as \\"the largest, grandest and most expensive church the practice ever built and is the masterwork of Hubert Austin\\". Hartwell et al. say it is \\"a church on a splendid scale\\". Another ecclesiastical project was the chapel at the Royal Albert Asylum (1886‚Äì80). During this time much less work was carried out in the secular sphere. There were no new substantial country houses designed during this time, the largest being the \\"rather plain, four-square\\" Hampsfield House. The only major public buildings were the Storey Institute (1887‚Äì91) in Lancaster, and the Lancaster Royal Infirmary (1893‚Äì96). Work was carried out on school buildings, including extensions at Lancaster Royal Grammar School and Christ Church School, Lancaster (both 1887), and a new building for the Keswick School of Industrial Art (1893‚Äì94). Commercial buildings included shops for the Lancaster and Skerton Cooperative Society, including a large store in the middle of Lancaster. =Austin and Paley= 1895‚Äì1914 St Mary's Church, Widnes (1908‚Äì10) Edward Paley died on 23 January 1895 at the age of 71, and the remaining partners continued the practice under the title Austin and Paley. It is not clear how much Edward Paley had been contributing to the work of the practice in his later years; it is likely that by then Austin had been \\"the chief creative force\\". The church commissions continued much as before, particularly with new churches, and also with church restorations. New country churches included St Mark, Dolphinholme (1897‚Äì98), St Luke, Slyne (1898‚Äì1900), and St John, Flookburgh (1897‚Äì1900), the last of which incorporated Romanesque features. After 1900 the practice designed All Saints, Barnacre (1905‚Äì06), St John, Ellel (1906‚Äì07), and St Mark, Natland (1909‚Äì10). There were many new town churches, including St Barnabas, Morecambe (1898‚Äì1900), St John the Divine, Sandylands (1898‚Äì1901) (also in Morecambe), St Anne, Hindsford (1898‚Äì1901 now redundant), and St Thomas, St Anne's-on-the- Sea (1899‚Äì1900). These were followed in the 20th century by new churches including St Michael, Middleton (1901‚Äì02), St Mary, Walney (1907‚Äì08), St Andrew, Starbeck, Harrogate (1909‚Äì10), and St Margaret, Halliwell, Bolton (1911‚Äì13). Brandwood et al. describe two further buildings as the partnership's \\"last two major urban churches\\". The first of these is St Michael and All Angels, Ashton-on-Ribble, Preston (1906‚Äì08). The other, described as the partners' \\"last great masterpiece\\" is St Mary, Widnes (1908‚Äì10). Further ecclesiastical works were the chapels built for Sedbergh School (1895‚Äì97) and for St Bees' School (1906). Although church work dominated the work of the practice there were also some secular commissions. There was no work on country houses during this period, nor were there any commissions for public buildings, other than an expansion of the Storey Institute (1906‚Äì08). The last public building designed by the partnership was Hornby Village Institute (1914). In the commercial field the firm designed workshops and a showroom for William Atkinson, which were among the earliest motor garages and showrooms in the provinces. The practice continued to carry out work for the Lancaster and Skerton Cooperative Society, designing numerous shops in the local area. The partners also carried out work on schools, in particular for Sedbergh School. They designed an extension to Leeds Grammar School (1904‚Äì05), Llandovery College, North Wales (1901‚Äì03), Shrewsbury School (1913‚Äì14), and extra buildings for St Bees School, Rossall School, and the Clergy Daughters' School at Casterton (1896). Austin, Paley and Austin Hubert Austin's eldest son, Bernard Tate (1873‚Äì1955), studied architecture in the firm, but had a disagreement with his father and left in 1902 to work as an architect for Lever Brothers. Austin's youngest son, Geoffrey Langshaw (1884‚Äì1971), also worked with the practice from 1907, and was made a junior partner in January 1914, when the practice became known as Austin, Paley and Austin. However the partnership was short-lived as Geoffrey enlisted to serve in the King's Own Royal Lancaster Regiment in February 1915. He saw active service in the First World War, leaving the army in 1919, but did not return to the practice, nor did he continue with an architectural career. 1915‚Äì44 All Saints Church, Becconsall (1925‚Äì26) Hubert Austin died on 22 March 1915 leaving Harry Paley as the sole principal, but the practice continued to be known as Austin and Paley. Helped by assistants and clerks Paley continued to work until the 1940s, but without appointing another partner. He continued to work on churches, repairing and restoring older churches, and designing new ones. His new churches include All Saints, Becconsall (1925‚Äì26), St Stephen on-the-Cliffs, Blackpool (1925‚Äì27), St Hilda, Bilsborrow (1926‚Äì27), St Luke, Orrell (1927‚Äì28 and 1938), St Stephen, Whelley (1928‚Äì30 and 1937‚Äì38), St Barbara, Earlsdon, Coventry (1930‚Äì31), St Thomas, Blackpool (1930‚Äì32), and his last church, St John, Abram (1935‚Äì37). A major source of commissions following the First World War was the design of war memorials and monuments. Two of Paley's war memorials are considered to be sufficiently notable to have been designated as Grade II listed buildings. They are both in villages in Cumbria, Beetham and Great Salkeld, both in sandstone in the form of a Celtic cross, and were constructed in or about 1919. Work continued to be carried out at Sedbergh, Giggleswick, and Leeds Grammar Schools, and on the Royal Lancaster Infirmary. The practice continued to be active until the 1940s. It is uncertain when Harry Paley retired, and it is possible that some work was carried out by his assistants after his retirement. The practice had certainly closed by 1945, when the offices were sold to Lancaster Corporation and the records of the firm were destroyed. Harry Paley died on 19 April 1946. Architectural styles St Mark's Church, Blackburn, (1836‚Äì38) a Romanesque church by Sharpe Sharpe's first three churches were in Romanesque style, as according to Sharpe \\"no style can be worked so cheap as Romanesque\\". He then started to include Gothic features, which often did not accurately reflect the features to be found in medieval churches, being an approximation rather than an accurate (or \\"correct\\") representation. Influenced by A. W. N. Pugin (1812‚Äì52) and the Cambridge Camden Society (later named the Ecclesiological Society), of which Sharpe was a member, he introduced more \\"correct\\" Gothic features into his designs, which he continued to use throughout the rest of his career. In 1844 he was praised by the society for his design of the new steeple at St Michael, Kirkham (1843‚Äì44), which was described as being \\"beautiful and correct\\". Almost all of Paley's designs were in Gothic Revival style, mainly reflecting features of the 13th and early 14th centuries, with open roofs, benches for the congregation, stalls for the choir, the pulpit to the side of the entrance to the chancel, steps leading up to the chancel, and no side chapels. Most of the designs were largely in the Decorated style, although Paley did occasionally introduce 15th-century Perpendicular features, for example in his rebuilding of St Patrick, Preston Patrick (1852‚Äì53). During the 1850s Paley introduced what was to become one of his favourite features, the traceried oculus window, in Christ Church, Bacup (1854) and St James, Wrightington (1857). St Mary the Virgin's Church, Leigh, the body being rebuilt in Perpendicular style by Paley and Austin in 1871‚Äì73 During the Paley and Austin partnership, the architectural styles used by the practice changed and developed. In church architecture, Paley had already started to introduce Perpendicular features in some of his designs, and this trend was to continue and increase after the arrival of Austin. Throughout their partnership, the designs for churches were mainly in Gothic Revival style. After the arrival of Austin, there was much greater use of Perpendicular features. Brandwood et al. see the practice as national pioneers in this trend, saying \\"the firm can be seen as a true pioneer in the rehabilitation of Perpendicular architecture after its ecclesiological exile for a quarter of a century\\". Early examples of what the authors consider to be part of what they call \\"the Perpendicular revival in the North\\" are the rebuilding of the bodies of St Mary, Leigh, (1871‚Äì73) and All Saints, Daresbury (1870‚Äì72). The Perpendicular \\"would become the stock-in- trade style for some of the most admired buildings as the years rolled on\\". However they did continue to use features from the Early English and Decorated styles, sometimes together in the same church, as in New St Leonard, Langho. Away from the Gothic Revival style, Norman or Norman transitional features were occasionally used, as in St Mary, Betws-y-Coed (1872‚Äì73), and St Peter, Finsthwaite (1873‚Äì74). Brandwood et al identify two other, potentially incompatible, stylistic changes in the firm's designs during this period. The first is what they describe as \\"a greater muscularity ...at times accompanied by continental overtones\\". Examples are in the restoration of the tower of St Peter, Heversham, (1868‚Äì70) and in the new church of St Mary, Walton, Cumbria (1869‚Äì70). The other stylistic factor was the use of \\"gentler, less ornate\\" motifs taken from the Aesthetic Movement, or motifs that could \\"pass muster as proto-Arts & Crafts work\\". Features \\"verging on Art Nouveau\\" are present in window tracery in All Saints, St Helens, and on the gate-piers outside St George, Heaviley. What became a \\"favourite feature\\" for Austin and Paley were carved inscriptions, usually black, sometimes in Latin and sometimes in English; examples can be in St John, Crawshawbooth, and Christ Church, Waterloo (both in Merseyside). In their secular commissions the practice used a variety of styles. Their new wing at Holker Hall was in Elizabethan style, as were the additions to Underley Hall. Witherslack Hall has Jacobean detailing, while other country houses, such as Sedgwick House, incorporate Gothic features. Thurland Castle has features of both Elizabethan and late Gothic styles. Motifs taken from the Aesthetic Movement can be found in both the exterior and the interior of their new wing at Holker Hall, and from the Arts and Crafts Movement in the interior of Thurland Castle. Patrons Revd John William Whittaker, Sharpe's early patron Sir James Ramsden, Barrow-in- Furness businessman and patron of the practice Sharpe's earliest commissions were promoted by his older cousin Revd J. W. Whitaker, vicar of Blackburn. Whittaker had connections with major figures in the Church of England and members of the aristocracy. Sharpe's work came to the notice of the Bishop of Chester, Rt Rev John Bird Sumner, whose diocese at that time included Lancashire as well as Cheshire. He was a member of the Church Building Commission, and it is likely that he played a part in Sharpe's involvement in designing Commissioners' Churches. Family connections led to an association with the Greenall family, brewers in Warrington, which possibly led to the commission for the series of churches along the Weaver Navigation. Sharpe had hoped to gain commissions from the Earl of Derby, but was successful only in his design for St Mary, Knowsley. The relationship the practice developed with the major entrepreneurs in Barrow-in-Furness, James Ramsden, and Henry Schneider, resulted in the many commissions for buildings in the town and for the Furness Railway. Practice organisation and personalities As the office records have been destroyed there is no detailed account of how the office was run, or how the partners related to each other in business matters. Sharpe was a man of many interests and talents. In addition to him being an entrepreneur, establishing a practice that lasted for more than 100 years, he was a railway engineer and developer, a public figure who pioneered sanitary reform in Lancaster. He was also an accomplished sportsman and musician. Edward Paley also took an active part in the civil life of Lancaster, while Hubert Austin had a more retiring personality, concentrating more on his work in the practice and with his family. By the time Harry Paley came to run the practice alone there was less work available. As he was relatively comfortable financially, he was also able to take part in the life of the town and in his sporting interests. All the principals were Anglicans, and most of the church commissions came from the Church of England. Sharpe, in particular, had low church sympathies, and most of the commissions throughout the life of the practice were for the churches of low church or middle-of the-road patrons. This was consistent with the state of Anglicanism generally in Lancashire, possibly a reaction against the strong presence of Catholicism in the county. Henry Austin was a keen churchman, and was a churchwarden for many years. Nevertheless, the practice did design churches and other buildings for Catholics, Congregationalists and Presbyterians. Appraisal The firm was a \\"provincial architectural practice\\" in the strict use of the term; sited as it was in a town some distance from any major city. Its output was almost entirely in North West England, particularly in Lancashire and in the southern part of what is now Cumbria. Nevertheless, the practice did achieve national recognition, especially in the later part of the 19th century, and in particular for its churches. A contemporary opinion of the practice was given by the German architect and critic Hermann Muthesius who was present in England between 1896 and 1904. He commented on English architecture and architects, and in his book Die neuere kirchliche Baukunst in England (1901) he placed the works of Austin and Paley on a par with Bodley and Garner, James Brooks, J. D. Sedding, Norman Shaw, and George Gilbert Scott, junior. He was particularly impressed by St Peter, Lancaster, and by the village churches designed by the practice. Writing in 1969 the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner said \\"this Lancaster dynasty of architects did more work in the county, and for a time more outstanding work, than any other\\". Referring to the late Victorian churches designed by the practice, Pevsner stated that they were \\"of the highest European standard of their years\\". Of the partners, Pevsner had highest regard for Hubert Austin, whom he called a \\"genius\\", saying that it was he \\"it seems, who was responsible for the firm's masterpieces\\". The title of the introduction to the book by Brandwood et al. entitled The Architecture of Sharpe, Paley and Austin is \\"A practice like no other\\".

Wilson performed and recorded in the classic female blues style in the 1920s, and worked in vaudeville and stage productions, first in her native Louisville, Kentucky, and later throughout the US and abroad. From the 1930s onward, she acted in radio plays and television, and from 1948 to 1966 represented the Aunt Jemima brand for Quaker Oats in personal appearances and on television. She remained an active performer until 1980. Biography Wilson as Aunt Jemima in a 1956 appearance at the Seattle Kiwanis Club Pancake Festival She was born Edith Goodall on September 2, 1896, in Louisville, Kentucky, to Susan Jones and Hundley Goodall. (Her birthdate is often stated as ten years later, but this was due to vanity.) Her first professional experience came in 1919 in Louisville's Park Theater. The singer Lena Wilson and her brother, Danny, performed in Louisville; she joined their act. Edith was married to Danny Wilson from 1921 until his death in 1928. Danny, a pianist who had been trained at a conservatory in Charleston, South Carolina, encouraged Lena and Edith to sing not just blues but also other song forms.Wintz, Cary D.; Finkelman, Paul (2004). Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance. Vol. 1. Taylor & Francis. p. 163. . Together the trio performed on the East Coast in 1920‚Äì1921, and when they were in New York City Wilson was signed by Columbia, which recorded her in 1921 with Johnny Dunn's Jazz Hounds. She recorded 17 songs with Dunn in 1921 and 1922. In 1924 she worked with Fletcher Henderson in New York, where she was slated to sing with Coleman Hawkins, but Hawkins refused to perform because he wanted additional compensation. She remained a popular Columbia artist through 1925. Wilson recorded far less than other female blues stars of the 1920s like Bessie Smith. After Wilson left Columbia in 1925, she recorded one record for Brunswick in 1929 and a handful of sides for Victor in 1930. She remained a nightclub and theater singer, working for years on the New York entertainment scene. She sang with Florence Mills in the Lew Leslie Plantation Review in Harlem. She also made several trips to England, where she was well received. She sang with The Hot Chocolates revue, performing alongside Louis Armstrong and Fats Waller, and made appearances with Bill Robinson, Duke Ellington, Alberta Hunter, Cab Calloway, and Noble Sissle. Wilson did extensive work as an actress, appearing on radio in The Great Gildersleeve, on radio and television in Amos 'n' Andy, and on film in To Have and Have Not (1944). She also performed with the United Service Organizations (USO) on US military bases during World War II. She met Millard Wilson, serendipitously with the same last name, and they married in 1947. In 1948, Wilson became the face of Aunt Jemima. She was the first Aunt Jemima to appear in television commercials. Wilson received the Key to the City of Albion, Michigan, on January 25, 1964. Throughout this period, the NAACP and other civil rights organizations campaigned against racist portrayals of African-American life. Although \\"her appearance as Aunt Jemima on early commercials was criticized as demeaning\\", she was proud of what she considered the aura of dignity she brought to the character. Quaker Oats ended local appearances for Aunt Jemima in 1965, and ended her employment in 1966. In 1963, Wilson became executive secretary for the Negro Actors Guild, and was involved with the National Association of Negro Musicians into the '70s. Wilson made a comeback in 1973 to play with Eubie Blake, Little Brother Montgomery, and Terry Waldo. Her last live show was at the 1980 Newport Jazz Festival. Wilson died in Chicago on March 31, 1981. References External links * *Stuart A.

He is best known for his historical painting of the Constituent Assembly at Eidsvoll (Riksforsamlingen p√• Eidsvoll 1814). Two of his paintings are held in the National Gallery of Norway. Family His parents were Sverre Nicolai Wergeland (1817‚Äì1896) and Anne Margrethe Larsen (1817‚Äì1889). His sister was Agnes Mathilde Wergeland (1857‚Äì1914), who emigrated to the United States and became known as an author. He was the great-nephew of Nicolai Wergeland, a priest, writer, and politician, and a member of the Norwegian Constituent Assembly at Eidsvoll. Hence Henrik Wergeland, Camilla Collett, and Joseph Frantz Oscar Wergeland were cousins of his father. Biography Riksforsamlingen p√• Eidsvoll 1814 (1885) Wergeland was born in Oslo, Norway. Several of his siblings died early, and his father went to America around 1860. He was a student of David Arnesen (1818‚Äì1895) during 1859 and of the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry from 1865 to 1867. He also attended the art school operated by Johan Fredrik Eckersberg (1822‚Äì1870) from 1865 to 1869. He was a student at the Copenhagen art academy in 1869. He studied history painting in Munich 1874 - 1876, and lived in Munich until 1889. From 1889 he was teaching at the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry in Kristiania. The painting Riksforsamlingen p√• Eidsvoll 1814 was probably begun in 1882. Wergeland copied well over 60 portrait to get the result as credible as possible. The picture includes 55 portraits of the constitutional fathers. (Not all of the 112 persons are viewable.)

The Hand drill is a hieroglyph, (and tool), used in ancient Egypt from the earliest dynasties. As a hieroglyph, it can also be used as a determinative for words related to the profession of vase, bowl, pot-making, etc., typically from fine-grained, colorful rare stone, for example unguent jars. The size of drills was small-to-large, small for small unguent jars, and large for more massive, grain-storing pottery. The original jars found in tombs were more often used for ceremonial usages, presumably the reason they are found as grave goods or tomb offerings. Hand drill hieroglyph and tool explanation The hand drill was a vertical type of weighted, and counterbalanced boring bar, (used today in horizontal lathe-work boring, for example: rifle tubes). The hieroglyph shows the weights used as pictured on temple reliefs; the weight of the stones does the tool work, and the artisan simply supplies the rotational motion of the tool, for boring the hole. Of note: with the weighted device, the Egyptians were performing a lathe operation long before the invention. Instead of the lathe-(massive metal: weight and forces) doing the work, essentially the Egyptians were using a form of a vertical lathe-using gravity-weights, with the boring bar doing the cutting.

This permits larger, but not necessarily longer, strings to fit within the case of the piano.A short history of the development of the piano , Dartmouth College The invention of cross-stringing in the 1820s is variously credited to Alpheus BabcockPiano History, www.concertpitchpiano.comA Short History of the Piano by Alphonse Gunther and Jean-Henri Pape.Piano History , www.ukpianos.co.uk The first patented use in grand pianos in the United States was by Henry Steinway Jr. in 1859.Alistair Riddell Towards a virtual piano action, NMA Magazine (1988)A Brief History of the Piano, www.shafferpianos.com In the late 19th century, cross-stringing gradually took the place of straight-stringing, in which all the strings are perpendicular to the keyboard and do not overlap. The advantages of cross- stringing is that the case of the piano can be smaller, the bass strings can be longer and the placement of the bass strings is in the center of the piano case, where they receive more resonance than when placed at the side.A Guide to Piano Buying , www.pianoworld.comCross-Strung or Straight-Strung piano? , www.thepianoworkshop.co.zaAdvice , www.pianomanpianos.co.uk Cross-stringing is criticized by some as producing a \\"murky\\" sound. According to the pianist Gwendolyn Mok, \\"If you look inside your own piano, you will notice that the strings are all crossing each other. With the straight strung piano you get distinct registral differences--almost like listening to a choir where you have the bass, tenor, alto, and soprano voices. It is very clear and there is no blending or homogenizing of the sound.\\"Gwendolyn Mok in Conversation with Thad Carhart , www.gwendolynmok.com Some Challen pianos made on the 1920s are \\"double overstrung\\", where the strings are at 3 different heights and cross over in 2 different locations.

Whitaker (July 23, 1921 ‚Äì October 16, 2007) was an American minister, professor, psychologist, sociologist, writer and World War II army veteran. A Baptist minister, Whitaker was the first African-American to graduate from the Harvard Divinity School in (1952), as well as the first African-American to be appointed as an executive minister within the American Baptist Churches USA, a position he held from 1978‚Äì1983. Early life and military service Born and raised in Massachusetts, Whitaker was a National Honor Society graduate at Malden High School, where he also participated in marching band, student government and various sports including track and field, where he held the record for the 100m dash for over 50 years. After his graduation, Whitaker was drafted into the United States Army on March 5, 1943. In the army he was the band leader and first trumpet for the Ninth Cavalry Army band. After serving for three years he was honorably discharged as a technical sergeant (January 12, 1946). He received four battle stars for tours in Tunisia, Naples, Foggia, Rhineland and Central Europe under General Patton. Along with these he was also awarded with the Good Conduct Medal, the Victory Medal and the European African Middle Eastern Theater Campaign Ribbon. Ministry and beyond Upon returning to the United States, Reverend Whitaker married Virginia A. Carter in 1948, and together they had four sons, Ronald, Paul, Mark and Keith. After graduating from Harvard Divinity School where he earned his S.T.D. (doctorate in sacred theology), he went on to get his S.T.M. (masters in sacred theology) from Andover Newton Theological School (1954). Following college, Whitaker moved his family to Rochester, NY where he served as a minister at the Mt. Olivet Baptist Church, and taught sociology at the University of Rochester. During the Reverend's time here while the nation was immersed in the Civil Rights Movement he wrote the thesis Anatomy of a Riot documenting the Rochester 1964 race riot, which was put into the National Congressional Record soon after it was written. For a short time after, the Reverend and his family moved to St. Paul, MN where he was the minister at the Pilgrim Baptist Church founded by escaped slaves in 1863. When this tour was over he moved his family back to Boston, MA. Here he started work for the American Baptist Churches of Massachusetts as an associate minister stationed at the Tremont Temple. In 1973 he received his doctorate degree from Andover Newton Theological and Missions College in Ministry and became certified as a licensed psychologist in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The American Baptist Churches of New York called Whitaker back in 1978 to serve as the executive minister, which he did until 1983. He had the honor of being the first African-American to be appointed as executive minister within The American Baptist Churches of America. In 1984 the Reverend moved to Randolph, MA permanently where he began teaching and counseling at Harvard Divinity School. Retiring in 2001, at 80 years of age, he continued his psychology practice and served as an interim minister at various churches in the greater Boston area. Throughout his lifetime as a minister and teacher he published many articles in magazines and newspapers. His name was entered in \\"Who's Who in The East, \\"Who's Who in America\\", \\"Who's Who Among Black Americans\\" and \\"Who's Who in Religion\\" throughout the 1960s and 1980s. He continued his ministry and counseling via hospitals and churches until his death in 2007.

Online video Online video is video content distributed by the Internet. Recently, several different studies have shown that, at least in the United States, online video reaches a majority of the population. This is due in part to the penetration of broadband internet, and also to the emergence of highly successful video portals. These portals offer user created or professionally created content. The majority of online videos are shorter than 5 minutes in duration, a length generally preferred by users who view such content on computers or portable equipment, like cellphones, MP3 players or video game consoles. Some portals offer videos in the 320x240 pixel resolution, while others opt for a larger format, such as 480x360 pixels (for a typical display) and 640x360 (for a widescreen 16:9 display). Many portals use Adobe Flash Player for their videos, the player which is becoming a de facto industry standard. Others use Windows Media Player, QuickTime, DivX Web Player or RealPlayer. Devices like Apple TV or Netgear's Digital Entertainer, capable of transferring video files from the Internet to the television screen, will cause an increase in the length of the size of videos, both in definition and duration. Most video portals generate their revenue through advertising.

To the right of the stone formation, the two runestones can be seen, and in the background there is the lake. The stone formation. Arkils tingstad (\\"Assembly location of Arkil\\") is the remains of the Viking Age thing or assembly location of a hundred in Uppland, Sweden. It is situated on the outskirts of Stockholm. The remains consist of a rectangular stone formation and two runestones. The runestones and the assembly location were created by the Sk√•lhamra clan who also had the two Risbyle Runestones made across the lake near their estate. It consequently appears that they owned land on both sides of the lake.A presentation on the website of the Stockholm County Museum They also made the runestone U 100 at a path in the forest. Scholars disagree on the function of a Viking Age assembly location. According to one view, all the people in the vicinity assembled there in order to reach agreements and to mete out justice. Another view sees the assemblies as meetings for the chieftains only who merely stated what they had decided to do and where they interrogated and punished their subordinates. Before the Christianization of Scandinavia, the pagan bl√≥ts were performed by chieftains and magnates. When Christianity arrived, the Christian rites and especially baptism were central to the community. It is possible that the Sk√•lhamra clan created the assembly location in order to have settlements around the lake baptized by priests from Sigtuna. The inscriptions suggest that the location had no continuity from Norse paganism. Based on the styles of the inscriptions, the assembly location was created in the 1010s, and the runestones are some decades older than the Jarlabanke runestone U 212 which tells of the creation of another assembly location. Runestones Below follows a presentation of the runestones based on information collected from the Rundata project, organized according to location. The transcriptions from runic inscriptions into standardized Old Norse are in the Swedish and Danish dialect to facilitate comparison with the inscriptions, while the English translation provided by Rundata give the names in standard dialect (the Icelandic and Norwegian dialect). =U 225= U 225. A reading of the U 225 runestone's text in Old East Norse. The two runestones constitute a twin monument such that the text on U 225 is to be read as continuing on U 226. p. 202. Both runestones were carved by a runemaster with the normalized name of Gunnar, with U 225 classified as being in runestone style RAK. This is the classification for inscriptions with a runic text has no dragon or serpent heads and the ends of the runic bands are straight.

A reading of the U 226 runestone's text in Old East Norse. This runestone was also made by Gunnar and is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr1. This is the classification, which is also known as Ringerike style, for those inscriptions that have runic bands that end in serpent or animal heads depicted in profile. In the text there is some question regarding whether the Old Norse words i grati should be translated as meaning \\"in tears\\" or \\"in lament,\\" meaning that Gyr√≠√∞r composed poetry in mourning her deceased husband. It has been suggested that the inscription Vg 59 in Norra H√§rene describes another widow who may have composed a lament. U 226 is the only surviving runestone signed by Gunnar, although more than forty other inscriptions have been attributed to him based on stylistic analysis. The runes kunar ik stin for \\"Gunnarr cut the stone\\" are carved in a line below the rest of the inscription.

After two years in business, Keller Williams became the largest single office residential real estate firm in Austin with 72 licensed agents.

Life  Evans was born at Maesymynach, a farm in the parish of Llanfihangel Ystrad, Cardiganshire. He was the second of three sons born to a farmer, David Evans. Daniel Evans attended the grammar school in Lampeter, where he was taught by Eliezer Williams, before attending Jesus College, Oxford. He matriculated in 1810, and obtained degrees of B.A. (1814), M.A. (1817) and B.D. (1824). In 1817, he was elected by the college to a fellowship, which he held until his death in 1846, but he resided mainly in Wales. Although Evans was ordained, he came to public attention as a poet rather than as a priest. He served briefly as chaplain of the Royal Military Asylum in Northampton, but resigned due to ill-health and returned home to his parents in Wales. He had no clerical appointments thereafter. In 1819, he was involved with the Dyfed Cambrian Society's attempt to revive the eisteddfod, and was also elected as poet to the London-based Gwyneddigion Society. Four years later, in 1823, he won two major poetry prizes at the Carmarthen Eisteddfod, one for ' and the other for '. He had a particular skill for love and nature poetry. His collected works were published in 1830 under the title ', with an expanded second edition in 1872 drawing on unpublished sources; a third edition was published in 1906. He wrote in classical forms as well as in modern style. Whilst Evans did write a few poems in English, these are regarded as of lesser merit than his Welsh poems. Though highly regarded in the nineteenth century, his reputation has fallen in later times. Evans, who suffered from depression, committed suicide in Maesnewydd, Llanwnnen, Cardiganshire on 28 March 1846, and was buried on 1 April 1846 at Pencarreg, Carmarthenshire.  Works  Evans's writings included: * ' (1810) * ' (1819?) (a poem trying to persuade John Jones (Tegid) to remain in Wales rather than travel to the East Indies) * ' (1820) * ' (1822) * ' (1826) * ' (1826) * ' (1841) * ' (1845) * ' won Evans a silver medal and prize, presented by Thomas Beynon, a fellow poet, who was president of the Carmarthen Society of Cymreigyddion.

The house dates from 1760 and its design is attributed to Peter Harrison, a prominent architect of the period, responsible also for the Touro Synagogue and the Redwood Library, both important early Newport buildings. In 1975 the house was added to the National Register of Historic Places. History The building was constructed \\"in 1760 as a private residence for Colonel Francis Malbone (1728 - 1785), who made his fortune as a shipping merchant at a time when Newport Harbor was one of the busiest Harbors in the New World. He is believed to have smuggled merchandise into the house to avoid taxes. Subterranean passages found in the cellar have been traced to a subway leading to the pier where Colonel Malbone moored his fleet. This was a practice common in the Free Port of Newport, and one upon which many Newport fortunes were founded.\\"\\"History of our Inn\\" 21 June 2008. The British occupied Newport during the American Revolution \\"and seized the Malbone Estate. The mansion was used to store looted gold and treasures, leading to its nickname, \\"the treasure house.\\"\\" After the American Revolution, \\"the mansion was returned to the Malbone family who retained ownership until the early 1830s. After the death of Colonel Malbone in 1785, his son, also named Francis Malbone, who later became United States Senator, owned the estate until his death in 1809. In 1770, famed painter, Gilbert Stuart painted the portrait of the younger Francis Malbone and his brother Saunders, which now hangs in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.\\" In the early 1800s, prior to the building of the famous mansions on Bellevue Avenue, the Malbone House was one of the most opulent houses in Newport. It was owned from 1833 to 1838 by Colonel Joseph G. Totten of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. At that time, Colonel Totten was in charge of construction of Fort Adams and was also the senior Army engineer in the northeast. He sold the house in 1838 when he was appointed Chief Engineer of the Army. Francis Malbone House, Newport, circa 1888 Dr. James R. Newton owned the house in 1850 and built a brick office on the estate for his doctor's office, now known as \\"The Counting House\\". The Francis Malbone house was restored in the early 1970s. The front door of the mansion features an Ionic doorway very similar to the Ionic portico of the Touro Synagogue. The floor plan features a broad central hall with flanking rooms on either side. The hall has a high divided arch, the stairs are fitted with ramped rail and twisted balusters. The stair landing is lit by a Palladian window. The front parlors feature plush paneling, a sign of wealth in colonial times. Two-story pediment mantels adorn the fireplace walls and a broken scroll tops the one in the northwest parlor. In 1989, the house reopened the estate \\"as an Historic Inn, offering nine guest rooms. In 1996, they embarked on building a sensitively designed addition, which has allowed the inn to expand to eighteen luxurious guestrooms.\\" See also *Southern Thames Historic District *National Register of Historic Places listings in Newport County, Rhode Island References Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Rhode Island Category:Houses in Newport, Rhode Island Category:National Register of Historic Places in Newport, Rhode Island Category:Historic district contributing properties in Rhode Island Category:Houses completed in 1758 Category:Georgian architecture in Rhode Island ","title":"Francis Malbone House"},{"id":"17341050","title":"Jay Papasan"},{"id":"17341054","text":"Bandy is a winter sport.

He conducted his PhD research at Racal-MESL Ltd near Edinburgh in Scotland as well as at the University of Leeds.Biographical details from the EPSRC website He was an applications engineer for Mullard Applications Laboratory from 1977-78. He lectured at the Department of Electronics in the University of York from 1982-83. From 1983-2005 he was a member of staff at the University of Leeds, his former alma mater, working in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, becoming professor of microwave engineering in 1992. He was head of the school from 1995‚Äì98 and for a while was a warden of Bodington Hall. Whilst at Leeds he was a founder of the Institute of Microwave and Photonics.

In 2009 he announced 65 job cuts, just weeks after the University announced it had successfully bid for ¬£600,000 funding to help people at risk of losing their jobs during the recession. He was later criticised for proposing further job cuts despite the university being in ¬£4m surplus at the time. Under his leadership, Surrey considered introducing metric measurement of staff performance based on the number of students achieving 60% or above and later considered a new threshold that staff needed to reach in student evaluations (3.8/5) if they were to avoid being targeted for special measures, the latter prompting UCU to consider a vote of no confidence in Snowden. The University achieved 4th place in the 2016 Guardian University League Table Guardian University Guide 2016 rising from 6th place in 2015. Surrey was named University of the Year in The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2016. It came top in the 'best teaching' and 'best student experience' categories. This was despite an ongoing dispute with students and the UCU over cuts across the University. =Universities UK= Snowden was president of the 134-member Universities UK group (UUK), from 1 August 2013 to 31 July 2015. He succeeded Eric Thomas, the vice-chancellor of the University of Bristol and was succeeded by Dame Julia Goodfellow. From November 2012 to August 2013 Snowden held one of the vice- president positions of UUK, representing England and Northern Ireland, and from 2009 to 2011 he chaired their Employability, Business and Industry Policy Committee. =University of Southampton= On 20 March 2015, the University of Southampton announced that Snowden would become its new Vice Chancellor following the retirement of Professor Don Nutbeam, a move which took effect from October 2015. In 2017, Snowden spearheaded the biggest investment programme in Southampton's 155-year history, with a plan to invest over ¬£600 million over the next decade. To do this, the University raised a ¬£300 million bond. In June 2017 Snowden spoke out against the Teaching Excellence Framework which had given Southampton University a Bronze rating, calling it \\"fundamentally flawed\\" and having \\"no value or credibility\\". In 2018 the University of Southampton was awarded Silver rating, Snowden released a statement thanking those within the institution who had contributed and stating the rating was an assurance to students that their experience at the University of Southampton will translate into excellent graduate outcomes. Snowden retired from his role at Southampton in Spring 2019. He will be succeeded as Vice-Chancellor by Professor Mark Smith. =Criticism of salary= From June 2017 Snowden's salary became part of the UK wide debate on Vice Chancellor's pay which had been started by criticism of the pay of Dame Glynnis Breakwell Vice Chancellor of the University of Bath. Snowden's salary of ¬£433,000 was among the higher salaries in the UK Higher Education sector and drew specific criticism from then Universities Minister Jo Johnson and Labour Peer Lord Adonis. In March 2018 The Guardian, in an article about UK Vice Chancellors pay, highlighted that Snowden's salary as the head of University of Southampton, was higher the chief executives of Southampton City Council(¬£166,786) or University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust(¬£195,000)https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/11/university- vice-chancellors-are-paid-far-more-than-public-sector-peers There was additional criticism of a substantial pay increase, including by UCU general Secretary Sally Hunt. However this was later clarified as being the difference between Snowden's payment for his first 10 months in his role in 2015-16 compared to his salary first full 12 months in employment in the academic year 2016-17. The Chair of the University of Southampton's Council Gill Rider defended Snowden's level of remuneration as reflecting his experience. Research Snowden's research interests are in the areas of microwave, millimetre-wave and optoelectronic devices and circuits. He pioneered the application of numerical physical device models to comprehensively describe electron transport in microwave transistor operation and in particular investigating device-circuit interaction properties. This allowed transistor designs to be significantly improved and optimized. This work was specifically recognised in his election as a Fellow of the Royal Society The Royal Society Archive and as a Fellow of the IEEE. His early work was focused on two- dimensional numerical modelling. In particular, he worked on hot-electron effects in short-gate length field effect transistors (FETs), where he showed that the high energy electrons in transistor substrates contributed significantly to the conduction current.Snowden, C.M. and Loret, D, \\"Two dimensional hot electron models for short gate length GaAs MESFET's\\", IEEE Trans. Electron Devices, pp.212 223, February 1987 He also contributed to the development of new non-linear laser diode models which found particular application in emerging high data rate communication systems.Iezekiel S., Snowden, C.M and Howes M.J., \\"Nonlinear Circuit Analysis of Harmonic and Intermodulation Distortions in Laser Diodes Under Microwave Direct Modulation\\", IEEE MTT, Vol. 38, No.12, pp.1906-1915, December 1990Lim, C.G., Iezekiel, S., and Snowden, C.M, \\"Nonlinear Dynamics of Optically-Injected Self-Pulsating Laser Diodes\\" IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, Vol.37, pp.699-706, May 2001 During the mid-1980s, along with colleagues in Lille and Duisburg universities, he explored the potential for a new class of physical model which became known as the quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) approach. CORE This was shown to be extremely effective at modelling field-effect transistors such as the popular metal semiconductor FET (MESFET). Snowden's models were shown to have the ability to accurately predict the DC and RF performance based on the physical geometry and material properties available from fabrication data.4 Snowden, C.M. and Pantoja, R.R., \\"GaAs MESFET Physical Models for Process Oriented Design\\", IEEE Trans. MTT, Vol. 40, No.7, pp.1401-1409, July 1992 Moreover, the Q2D model can be solved over 1000 times faster than full two-dimensional models, making it suitable for computer aided design applications.Snowden, C.M. and Pantoja, R.R., \\"Quasi Two Dimensional MESFET Models Application and Validation\\", European Transactions on Telecommunications and Related Technologies, No. N.4-1990, Volume 1, pp.383-388, August 1990Pantoja, R.R., Howes, M.J., Richardson, J.R.R and Snowden, C.M., \\"A Large Signal Physical MESFET Model for CAD and its Applications\\" IEEE Trans. MTT, pp.2039 2045, December 1989 These models were widely used around the world in industry and academia. The models were used to develop high performance microwave transistors with highly predictable characteristics which went on to be manufactured in high volumes by several companies. One of the most successful was the 'hi-lo-hi' pulse-doped microwave transistor which achieved high breakdown voltages and was particularly suited to high volume manufacturing.Snowden, C.M. and Pantoja, R.R., \\"GaAs MESFET Physical Models for Process Oriented Design\\", IEEE Trans. MTT, Vol. 40, No.7, pp.1401-1409, July 1992 Snowden went on to apply this technique to high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), between 1995 and 2005 utilizing highly effective quantum charge-control models.Drury, R. and Snowden, C.M., \\"A Quasi- Two-Dimensional HEMT Model for Microwave CAD Applications\\", IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, pp. 1026-1032, June 1995 It was shown to be an effective method for modelling and designing AlGaAs/GaAs HEMTs and the important pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistors (pHEMTs) based on InGaAs/GaAs systems. New designs of power pHEMT (some with capabilities of over 100 W at 2 GHz) were developed and fabricated using this knowledge, which achieved high breakdown voltages whilst retaining excellent signal gain at microwave frequencies.M. Akkul, M. Sarfraz, J. Mayock, and W. Bosch, \\"50 watt MMIC power amplifier design for 2 GHz applications,\\" in Proc. IEEE Int. Microwave Symp., Fort Worth, TX, June 2004, pp. 1355‚Äì1358 pHEMTs are widely used in communication applications and many billions of circuits based on pHEMT integrated circuits have been used in products such as mobile phones, radar and satellite receivers.O'Keefe, M.F., Atherton, J.S., B√∂sch, W., Burgess, P., Cameron, N.I., and Snowden, C.M., \\"GaAs pHEMT Based Technology for Microwave Applications in a Volume MMIC Production Environment on 150mm Wafers\\", IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing, Vol.16, No.3: 376‚Äì383, August 2003 More recently, since 2008 he has applied new Q2D models to laterally diffused MOS power transistors (LDMOS) for high power amplifiers in communications systems, achieving similar high levels of accurate prediction and speed advantage.Everett, J, Kearney, M.J., Rueda, H., Johnson, E.M., Aaen, P.H., Wood, J, and Snowden, C.M., \\"A Quasi-Two-Dimensional Model for High- Power RF LDMOS Transistors\\" (10.1109/TED.2011.2160546) IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, Vol. 58, No. 9, pp.3081-3088, September 2011Aaen P., Wood J., Bridges D., Zhang L., Johnson E., Lamey D., Barbieri T., Pla J., Snowden C.M., Everett, J.P. and Kearney, M.J., Multiphysics Modeling of RF & Microwave High-Power Transistors, IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques, Vol. 60, No. 12, pp. 4013- 4023, December 2012 4013 During the period 1990 to 1997 Snowden developed a new electrothermal physics-based equivalent circuit model for heterojunction bipolar transistors which was suited to power amplifier applications (widely used in cellular handsets). He was awarded the IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society Microwave Prize in 1999 for this work described in his 1997 paper \\"Large-signal Microwave Characterization of AlGaAs/GaAs HBT's Based on a Physics Based Electrothermal Model' (IEEE TMTT, MTT-45, pp. 58‚Äì71, 1997). Snowden went on to develop further models based on incorporating the interaction between thermal effects and electronic behaviour, which proved to be important in accurately modelling power transistor and in power amplifier designs. Subsequently, he developed this into fully integrated models incorporating electromagnetic effects into the physical models and demonstrating the significance of this type of global model for millimetre-wave circuits.Denis, D., Snowden, C.M., Hunter, I., \\"Coupled Electrothermal, Electromagnetic and Physical Modeling of Microwave Power FETs\\", IEEE Trans. Microwave Theory and Techniques, Vol. 54, No. 6, pp. 2465-2470, June 2006 He also developed several novel techniques for integrating microwave, millimeter-wave and optical circuits and during his time at M/A-COM whilst working as Senior Staff Scientist he extended their glass microwave integrated circuit (GMIC) technology to photonics, introducing the concept of embedding light guides in the GMIC to allow photonic circuits and interfaces to solid-state lasers, detectors and high speed processors. He first presented these concepts at the 1991 IEEE LEOS conferenceSnowden, C.M., \\"Modeling of III-V Electronic and Optoelectronic Devices: An Overview\\", Invited Speaker, IEEE/Lasers and Electro-Optics Society/Optical Society of America, Proceedings Integrated Photonics Research Conference, April 9th-11th 1991 and the concept was subsequently developed for use at 622Mbit/s in synchronous optical network (SONET) applications.Stavros Iezekiel, , Eric A.

The film tells the story of a group of young queer kids who have been discarded by straight society. They come together to form a de facto family under the wing of an African American vigilante drag queen named Destiny. FAQs premiered at the 2005 Philadelphia International Gay & Lesbian Film Festival and had a limited theatrical release in 2006. While mainstream critics praised a number of the performances and certain aspects of the film, generally critical response was negative. Plot After filming a porn video and being ripped off by the producer (Arthur Roberts), India (Joe Lia) meets a street hustler. Moments later they are attacked by a pair of gay bashers. They split up and run and the bashers pursue India in their Jeep. They stop short at the sight of India standing next to Destiny (Allan Louis) a vigilante African American drag queen pointing a gun at them. Destiny vandalizes the Jeep and takes the coat from one of the bashers. Destiny invites the homeless India to live with her. There he meets Lester (Minerva Vier), a young lesbian and another of Destiny's \\"orphans.\\" The next morning, upon learning that Destiny is a porn director India panics and plans to leave. He tells Destiny about being ripped off and she asks if he wants to kill the producer. He says yes, and that he wants to kill all straight people. India goes to the producer's home with a gun. He finds the producer and pulls the trigger, but the gun is not loaded. A few days later, as they discuss plans to foment the collapse of the straight world, Destiny, India and Lester meet Spencer (Lance Lee Davis), a graffiti artist and self-proclaimed \\"bomber,\\" They immediately \\"adopt\\" him. After spending the night together, Spencer and India discover the basher's address inside his coat and decide they want to go bash him. As Destiny and her friend Matinee (Tara Nova) socialize in Destiny's car, Officer Vic Damone (Vince Parenti) comes to warn them that the police are on the lookout for roving bands of vigilante drag queens and to watch out for themselves. Destiny (realizing that Vic is attracted to her) advises him that they're already always watching out for themselves. Spencer and India are approached on the street by a photographer. As the pair pose together nude on a bed, Spencer recites a litany of injuries he has received at the hands of his parents and other straights. India tries to comfort him but Spencer says he no longer has feelings and doesn't let anyone in. India vows to protect him from the straights. The next morning, on the way to the basher's house, India discovers a detonator in Spencer's backpack. Spencer tells him that he plans to blow up his parents. India tries to dissuade him but Spencer is not convinced that bombing straights isn't the way to go. India and Spencer spot the basher in his neighborhood and argue over whether they should bash him as Spencer wants or try to \\"save\\" him as India wants. India has adopted Destiny's theory, that all gay bashers are themselves repressed gays who need to be saved. India returns the basher's jacket. The basher, Guy (Adam Larson), admits that he's gay. He packs his things and tells the other basher, his roommate Quentin (Josh Paul) that he's gay, he loves him and believes Quentin loves him too. Quentin has a gun to his head, contemplating suicide, but is interrupted by his brother. Quentin angrily acknowledges that he is gay and drives away. Destiny tells Vic she's in love with him and Vic tells Destiny he's in love with her too. As Vic leaves for work, he passes India, Spencer and Guy with his gun pointed in their general direction. They confront Destiny about being involved with a cop, until Destiny realizes who Guy is and orders him out. India and Spencer threaten to leave with him, but Guy agrees to go. India appeals to Destiny and she relents. India and Spencer chase after him but can't find him. Meanwhile, Guy returnes to the apartment and apologizes for attacking them. Destiny accepts him and Lester nicknames him \\"Killer.\\" India wants to make plans for the evening with Spencer but Spencer already has plans, to blow up his parents. India begs him not to go, saying that he won't come back from it. Destiny interrupts another gay bashing. The basher strikes her with a baseball bat and Destiny shoots him. Later, Vic comforts her and Destiny tells him he has to be careful around her kids. They all have \\"police stories.\\" Quentin, in response to a message from Guy, arrives at Destiny's apartment, where he finds Guy in bed with India and Spencer. Quentin orders him to come away with him, giving him the choice of \\"straight or dead.\\" The boys argue that Quentin is in love with Guy and Quentin breaks down, admitting how much in love with Guy he is. Quentin again points the gun at his own head but Guy stops him and they kiss. India appeals again to Spencer not to blow up his parents. He says that if Spencer really wants to kill them, he will help, but if Spencer really wants to blow them away, he will stay with India. \\"All we have to do is kiss, because when two guys kiss it's like a bomb going off in the straight world. Our kisses are louder than bombs.\\" Spencer admits that he has fallen in love with India but is terrified because he's losing control. But he also feels safe, like he's home. India tells him that wherever they are, as long as they are together they're home. They kiss, and with each kiss they call out a target that their kiss has destroyed like a bomb, finally declaring that they will blow up the whole straight world.

The Los Angeles Times, while calling Louis' Destiny a \\"striking mix of Grace Jones and Catwoman,\\" found that the \\"campier aspects are not enough to make up for its lapses into melodrama and just plain silliness.\\" The Philadelphia City Paper largely concurred, finding the film hard to take seriously with its premise that every gay basher is really a closet homosexual and the concept of Destiny's character completely unbelievable. While finding a \\"reasonable tale\\" in Lewis' story and praising the performances, particularly those of Louis and Lia, nonetheless the conclusion is that the film is \\"awash in aimless, campless hyperbole and hysteria.\\" The LA Weekly offered kudos to Lewis for his \\"adept[ness] at modulating both tension and free-flowing interpersonal relationships\\" and praising cinematographer Kelly, but notes that the film \\"seems less comfortable in its own skin than his other work...the dialogue is blunter, and harder for his amateur cast to pull off, while Lewis‚Äô stridency, however justified, ultimately jars against the film's tender, all-is-love fantasia.\\" Notes External links  Category:2005 films Category:American films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:Films directed by Everett Lewis Category:American vigilante films Category:2000s vigilante films ","title":"FAQs (film)"},{"id":"17341153","text":"Artnet.com is an art market website.

The film is based on the life of Italian-born violinist Nadja Salerno- Sonnenberg, and it received a nomination for Best Feature Documentary Film at the 72nd Academy Awards. Content The film is based on the life and career of Italian-born classical violinist Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, and provides an insight into the style of the artist - who is noted by critics for pouring her own emotions into her musical performances. The film started from Salerno- Sonnenberg's birth in Rome, and followed her story as she moved to United States at age 8 and was brought up by her mother in New Jersey. She grew up with her brother who is also a musician. The film concentrates on the violinist's difficult childhood as she had to experience scorn and laughter by her friends when she played a recording of Brahms in front of the class. This is among the incidents that caused the artist to develop her overly emotional performing style and personality as she became a professional violinist and rose to stardom. In the documentary, Salerno-Sonnenberg talks about periods of depression in her life and her suicide attempt; she also discusses her views on how music is connected to human emotions. Production and release The documentary was directed by Paola di Florio, a childhood friend of Salerno- Sonnenberg.Intense Portrait of High-Strung Violinist from San Francisco Chronicle Salerno-Sonnenberg appeared as herself in the film.

However, he held no position after serving as curate until 1845 at Tremeirchion. He was influenced by the Oxford Movement and corresponded with John Henry Newman, before and after Newman converted to Catholicism.

His major works were An Introduction to the Study of Dogmatic Theology (1858), and Institutes of Canon Law (1884), written at the prompting of Walter Kerr Hamilton, who was Bishop of Salisbury.

It houses the Carnegie Institution for Science, a philanthropic scientific research organization founded in 1902 by Andrew Carnegie. In recognition of the building's architecture and its unique tenant, the building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965.Blanche Higgins Schroer and Steven H. Lewis (1964) , National Park Service and The building was also designated a contributing property to the Sixteenth Street Historic District in 1978. Description and history The Carnegie Institution for Science, formerly known as the Carnegie Institute of Washington, is located in Washington's Dupont Circle neighborhood, north of Scott Circle at the southeast corner of 16th and P Streets NW. It is a large and roughly rectangular structure, two stories in height, its exterior finished in Indiana limestone. Facing west toward 16th Street is its monumental front facade, with ten full-height Ionic columns (six in front and four in the center) supporting an entablature and flat balustraded roof. The original main building was basically square, with small flanking wings. To this a rear addition was made in 1937, using similar materials and design. The interior houses offices and meeting spaces, as well as a 450-seat auditorium. Andrew Carnegie established the Carnegie Institute of Washington in 1902 with an endowment of $10 million. The front portion of the building, designed by Carrere and Hastings, was built in 1910, and the rear addition, built in 1937, was designed by William Adams Delano. The building presently houses administrative functions of the Institute, which has its primary research functions elsewhere. The organization's mission is to fund talented individuals so that they can perform basic research for the betterment of mankind without significant constraints.

Neijing (Traditional Chinese:ÂÖßÂãÅ) or Neigong (Traditional Chinese: ÂÖßÂäü), in contrast, refer to \\"internal\\" forces produced via advanced mental control over psychic energy (the qi). The degree of Li force one can employ in kung fu depends on several variables such as resilience of muscles, strength of bones, speed and timing of attack and so on. An effective way to enhance the Li force is to exercise one's muscles and bones by applying increasing pressure on them (weight training, gym exercises, etc.).Èô≥Èùñ„ÄÇ„ÄäÊã≥ÈÅì‰∏≠Á≠âÂ≠∏ : Â§™Ê•µÊã≥ÈçäËàáÊÇü„Äã„ÄÇÈ¶ôÊ∏ØÔºöÈô≥ÈùñÔºåÁ¨¨‰∏âÁâàÔºö2004Âπ¥„ÄÇÈ†Å89„ÄÇ Chen Jing, Quan dao zhong deng xue: Tai ji quan lian yu wu (Insights in Practice on TaiJi), Hong Kong: Chen Jing, 2004, page 89 The stronger one's muscles and bones become, the more powerful and skillful the level of kung fu is.Èô≥Èùñ„ÄÇ„ÄäÊã≥ÈÅìË¶ÅÁï•„Äã„ÄÇÈ¶ôÊ∏ØÔºöÈô≥ÈùñÔºå‰øÆË®ÇÁâàÔºö2005Âπ¥12Êúà„ÄÇÈ†Å21Ëá≥24„ÄÇ Chen Jing,Quan dao yao lue (Principles of Quan Dao), Hong Kong: Chen Jing, 2004, pp. 21-24 On the other hand, the level of the Neijing force depends on the extent one can exercise over one's will power to release an inner qi energy. Within the framework of Chinese martial arts, every person is believed to possess the inborn energy of qi. Martial artists can harness the force of qi so that it is strong enough to be applied in combat. When qi is being directed by one's will, it is called Neijing.Èô≥Èùñ„ÄÇ„ÄäÊã≥ÈÅì‰∏≠Á≠âÂ≠∏ : Â§™Ê•µÊã≥ÈçäËàáÊÇü„Äã„ÄÇÈ¶ôÊ∏ØÔºöÈô≥ÈùñÔºåÁ¨¨‰∏âÁâàÔºö2004Âπ¥„ÄÇÈ†Å38Ëá≥41„ÄÇ Chen Jing, Quan dao zhong deng xue: Tai ji quan lian yu wu (Insights in Practice on TaiJi), Hong Kong: Chen Jing, 2004, pp 38-41 The Li force is observable when it is employed. Unlike the Li force, Neijing is said to be invisible. The \\"pivot point\\" essential to Li combat is not necessary in Neijing.

The center's mission is to \\"catalyze just and sustainable solutions to critical issues of peace and security by driving policy progress, advancing effective global governance, and advocating for collective action.\\" The organization was founded in 1956 by C. Maxwell and Elizabeth M. Stanley and is headquartered in Muscatine, IA.  Description  Originally established as a conduit for charitable giving, the center became more mission-focused and dedicated to research, education in international relations, and promotion of multilateral policy solutions through the United Nations. Following Max Stanley's death in 1984, Richard H. Stanley became chair of the center, a position he held until shortly before his death in 2017. From 2007 to January 2013, Vladimir P. Sambaiew served as the foundation's president, capping a distinguished 30-year career as a Foreign Service Officer in the US Department of State. After his retirement he was replaced on January 11, 2013 by Keith Porter, who had been with the Stanley Foundation for 24 years prior to his election. Brian Hanson, a great- nephew of Max and Elizabeth Stanley, now serves as chair. In addition to a diverse series of cross-sector policy dialogues, commissioned analyses, and programs for journalists, the Stanley Center has historically been recognized for its media. From 1974 to 2004, the center published the influential international news magazine World Press Review. Common Ground, an award- winning weekly radio program on world affairs, ran from 1980 to 2004. The center publishes the tri-annual magazine Courier.

It opened on April 24, 2007 and eventually closed June 1, 2011. International versions of the site closed on April 30, 2011. Mattel also released a line of MP3 players that looked like avatars from the website, these devices came with a free VIP membership for the site.  History  BarbieGirls.com opened on April 24, 2007. After one week of opening, 200,000 members had signed up. Mattel proclaimed the site to be \\"The fastest growing virtual world in history\\". The site was called \\"BarbieGirls BETA\\" for a while, until it eventually came out of beta. BarbieGirls was aimed primarily at young girls, so Mattel made it so that players were only allowed to play with a female avatar. The site had a huge community, with many active fansites dedicated to sharing info on the game. BarbieGirls.com eventually shut down on June 1, 2011. Players were given notice in advance, and VIP Memberships were refunded. The official reason Mattel gave for the closure of the site was \\"BarbieGirls.com is closing as the Barbie brand is exploring new opportunities where girls can experience the best of Barbie. We are committed to providing girls with the best play experience both on and offline.\\" The homepage encouraged users to join Stardoll, promising to give them free BarbieGirls inspired items for their avatar in the game. Three popular BarbieGirls games were uploaded to Barbie.com so they could be played after the closure. A folder containing images and wallpapers from BarbieGirls.com was also made available for download. Fans were upset with the closure. They created petitions to re-open the site, but none of them caught Mattel's attention. No plans have been made to re-open the site. The original URL for BarbieGirls redirects the user to Barbie.com.  MP3 Players  A line of customisable BarbieGirls MP3 players were released in 2007. They were designed to look like avatars from the game, with plastic clothes that could be interchanged. Extra fashion packs were available to get more outfits for the device. The player supported MP3 and WMA files that weren't protected by DRM. The device had 512MB of memory, with an SD Card slot to expand the storage space. A special 1GB version was also released. A disc was included with every device that allowed it to be registered with an account on BarbieGirls.com, to give the user a free VIP membership. A user with a BarbieGirls MP3 player was also allowed to become Best Friends with another user.  Gameplay  Each player had their own avatar whom they could purchase clothes and accessories for using B Bucks, the in-game currency. Players also each got their own room, which they could purchase \\"furni\\" for with their B Bucks. The game was free- to-play, but members could purchase a VIP membership, which gave them access to more locations, mini-games and items. Members could not purchase items unless they had a VIP membership. Secret codes also existed for players to type in to unlock rare items. Members were allowed to add friends and send pre-made messages to each other. A chat system called \\"B Chat\\" existed for avatars in the same room to communicate with each other. B Chat only allowed players to select from a list of phrases to send. To be able to type in whatever one wanted, an email must be sent to the parent or guardian for them to select whether they wanted their child to unlock \\"Super B Chat\\" or not. Two members who both owned BarbieGirls MP3 players were allowed to become \\"best friends\\" and participate in a \\"Secret B Chat\\" with each other. The mini-games on BarbieGirls.com were originally taken from other Mattel websites for My Scene and Pixel Chix, but eventually original games were featured. The in-game cinema paid players 20 B Bucks to watch a trailer for one of the many Direct- to-DVD Barbie films. After the closure of BarbieGirls.com, some URLs were found which still let one play a selection of the games from the site, but they no longer work. A few of the games from BarbieGirls were also put on the Barbie website, but they have been taken down, like the games from the site that were put on the Mattel website. In order to purchase a VIP membership, an account had to be part of the BarbieGirls Parent's Place, which allowed parents to control their child's account and give them online safety tips. When a player logged on, their avatar was sent to \\"B Central\\", which provided the user with buttons that teleported them to various areas in the virtual world. If the player clicked on the giant blimp in B Central, they would be sent to a page titled \\"Buzz & Goss\\", which contained all of the latest news about BarbieGirls.

The people are also experienced in handicrafts and collecting non-timber forest products and paper mulberry is also one of the main income generating activities. There are also numerous teak and rubber plantations in the district. Since irrigation for paddy rice cultivation was introduced in 2006 many people have turned to cultivating rice. Many of the villages have no electricity, no road access and no running water, and often no sanitation. Australian activists working for Plan have noted that because the district is so remote it is one of the poorest in Laos. Plan are working to improve sanitation, hygiene and water supply in the region. The provincial government has aimed to encourage more villagers in the isolated mountainous regions to move into the lowland to get better access to civil amenities such as roads, markets, schools, and healthcare centers.

Early life and education  Galit Hasan-Rokem was born in 1945 in Helsinki to Jewish parents who were also natives of Finland. She attended the Helsinki Jewish day school from 1952 to 1957. In 1957, at the age of 12, she immigrated with her family to Israel. Following high school graduation, she completed her compulsory military service and enrolled in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in the late 1960s. After attaining her undergraduate degree, she participated in an exchange program at the University of Finland's Department of Finnish and Comparative Folklore, where she studied under Professors Matti Kuusi and Lauri Honko, solidifying her desire to become a folklorist. She earned her doctorate at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1978, studying under Professor Dov Noy. She became a full professor of folklore at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1984. Work Hasan-Rokem's research interests include proverbs, folklore and culture of the Middle East, and folklore genres and narratives, including folklore in rabbinic literature. She has produced several major works studying proverbs in Israel and the proverbs of Georgian Jews in Israel. Hasan-Rokem displays a \\"conscious feminism\\" in her work. Her interdisciplinary approach to folklore, including the feminist aspects of her research, are frequently quoted by other authors. Books and other works by Hasan-Rokem have been published in more than eight languages.

In 2013 she translated the complete poems of Swedish poet Tomas Transtr√∂mer into Hebrew. Pro-Palestinian activist Hasan-Rokem is a founding editor of the Palestine‚ÄìIsrael Journal and a long- time pro-Palestinian activist. She is a strong supporter of the two-state solution and the division of Jerusalem into the capital of both Israel and a Palestinian state. As a visiting scholar at Rutgers University in 2014, she claimed that Israeli street signs exhibit bias against Arabic-speaking residents, since the Hebrew text is more prominent and the Arabic translation is often a phonetic version of the Hebrew.

Ystad Port 2017. The Suzuki Intruder is a series of cruiser motorcycles made by Suzuki from 1985 to 2005. After 2005, the Intruder lineup was replaced by the Boulevard range. In Europe, the Intruder name remains in use on certain models. The VS Intruder bikes all have 4-stroke V-twin engines. The Intruder line started life in North America with the Intruder 700 and the Intruder 1400, which was actually a 1360cc machine. The smaller version was designed to be small enough to escape the projected 45% US import tariff on imported bikes, while the larger version designed to take on the Harley 1340cc Evolution models as well as Japanese bikes like the Kawasaki Vulcan 1500. The US tariff, when passed into law, actually set the import limit at 750ccs instead of 700. So Suzuki soon bumped the Intruder up to be a 750, which it continued to produce until 1991. For the 1992 model year the small Intruder became an 800 (technically an 805), with a larger engine, larger radiator, and larger forks to go with the extra engine. The model would continue in this form until 2004, the only change of note being that Suzuki started painting the engine black in 1999. For the 2005 model year Suzuki decided to re-launch all their cruisers with the ‚ÄúBoulevard‚Äù name in an effort to sound less ‚ÄúJapanese crotch rocket‚Äù to American cruiser buyers. The slender, sporty VS Intruder 800 and VS1400 Intruder became the ‚ÄúBoulevard S50‚Äù and ‚ÄúBoulevard S83‚Äù respectively, their cubic centimeter names being replaced with the engine displacement in cubic inches. Other changes to the VS800 included straighter bars with longer risers; the addition of four-way flashers; a one-piece seat; smaller turn signals; the deletion of the sissy bar; and the addition of a plastic fake air cleaner on the side of the engine (to hold the tool kit formerly stored in the sissy bar). But mechanically they are the same, and parts can be swapped between the Intruder 800 to the S50. The exception is that fake air cleaner, which screws to threaded holes in blocks cast into the cooling fins on the cylinders, which the Intruder 800 did not have. As a side note, the VX800 standard/ naked sportbike was produced and sold in the US from 1991 to 1993. It used the same engine as the VS800 Intruder, only with a vacuum operated fuel pump instead of the Intruder‚Äôs electric one. The rest of the bike is totally different, but the engines interchange. Family The family consists of: *Liquid-cooled: ** VS400 ** VS600 with torque produced approx 46 Nm @ 6000 rpm. ** VS700 model for USA market between 1986 and 1987 ** VS750 The model with engine capacity was produced between 1985 and 1991. The engine is a four-stroke, water-cooled, OHC, 45-degree V-twin producing a maximum of 55 HP at 7,500 rpm with a compression ratio of 10:1, giving the bike a top speed of 165 km/h. Each cylinder has its own Mikuni carburetor. ** VS800 with torque produced approx 62,1 Nm @ 4000 rpm. This engine was also used on the Suzuki VX800 (56hp), Sachs Roadster 800 and Sachs B-805 (57hp) models albeit with different states of tune ** M1800R (M109R) ** C1800R (C109R) * Air/oil-cooled ** VL125 ** VL250 ** VS1400 with torque produced approx 115 Nm @ 3200 rpm. Total fuel capacity ‚âà 13L (3.3 gallons). Average fuel consumption is 38-46 mpg. ** VL1500 LC Transmission All Suzuki Intruders are powered by either a 4 or 5 speed transmission mated to a shaft drive which delivers power to the rear wheel. Starting in 1991, the VS1400 platform received the 5 speed transmission in most European countries. In the USA, this new 5 speed transmission debuted in the 1997 models, and in 1996, Canadian models were equipped with the same transmission. The Transmission is 5-speed, constant mesh. However the VL250 and European VL125 model Suzuki Intruder are both 5-speed chain-driven vehicles. Brakes The 805 cc and smaller models have front disc brakes and rear drum brake. The 1985 - 1987 models have the front brake rotor mounted on the left side, instead of right side found on later models. Their sissy bar is also shorter. The VS1400 and LC1500 Intruders used single disc brakes on both the front and rear wheels. Rim/Wheels Cast rims aka \\"Snowflake\\" rims were available as an option on the 1985 through 1987 VS700 (US Models) VS750 (Rest of the world) standard rims were Wire Spoke; 1989 VS800 got 21\\" front rim/wheel combo that lasted until 1999 model year. 2000 through 2009 VS800/S50 Boulevard run a 19\\" front 15\\" rear combination/. Both the 19\\" spoked/cast rims & the 21\\" spoke front rim from the VS700/750/800/S50 are a direct fit for the VS1400/S83, through ALL model years Special features In 1990 a MAP boost sensor was added to the VS1400 model to increase highway mileage. This correlated to a change in the ignitor unit, which went from a two socket 4/6 pin configuration, to a 4/9 pin configuration, with the left/right orientation of the two sockets reversed.

It is native to the southeastern United States, in Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama, growing in mature deciduous woodlands or on open rocky wooded slopes. Harbison first described the species in 1902. Unlike most other trilliums, its stems grow along the ground rather than standing upright, so that the plant appears to rest on the ground. Its leaves are mottled green and bronze, overlaid with silver, dying back early in the season. T. decumbens is a perennial herbaceous plant that blooms from mid-March to April. The flower petals are dark maroon or purple. After flowering, it bears a dark purple berry. Several central Georgia populations formerly identified as T. decumbens are thought to constitute a new species, T. delicatum. The latter differs markedly from T. decumbens genetically, morphologically, and ecologically, resembling it only in general appearance.

Education and career Elliott Dodds was born in Sydenham, in Kent, the son of a tea merchant. He was educated at Mill Hill School and New College, Oxford where he read history. While at Oxford Dodds was editor of Isis magazine and was narrowly defeated for the presidency of the Union. After graduating he worked briefly for Herbert Samuel as his private secretary and tutor to Samuel's sons. He then went to Jamaica and taught at Calabar High School. He returned to England intending to read for the bar but was drawn instead to journalism accepting the post of leader writer and literary assistant on the Huddersfield Examiner in 1914. He maintained his connection with the Huddersfield Examiner for sixty years, as editor from 1924 to 1959 and Consulting Editor after that.Egan, M., \\"Elliott Dodds\\", in D. Brack & E. Randall, eds., Dictionary of Liberal Thought (North Yorkshire: Methuen, 2007). During the First World War, Dodds lived in London editing the War Pictorial, a government publication designed to bolster civilian morale.George Smith, The Cornhill Magazine, Smith, Elder & Co, 1975, p.596. Politics and liberalism In 1920 Dodds wrote his first book, Is Liberalism Dead? As far as Dodds‚Äô efforts to enter Parliament were concerned, it seemed it was. He tried without success at York in 1922 and 1923, at Halifax in 1929 and at Rochdale in 1931 and 1935. At Rochdale in 1931, Dodds stood in support of the National Government but because of his views on free trade and opposition to tariffs the Conservatives decided to put up their own National candidate thus splitting the anti-Labour vote.The Times, 19.19.31 Un-discouraged by his defeats, he continued to play a role in the National League of Young Liberals of which he was president from 1932 to 1937The Times, 17.3.33, 21.3.35 & 29.3.37 and to write about Liberalism publishing Liberalism in Action in 1922 and The Social Gospel of Liberalism in 1926.Mark Egan: Elliott Dodds in Dictionary of Liberal Biography, Brack et al. (eds.), Politico‚Äôs 1998, p.97 Dodds‚Äô Liberalism was in the classical liberal tradition, unsympathetic to excessive state intervention in the economy and it put him in broad opposition to the social and industrial policies which the party took up in the 1920s and 1930s in response to the depression and mass unemployment. However he was clever and tribal enough to recognise the electoral value of such policies and politically nimble enough to reconcile it with his own position by placing it in the several strands of liberal thought around which the party needed to coalesce. As Wilson points out, there was a choice for radicals and traditionalists in the party. They could withdraw from politics, they could defect to other parties or they could \\"allow distrust of Lloyd George to be outweighed by sympathy for the new thought and daring programme he was offering\\".Trevor Wilson, The Downfall of the Liberal Party 1914‚Äì1935; Cornell University Press, 1966, p.340 In 1938 Dodds chaired the party's ‚ÄòOwnership for All‚Äô Committee. Its resulting report reiterated the traditional Liberal position on the role of property ownership as the ‚Äòbedrock of liberty‚Äô. The report called for restoration of free trade, reforms of the rating system, and came out against state intervention in the economy except in the most extreme of circumstances. More positively it also promoted co-ownership in industry ‚Äì a policy with which Dodds became increasingly associated.Peter Barberis, Liberal Lion, Jo Grimond: A Political Life; I B Tauris, 2005, p.54 The report was endorsed by the 1938 Liberal Assembly but was a cause of tension and dispute between the left and right of the party for years.Robert Ingham: Elliott Dodds in Dictionary of Liberal Thought Brack & Randall (eds.) Politico‚Äôs, 2007 p 93ff However Dodds was not one of those Liberals like Arthur Seldon, Oliver Smedley, Alfred Suenson- Taylor, 1st Baron Grantchester or S. W. Alexander who openly campaigned to build high the edifice of Gladstonian liberalism in the party to ward off the rising floodwater of William Beveridge and John Maynard Keynes and who drifted away from mainstream party thinking to the right, into influential think-tanks like the Institute of Economic Affairs or organisations such as the Society for Individual Freedom between the 1930s and 1960s. Dodds welcomed the Beveridge Report and maintained links with the radical wing of the party. In 1953 he became chairman of the Unservile State Group, which aimed to explore the attitudes and policies of British Liberalism for the first time since the publication of the Liberal Yellow Book in 1928. It did not seek to promote any particular Liberal brand or establish any new path for the Liberalism but disseminate ideas which were distinctly liberal, reflecting the rich variety of the liberal tradition.Peter Barberis, The Unservile State Group in Brack & Randall (eds.) The Dictionary of Liberal Thought Politico's, 2007 In 1957 Dodds wrote in the opening chapter of the book The Unservile State: Essays in Liberty and Welfare that he looked forward to the Liberals ‚Äòre-establish[ing] themselves in their natural position as the acknowledged leaders of the Left...‚Äô.Watson, G. G., ed., The Unservile State: Essays in Liberty and Welfare (Crows Nest: Allen & Unwin, 1957), p. 26. He understood that political parties could not stand still writing in his 1947 book The Defence of Man that ‚ÄòOn the Continent Liberal thought remained hobbled by the dogmas of laissez- faire, and the Liberal parties failed to go forward‚Äô.The Political Insight of Elliott Dodds by Donald Wade and Desmond Banks, Elliott Dodds Trust, 1977, p.15 Dodds was president of the Liberal Party in 1948The Times, 2.4.48 and was later elected on a number of occasions as one of the party's vice-presidents along with such figures as William Beveridge, Lady Megan Lloyd George, Dingle FootThe Times, 16.5.46 and Lady Violet Bonham Carter.The Times, 29.5.52 Family and private life Dodds married Frances Zita MacDonald, the daughter of a Congregationalist minister of religion, in 1918. They had two daughters. His wife died in 1971.The Times, 22.2.77 Dodds was a committed Christian serving Highfield Congregationalist Church as a deacon throughout his life and he loved to play golf.Wade and Banks op cit, p.8 References Works by Elliott Dodds *Is Liberalism Dead? ‚Äì 1920 *Liberalism in Action ‚Äì 1922 *Ownership for All ‚Äì 1938 *Let's Try Liberalism ‚Äì 1944 *The Defence of Man ‚Äì 1947 *\\"Liberty and Welfare\\", in Watson, G., ed., The Unservile State ‚Äì 1957 *The Logic of Liberty (with E.

Early life Born to a Greek father and a South African-born Ukrainian Jewish mother (Renee Hirschon), Philippakis lived in Greece until he was 4 years old when his family moved to South Africa. After living there for a year, his parents divorced. Every summer Philippakis would visit his father in Olympos on the Greek island Karpathos. His father played a significant role in his life regarding music, teaching him traditional Greek songs. Philippakis was raised in the Greek Orthodox religion. Education Philippakis was educated at Magdalen College School. There he had met all of the requirements for an assisted place at Magdalen, where he had taken classes on French, literature, and art. While attending school, Philippakis faced many difficulties due to his father's absence; he would get into trouble with the teachers and was ill-tempered. This led to his being suspended twice. Philippakis then went on to study English literature at St John's College, Oxford; he dropped out before completing his degree to focus on the band. Career =Music= Foals Philippakis formed FOALS in 2005 with friend and former Youthmovies frontman Andrew Mears after the break-up of his former band The Edmund Fitzgerald, which also featured his Foals bandmate, drummer Jack Bevan.

Special guests are kept secret until the night of the performance, making each night different. Every night at MILK is recorded and made available in limited numbers on vinyl for purchase at the following month's event. Philippakis said, \\"I want to make a club night that me & my friends would want to go to.

Under the Toki clan, a donjon was built, but it was destroyed when the clan was transferred elsewhere in 1692.

Review In May 2013, the hit musical, The Bodyguard, was staged at London‚Äôs Adelphi Theatre, the theme adapted from Bodyguard, a 1992 film starring Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner. It was a stage musical with a cast of Heather Headley as the superstar singer Rachel Marron and Lloyd Owen as Frank Farmer, an ex-Secret Service agent turned bodyguard. The formidable task fell into the hands of the set and costume designer, Tim Hatley, along with the Director Thea Sharrock, lighting designer Mark Henderson and video designer Duncan McLean and rest of the team. Hatley turned the stage show brilliantly to glide like the real movie. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs always a tricky thing having a film going onto the stage,‚Äù was what Hatley had to say about his work. The whole idea of turning a film into a musical was a big challenge for the reason that he had to keep the audience, already happy with the film, content too, maintaining the film story on one hand and avoiding bringing to stage a carbon copy. Hatley has proved himself to be a master in story telling, the theatrical way.

It consists of representatives of the ordained clergy of the Church of England.  Composition  The House of Clergy comprises ordained members of the Church of England below the rank of bishop. Members are elected by their fellow clergy to represent their individual Dioceses at their regional Diocesan Synod. Members are obliged to retire when they reach 70. The House of Clergy, like the House of Bishops and House of Laity, hold veto power over all proposed Church of England Measures and reports. An example of this was when the House of Clergy vetoed a report on homosexuals and same-sex unions. It comprises the Lower Houses of the Convocations of Canterbury and York.House of Clergy, The Church of England  Election  Elections to the House of Clergy take place every five years with by-elections held to fill any vacancies that may arise between elections. In practice the members of the House of Clergy are identical to the members elected to the Convocations of Canterbury and York. In order to be elected to the House of Clergy, the person must be an ordained member of the Church of England. A clergyman or women must be elected by the Deanery Synod of the area which includes the parish that they are licensed to work in, to the Diocesan Synod. From there, they must be elected by the members of the Diocesan Synod to the House of Clergy. In 1987, following the decision to allow ordination of women as Deacons in the Church of England, women became eligible for election to the House of Clergy for the first time. Members can also be co-opted and with a limited number being appointed. Membership consists of three elected representatives by each Diocese in the Province of Canterbury and the Province of York including the extraprovincial Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe and the Diocese of Sodor and Man (which only elects one member). Other members elected include one for the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and London, one jointly for the Universities of Durham and Newcastle, four elected by the other Universities split between Canterbury and York and six Deans elected from Cathedrals, plus either the Dean of Jersey or the Dean of Guernsey. The appointed ex officio members are the three senior Chaplains of the British Armed Forces, the Chaplain-General of Prisons and two members selected by the Anglican religious orders.

They are responsible for representing the laity of the Church of England in the legislature. They are indirectly elected every 5 years by members on the Church of England's electoral roll via the representatives on the Diocesan Synods.  History  The concept of giving the laity a voice in the governance of the Church of England dated back to the English Reformation when King Henry VIII of England broke the Church of England away from the Roman Catholic Church. The doctrine of lay supremacy was one of the rationales for the breakaway. Initially the Members of Parliament in the House of Commons were used as the lay representatives as all Church of England legislature had to go through Parliament. However during the 20th century, Parliament focussed little time on Church of England matters.Garbett, Cyril. The Claims of the Church of EnglandHodder & Stoughton:1947, p. 192 When the Church Assembly (predecessor to the General Synod) was established, it was decided that normal churchgoers would replace the House of Commons as the representatives of the laity; thus creating the House of Laity. The House of Laity, along with the House of Bishops and House of Clergy, hold a veto over Church of England Measures and reports. An example of this was in 2012 when the House of Laity failed to reach the two-thirds majority needed to approve the ordination of women bishops despite the other Houses of the Synod approving it.  Election  Members of the House of Laity are elected every five years. Despite their name, they are not directly elected by the Church of England's members. To be eligible for election a person has to be on the electoral roll of a Church of England parish church and be elected by their church's members or co-opted onto the parochial church council, then selected to represent the parish at the deanery synod. From there, they have to be selected to represent the Deanery at the diocesan synod, from whose numbers the diocese's representative to the General Synod is elected. There has been criticism of this method of election with suggestions that it leaves the system open to influence from special interest groups. There is no maximum age limit to sit in the House of Laity however some members have voluntarily chosen not to stand for re- election when they reach 70 on the grounds that Church of England clergy are obliged to retire at that age. All dioceses of the Province of Canterbury and the Province of York are represented with two representatives in the House of Laity. The Diocese of Sodor and Man is not represented in the House of Laity. However, the duties of the House of Laity insofar as measures extend to the Isle of Man are taken on by Tynwald.

He has eight books published by, or written about him. He is also known for being close friends with fellow magician Dai Vernon. Biography =Early life= Jennings was born in Detroit, Michigan, on February 17, 1933. He was born to John Alfred Jennings and Eva Jennings (n√©e Jones). After his parents divorced, Jennings divided his time between staying with his father in Detroit and his mother in Georgia. At age 16, while in Detroit, Jennings joined the United States Navy. He started his service on June 29, 1949, and was honorably discharged on April 22, 1953. After his discharge, Jennings moved back to Detroit and met a French-Canadian woman named Nina Chauvin, whom he later married. In 1956, while in Windsor, Ron Wilson moved in across the hall from Jennings. Jennings came over one day and asked Ron if he had a deck of cards. He then proceeded to show Ron the trick he had learned in the Navy. Afterwards, not knowing Ron was a magician, Jennings asked him if he knew any magic. Ron then showed Larry ‚ÄúOut of This World,‚Äù which completely fooled him. Jennings asked Ron to teach him the effect, but Ron resisted. Instead, he told him to think about it. Jennings eventually figured it out, and Ron continued to teach him magic, introducing him to the world of magic, including the magic of Edward Marlo and Dai Vernon. In the early 1960s, Jennings and Ron Wilson met Dai Vernon for the first time at a convention in Cleveland. =Magic career= In 1964, Karrell Fox told Jennings about the Magic Castle. Knowing that Dai Vernon now lived in Hollywood, Jennings quit his job as a combustion engineer. He and Nina moved to California and lived at 2005 Ivar Street, Apt. 7. In Hollywood, Larry got a job working for Leo Behnke‚Äôs father in the plumbing repair business. Jennings quickly became friends with Dai Vernon and studied under him. During this same year, Larry‚Äôs first published ideas, ‚ÄúA Snappy Lift‚Äù and ‚ÄúLift No. 2,‚Äù appeared in a letter from Dai Vernon to The Gen magazine. In July 1967, Jennings published his first set of lecture notes, Lecture Notes On Card And Coin Handling. These notes were written by his wife, Nina. In the same year, a collection of Jennings‚Äôs magic appeared in Dai Vernon‚Äôs Ultimate Secrets Of Card Magic. In 1969, Jennings traveled with Dai Vernon on his lecture tour of Japan. Here he met Hideo Kato, who acted as their interpreter. In 1970, a second set of notes were published for a special lecture Jennings gave at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, written by his. Larry‚Äôs one-man issue of Genii was also published in May 1970. The effects were written by Jules Lenier. In this same year, Hideo Kato came to America and studied card magic with Larry. He wrote a book on Larry‚Äôs card technique, entitled Larry Jennings-No Card Magic Nyuumon. Written in Japanese, the book has yet to be translated into English. Jennings and Nina were divorced early 1970s. In the mid-1970s, Jennings met his second wife, Geri, in Los Angeles. They married and moved to Lake Tahoe, where Jennings opened up his own plumbing company, Jenco. They later divorced. Also in the mid-1970s, Karl Fulves published a special two-part issue of Epilogue featuring Jennings‚Äô magic. Jennings met B.J. in Lake Tahoe in 1977, where she worked as a blackjack dealer at a casino Jennings frequents. Jennings also met Jeff Busby, who would release the book Jennings On Card And Coin Handling (1977). In 1979, Jennings was the guest of honor at the annual Fechter‚Äôs Finger Flicking Frolic. He presents a new lecture for the event. Following his appearance at Fechter‚Äôs, Larry was invited to lecture in Japan. The Japan Lecture Notes were produced for the occasion. These are put together by B.J. and Louis Falanga. In the early 1980s Jennings sold his business in Lake Tahoe and moved to Newport Beach, CA to work at the Magic Island. Jennings was the resident magician, and was placed in charge of booking. He tried to get higher pay for the magicians, and when the management refused, he quit. Jennings then moved in with James Patton. The two frequently had sessions. Jim convinced Jennings to do another lecture and in 1982, Jennings lectured at the Magic Castle, presenting the material from A Visit With Larry Jennings. Jennings later went to work for the Los Angeles Unified School District and moved to North Hollywood. Also in the early 1980s, Jennings went to France, and shot his first magic videos for Pierre Mayer. In 1986, Jennings and Louis Falanga started L&L; Publishing. In April 1986, Larry Jennings and Dai Vernon were invited to perform at the Circulo De Magios Maxicanos IV Convencion De Magia in Mexico. Also in 1986, The Classic Magic Of Larry Jennings was released. It would be the largest collection of Larry‚Äôs magic to date, containing over eighty effects. This was quickly followed by the publication of Neoclassics (1987) and The Cardwright (1988). Jennings and B.J. were wed on December 28, 1990. Michael Skinner would be the best man. During the 1990s, Larry continued to share his magic with two new sets of lecture notes and five videotapes. In 1995, Larry was awarded the Creative Fellowship by the Academy of Magical Arts. Larry continued to frequent the Magic Castle through this time, performing both formally and informally. Personal Jennings and B.J. continued to live in North Hollywood until his death on October 17, 1997, at age sixty-four. After death Since his death, Jennings‚Äôs magic continues to inspire with the publication of his effects in various magazines and most notably in Richard Kaufman‚Äôs book, Jennings ‚Äô67. It is the largest collection of Larry‚Äôs magic since The Classic Magic Of Larry Jennings. Two legendary names are associated with making the chop cup popular as they were their \\"signature\\" pieces ‚Äî Don Alan and Jennings. History records that Wheatley saw Jennings perform his chop cup routine at The Magic Castle shortly after it opened in 1963. He was so impressed that he asked Jennings to please not reveal his method or routine in print until after his death.

Early history The band came to prominence after taking top honors at the 1979 California World Music Festival held at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. More than 2100 bands entered the competition and shared the stage with Cheap Trick, Aerosmith, and Van Halen. In conjunction with their festival success, the Loosely Tight song \\"Rough and Tough\\" was the lead off track for radio station KDKB (93.3 FM)'s 1979 album, Arizona Sounds Volume 3. After a brief stint with Capitol Records, the band's album Fightin' Society (1981) found release on Star Struck Records (Catalog number TDS 020559). In 2000, The Arizona Republic named Loosely Tight as #28 in their list of The 100 Best Valley Rock Bands. Band members The Loosely Tight lineup included Dino Livingston (singer/songwriter/vocalist/guitarist), Mark Lehman (bass), Jr. Lomeli (guitar), and Pat Dixon (drums). The band's manager was Danny Zelisko. Later band members included Bob Hagen (drums), Danny Livingston (bass), and Donnie Mills (bass). Dixon went on to play drums with another Arizona based band, Icon, who recorded albums on both Capitol Records and Atlantic Records, while Lehman moved on to the band Surgical Steel, most notable for recording a song with Rob Halford of Judas Priest. Later history The songs on Fightin' Society are now controlled by independent record label Fervor Records. The label placed the band's music in various movies, including Paramount Pictures, The Love Guru (2008), Oscilloscope Laboratories, The Messenger (2009), Grindstone Entertainment Group, The Frozen Ground (2013), Bold Films, Stronger (2017), and Universal Pictures, American Made (2017). Loosely Tight's music has also been played on several TV series, including Get Shorty, Red Oaks, The Carrie Diaries, The Neighbors, Blood Drive, and Narcos. In 2011, Loosely Tight moved to Houston, Texas where Dino Livingston teamed up with bass player Wolff DeLong (former bass player for, most notably, Mean Gene Kelton and Super Chikan and the Fighting Cocks), and drummer, Rick Gomez. Delong and Gomez provided the rhythm section. Livingston continued to write songs and play guitar. On December 20, 2011, the band leader and lead singer, Dino (Dennis Wayne) Livingston, died of complications from diabetes. In 2012, Phoenix New Times chose Loosely Tight's song \\"Bombs Away\\" as one of the songs from 1981 which defined Arizona.

It was created by Niles, based on an original story by Cerrone. Niles wrote the book for the musical. The show's message is the power of love and dreams. Billed as a \\"New Broadway Musical Experience,\\" the show combined giant screen images in high definition with live actors, music and laser lighting effects. The hi- tech, quick editing equipment incorporated into the theater allowed the audience members to be videotaped upon their entrance and become part of the show's finale. Dreamtime ran on Broadway at the Ed Sullivan Theater in 1992. Production Origins Dreamtime is an adaptation of several of Cerrone‚Äôs earlier works. Cerrone was invited to perform several outdoor concerts with laser lights, synchronized water fountains and fireworks commemorating national celebrations before audience of hundreds of thousands. The first, in 1978 was a show inside a plexiglass pyramid on the Pavilion for 1200 people. Over the next ten years the concerts developed more of a theme and narrative storyline. In 1988 at the request of Paris‚Äô Minister of Culture, Jack Lang, Cerrone conceived the mystical rock opera, The Collector. The Collector, featured musicians Mary Hopkins, Steve Overland and rock bands YES, Earth, Wind & Fire, The Art of Noise and The Paris Opera Choir and was performed on the Trocadero in Paris. The show was revised for the 1989 celebration of the Bicentenary of the French Revolution on the edges of the Seine for an audience of over 600,000. This show called Evolution featured musicians Laura Branigan and Steve Overland with a cast of 30 in the ensemble and choir. In 1991, another version of the show, now called Harmony, was performed before an 800,000 member audience over the port of Tokyo. Harmony was produced to celebrate the launch of a new Japanese television satellite channel in high definition. Broadway director, David Niles and Cerrone had to rework these huge, spectacular outdoor concerts into a show that would fit into a 1200-seat theater ‚Äì the result was the Broadway musical experience Dreamtime. Production history During Dreamtime‚Äôs successful Broadway run at The Ed Sullivan Theater, Consolidated Properties, Inc sold the theater and the office space above to CBS to serve as the new home for the Late Show with David Letterman. CBS needed the theater immediately and struck a deal to move Dreamtime out of the theater. The show was given four weeks to vacate the theater and relocate. Due to the cost of moving the Broadway show and the lack of another comparable Broadway theater, the show closed permanently. The sale of the building and quick vacancy earned Brian Ezraty, the prestigious Henry Hart Rice Achievement Award for the Most Ingenious Deal of the Year for 1993. The show ran for 140 performances. Plot synopsis Dreamtime is the story of a woman, a man and the power of love and dreams. A narrator introduces the characters in the story. The narrator is a voice and a vision which appears throughout the story in many forms. The character of ‚ÄúThe Woman‚Äù represents all women. The character of ‚ÄúThe Man‚Äù represents all men. ‚ÄúThe Collector‚Äù is an omnipotent character who speaks through ‚ÄúThe Witness‚Äù and gives the gift of ‚ÄúThe Friend‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe Collector‚Äù urges the audience to take a journey. He explains that many people live a lifetime and never realize their dreams. He asks that the audience travel into ‚ÄúDreamtime‚Äù and help ‚Äúthe Women‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Man‚Äù to find their dream in one evening. ‚ÄúThe Collector‚Äù warns the chorus and the audience to beware of ‚ÄúThe Chief‚Äù who only sees life in black and white and wants people to only to dream while they sleep but not to pursue dreams in their daily life. In the beginning of the show, the loneliness of ‚ÄúThe Woman‚Äù and the longing of ‚ÄúThe Man‚Äù are heard through their music. ‚ÄúThe Man‚Äù is tempted by a fan and dreams of love. He is given the gift of friendship and with the help of the audience sees the love of ‚Äúthe Women‚Äù The audience is videotaped upon entering the theater and are incorporated into the projections during the finale hence, the cast and the audience become One.

It is the easternmost of the Sperrin Mountains. It reaches a height of and dominates the western shore of Lough Neagh. Its prominent northeastern summit has a transmitter station with a small road leading to it, and stands at a height of . By road, Slieve Gallion is from Moneymore, from Cookstown, and from Magherafelt. The mountain is part of the parishes of Desertmartin, Lissan and Ballinascreen. Nature Slieve Gallion is a volcanic plug. The mountain is formed from volcanic-derived igneous rock, and also granite on the southern slopes. It is steep, and has a flat top. There is a telecommunications mast on the northeastern summit. To the west, the landscape consists of blanket bog and coniferous forest; most of the trees in the Slieve Gallion area are Sitka spruce. There are also lodgepole pine trees, as well as oak towards the south of the area. Animal species living in the area include the Irish hare (a sub-species of the mountain hare), the curlew, and the red grouse. The otter can also be found around nearby rivers. Slieve Gallion is classed by the Northern Ireland Planning Service as an area of \\"High Scenic Value\\". History Peat formed at Slieve Gallion in the early Holocene period, around 10,000 years ago. The radiocarbon dating of pollen has shown that there were plants in the area 10,000 years ago. 7,000 ago, the number of alder trees steeply increased. From the Middle Ages until the 20th century, gatherings were held on the mountain to mark the festival of Lughnasadh. In recent decades, there has been an increase in the number of sheep grazing in the area, as well as an increase in mountain biking and hill walking, contributing to erosion. Sport There was formerly a challenge walk/run from the village of Moneymore to the summit of Slieve Gallon, which took participants through idyllic countryside such as Cairndaisy glen and the Postmans Way. There is now a yearly mountain race from the foot of Inniscarn Forest to the mountaintop and back, which normally takes place on the last Saturday of September or the first Saturday of October. Organised under the Northern Ireland Mountain Running Association, this event attracts some of Northern Ireland's top athletes and hosted the British & Ireland Junior Mountain Running Championships in October 2006. The sports of Hang Gliding and Paragliding use Slieve Gallion. This site is considered a good starting point to go cross country as there is little in the way of airspace restrictions in a down wind direction from its predominate flyable faces. Trivia In 2019 a wind farm was constructed on its eastern side known as Crockandun wind farm. Australian Gold firm Walkabout resources could collaborate with Koza UK to start a gold mine on the mountain. As of August 2020 the plans have not been approved or rejected by the government and are opposed by the population in the vicinity.

The runestone is one of several runestones that have permitted scholars to trace family relations among some powerful Viking clans in Sweden during the 11th century. Description The inscription consists of runic text on two intertwined serpents that form an oval around a Christian cross. p. 202. The runestone is an example of the Ringerike style, and it is categorized as being carved in runestone style Pr1. The runestone was raised by two women named Gyri√∞ and Gu√∞laug in memory of the master of the homestead whose name was Andsvarr and in memory of their father whose name was engraved as unif. These runes are interpreted as √ìn√¶m, the accusative case of √ìn√¶mr, a name which means \\"Slow Learner.\\" A man having this rare name, √ìn√¶mr, is also mentioned on two nearby runestones, U 112 in Kyrkstigen and U 336 in Orkesta, and so the three runestones are held to refer to the same person. The other runestones tell of the family of the two women, their father and the runemaster who made it. The runemaster Ulf of Borresta declared on U 336 that he was √ìn√¶mr's paternal nephew, and consequently he was Gyri√∞ and Gu√∞laug's first cousin. Ulf is notable in himself since the runestone U 344 in Ytterg√§rde declares that Ulf had taken three danegelds in England. The first one was with Skagul Toste in 991, the second one with Thorkel the High in 1012 and the last one with Canute the Great in 1018.Pritsak, Omeljan. (1981). The Origin of Rus.

The runestone U 112 in Kyrkstigen informs that a maternal nephew of √ìn√¶mr was Ragnvaldr who was the commander of the Varangian Guard in Constantinople. Ragnvaldr had the runestone U 112 made in memory of himself and his mother, √ìn√¶mr's daughter. √ìn√¶mr's daughter Gu√∞laug appears to have had the son Holmi who fell in Italy which is mentioned on the runestone U 133 in T√§by. It is likely that Holmi fell in battle as a member of the Varangian Guard in southern Italy. Andsvarr (an allomorph of √ñzurr and Assur), in memory of whom the runestone also was raised, may be the same man as the housecarl who is mentioned on the runestone U 330 in Snottsta.Pritsak, Omeljan.

The runic text ends with the imperitive Ra√∞ √æessi! which is translated as \\"Interpret these!\\" Other runestones with similar imperitive exclamations in their runic texts include U 29 in Hillersj√∂ and S√∂ 158 in √ñsterberga. p. 197. The runes for this phrase, ra√æisi, are carved on the serpent's tail and follow the rule that double consonants are represented with only a single consonant, even if one of the two consonants are at the end of one word and the second is at the beginning of the next word. The transliteration of the runic text for this phrase, ra√æ √æisi, shows a separate √æ-rune for each of the two words.

Fiske, of a colonial family in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, spent some years as a merchandiser in Melbourne, Australia, before returning to the United States in 1857.

Fiske's lavishly illustrated catalogues, issued at brief intervals, kept the firm in the public eye and incidentally show art historians how casually design patents were infringed in the nineteenth century. Fiske's designs ranged from the naturalistic foliate designs that were the stock-in-trade of mid-Victorian style to sculptures after the Antique or neoclassical works of Antonio Canova or Bertel Thorvaldsen, suitable for park-like landscapes of estates and landscape cemeteries of formal schemes. Fiske was also noted for his hammered copper weather vanes, produced in Williamsburgh, Brooklyn. Fiske's great rival in the decorative cast iron field was Jordan L. Mott's J. L. Mott Iron Works of New York City.Israel 2000. Since the later twentieth-century, unmarked pieces of decorative cast-iron of appropriate date are commonly attributed to J. W.

When I announced my arrival. a voice came from inside saying, \\"It is good that you came today Anbba Bemwah, God's saint, the one who was worthy to shroud the holy body of St. Hillaria the daughter of the great King Zenon\\". I entered the cave and was staring at this person for a long while, as he was venerable and full of awe. His face was a very lighted; he had a long beard with only a few black strands and was wearing a poor dress. He was thin, with soft voice and had a walking staff. He said, \\"You came to me today and brought death with you, and I have been waiting for you for a long time my beloved one\\". When I asked him about his name and how long he had been in this wilderness?, he said, \\"my name is Karas, I haven't seen no one for 57 years, and I have been waiting for you anxiously and happily\\". At the end of my first day Anbba Karas, became sick with a high fever and On the following day while he was lying down unable to move. A great light, brighter than the sunlight, was shining upon the cave entrance. A lighted figure wearing white cloth as bright as the sun entered holding a shiny cross on his right hand. I was sitting by 'Anbba Karas' feet and was very scared. This person stepped forward toward Anbba Karas and touched his face with the cross. He spoke with Anbba Karas for a while, then blessed him and left. When I inquired about this glorified person?, he said, this is our Lord and master Jesus Christ, He comes to me everyday, talks to me, blesses me, and then He leaves. I then asked him if I can get blessed from my lord Jesus Christ as well..?. He said, \\"Before you leave this place, you will see the Lord Jesus in His glory and He will bless you and talk to you as well\\". On the 8th day of Epip, Anbba Karas health was deteriorating by the mid-day, a great light appeared and filled the cave. The Savior of the universe entered, preceded by the Archangels Michael and Gabriel, and many other angels with six wings seraphim accompanied by prayers, hymns and great smell of incense from everywhere. I was sitting by Anbba Karas feet while our Lord Jesus Christ in all His glory was at Anbba Karas's head, who held our Savior's right hand. Anbba Karas, asked Jesus Christ if He can bless me because he came from very far, for this day?. The Lord looked at me and said, \\"May My peace be with you Bemwah, what you saw and heard today, will be written in the books and preached by you. But for you, My beloved Karas, every human that knows your vita and mentions your name on earth, will have My peace on them and I will count them with the martyrs and the saints. Everyone that offer wine, bread, incense, oil or candles in your name, I will reward them twofold in the Kingdom of Heaven. Anyone who feeds the hungry or gives drink to the thirsty, or clothes to the needy or welcomes a stranger on your name, I will reward them double in My kingdom. And who writes your vita I will write their name in the Book of Life. Anyone who shows mercy on your anniversary, I will give them what no eye had ever seen and, what no ear had ever heard and what any heart ever felt. Now, my beloved Karas, I want you to ask Me for something that I can do for you before your departure. Upon his request, David the Prophet came holding his harp in his hand and he was singing the psalm \\"This is the day the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.\\" Psalm 117:24. Anbba Karas then asked if he can do the ten cords together with the tune and melody. David moved his harp and start singing, \\"Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints. Psalm 16:15\\". Anbba Karas soul departed from his blessed body to the bosom of our Good Savior, who took it and presented it to the Michael (archangel). I, then, kissed the body of my father Anbba Karas and prepared him for burial. The Glorious Lord pointed to me to leave the cave. The Lord Jesus Christ, surrounded by His angels, left in front of my father's soul accompanied by songs and hymns. Our Glorious Lord then sealed the entrance shut, I watched as the cave entrance disappear and became part of the mountain, and they all disappeared in happiness.\\" File:Cyrus (St.AVA Karas),.jpgCyrus (Anbba Karas) References Further reading *\\"Abba Karas the Anchorite\\" Coptichymns.net. *\\"Anba Karas The Anchorite\\" Abba Antony, vol. 7, June 1997 *Pope Shenouda III. \\"Our Fathers the Anchorites\\" Category:Christian saints in unknown century Category:Coptic Orthodox saints Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Saint Karas"},{"id":"17342923","text":"A catlin or catling is a long, double-bladed surgical knife.

The exact date of construction is unknown, but it was built with rubble masonry construction which was typical of mill construction during and after the War of 1812. In 1813, Phillip Allen purchased 4.5 acres of land and constructed a mill on the site, but the first record to specifically refer to the storehouse was an insurance policy from 1836. Allen sold the property in 1857 and it changed ownership several times before it became Esmond Mills in 1906. In 1937, the building was used as a post office and described erroneously as the \\"Old Allenville Mill\\". The building has had some alterations to the front door and possibly the addition of a side door, but the interior of the structure was not detailed in the National Register of Historic Places nomination. The Allenville Mill Storehouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.  History  The Allenville Mill Storehouse is a two story square stone rubble- construction storehouse erected by Phillip Allen. The exact date of construction is unknown, but it was built with rubble-construction as was typical of mill construction during and after the War of 1812. In 1813, Allen purchased 4.5 acres from Esek Smith to construct a mill on the empty land. The exact date the mill and the storehouse was built is unknown, but Allen's brother, Zachariah, noted in his diary a payment from \\"P. Allen for building his factory\\" on March 5, 1821. The first record of the building is from an 1836 insurance policy obtained by Philip Allen for the cotton factory and a \\"Store and cloth room\\". Further evidence it was used as the storehouse comes from a lithographic map from 1858 and in the town's deeds. Allen sold the property in 1857 and it changed owners again in 1860, and was renamed to the Smithfield Manufacturing Company. Ownership changed in 1879, and it was renamed Enfield Mills and transferred again in 1906 and renamed Esmond Mills. In 1937, the building was used as a post office and described erroneously as the \\"Old Allenville Mill\\". The discovery that it was a storehouse and not the mill was made only during the National Register of Historic Places survey. In 1971, the National Register of Historic Places nomination noted that the \\"original fenestration is largely evident, although the eastern first story window of the front facade has been somewhat enlarged. This and other alterations may have occurred during the last decades of the nineteenth century or the early years of the twentieth when the building became the United States Post Office.\\" One of these alterations appears to be the side entrance on the southwestern side of the building, Candee hypothesizes that it may have replaced an original window. Another modification appears to have been made to the main entrance which has a flat pedimented front door that is framed with columns protruding on plinths. The main door is also surrounded with \\"wooden rustification\\", but it is noted that this alteration to the main entrance \\"provides an important visual point to the simple building.\\" In 1971, the National Register of Historic Places nomination did not detail the interior, but an included photo noted the windows were boarded up and it was listed as being for rent. A photo from 2013 shows that the structure has since been renovated and remains well-maintained.  Significance  The Allenville Mill Storehouse was long considered to be the Allenville Mill, including in the 1937 Federal Writer's Project book, but records indicate this was the storehouse of the mill constructed in 1813. Despite not being the mill complex, the storehouse is the earliest surviving example of the 19th-century company storehouses in Rhode Island, and one of only a few surviving examples of company storehouses remaining from the 19th century. Furthermore, the property was erected and owned by the Governor of Rhode Island and later United States Senator Phillip Allen. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

He wrote about sociology, history, art, morality, economics, epistemology and theology in a magisterial and creative way, using different genres of literature. Gonz√°lez is considered one of the most original writers of Colombia during the 20th century. His ideas were controversial and had a great influence in the Colombian society at his time and today. The Gonz√°lez work was the inspiration of Nadaism, a literary movement founded by one of his disciples, Gonzalo Arango. The Otraparte Villa, his house in Envigado, is today a museum and the headquarters of the cultural foundation to preserve and promote his legacy. The place was declared a National Patrimony of Colombia in 2006.  Biography  = Context = The children of Daniel and Pastora Gonz√°lez: Alfonso, Daniel, Alberto, Graciela, Fernando (the philosopher) and Sof√≠a. Standing up in front Jorge. A picture of 1907. Gonz√°lez lived during the beginning of the 20th century (1895‚Äì1964), a time of change, political turbulence and revolutions in industry. He was born seven years after the new political agreement of a more conservative constitution (1888) that gave great influence to the Catholic Church in Colombian society, especially in the education of future generations. Four years after, when he was 4 years old, the nation fell in a bloody civil war, the 1899 - 1902 Thousand Days War. The other important event that happened during his life was in 1903 when Colombia lost Panama. In 1926 the Banana massacre gave evidence of the labor problems of the different growing Colombian industries. He lived also in one of the first industrialist trade centers of the country, the Metropolitan Area of Medell√≠n and the first to start an industrial revolution in Colombia during the 1930s. Gonz√°lez was also a witness of the emerging of Fascism in Italy when he was consul of Colombia in that country. In 1948 the killing of the presidential candidate Jorge Eliecer Gait√°n opened the doors of a new political instability with El Bogotazo. All these events are reflected in the works and thoughts of Fernando Gonz√°lez Ochoa. = Early life = Fernando Gonz√°lez Ochoa was born in Envigado, a city in the Aburr√° Valley (Antioquia State). He was the second of seven children. His parents were Daniel Gonz√°lez and Pastora Ochoa. His father was a school teacher, the inspiration of one of his books (El Maestro de Escuela). He was expelled from the school of the Presentation Sisters of Envigado because he insulted a sister after being punished.Ernesto Ochoa Moreno: \\"Born to rebellion \\" (Spanish), from the archive gallery of Fernando Gonz√°lez, Corporaci√≥n Otraparte. Retrieved on May 10, 2008. Something similar would happen soon after he joined the Jesuit College of Medell√≠n, but this time because he was caught reading Nietzsche. The young Gonz√°lez faced his teacher of philosophy, Rev. Quiroz, saying that nothing can be and can not be at the same time. He was a sophomore in high school when the Jesuits asked him to leave the school. = Formation = The young Fernando Gonz√°lez at right with his friend Fernando Isaza in 1915. In 1915 he became a member of Los Panidas, a group of sceptics, with Le√≥n de Greiff, Ricardo Rend√≥n, F√©lix Mej√≠a Arango, Libardo Parra Toro, Jos√© Manuel Mora V√°squez and Eduardo Vasco, among other young intellectuals. In 1916 Gonz√°lez published his first book, Pensamientos de un viejo (Thoughts of an Oldman), which presentation was written by Fidel Cano, the founder of El Espectador newspaper. In 1919 Gonz√°lez got his diploma in law by University of Antioquia, however his thesis, \\"El derecho a no obedecer\\" (The Right Not To Obey) was not welcome by the Academic Council of the University. Gonz√°lez had to do some modifications to the text and published it under the title of \\"Una tesis\\" (A Thesis). = Judge = Fernando Gonz√°lez in Nevado del Ruiz Snow Mountain in 1929 during the visits that inspired his work \\"Viaje a pie\\" (\\"Trip By Foot\\"). In 1921 he became Judge of the Superior Tribunal of Manizales. In 1922 he married in Medell√≠n Margarita Restrepo Gaviria, the daughter of former president Carlos E. Restrepo. In 1928 he is nominated Second Judge of the Medell√≠n Tribunals where he knew Benjam√≠n Correa who was to be one of his best friends. With Correa he visited several towns in the states of Antioquia, Caldas and Valle del Cauca. From those visits he got the inspiration to one of his most popular books, Viaje a pie (Journey on Foot), published in 1929, but forbidden by the Archbishop of Medell√≠n under the penalty of mortal sin. Gonz√°lez went to Venezuela in 1931 to meet dictator Juan Vicente G√≥mez. He considered G√≥mez a sprout of Libertador Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and they became friends. The dictator was the godfather of one of the sons of Gonz√°lez and this one dedicated a work to him, \\"Mi compadre\\". = Consul in Italy = Gonz√°lez was nominated by President Enrique Olaya Herrera a consul of Colombia in Genoa, Italy in 1932. He went with his family to the European country and that same year Le Libre Libre, a publishing house of Paris, published his book Don Mirocletes. About that work Manuel Ugarte wrote a letter to him from Nice saying: From Spain he received two letters of Jos√© Vasconcelos on December 14 and 30, 1932. Vasconcelos wrote: He received other letter of the Colombian writer Jos√© Mar√≠a Vargas Vila, who was exiled in Madrid. Vargas wrote to him: In 1933 the Italian police found a book notes with critics to the regimen of Benito Mussolini and the Fascism. He was transferred to Marsella due to a petition of the Italian government. That book notes were the origin of his work El hermafrodita dormido (The Asleep Hermaphrodite), a book with his experiences in the classic art museums of Italy. The book was published in Spain in 1934. = Bucarest Villa = In 1934 Gonz√°lez returned to Colombia establishing in his town, Envigado, to live in a finca he called \\"Bucarest Villa\\". There he started to publish the Antioquia Magazine until 1945.Javier Henao Hidr√≥n: \\"Vivencia cronol√≥gica \\", Archive of the Otraparte Corporation. Retrieved on May 10, 2008. In 1935 the Arturo Zapata Printing Press of Manizales published his \\"El Remordimiento\\" (The Remorse), an essay in theology written in Marsella (France) and Letters to Estanislao Zuleta. The former president of Ecuador, Jos√© Mar√≠a Velasco Ibarra, who was exiled in Colombia, visited Gonz√°lez in Bucarest Villa in 1936 and they became very good friends. To Velasco he dedicated some chapters of Los negroides (The Negroid People) where Gonz√°lez called Velasco the first \\"Politician-Thinker\\" of the Americas. By his part, Velasco called Gonz√°lez in his work Conciencia o Barbarie: Ex√©gesis de la Conciencia Pol√≠tica Americana (Conscience or Barbarism: Exegesis of the American Political Conscience), published first by the Atl√°ntida Printing Press of Medell√≠n, \\"the most original and deep of the South American sociologists\\".Jos√© Mar√≠a Velasco Ibarra: Conciencia o Barbarie: Ex√©gesis de la Conciencia Pol√≠tica Americana, Medell√≠n, 1937. Republished in Buenos Aires. Spanish. Note: \\"America\\" in Spanish refers to the North and South American continents. In that year died in Madrid the Venezuelan novelist Teresa de la Parra with whom Gonz√°lez had a good friendship since 1930 when she visited him in Envigado. It was also the year of Los negroides publication, an essay on New Granada (Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador), saying that it is the only American region where the merger of races will create an original culture for a man unified. Such merger is a principle of promises and appalling realities at the same time. = Otraparte Villa = He started in 1940 the construction of his villa in Envigado that at that time he called La Huerta del Alem√°n (The Garden of the German), but the World War II would make him to change the name for Otraparte (Other Place). The villa was designed with architect Carlos Obreg√≥n, engineer F√©lix Mej√≠a Arango and painter Pedro Nel G√≥mez. That year he published \\"Santander\\", an essay about General Francisco de Paula Santander. The writer Tom√°s Carrasquilla, his friend and the most admired by him Colombian novelist, died. In Otraparte he received the American playwright Thornton Wilder to whom he dedicated his work El maestro de escuela (The School Teacher). Wilder was in Colombia as a cultural ambassador of his country in South America and wrote about the Garden of the German: \\"It is more delightful than all Chapinero\\". On April 9, 1949, Colombia shuddered with the killing of presidential candidate Jorge Eliecer Gait√°n in Bogot√°. Gonz√°lez dedicated to him some thoughts in 1936 in Los negroides: In June 1949 of that year, after El Bogotazo, Gonz√°lez wrote in the edition of his Antioquia Magazine: In 1953 he was nominated consul of Colombia in Europe, but he stayed most of the time in Bilbao where he studied Simon Bol√≠var and Ignatius of Loyola. His friend Thornton Wilder and Jean-Paul Sartre asked to include his name in the list of candidates to the Nobel Prize in Literature of 1955 and for two times he was in nominated.Jorge A. Zapata Z.: \\"Fernando Gonz√°lez Ochoa\\". Monograf√≠as.com. Retrieved on May 9, 2008. The writers Gabriela Mistral, Jacinto Benavente and Miguel de Unamuno admired his work. In September 1957 Gonz√°lez returned to Colombia, to his Otraparte villa, until his death in 1964.

He thought about the Colombian man and, thus, the Latin American, their personality, fights and expressions. He called himself the \\"Philosopher of the Personality of South America\\". He wrote that the Latin American man might develop the individuality to arise from their anonymity. He criticized what he called the Latin American vanity that was without substance and invited to express the personality with energy, giving to life the highest value. Gonz√°lez thought his time as the decadence of the principle of freedom and individualism for an action of flocks following calves to worship (Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini). He missed the man of the ancient Egypt, Greece and the Renaissance man.

He announced on Radio Moscow all major international events in the 1940s‚Äì60s including the German attack on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, the surrender of Germany on 9 May 1945, the death of Joseph Stalin on 5 March 1953, and the first manned spaceflight on 12 April 1961. Biography Born in a Jewish family in Vladimir to a tailor and a housewife, Levitan traveled to Moscow in the early 1930s, hoping to become an actor, but was rejected because of his provincial accent. However, he secured a position on a Moscow radio-station owing to his characteristic deep voice. In January 1934, after hearing Levitan broadcasting, Joseph Stalin called up the radio station and requested that from then on Levitan read his announcements. Consequently, Levitan became not only the personal announcer for Stalin, but the leading Soviet radio personality. After the German invasion (22 June 1941) Levitan was evacuated (autumn 1941) to Sverdlovsk - Moscow radio stations were taken down to avoid German bombardment. At the time he lived in a secret location due to his importance as the nation's foremost radio personality. In March 1943 he was secretly transported to Kuybyshev, where the met. During all those years away from Moscow, his reports began with his trademark \\"Attention, this is Moscow speaking!\\" () Levitan made some 2000 radio announcements during the war; he recorded recreations of many of them in the 1950s, when he reproduced them in studio for archiving purposes. After the war, Levitan reported events in Red Square and state proclamations. Between 1978 and 1983 he announced the annual \\"Minute of Silence\\" to commemorate Victory Day in the Soviet Union.

The river forms the border between Cranston and Coventry. The first bridge to span the Pawtuxet River at this location was an early nineteenth century wooden bridge, located in the city of Cranston. In 1887, a special resolution was passed changing the Coventry- Cranston border to the Pawtuxet River. A new iron bridge was commissioned in 1888 by a joint building committee from both Coventry and Cranston and the responsibility for maintenance of the new bridge was to be shared by both municipalities. The bridge was built in 1888 by Dean & Westbrook for the Town of Coventry and the Interlaken MillsInformation taken from bridge sign. (later known as the Arkwright Mills). It is the longest surviving 19th century truss bridge in Rhode Island,\\"Great American Bridges and Dams: A National Trust Guide\\" by Donald C. Jackson - 1988, pg. 101 (accessed on Google Books) and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The bridge is 128 feet, 6 inches long; 19 feet, 7 inches wide; and has and a depth of truss of 21 feet. The bridge is a single-span, through Pratt truss, built using Phoenix columns. In 2004, there was a proposal to move the Arkwright Bridge to another location along the Pawtuxet River along the border of West Warwick, Rhode Island to be part of a proposed West Warwick Riverwalk. The bridge was ultimately not moved. The Rhode Island Department of Transportation recommended closure of the locally owned bridge, and following an inspection, determined that the weight limit should be reduced to less than 3 tons from the previous 5 tons. Both communities closed the 123-year-old span on Friday, September 30, 2011. The bridge continues to be a popular jumping and swimming spot for local youth, with approximately 12 feet of air and an average 15 feet of water.

Oil on wood, 116 √ó 75 cm. In the collection of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum. Formerly attributed to the Master of the Imhoff Altar, this painting is now believed to be by the Master of the Bamberg Altar The Master of the Bamberg Altar (fl. ca. 1420-1440) was a German painter active in the Nuremberg area. His name is derived from an altarpiece depicting scenes from the Passion, painted in 1429 for the Franciscan church in Bamberg; this may be seen today in the Bavarian National Museum in Munich. Stylistically, the painting appears to be descended from the work of the Nuremberg Master of the Altarpiece of the Virgin. The Master collaborated with the Master of the Imhoff Altar in the creation of the eponymous altarpiece; his depiction of the Man of Sorrows with the Virgin and Saint John forms the reverse panel. This is a characteristic example of his solemn and simple style. Another, more restrained work is the Man of Sorrows Standing with the Virgin, today in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum. The Master of the Bamberg Altar seems to have depended strongly on facial types and figure styles derived from Bohemian painting; he seems especially to have known the work of the Master of the T≈ôebo≈à Altarpiece, although his figures are more block-like and solid and less elegant than those of the latter artist. He would appear to be moving away from the International Gothic and towards a more Italian- derived style, based especially on work from Altichiero. Among the local artists who appear to have derived some of their style from the Master is Sebald Bopp. References *Master of the Bamberg Altar Category:Gothic painters Category:15th-century German painters Bamberg Altar, Master of the ","title":"Master of the Bamberg Altar"},{"id":"17343320","text":"Arnold Mills Historic District is a historic district encompassing a modest 19th-century mill village in eastern Cumberland, Rhode Island.

He primarily played at , and remains fourth on the list of most first-grade games played for Souths, 208. Playing career Coleman was graded to South Sydney as a seventeen-year-old in 1980. In 1981 he played in the under-23 side coached by Brian Smith which lost only two games in the season and won the Grand Final at the Sydney Cricket Ground. He made his first-grade d√©but for South Sydney in round 14 of the 1982 season, playing off the bench against the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs at Redfern Oval. His first match at halfback was in round 22 of the 1982 season against Peter Sterling, and the Parramatta Eels at Redfern Oval. During his eleven seasons with Souths, Coleman spent three off-seasons playing in England - Widnes, Hull FC and Leeds. After he was released by Souths at the end of the 1992 season, he played a fourth off-season in England, for Salford. Due to his late return to Australia (after the 1 February signing deadline), Coleman was unable to sign with the Gold Coast for the 1993 season. He threatened to take the Australian Rugby League to court when he was denied the clearance but spent the year playing park football for the Coogee Wombats in Souths' A-grade competition. He was back in first grade in 1994 with the Gold Coast Seagulls, and finished his first-grade career playing one season for the Western Suburbs Magpies in 1996 under coach, Tommy Raudonikis. Coaching career Coleman returned to the Rabbitohs as a reserve-grade coach and took over from Steve Martin as first-grade coach in round 19 of the 1998 season. In 2000, the Rabbitohs were excluded from the National Rugby League competition. Coleman, while working as a baggage handler for Ansett, joined the fight to have the club included in the competition. On the club's return in the 2002 season, Coleman was once again head coach but after a poor season the South Sydney board considered his position in late September. A split decision opted to retain Coleman as coach but revised the coaching staff, appointing Phil Blake (former Souths utility player) as the club's new coaching coordinator with Paul Langmack appointed as defensive coach. Five months later and only eleven days before the official start of the 2003 season, Coleman was sacked by the club after a series of losses in the pre-season trials. Under his coaching, the Rabbitohs won 17 of 54 games (31%) over three playing seasons. 1999 was the most successful of Coleman's coaching seasons in NRL, with the Rabbitohs narrowly missing the semi finals.

Phyllis Freeman and Anthony Robbins, co-editors of the Journal of Public Health Policy (JPHP), first suggested the name and concept in 2004 and published \\"Closing the ‚Äòpublishing gap‚Äô between rich and poor\\" about AuthorAID on the Science and Development Network (SciDev.Net), Science and Development Network in 2005.Freeman P, Robbins A. Closing the ‚Äòpublishing gap‚Äô between rich and poor. ‚Äò‚ÄòSciDev.Net‚Äô‚Äô 2 September 2005. Accessed 4 May 2008 Development aid programs of international organizations, industrial countries, and charitable foundations have invested in strengthening research capacity in developing countries to help those countries solve their own problems. Scientists from developing countries, however, remain under-represented as authors in the published scientific literature. AuthorAID was proposed because unless research results from authors anywhere are available through publication, the full benefit of investment in research is not achieved. AuthorAID programs engage senior scientists and author‚Äôs editors as mentors to help developing country researchers overcome barriers to publication in scientific journals. The internet connects mentors and authors where it is not possible to have face- to-face contact. The funded AuthorAID program at the International Network for the Availability of Scientific Publications also organizes workshops in various developing countries, in addition to hosting an online mentoring scheme and e-resources. AuthorAID at INASP. Supporting developing country researchers in publishing their work AuthorAID at INASP is independent of the other AuthorAID programs and is described below.  The publishing gap  Scientific research is conducted all over the world, and increasingly in developing countries. In an effort to help countries solve problems and speed development, development aid has been invested in research capacity, notably by Sweden Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency and Canada. International Development Research Centre The results of this research must be available through publication to be useful in economic development and to other researchers. Yet only an extremely small fraction of the scientific literature is written by developing world authors, even in fields such as health and environmental studies, where it is universally recognized that the world‚Äôs dominant problems manifest themselves in developing regions. An analysis, published in Science in 2005, of 4061 health-related journals from 1992 to 2001 showed a growing gap in scientific publications between low- income countries and the rest of the world. Similarly, Athula Sumathipala and her colleagues found under-representation of developing world authors in leading medical journals such as the BMJ, Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, and JAMA, in 1999 and 2000. = Causes of under-representation = There is no single cause of the under- representation of developing world authors. Bias exists on the part of both editors and reviewers who choose what to publish. Frank Gannon, Frank Gannon writing as the editor of EMBO Reports, EMBO Reports pointed out one worrisome source of bias against researchers from developing countries. He suggested that editors and reviewers discriminate \\"by judging colleagues on their work address\\" noting that \\"[t]he address of the first or last authors is not always a neutral piece of information when assessing a paper.\\"Gannon F. Address bias (editorial). EMBO Reports 2007; 8(5):421. Accessed 22 April 2008 Differences in publication priorities between developed and developing countries are not always a sign of bias. The editors of a guide to publishing in the addiction sciences noted that \\"US research is primarily (and legitimately) oriented towards that country‚Äôs own social and economic priorities, which do not necessarily apply to cultures in the developing world. The problem of US dominance is thus not only one of maldistribution of opportunity.\\"Barbor TF, Stenius K, Savva S (editors). Publishing addiction science: a guide for the perplexed. International Society of Addiction Journal Editors/World Health Organization. Accessed 23 April 2008 Some writers, analyzing the issues of science information transfer from a sociolinguistic and sociopolitical standpoint, consider this cultural dominance to reflect an \\"Anglo-American English language hegemony.\\" The problem is further compounded by variations in the quality of the feedback peer reviewers are able to provide about the language and writing, since this advice does not always help to make the writing better. Writing in English, overwhelmingly the language of scientific publication, constitutes a problem that can make it difficult for non-native English speakers (NNS) to \\"compete on an equal research basis.\\" In the early 1990s Gosden surveyed editors if biology, chemistry and physics journals to identify aspects of manuscripts \\"which may seriously detract attention from judgment of a paper‚Äôs essential merits.\\" He found that journal editors reported several problems encountered by NNS researchers, including inadequate knowledge of the unwritten \\"rules of the publication game\\" (for instance, failure to cite sufficient references to earlier research and unfamiliarity with the argumentation style or scientific level of the journal.) The editors of the addiction sciences publishing guide mentioned above noted that international publishing requires technical skill to follow the instructions to authors, and is \\"an acquired competence in social communication.\\" They warned that \\"if the formalities are not followed, even a study containing strong and original findings might immediately be turned down.\\" One potential obstacle to acceptance is that \\"many English-speaking editors and reviewers (in the same way as many French, German, or Swedish speaking editors) will have a rather strict idea of what constitutes good language.\\" = The problem as encountered by authors = Freeman and Robbins, when developing the AuthorAID concept, summarized what they learned about the problems faced by authors in developing countries as: * Uncertainty about which journals may be suitable for a submission * Unfamiliarity with editorial conventions * Persistent pressure to write in English * Conflicts with collaborators about authorship and author order * Lack of scientific and statistical tools to analyze data as required by journals * Editors‚Äô and publishers‚Äô inattention to development problems and developing country topics. Editors and other research publication experts might help researchers overcome linguistic challenges and cultural differences, and help them understand the procedural, ethical, and technical intricacies of academic publication. Freeman and Robbins reported that in developing world research institutions there are simply too few editor/scientist mentors (well-published authors or experienced editors) available to assist in disseminating the work of emerging research talent whose findings might be brought to bear on the world‚Äôs major problems. = The problem as seen by journal editors = Editors of international journals reported to Freeman and Robbins that they sometimes reject submissions from developing country authors even when the content shows merit. Some noted that despite investment in research capacity in developing countries, many manuscripts reflect inadequate attention to research design and analysis. Conflicting priorities and lack of resources to provide substantive editing have also been discussed as a potential source of bias by members of the World Association of Medical Editors (WAME). World Association of Medical Editors Editors in WAME who work with researchers as well as those who tend the gates at journals noted that the chances of acceptance may be lower for manuscripts needing more rather than less editing work.Value of technical editing. WAME listserve discussion, March 2‚Äì8, 2005. http://www.wame.org/resources/wame- listserve-discussions/value-of-technical-editing/. Accessed 21 March 2008 At smaller journals in particular, manuscripts are likely to be rejected if they seem to require more editing than the editors or publisher can afford to provide. Another potential source of bias is perceived narrowness of scope: some editors lament the paucity of submissions sufficiently broad in scope to warrant international dissemination. Manuscripts that report research on a local or regional topic are often rejected by international journals before the editors have carefully scrutinized the research design and data collection. Journal editors from the Forum of African Medical Editors (FAME) Forum of African Medical Editors and the Eastern Mediterranean Association of Medical Editors (EMAME), Eastern Mediterranean Association of Medical Editors both of which are supported by the World Health Organization, report they do most of the editorial tasks themselves, and have little time to assist authors with substantial revisions. Lack of editorial staff to help authors may prolong the review process or result in rejection of manuscripts whose research findings could be applied to solving practical problems or to further research. = The problem as viewed by publishers = The tradition of intensive editing in many fields and at many scholarly journals and publishing houses (see academic publishing) has given way to commercial imperatives to produce at lower cost more \\"content\\" that can be repackaged and resold or licensed to others to generate additional revenue. To reduce costs, publishers have pushed greater editorial responsibility upon authors. Journals proliferate, but editorial resources are often strained, leading to a propensity to accept manuscripts that require less work. This may impose an additional burden on readers trying to understand the published articles. Research institutions in wealthy countries have responded to this new publishing environment. Where no in-house editorial service exists, elite institutions often buy editorial help for their researchers from freelance editors or specialized firms. Few, if any, developing world institutions have in-house editorial services or external editors. In some models of open access publishing the author pays the publisher a \\"manuscript processing fee,\\" which contributes little revenue to invest in editing. These fees tend to exclude less affluent authors from the start. However, not all models of open access publishing require financial support from authors, and some open access publishers waive their fees when payment would represent a hardship for authors.  History  The editors of the Journal of Public Health Policy (JPHP) first presented the AuthorAID idea, provisionally named EditAID, at a meeting of the World Federation of Public Health Associations in Brighton, England in April 2004. Public health professionals from the federation‚Äôs 69 national associations expressed interest in the AuthorAID concept. Some wanted to benefit from mentoring and others offered to help scientists with less writing experience. The second public presentation of AuthorAID took place in Mexico in November 2004 at the Global Forum for Health Research. Global Forum for Health Research This allowed AuthorAID‚Äôs developers to reach a group closer to the intended users, i.e., researchers from developing countries plus national and international agencies that invest in research. Robbins and Jerry Spiegel, a Canadian colleague from the Canadian Coalition for Global Health Research, Canadian Coalition for Global Health Research talked to the forum about the potential benefits of AuthorAID.Freeman P, Spiegel J, Robbins A, Neufeld V.

In the wake of this experience, interest focussed on the search for more substantial ways to test the AuthorAID concept. Many editors of US scientific journals were, at the time, engaged in activities to support developing world journal editors and their publications.Tillet T.

Ana Marusic, Ana Marusic co- editor of the Croatian Medical Journal, Croatian Medical Journal organized a special session on AuthorAID. Editors from FAME encouraged CSE to participate in AuthorAID. CSE‚Äôs board voted to develop the concept into a CSE project. Paul Bozuwa of Dartmouth Journal Services, Paul Bozuwa who chaired a CSE Task Force on Science Journals, Poverty, and Human Development, took the lead for CSE on AuthorAID. The Science and Development Network posted an article by the JPHP editors in its Opinions section describing AuthorAID to the broader science and development communities.Freeman P, Robbins A.

Accessed 1 April 2008 The JPHP editors followed up with an editorial in their journal in which they explained the problems faced by developing world researchers when they try to publish their work in scientific journals. In 2006, AuthorAID experiments started to take shape. Certain central elements remain constant across the experiments. AuthorAID is not commercial, relying exclusively on volunteer scientific and editorial mentors to help developing world authors. All AuthorAID projects match mentors (senior scientists with editorial experience often in or near retirement, or experienced science editors) with researchers seeking help to present their work. Mentors forswear authorship, agreeing to accept acknowledgment from the researchers whom they assist. Together the mentors and authors work on a manuscript via the internet or e-mail (unless they are able to meet in person) through to publication. The European Association of Science Editors (EASE) European Association of Science Editors invited a presentation of AuthorAID at its 2006 Annual Meeting in Krak√≥w, Poland and subsequently endorsed the concept.

The AuthorAID in the Eastern Mediterranean website was inaugurated in late October 2012. Experienced volunteer editors who contribute their time to AAEM are located in several countries and edit research manuscripts at no cost to the authors. In Iran, the project has provided manuscript editing combined with training in writing, revising, good scientific English style, appropriate referencing and citation, and research publication ethics. Sets of AAEM advice developed for authors and editors cover aspects of technical editing such as abbreviations, reference formats and identifying sources of materials, as well as aspects of research writing and publication such as plagiarism, self- plagiarism, appropriate secondary publication and choosing the most appropriate journal. While the next on-site phase of AAEM is being planned, its volunteers continue to provide manuscript editing support via email for researchers in the Eastern Mediterranean region.

The group consists of Carnage the Executioner and Desdamona. History Ill Chemistry's members, Desdamona and Carnage the Executioner met in 1998 at a cafe in Minneapolis's Dinkytown neighborhood, where they exchanged lyrics. Carnage was recognized for his beatboxing abilities and Desdamona was gaining fame in the Minneapolis music scene. Each were performing separately, but sometime after they met, Carnage began to beatbox for Desdamona, taking the place of a DJ. They began to perform as a group after that. As they bonded as a musical act, the group lacked a name which Carnage said was, \\"because it was really organic. Literally, not practiced.\\" One fan commented that the group had \\"Ill Chemistry\\", and when the duo heard the phrase come from the mouths of multiple fans across the city, they chose it as their name. Carnage also noted that the name was powerful because of the chemistry he and Desdamona share as a musical group. In October, 2007, the group was hired to do filler acts at Minneapolis's Black Dog Cafe's Black Dog Block Party. However, a thunderstorm nearly halted the event, so to keep people from leaving, the group got onstage and started performing with the thunder as an additional beat. Choreographer Andrew Rist, a co-founder of Ballet Minnesota, went home and choreographed dances to several of the duo's songs as part of his Black Dog Cafe ballet project. Instead of playing the tracks from a CD, Ill Chemistry performed live onstage next to the dancers. In 2006, the group was nominated for \\"Best Hip Hop Artist/Group\\" in the Minnesota Music Awards. in December 2011, they make their first French appearance at Les Allum√©s du Jazz in Le Mans and in Campus- Terrain d'Entente in Paris. Then in February 2012, they play their first official show at Sons d'Hiver opening for David Krakauer two months before their first French tour in April. In this first French tour they are performing twice in Paris and then in Strasbourg, Nancy, Nantes, Dijon, and above all in Bourges for the famous Printemps de Bourges. Ill Chemistry's previously unreleased track, \\"Hold On\\", was one of 31 songs released in the For New Orleans two-disc compilation. The CD, released on 2007 Apr 24, was sold to benefit the New Orleans Musicians' Village project. Desdamona and Carnage have also released CDs individually, some of which include guest appearances by the other. In 2012, Ill Chemistry's self-titled first album was released on Nato in France.

(RWITC) is an exclusive Indian sports club for horse racing, established in 1800. Which runs the Mahalaxmi Racecourse in Mumbai and the Pune Race Course.  History  The Royal Western India Turf Club has a history spanning just over two centuries. It conducts racing at Mumbai's Mahalaxmi Racecourse (from November to April), including the Indian Derby in February and Pune (from July to October), while Delhi races under its Rules. Its first meeting was held 10-11 January 1798, with two plates run in heats. Breakfast was served on the high grounds opposite Colonel Jones‚Äô house and Captain G. Hall saluted the last race with fifteen guns. Captain G. Hall, Sir Charles Forbes, A. Campbell, P. Hadow and others formed the Bombay Turf Club in 1802 and they acquired land in Byculla to conduct racing; the balcony of the clubhouse was used as a private stand for the Members. Shortly thereafter the name was changed to the Western India Turf Club. For the major part of the nineteenth century, racing continued to be held at Byculla until in 1883 the venue was shifted to Mahalakshmi on land made available by Sir C N Wadia. The race course was originally built under the direction and supervision of Major J E Hughes. During this time Calcutta held the upper hand in Indian racing, but as the twentieth century dawned, Bombay became the \\"City of Gold.\\" The first running of the Eclipse Stakes of India in 1923 gave Bombay a race to rival the Viceroy‚Äôs Cup. New stands were commissioned in 1925 and then in 1935, King George V bestowed the privilege of prefixing the club‚Äôs name with \\"Royal.\\" The club also featured other royal dignitaries such as the Queen of England, the Shah of Iran, and the King of Saudi Arabia. In 1943 the first Indian Classics were run and when 21 years later the Indian Turf Invitation Cup came into being, Mahalakshmi was the chosen venue for its first running. Pune, 3 hours drive south-east of Bombay, the other centre at which the Royal Western India Turf Club conducts its racing is quite different. It is a monsoon track and is where the main Club House (with accommodation and ballroom) is. The track is tighter and has a shorter run-in, with the variable underfoot conditions making for some unexpected results. Many horses from Calcutta traditionally come over to Pune for their \\"summer spelling\\" and get ready for the big Cup Races on their home turf in the winter. As of June 30th, 2010 the club had 7566 members. As of July 15th, 2010 the club had 600 owners, 46 licensed trainers, and 80 Jockeys. The club typically houses around 1400 horses in training at Mumbai's Mahalaxmi Racecourse. In June 2019, the club called for reduction of betting taxes and involvement of celebrities in its activities to attract more youngsters to the sport of horse racing. According to the existing tax regime, for every 100 rupees that is wagered, 28 rupees goes to the government as Goods and Services Tax (India).https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/low-betting- taxes-celeb-guests-how-rwitc-aims-to-attract-mumbai-millennials-to-horse- racing/articleshow/69781330.cms?from=mdr  Membership  The club‚Äôs membership stands at about 7,850 with the \\"club\\" class (the only category allowed to vote) members at 1,675. Broadly speaking, the categories of membership are: Life, Club, Stand and Invitee. Interviews are taken by club authorities before membership is approved. Being prominent personality or a politician does not give you direct pass to membership. Existing members can object and reject club membership during the interview stage.

He studied there for 12 years, completing his schooling in 1971 with a GPA of 5.8 (from 1-7). Years later, he says ‚ÄúIf it wasn‚Äôt for this school, I wouldn‚Äôt have lived in Germany and met my wife. DSV taught me to be disciplined and serious with what I do, to not waste time, to take difficult situations in stride, to be frugal and simple, and to experience and live in other cultures.‚ÄùLos mejores colegios de Chile Ex alumnos destacados, hablan los ex alumnos, en emol.cl In addition, he thanks DSV for helping him to become closer to writers such as Goethe, Schiller, Brecht, and Mann, and remembers that the school ‚Äúmarked my decision to travel the world with my nomadic soul.‚Äù After living 17 years in Valparaiso, Ampuero moved in 1972 to the capital of the country, Santiago, to matriculate into the University of Chile. There he studied Social Anthropology in the mornings and Latin American Literature in the afternoons. Around this time, he became a member of the Chilean Communist Youth. He says that ‚ÄúWhen I was young, I was a part of the Communist Youth because I believed that the socialism was democratic, just, and economically prosperous.‚ÄùEntrevista a Roberto Ampuero En Revista Capital, art√≠culo correspondiente al n√∫mero 236 (5 al 16 de septiembre de 2008) After the coup d'√©tat at the end of September in 1973, he decided to depart for East Germany. Exile to Cuba (1973‚Äì1979) Thanks to a contact in the Eastern German Embassy, he left Chile in 1973 after receiving a scholarship for journalism in the University of Karl Marx in Leipzig. In Eastern Germany he met Margarita Flores, daughter of Fernando Flores Ibarra, attorney general of the Cuban Revolution, with whom he left to live together in Cuba. They arrived at the island in 1974 and that same year they got married. However, this marriage only lasted until 1977. In this period his political thought began to change. In an interview with Michael Moody in 1999 he says ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just that there was a lack of dialogue, but that the government despised the opposition, making them the enemy. I came from a country where it was a tradition to have dialogue, to have liberty. We had tried to restore the socialism, but now there was a dictatorship and what the people most criticized was that the dictator declared everyone against him an enemy of the state, and therefore you have to incarcerate them, shoot them, or expel them out of the country. When I arrived in Cuba I discovered that the government did the same to the opposition and that they didn‚Äôt have dialogue either.‚ÄùMoody, Michael, Roberto Ampuero y la novela negra, una entrevista, citado en La Narrativa de Roberto Ampuero en la Globalizaci√≥n Cultural, por Gioconda Mar√∫n, p√°gina 10 In 2008 he remembered that: ‚ÄúWhen I arrived in Cuba in 1974 and I saw the economic disaster I thought that it was as much a democracy as I am a Martian, I said to myself ‚Äòthis is not the country I want! I quit the JJCC (communist youth) in 1976 in La Habana where everything was going on.‚Äù In 1977 Ampuero obtained the Premio Lautaro de Cuentos (Short Stories Prize) from the Comit√© de la Resistencia Chilena, La Habana, and in 1978 he received the Menci√≥n Concurso de Cuentos 13 de Marzo. Then in 1979 he obtained a B.A. in Latin American Literature and left Cuba. East Germany (1979‚Äì1983) After five years in La Habana, in 1979 he returned to East Germany. There he attended the ‚ÄúEscuela Juvenil Superior Wilhelm Pieck‚Äù (JHSWP), nicknamed the ‚ÄúRed Monastery,‚Äù next to Berlin and the Bogensee lake. There with other Chileans, he got a Marxist education for a year, studying Marxist and Leninist doctrine. He was a member of the ‚ÄúUni√≥n de J√≥venes Dem√≥cratas‚Äù(UJD), of liberal inspiration. Ampuero remembered that ‚Äúthe JHSWP wasn‚Äôt a Punto Cero of military training like the ones that are in Cuba, Bulgaria, Libya, but a school of ideological thinking, but many others started believing in the idea that the only way was to resort to arms.Mis a√±os de posgrado revolucionario en la RDA por Roberto Ampuero en revista Qu√© Pasa. He enrolled in the Humboldt University where he took postgraduate courses in literature, economics, and politics until 1983. During these years he worked as a translator.

He was president of the Law Society of England and Wales. He and his elder brother, Percy Melmoth Walters, were known as \\"morning\\" and \\"afternoon\\" in allusion to their initials. The brothers were generally regarded as the finest fullbacks in England for a number of years; according to Philip Gibbons in his \\"History of the Game from 1863 to 1900\\" this was due mainly to their own defensive system based on the combination game used by the Royal Engineers during the early 1870s. Family and education Walters was born in Ewell, Surrey, the son of William Melmoth Walters (1835‚Äì1926), a solicitor and member of an old Somerset family, and Marian Eleanor Leggatt (b. 1840). He was educated at Windlesham House School, then Charterhouse where he played for the school football team in 1882 and 1883 before going up to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he won a blue in each of the years from 1884 to 1887. In 1892, he married Amy Constance Parbury, the daughter of G. W. Parbury, of Ifield, Crawley and they had 5 sons and 4 daughters, including Amy (born 1894), Anthony (1895), Herbert (1900), Bridget (1914) and Thomas (1917) and Marion Elizabeth (born 1901). Arthur Melmoth Walters (Footballer and president of the Law Society) Football career =Corinthian= In his first year at Cambridge, Walters joined the Corinthian club which had been established two years earlier with a view to giving amateur players the opportunity to play together on a regular basis to improve the quality and strength of the England team. Arthur made his debut for Corinthian on 13 November 1884, in a 7‚Äì1 defeat by Notts Club. He was unable to take part in the Corinthians tour of northern England in December, but was able to join the Easter tour in which five games were played in six days. Arthur played in four of the five games, including the opening fixture against Preston North End on 6 April 1885, when he played at left-back with his brother Percy alongside him on the right. This match was the first of many over the next six years in which the two brothers played alongside each other as the two full backs. Amongst the more significant matches were a 6‚Äì0 defeat of the FA Cup holders, Blackburn Rovers, in December 1885 and a 7‚Äì0 victory over Notts County in March 1886, when fellow Old Carthusian William Cobbold scored four goals. The brothers' final match together for Corinthian was on 8 November 1890 in an eight-goal victory over Sheffield in which younger brother H.M. Walters (who was only playing his second match) scored a hat-trick, with another goal from Percy. The other four goals came from V.G. Manns, who was playing his only match for Corinthian. Shortly after this match, the younger brother died from a football injury inflicted during a match and, in deference to their parents' wishes, both brothers retired from football to concentrate on their legal careers. The withdrawal of the Walters brothers from the Corinthian team had a significant effect on the team's performances as they were \\"extremely hard to replace, and Corinthian were destined to win only six of their next nineteen games\\". Despite the promise made to their parents, the brothers made a return to the Corinthians for a multi-sport tournament against the Barbarians rugby club in April 1892. Arthur played in the soccer match (without Percy) which Corinthian won 6‚Äì0, with Tinsley Lindley scoring a hat-trick. The clubs also played a rugby match, which Corinthian won 16‚Äì13, although the match was not a very serious encounter and was described by The Times newspaper as \\"a very amusing game\\".Quoted in The rugby match was followed by an athletics meeting in which C. B. Fry was prominent, winning both the long jump and high jump. Finally, the two clubs met a few weeks later in a cricket match in which Percy played alongside several other prominent Corinthians, including Fry, Lindley and Charles Wreford-Brown. Arthur's final Corinthian matches came when he made a brief come-back at the end of the 1892‚Äì93 season with appearances against Bournemouth and Queen's Park. During his time with the Corinthians, Walters made 48 appearances, scoring once. =Old Carthusians= After graduating in 1887, Walters joined the old-boys' team for his former school, the Old Carthusians. His major successes came late in his time with the club, reaching successive FA Amateur Cup finals, winning the cup in 1894, the competition's inaugural year, and reaching the final in 1895. =England= Arthur and Percy made their England debuts together on 28 February 1885 in a 4‚Äì0 victory over Ireland, with Arthur at right back and Percy on the left.England 4 ‚Äì Ireland 0; 28 February 1885 (Match summary) In the match against Scotland on 27 March 1886, nine of the eleven players selected were members of the Corinthian club, although all had their primary affiliation with other clubs. The match ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw, with England's being scored by fellow Corinthian Tinsley Lindley.Scotland 1 ‚Äì England 1; 27 March 1886 (Match summary) Arthur made a total of nine appearances for England, with the final match being against Scotland in the 1890 British Home Championship. The match ended 1‚Äì1,Scotland 1 ‚Äì England 1; 5 April 1890 (Match summary) and as a result England and Scotland shared the championship. Of the nine matches played for England, four were won, three drawn (all against Scotland) and two were lost (also against Scotland). Life away from sport Walters spent some time as a volunteer in the army, and in August 1886, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in the 3rd Surrey Rifles. Walters eventually qualified as a solicitor in 1899, and joined the family firm. He was president of the Law Society of England and Wales. He became a director of the London Guarantee and Accident Co., and of the Phoenix Assurance Co. He died at his home at Minnickwood, Holmwood, Surrey on 2 May 1941 aged 76.

In 2006 it had an area of 5.9 km2 and was inhabited by 20,595 people. On January 12, 2006 a part of it was split off to form a new district, Czarny Las.  History  Originally, the area belonged to Koch≈Çowice. First a settlement called Nowa Wie≈õ (lit. New Village) was established. Wirek would later developed around Antonienh√ºtte ironworks, opened in 1805, and became a separate municipality in 1828. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the settlement grew owing to industrial development. A school was opened in 1856; a Roman Catholic church in 1874; and a year later, a rail connection with Chebzie was constructed. The municipality lost its independence in 1870. In 1921, Wirek became part of Polish Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship. In 1924 Nowa Wie≈õ again absorbed Wirek. A town hall was built in years 1929‚Äì1930. During World War II, it was occupied by Germany. In 1948 Nowa Wie≈õ was renamed to Wirek.

Akui (January 16, 1920 ‚Äì September 15, 1987) was an American soldier who became famous for capturing the first Japanese prisoner of war in World War II. At the time, Akui was a corporal in Company G, 298th Infantry Regiment of the Hawaii National Guard. Biography :This section appears to be missing information. If you have a reliable source that documents the rest of his life, please add it in. Hawaiian native Akui enlisted on 15 October 1940 and would serve in the Pacific theater until its end. On December 8, 1941, the morning after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Akui and Lieutenant Paul C. Plybonwas were walking along Waimanalo Beach when Akui found a Japanese man lying unconscious on the beach. The man awoke to find Akui standing over him with a drawn pistol. Akui took the man into custody and he was identified as Ensign Kazuo Sakamaki, commander of a two-man midget submarine that took part in the Pearl Harbor attacks. Ensign Sakamaki's submarine's gyrocompass was malfunctioning and caused the submarine to sail in circles at periscope depth. Sakamaki thus ran aground on a reef, where the United States Navy destroyer spotted it and opened fire. The destroyer's gunners missed, but the blasts freed the submarine from the reef and Sakamaki was able to submerge. When he could not repair the gyrocompass, Sakamaki ordered Petty Officer 2nd Class Kiyoshi Inagaki to swim ashore, while he set the demolition charges to destroy the submarine. Sakamaki then abandoned ship himself. Inagaki drowned attempting to swim ashore. Sakamaki succeeded, but passed out from exhaustion. Corporal Akui found him there. Sakamaki's demolition charges failed to explode and his submarine also washed ashore. It was salvaged and is now in the Admiral Nimitz Museum at Fredericksburg, Texas. Akui served through the remainder of the war in the Pacific Theater and was a member of the famed \\"Merrill's Marauders\\", who fought the Japanese in the jungles of Burma.http://ibiblio.net/hyperwar/USA/USA-CBI-Time/USA-CBI-Time-7.html He retired from the United States Army as a master sergeant and spent the rest of his life in Hawaii.

Known as Veirs Mill Road, the highway runs from MD 28 and MD 911 in Rockville east to MD 97 in Wheaton. MD 586 is a four- to six-lane northwest-southeast highway through southern Montgomery County. The highway was originally constructed in the mid-1930s. MD 586 was expanded to a divided highway in the mid-1950s. Route description Rock Creek crossing View west along MD 586 at MD 193 in Wheaton MD 586 begins at the intersection of Veirs Mill Road and First Street in Rockville. MD 28 heads west along Veirs Mill Road across CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision toward downtown Rockville; the highway also heads north along First Street toward Norbeck. MD 911 heads south along First Street under the railroad toward North Bethesda. Access from MD 586 to northbound and southbound MD 355 (Rockville Pike) on the west side of the railroad tracks is via MD 28 and MD 911, respectively. MD 586 heads east as a four-lane divided highway through the eastern part of the city of Rockville. The highway is paralleled by service roads east to Twinbrook Parkway, east of which the highway leaves the city limits and crosses Rock Creek. Between the creek and Aspen Hill Road, MD 586 is crossed by a sweeping pedestrian bridge that carries the Rock Creek Hiker-Biker Trail. MD 586 parallels Rock Creek southeast along the southern edge of Aspen Hill. After crossing Turkey Branch where the route intersects the linear Matthew Henson State Park, the highway leaves the valley of Rock Creek and expands to six lanes ahead of its intersection with Randolph Road. Local streets are used to circumvent the lack of direct access from eastbound Randolph Road to westbound MD 586 and from westbound Randolph Road to eastbound MD 586. East of Randolph Road, the two directions of the highway change from two to three lanes and back intermittently. MD 586 continues southeast and intersects MD 185 (Connecticut Avenue) just west of its crossing of an unnamed branch of Rock Creek. The highway enters the town center of Wheaton shortly before its intersection with MD 193 (University Boulevard). MD 586 passes between the Westfield Wheaton shopping mall and the Wheaton station on the Washington Metro's Red Line before reaching its eastern terminus at MD 97 (Georgia Avenue). There is no direct access from MD 586 to northbound MD 97. MD 586 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial for its entire length. History MD 586 near Turkey Branch looking east toward Randolph Road Veirs Mill Road is named for a grist and sawmill on Rock Creek built by Samuel Clark Veirs in 1838 and operated by his family until 1924. This mill drew business from Rockville and Mitchell's Crossroads, which later became Wheaton, along its namesake road. MD 586 was constructed starting in 1934. By the end of 1935, the highway was paved as a macadam road from MD 97 northwest to a branch of Rock Creek next to the modern MD 586-MD 185 intersection. Two segments of concrete road were also completed from the end of the macadam segment northwest to Turkey Branch and from First Street Rockville southeast to Edmonston Drive in Rockville. The remainder of the highway was completed in 1937 concurrent with Veirs Mill Road's original bridge across the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (now CSX) between First Street and U.S. Route 240 (now MD 355). MD 28 was relocated east on Veirs Mill Road across the new bridge, then north on First Street when the project was complete. Expansion of MD 586 to a four- lane divided highway began in 1954. The first segment of the expanded highway, from just east of MD 28 in Rockville to Turkey Branch, was started that year and completed in 1956. This work included widening and reconstructing the route's bridge across Rock Creek. MD 586 was expanded to a divided highway from Turkey Branch to MD 97 between 1955 and 1957. The westernmost segment of the highway at the MD 28 intersection was expanded to a divided highway shortly after the completion of MD 28's modern bridge across the railroad in 1981. The pedestrian bridge that carries the Rock Creek Hiker-Biker Trail across MD 586 was constructed starting in 2008 and opened in 2011.

(formerly the Fine Arts Society of Indianapolis, Inc.), located in Indianapolis, Indiana, is an independent, non-profit producer of syndicated classical music radio programs and diversity-focused community engagement initiatives. Programs are made possible through the generous support of individuals, foundations, governmental entities, and private and public sector grants. History of Classical Music Indy Prior to 1961, there was little classical music on the radio in Central Indiana. In May of that year, a group of research chemists from Eli Lilly and Company pooled their resources, formed a corporation and on May 13 the \\"Lively Arts Station,\\" WAIV-FM went on the air. The station offered a variety of classical music, jazz, poetry, interviews, folk music, discussions of religion, and editorials. Its broadcasts emanated from a tower atop the Dearborn Hotel on East Michigan Street in Indianapolis. The station only became profitable in 1967 when the program format became exclusively classical. Programs were chosen by station staff and were presented in their entirety without interruption. This was the first completely classical music format on the radio in Indianapolis. Decisions between the owners of WAIV led to the sale of the station but Fine Arts Society co-founder Norbert Neuss was not about to give up. With the help of his friends he purchased WAIV's 2,500 classical record library, packed them up, and stored them in the Lilly Pavilion of the Indianapolis Museum of Art. His hope was to use them later. That moment came sooner than anyone could have hoped for. Neuss's friendship with Frank P. Thomas, founder and owner of the Burger Chef System of restaurants, turned out to be a decisive factor in fulfilling his dream of reviving classical music on the radio. In early 1968, Neuss, F. Bruce Peck, Frank P. Thomas and Willis K. Kunz formed the Fine Arts Society of Indianapolis, Inc. as a public charitable trust under the laws of the State of Indiana. The Society was granted 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service in January, 1969. Upon hearing that the Indianapolis Public Schools were constructing a new radio/television center, the Society approached school officials. After informal discussions between Neuss and the staff of the school's broadcast center, IPS's Board of School Commissioners and the Society arrived at an agreement whereby the Fine Arts Society would augment the instructional programs of the IPS's radio station, WIAN-FM, with a \\"Second Programme\\" of classical music during prime evening hours that went on the air in November, 1969. The partnership between the Fine Arts Society and the Indianapolis Public Schools' WIAN, represented a totally unprecedented and unique approach in financing a radio program without any tax subsidies. Through the Fine Arts Society's programming, WIAN was able to expand its broadcast hours by more than 100% at no cost to taxpayers. During these years, more than 20 different broadcast services provided the Second Programme with concert materials from the entire spectrum of worldwide musical activity. The Society was also especially proud to bring, to the Indianapolis radio audience, selected student and faculty concerts from the School of Music of Indiana University in Bloomington. Also during this time, the Society suffered a serious loss on November 5, 1973, when the Grant Fire destroyed the downtown Thomas Building, including the offices and classical and opera record collection of the Society. Thanks to the expansion of program time, WIAN was able to qualify for affiliation with National Public Radio and in the 1970s began receiving grants from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. WIAN had the financial resources to expand its own operation and programming originating from NPR, but this resulted in increased restrictions on broadcast time for the Society, and prompted the Society to seek another outlet for its programming. Fortunately, the University of Indianapolis was in the process of upgrading its campus radio station both in signal strength and into stereo broadcast mode. The happy affiliation of the Classical Music Indy and the University began on January 26, 1983, when the Society broadcast its First Program on WICR-FM, 88.7. The Metropolitan Opera selected The Fine Arts Society to join its national radio broadcasting network in 1993. 2001 saw the retirement of the volunteer President of the Society's Board, Norbert Neuss, after 32 years of service to the organization. He was appointed President Emeritus. In the summer of 2005 Society longtime Treasurer Bruce Peck died. A year later, President Emeritus Neuss died. The Fine Arts Society's 8,500 cd music library was dedicated the F. Bruce Peck Library and one of the production studios was dedicated the Norbert Neuss Production Studio in honor of their memory and contributions to the Society. In 2013, the Society conducted a community assessment that revealed an immediate need to create accessible programming reflective of the multiculturalism of the local community. In response, the Fine Arts Society changed its name to Classical Music Indy to better reflect the organization‚Äôs vision and mission, and developed a three-year strategic plan focused on creating musical programming to enhance community life through approachable, intergenerational cultural experiences. The Society assumed a new d/b/a on January 7, 2014 as \\"Classical Music Indy,\\" and the name was legally changed with the State of Indiana from \\"Fine Arts Society of Indianapolis, Inc.\\" to \\"Classical Music Indy, Inc.\\" on October 30, 2017. Today, Classical Music Indy is the creator and syndicator of classical music radio programs. The organization now also manages an innovative community concert series, maintains collaborative off-air programs geared towards revitalizing under resourced communities, and is the advocate for and promoter of local music and music-makers. The broad mission of the organization is ‚Äúto inspire people with the power of classical music.‚Äù =The George Foster Peabody Award= The Society received the coveted George Foster Peabody Award in 1986. This honor was given to only 28 of over 800 entries and was only the fourth ever received by an Indiana broadcast entity in the 48-year history of the award, administered by the University of Georgia School of Journalism and Mass Communication. What impressed the judges most was the manner in which the Fine Arts Society was able to finance its operations exclusively from private sources. Each year the Society produces and provides funds for more than 5,400 hours of professionally produced classical music programming. This programming is broadcast on WICR-fm, the radio station of the University of Indianapolis. For the Society's outstanding contribution the Peabody Board recognizes the accomplishments of both the Society itself as well as the individual contribution made by Norbert Neuss, its founder and president. Classical Music Indy, Inc. is a not-for-profit public charitable trust, under Section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

It is a type of output-based aid, as opposed to financing programs targeted only at inputs. The program was introduced in 2001 and is managed by the National Water Agency ANA. Under it, the federal government pays utilities (mostly public state or municipal water and sanitation companies) for treating wastewater based on certified outputs. Up to half the investment costs for wastewater treatment plants are eligible to be reimbursed over three to seven years, provided that the quality of the wastewater discharged meets the norms. If the norms are not met in one trimester, a warning is issued. If they are not met in the following trimester, the payment is suspended. If the norms are still not met in the next trimester, the service provider is excluded from the program. This provides strong incentives to properly operate and maintain plants. In short, the program does not fund promises, but results. The program enhances the financial viability of utilities and thus increases their ability to access commercial credit, through development banks (such as the Caixa Economica Federal) as well as commercial banks. The operational risk is clearly assigned to the service provider, who is best able to manage that risk. In order to prevent over-investment, the treatment plants have to be included in basin plans adopted by water basin agencies as a necessary condition to be eligible for financing under the program. Between 2001 and 2007, PRODES leveraged investments of US$290 million with subsidies and subsidy commitments of US$94 million, financing 41 wastewater treatment plants in 32 cities serving 2 million people. The program had a portfolio of 52 other projects to be financed serving 5.7 million people. Geographically, the projects are concentrated in the southeast of Brazil, the country's most urbanized region with the most serious pollution problems.Presentation by ANA at the Water Tribune of the Expo 2008 in Zaragoza, July 2008 In terms of background, financing and cost recovery for urban sanitation is a challenge throughout the world. Many utilities do not levy separate tariffs for sanitation. Where such charges exist they are usually insufficient to finance operation and maintenance costs, not to speak of capital costs. This problem is particularly acute in countries that embark on ambitious investment programs to increase the coverage of wastewater treatment. The challenge is to devise programs to channel subsidies while promoting efficiency as well as operational and environmental sustainability. PRODES is an interesting case where a program has been introduced that fits these criteria.

It is mostly used to describe fish, but is also used when describing reptiles, including fossil turtles, placodonts and invertebrates, as well as \\"bone- crushing\\" mammalian carnivores such as hyenas. Durophagy requires special adaptions, such as blunt, strong teeth and a heavy jaw. Bite force is necessary to overcome the physical constraints of consuming more durable prey and gain a competitive advantage over other organisms by gaining access to more diverse or exclusive food resources earlier in life. Those with greater bite forces require less time to consume certain prey items as a greater bite force can increase the net rate of energy intake when foraging and enhance fitness in durophagous species. In the order Carnivora there are two dietary categories of durophagy; bonecrackers and bamboo eaters. Bonecrackers are exemplified by hyenas and saber-toothed cats, while bamboo eaters are primarily the giant panda and the red panda. Both have developed similar cranial morphology. However, the mandible morphology reveals more about their dietary resources. Both have a raised and dome-like anterior cranium, enlarged areas for the attachment of masticatory muscles, enlarged premolars, and reinforced tooth enamel. Bamboo eaters tend to have larger mandibles, while bonecrackers have more sophisticated premolars. Fish Many fish exhibit durophagous behaviour including the Triggerfish, some Teleosts and some cichlids. =Triggerfish (Balistidae)= Triggerfish have jaws that contain a row of four teeth on either side, the upper jaw containing an additional set of six plate-like pharyngeal teeth. Triggerfish do not have jaw protrusion and there are enlarged jaw adductor muscles for extra power to crush the protective shells and spines of their prey. =Teleost (Teleostei)= These fishes crush hard prey and do so with the use of their pharyngeal jaws, with the aid of their protrusible mouth for enabling the grabbing of prey to draw it into their mouth. The pharyngeal jaws found in more derived teleosts are more powerful, with left and right ceratobranchials fusing to become one lower jaw and the pharyngeal branchial fusing to create a large upper jaw that articulates with the neurocranium. They have also developed a muscle, the hypertrophied pharyngeal, to crush prey with help from the molariform pharyngeal teeth. This allows for the consumption of hard-shelled prey. =Cichlids (Cichlidae)= Mollusk shells can be crushed to expose soft parts of the prey to digestive juices or the soft parts can be removed from the shell. Species that crush shells are defined by their large and greatly thickened pharyngeal bones. These bones have flat-crowned teeth and along with their dorsal fellows drawn by powerful muscles, create a crushing mill. The jaws are less derived as they are for just for picking up relatively large objects. The second method Cichlids use is to crush mollusk shells between powerful jaws armed with suitable teeth. Cichlids possess short, broad jaws armed with an outer row of relatively few, strong and conical teeth and several inner rows of finer, also conical teeth. Along with these features are the presence of foreshortening of the skull and development of particularly powerful mandibular adductor muscles. To feed with this type of structure the fish can protrude its mouth ventrally to permit muscles to be seized by the jaws and the mouth then is retracted rapidly so the hard-toothed jaws crush the mollusk shell with the resulting force. A series of biting movements completes the process and the shell fragments are spat out and the soft body is swallowed.  Chondrichthyans  Within the Chondrichthyans, horn sharks (Heterodontidae), some rays (Myliobatidae) and chimeras (Holocephali) exhibit durophagous behaviour. They have adaptations to allow for this including stout flattened teeth, hypertrophied jaw adductor muscles and robust jaws to feed on hard prey such as crustaceans and molluscs. Sharks that crush prey have teeth with small, low rounded cusps that are numerous per row, or are molariform. The molariform teeth are smoothly rounded, lack cusps, and there are numerous teeth per row. = Horn sharks (Heterodontiformes) = Horn sharks have molariform teeth. The anterior teeth are pointed and are used for grasping while the posterior teeth are molariform and are used for crushing. Horn sharks feed primarily on limpets, bivalve molluscs and blue crabs. = Bonnethead shark (Sphyrna tiburo) = The bonnethead shark Sphyrna tiburo uses ram feeding to capture crab, shrimp and fish which are placed between the molariform teeth where they are crushed. This species also uses suction to transport prey to the esophagus for swallowing. By combining durophagous characteristics with altered kinematic and motor patterns, bonnethead sharks can prey on hard shelled animals. This characteristic distinguishes prey crushing from simply biting, which is a behaviour exhibited by elasmobranchs. While bonnethead sharks feed almost exclusively on crabs, they have the same tooth structure as the Horn sharks (Heterodontiformes). = Chimeras (Holocephali) = Chimeras (Holocephali) have pavement teeth that are flat, hexagonal in shape and interconnect to form an even dental plate. There is the presence of calcified strengthened cartilaginous jaws, calcified struts within the jaws and a lever ‚Äònutcracker‚Äô system that amplifies the force of the jaw adductor muscles. The fusion of the palatoquadrate and mandibular symphysis, a restricted gape and asynchronous activation of the jaw adductors are key elements in the ‚Äònutcracker‚Äô model of jaw-crushing ability. Chimeras use their pavement teeth for grinding molluscs, gastropods and crabs. = Myliobatidae = Myliobatidae are free-swimming rays whose pectoral fins make up broad, powerful \\"wings\\" which include the eagle and cow-nose rays. They feed on molluscs and have dentitions adapted to crushing. Dentitions of durophagous myliobatids show several specializations in the jaws and teeth related to their diet. The cartilaginous jaws are strengthened by calcified struts (trabeculae), and the palatoquadrate and mandibular symphysis are fused. Strong ligaments connecting the upper and lower jaws restrict the jaw gape. The strong adductor muscles can be asynchronously activated.  Eagle (Aetobatus narinari) and cow-nose (Rhinoptera javanica) rays  In these groups, teeth are hexagonal and are arranged in anteroposterior files packed closely together in an alternating array to form an almost gap-free pavement, similar to the organization found in Chimeras. The teeth are covered with a layer of enameloid. The tooth pavement is stabilized by vertical surfaces that bear ridges and grooves which are interconnected with those on neighboring teeth. These rays also use their pavement teeth for grinding molluscs, gastropods and crabs. Cow nose rays are specialized suction feeders, which open and close their jaws to generate water movements that are used to excavate buried prey. Food capture is achieved by suction and the prey is then cleaned by actions similar to those used in excavation.  Myliobatis and Aetobatus  Anteroposterior ridges of the basal plate extend from the posterior margin of the tooth and these interdigitate with those of the succeeding tooth and also form a shelf on which the body of the neighboring tooth rests. The dentition of the bat ray (Myliobatis californica) is made up of a series of seven files of crushing teeth. The central hexagonal plate is very wide, taking up about half the width of the occlusal surface and it is flanked by three lateral files of smaller teeth on each side, the outermost being pentagonal. The crushing surface formed by the teeth of the upper jaw is more curved than that of the lower jaw.  Birds  Shorebirds commonly consume bivalves and snails which are low in chitin but the calcium carbonate shell makes up a large portion of their weight. Bivalves and snails are largely consumed whole by ducks and wading birds. The molluscivores that swallow snails or bivalves whole have large well-modularized gizzards for crushing the strong shells. The gizzard of red-necked stints and red knots is more than ten times larger than the proventriculus. The size of the gizzard is adaptable in these shore birds, becoming atrophied when soft food items like worms are consumed and increasing in size and muscularity following prolonged consumption of snails, cockles or mussels. The production of chitinase for the hydrolysis of chitin is important for birds that consume mollusks.  Marine mammals  = Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) = Sea otters preferentially forage on benthic invertebrates, particularly sea urchins, gastropod, bivalve mollusks, and crustaceans. Once prey is caught, the otters use their powerful jaws and sharp teeth to consume their meal quickly, even protective crustacean shells. They have canines that deliver a lethal bite, and molars that can crush bones and the shells of mollusks. Sea otter molars are broad, flat, multi cuspid teeth and the carnassial are also modified for crushing. Both the temporalis and masseter muscles are well developed, creating a strong bite force. The teeth are extremely broad and carnassial are highly molarized. Captured prey is manipulated with the forepaws or is held temporarily in loose skin pouches in the armpits. For larger, heavier-shelled prey, otters will sometimes exhibit tool-use behavior, breaking open sea urchins and mussels with a false stone used as an anvil. Sea otters can also bite sea urchins and mussels open using their strong jaws and teeth. Adults can crush most of their food items but youngsters have not yet developed powerful enough jaws. Therefore, young otters require the assistance of a tool or stone. Tools may also be used when the molluscs are too large to be crushed in the jaws.  Mammals  = Monkeys = All mangabeys appear to be durophagous and possess relatively thick molar enamel and expanded premolars, dental adaptations for processing hard foods. Their diet consists of Sacoglottis gabonensis seeds. These seeds can remain on the ground for months without rotting. With hard- object feeding, Mangabeys needed selection to favour thick molar enamel and flattened molars for crushing seeds. = Giant panda = The Giant Panda is mainly a herbivore despite its short, relatively unspecialized digestive tract that is characteristic of carnivores. Giant Pandas lack microbial digestion in their rumen or caecum that is typical of most herbivores for breaking down cellulose and lignin in plant cell walls. Therefore, Giant Pandas need to get their nutrients from the cell contents and fraction of hemicellulose they can break down. The panda subsists mainly on bamboo and does so with modifications of their jaws. Pandas show elaboration of the crushing features of the dentition. The molars are broad, flat, multi cuspid teeth and are the main grinding surface. Jaw action is not a simple crushing one but rather a definite sideways grinding. Panda jaws have a large zygomatico-mandibularis muscle, which is responsible for the sideways movement of the jaw. The glenoid is very deep, preventing back and forth movement of the jaw. Bamboo represents a predictable food source which is seasonally abundant. Pandas are able to subsist on it despite its low nutritive content. Pandas do this by moving large quantities through the digestive tract in a short period of time. They also reduce their energy expenditures by resting and only remaining active to feed, and they don't have a hibernation period, allowing them to have more foraging time. They chose security over uncertainty, indicated by their bamboo eating adaptations. = Hyaenids = Bone-crushing eating habits appear to be associated with stronger teeth, as seen is in Hyaenids. This is because bone- crushing requires greater bite strength and increases the risk of canine breakage. In Hyaenids, The carnassial are slightly less specialized as cutting blades than those of the Felidae. The bone-crushing adaptations relate mainly to the premolars. The anterior and posterior cusps are reduced and the central cusp enlarged and widened, so that the tooth is converted from a blade-like structure to a heavy conical hammer. Strong muscles are also required for bone crushing, and the temporalis attachment on the skull is enlarged by a strong sagittal crest. Heavy, hammer-like teeth and extremely strong jaws and jaw muscles make it possible for hyaenas to crack larger bone than other carnivores are capable of, and their highly efficient cutting carnassials can deal with tough hides and tendons. = Wolverine (Gulo gulo) = The wolverine has jaws and teeth that are extremely powerful and together with its scavenging habits, have earned the wolverine the name \\"hyena of the north\\". The wolverine is an effective scavenger, capable of cracking heavy bones and shows the same adaptations in the jaw as the hyenas do. The sagittal crest projects well above the area of attachment of the neck muscles, and in a large animal it extends back far behind the level of the condyles to provide attachments for the relatively enormous temporalis muscles, creating a powerful bite force.

She was one of the first European women who alone circled the globe. Biography She was born in the Styrian town of Celje (now part of Slovenia) in what was then the Austro-Hungarian Empire as the daughter of Jakob Karlin, a major in the Austro-Hungarian Army, and Vilibalda Miheljak, a teacher. Her father died when she was eight years old. Alma grew in a predominately German-speaking milieu, and regarded herself chiefly as Austrian rather than ethnic German or Slovene. After completing her secondary education in Graz, she traveled to London, where she studied languages. She learned English, French, Latin, Italian, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Russian, and Spanish. In the later years, she also studied Persian, Chinese, and Japanese. She also spent six months in Paris, where she attended various languages courses at the Sorbonne. It was at this time when she started work on her (unpublished) dictionary of ten languages, including Slovene. At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Karlin had to move to Sweden and Norway, since she was considered a persona non grata in the United Kingdom for being an Austrian-Hungarian citizen. It was in Scandinavia that she met the Swedish writer Selma Lagerl√∂f, who was so impressed by Karlin and her writing that she proposed her for a Nobel Prize. In 1919, she returned home, to Celje, then already part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Almost immediately thereafter, however, she started raising money for another journey. To this purpose, she opened a language school in Celje, where she taught up to ten hours a day, while her spare time was spent in painting and writing. On 24 November 1919, she took off again, this time on a nine-year- long journey around the world. She visited South and North America, the Pacific Islands, Australia, and various Asian countries. The last leg of her journey around the world was India. While she is often regarded as the first European women who travelled solo around-the-globe, she was the second woman to do so, preceeded by Ida Pfeiffer. In January 1928, at the request of her dying mother, Alma Karlin returned home, herself exhausted by physical illness and deep depression. She never traveled again. She devoted most of her time to writing. Around 1934, she started developing a keen interest in the study of theosophy. In the later years, especially during World War II, she became close to Roman Catholicism. Karlin had chronicled her journey in hundreds of reports published in various magazines and newspapers, including the gazette of the Germans in Celje, the Cillier Zeitung, and the German newspapers Neue Illustrierte Zeitung and Der Deutschen Bergknappe. After her return home, she wrote numerous works of fiction and non-fiction. She wrote in German until the rise of the Nazi German regime, when she abandoned German as an act of protest. In Germany, her books were burned by the regime. She also wrote in English for the English-speaking areas. In 1937‚Äì38, the Franco-German journalist and anti-Nazi writer Hans Joachim Bonsack found refuge in her home. Alma Karlin in the 1920s Soon after the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941 and the German occupation of Lower Styria, she was arrested and sent to Maribor where she waited for the extradition in Serbia, along with thousands of Slovenes. She was released thanks to the vigorous intervention of her lifetime friend Thea Gamelin. She could return to Celje, where she lived in house arrest. In spring 1944, she decided to escape to the southern Slovenian region of White Carniola, which was controlled by the Slovene partisan resistance. Even though she was severely ill, the Communist-led Partisans did not allow her to fly to the Allied-occupied town of Bari in Southern Italy. Instead, she was transported to Dalmatia where she stayed until the end of the war, when she moved back to Celje. She died of breast cancer and tuberculosis on 14 January 1950, in the village of Peƒçovnik near Celje and is buried alongside Thea Schreiber Gammelin (1906-1988) in the Svetina churchyard. Almost inevitably, Karlin also became a collector and ethnologist. Most of the objects she acquired on her journeys she sent home, where she later set up a small private museum. Some of the exhibits are now housed in the Celje Regional Museum.

A stylistic homage to the highly controversial cult horror film Cannibal Holocaust, the film follows a group of ambitious reporters who run afoul of a bloodthirsty native tribe. Plot The plot of Welcome to the Jungle concerns two young couples who go to Southwest New Guinea from Fiji in order to find Michael Rockefeller, the son of New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller who disappeared back in 1961, and sell an interview with him to the tabloids for $1,000,000. After a close encounter with armed criminals and psychopathic border guards, and after finding evidence that suggests that Michael Rockefeller may still be alive, the group finally makes it to the jungle where Rockefeller was last seen. The group ventures deep into the jungle where they find two Christian missionaries and a middle-aged Australian man who warns the group not to disturb the tribes in the area or else they will be killed. However tensions rise between the two couples which ultimately attracts the attention of local bloodthirsty cannibalistic tribes who then stalk one of the young couples while they are on a makeshift boat in the river and then attack them when they make their way to shore. Meanwhile, the next morning the other couple realizes that most of their essential belongings are missing, and they fear that the other couple took their items and went on ahead to find and interview Rockefeller without them. They then decide to go find their friends but end up finding blood and bits of their clothing on the shore where they were kidnapped. Fearing for their welfare the two go deep into the jungle and later that day find the body of the woman of the other couple. Later that night they find half-eaten bodies of the Christian missionaries whom they met earlier and then find their male friend whose legs and arms have been eaten off; they decide to kill him and escape. After escaping from the cannibals, the young couple come across a seemingly friendlier non-cannibalistic tribe who invites them to their village and provides them with food to eat. The couple then talks about what they are going to do with their lives after they escape, but their conversation is cut short when the tribe who invited them knock the young couple unconscious and kill them while their portable camera carries on filming. Seconds later, an old man is seen walking away from the tribe. There is no information of who this old man could be, but there is a possibility that it could be Michael Rockefeller, who has been kept alive by the tribe since he was captured by them in 1961.

Rumors from Montalcino: vino pugliese spacciato per Brunello? Sucking, James, Wine Spectator (March 21, 2008). Smoke and Fire in Montalcino The name \\"Brunellopoli\\" bears reference to Tangentopoli, or \\"Bribesville\\", the Italian political scandal of the 1990s, while some English language reporters have applied the name \\"Brunellogate\\". Events On March 21, 2008, Ziliani and Suckling reported that an investigation had begun into allegations that some Brunello producers had secretly and illegally added other types of grapes into what are by law wines made only from Sangiovese, allegedly to inflate production and increase profit on this typically expensive product. The story received wider attention on April 4, 2008 when the Italian newsweekly L'espresso reported that 20 firms were suspected of commercial fraud after investigators alleged that possibly millions of liters of Brunello di Montalcino had been cut with grapes of other varieties in violation of the purity requirements of Brunello's commercial certification. Vineyards were quarantined and hundreds of thousands of bottles were seized by investigating magistrates. In addition, prominent producers such as Argiano and Castello Banfi admitted that they were under investigation. While unlike earlier Italian scandals regarding tainted or fraudulent wine, there was no health risk feared,Pomeroy, Robin, Reuters (April 4, 2008). Italian wine under investigation for adulteration many observers suggested that great damage to the reputation of Brunello di Montalcino would result in lasting economic effects. The prosecutor handling the case, Nino Calabrese, stated that the relevant commercial fraud charges carry a maximum sentences of up to six years in prison. In addition, any winemaker found guilty of violating the purity rules set down by Brunello's controlling body, the Consorzio del Vino Brunello, would probably mean expulsion from that group. The Consorzio has around 250 members, all of whom are bound to follow specific standards for winemaking, most importantly that only Sangiovese grapes are used. Some have asserted that the alleged substitute grapes used to cut wine production by fraudulent winemakers were cheap grapes that probably came from vineyards in southern Italy. Some winemakers, such Argiano, have moved to decertify all the bottles that have thus far been impounded by the prosecutor's office in an effort to allow them to bring them to market, albeit under a different name and at a significantly lower price, rather than wait an indefinite length of time for a court resolution. \\"Our decision isn't because we feel guilty,\\" said a representative of Argiano. \\"We can't wait passively for months. We need to be on the market.\\" In May, 2008, the U.S. government announced its intent to block imports of Brunello that do not come with laboratory proof that they are in fact 100% Sangiovese. A spokesman for the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau stated that the United States took this step only after earlier requests for information from the Italian government met with an inadequate response. Response from critics Sangiovese grapes growing in Montalcino. The scandal was hardly a surprise to some experts, as wine critic and author Kerin O'Keefe had been questioning Brunellos which were suspiciously dark and without the typical aromas of pure Sangiovese wines for years. O'Keefe wrote in 2003 that many of 1997 Brunellos she had tasted: \\"were so jammy it was hard to believe they were Brunello\\", in 2006 that: \\"illicit blending with other grapes, to make luminous ruby-garnet color unnaturally darker, is staunchly denied on all official fronts, and in 2007 that: \\"Doubts can only remain in the face of some of the darker, impenetrable Brunellos sometimes seen\\". It has also been asserted that the addition of other grapes may have been for the purpose of broadening the market appeal of Brunello, which has been described as possessing idiosyncratic, rarefied characteristics that sometimes result in a \\"hard to drink\\" wine, though Brunellos generally are much praised. (A Biondi Santi 1955 Brunello was the only wine from Italy selected as \\"best of the century\\" by a panel of experts in 1999). Some experts, such as wine critics Ziliani and Eric Asimov, have expressed skepticism about the level of surprise and shock thus far expressed by industry members, asserting that rumors have been around for years regarding illegal varietals used by some producers in Montalcino. Eric Asimov wrote in 2006 that traditionally minded wineries \\"insist that some producers are already adding wine made from grapes other than Sangiovese to darken the color and to make the wine easier to drink at an early age\\". Aftermath In October 2008, the Consorzio of Brunello di Montalcino moved to sue the newspapers L'espresso and La Repubblica for defamation in their reports of April 4, claiming that the articles had insinuated that Brunello is a health risk to consumers. Later that month, Brunello producers decided by vote to let the rules remain that Brunello di Montalcino be 100% Sangiovese, with only 4% of the producers voting to change the production code.

The 90 FS is one of the oldest units in the United States Air Force, first being organized as the 90th Aero Squadron on 20 August 1917 at Kelly Field, Texas. The squadron deployed to France and fought on the Western Front during World War I as a Corps observation squadron.Gorrell During World War II, the unit earned the Distinguished Unit Citation and the Presidential Unit Citation for its services in the Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO) as part of Fifth Air Force. During the Cold War the squadron fought in the Korean War and Vietnam War.Maurer, Combat Squadrons Mission The 90th Fighter Squadron trains in the fighter missions of offensive counter-air (OCA), defensive counter-air (DCA) and suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD), as well as strategic attack and interdiction. History =World War I= : see 90th Aero Squadron for an expanded history of World War I operations The 90th Fighter Squadron origins begin with Special Order 104, Headquarters Kelly Field, San Antonio, Texas, on 25 September 1917. The men in it were largely from two detachments; one from Vancouver Barracks, Washington, which arrived at Kelly Field on 18 August; another from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, which arrived on 25 August. Both of these detachments had been held from the date of their arrival until 25 September under Recruit Camp Headquarters as a Provisional Squadron. The first few months of its existence were consumed by the necessary training to prepare the men for operations in France during World War I. On 30 September, the squadron left Kelly Field for the Aviation Concentration Center, Camp Mills, Garden City, New York, Long Island, where it arrived five days later. On the night of 5 October the Squadron detrained, and early next morning hiked out to Field No. 2 of the Aviation Concentration Center (Hazelhurst Field), where they were quartered with the Headquarters of the First Provisional Wing in Barracks No. 5. Here they stayed for several weeks performing guard duty and fatigue work, and carrying on the work of organization, equipment and preparation for overseas duty.Carver, et al. On 26 October, orders were received to pack up equipment and to prepare for immediate overseas departure. The following day the Squadron was moved to Pier 54, New York Harbor, and boarded the . The crossing of the Atlantic was uneventful, and on 10 November the Orduna moved into the dock at Liverpool, England. 90th Aero Squadron ‚Äì Salmson 2A2 On 12 November 1917, the men of the 90th arrived at Le Havre, France. Boarding the famous \\"Hommes 40, Chevaux 8\\" railroad box cars (maximum capacity of 40 men or eight horses,) they were shipped to Colombey-les-Belles Airdrome for what they thought would be immediate deployment to the front. But, to their great disappointment, they were given the assignment of road and barracks construction work, building the large 1st Air Depot and staging area which would eventually process and equip a large number of Americans that would arrive in France during 1918. After seven months at Colombey, the 90th Aero Squadron was designed as a Corps Observation squadron, being assigned to the III Corps Observation Group on 11 June 1918. Two days later it reached what was called the \\"Zone of Advance\\" (combat area) at Ourches Aerodrome. The squadron's first aircraft were the Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter ground attack aircraft.Bruce, p. 590. At Ourches, the 90th and other squadrons were engaged in combat operations, both in aerial combat and aerial reconnaissance photography. It took part in operations in the Toul Sector, the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and the first and second Meuse-Argonne Offensives. Later, the squadron upgraded to Salmson 2-A2s SPAD Xis, and Breguet BR-14 observation aircraft. Due to ever-present low clouds and rain, the flyers were forced to drop dangerously close to the ground to carry out their missions, usually in the worst conditions. 90th Aero Squadron \\"Lucky 7 dice emblem\\" The 90th Aero Squadron carried out many reconnaissances, engaged in 23 combats and relieved official confirmation for 7 aerial victories. The group's lucky \\"Seven Up\\" emblem of red dice with white dots reading \\"7\\" no matter which way it was tallied, proved prophetic, for they suffered 3 casualties, consisting of 2 killed and 1 wounded. In September 1918, it participated in the final allied offensives. The 90th earned a positive reputation for its ground attack missions during its continuous participation in the air offensive over Saint-Mihiel. Its first commander, First Lieutenant William G. Schauffler, designed the 90th's Pair o' Dice emblem displaying natural sevens during this campaign. Following the Armistice with Germany on 11 November 1918, little flying was done, most of the pilots and observers being absent on leave or returning to the States. On 15 January 1919 the squadron's planes were turned in to the 1st Air Depot, Colombey-les-Belles Airdrome, and there, practically all of the pilots and observers were detached from the Squadron. 90th Aero Squadron ‚Äì 11:00am 11 November 1918 Bethelainville Aerodrome, France. At Colombey, very comfortable quarters were assigned and the Squadron settled down to await orders to the coast. The Squadron left Colombey les Belles 25 January 1919, en route for the Port of Embarkation. It stopped at the pretty little village of St. Denis de Piles, near Libourne, Gironde, and the officers and enlisted personnel occupied excellent billets. On 3 February after five days spent at St. Denis, the Squadron was ordered to Libourne, the next step on the way home. There the men occupied the old stone French barracks, while the officers were billeted at private houses throughout the town. The Squadron remained at Libourne until 10 April, when the long-awaited order to proceed to the Embarkation Camp. After two or three disappointments the men were ordered on board the . Officers were detached, and sailed the same day, 20 April, Easter Sunday, on board the . The voyage was very uneventful Land was finally sighted at 5 a.m. 3 May, and the squadron docked in Hoboken, New Jersey at 10 a.m., after a voyage of thirteen days. On 4 May at 8 a.m., the Squadron marched over to Field No. 2, Garden City (Mitchell Field), and the work of demobilizing the squadron was begun. After the war, 90th alumni commissioned Tiffany's of New York to design a silver pin with the squadron logo. =Inter-War Period= De Havilland DH-4 bomber with members of the 90th Squadron (Surveillance) at Sanderson Field, Texas, ca 1920. : see also: United States Army Border Air Patrol After returning from France, most of the squadron demobilized at Mitchell Field and returned to civilian life. A small cadre of the unit remained in the Air Service, and were sent back to Kelly Field, Texas. At Kelly, the 90th, along with the 8th, 12th and 13th Aero Squadrons were formed into the Army Surveillance Group on 1 July 1919. The group was redesignated the 3d Attack Group on 2 July 1921. The mission of the Army Surveillance Group was to carry out observation overflights along the Mexican Border. During this period, Mexico was enduring a period of revolution and unrest, which led to border violations and the deaths of American citizens. From Kelly Field, the squadron was divided into two flights, Flight A operated from Eagle Pass Field, while Flight B operated from Kelly Field. Both flights were equipped with American- built deHavilland DH-4 aircraft, which were designed as bombers during the war. 90th Attack Squadron ‚Äì Curtiss A-12 Shrike, 1933 During the late summer of 1919, the 464th Aero Construction Squadron had been sent to establish an Army airfield at Sanderson, Texas. By November, enough construction had been completed at Sanderson Field that the squadron moved from Kelly to operate from the new airfield, while the detachment at Eagle Pass Field continued operations. The detachment moved from Eagle Pass to Del Rio Field, Texas, on 12 Jun 1920. As the unrest in Mexico died down by the middle of 1921, the 90th reunited and moved back to Kelly Field in July. At Kelly Field, Brigadier General William 'Billy' Mitchell, a senior staff officer in the Army Air Service, decided to use this low-level flying experience and the World War I experience of the 3d Group's pilots to create a group devoted to low-level mission of supporting ground troops and attacking ground targets.

The 90th Squadron contributed to the pioneering of new tactics for attack aircraft, delivered US mail in 1934, participated in aerial mapping missions during the 1930s, and attracted significant talent among early military airmen. One example of these early airmen was General James H. Doolittle. On 2 September 1922, General Doolittle, then a first lieutenant, became the first pilot to travel coast-to-coast in under 24 hours. Although he could not remember if he was assigned to the 90th during the flight, the Air Force Historical Research Agency confirmed he was a member of the 90th at the time, and his DH-4 aircraft displayed the 90th's pair-o-dice emblem. Early commanders of the 90th also included Lieutenants Hoyt Vandenberg and Nathan Twining, both of whom later became Air Force Chiefs of Staff.

Their main mission involved highly-dangerous skip bombings. In an effort to improve the effectiveness and protection of the 3d Bombardment Group's pilots, Major Paul 'Pappy' Gunn, 3d Bombardment Group engineering officer, devised a modification of the B-25C. The modification replaced the forward bombardier with four forwards firing .50 caliber machine guns, supplemented with two twin .50 caliber gun packages side mounted on the fuselage. The lower turret was discarded. The A-20s received similar modifications. The modified aircraft were first employed by the 90th and proved exceptionally effective, receiving the nickname 'commerce destroyers.' During the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, every aircraft in the 90th scored a hit on the Japanese convoy of 18 ships. It was the first sea-level attack by B-25 strafers in World War II and demonstrated that this tactic was extremely effective. The squadron also participated in the raids on Wewak, New Guinea, which were preemptive strikes that virtually ended the threat of enemy offensive air capabilities. =Cold War= 3d Bomb Wing B-26B-50-DL Invaders during the Korean War. Serial 44-34306 identifiable. In 1945, after World War II, the 90th Squadron was moved to Japan. The 90th began flying the Douglas A-26 Invader as the 3d Bombardment Group became an all A-26 outfit. In September 1946, the 90th moved with the 3d Bombardment Group to Yokota Air Base, Japan, and began training to become combat-ready with the A-26, which was redesignated the B-26 Invader. With the creation of the U.S. Air Force in late 1947, the force began an internal reorganization. This led to the activation of the 3d Bombardment Wing in August 1948, to which the 3d Bombardment Group was assigned. The 90th Squadron was inactivated from 1 October 1949 until 25 June 1951. At that point, the squadron was redesignated the 90th Bombardment Squadron Light, Night Intruder. In July, as part of the 3d Bombardment Group, the 90th participated in the Korean War. The B-26 Invaders, which the 90th flew, had as many as 12 forward-firing .50 caliber machine guns. The 90th's specialty during the Korean War was destroying locomotives and marshalling yards. Martin B-57B-MA Serial 53-3896 of the 3d Bomb Wing. After the war, the 90th moved with the 3d Bombardment Group to Johnson Air Base, Japan, on 1 October 1954. In January 1956, the unit transitioned to the B-57C Night Intruder. In October 1957, the 3d Bombardment Group inactivated and its heritage transferred to the 3d Bombardment Wing, as did the 90th Bombardment Squadron. In 1960, the wing and squadron transferred to Yokota Air Base, where it trained in bombardment, reconnaissance, and air refueling. It also served nuclear alert during this period as well. In the mid-1960s, however, the squadron underwent significant changes. In 1964, the 3d Bombardment Wing converted to a tactical fighter wing, as did the 90th, which became the 90th Tactical Fighter Squadron on 8 June 1964. The wing and the 90th moved to England Air Force Base, Louisiana, as part of an overall reorganization to reduce the number of wings located in Japan. While at England, the 90th gained the North American F-100 Super Sabre. At the beginning of the Vietnam War, the 3d Bombardment Wing began deploying units to Vietnam on a rotational basis, while the remainder continued training in their ground support role. In November 1965, the wing moved to Bien Hoa Air Base, South Vietnam, during the buildup of forces. The 90th flew close air support missions from Bien Hoa through tens of thousands of sorties. In 1969, the 90th Tactical Fighter Squadron reverted to its pre-World War II designation of 90th Attack Squadron. On 31 October 1970, the 3d Tactical Fighter Wing ended its duties in Vietnam and remained active in 'paper' status until it moved to Kunsan Air Base, South Korea, in March 1971. The 90th Attack Squadron was reassigned to the 14th Special Operations Wing on 31 October 1970 and was redesignated the 90th Special Operations Squadron and remained in Vietnam at Nha Trang Air Base. 90th TFS North American F-100D-90-NA Super Sabre 56-3304 Bien Hoa Air Base, South Vietnam, 1967 From late 1970 until 1974, the 90th underwent several command reassignments. It remained with the 14th Special Operations Wing until 1 September 1971, when it moved to the 483d Tactical Fighter Wing and remained at Nha Trang Air Base. On 15 April 1972, the 90th moved again, this time to the 18th Tactical Fighter Wing at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, Japan. This assignment lasted only a few months, as the unit was assigned to the 405th Fighter Wing in December 1972 and moved to Clark Air Base, Philippines. The squadron was redesignated the 90th Tactical Fighter Squadron on 8 July 1973, and began to fly McDonnell F-4 Phantom IIs. In September of the following year, the 90th returned once again to the 3d Tactical Fighter Wing, when it relocated to Clark Air Base after the 405th Fighter Wing was inactivated. In 1975, the 90th converted to the F-4E and participated in combat training and providing air defense for the Philippines. thumbleftMcDonnell Douglas F-4G-42-MC Phantom Serial 69-0275 of the 90th TFS/3d TFW Clark AFB, Philippines, 1979. In July 1977, the 90th once again upgraded its aircraft, this time to the F-4G, which performed a ground radar suppression and destruction mission. The squadron had both F-4G and F-4E aircraft assigned, operating in \\"hunter-killer\\" roles. Each F-4G was paired with an F-4E during each mission, and the G models would point out threat radar sites to the E models for attack, as well as attacking using their own armaments. This multiplied the force being applied without having to purchase more of the expensive G models. During the late 1970s and 1980s, the squadron provided training and support to other units throughout the Pacific, as well as ensuring the readiness of its own pilots and aircraft. The unit participated in numerous Cope Thunder exercises hosted at Clark AB, as well as Pitch Black in Darwin, Australia, and other exercises in South Korea. By 1990, however, the Philippines had expressed a desire for the withdrawal of American military forces in the islands. In May 1991, the 90th Tactical Fighter Squadron was reassigned to the 21st Tactical Fighter Wing located at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska. In September 1991, the 90th was redesignated the 90th Fighter Squadron and became part of the 21st Operations Group. This association did not last long, however. =Post-Cold War= \\"Philippine Expeditionary Force\\" back home at Clark AB, RP before Mount Pinatubo eruption. In June 1991, Mount Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines and the Air Force quickly decided to evacuate its personnel and equipment from Clark AB. The 3d Tactical Fighter Wing remained in the Philippines during Desert Shield and Desert Storm due to instability in the Philippines. However, it was not going to remain in the islands for very long. It became a 'paper' unit briefly while the Chief of Staff, General Merrill McPeak, decided where to send the wing. He selected Elmendorf. The 21st Tactical Fighter Wing was inactivated and the 3d Wing replaced it as the lead wing at Elmendorf on 19 December 1991. With the establishment of the 3d Wing on Elmendorf, the 90th Fighter Squadron was once again reunited with its old wing. While these changes occurred with the 3d Wing, the 90th Fighter Squadron deployed six F-4G crews to join other Wild Weasel squadrons and coalition forces in Sheikh Isa, Bahrain for the Gulf War.Schreiner & Eisel, The six crews were attached to the 81st Tactical Fighter Squadron and were known as the Philippine Expeditionary Force (PEF). During combat operations, PEF crews destroyed multiple Iraqi SAM sites. This was the last combat deployment for the 90th while operating F-4Gs. Upon relocating to Elmendorf, the unit gained a new aircraft, the McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle. This two-seat dual role updated version of the F-15C Eagle had more survivability enhancements than any other fighter aircraft at the time. It carried a wide array of armament as it performed both air-to-air and air-to-surface attack missions. A 90th FS F-15E Strike Eagle flies over glacial fields during a training mission. Since arriving in Alaska, the 90th Fighter Squadron participated in numerous training exercises in the lower 48 states and other areas of the world. These training exercises included Polar Thrust, Cope Thunder, Tandem Thrust, Cope Thaw, and Red Flag in locations such as Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, Osan Air Base, Korea, Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, Naval Air Station Fallon, Nevada, and Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. The squadron also developed a reputation for safety in its training. On 20 February 1996, the squadron received the Alaska Governor's Safety Award conferred through the Alaska Department of Labor. This was the first time a military organization won the state award since its inception in 1980. In addition to exercises, the 90th Fighter Squadron also undertook real-world deployments during the 1990s and early 2000s (decade). From October 1995 until January 1996, the squadron deployed 8 F-15Es and 193 personnel to Aviano Air Base, Italy in support of Operation Deny Flight and Operation Joint Endeavor. In February 1998, the squadron deployed 18 F-15Es and over 200 personnel to Kwangju Air Base and Taegu Air Base, both in Korea. While there, the unit flew 1200 joint combat training sorties. Personnel and aircraft redeployed in June 1998. In 2001 the 90th began a series of deployments which took members of the squadron to the Middle East and Southwest Asia. In March of that year, the 90th participated in a 90-day deployment in support of Operation Northern Watch, patrolling the northern No-fly zone in Iraq. The squadron sent 154 personnel and 10 F-15Es to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey and returned to Elmendorf on 9 June 2001. Later that year, in October, 18 F-15Es were deployed to Kwangju Air Base, Korea, in support of Afghanistan operations. While deployed pilots flew practice strike missions and provided long-range interdiction strike capability in the region during the absence of the , they also flew missions over South Korea and repaired base infrastructure while there. The squadron redeployed from 20 to 23 December. The first of 40 F-22A Raptors at Elmendorf. The aircraft is flown and maintained by the active-duty Air Force's 90th Fighter Squadron and Air Force Reserve 302d Fighter Squadron. The 90th Fighter Squadron participated in an historic event on 4 September 2002. Two Royal Australian Air Force exchange officers, Flight Lieutenant Paul Simmons and Flight Lieutenant Tony Southwood, paired up to fly one of the 90th's F-15Es. This was the first time Australian pilots flew an American aircraft in the Pacific Theatre. In 2003 the squadron undertook another deployment in the Pacific in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The 90th sent 18 F-15Es to bases in the Pacific, including Osan Air Base, Kunsan Air Base, (both in Korea), Kadena Air Base, Japan and Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. The deployment included 592 personnel from mid-February until mid-May. Kwangju AB, Korea, once again became home to members of the 90th Fighter Squadron in 2004. In August the squadron deployed 12 F-15Es in a rotation. The unit was temporarily designated the 90th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron and assigned to the 3d Air Expeditionary Group. While deployed the unit flew more than 1100 sorties over the Korean Peninsula and provided two important flights to distinguished visitors, Republic of Korea Air Force Brigadier General Ko and Republic of Korea General Kim, Commander Korean Ground Forces. In 2005, the squadron focused on training and preparation for their next real-world deployment. Amidst the training and exercises, however, the squadron was able to showcase their talent with participation in the Aero India Airshow and with a flyby at the United States Air Force Academy before the Air Force-Army football game. Additionally, the F-15Es completed an upgrade of their weapons systems. This upgrade allowed the aircraft to carry and use more advanced weaponry, including the Joint Direct Attack Munition and eventually the Small Diameter Bomb. As 2006 progressed, the 90th Fighter Squadron began to prepare for significant changes in its mission and weapons system. The F-15Es were scheduled to relocate to Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, through the BRAC decisions in 2005. Replacing those F-15Es, the 90th began receiving the advanced F-22 Raptor in August 2007, which greatly enhanced the 90th Fighter Squadron's ability to perform its duties.

Known for most of its length as Layhill Road, the highway runs from MD 97 in Glenmont to MD 108 in Olney. MD 182 connects the northeastern Montgomery County communities of Glenmont, Layhill, Norwood, Sandy Spring, and Olney. The highway was constructed in the early 1920s. MD 182 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from Glenmont to the site of its interchange with MD 200 in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Route description View north along MD 182 near Ednor Road in Sandy Spring MD 182 begins at an acute intersection with MD 97 (Georgia Avenue) in Glenmont. The highway heads north as Layhill Road, a six-lane divided highway that passes the Glenmont station at the eastern terminus of the Washington Metro's Red Line. MD 182 reduces to four lanes north of Glenallen Avenue. The highway crosses Bel Pre Creek and intersects Bel Pre Road and Bonifant Road at the hamlet of Layhill; Bonifant Road leads to the National Capital Trolley Museum. North of Layhill, MD 182 meets MD 200 (Intercounty Connector) at a diamond interchange and intersects the eastern terminus of a section of the ICC Trail before it reduces to a two-lane undivided road just south of its bridge across Buckhorn Branch of the Northwest Branch Anacostia River, which parallels the highway to the east. The highway temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway at its intersection with Norbeck Road, which heads west as MD 28. MD 182 continues to the hamlet of Norwood, where the highway intersects Norwood Road. The road continues straight as Ednor Road and MD 182 turns north onto Norwood Road. North of the Sandy Spring Friends School, Norwood Road veers north as a county highway toward Sandy Spring. MD 182 continues along Dr. Bird Road, which carries the state highway northwest to its northern terminus at MD 108 (Olney Sandy Spring Road) opposite the Olney Theatre Center for the Arts on the eastern edge of Olney. MD 182 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from its southern terminus at Glenmont to MD 28 near Norwood. History Layhill Road and Norwood Road were once part of the Clarksville Pike, which originally connected Ellicott City and Clarksville, Maryland. In 1889, it was extended to Ashton and Unity. The road was maintained by the Union Turnpike Company, which also operated the Brookeville Turnpike and a turnpike from Olney to Ashton. The road was included as part of the Maryland State Roads Commission's original state road system in 1909. However, by 1915, the highway was deemed not to form a necessary part of the main arterial system. MD 182 was paved as a macadam road between 1921 and 1923. The state highway designation was removed from Norwood Road and placed on Dr. Bird Road north of the Norwood-Dr. Bird intersection in 1977. MD 182 was expanded to a divided highway from MD 97 to just north of Bel Pre Road and Bonifant Road in 1989. The divided highway section was extended to just south of Buckhorn Branch in 1991. MD 182 was expanded to a divided highway at the MD 28 intersection in 2001 and 2002. The highway's interchange with MD 200 was under construction in 2010 and opened in 2011.

Biography A native of Robeson County, North Carolina, Galbreath got his start with local groups such as the Domino Five of Washington and Kelly's Jazz Hounds of Fayetteville. He then found work with groups in other regions such as the Florida Blossoms minstrel show and the Kingston Nighthawks, a territory band. He was with Smiling Billy Steward's Floridians when they played the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago. In the middle of the 1930s, Galbreath moved to Chicago, where he played with Fletcher Henderson, Jelly Roll Morton, Edgar Hayes, and Willie Bryant. Around 1937 Galbreath joined Lonnie Slappey's Swingers in Philadelphia, but was called back to New York by Lucky Millinder, with whom he played for some time. Following this he joined Louis Armstrong's Orchestra until its dissolution in 1943; he then played with Charlie Barnet for a few weeks before serving in the Army. After his discharge he worked in the second half of the decade with Luis Russell, Tab Smith, Billy Eckstine, and Sy Oliver, then returned to play with Millinder from 1948 to 1952. From 1952 Galbreath played in USO tours, first with Snub Mosley and then with various other ensembles over the course of the next decade.

A branch line was built by an independent railway friendly to the Great Western Railway (GWR) from Savernake to Marlborough in 1864. A north-south railway, later to be part of a long distance trunk route, opened from Swindon to its own station at Marlborough in 1881, extending south to Andover in 1881, running over the branch line at first. Later the company built its own duplicate line to by- pass the GWR line. The two routes came under the same management at the \\"Grouping\\" of the railways in 1923 and some rationalisation took place. Passenger services to Marlborough were withdrawn in 1961 and goods services in 1964. The Great Western Railway Branch } =Marlborough Railway= On 11 November 1862, the Berks and Hants Extension Railway (B&HER;) opened a broad gauge railway line from Hungerford, itself originally the terminus of a branch line from Reading, to Devizes.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway, vol. 1 part II, published by the Great Western Railway Company, London, 1927 At Devizes the new line linked up with the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway branch line from Trowbridge which had opened in 1857. The line was worked by the larger Great Western Railway (GWR).E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway, vol. 1 part I, published by the Great Western Railway Company, London, 1927 Although Marlborough was an important market town, the new B&HER; main line passed some distance to the south, near the village of Burbage. Local businessmen promoted an independent branch line, the Marlborough Railway, to connect their town to the Savernake station of the B&HER.; It opened on 15 April 1864; it was 5 miles 49 chains (9.0 km) in length, and built using the broad gauge. There were no intermediate stations, and trains departed from a new platform at Savernake. This line too was worked by the GWR, and the B&HER; and the Marlborough Railway were absorbed by the Great Western Railway in 1886; the Marlborough Railway was purchased for ¬£9,250 in cash. Both lines were converted to standard gauge in 1874.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway, volume II, published by the Great Western Railway Company, London, 1931 =Marlborough GWR station= The GWR station in Marlborough was to the south- east of the town centre, on the west side of Salisbury Road; it had a substantial L-shaped red brick building with waiting rooms for both first- class and ordinary passengers. It had a single platform, and goods facilities were provided at the northern end. There was also a separate goods yard to the south of the station and an engine shed to the north east near the buffer stops. Poster for road motor service to Calne 1904Marlborough GWR station became the focus for road traffic in the area, with horse buses at first along the Bath road; motor buses were introduced in 1904. Many of the bus services were operated by the GWR. The Midland and South Western Junction Railway =The Swindon, Marlborough and Andover Railway= Original plans for railways in the Marlborough area had focused on a scheme for a north-south line to link Swindon with Andover, passing through Marlborough. Though the GWR branch line got to Marlborough first, the north-south plans were revived with an Act in 1873, and the Swindon, Marlborough and Andover Railway was built in two halves. The northern section, from Swindon Town south to Marlborough, was opened in July 1881; the southern section, from Andover Junction north to Grafton and Burbage, opened the following year, 1882. The new Marlborough station opened as a terminus just to the east of the existing GWR station. It had a station building on the up platform (towards Swindon) with a huge canopy. There was a goods yard behind the up platform to the north west of the passenger station with a large goods shed. =Links to the GWR= Having built its lines from the north and the south, the financially strapped SM&AR; then found that it could not join them, being unable to afford to persuade landowners to sell their property to build the missing link. Instead, it built a short link within Marlborough to the GWR branch line just south of Marlborough GWR station and another link from the GWR's Berks and Hants Extension Railway just east of Savernake station southwards to Grafton and Burbage station. From February 1883, SM&AR; through trains used the GWR Marlborough branch and a short section of the B&HER; main line, including Savernake station. A condition of the GWR lease was that passengers wanting to change at Savernake to other GWR services had to use the GWR trains from Marlborough. =The Swindon and Cheltenham Extension Railway= In 1884, the SM&AR; combined with the Swindon and Cheltenham Extension Railway, which ran northwards from Swindon Town, first to Cirencester and then, from 1891, into Cheltenham Lansdown. The combined line was called the Midland and South Western Junction Railway (M&SWJR;) and with its links northwards from Cheltenham to the Midlands and southwards from Andover over the Sprat and Winkle Line to the south coast ports it became a true through line. =The Marlborough and Grafton Railway= Marlborough and Savernake lines in 1922With the northern extension to Cheltenham complete, the M&SWJR; turned its attention in the early 1890s to resolving its problem at Marlborough, where it was paying ¬£1,000 a year to run over the GWR Marlborough branch tracks. It negotiated successfully with the Marquess of Ailesbury to run a new line from the M&SWJR; station in Marlborough, through a 640-yard tunnel and across Savernake Forest. The new section then crossed the GWR's Berks and Hants Extension line and joined the southern section of the original SM&AR; line just north of Grafton and Burbage station. The new double-track section was called the Marlborough and Grafton Railway and was given the parliamentary go- ahead in 1893. It opened for through traffic on 26 June 1898, at which point the link just outside Marlborough station to the GWR branch line was closed. The only intermediate station on the new section was at Savernake, about 200 yards from the GWR Savernake station but not connected to it. The Marlborough and Grafton Railway was formally taken over by the M&SWJR; in 1899 and for the next quarter century Marlborough had regular services on both lines. The April 1910 timetable, for example, shows each line offering about eight services a day, though the GWR did not run any trains on Sundays. Rationalisation after the Grouping =Station renaming= The Railways Act 1921 grouped most of the railways in mainland Great Britain into four large companies, and the Midland and South Western Junction Railway was incorporated into the Great Western Railway, its rival for the rail traffic at Marlborough. For a few years, the GWR did nothing to rationalise the anomaly of having two parallel lines running into the town, but it did rename the stations. Confusingly the former GWR stations were named Marlborough High Level and Savernake Low Level, while the former M&SWJR; stations were renamed as Marlborough Low Level and Savernake High Level. =1926 link= Then in 1926, the GWR reopened the 1883 link between the two lines just outside the two Marlborough stations, enabling trains from the main line junction at Savernake Low Level to pass through Marlborough on to the north. =1933 link= But the real changes came in 1933. The GWR built a second link between its original branch line and the M&SWJR; line much nearer Savernake and closed the original branch and station in Marlborough to passenger traffic. The goods yard at Marlborough GWR station was retained, but was accessed from the north through the Marlborough M&SWJR; station using the link that had been restored in 1926. All passenger services were rerouted to the M&SWJR; station at Marlborough. The GWR chose to operate the double track M&SWJR; line as two separate single track lines: the former up line (towards Swindon) was used for the branch services from Savernake Low Level while the through north-south services which passed through Savernake High Level all ran on the former down line. This odd arrangement persisted through into British Railways days. Decline and closure =World War II= The Midland and South Western Junction line was very heavily used for troop and other military movements across Salisbury Plain in the Second World War, but after the war both passenger and goods traffic declined sharply in competition with road transport. Marlborough, about midway between London and Bath/Bristol, had become a focus for long-distance east-west bus services and the railway found it difficult to compete. =Closure= The whole line closed for passenger services in 1961, and that included the remaining branch line service from Savernake Low Level. Before the closure, there had been one last twist in the intertwined history of the two lines and the various stations. In September 1958, a landslip blocked the main line close to Savernake High Level station. Through services were diverted back through Savernake Low Level, as they had been from 1883 to 1898, but this time using the later 1933 link between the lines, and Savernake High Level station closed. This arrangement, however, lasted only three years until passenger services were withdrawn. Goods traffic continued to Marlborough from Savernake for a further three years, with the GWR station's goods yard remaining open until May 1964 and the M&SWJR; station's goods facilities holding on until September 1964. There were occasional passenger services too in this period, associated with Marlborough College excursions. =The sites today= Today both Marlborough stations have disappeared beneath new developments in the town.

Admissions The school teaches pupils between the ages of 11 to 18. In September 2012, the school offered places in a newly established sixth form. It is sited on Gunnersbury Lane (A4000) just north of Acton Town Underground station. History =Grammar school= The school was originally known as Acton County Grammar School, which opened in 1906 for 200 boys. It was the first purpose-built county grammar school in Middlesex. In 1958, it began admitting girls, becoming fully co-educational in 1966. In 1965, the school's administration moved from Middlesex County Council to the London Borough of Ealing. When proposals for going comprehensive appeared in 1966, parents took the LEA to court and lost. =Comprehensive= The school became a comprehensive in 1967, when Ealing borough adopted the three tier system, and was known as Acton County Comprehensive and later, after 1972, became Reynolds High School, named after local politician Gerry Reynolds. The 18-year-old \\"graduation\\" year of 1976 produced 4 university students out of an intake of 180 in 1969. School colours were brown and cream, with a badge showing a ring of oak leaves around a portcullis with the school name superimposed. The school roll in 1979 amounted to 1040 pupils and until its final years, consisted of eight forms per year. In the 1970s, the neighbouring Ealing Mead County school off Popes Lane, opened in 1962, was found to have serious structural problems in its building. After only eight years of use, Ealing Mead had to be closed and demolished. As a result, the pupils of the school were distributed around the other local schools and Reynolds High School absorbed a significant proportion of them. Reynolds High School closed in July 1984 primarily due to falling school roll but re-opened in September the same year as Acton High School following a merger with the Faraday High School, formerly based at Bromyard Avenue. The old brick buildings, dating from 1939, were demolished in 2005, and a new school building built on the same site. The front of the main building =Ark= Since 2018 it has been part of the Ark network. Facilities =Reynolds Sports Centre= Reynolds Sports Centre is a sport and leisure centre building adjoined with Acton High School's main building. The sports and leisure centre is managed by the council's Active Ealing team. The facility is available for students and for public use after school hours. It includes a sports hall, fitness gym, dance studio and two multi use outdoor games areas. Each facility is available for hire.

Webb was born in 1825, in Washington. He was only 19 years old when he graduated from Columbia College (now George Washington University, and was admitted to the District of Columbia bar Three years later. Upon admission he entered practice, in which he remained until 1861. That year, the capital's Metropolitan Police Department was organized, and Webb was appointed its first superintendent by Mayor Richard Wallach. It was under Webb's administration that the police force conducted the investigation into the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865. That same year, Webb resigned from the Police Department and returned to his Washington law practice, where he commanded an extremely high reputation among his colleagues. The Washington Post said of Webb that \\"his digest of municipal laws, as affecting the national capital, is regarded as the standard authority.\\" In 1885, upon the vacancy of Joseph Rodman West from his seat on the D.C. Board of Commissioners, President Grover Cleveland surprised the city establishment by offering the appointment to the popular and respected Webb, who accepted and joined the commission for its sixth session in July, 1885. When board president James Barker Edmonds declined reappointment on April 1, 1886, Cleveland raised Webb to the position. Webb died at his home in Washington on March 13, 1896, at the age of 70. In 1901, The William Benning Webb School, named in his honor, opened at 15th and Rosedale, NE. It was an all-white school, but by 1947 it had become unused and at late that year became an annex to all-black Browne Junior High School.

Her feast day is May 24, and she is also venerated along with the rest of the 103 Korean martyrs on September 20. Anna was naturally slow, and she had great difficulty in learning about religion. She consoled herself by saying, \\"Since I cannot know my God as I should desire to do, I will at least endeavor to love Him with all my heart.\\" She married a Christian, and brought up her children in that religion. She felt particular devotion in meditating on the Passion of our Lord: the sight of His five wounds was sufficient to draw abundant tears from her eyes. When she heard persecution mentioned, her countenance, far from growing pale, became, on the contrary, more animated. She was arrested with her husband and eldest son. The latter had numerous friends at court, who did all in their power to make them apostates, and at length succeed as far as her husband and son were concerned: they were then set free. Anna, however, remained firm. The judge often tried to shake her determination by severity or by kindness, but his endeavors were vain. Her husband and son came to see her daily and entreated her to say but one word, and leave the prison. They presented to her the desolation of her family, her old mother at the point of death, her children crying out for her, but her resolution was unshaken. \\"What,\\" she said, \\"for a few days of life will you expose yourselves to everlasting death? Instead of soliciting me to transgress, you should exhort me to remain steadfast. Return, return rather to God, and envy me my happiness.\\" Anna remained in prison for three months, and died on 24 May 1839, at the age of fifty-seven.

Parker specialized in watercolour painting, and exhibited internationally. He was awarded numerous grants over his life, including two Canada Council Grants, and a British Council of the Arts Grant. He lectured all over the world, was published internationally, and collaborated closely with manifold scholars and thinkers, McLuhan among them.  Life and career  Harley Parker was born in Fort William, Ontario in 1915. He graduated from the Ontario College of Art (OCA) in Toronto, Ontario in 1939, and from there went on to work independently as an artist. Years later, he taught color, design, and watercolor. In 1946, he attended and completed further studies at Black Mountain College in Virginia, studying under Josef Albers. Between the years of 1947 and 1957, Parker taught colour theory and design, as well as watercolour techniques, at the Ontario College of Art (OCA) in Toronto, Ontario. In 1957, he assumed the position of Head of Design and Installations at the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) in Toronto, a post which he retained for a decade, until 1967. During a year-long sabbatical leave from his teaching position, he became an associate professor at Fordham University sharing the Albert Schweitzer chair of communications with Professor Marshall McLuhan. From 1967 until 1975, Parker became involved with McLuhan's Centre for Culture and Technology at the University of Toronto as a research associate. His work there revolved around investigating the relationships between the arts and sciences in the 20th century. It was during these years that he collaborated most closely with Marshall McLuhan, co- authoring two titles, Through the Vanishing Point: Space in Poetry and Painting and Counterblast. In 1973, Parker was selected to be the first Institute Professor of Communications at the Rochester Institute of Technology, in Rochester, New York. He returned to Canada the following year to pick up his work with McLuhan's Centre for Culture and Technology. Parker retired from his scholarly career in 1976, whereupon he moved to British Columbia to live and paint in the Kootenay Mountains. He participated in many solo and group exhibitions across Canada and the globe, both in solo and group shows, until his death in 1992.

Early years Willis became a sailor at 15, leaving his home in Hamburg, Germany, to sail around Cape Horn.Pearson, T.R. (2006). Seaworthy: Adrift with William Willis in the Golden Age of Rafting, Crown Publishers, New York. . A few days after New Years, 1938 (Page 5, \\"Damned and Damned Again\\") Willis rented a room in New York City from a French immigrant named Madame Carnot. Her son, Bernard Carnot, had been sent to Devil's Island in 1922 for a murder that he did not commit. Out of compassion and a sense of adventure, Willis set out to the penal colony to effect Bernard Carnot's escape, which he eventually accomplished. During his first solo expedition in 1954 from South America to American Samoa, he sailed 6,700 miles ‚Äì 2,200 miles farther than did Thor Heyerdahl on Kon-Tiki. His raft was named \\"Seven Little Sisters\\" and was crewed by himself, his parrot, and cat. Willis was age 61 at the time of this voyage. He selected the seven great balsa tree trunks which were used in the raft (hence the name Seven Little Sisters) himself at a balsa forest on a great inland estate. His (American) wife saw him off at the dockside in Callao, Peru. In an incident with the raft in the docks the day before sailing, Willis ruptured himself (suffered a hernia)https://www.amazon.com/Seaworthy-Adrift-William-Willis- Rafting/dp/030733595X, but nonetheless set sail as planned. In a second great voyage ten years later, at the age of 71, he sailed 10,000 miles from South America to Australia single-handing a 34-foot (10.4 m) raft named Age Unlimited. He left Callao on 5 July 1963, made a lengthy stop in Apia, and after a total of 204 days at sea, arrived near Tully, Queensland, completing his voyage on 9 September 1964.'Seaworthy' adrift with a free spirit Death and legacy At age 74, Willis made his third attempt at a solo crossing of the North Atlantic in a small sailboat. Willis left Montauk Point, Long Island on May 2, 1968, in his boat Little One. On September 24, 1968, the crew of the Soviet Latvian trawler Yantarny sighted his half-submerged boat nearly four hundred miles west of the Irish coast. No one was found on board. Willis' log was found on the boat, with its last entry dated July 21, 1968. Novelist T. R. Pearson wrote the book Seaworthy: Adrift with William Willis in the Golden Age of Rafting (2006), summarizing Willis's adventures. Willis's adventure on Devil's Island was featured in the Season 4 premiere of Drunk History on Comedy Central. In 2014 russian rock group Orgia Pravednikov (lit. 'Orgy of The Righteous') released a single Vdal po siney vode (lit. 'Far on blue water') about Willis's final adventure.

It is located in the Ounianga Kebir about 40 km west of Ounianga Sarir. These lakes are remnants of a much larger lake which occupied this basin during the African Humid period which lasted from approximately 15,000 to 5,500 years before present. There are currently 15 lakes in the basin with a total surface area of approximately square.ramsar.wetlands.org p.14 Climate change Lake Yoa recently became of interest in the study of global climate trends when a team headed by Stefan Kr√∂pelin, of the University of Cologne, recovered a core of sediment from the bottom of the lake. Because Lake Yoa has been in existence continuously since the Humid Period its waters have protected the sediments accumulated at the bottom from erosion and dispersal. After analysis of the pollen preserved in the core, Kr√∂pelin and his colleagues concluded that the shift from forest to desert in the area of Lake Yoa occurred gradually, with intervening periods of scrubland and grassland before the onset of full desert conditions. This conclusion contrasts with work done by Peter deMenocal of Columbia University and colleagues, who in 2000 drilled a core of ocean sediment off the western coast of Mauritania. Because of the dust levels in this core deMenocal and his co-authors concluded that desert conditions came on quickly, over a period of a few centuries. The discrepancies between these two accounts are not surprising given the differences in the data examined. The ocean core represents what is essentially a mass survey of the entire northern portion of the African land mass while the Lake Yoa data would survey more specifically conditions in the areas to the south and west of it, which supplied material to the prevailing trade winds of Holocene time before they crossed Lake Yoa. It is possible both that, northern Africa became quickly and generally drier, and that, in specific areas the process of desertification moved through a series of more gradual ecological transitions.

One of the Potawatomi chieftains wishing to remain neutral during Tecumseh's War, he and Gomo refused to ally with Shawnee chieftain Tecumseh when approached by him during the summer of 1810. Black Partridge said to Tecumseh, Although he advocated peace, he could not prevent the younger tribal members and warriors from joining Tecumseh's fight. He unsuccessfully tried to dissuade the Potawatomi from joining the attack at Fort Dearborn and, on the evening of August 14, 1812, he rode ahead of the main force arriving at Dearborn to return the medal to the fort commandant, Captain Nathan Heald.Dye, Eva Emery. The Conquest: The True Story of Lewis and Clark. Chicago: A.C. McClurg & Company, 1902. (pg. 358) During the ensuing Battle of Fort Dearborn, he and his brother Waubonsie tried to protect the settlers from the violence being carried out by the attackers. Black Partridge saved the life of a Mrs. Margaret Helm, the wife of Lieutenant Lenai T. Helm and stepdaughter of Indian trader John Kinzie, by holding her underwater under the appearance of drowning her in Lake Michigan. He later removed her to a nearby Indian camp where her wounds were dressed. Black Partridge also helped free her husband who was being held captive by the Red Head Chief at Kankakee. Delivering the ransom on behalf of U.S. Indian Agent Thomas Forsyth, he voluntarily offered his pony, rifle and a gold ring along with the original written order for $100 signed by General George Rodgers Clark.Dye, Eva Emery.

Most of these are either nearly universal in human blood or extremely rare and are rarely significant in a clinical setting. Reagents to test for these antigens are difficult to find and many cannot be purchased commercially. Blood group collections These three groups are antigens with shared characteristics but do not meet the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) definition of a human blood group system. Further research may identify them as blood group systems. This antibody is associated with WBC. It is associated more with tissue antibodies than red blood cells. It has not been associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia of the fetus. However, it does cause difficulty in the blood bank because it makes it more difficult to cross match blood for transfusions. =Cost= The Knops blood group system was formerly part of this collection. All that remains are the Csa and Csb antigens. Csa is a very high frequency (>98%) antigen and Csb is not uncommon (~34%). =Er= The Er collection includes one high incidence (>99%) antigen, Era and one (<1%) rare antigen, Erb. =Vel= The Vel collection includes the high incidence Vel and ABTI antigens.

Finding compatible units for transfusion to a patient that lacks one of these antigens is a major challenge and some countries maintain rare donor registries specifically for that purpose. *Lan antigen: anti-Lan is IgG and has been associated with transfusion reactions. A weaker variant of the antigen has also been reported. *Ata Antigen: only found in people of African descent. Associated with hemolytic transfusion reactions but not hemolytic disease of the newborn. *Jra Antigen: mostly found in Japan. Not associated with acute transfusion reactions. *AnWj Antigen: the receptor for Haemophilus influenzae. Implicated in severe hemolytic transfusion reactions. *Sda Antigen: This antigen is present on cells other than red cells and is less frequent but still very common. It may be associated with transfusion reactions, but not hemolytic disease of the newborn.

Biography  Born Ionel Perlea to a Romanian father, Victor Perlea, and a German mother, Margarethe Haberlein, in Ograda, Romania, he moved to Germany with his mother and his brothers after his father died. Perlea was five years old, or according to some sources, ten years old. He studied in Munich, then in Leipzig. He made his debut at a concert in Bucharest in 1919, then worked as r√©p√©titeur in Leipzig (1922‚Äì23) and Rostock (1923‚Äì25). His operatic debut as conductor occurred in Cluj-Napoca in 1927, when he directed Aida. The following year he made his first appearance at the Bucharest Opera, and was music director of that theatre from 1934 until 1944. He conducted several Romanian premieres of notable foreign masterpieces, such as Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg and Der Rosenkavalier. Now and then he made guest appearances in Vienna, Stuttgart, Breslau, Berlin, and Paris. In 1944, he and his wife were arrested in Vienna, Austria, while on their way to Paris. They were held under house arrest, or according to some sources, sent to Mariapfarr concentration camp, until the end of World War II. After the Second World War, he conducted mostly in Italy, notably at La Scala in Milan (1947‚Äì52; his first appearance there was in Samson et Dalila). In Italy, too, he conducted several local premieres such as Capriccio in Genoa, Mazeppa and The Maid of Orleans in Florence. He championed the new opera I due timidi by Nino Rota (better known as a composer of numerous film scores). For the 1949‚Äì50 season he was guest conductor at the Metropolitan Opera, giving performances of works such as Tristan und Isolde, Rigoletto, La traviata, and Carmen. Following a heart attack and a stroke in 1957, he learned to conduct with his left arm only, and preferred to concentrate on giving concerts and making records. He taught at the Manhattan School of Music from 1952 to 1969. He died in New York City in 1970, aged 69.

History A windmill was first recorded at this site in 1596.Heritage Mill, the seventh on this site, was built in 1830 at Highbrook, West Hoathly, where she was known as Hammingden Mill. In 1844 she was moved to Newhaven, replacing a mill that had burnt down. She was made redundant by the erection of a steam mill and was moved again, this time to her current location at Chailey, replacing a post mill. This second move was done by Medhurst, the Lewes millwright. Heritage Mill was working by wind until 1911. In 1928 the mill was tailwinded, and the cap and sails were blown off. The mill was restored in 1933. The work was done by Neve's, the Heathfield millwrights. A few years later, the mill was tailwinded again, and this time the windshaft snapped between the Brake Wheel and canister. Neve's installed the windshaft from Punnetts Town Windmill, which had been partly dismantled in 1935. Description The great spur wheel Heritage Mill is a three-storey smock mill on a single-storey brick base. It has a Kentish-style cap winded by a fantail.

This would mean that insurance companies would be regulated something like banks: they could choose either a state charter or a federal one. The proposed new federal regulatory system would be housed within the United States Department of the Treasury. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson came out in favor of an Optional Federal Charter on March 31, 2008.ustreas.gov Groups on both sides of the issue have offered numerous arguments for and against the concept. Proponents promise a freer, more open market for insurance that would benefit consumers, increase product innovation, and help the economy. Opponents, on the other hand, believe that a new federal regulator will impose burdensome bureaucratic rules, squelch competition, and needlessly increase federal power.ofcfaq.org Larger insurance companies which operate in multiple states favor the proposal,washingtonpost.com saying it would cut industry-wide costs by billions per year without reducing consumer protections and encourage free-market competition for insurance on the national level. They also say that the current state-run regulatory system makes it more difficult for insurers to bring innovative products to the market, and consumers are the ones who ultimately pay the price for the inefficiencies of the state-run regulatory system through higher prices. Groups that support an OFC include Agents For Change, the American Insurance Association, the United States Chamber of Commerce, and a variety of free-market groups such as the Competitive Enterprise Institute and FreedomWorks.ofcfaq.org Both the 2007 Bloomberg-Schumer Report schumer.senate.gov and the Financial Services Roundtable‚Äôs Blue Ribbon Commission on Mega Catastrophesfsround.org have called on Congress to enact Optional Federal Charter legislation. Opponents contend that insurers want an OFC because the current federal OFC bills would largely end the state practice of overseeing‚Äîand in some cases setting‚Äîthe particular rates that insurance companies charge.

The film went on general release across Turkey on and is one of the highest grossing Turkish films of 2008. Production Writer, producer and co-director √ñzhan Eren, an expert on the Caucasus Campaign in World War I, who came across the story of the 120 boys while doing the research for his bestselling The Road to Sarƒ±kamƒ±≈ü (), spent three years preparation for the film. The film, which received a record amount of support from the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism, was shot over two years in harsh conditions on location in Safranbolu, Van and Istanbul, Turkey. When heavy snow, expected in Van for the winter settings of the film, failed to arrive, 20 trucks, two loaders and 30 staff members had to be laid on to bring 300 tons of snow from √áaldƒ±ran to Van for several scenes. Plot During the Battle of Sarikamish, the Ottoman army runs out of ammunition and appeals for help to the people of Van, who happen to have supplies. However, the First World War is on and all the men are fighting at the four corners of the empire and therefore can not respond to the appeal. The young children of Van want to do something and when the principal of a school, who has lost a son in the war, suggests that they transport ammunition, 120 young boys aged 12 to 17 volunteer and take to the road. The movie tells the true story of the 120 boys and their sisters and mothers left behind, who wait for their return.

It was later enlarged to four full stories with a flat roof. A compact group of associated brick row houses and other buildings, including a handsome mansard-roofed office, also were built. This mill played a major role in 19th-century textile technology and was the site of the first large-scale test of the high-speed Sawyer spindle, one of the earliest of its type developed in the United States. The mill houses here are noteworthy for their simple form and dense arrangement. The village is tucked into a narrow, low flood plain site at the bottom of a bluff carrying Mendon Road (Rhode Island Route 122) in this section.

The house was probably built c. 1782 by Moses Ballou, from one of the first families to settle in the area, and was owned by his descendants through most of the 19th century.

Career The name 'Motley' derives from the word as used by Shakespeare. Motley met at art school in the 1920s and became John Gielgud's designers during the 1930s. They started teaching theatre design at Michel Saint-Denis's London Theatre Studio (1936‚Äì1939), the first time a design course had been incorporated into a drama school in the UK. Margaret Harris and Elizabeth Montgomery spent the Second World War in the United States, designing for Broadway, and Harris also worked with Charles Eames on his moulded plywood aeroplane parts. Sophie Harris, now married to George Devine, and mother of their child Harriet, stayed in the UK designing for stage and screen. After the war Margaret Harris returned to the UK, and both sisters once again joined Saint-Denis, teaching design at the Old Vic Theatre School (1947‚Äì1953). Elizabeth Montgomery stayed in the United States designing for many Broadway productions. All three continued to design under the name \\"Motley\\" for both stage and screen. The Motley design team were closely associated with the work of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre especially 1948‚Äì59. Productions included: 1948 Troilus and Cressida in which Paul Scofield played Troilus, the 1953 Antony and Cleopatra and 1957 As You Like It both featuring Peggy Ashcroft, The Merry Wives of Windsor in 1955 with Anthony Quayle, Hamlet in 1958 with Michael Redgrave in the title role, and Googie Withers as his mother, Gertrude; the production played in Moscow and Googie, who had moved to live in Australia with her actor and producer husband, John McCallum, was replaced by Coral Browne; and the 1959 King Lear with Charles Laughton. shakespeare.org.uk In 1966, Margaret Harris founded Motley Theatre Design Course which continued until 2011. The group won two Tony Awards for costume design and was nominated seven additional times. Motley Collection of Theatre and Costume Design The Motley Collection of Theatre and Costume Design is a source of documentation on the history of theatre and is housed in the Rare Book and Special Collections Library at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It is a collection of original materials on the theatre comprising over 5000 items from more than 150 productions in England and the United States. These materials include costume and set designs, sketches, notes, photographs, prop lists, storyboards, and swatches of fabric. After the members of the Motley Group had retired, Michael Mullin, a professor of English at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, met Margaret Harris and expressed an interest in the University acquiring the over 40 years worth of designs that the group had accumulated. After negotiations with Sotheby's, who had been contracted to auction the items, the University of Illinois finally reached an agreement in April 1981 to purchase the entire collection. This resource on the history of 20th- century theatre is preserved intact for study; the Library has digitised the collection in its entirety to make it publicly available.

Early life Born the son of Polish immigrants, he grew up in the Plateau-Mont-Royal district of Montreal, where he attended Baron Byng High School. One night, he got caught in his regular habit of sneaking into a local cinema, and correctly predicted to the manager that \\"One day I'll be presenting shows here, so you better let me in.\\" Gesser negotiated being allowed to remain if he helped to clean up after the shows, and reported having learnt much about all aspects of the entertainment business as a result. Working life Between 1949 and 1959 Gesser worked as a commercial artist, while writing hundreds of scripts for CBC radio and TV. During the late 1940s and early 1950s Gesser also travelled throughout Quebec making recordings of French Canadian fiddle tunes and folk songs, which he released on the Allied Records record label. In addition, he presented programs about folk music on CFCF and on the CBC. While browsing in a Chicago record store in 1948, he bought a disc by blues guitarist and singer Lead Belly released by Folkways Records, an American label not distributed in Canada. Gesser travelled to New York and after an unscheduled meeting with Folkways founder Moses Asch, became the Canadian representative for the label. Noticing that the Folkways catalog contained little Canadian folk music, Asch approved Gesser making recordings to fill the gap, provided he purchased a hundred copies of each. Inspired by ethnomusicologists Marius Barbeau, and Carmen Roy, and less concerned by sales than by a desire to preserve the music, Gesser went on to record and produce about 100 discs. Among the artists and folklorists he worked with were H√©l√®ne Baillargeon, Edith Fowke, Helen Creighton, Hyman Bress, Jean Carignan, Jacques Labrecque, Monique Leyrac, Alan Mills, Leonard Cohen and Irving Layton. Recognizing that concerts would help sell records, in 1953 Gesser brought folk singer Pete Seeger to Montreal, beginning a lifelong friendship. After months of work, Gesser made $200 on this first venture into concert promotion. He went on to be described as the \\"best impresario in the world\\" by singer Harry Belafonte, one of many artists whose concerts he produced in Montreal and elsewhere during a more than fifty- year career. Other acts included Nana Mouskouri, Joan Baez, Danny Kaye, Glenn Gould, Liberace, Janis Joplin, Maureen Forrester, Isaac Stern, The Band, Gordon Lightfoot, the Peking Opera, Monty Python's Flying Circus, the New York Philharmonic orchestra as well as Broadway musicals. Gesser also co-founded Les Feux Follets, a French-Canadian folk dance company in 1955. Gesser headed the entertainment for the Canadian pavilion at Montreal's Expo 67 world fair in 1967, presenting more than 400 shows. He repeated his role at the Osaka World Fair in Osaka, introducing many unknown Canadian artists to an international audience. In 1984 he produced and financed a musical adaptation of fellow Montrealer Mordecai Richler's The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz. The musical began a Canadian tour in Edmonton, but closed early in Ottawa, never transferring to Broadway as had been originally planned. Gesser wrote and produced the 2000 play \\"Fineman's Dictionary\\", a comedy starring Fyvush Finkel. A further play \\"Dancing to Beethoven\\" produced in 2003 featured a cast of blind actors. Weeks before his death from cancer, he was still working on screenplays that had been optioned for production, and was also writing a third play, \\"Seeing the Islands\\". Honours Gesser received the Order of Canada in 1993 for \\"contributing to Canada's cultural fabric.\\" He was also honoured by the Smithsonian Institution, the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Canadian Folk Walk of Fame and was the first recipient of the Resonance Award established by the Canadian Museum of Civilization to honour outstanding lifetime contributions to Canada's musical heritage. Gesser was described as \\"a quiet and gentle man\\", and \\"a gentleman in every sense of the word\\". He married twice, and had three children from his first marriage, one of whom predeceased him.

He established his own shop in 1913 at 72 rue Myrha in Paris (18th arrondissement). Other than his son, Marcel Gaston F√©tique, and his brother Jules F√©tique, Claude Thomassin, Auguste Toussain, Claude R√©my, Louis Morizot, Paul Weidhaas and Andre Richaume worked for him. Andre Vigneron (fils) was also known to have made bows for Victor Fetique.Jaak Liivoja, Victor F√©tique's bows in The Strad 93. 1982 Signed his bows \\"Vtor F√©tique.\\" His bows are patterned after those of Fran√ßois Nicolas Voirin, though less distinct. Victor F√©tique and his workshop made bows for numerous other music houses, including: Collin-Mezin, Granier √† Marseille, Caressa & Francais, Chanot & Chardon, J.B.L. Corolla (stamped Nadegini), Paul Jombar, Maucotel & Dechamp, Lucien Schmitt, and Alfred Vidoudez in Geneva. He was awarded for his personal production the title Meilleur Ouvrier de France (1st Craftsman of France). \\"Victor's best bows can be superb playing tools. Some examples which are mounted in G/T, are quite stunning.\\" Filimonov Fine Violins Gennady Filimonov \\"Victor Fetique was capable of producing some very good bows, but the attention of his atelier seemed to focus on quantity, and thus the output is frequently of a more commercial quality.\\" Stefan Hersh \\"It is difficult to define the style of a craftsman who worked for such a short time. As already told, his productions consists mainly of two parts. His personal one is influenced by the two schools who shaped him. In his first period he is influenced by his Maestro Charles Nicolas Bazin, later on he will get closer to the Parisian taste of that time: Sartory-Lamy. After the start of his health problems, also the bow quality is affected and has a sharp decrease. Those one made for him, follow his own stylistic shapes but not everybody has the same gifted hands and, as mentioned, the results are not always up to the expectations. In the last period, thanks to the closeness with his nephew Andre Richaume, excellent craftsman who will won an award as best \\"Ouvriers de France\\", his quality improves. Andr√® builds for his uncle beautiful bows, many mounted in tortoise and gold and he devotes his last years of his life to smooth the way for his descendant.\\" Paolo Sarri (translated from Italian) \\"Fetique, Victor: Very hard bows. Firm. Dense sound especially when dense wood used. Some (maybe a minority) poor examples from workshop stamped with his name. These can be short grained, for example. Very tense. Like a German bow but far far warmer in sound. Limited flexibility. Detache works well, however. Fascinating bows; probably the hardest French bow to have been made.\\" Roland Herrera References  * Dictionnaire Universel del Luthiers - Ren√© Vannes 1951,1972, 1985 (vol.3) * Universal Dictionary of Violin & Bow Makers - William Henley 1970 Category:1872 births Category:1933 deaths Category:People from Mirecourt Category:Bow makers Category:Luthiers Category:Bowed string instrument makers ","title":"Victor F√©tique"},{"id":"17345084","text":"Ban Chom is a village in Phouvong District in Attapeu Province of southeastern Laos.Maplandia world gazetteer References Category:Populated places in Attapeu Province Category:Phouvong District ","title":"Ban Chom"},{"id":"17345107","text":"Third-seeded Anna Chakvetadze was able to overcome Jelena Jankoviƒá to emerge the victor of the 2007 Ordina Open Women's Singles Competition.

The village is roughly bounded by Martin Street and Mendon Road on the north and east, railroad tracks to the west, and St. Joseph Cemetery to the south. The village, including a mill complex and mill employee housing, was built in 1872 by the Lonsdale Company. Most of the residential structures built are two-story brick duplexes, although Mendon Street is lined with a number of fine Queen Anne Victorian houses. A c. 1892 Stick-style church building (now used for non-religious purposes), stands on Mendon Street at the northern end of the district.

The group released the second-ever 45 rpm single of the famed 1960s‚Äô anthem \\"Get Together\\" ‚Äî later a classic by The Youngbloods ‚Äî on Dot Records (45-16868) in April 1966. Pam and Alan married in late 1967, forming the folk-rock group Ross Legacy and releasing Makes You Wanna Sigh, written by Pam‚Äôs brother and former Children of Rainer Denis, on the Philips label (40620) in 1969. At the encouragement of Music City mogul Buddy Killen, producer of R&B; immortal Joe Tex and countless country stars, including Dolly Parton, Dottie West and Roger Miller, Pam and Alan Ross moved to Nashville in late August 1969. Killen produced the duo and published Alan‚Äôs songs with Tree Publishing Company from September 1969 through 1971. The couple appeared on over 400 television shows emanating from Nashville, from 1969‚Äì74. Ross went on to a 34-year career as a jingle writer/producer and studio session singer, his voice heard on over 1,100 commercial soundtracks for radio and TV. He continues today as a recording and occasional performing artist under the name wm Alan Ross. Followers of record discographies, however, will not find the name Children of Rain under any Dot Records collections. Due to an inadvertent error on the label's part, their recording was released under the name Pam Meacham and the Children of Rain. Discographies continue to err, listing Pam's name only as the artist of record, and at that, misspelling it as Pam Meecham. But the dauntingly sparse information on the group didn‚Äôt prevent British music journalist Rob Cochrane from tracking them down in the summer of 2017‚Äî51 years after their only release on Dot. Cochrane was drawn initially to their music via the group‚Äôs melancholic and wistful name‚Äîobserved in March 2017 on an online auction. Cochrane shelved out $200 to purchase a rare eight-song acetate of the Children of Rain recorded at Delta Recording Corp., in New York City in late 1966, to see if the music matched the level of the group‚Äôs name. ‚ÄúThey possess a spirited but haunting melancholia, a stunning back-bone of considered song-craft,‚Äù says Cochrane in his Sept. 2017 article on the Children of Rain for Culture Catch, ‚Äúand had they fared better at the hands of time they would now undoubtedly be revered as innovators.‚Äù In response to Cochrane‚Äôs article, the Children of Rain released the album \\"Revisited\\" globally, via CDBaby.com, on Dec. 11, 2017.

One third of the council was up for election and the Conservative party gained overall control of the council from no overall control. After the election, including the delayed election in Harlow Common, the composition of the council was *Conservative 19 *Liberal Democrats 8 *Labour 6 Background After the last election in 2007 both the Conservative and Labour parties had 12 seats, the Liberal Democrats had 8 and there was 1 independent councillor. However, in October 2007 the Conservatives gained a seat from Labour in Toddbrook to move to 13 seats, while Labour dropped to 11. Before the election the council was run by a coalition between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, which had held power in Harlow since 2004. Among the councillors to stand down at the election were Liberal Democrat Su Lawton of Staple Tye ward and independent, former Conservative, John Paul Goddard of Sumners and Kingsmoor.

The Conservatives took seats from Labour in Little Parndon and Hare Street and Toddbrook, from the Liberal Democrats in Netteswell and Staple Tye and from an independent in Sumners and Kingsmoor.

The character was played by Carrie Mitchum on a contract basis from 1987 to 1991, and made guest appearances from 1994 to 1995 and 2001. In 2001, the role was portrayed by Mary Sheldon, and then by Jennifer Gareis as a series regular from 2006 to 2015. From 2015 to 2018, Gareis appeared in a recurring capacity. In January 2018, Gareis teased her return to the serial via her social media accounts. In September 2018, Gareis announced she was once again appearing in a regular capacity and she made her return on October 29, 2018. Storylines =1987‚Äì2001= Donna Logan was concerned about her younger sister Katie, who had low self-esteem due to excessive acne, and convinced Donna's classmate, Rocco Carner, to date her. Rocco was attracted to Donna, but she was already involved with Mark Mallory and was residing with him. When Donna realised Mark wasn't right for her, she kicked him out of her life, but she and Rocco were never able to make a go of their relationship. Donna was hired to model for Tommy Bayland, who referred her to agent Nick Preston, who convinced Donna to pose nude for a magazine in Europe. Media mogul Bill Spencer saw the photos and published them in a US magazine, leading Donna to join forces with Nick and Rocco to take nude pictures of Bill to publish in his own magazines. Donna eventually confessed to what she did to Bill and asked Bill to transfer her father Stephen, who worked for Bill's company, back to Los Angeles from Paris, but Stephanie Forrester opposed that idea. After a failed relationship with Thorne Forrester, Donna left Los Angeles for San Francisco, and returned for special occasions. In 2001 she returned to Los Angeles with all her family, but in this occasion. =2006‚Äì= Donna returned to LA in 2006, and immediately began trying to persuade her sister Brooke, who had now married Nick Marone, to take Ridge back, reminding her of how long she had fought to keep him. When Donna was unsuccessful in convincing her sister to return to Ridge, she went after him herself. This eventually failed, when she realized that Brooke and Ridge would always be connected. She was then engaged to marry Thorne Forrester. However it ended soon after when Donna's younger sister, Katie revealed that Donna was only with Thorne out of spite and revenge rather than actual love. Donna then became involved with Eric Forrester who was still married. He later divorced Stephanie to be with Donna. This sparked a rivalry between Donna and Stephanie's younger sister Pamela who was desperate to see Stephanie and Eric reunite. Eric and Donna eventually married, much to Pam's dismay. However their marriage was not without problems. Eric's daughter Felicia had allied herself with her brothers, Thorne and Ridge, to eliminate Donna out of Forrester Creations, because of the supposed bad publicity that the company had received since Eric married Donna (of whom none of them approve). Their efforts had been not too well received by Eric, who was angry that his children aren't willing to give Donna a chance. Even their mother Stephanie encouraged them to drop their animosity toward her, if only for their father's sake. During a business meeting at Forrester Creations, it was revealed by Felicia that when Donna was eighteen she had given up a baby boy for adoption. Marcus Walton , a new employee at Forrester, was revealed to be Donna's son. Thorne and Felicia attempted to use this information to drive Donna out of the company, but were shocked when Eric adopted Marcus. After Eric suffered a heart attack, and was revealed to have been poisoned, Felicia continued to ally with her brothers in eliminating Donna's presence from their lives. When Eric awoke from his coma, Felicia helped to reunite him with Stephanie; though this reunion proved short-lived and he eventually returned to Donna much to Felicia and her brothers' chagrin. Bill Spencer, Jr. had his sights set on Donna but later turned his attention to Katie. After Spencer Publications took over Forrester Creations, Donna was reunited with her old high school flame, Justin Barber, who is vice-president at Spencer Publications. Donna confided in Katie that Justin was the father of her son, Marcus. After agonizing over the decision of whether or not to tell Justin about Marcus, Donna decided to keep silent about the matter, but Justin quickly learned of Donna's son, and, after an intense confrontation with Donna, learned that he was Marcus's father. Justin demanded that Donna let him know his son, and Donna reluctantly agreed. Donna and Eric end their marriage and Justin and Donna rekindle their relationship and get married soon after. However it was short-lived and they divorced months later. They remain friends as well as loving parents to Marcus and loving grandparents to their granddaughter, Rosie. Donna then started a relationship with Nick Marone, but it ended quickly after it was revealed that he and his mother stole designs from Forrester. Donna later finds out about Bill's many schemes to break up his son, Liam, and Donna's niece, Hope. She confronts Bill and informs him that she will not stay quiet. However she later changes her mind when she finds Liam and his ex-wife, Steffy, together intimately. Donna encourages her niece to move on from Liam as she does not want to see Hope get hurt. Hope finds out later that Donna and several others knew about Bill's actions however Hope forgives her aunt. Donna then gets caught up in another scandal of Bill's when he and her older sister, Brooke had an affair whilst he was still married to their younger sister, Katie. The affair resulted in a pregnancy and miscarriage. Later when Bill leaves Katie for Brooke, Donna ended up in the middle of it and tries to mediate a reconciliation between her two sisters, unsuccessfully. Donna then becomes rivals with jewelry designer Quinn Fuller as they compete for Eric. Donna moves to Dallas to be with her father. In October 2016, Donna briefly returns for Brooke and Bill's wedding, which ends up not happening due to Ridge's interference. In December 2017, Donna returns to spend Christmas with her sisters. In February 2018, Donna attends Brooke and Ridge‚Äôs wedding. In May and August 2018, Donna returns twice for Hope and Liam's wedding. In September 2018, Donna returns for Katie and Thorne‚Äôs wedding, and moves permanently back to Los Angeles the following month.

Cristall batted and threw left-handed. His playing height and weight were listed as 5 foot 7 inches and 145 lbs. He was Jewish. Baseball career Cristall made his major league debut on September 3, 1901. His time in the major leagues was short, as he only started and pitched in six career games. His career numbers were not so impressive, as his win-loss record would be 1‚Äì5, although he did pitch 5 complete games and his one win was a shutout. Although he had very few at bats, he was a respectable hitter, especially for a pitcher, as he had 7 hits in 20 at-bats, including two hits for triples, and finished with a career .350 batting average. Cristall finished his career with a fielding percentage of .957, making only one error in his six starts. His last game would be on September 28, 1901. He was the first professional baseball player to be born in Ukraine, and is one of only three players in Major League history, (the other two being Reuben Ewing and Izzy Goldstein) to have been born in Ukraine. He is also the only Ukrainian baseball player to record a victory, a strikeout, a walk, a win, a loss, a complete game, a shutout, and a hit batter in major league history. He died on January 28, 1939 in Buffalo, New York.

At the United Kingdom Census 2011, it had a population of 1,979.Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Burnley Retrieved 4 February 2010 The parish adjoins the Burnley parishes of Dunnockshaw, Habergham Eaves and Padiham and Lowerhouse area of Burnley, the Hyndburn parish of Altham and Huncoat area of Accrington and the Loveclough area of Rossendale. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal and M65 motorway both pass through the village. History The name Hapton is thought to have been derived from the Old English words and meaning the enclosure on the hill. The civil parish of Hapton is thought to be the amalgamation of three medieval manors. Hapton is linked to the original castle and village that would later develop near it. To the northwest lies Shuttleworth, thought to be the origin of the family better known at Gawthorpe Hall. The third manor was called Birtwistle and its location is uncertain, but has been suggested to have been near the site of Hapton Tower. The ancient township extended from the River Calder in the north, over the Hameldon Hills to the Forest of Rossendale in the south. The castle of Hapton once stood on the eastern side of Castle Clough, on the edge of a precipitous slope. Nothing is known of its origin. Further up the hill in Hapton Park, however, Hapton Tower was constructed about 1510 by Sir John Towneley (1473-1540) and was inhabited until 1667. The tower was a large square building about high with, on one side, the remains of three round towers with conical bases. It reportedly had two main entrances opposite each other. Both castle and tower were in ruins after the Restoration and today hardly anything remains of either. The only masonry of the castle now visible is a length of wall about long and thick and four courses high under two trees. From the Haptons the land passed to the de Leghs, when John de Hapton's daughter Cecilia married Richard de Legh in 1205. In the 12th century part of the manor was granted to William de Arches by Robert de Lacey. In 1328 Gilbert de la Legh, the manager of the cattle farms in the forests, purchased the manor of Hapton and in 1356 his grandson, also called Gilbert acquired Birtwistle. His son John would marry Cecilia one of the co-heirs of Towneley Hall and their grandson John Towneley would later take control of all three manors. In 1482, Sir John Towneley succeeded to the estates at the age of nine, when his father, also called Richard, died of wounds obtained during the capture of Berwick Castle. He was married to Isabella Pilkington, the daughter of his guardian and later served as a soldier, being awarded a knighthood in 1497. With Royal permission he enclosed the manors of Towneley and Hapton, which he connected with the illegal enclosure of Horelaw Hill. After the King's commissioners re-let the Forest of Rossendale to local farmers in 1507, Towneley in 1514 enlarged his park at Hapton to embrace 1100 Lancashire acres (, about half of the township) making it the second largest in historic Lancashire after that of the Earl of Derby at Knowsley. An astute businessman he bought land, corn mills and corn tithes. He was High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1532. His enclosure of this land seems to have made him unpopular, as an old local legend claims that his ghost haunts the hills. In his will dated 1627, Richard Towneley (1566-1628) left all his armour at Whalley to his son Richard. The will of Richard's wife Jane, dated 1633, provides the last recorded instance of the Towneleys at Hapton Tower. Parts of the Tower are thought to have been incorporated into other buildings including Dyneley Hall in Cliviger, Browsholme Hall in Bowland and closer to the site at Watson Laithe Farm. By 1661 the lower part of the Park, north of the Tower extending to Habergham Brook, had been divided into large enclosures and these were subsequently divided into smaller ones that are still worked by today's farmers. The land would remain with the Towneley estate, descending to Caroline Louisa, eldest daughter and co-heir of Colonel Charles Towneley and wife of Montagu Bertie, 7th Earl of Abingdon, who put 2,500 acres in Hapton up for sale in 1923. Shuttleworth has been occupied since at least the 14th-century. Henry de Shuttleworth died before 1325 holding lands in Shuttleworth of John son and heir of Edmund Talbot. The estate was purchased by the Starkies of Huntroyde Hall in 1734. Shuttleworth Hall is about north-west of the town along the A6068 road toward Padiham. The house dates from 1639 and is a working farmhouse. Manchester Road appears on a map of 1661, and is likely part of an old route from Padiham over the moor to Haslingden. Although the Leeds and Liverpool Canal opened to Burnley in 1801, the stretch from Hapton to Blackburn was not completed until 1810 and it was 1816 before it connected to Liverpool. A Wharf was situated near the Hapton Bridge presumably to serve Padiham. Accrington Road was the last of the Turnpike trust roads to be built in the local area in 1827. The Castle Clough Works was established as a cotton spinning mill in 1792, where the old road to Shuttleworth crosses Castle Clough Brook, possibly the site of an earlier corn mill. The present village of Hapton is largely a product of the Industrial revolution. By the time of first Ordnance Survey map of the area, published in the 1840s, tram roads cross Stone Moor to the north, connecting the Wharf to collieries there, with more coal mines evident near the castle site. The Castle Clough Works was labelled as a dye works, but the rest of the township is still rural. The Hapton Chemical Works was established by Riley and Smalley on the northern side of the canal and east side of Manchester Road in 1842 to provide chemical products for the textile trade. It was taken over by William Blythe by 1915. St Margaret's CofE Church. Although the East Lancashire railway line was constructed through the township in 1848, the railway station didn't open until the 1860s. Perseverance Mill was built for John Simpson in 1867 and had an attached magneto works. In 1888, Walter and Joseph Simpson established an Electrical Engineering company in Hapton called Simpson Bros. They specialised in the electrification of cotton mills and to promote the new business they installed three electric street lights, making Hapton the first village in Britain with electric lighting. By the 1890s about a dozen streets of terraced houses extended from the mill, along Manchester Road to the station. The chemical factory covered approximately the same area as the village and had its own sidings. Another weaving shed, Robert Walton‚Äôs Hapton Mill, was erected on the canal in 1905-6 and there was also Mathers Brick & Tile Works, the site later occupied by Lucas Industries and redeveloped for residential use in the 1990s. The only inn in Hapton before 1848 was the Towneley Arms which was situated in a no longer extant building on the north- east corner of the Lane Ends road junction. The Hapton Inn, across Accrington Road was established in the later 1800s. A schoolhouse is also existed in 1848, on Manchester Road, then in an isolated position north of Lane ends. St Margaret's Church was founded in 1914, with Church of England services previously held in the schoolroom. By 1931, although housing in the village had approximately doubled, only the Church, vicarage, new school, recreation ground and a handful of houses existed south of the railway. However Lane Ends, on the Burnley Accrington Road had developed into a hamlet. By 1961 semi-detached housing had extended along Manchester Road to Lane Ends. Geography Read Hall Park. At the southern end of the parish are the Hameldon Hills, the summits of which attain and . On the western side Castle Clough Brook runs north through a significant valley to join the Calder at Eaves Barn, however it is Shorten Brook further west that forms the actual boundary. On the eastern side New Barn Clough also flows north to join Habergham Brook, which along with Hapton Clough forms Green Brook at Spa Wood. In the centre a number of small streams combine to form Shaw Brook, which flows on the eastern side of the village and joins Green Brook just before its confluence with the Calder in Padiham. The underlying geology of the Hapton area consists of Lower Westphalian coal measures of the Carboniferous era, while the hills are formed of Carboniferous sandstones, ranging from millstone grits to finer grained stone such as the Dyneley Knott flags and the Dandy Mine Rock. The drift cover consists primarily of glacial till deposits, which cause poor-drainage soils, meaning the grassland is prone to reed growth. A fault known as the Deerplay fault runs in a north-westerly direction under the eastern side of the parish toward Lowerhouse. There is a Site of Biological Importance at Mill Hill, Castle Clough Woods. There are many native and visiting varieties of birds, plants and animals. In addition to UK common species, green and lesser-spotted woodpecker, willow tit, yellow wagtail, woodcock and herons have all been spotted in the area. Water vole, newt and frog can be found on the steeper-sided river embankments and in large marshy wet areas by the stone bridge at the ford known as Castle Clough South and Childers Green. Bluebells grow in abundance. The entire area was classed as an area of Biological Heritage to be protected under Lancashire County Council's Local Plan for Burnley. There is free parking at Mill Hill Picnic area, about upstream of the ford. The Burnley Way passes through the parish, passing Shuttleworth and following Castle Clough and the part of the old road to Haslingden as it climbs over Hameldon to Clow Bridge. Governance Hapton was once a township in the ancient parish of Whalley. This became a civil parish in 1866, forming part of the Burnley Rural District from 1894 (until 1974). However, in 1894, the Padiham Green area of the parish transferred to Padiham and Clowbridge to Dunnockshaw. There were further boundary changes in 1935 when the parish lost another small area to Padiham but gained a detached part of Dunnockshaw. 2004 saw the parish loose more territory in the north to Padiham, with an area in Lowerhouse transferred to Burnley. The village gives its name to the Hapton with Park ward of the Borough of Burnley, which also includes the eastern areas of Padiham. In recent years this ward has shown high levels of support for the British National Party, electing a BNP councillor in 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008. After the 2010 elections, the borough's only remaining BNP councillors were those elected by this ward.Burnley Borough Council Accessed 2010 Sharon Wilkinson lost the final seat in 2012, a decade since the far-right group were first elected to the council. Economy Buildings at the former Hapton Valley Colliery. On the eastern side of the parish a colliery began in 1853 at Spa Wood, this would develop into a significant enterprise known as Hapton Valley Colliery, which would survive to be Burnley‚Äôs last deep mine, operating until 1982. By the 1890s a tram road connected it to Porters Gate Colliery in the southeast and Barclay Hills Colliery in the northeast and ultimately to a coal yard on the canal at Gannow in Burnley. A number of smaller quarries on the hills south of the village grown by 1886 into the Hameldon Quarries when Henry Heys and Co took over the operation. It supplied large quantities of flagstones for the construction of mills in Burnley and Padiham. At that time tram roads connected the main site to another at Snipe Rake and to a facility at Park Gate Farm. These quarries ceased operation in 1909, but extensive remains are still exist. Another on the canal west of the village (Hapton Hall) was worked until 1914. During World War II the Government funded the construction of plant for Magnesium Elektron at Pollard Moor to produce metals for the aircraft industry. It closed afterward, and was later occupied by Hepworth Building Products. Since 2010, with the construction of a new bridge over the canal, the site has been redeveloped into the Burnley Bridge Business Park. It neighbours the Network 65 business park, developed in the 2000s, both connecting to junction 9 on the M65 motorway. The William Blythe factory, which at its peak employed 1,000 people, closed in 2006. Ownership of the site passed to multi-national Synthomer PLC (then Yule Catto), who funded work to remediate the land for future housing use. At the time of 2011 census only 14 people where listed as long-term unemployed in the parish, with the most common employment sectors being manufacturing, retail, health and education.
