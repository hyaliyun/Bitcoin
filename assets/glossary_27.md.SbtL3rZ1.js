Published in Turkish in 2002, it was translated into English by Maureen Freely and published in 2004. The story encapsulates many of the political and cultural tensions of modern Turkey and successfully combines humor, social commentary, mysticism, and a deep sympathy with its characters. Kar is the word for Snow, but the main character also abbreviates his name to Ka (his initials), with the novel set in the eastern Turkish city of Kars. An opening (and recurring) theme concerns reasons behind a suicide epidemic among teenage girls (which actually took place in the city of Batman). Plot summary Though most of the early part of the story is told in the third person from Ka's point of view, an omniscient narrator sometimes makes his presence known, posing as a friend of Ka's who is telling the story based on Ka's journals and correspondence. This narrator sometimes provides the reader with information before Ka knows it or foreshadows later events in the story. At times, the action seems somewhat dream-like. The story is set in the city of Kars which creates a sense of alienation for Ka as the city is unlike anywhere else in Turkey, due to its history as a Russian garrison town. Ka is a poet, who returns to Turkey after 12 years of political exile in Germany. He has several motives, first, as a journalist, to investigate a spate of suicides but also in the hope of meeting a woman he used to know. Heavy snow cuts off the town for about three days during which time Ka is in conversation with a former communist, a secularist, a fascist nationalist, a possible Islamic extremist, Islamic moderates, young Kurds, the military, the Secret Service, the police and in particular, an actor-revolutionary. In the midst of this, love and passion are to be found. Temporarily closed off from the world, a farcical coup is staged and linked melodramatically to a stage play. The main discussion concerns the interface of secularism and belief but there are references to all of Turkey's twentieth century history. Plot Ka reunites with a woman named ƒ∞pek, whom he once had feelings for, whose father runs the hotel he is staying in. Ipek is divorced from Muhtar, partly due to Muhtar's newfound interest in political Islam. In a caf√©, Ka and Ipek witness the shooting of the local Director of the Institute of Education by a Muslim extremist from out of town. The shooter blames the director for the death of a young woman named Teslime, claiming she killed herself because of the director's ban on head-scarves in school. After the incident, Ka visits Muhtar, who tells him about his experience of finding Islam, which relates to a blizzard and meeting a charismatic sheikh named Saadettin Efendi. The police pick up Ka and Muhtar as part of their investigation of the Director's murder. Ka is questioned and Muhtar is beaten. Though he has suffered from writer's block for a number of years, Ka suddenly feels inspired and composes a poem called \\"Snow\\", which describes a mystic experience. Other poems follow. At ƒ∞pek's suggestion, Ka goes to see Sheikh Saadettin and confesses that he associates religion with a backwardness that he does not want himself or Turkey to fall into. But he feels a sense of comfort with the sheikh and begins to accept his new poems as gifts from God. Other significant characters Ka encounters include a wanted Muslim radical named Blue and ƒ∞pek's younger sister Kadife, who has become the leader of the \\"head-scarf girls\\", those who insist upon being \\"covered\\". Through Kadife, he meets another head-scarf girl, Hande, who suggested suicide to Teslime but insists she did not intend for the girl to follow through. Throughout the book, the insistence upon wearing a head-scarf, which places these girls in opposition to the state authorities and entails enormous pressures and sacrifices, is described as an act of empowerment and assertion of their identity as women; in one passage, Ka refers to them as \\"Islamic Feminists\\". Ka is impressed by Necip, a student at the religious high school, who, like many of the young Muslims at the school, is quite taken by Kadife. The narrator lets the reader know that Necip will die soon. Growing tensions between secularists and Islamists explode during a televised event at the National Theater. A secular group puts on a classic play condemning head scarves; during the play, a number of soldiers take positions on stage. The leader of the theater group receives a messenger and announces the death of the Director of the Institute of Education. Immediately after this, the soldiers on stage start firing at the audience. Necip is among those killed. The police and military establish martial law, and Ka is taken in for questioning because he has been seen with Islamists. He is shattered to find Necip's body in the morgue and identifies him as the one who led him to Blue. Ka is taken to meet Sunay Zaim, an actor whose group put on the play at the National Theater and who is now orchestrating the round-ups and investigations of suspicious persons. Zaim is a staunch Turkish Republican, who has played political leaders such as Robespierre, Napoleon and Lenin, but whose dream of playing Atat√ºrk, the founder of the Turkish Republic, was frustrated. As the snow has made the roads and railroads impassable, no outside authorities are able to intervene in the coup. The isolation of Kars, and Zaim's's old friendship with the officer in charge of the local garrison, enabled him to become a revolutionary dictator in real life as well as on the stage, for at least a few days ‚Äî his act being simultaneously a coup d'√©tat and a coup de th√©√¢tre. Kadife then takes Ka to speak with Blue, her lover. Ka convinces Blue that he has a contact at a newspaper in Germany who will print a statement denouncing the coup if Blue can get support from non-Islamists. To further this fiction, Ka returns to his hotel to convince Kadife and ƒ∞pek's leftist father Turgut Bey to collaborate on the statement. After the father and Kadife leave, Ka's longing for ƒ∞pek is fulfilled when the two make love. At this point, the narrator, who identifies himself as a novelist named Orhan, flashes forward four years and reveals that Ka spent the last years of his life obsessing over ƒ∞pek and writing unsent letters to her before being murdered in Frankfurt. The narrator will play a much larger role in the story in the later chapters of the novel. We are clearly meant to identify the narrator with Orhan Pamuk himself, as he later names The Black Book as one of his works, as well as The Museum of Innocence, which he would publish in 2008. Turgut Bey attends a meeting at which representatives from the various factions opposed to the coup, including Islamists, leftists, and Kurds, attempt to produce a coherent statement to the European press denouncing the action. After Blue is arrested and held by the nationalists, Ka negotiates a deal with Sunay Zaim that will result in Blue's release, as long as Kadife agrees to play a role in Zaim's production of Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy and removes her head-scarf on live television during the show. Both Kadife and Blue agree. Ka is soon picked up and beaten by two secret policemen working for Z Demerkol, a nationalist, who is looking for Blue and also wants to counter what he sees as Ka's influence. He tells Ka that ƒ∞pek had an affair with Blue while she was married to Muhtar and still keeps in contact with him. ƒ∞pek confesses the affair and indicates that Kadife only got involved with Blue out of envy. Ka's jealousy is intense and the two fall asleep after weeping together. They reassure each other they can still be happy in Frankfurt. However, before they can leave, Ka must convince Kadife not to take her head-scarf off during the play, as both ƒ∞pek and Turgut Bey have become very concerned at the possible reaction of the students from the religious school. Despite Ka's urging, Kadife insists on uncovering herself during the performance. After a scene in which Ka is seen confused and tormented by feelings of pain and jealousy, the narrative describing events from his point of view abruptly breaks off. The narrator explains that Ka had left behind a detailed account of his acts and feelings while in Kars, but that there was no reference to his last hours in the city, and it is left to his friend Orhan to try to reconstruct these by following in Ka's footsteps, visiting the places where he had been and meeting the people he had met. Ka's actions immediately after leaving the theater remain a mystery which is never completely untangled. Orhan is, however, able to establish that Ka was later taken by the military to the train station, where he was put on the first train scheduled to leave once the railroad reopened. Ka complied, but sent soldiers to retrieve ƒ∞pek for him. However, just as ƒ∞pek said her farewells to her father, news arrived that Blue and Hande were shot. ƒ∞pek was shattered and blamed Ka for leading the police to Blue's hideout. Instead of going to Ka, she and her father went to the theater to see Kadife. The novel's narrator then describes events at the theater as if he has reconstructed them from various sources. Kadife and Zaim have an on-stage discussion about suicide and the different reasons why men and women kill themselves. A garret and noose are set up, and Zaim hands Kadife a gun after he demonstrates that it is not loaded. When Kadife shoots Zaim, much of the audience assumes his death is staged, and even Kadife appears to be surprised that the gun is in fact loaded. Zaim had clearly prepared and orchestrated his own death on stage, \\"pushing art to its farthest limits\\" and preferring to die at the peak of his theatrical and political career. Soon afterwards, as the snow has subsided, Ka's train departs and local authorities enter the town to stifle the coup and restore order. Years later, the narrator goes to Kars to uncover details on Ka's story. He meets with many of the principals, including Kadife, who served very little time for what was ruled an accidental homicide and is now married to a student from the religious school. Meeting ƒ∞pek, the narrator himself falls deeply in love with her and becomes intensely jealous of his dead friend (and of the dead Blue). He tells ƒ∞pek that Ka was a shattered man who never forgot about her, but was prevented from returning to Kars owing to a warrant for his arrest. ƒ∞pek is still convinced that Ka betrayed Blue. Indeed, the narrator finds evidence that suggests that Ka went back to talk to the police after his visit to the theater and probably told them where to find Blue. ƒ∞pek has remained unmarried, does not expect to ever find love again, and devotes herself to her nephew. In the end it is disclosed that a new group of Islamic militants was formed by younger followers of Blue who had been forced into exile in Germany and based themselves in Berlin, vowing to take revenge for the death of their admired leader. It is assumed that one of them assassinated Ka and took away the only extant copy of the poems he had written in Kars. Thus, while much is told about the names of these poems, their themes and the circumstances under which each was written, the poems themselves are lost.

She is one of the serial's original characters, appearing in its first episode on 19 February 1985 and departing on-screen in May 1989. Created by Tony Holland and Julia Smith, Sue is portrayed as argumentative, insecure and tragic. A pivotal storyline in the character's narrative is the cot-death of her son, which was one of the show's first controversial plots. During her four years on-screen, the character contends with a phantom pregnancy, marital breakdown and finally insanity. Ratcliff left the role in 1989. Storylines=Backstory Sue's parents had her late in life; they were not demonstrative towards each other or to her. In 1982, Sue married Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih), a Turkish Cypriot, and gave birth to their first baby Hassan in May 1984. Together they lease and run the Bridge street caf√® in Walford and are the first known owners of the premises. 1985‚Äì1989 Sue is shown to be a woman who does not shy away from speaking her mind. She has various altercations, particularly with dowager Lou Beale (Anna Wing), who accuses Sue of having no community spirit. Sue's suspicious, insecure nature also provokes arguments between her and Ali, whom she often accuses of cheating. She has rows with other female residents, including Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), Angie Watts (Anita Dobson), Debbie Wilkins (Shirley Cheriton), Mary Smith (Linda Davidson) and Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), whom she suspects are trying to seduce her husband, although in truth, all that ever occurs is flirtation. In June 1985, tragedy strikes for the Osmans when Sue awakes to discover baby Hassan laying motionless in his cot. Sue and Ali rush his lifeless body to local nurse Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson), but Hassan is already dead. A postmortem reveals no definitive cause of death, so it is concluded that he died during his sleep from cot death. After discovering Hassan's body, Sue goes into shock. She remains in a trance like state for weeks, refusing to eat, sleep, cry or acknowledge her own grief. She later begins blaming herself unfairly for her son's sudden and unexplainable death. Her mental health continues to deteriorate and she becomes despondent towards Ali; their marriage disintegrates in a welter of depression. Sue eventually manages to come to terms with Hassan's death with the help of Dr Legg (Leonard Fenton), who takes the desperate measure of placing Mary's baby, Annie, in her lap, allowing her, finally, to acknowledge her pent-up sadness. Sue obsesses with the idea of having another child but no matter how hard she and Ali try, they cannot conceive. A phantom pregnancy in May 1986 leaves her heartbroken and she later tries to convince Michelle to let her adopt Michelle's daughter Vicki, culminating in Michelle slapping Sue. In September, Sue begins toying with the idea of adopting a Turkish child from Cyprus, which is met with indignation from Ali's family. She and Ali decide to apply to adopt in the UK instead. They meet a social worker to assess their suitability; however, their application is rejected because it is felt they are applying too quickly after the death of their child. Sue agonizes over this and in 1987, she faces more turmoil after finding a lump on her breast; she fears she has breast cancer. After much worrying, she is eventually persuaded to get the lump checked out and is subsequently given the all-clear. Later in the year, Sue grows attached to Ali's nephews and niece when they come to stay with her in Walford, and is saddened when they go home several months later. Still unable to conceive, Sue begins to crave a baby more than ever and Ali tires of her eternal broodiness. Sue decides she wants to move to the Isle of Dogs, thinking that the milder climate may increase her chances of conceiving. Ali refuses and in a fury, Sue packs a suitcase and disappears without word. Ali believes she has left him, but Sue is only visiting an old school friend and she returns in October 1987 to announce that she is expecting another baby. In March 1988, she gives birth to another son, \\"Little Ali\\", who is delivered by Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt) and Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard). Sue's desperation to be a good mother means that she often excludes her husband from parental duties. She becomes so obsessed with her baby's welfare that she has no time for Ali and their relationship suffers. Feeling neglected and tired of his wife's nagging, Ali has sex with Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler). However, Donna blackmails Ali, threatening to inform Sue about their tryst unless he pays her regularly. A fearful Ali pays, silencing Donna for a while, but in March 1989 Sue argues with Donna, banning her from the caf√©. In retaliation, Donna informs Sue about the affair. Upset, Sue turns to Ali's brother Mehmet (Haluk Bilginer) for comfort and attempts to kiss an innocent Mehmet in front of Ali for revenge. Believing that Sue is having an affair with his brother, Ali assaults Mehmet then informs Mehmet's wife Guizin (Ishia Bennison) about the fabricated affair, causing the Osman family to fracture. Following threats from Ali, Sue takes their son and leaves Walford. Ali spends months trying to track his estranged wife down. He eventually finds her visiting their dead son's grave. While she is distracted, Ali snatches his son and this is the final straw for Sue's fragile emotional state and losing Little Ali causes her to have a breakdown. Despondent and unresponsive, she is sectioned and admitted to a psychiatric hospital in May 1989. Just over three months later towards the end of August, Kathy Beale visits Sue off-screen and tells Ali that Sue wants contact with their son, but he refuses to allow her access.  Creation  Sue Osman was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. British Sue and her Turkish Cypriot husband Ali, were an attempt to portray a multi-cultural relationship, with an emphasis on conflicting customs, cultural and personality differences. Their marriage was scripted to be volatile, highlighting the problems that can occur when customs and beliefs are not shared in a relationship. Sue's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, EastEnders: The Inside Story. Sue as she appeared in 1985. Holland and Smith required the character of Sue to appear 'hard', but also to be a 'loser' and a 'victim'. They initially considered casting the role of Sue to Gillian Taylforth, the actress who would go on to play Kathy Beale in the serial. In the end she was rejected because she had blonde hair and they had always envisioned Sue to be a brunette. Sandy Ratcliff (previously a model who was cast as Lord Snowdon's face of the seventies) was recommended for the role by the writer Bill Lyons. Ratcliff was invited in for audition. Holland and Smith were struck by her appearance, suggesting she had \\"one of the most photogenic faces on television\\". They suggested that she had a \\"toughness in her face and manner, a fiery gypsy-like quality.\\" and that she sounded \\"East-end enough\\". Holland and Smith surmised that Ratcliff would clearly be competent at playing the \\"hard\\" aspect to Sue's character, but they were not originally certain that Ratcliff would be able to portray the loser and victim aspects as convincly because, on the surface, Ratcliff appeared to be the exact opposite. Ratcliff was renowned for being a staunch feminist and a political actress; Holland and Smith initially feared that her own personality and strongly held views would be at odds with the character. For instance, Ratcliff requested that they make the cafe that Sue was scripted to run into a \\"women's-only bookshop\\". Ratcliff was also not renowned for being the most disciplined actress, 'more the free spirit', which sparked fears over how she would react to the strict disciplines of a twice-weekly drama. However, it was eventually decided that Ratcliff did possess all the qualities that were needed to play Sue convincingly and, despite initial objections from Ratcliff's agent who did not approve of her artists appearing in soap operas, she become \\"hot favourite\\" for the role. Although auditioning for Sue was done first, the casting could not be confirmed until an actor was found to play her husband, Ali. Ratcliff was brought in at a later date to read scripts with two potential actors, Nejdet Salih and Haluk Bilginer (two out of only three working Turkish speaking actors in London at the time). The creators differed in opinion on which of the two they wanted to have the role; it was initially felt that Ratcliff would \\"make mincemeat\\" out of Salih, but following a successful reading, it was eventually decided that Salih and Ratcliff worked as the Osman partnership and were cast as Sue and Ali. Bilginer was cast as Ali's brother Mehmet. Development Sue has been described as \\"highly strung\\" with a parlous emotional state. Author Hilary Kingsley has suggested that Sue was a character who was \\"dogged by tragedy\\". She suggested that Sue was a \\"moaner\\" but despite this she \\"did enjoy life a lot\\", making reference to her love for her husband Ali (despite his flaws) and her babies as evidence of this. Kingsley's surmation of Sue stems around psychological problems however, with her suggesting that Sue was \\"always mentally unstable\\" and that she was never \\"that strong at the best of times\\". In her book Soapbox, Kingsley suggested that Sue, like many women in EastEnders, was \\"very much the power behind the throne. She virtually runs the cafe singlehanded. She fights with their [property] landlord, tells the customers (the other residents) the unvarnished truth about themselves and struggles to keep Ali from gambling away the profits.\\" Before the show aired, Holland and Smith had already decided that Sue and her husband would be parents to a young baby named Hassan. However, as further characters were invented they realised that there would be a total of four babies in the show: Annie Smith, Martin Fowler, Vicki Fowler and Hassan. It was decided that it would be impossible for the studios to cope with four babies, and so they invented a storyline to eliminate one of the young babies from the cast. During this time in the 1980s, the issue of cot death was prominent in the British press, partly due to an increase in casualties, but also because a doctor had gone public with the accusation that parents were to blame for the tragic occurrence. Holland and Smith decided that covering this issue in the soap would be a good way of 'setting the record straight', and so it was decided that Sue and Ali's baby would die from cot death in the early months of the show. This was the first of many controversial storylines in EastEnders' history. After the storyline aired in June 1985, the show was praised by audience and press alike for the sensitive and unsensational way this harrowing subject was treated. The sudden tragedy came as a surprise to the audience, especially since the bereaved parents were a couple whose feuding, fighting ways had made them appear rather comic in the early episodes of the show. The British Cot Death Foundation initially feared that a soap opera would trivialise the subject and frighten new parents. They tried to stop the episodes from airing, but in the end they were pleased with the way the subject was handled, and provided back-up support after transmission to many viewers who wanted more information on the subject. In 1987, after a long period of being shown trying to conceive, scriptwriters finally decided to make Sue pregnant in the soap opera with her second child. Sandy Ratcliff was positive about the storyline: \\"It's going to be the making of Sue and Ali. Neither of them has ever got over the death of Hassan but hopefully the new baby will fill the void in their life.\\" Discussing the ongoing storyline depicting marital problems with the Osmans, Nedjet Salih who played Ali said: \\"The marriage was going downhill. Ali is no angel, but he's had a lot to put up with and has been very tolerant about Sue's depressions. Sue hasn't been easy to live with, she's been such a misery. No wonder he's been looking at other women ... although to be honest it's all bravado. He'd get cold feet when it came to it. It's really only Sue he loves and wants.\\" According to Ratcliff, Sue getting pregnant put her in a dilemma because she worried that happiness for the Osmans would need to be curtailed if she decided to leave the programme; she felt this would be unfair on viewers because of all the misery Sue had been put through on-screen already. Discussing this in 1987, Ratcliff said, \\"I knew nothing about the baby plans until a few weeks ago when I came back from my holidays and was told that Sue was pregnant again. Sue has gone through enough in the last couple of years. I'm glad she's got her dearest wish [to have another baby]. I think she'll make a great mum and I'm sure Ali will be supportive. Hopefully, the storylines will open up for me, but it also means that if the pregnancy goes well and the baby is fine, it would be very difficult for me to leave without there being another tragedy in the Osman family. I don't think that would be fair on the show or the viewers.\\" Additionally, the turmoil that Sue had been through had led Ratcliff to consider quitting the serial prematurely. In 1987 she told the magazine Woman's Own, \\"[Sue]'s been such an unhappy woman since Hassan died. And it was beginning to rub off on me. I'd go to work, six days a week, be stuck in that grim little cafe and be permanently miserable. I got to the stage when I started to ask myself if I really wanted to spend all my working life playing a misery.\\" However, according to Ratcliff, the scriptwriters decision to make Sue pregnant changed her mind about leaving. She said, \\"Now Sue is pregnant and happy I feel differently about the role. So maybe it would be fun to stick around for a couple more years - if I'm wanted.\\" The character of Sue lasted in the show for four years, and many of her storylines resulted from the after-effects of the cot death plot, including the deterioration of her mental health. The actress was said to have been exposed to \\"horrific invasions of privacy\\" by the media during her tenure, in particular when it was revealed to the press in 1987 that she had spent time in prison for conspiracy to sell cannabis. At this time Ratcliff reportedly offered to leave the programme; however, producer Julia Smith stood by her and Ratcliff remained in the role of Sue for a further two years. Sue was eventually written out of the serial in 1989 following further off-screen personal problems of the actress who played her; Ratcliff admitted that she had been a heroin addict for eight years and was spending half her wages on drugs.\\"The Fall and Fall of an EastEnders Star: How Time Has Changed Sue Osman\\", The Daily Mirror. URL last accessed on 2006-09-14. On-screen, Sue's marriage to Ali broke down and she absconded with their baby, only to have a mental breakdown and be admitted to a psychiatric ward when Ali retrieved the child. Reception Hilary Kingsley has suggested that despite Sue's flaws, due to the skill of Sandy Ratcliff, \\"you can't help feeling sorry for her\\". She has added that \\"A lot of hearts were touched by Sandy Ratcliff when she played the tragic Sue Osman\\". Further, it has been suggested that \\"the tempestuous relationship between Sue and Ali Osman kept many an EastEnders viewer on the edge of their seat.\\" They couple were described as a diet coke version of the popular EastEnders couple, Den and Angie \\"running the caf√© rather than the Queen Vic\\". In 1988, Journalist for USA Today, Matt Roush, described Sue and Ali as two of the serial's more colourful residents. Discussing the cotdeath storyline, which aired in 1985 in the UK, Roush said, \\"When tragedy strikes, as in the case of Ali (Nejdet Salih) and jealous wife [Sue] (Sandy Ratcliff), EastEnders becomes achingly believable. Try to remember the last time you saw soap stars deal with the bureaucracy of registering death certificates and canceling welfare benefits.\\" Ratcliff has been critical of her character. In a 1987 interview she commented, \\"Sue really annoys me sometimes because she's got no guts. I'd love to liven her up a bit, dress her in some of Angie's clothes, get her out of that cafe, set her up in a business of her own and allow her to make something of her life.\\" Ratcliff was also critical that Sue was not more of a feminist: \\"I was under the impression she'd become more assertive. I had visions of a bunch of feminists walking into the cafe one day right in the middle of a typical Sue and Ali fight, and them asking her why she puts up with him. No doubt Sue would screw up her nose and ask: 'What do you mean?' But she'd think about it, want to hear more and gradually begin to change her ways to become stronger, more independent! I get cheesed off with Sue. She isn't me at all.\\" In 2011, an EastEnders' storyline aired featuring the character Ronnie Branning's baby dying of a cot death and the mother subsequently swapping her dead baby with another character's child. This plot has been compared unfavourably to the Osman cot death of 1985.

It was passed by the English Parliament but was extended to cover Scotland in 1708The Treason Act 1708 (c 21) and Ireland in 1821.The Treason (Ireland) Act 1821 (c 24) Some of it is still in force today. Provisions The Act provided that: * People accused of treason should have the right to be represented by up to two counsel. * Nobody could be convicted of treason except by the evidence of two witnesses to the same offence (but not necessarily the same overt act of the offence). (This rule, previously enacted in the Treason Act 1547, the Treason Act 1554 and the Sedition Act 1661, was inherited by the United States and incorporated into Article III, Section 3 of the United States Constitution, which added that both witnesses had to have witnessed the same overt act.) * Nobody could be prosecuted or punished for treason or misprision of treason unless the indictment was signed by the grand jury within three years of the crime being committed (except in cases of an attempt on the life of the King, or treason outside England and Wales). * A defendant should be allowed to have a copy of the indictment against him (at his own expense). * No evidence could be used against him except what was pleaded in the indictment. However the Act did not apply to forgery (some kinds of forgery were classed as high treason by the Treason Act 1351), or to petty treason.Hale's History of Pleas of the Crown (1800 ed.) vol. 1, chapter XXIX (from Google Books). History The Act was passed because previously the law had been extremely harsh, allowing little opportunity for a defendant to defend himself and enabling trumped-up charges of treason to succeed. By the 1680s even the notoriously severe Judge Jeffreys was prepared to admit that it was \\"hard\\" that the accused in a treason trial had no right to counsel. However between 1817 and 1998 the protection of the Act was removed from those accused of treason by assaulting the heir to the throne, or misprision of such treason.The Treason Act 1817 (57 Geo 3 c 6) section 4 (repealed by 1998 c 37). Today most of the Act has been repealed, but the three year time limit still survives (see below), and of course the rights to be represented and to have a copy of the indictment (now free of charge) still exist in other legislation. However the \\"two witnesses\\" rule no longer exists in the United Kingdom. In 1800 this rule, and all other special rules of evidence in treason cases, were abolished for cases of killing or attempting to kill the Sovereign. The Treason Act 1842 extended this exception still further, to all attempts to maim or wound the Sovereign (non-lethal assaults on the Sovereign were treason until 1998). Finally, in 1945, the special status of treason was removed for all kinds of treason, and ever since then the evidence required, and the procedure followed, in treason proceedings has been the same as in murder trials.The Treason Act 1945 (c 44) Repeals Sections 2 and 4 were repealed in part by the Statute Law Revision Act 1888. The Treason Act 1945 repealed the whole Act, except for sections 5 and 6. Section 5 was repealed in part by the Statute Law Revision Act 1948. The Act today The three year time limit described above ‚Äì and the original exception to it ‚Äì are still on the law books today, and are contained in sections 5 and 6 of the Act. (However grand juries were abolished in England in 1933, and now indictments need no longer be signed.The Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933, as amended by section 116 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009.) When in 2000 a British newspaper suggested that James Hewitt be prosecuted under the Treason Act 1351 for an alleged affair with Diana, Princess of Wales,BBC News, 31.8.2000 it was pointed out that the mooted evidence fell outside the time limit.

Of these structures, only a section of the latter survives. Andrey Vasilyevich Bolshoy, nicknamed Goryai () (14 August 1446 in Uglich ‚Äì 6 November 1493 in Moscow), was the third son of Vasili II of Russia who transformed his capital in Uglich into a major centre of political power and ensured the town's prosperity for two centuries to come. He was called Andrey Bolshoy (Big Andrew) to distinguish him from his younger brother Andrey Menshoy (Little Andrew). After the death of his father in 1462, Andrey Bolshoy inherited the cities of Uglich, Zvenigorod, and Bezhetsk. His relations with his older brother, Ivan III of Moscow, were cordial at first. It was ten years later that the death of their brother, the childless Yury of Dmitrov, led to bad blood between the two. Ivan III appropriated Yury's appanage for himself, rather than sharing it with his brothers. At last he granted some of Yury's lands to his other brothers, except Andrei Bolshoy, who had been coveting them more than others. Another conflict between the two brothers was triggered by the right of boyars to leave their own prince for the courts of other princes. Ivan III would only allow such practice if a boyar were to move to Moscow. In 1479, one displeased boyar, Prince Lyko-Obolensky, left the Moscow Kremlin and settled at the court of his brother Boris, ruler of Volokolamsk. When the latter refused to extradite the boyar, Ivan III ordered to capture Lyko-Obolensky and deliver him to Moscow in chains. Andrei Bolshoy took the side of the offended prince of Volokolamsk. The two brothers joined their armies and marched towards Novgorod and then to the Lithuanian border. There, they began to negotiate with the Polish king Kazimierz IV, who decided not to interfere in the conflict. Boris and Andrey then sought support in Pskov, but to no avail. In order to settle the conflict, Ivan III offered Andrei Bolshoy the cities of Kaluga and Aleksin, but he refused. The invasion of Khan Akhmat in 1480 reconciled the grand prince with his brothers. Ivan III became more tractable and promised to fulfill all their demands. Andrei and Boris moved their armies to the Ugra River and joined Ivan III in his stand-off with the Mongols. Their reconciliation was mediated by their mother, metropolitan and a number of bishops. As a token of their reconciliation, the grand prince granted Andrei the city of Mozhaisk, the most coveted part of Yury‚Äôs appanage. After the death of their mother Maria of Borovsk in 1484, Andrei‚Äôs situation became perilous because his defiant stance and groundless claims filled Ivan III with misgivings. He was afraid that, in line with the ancient system of Rurikid succession, Andrey would attempt to usurp the throne of Muscovy after his own death. In 1488, Andrey was informed about Ivan's plans to dethrone and imprison him. Upon his epistolary complaint to the grand prince, the latter protested his innocence. In 1491, Ivan III ordered Andrei and Boris to send their armies to help out his ally Me√±li I Giray. For reasons unknown, Andrei disobeyed the grand prince. When he came to Moscow in 1492, he was arrested and put in prison, where he died in 1493. Thereupon Andrey's sons ‚Äî Ivan and Dmitry ‚Äî were imprisoned in Vologda, while their appanage ‚Äî Uglich ‚Äî was annexed into Muscovy.

Additional purchases are under negotiation which will increase the size of the refuge to 1,800 acres (7.3 km2). More than 6,000 visitors per year visit the refuge. The facility is unstaffed, but is administered by the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge in Decatur, Alabama. Topography Key Cave NWR Two caves, Key Cave and Collier Cave, lie within the refuge, approximately apart. Both caves are closed to the public. Each is on the northern shore of Pickwick Lake on the Tennessee River. The area also contains several sinkholes and cave systems, including a sinkhole lake. The sinkholes and cave systems provide a source of groundwater for the caves. The refuge is set up to minimize the pollution of this groundwater. The land suffers from severe erosion due to the extensive farming in the area. A restoration of the land to native warm season grasses and mixed hardwoods is underway in order to protect the cave groundwater area. Approximately 338 acres (1.4 km2) of the land is used for corn and soybean production under a Cooperative Farm Agreement. Fields of warm season grasses such as big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), and eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides) cover 260 acres (1.1 km2) of land. of hardwood forest has been planted to help control the erosion. There are an additional of erosion drainages which are being converted to grassland or hedgerow habitat, being used as shallow water areas, and of hardwood forests consisting primarily of oak and hickory trees. History Map of Key Cave NWR The land of the Key Cave NWR area has historically been used for agricultural purposes, primarily in farming cotton. The area receives its name from William Key, who owned the land the refuge now contains as well as a plantation house on nearby private property. A slave cemetery called \\"Key Cemetery\\" is located on the refuge. In 1990, the Ozark Underground Laboratory tested the underground water table and determined that the area suffered from chemical pollution from nearby cotton, soybean, corn, and wheat farming operations. The Key Cave and Collier Cave share the same aquifer system which was being polluted as a result of the farming operations. In 1992, the Monsanto Company sold the land in the highest hazard risk area to The Conservation Fund. This land was later sold to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service which established the Key Cave NWR on January 3, 1997. Wildlife Alabama cavefish Key Cave is a critical habitat for the endangered Alabama cavefish (Speoplatyrhinus poulsoni). Only 130 specimens have been observed over the 36 excursions to Key Cave between 1967 and 1998. The refuge also provides protection for approximately 40,000 endangered gray bats (Myotis grisescens). The cave is also home to two species of endangered crayfish: Phantom cave crayfish (Procambarus pecki) and Cambarus jonesi. Key Cave NWR also manages several bird species including grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum), dickcissels (Spiza americana), northern harriers (Circus cyaneus), short-eared owls (Asio flammeus), loggerhead shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus), and northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus).

An exhibit in the Edinburgh Museum of Childhood Toy theater, also called paper theater and model theater (also spelt theatre, see spelling differences), is a form of miniature theater dating back to the early 19th century in Europe. Toy theaters were often printed on paperboard sheets and sold as kits at the concession stand of an opera house, playhouse, or vaudeville theater. Toy theatres were assembled at home and performed for family members and guests, sometimes with live musical accompaniment. Toy theatre saw a drastic decline in popularity with a shift towards realism on the European stage in the late 19th century, and again with the arrival of television after World War II.Bell, John. \\"A Short Entertaining History of Toy Theater.\\" Cambridge: Great Small Works, 2008. Toy theatre has seen a resurgence in recent years among many puppeteers, authors and filmmakers and there are numerous international toy theatre festivals throughout the Americas and Europe. History Tinsel print of the English actor John Thomas Haines in character as Brian de Bois-Guilbert in Ivanhoe, about 1830 Late 18th and early 19th century The original toy theatres were mass-produced replicas of popular plays, sold as kits that people assembled at home, including stage, scenery, characters and costumes. They were printed on paperboard, available at English playhouses and commercial libraries for \\"a penny plain or two pence coloured.\\" Hobbyists often went to great pains to not only hand-colour their stages but to embellish their toy theatre personae with bits of cloth and tinsel; tinsel print characters could be bought pre-tinselled, or a wide range of supplies for home tinselling could be bought. Just as the toy-sized stages diminished a play‚Äôs scale, their corresponding scripts tended to abridge the text, paring it down to key characters and lines for a shorter, less complicated presentation. In the first half of the 19th century, more than 300 of London‚Äôs most popular plays saw the issue as toy theatres. Publishers sent artists to the playhouses of Georgian and early-Victorian London to record the scenery, costumes and dramatic attitudes of the greatest successes of the day. The theatre management often provided these artists with a free seat, as the toy theatre sheets were excellent free advertising. Late 19th and early 20th century Stage theater of the early 19th century had been based more on spectacle than on depth of plot or character, and these characteristics lent themselves effectively to the format of toy theater. Toward the end of the 19th century, European popular drama had shifted its preference to the trend of Realism, marking a dramaturgical swing toward psychological complexity, character motivation and settings utilizing ordinary three-dimensional scenic elements. This trend in stage theater did not make an easy conversion to its toy counterpart, and with the fanciful dramas of 50 years prior being out of fashion, the toy theaters that remained in print fell into obsolescence. Despite its fall in popularity, toy theater remained in the realm of influential artists who championed its resurgence. In 1884 British author Robert Louis Stevenson wrote an essay in tribute of toy theater‚Äôs tiny grandeur entitled ‚ÄúPenny Plain, Twopence Coloured‚Äù in which he extolled the virtues of the dramas supplied by Pollock's. Benjamin Pollock's Toy Shop on the Spitalfields Life website - 17 December 2009The Rise and Fall of Toy Theatre - Craftsmanship Magazine - 6 December 2015 Other children‚Äôs authors like Lewis Carroll and Hans Christian Andersen also dabbled in toy theater, as did Oscar Wilde. The brothers Jack and William Butler Yeats both used toy theaters as mock-ups for their work in art and stagecraft. In the 20th century toy theater became a tool for the avant-garde, messed with by Futurist founder F.T. Marienetti as well as Pablo Picasso. Film directors like Ingmar Bergman and Orson Welles would use toy theaters as staging grounds for their cinematic masterpieces, and Laurence Olivier even made a toy theater of his film version of Hamlet, mass-produced with a little paper cutout of himself in the starring role. But after its second wave boom, toy theater fell into a second recession, replaced in the 1950s, by a different box in people‚Äôs sitting rooms that needed no live operator and whose sets, characters, stories and musical numbers were beamed in electronically from miles away to be projected on the glass of a cathode ray tube: television. Late 20th and early 21st century Ain√© Adriana Martelli performing Gen√≠ y el Zepelin at the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City Toy theater has been enjoying a revival in recent decades. Collectors and traditionalists perform restored versions of Victorian plays while experimental puppeteers push the form‚Äôs limits, adapting the works of Isaac Babel and Italo Calvino, as well as that of unsung storytellers, friends, neighbors, relatives, and themselves. Contemporary toy theater may utilize any available technology and cover any subject, and numerous international toy theater festivals occur regularly throughout the Americas and Europe, attracting many well-known actors, musicians and authors to their stages. Construction and format Mass-produced toy theaters are usually sold as printed sheets, either in black and white to be colored as desired, or as full-color images of the proscenium, scenery, sets, props and characters. The sheets are pasted onto thin cardboard, cut out, and then assembled for the purposes of the reenacting of a play. Figures are attached to small sticks, wires, or configurations of strings that allow them to move about the set. Some toy theaters and figures are enhanced with moving parts and special effects, and it is common for performances to include live or pre-recorded sound effects and music.

Construction of the bunker (designated by the Germans as DORA I) was undertaken during the Second World War. Nearby is the uncompleted Dora II (Dora 2). Trondheim was traditionally referred to as Drontheim in German, and the name DORA is the letter \\"D\\" in the German phonetic alphabet.  History =Background Following the occupation of Norway in 1940, it was soon realised that the country only had limited facilities for minor naval repairs. More extensive work usually meant a return to Germany. The capitulation of France two months later overshadowed the strategic importance of Norway to some extent, but it was still regarded as a better location for access to the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans than Germany. Nevertheless, better protection for U-boats from aerial attack was required so a bunker-building programme was instigated.Jak P Mallmann Showell Hitler's U-boat Bases (2002) Sutton Publishing p. 55 German U-boat bases in occupied Norway operated between 1940 and 1945, when the Kriegsmarine (German navy), converted several naval bases in Norway into submarine bases. Trondheim was an important U-boat base in Norway during the war. It was the home of the 13th U-boat Flotilla and it had 55 U-boats assigned to the flotilla during its service. Construction Construction of the bunker Three U-boats in a submarine pen at Trondheim, 19 May 1945 German type VII and IX U-boats at Trondheim after the war on 19 May 1945 Construction of the bunker which would become part of the largest German naval base in Northern Europe, started in the autumn of 1941, one year after the invasion of Norway. The concrete roof was thick and reinforced with steel. The walls were also concrete but these were thick. The whole bunker was . The work was undertaken by the Todt Organisation's (OT) Einsatzgruppe 'Wiking' and the Sager & W√∂rner construction company from Munich. The OT used slave labour extensively; five Serbian workers died when a wall fell on them. This incident fuelled a widespread rumor that the Germans simply left the bodies inside the wall. While German engineers did calculate that the five bodies would not weaken the fortification considerably, the bodies were removed before construction continued.NRK: Historien om Dora Difficulties with the labour force was not the only problem. The acquisition of raw materials was also a problem. Many Norwegian buildings were erected from timber so cement, sand and aggregate - components essential for the production of concrete - were often hard to extract in sufficient quantities. The steel required for reinforcing was mostly imported from Germany. The weather also played its part; roads and railways were often affected by snow and ice. Pre-fabricated accommodation units from Germany proved to be inadequate. More ships were delayed by the weather than enemy interference. Most construction machinery also had to be imported.Showell p.56 The bunkers in Norway were originally slated for a second floor to be built over the submarine pens. This was to house accommodation, workshops and offices. The idea was abandoned at the end of 1941 due to the problems already mentioned. The choice of site did not help either. Accumulated mud, on top of clay and sand layers proved to be incompatible with existing designs and was unstable ground so that the bunker had to be built in parts and stabilized before continuing construction.T√•ke reddet Trondheim fra katastrofen Construction of a smaller bunker just west of it, Dora II (Dora 2), was started in 1942, but it was only half-completed by the end of the war. This building is presently used by a shipyard. Plans for a Dora III (Dora 3) in Leangen Bay (Leangenbukta) was postponed and construction never started. In Service Dora I developed a noticeable sag of up to which seemed to concern the builders more than the U-boat sailors. It was finally handed over to the Kriegsmarine on 20 June 1943 as the home base of the 13th U-boat Flotilla.Showell p.58 The bunker, which could be hermetically sealed when attacked, had room for 16 U-boats. A number of U-boats surrendered in Trondheim at the end of the war on 9 May 1945. During the war Allied bombing raids targeted German submarine pens (bunkers). In July 1943 an American bombing raid was conducted against the German base at Trondheim. Workshops in the area were destroyed, there was large material damage including on civilian targets, and the German reports were that they were set back three months in their construction plans (loss of materials and other damage would have contributed to delays on building Dora II). Only light damage was ever reported on Dora I. A British bombing raid was attempted in November 1944, but because of low cloud cover/fog and smoke laying by the Germans the bombers turned back and did not bomb Trondheim. After World War II here After the war, Dora I was to be blown up using dynamite, but this project was eventually cancelled due to the massive construction and the sheer size of the bunker. Blowing it up would have caused serious damage to the surrounding buildings as well. In the summer of 1945 the Norwegian submarine force were transferred from Britain and Dora I was used by them until 1954, when they were moved to the submarine pens in Bergen. The base was used by the Norwegian Defence Forces; two extra stories, painted in blue, were added. Dora I was converted into a warehouse and workshop building. Today, the former naval base is the home of the city and state archives, a bowling alley and several other businesses. The submarine pens originally built for holding German U-boats are now being used as a harbour for civilian boats.  Gallery  Image:Dora1-FullFrontView.jpgFull front view of complex.

Scientists believe that Poecilozonites colonised the mid-Atlantic island of Bermuda at least 300,000 years ago. Poecilozonites makes up 95% of Bermuda's terrestrial fossils. Only one other large pulmonate, Succinea, has been found as a fossil. Research The major contributor to the natural history of Poecilozonites was Harvard paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould who did his doctorate and early academic research on Bermuda's snails. On December 21, 1999, Dr. Gould described to The Royal Gazette of first visiting Bermuda as a deckhand on a Woods Hole Research Center boat in 1959. \\"I was a geology major. I had a look around and found all these wonderful fossil snails in all their variety. The geology of Bermuda had already been worked out by then and I thought these snails would become a pretty good PhD.\\" Poecilozonites is a member of the Gastrodontidae family and is likely to have colonised Bermuda from North America as one specimen via flotsam. Gould cites research which uses the \\"probability of self-impregnation\\" as the justification of this view. Gould claims the proto-poecilozonites \\"underwent a vigorous and presumably rapid adaptive radiation\\" and diversified into three subgenera and 15 species, ranging in size from P. nelsoni (max dia. 46 mm) to the subspecies' of P. gastrelasmus and P. discozonites which were found to rarely exceed 5 mm. Although extinction of various species occurred in prehistoric times, with the introduction of predators by man in the 16th century, namely hogs, dogs, cats, and rats, the snail suffered, but has apparently hung on. It was the introduction of the predator snails Euglandina and Gonaxis in the 1950s and 1960s and the increased use of pesticides that led to the presumed extinction of the surviving Poecilozonites species by the 1970s. The apparently accidental introduction of the edible snail, Otala in the mid-1920s set the die for the destruction of Poecilozonites as by the 1950s, Otala had become a pest and measures were taken to control their numbers. By the time of Gould's research in the mid-1960s, P. bermudensis and P. circumfirmatus were still common. He wrote of talking to an elderly woman who remembered a time when the shells were collected and burned for lime. By the mid-1970s, a Bermuda Biological Station scientist remembers opening his kitchen door and seeing none other than Gould exclaim \\"If I could only find one alive!\\" In Eight Little Piggies, a book from 1993, Gould wrote: \\"I don't even think Euglandina has even dented Otala but it devastated the native Poecilozonites. I used to find them by the thousands throughout the Island. When I returned in 1973... I could not find a single animal alive. Last year (1991) I relocated one species, the smallest and most cryptic, but the large P. bermudensis, the major subject of my research, is probably extinct.\\" In 2002, a Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo summer intern, Alex Lines, was sent out to Gould's old sites and is understood to have found a clutch of survivors. Several dozen snails were sent to London to aid their propagation. Poecilozonites circumfirmatus is protected in Bermuda under the Protected Species Act (2003) and a Protected Species Recovery Plan was published for it in 2010 by the Bermuda Government, Department of Conservation Services. In 2014 it was reported in The Royal Gazette that a live colony of Poecilozonites bermudensi (greater Bermuda land snail) had been found in an overgrown alley in Hamilton. The colony was apparently isolated from the rest of the island, including the effects of invasive species, by colonizing the alley early on.https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-29790073 A captive breeding program was carried out at Chester Zoo and the Zoological Society of London in the UK, resulting in the release of more than 4,000 snails into nature reserves on the island by June 2019.

He developed a new style, which was informed by Flemish traditions, the 16th century Italian renaissance and possibly the School of Fontainebleau. His innovations spread throughout Northern Europe where they had a major influence on the development of sculpture and architecture in the 16th and early 17th centuries.Carl Van de Velde. \\"Cornelis Floris II.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 15 Jan. 2017 Life Cornelis Floris II was born around the year 1514 as the eldest of the four sons of Cornelis I and Margarete Goos. The earliest known ancestors of the Floris de Vriendt family, then still called only ‚Äòde Vriendt‚Äô, were residents of Brussels where they practiced the craft of stonemason and stonecutter which was passed on from father to son. One of Cornelis' ancestors became in 1406 a master of the Brussels stonemasons guild. A family member, Jan Florisz. (abbreviation of Floriszoon, meaning Floris‚Äôs son) de Vriendt, left his native Brussels and settled in Antwerp in the mid 15th century. His patronymic name ‚ÄòFloris‚Äô became the common family name of the subsequent generations. The original form ‚Äòde Vriendt‚Äô can, however, still be found in official documents until the late 16th century.Carl Van de Velde. \\"Floris.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 15 Jan. 2017 Tabernacle in the St. Leonard's Church, Zoutleeuw Little is known about his training. He probably worked in the workshop of his father who was a stonemason. He traveled abroad and was reportedly in Italy when his father died in 1538. He then returned to Antwerp to take care of his mother and younger brothers. In 1539, he became a master in the local Guild of Saint Luke.Biographical details at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He served as the dean of the Guild in 1547 and 1559. At around 1540, the guild register was embellished with grotesque initials which were signed by Cornelis. These grotesque motives, that were inspired by Italian contemporary models which in turn were based on archeological finds in Rome, would become an important characteristic of the Floris style and were used by him (as well as his brother Frans) in his other works.Rutger Tijs, Renaissance- en barokarchitectuur in Belgi√´‚Äô, Lannoo Uitgeverij, 1999 In 1550, Floris married Elisabeth Machiels and bought a house in Antwerp that he renovated in his own style. Cornelis Floris II died on 20 October 1575 after a rich career. At the beginning of his career, the renaissance was just starting to appear in the Netherlands. By the time, he died the new style was firmly established in the Netherlands. This was, however, not a simple copy of the Italian example as artists like Floris had imbued the style with homegrown sensibility. Cornelis' brothers also became excellent artists. The most famous one is Frans, who was one of the leading Flemish mannerist painters while Jacob was a painter of stained-glass windows and Jan was a potter. Cornelis had many pupils, a number of whom became established artists in their own right. They included Willem van den Blocke, Gert van Egen, Gillis de Witte, Philip Brandin, Robert Coppens, Heinrich Hagart, and Hieronymus van Kessel (I). Works Cornelis Floris was a versatile artist. He was mainly active as architect and sculptor, but also worked as an engraver. Sculpture Marble Rood Screen with stations of the cross, in Tournai Cathedral As a sculptor, he is principally known for his work on funeral monuments. In 1549, he received the commission for a funeral monument to be placed in K√∂nigsberg Cathedral for Dorothea, the wife of Albert, Duke in Prussia and daughter of the Danish king Frederick I.C. Osiecki, 'Rediscovered Cornelis Floris bust in The Pushkin Museum Moscow' This was the beginning of many commissions for sepulchral monuments for members of the Danish royal family. These included the tomb of Albert, Duke in Prussia in K√∂nigsberg Cathedral, the mausoleum of King Christian III of Denmark and the Cenotaph of Frederick I in Schleswig Cathedral. The monuments were typically made in marble with the statue of the deceased executed in alabaster. In his home country, he created in 1522 for the St. Leonard's Church in Zoutleeuw a stone tabernacle in the form of an 18-meter-high, nine-level tower. The tower made of white Avesnes stone was shipped in parts from Floris‚Äô workshop in Antwerp to the church. This work still incorporates gothic elements. He created another tabernacle for the St. Catherina Church in Zuurbeemde (now part of Glabbeek) in 1555-1557 which is in a pure renaissance style. He also made the rood screen for the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Tournai and the tomb monument of Jean II de M√©rode in the Saint Dymphna Church in Gheel. This sequence of major assignments points to a large workshop with a fair number of employees. Cornelis Floris acted mainly as an organizer and planner. His pupils and assistants travelled to the various locations (usually in Northern Europe) where the monuments designed by Floris were to be installed. Many of them remained to live and work in Northern Europe where they set up their own workshops. They relied on the Floris network to find their own commissions while often also continuing to assist with the execution of designs of Floris in their place of residence. Some of these artists, such as Willem van den Blocke and Gert van Egen, became artists working for the local court and were instrumental in the spread of the Floris style in Northern Europe.C. Osiecki, 'Forgotten Netherlandish Artists in the Baltic Region: the migration of Dutch and Flemish sculptors to the Baltic region in the second half of the sixteenth century', CODART eZine 2, Spring 2013 Architecture Antwerp city hall From the late 1550s, Cornelis Floris was additionally active as a designer of buildings. He is listed among others as architect of the Antwerp City Hall.Jan Lampo, Antwerp City Hall There are divergent views on the precise role of Cornelis Floris in the design of the building and its construction, as it was a collaborative effort which involved a great number of architects and sculptors including, amongst others, Willem van den Broeck, Hans Hendrik van Paesschen and Jan Daems. His contribution was not restricted to collaboration in the design. It is certain that he also had an important role in the practical execution. He visited quarries to choose stone and at that time maintained a large workshop in the Everdijstraat with a dozen assistants who were mainly busy with work related to the construction of the city hall. Their activity likely focused on the sculptures for the interior and the facade. The Antwerp City Hall became a figurehead for the new renaissance style in architecture in the Netherlands. The city halls of Vlissingen and The Hague in the Netherlands and the design of the city hall of Emden, the portico of the Cologne City Hall (1557) in Germany and the Green Gate in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland were inspired by this new style. Cornelis Floris also designed in Antwerp the Hanseatic League building and the town house of his brother Frans (1562‚Äì5). Both buildings no longer exist. Graphic art Floris collaborated with engraver and publisher Hieronymus Cock in the publishing of books with his designs for monuments and ornaments: the ‚Äò‚ÄôVeelderley niewe inuentien van antycksche sepultueren‚Äô‚Äô (‚ÄòThe many new designs of antique sculptures') was published in 1557 and the ‚Äò‚ÄôVeelderley veranderinghe van grotissen‚Äô‚Äô (‚ÄòMany varieties of grotesques‚Äô) in 1556. The publication of these books contributed to the spread of his style throughout the Netherlands.

It means having two RNA genomes per virion but giving rise to only one DNA copy in infected cells. The term is also used to refer to cells that are diploid, but have chromosomal translocations.  Overview  Retrovirions for example are considered pseudoploid ‚Äì they have two genomes within each capsid, but in general only one provirus is seen after infection with a single virion. Retrovirus particles contain two copies of the RNA genome held together by multiple regions of base pairing (strongest pairing at 5‚Äô ends) which is also called 70S complex (dimer of 35S genomes). This gives viruses evolutionary advantages such as the ability to survive extensive damage to their genomes, as at least parts of both genomes are used during the reverse transcription process. It also explains the high rates of genetic recombination in retroviruses. The retroviral genome is coated by a viral nucleocapsid protein that may function like a single stranded binding protein and therefore enhances processivity and facilitates template exchanges. The nucleocapsid first organizes RNA genomes within the virion and then facilitates reverse transcription within the infected cell.

Etymology  The genus name, meaning \\"simple finger\\" (Greek aploe + daktylos), refers to some rays of the pectoral fins having a simple form.Cuvier and Valenciennes, Histoire naturelle des poissons, vol. 8 (1831). \\"Nous donnons √† ce genre le nom d'aplodactyle, pour rappeler la forme simple de quelques-uns des rayons de la pectorale, et √† l'esp√®ce celui D'Aplodactyle ponctu√©. (Aplodactylus punctatus, nob.)\\" An emendation to Haplodactylus (\\"single finger\\", from Greek haploos) by Agassiz has been ruled as being unjustified. Species The five currently recognized species in this genus are: * Aplodactylus arctidens J. Richardson, 1839 (marblefish) * Aplodactylus etheridgii (J. D. Ogilby, 1889) (notchheaded marblefish) * Aplodactylus lophodon G√ºnther, 1859 (rock cale) * Aplodactylus punctatus Valenciennes, 1832 * Aplodactylus westralis B. C.

USA =Classification by axle configuration There are several types of dolly bogie: * Full trailer - 2 axle (4 wheels), with a draw bar which also controls the trailer's front axle steering. The draw bar does not take load of the full trailer. Heavy full trailer needs to have its own brakes remotely controlled by the prime mover vehicle. * Semi-trailer - 1 axle (2 wheels), without the front axle but have a landing gear. Large semi-trailer of truck size is designed for connection via the fifth wheel on the tractor unit or the semi-trailer truck. Small semi-trailer such as travel trailer and boat trailer is design for connection via a tow hitch of a passenger vehicle. Either the fifth wheel or the tow hitch takes up to half the load of the semi- trailer. * Road train - special large dolly bogie equipped with a fifth wheel for further connection by the gooseneck type drawbar of another similar dolly and form a road train. The last dolly in a road train needs its own rear lights, brakes remotely controlled by the prime mover vehicle, and registration plate. * Tow dolly - a semi-trailer designed as automobile rescue equipment. It is designed to couple to the concerned automobile's powered wheel, i.e. the front wheel of a Front-wheel drive automobile, or the rear wheel of a rear-wheel drive automobile, by locking the powered wheels onto the tow dolly's tray. The tow dolly is tow hitch connected to a tractor or truck. Tow dollies are legal in all 50 US states and Canada. In the U.S. and Canada brakes are required on any loaded car tow dolly. Classification by coupling configuration There are two basic types: * Converter dolly, equipped with between one and three axles and designed to connect to a towbar on the rear of the truck or trailer in front. There are two variants of this: ** A A-dolly has a single drawbar with a centred coupling. ** A C-dolly has two separate couplings side-by-side. * Low loader dolly, equipped with a gooseneck type drawbar that attaches to the fifth wheel coupling on the rear of a prime mover to distribute the mass on the fifth wheel on the dolly between the prime mover and the wheels of the dolly. These are predominantly fitted with two axles. Australia Converter dollies are used in road trains in Australia, most commonly with two or three axles and a hinged drawbar. They are also frequently referred to as road train dollies. The C-dolly design is not allowed in Australia, as it prevents articulation between the dolly wheels and the axles of the truck or trailer in front of the dolly. Australian rules require articulation between axle groups. Low-loader dollies- which present a kingpin rather than a drawbar coupling- are used with many low loaders to allow heavy cargo to be carried without overloading the wheels of the prime mover or the low loader.

It encompasses , and as of the end of 2005, had 2,994 interments. It is operated and maintained by the Baltimore National Cemetery. History Annapolis National Cemetery is one of the 14 national cemeteries established by Abraham Lincoln in 1862 to accommodate the dead from the American Civil War. The original plot of land was leased, and later purchased, from Judge Nicholas Brewer. During the Civil War, Annapolis was a Union recruit training center. There was also a parole camp nearby (approximately three miles from what was then the city line) where Union prisoners who had been exchanged for Confederate prisoners were held until they could be returned to their own units. The conditions in the camp were crowded and were not particularly sanitary; many soldiers wound up in one of the army field hospitals at the U.S. Naval Academy and at St. John's College in downtown Annapolis. A large number succumbed to wounds they bore when they arrived, small pox, typhoid fever, dysentery or any of a number of other diseases. Most of the original interments were men who died in the parole camp or the field hospitals. Several Confederate prisoners, and one Russian national, also died in Annapolis and are buried in the cemetery. Many soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen who served during, or died in, subsequent wars - as well as some of their dependents - are also interred there. Annapolis National Cemetery was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Notable monuments There are no monuments at Annapolis National Cemetery. There are only individual gravesite markers. Notable interments *Charles Edward Kirby, Jr., Private First Class, 24th Infantry, 25th Infantry Division.

It was passed early in the reign of Queen Victoria. It was last used in 1981 to prosecute Marcus Sarjeant. Background On 29 May 1842, Victoria was riding in a carriage along The Mall, London, when John Francis, described by Victoria's husband Prince Albert as a \\"little, swarthy, ill-looking rascal ... of the age of twenty-six to thirty, with a shabby hat and of dirty appearance\\",Hibbert, p. 422 aimed a pistol at her but did not fire. The following day, Victoria drove the same route, though faster and with a greater escort, in a deliberate attempt to provoke Francis to take a second aim and catch him in the act. As expected, Francis shot at her, but he was seized by plain clothes policemen, tried, and convicted of high treason. Francis's death sentence was commuted to transportation for life on 1 July. Two days later, in a similar attack, John William Bean fired a pistol at the Queen, but it was loaded only with paper and tobacco.Hibbert, pp. 422‚Äì423; St Aubyn, pp. 162‚Äì163 Edward Oxford, who had shot at Victoria in 1840, felt that the attempts were encouraged by his acquittal on the grounds of insanity two years before.Hibbert, p. 423; St Aubyn, p. 163 Bean's assault, though physically harmless, was still punishable by death. Feeling that such a penalty was too harsh, Albert encouraged Parliament to pass a law recognising lesser crimes against the monarch, such as intent to alarm.St Aubyn, p. 163 Bean was sentenced to 18 months in jail.Hibbert, p. 423 Section 1 In 19th century Britain, treason had its own special rules of evidence and procedure, which made it difficult to prosecute traitors successfully, such as the requirement that the prosecution produce two witnesses to the same overt act, or that three judges preside at the trial. (See Treason Act 1695 for details.) The Treason Act 1800 relaxed these rules in relation to attempts on the King's life, bringing the rules in such cases in line with the less restrictive rules which then existed in ordinary murder cases. Section 1 of the 1842 Act went further, removing the special rules in all cases of treason involving any attempt to wound or maim the Queen. This section was repealed on 15 June 1945 by the Treason Act 1945.Section 2(1) and the Schedule. This repeal was consequential on the extension of the ordinary rules of evidence and procedure to all forms of treason by section 1 of that Act. Section 2 This section is still in force. It created a new offence (less serious than treason) of assaulting the Queen, or of having a firearm or offensive weapon in her presence with intent to injure or alarm her or to cause a breach of the peace. In 1981, Marcus Sarjeant was sentenced to five years on pleading guilty to firing blank shots at the Queen when she was on parade. Sentence A person convicted of an offence under this section is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years.The Treason Act 1842, section 2; the Penal Servitude Act 1857, section 2; the Criminal Justice Act 1948, section 1(1); the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1953, section 1(1); the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975, section 221(1) An attempt to assault or alarm the monarch was made punishable by flogging and up to seven years' imprisonment. No-one who violated the act was ever flogged.Poole, pp. 199‚Äì203 Relevant cases :R v. Francis (1842) 4 State Tr N.S. 1376 :R v. Bean (1842) 4 State Tr N.S. 1382 :R v. Hamilton (1849) 7 State Tr N.S. 1130 :Pate's Case (1850) 8 State Tr N.S. 1 Section 3 This section is also still in force, and provides that section 2 does not affect the penalty for treason. However, although under the Treason Act 1795 many kinds of assault on the Queen were treason, that Act was repealed in 1998. Under the present law, in Great Britain it is now only treason to \\"compass or imagine\\" the Queen's death. Consequently, assaulting the Queen is only treason if it proves that state of mind. In Northern Ireland intending or causing \\"any bodily harm\\" to the Queen remains treason under the Treason Act (Ireland) 1537.

Parable of the Grain of Wheat (Greek: ·ΩÅ Œ∫œåŒ∫Œ∫ŒøœÇ œÑŒø·ø¶ œÉ·øëÃÅœÑŒøœÖ; ho k√≥kkos to√ª sƒ´ÃÅtou) is an allegory on resurrection, sacrifice, and ego death, given by Jesus in the New Testament (The Gospel of John).  Narrative  From John 12:24-26 (KJV) > Verily, verily, I say unto you, –µxcept a corn of wheat fall into the ground > and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He > that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this > world shall keep it unto life eternal. If any man serve me, let him follow > me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him > will my Father honour. From the NIV: > Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and > dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. > Anyone who loves their life will lose it, while anyone who hates their life > in this world will keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves me must follow > me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honour the one > who serves me.  Interpretation  Jesus drew this parable about resurrection and the kingdom of God from the everyday circumstances of life. His rural audience could easily understand the principle of \\"resurrection\\" produced by dead seeds sown into the earth.The Parables of Jesus: The Grain of Wheat Jesus uses the metaphor of the grain of wheat to illustrate the importance of ego death in the pursuit of salvation and entering the Kingdom of Heaven. He is suggesting that one must first allow their current convictions and ideas about the world to die and be shed, before they can be reborn with a purer, more virtuous self that is stronger than the original. The image of the grain of wheat dying in the earth in order to grow and bear a harvest can be seen also as a metaphor of Jesus' own death and burial in the tomb and his resurrection. The Rev. William D. Oldland in his sermon \\"Unless a Grain of Wheat Falls into the Earth and Dies\\" said: The Apostle Paul also says: \\"What is sown in the earth is subject to decay, what rises is incorruptible\\" (1 Cor. 15:42).

It is located along Jackson Square, adjacent to St. Louis Cathedral.  History  The original Cabildo was destroyed in the Great New Orleans Fire (1788). The Cabildo was rebuilt between 1795‚Äì99 as the home of the Spanish municipal government in New Orleans, in 1821 Spanish coat of arms removed from the fa√ßade pediment and replaced with the extant American eagle with cannonballs by the Italian sculptor Pietro Cardelli and the third floor with mansard roof was later added in 1847, in French style.

The Cabildo was the site of the Louisiana Purchase transfer ceremonies late in 1803, and continued to be used by the New Orleans city council until the mid-1850s. The building's main hall, the Sala Capitular (\\"Meeting Room\\"), was originally utilized as a courtroom. The Spanish used the courtroom from 1799 to 1803, and from 1803 to 1812 it was used by the Louisiana territorial superior court. During the years between 1868 and 1910, the Cabildo was the seat of the Louisiana Supreme Court.History of the Louisiana Supreme Court, retrieved on 16 April 2017. The Sala Capitular was the site of several landmark court cases, including Plessy v. Ferguson. In 1895 the building was in a state of decay and proposed for demolition; artist William Woodward led a successful campaign to have the historic building preserved and restored. In 1911 (the state's highest court having vacated), the Cabildo became the home of the Louisiana State Museum. The museum displays exhibits about the history of Louisiana from its settlement up through the Reconstruction Era, and about the heritage of the ethnic groups who have lived in the state.

It was drafted by Peter W. Galbraith, Leonid Kerestedjiants and Geert-Hinrich Ahrens on behalf of a mini- Contact Group comprising United Nations envoys and diplomats from the United States, Russia and the European Union. The co-chairs of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, were closely involved in the political process surrounding the plan. The document was prepared in the final months of 1994 and early 1995 before being presented to Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman and the leaders of the self-declared Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) on 30 January 1995. Tuƒëman was displeased with the proposal, but accepted it as a basis for further negotiations. However, the RSK authorities even refused to receive the document before UNPROFOR mandate status was resolved. According to later reactions, RSK leadership was not satisfied with the plan. Three more attempts to revive the plan were made after Operation Flash in early May, when Croatia captured a portion of western Slavonia previously controlled by the RSK. The first initiative, that began later that month, failed because the RSK demanded that the Croatian forces pull back from western Slavonia (which Croatia declined to do). The second attempt failed simply because neither party wanted to negotiate. The final round of negotiations where the Z-4 Plan was proposed by international diplomats occurred in early August, when a major Croatian attack against the RSK seemed imminent. This time RSK leadership seemed more willing to negotiate based on Z-4 plan, but Croatia presented its own demands (including immediate replacement of the RSK with a Croatian civilian government), which were refused. On 4 August Croatia launched Operation Storm, defeated the RSK and effectively ended the political process which led to the creation of the Z-4 Plan. Elements of the plan made their way into two proposals on resolving the Kosovo crisis: in 1999 (during the Kosovo War) and in 2005 as a part of the Kosovo status process. Neither was accepted by the parties to that conflict. Background In August 1990 an insurgency known as the Log Revolution took place in Croatia, centred on the predominantly Serb- populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around the city of Knin, parts of the Lika, Kordun, and Banovina regions, and settlements in eastern Croatia with significant Serb populations. These areas were subsequently named the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) and, after the RSK declared its intention to unite with Serbia, the Government of Croatia declared the RSK a breakaway state. By March 1991 the conflict escalated, resulting in the Croatian War of Independence. In June 1991, Croatia declared its independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated. A three-month moratorium on Croatia and the RSK's declarations followed, after which their decisions were implemented on 8 October. Since the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) increasingly supported the RSK and the Croatian Police were unable to cope with the situation, the Croatian National Guard (ZNG) was formed in May 1991. The ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army (HV) in November. The establishment of the Croatian military was hampered by a September UN arms embargo. The final months of 1991 saw JNA advances and the fiercest fighting of the war, culminating in the Siege of Dubrovnik and the Battle of Vukovar. In November a ceasefire was negotiated pending a political settlement (which became known as the Vance plan), and it was implemented in early January 1992. The ceasefire collapsed in January 1993 when the HV launched Operation Maslenica, and small-scale clashes continued for more than a year. On 16 March 1994, Russian envoy Vitaly Churkin brokered negotiations between Croatia and the RSK which produced a new ceasefire on 30 March. Further negotiations produced agreements on reopening a section of the Zagreb‚ÄìBelgrade motorway (crossing the RSK-held part of western Slavonia, the Adria oil pipeline and several water-supply lines) by the end of 1994. Development=Creation The Z-4 Plan was drafted by United States ambassador to Croatia Peter W. Galbraith, Russian ambassador to Croatia Leonid Kerestedjiants and German diplomat Geert-Hinrich Ahrens, representing the European Union (EU) in a \\"mini-Contact Group\\". The Z in the plan's name stood for Zagreb (Croatia's capital), and 4 represented the involvement of the United States, Russia, the EU and the UN. The plan was the product of a process begun on 23 March 1994, with Galbraith considering himself its principal author. It was a well-developed legal document intended as the basis for negotiations and, according to Ahrens, designed to commit Croatia to an internationally agreed settlement and prevent it from turning to a military resolution of the war (while being generous to the Croatian Serbs). According to Ahrens, the plan was actually too generous to the Serbs; in essence, it created the legal foundation for a permanent Serb state in Croatia. The heart of the plan was the Constitutional Agreement on Krajina (Part One). Part One defined Krajina as an autonomous region of Croatia, with borders based on the results of the 1991 Croatian census (which identified eleven municipalities with an absolute Serb majority). Those areas would enjoy a high level of autonomy, with most authority transferred from the central government in Zagreb to Krajina. The region would have its own president, cabinet, legislation, courts, police force, emblem, flag and currency, and the right to levy taxes and make international agreements. Part One also provided for demilitarising the autonomous area. Part Two of the plan, the Agreements Concerning Slavonia, Southern Baranja, Western Sirmium and Other Areas, related to areas where the Croatian Serbs did not form the majority in 1991 (including eastern and western Slavonia) and contained transitional provisions. Part Three of the plan spelled out safeguards on human rights, fundamental freedoms, prosecution of war crimes, a human-rights court with international judges, and provisions allowing dual Croatian and Yugoslav citizenship for Croatian Serbs. The plan envisaged that western Slavonia would be the first to be restored to Croatian control, followed by eastern Slavonia (where a transitional UN administration would be set up before the handover). Proposed changes The first draft of the Z-4 Plan was prepared in September 1994, and further developed and amended on several occasions during the following four months. Over this period, International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia (ICFY) co-chairs David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg requested amendments to the plan and opposed its presentation to Croatian or RSK authorities. The first set of changes requested was to include a provision that Croatia cede territory around the city of ≈Ωupanja (on the north bank of the Sava River) to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, allowing better communication between Belgrade and the Bosnian Serb territory around Banja Luka. The request, submitted on 8 September, was turned down by the plan authors. That day, Owen requested that the plan allow Krajina to form a confederation with either Serbia or FR Yugoslavia. Owen and Stoltenberg sought to create a network of confederations between the former Yugoslav republics, but the authors of the Z-4 Plan deemed that impossible. German foreign minister Klaus Kinkel, on behalf of the German EU presidency, cautioned Owen that Krajina Serbs formed only 5 percent of Croatia's population and a confederation between Kosovo and Albania would be more natural. On 6 October Russia declared its opposition to the confederation, but Owen regained the country's support for the idea four days later (shortly before it was abandoned). The third group of requested amendments pertained to eastern Slavonia. Owen and Stoltenberg requested its status to be left unresolved, instead of gradually reverting to Croatian control over a five-year period and applying the postwar ethnic composition of the area as a formula for the ethnic mix of the local police and establishing a joint Croatian-Yugoslav company to extract crude oil in ƒêeletovci. The proposal was turned down, but it led to local autonomy for Serb villages in the area and reduced the transitional period to two years. The fourth group of proposed amendments, tabled by Owen, included a proposal for continued Serb armed presence in Krajina and additional authority for Krajina concerning mineral resources and international treaties. After the proposals, the text of the plan became the subject of lengthy discussions between the contact group countries, the EU and the ICFY co-chairs. The co-chairs began drafting their version of the plan; Stoltenberg stalled the plan through Norwegian diplomat (and ICFY ambassador) Kai Eide, creating a conflict between Eide and Galbraith. First news of the plan On 1 October, Galbraith informed Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman of the plan without providing any details. Similarly, Ahrens and Eide informed RSK president Milan Martiƒá. Although early Z-4 Plan negotiations were planned without actually disclosing the plan to Croatia and the RSK, elements of the plan were leaked to Belgrade and Zagreb newspapers in mid-October. According to Florence Hartmann, in October representatives of Tuƒëman and those of Serbian president Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá met in Graz, Austria to discuss the proposed reintegration of the RSK into Croatia and their opposition to the Z-4 Plan. Tuƒëman disliked the plan because it envisaged a Serb state in Croatia, while Milo≈°eviƒá saw it as a dangerous precedent that could be applied to majority non-Serb or ethnically-mixed regions of rump Yugoslavia, such as Kosovo, Vojvodina and the Sand≈æak. Galbraith, Eide and Kerestedjiants agreed to deliver the plan to Croatia and the RSK on 21 October, opposed by Owen and Stoltenberg. Owen also asked Vitaly Churkin to instruct his envoy to oppose the delivery. As instructed by Moscow, Kerestedjiants pulled out of the move and Galbraith accused Owen of sabotaging the Z-4 Plan. Final version The 53-page final version of the Z-4 Plan was prepared on 18 January 1995. Entitled \\"Draft Agreement on the Krajina, Slavonia, Southern Baranja and Western Sirmium\\", it consisted of three documents and two provisional maps. The maps were considered provisional because of concerns that the inclusion of Benkovac in Krajina would be contested by Croatia; a portion of the municipality had been predominantly inhabited by Croats, and it was on the Adriatic coast. Another territorial issue was the municipality of Slunj; it was not included in Krajina, and the omission effectively cut Krajina in two. A possible solution to the problem was to split the municipality in two and award the areas east of Slunj to Krajina. In anticipation of this, planning began for a road bypassing Slunj. Despite the unresolved issues, delivery of the plan to Croatia and the RSK was scheduled for January. On 12 January, shortly before the plan's final version was drafted, Tuƒëman announced in a letter to the UN that Croatia would not grant an extension of the UN peacekeeping mandate beyond 31 March and United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) troops deployed to the RSK would have to leave. Presentation On 30 January the Z-4 Plan was presented to Tuƒëman by the French ambassador to Croatia, accompanied by Galbraith, Kerestedjiants, Ahrens and Italian ambassador Alfredo Matacotta (replacing Eide). Tuƒëman did not hide his displeasure with the plan, receiving the draft with the knowledge that Milo≈°eviƒá's opposition to the plan (because of his concerns for Kosovo) would not allow it to be implemented. Tuƒëman accepted the plan (which Croatia considered unacceptable) as a base for negotiations with the RSK, hoping that they would dismiss it. The five diplomats then travelled to Knin to present the Z-4 Plan to the RSK leadership. There they met with Martiƒá, RSK prime minister Borislav Mikeliƒá and foreign minister Milan Babiƒá. Martiƒá refused to receive the draft before the UN Security Council issued a written statement extending the UNPROFOR mandate to protect the RSK. Kerestedjiants and Ahrens suggested that Martiƒá should acknowledge receipt of the plan and then say that the RSK would not negotiate before the UNPROFOR issue was resolved, but he refused. The diplomats then attempted to meet Milo≈°eviƒá in Belgrade about the matter, but Milo≈°eviƒá refused to see them and the group returned to Zagreb the next day. Ahrens described the events of 30 January as \\"a fiasco\\". Reactions Ahrens noted that Croatia and the RSK were satisfied with the outcome. Owen and Stoltenberg expressed their understanding of the RSK's and Milo≈°eviƒá's rejection of the plan, provoking a sharp reaction from Galbraith. The RSK parliament convened on 8 February with the Z-4 Plan as the sole item on the agenda. In their speeches there, Martiƒá, Mikeliƒá and Babiƒá described the plan as provocative to the RSK and saw Milo≈°eviƒá's support in refusing the plan as greatly encouraging. A number of other influential Serbian politicians rejected the plan in addition to Milo≈°eviƒá, including Borisav Joviƒá‚Äîa close ally of Milo≈°eviƒá, who considered the RSK strong enough militarily to resist Croatia‚Äîand Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj, who considered the plan totally unacceptable. The opposition politicians in Serbia were split. Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá said that since the RSK refused the plan Serbia should not accept it either, while Vuk Dra≈°koviƒá favoured the plan as an historic opportunity. Dra≈°koviƒá's views ultimately prevailed in the Serbian media, but not before late August. The only official reaction from Croatia was from its chief negotiator, Hrvoje ≈†ariniƒá. ≈†ariniƒá said that Croatia endorsed the restoration of Croatian rule, the return of refugees and local self-government for Croatian Serbs, but dismissed plan solutions incompatible with the Constitution of Croatia. In Croatia, the plan and its authors (especially Galbraith) were strongly criticised in what Ahrens described as a \\"vicious campaign\\". Attempts of reintroduction=May and June 1995 There were several more attempts to advocate the Z-4 Plan as the basis of a political settlement of the Croatian War of Independence. After Croatia captured western Slavonia from the RSK in Operation Flash in early May, Owen and Stoltenberg invited Croatian and RSK officials to Geneva in an effort to revive the plan. The initiative was endorsed by the UN Security Council and the G7, which was preparing its summit in Halifax at the time. The meeting was attended by Owen, Stoltenberg, Galbraith, Kerestedjiants, Eide and Ahrens as the international diplomats; the RSK was represented by Martiƒá, Mikeliƒá and Babiƒá, and the Croatian delegation was led by ≈†ariniƒá. ≈†ariniƒá accepted the invitation, claiming that the venue was a Croatian concession because Croatian authorities considered the issue an internal matter which should normally be dealt with in Croatia. On the other hand, the RSK delegation insisted on Croatian withdrawal from the territory captured earlier that month before negotiations could proceed. Since no such withdrawal was requested by the UN Security Council, Croatia rejected the demand and the initiative collapsed. A second attempt to revive the plan arose from talks between Kinkel and French foreign minister Herv√© de Charette on 28 June. They proposed establishing zones of separation to enforce a ceasefire, monitoring the RSK's external borders, specific guarantees for the safety of Croatian Serbs and implementating confidence-building measures by economic cooperation between Croatia and the RSK. The initiative, however, did not gain ground when the RSK refused to negotiate. August 1995 Another effort involving the plan came about after Milo≈°eviƒá asked the United States to stop an imminent Croatian attack against the RSK on 30 July. Although in his request he indicated that negotiations should be held based on the Z-4 Plan, he refused to meet Galbraith (who wanted Milo≈°eviƒá to pressure the RSK into accepting it) on 2 August. Instead, Galbraith met Babiƒá in Belgrade in an effort to persuade him to accept the plan. He told Babiƒá that the RSK could not expect international sympathy because of its involvement in the Siege of Bihaƒá, and they would have to accept Croatian terms to avoid war. As an alternative, Galbraith advised Babiƒá to accept negotiations based on the Z-4 Plan. Babiƒá complied, and Stoltenberg invited Croatian and RSK delegations to talks on 3 August. Genthod, near Geneva, was selected as the location to avoid media attention. The RSK delegation was headed by Major General Mile Novakoviƒá of the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina and the Croatian delegation was headed by Tuƒëman's advisor, Iviƒá Pa≈°aliƒá. At the meeting the RSK insisted on the withdrawal of the HV from western Slavonia and the gradual implementation of a ceasefire, followed by economic cooperation before a political settlement was discussed. The Croatian delegation did not intend to negotiate, but to prepare diplomatically for a military resolution of the war. Stoltenberg proposed a seven-point compromise, including negotiations based on the Z-4 Plan, beginning on 10 August. The proposal was initially accepted by Babiƒá, who then expressed reservations about the Z-4 Plan as a political settlement when he was asked to publicly declare support for the Stoltenberg proposal (so the Novakoviƒá delegation would follow his lead). Pa≈°aliƒá then asked Novakoviƒá to accept Croatia's seven demands, including immediate replacement of the RSK with a Croatian civilian government. Novakoviƒá refused Pa≈°aliƒá's proposal, indicating that he accepted the Stoltenberg proposal instead, and Pa≈°aliƒá declared that the RSK had declined a Croatian offer to negotiate. Croatia did not consider Babiƒá powerful enough to secure support for an initiative from Martiƒá, and thus unable to commit the RSK to an agreement. This view was supported by Babiƒá himself, who told Galbraith during their 2 August meeting in Belgrade that Martiƒá would only obey Milo≈°eviƒá. On 4 August Croatia launched Operation Storm against the RSK and, according to Galbraith, effectively terminated the Z-4 Plan and its associated political process. One final attempt, organised by Babiƒá, was made to revive the Z-4 Plan on 16 August. This initiative called for negotiating each point of the plan and extending the autonomous areas to eastern Slavonia. However, Ahrens and Stoltenberg considered any talks between Croatia and the exiled, discredited leaders of the RSK impossible. When they consulted ≈†ariniƒá about the initiative, he dismissed any possibility of negotiation. September 1995 and beyond Following Croatian military success against the RSK during Operation Storm in August, and in Bosnia and Herzegovina against the Republika Srpska during Operation Mistral 2 in September, US President Bill Clinton announced a new peace initiative for Bosnia and Herzegovina. This initiative, which aimed to restore eastern Slavonia to Croatia, was based on Croatian sovereignty and the Z-4 Plan. Gailbraith sought to reconcile the plan with new circumstances in the field; an example was limited self-government for Croatian Serbs in eastern Slavonian municipalities where they comprised a majority of the 1991 population; after Croatia objected, the proposal was replaced with provisions from the Constitution of Croatia. By early October the process led to the Erdut Agreement, establishing a framework for restoring eastern Slavonia to Croatian rule. When the agreement was first implemented in 1996, there were concerns in Croatia that the process might result in \\"covert\\" implementation of the Z-4 Plan in eastern Slavonia and political autonomy for the region. The Z-4 Plan was again resurrected in 1999 as a template for the Rambouillet Agreement, a proposed peace treaty negotiated between FR Yugoslavia and ethnic Albanians living in Kosovo. In 2005, after the Kosovo War, Serbia and Montenegro attempted to resolve the Kosovo status process by tabling a peace plan offering broad autonomy for Kosovo. According to Dra≈°koviƒá, then foreign minister of Serbia and Montenegro, the plan was a \\"mirror image of the Z-4 Plan\\". That year an \\"RSK government-in-exile\\" was set up in Belgrade, demanding the revival of the Z-4 Plan in Croatia (a move condemned by Dra≈°koviƒá and Serbian President Boris Tadiƒá). The same idea was put forward in 2010 by a Serb refugee organisation led by Savo ≈†trbac.

History In 1685, during an annual visit to the Cape, Hendrik Adriaan van Rheede tot Drakenstein granted the grounds of Groot Constantia to Simon van der Stel the VOC Governor of the Cape of Good Hope. Van der Stel built the house and used the land to produce wine as well as other fruit and vegetables, and for cattle farming. Following Van der Stel's death in 1712 the estate was broken up and sold in three parts: Groot Constantia; Klein Constantia; and Bergvliet. In 1779 the portion of the estate including Van der Stel's Cape Dutch-style manor house was sold to the Cloete family, who planted extensive vineyards and extended and improved the mansion by commissioning the architect Louis Michel Thibault. The wine cellar was added by Cloete in 1791. The house remained in the possession of the Cloete family until 1885, during which period the estate became famous for its production of Constantia dessert wine. In 1885 Groot Constantia was purchased by the government of the Cape of Good Hope and was used as an experimental wine and agricultural estate.winepros.com.au Following a disastrous fire in 1925 the house was extensively restored. In the year 1925 the manor house completely burnt down. Funds were raised to reconstruct it to its original Cape Dutch splendour. In 1969 the manor house became part of the South African Cultural History Museum, and in 1993 the estate passed into the ownership of the Groot Constantia Trust. The exhibition in the house is managed by Iziko South African Museum, and is particularly focused on rural slavery and the life of slaves during the early Cape colonial period. Today, other estates have joined Groot Constantia to form the scenic Constantia wine route. These estates include Klein Constantia, Buitenverwachting, Constantia Uitsig, Steenberg, Constantia Glen, Eagles Nest and High Constantia. Wine production Groot Constantia is noted particularly for its production of high-quality red wines, including Shiraz, Merlot and blended red Gouverneurs Reserve. In 2003 the estate began production of a Constantia dessert wine, called Grand Constance, for the first time since the 1880s.  Popular culture  * A number of scenes for the 1955 movie Untamed was set at and within Groot Constantia after the protagonist discovers a diamond and returns to Cape Town to live in a stately mansion.

The acidity of urea phosphate allows Ca, Mg and P to co-exist in solution. Under less acidic conditions, there would be precipitation of Ca-Mg phosphates.

Early life McConkey grew up in Buffalo, New York, the son of Joe, a Buffalo police officer, and Jean McConkey (1936‚Äì2013). His father also worked side jobs and managed to pay for Phil and his sister, Debbie, to attend private schools. He attended Canisius High School, and during that time Canisius didn‚Äôt lose a football game during McConkey's last three seasons when they were one of the top teams in the state. He played both defensive back and wide receiver, earning local honors, but in his senior year in 1975 he still weighed only 140 pounds. He knew the only way he could attend college was on a scholarship, but he received no offers until he earned an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy. Navy Midshipmen McConkey played college football for the Navy Midshipmen, catching 56 passes for 1,028 yards, while also gaining 1,039 special teams return yards and scoring 13 touchdowns (10 receiving, two rushing and one punt return). In his senior season, McConkey helped lead the Midshipmen to a 9-3 record. In his last game for Navy in 1978, McConkey led Navy to a come-from-behind 23-16 win over Brigham Young University and star quarterback Jim McMahon in the inaugural Holiday Bowl and was named MVP. Pro football career McConkey had completed his mandatory five years in the U.S. Navy as an officer and helicopter pilot when he decided to try to play professional football even though he was already 27. He weighed barely 160 pounds and hadn‚Äôt played football in five years. The first person he approached was Steve Belichick, Navy's backfield coach and scout, who timed him at a speedy 4.4 seconds in the 40-yard dash. Belichick then contacted his son, Bill Belichick, who had just been elevated to defensive coordinator of the New York Giants under head coach Bill Parcells. McConkey was signed by the Giants as a 27-year-old rookie. He was the first Navy Midshipman to join the NFL after four full years of service since Roger Staubach in 1969. In his six NFL seasons, McConkey was used as a reserve receiver, and frequently returned punts and kickoffs on special teams. His best statistical season was 1985, when he caught 25 passes for 404 yards, returned 53 punts for 442 yards, and gained 234 yards returning kickoffs. After two seasons with the Giants, in 1986 he was released and signed with the Green Bay Packers. He played four games with the Packers in 1986, then was re-signed by the Giants for the season's last 12 games. In those 12 games, he caught 16 passes for 279 yards and one touchdown, plus he was a punt returner and kick returner. McConkey is best remembered for his performance in Super Bowl XXI after the Giants' 1986 season, which the Giants won 39-20 over the Denver Broncos. In the game, his 25-yard punt return set up a Giants field goal. On the team's next drive, his 44-yard reception on a flea flicker play gave the Giants a first down on Denver's one-yard line, setting up a touchdown on the next play. In the fourth quarter, McConkey caught a six-yard touchdown reception after the pass bounced off the fingertips of tight end Mark Bavaro. Overall, McConkey contributed 50 receiving yards, 25 punt return yards, and one touchdown in the Giants victory. He also caught a 28-yard touchdown pass in New York's divisional playoff win over the San Francisco 49ers a few weeks earlier. While running off the field during the celebration following the victory in Super Bowl XXI, McConkey spotted a handgun on the field. He picked up the weapon, which was subsequently taken by a security officer who in turn returned it to the police officer who was unaware it was missing. The officer had lost the weapon while struggling with a fan who had jumped onto the field. He played for the Giants for two more seasons as the team's primary punt returner and reserve wide receiver. His final NFL season was 1989 for both the San Diego Chargers and Arizona Cardinals. McConkey finished his six NFL seasons with a Super Bowl ring, 67 receptions for 1,113 yards and two touchdowns, 228 punt returns for 1,832 yards, and 69 kickoff returns for 1,324 yards in 84 games. Political life In 1990, McConkey ran for the United States House of Representatives for the 12th Congressional District of New Jersey, encompassing parts of Hunterdon, Mercer, Somerset, Morris and Warren counties. The seat was a heavily Republican district and was being vacated by incumbent Republican Rep. Jim Courter. In the Republican primary, McConkey was defeated by Dick Zimmer, who won the recently vacated seat in the November General Election. Zimmer received 37.7% of the vote to McConkey's 30.8%. Future congressman Rodney Frelinghuysen, the scion of a powerful political family, would finish third. There are no run-off elections in New Jersey. Electoral historyPersonal life McConkey is president of Academy Securities, a San Diego-based financial services firm, and he owns several other San Diego businesses. He also still participates in athletics, including Masters Track events. He is married to Erin McConkey and has a daughter, May. In 2013, he was inducted into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame.

History Friesoythe shares a diverse culture in Lower Saxony history. Many cultural influences of German, Anglo-Saxon, Dutch, East Frisian, Danish and Swedish culture are noticeable in the town and citizens. The town has a large following of Roman Catholicism and small percentages of Calvinism and Lutheranism. It was part of the Duchy of Oldenburg and also under rule to the French Empire in the 18th century.  Second World War  In April 1945, the town of Friesoythe was evacuated and then occupied by the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division, under General Christopher Vokes. Most of the town's population of 4,000 had moved out to the surrounding countryside on about April 11‚Äì12, 1945.The Friesoythe Amtsgericht, or District Court, was closed on April 11th. If the District Court ceased to function on April 11, 1945, the evacuation of the bulk of the civilian population probably took place between April 11th through April 12th 1945.

The town was defended by some 200 paratroopers of Battalion Raabe of the 7th German Parachute Division.War Diary, General Staff, 4th Canadian Armoured Division, 1 April 1945-30 April 1945. Appendix 38; dated April 14th, 1945. National Archives of Canada, Ottawa, ON, RG 24, vol. no. 13794. Intelligence report signed: E. Sirluck, Capt. These paratroopers repelled the first attack by the Lake Superior Regiment (Motor) on April 13. The Lake Superior Regiment suffered two dead and nineteen wounded. German casualties are not known. Vokes ordered the resumption of the attack the next day by The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's) commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Frederick E. Wigle. The attack went well, with the Argylls securing the town by 10:30 hours. However, at 08:30 a small number of German soldiers caught Wigle's tactical headquarters by surprise, killing Wigle and several other soldiers.Mark Zuehlke, On To Victory: The Canadian Liberation Of The Netherlands, p. 308 Lieutenant Alan Earp survived a bullet through the head.War Diary, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada, April 14, 1945, pp. 10-11. Ottawa, ON, Canada. National Archives of Canada, RG 24, v. 15,005. The same entry for April 14th, 1945, is also reprinted in Robert L. Fraser's Black Yesterdays; the Argylls‚Äôs War, p. 431. Interview with Alan Earp. Vokes ordered an immediate reprisal. \\"A first-rate officer of mine, for whom I had a special regard and affection, and in whom I had a particular professional interest because of his talent for command, was killed. Not merely killed, it was reported to me, but sniped in the back\\".All the published accounts relate that Col. Wigle was shot in the back. However, Dr. Doug Bryce, the Medical Officer of the Argylls, said that he was shot in the head. Dr. Bryce thought very highly of Wigle (\\"the most wonderful man I have ever met\\"). Interview with Dr. Bryce, May 11, 1998. According to Vokes, \\"I summoned my GSO1 . . 'Mac,' I roared at him, 'I'm going to raze that goddam town.'\\"Chris Vokes, Vokes: My Story, 194-195. A similar account of Vokes and his role in the destruction of Friesoythe is found in Tony Foster‚Äôs Meeting of Generals, 437. Units and soldiers of the Argylls had spontaneously begun burning buildings in Friesoythe as revenge for the death of their colonel,Robert L. Fraser, Black Yesterdays; the Argylls' War. See the section entitled \\"The Burning of Friesoythe?\\" on pp. 435‚Äì437. but Vokes later issued a direct order, and the town was systematically set on fire with flamethrowers mounted on Wasp Carriers. The rubble was used to reinforce district roads for the division's tanks.Tony Foster, Meeting of Generals, iUniverse, 2000, , p. 437. According to German estimates, 85% to 90% of the town was destroyed, making it one of the most devastated towns in Germany at the time. Vokes commented that he had \\"No feeling of remorse over the elimination of Friesoythe.\\" The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and the Lake Superior Regiment (Motor) were awarded the battle honour \\"Friesoythe\\".  21st century  Friesoythe has grown from a village to a small city and shares traditional and modern style buildings of German architecture, Bauhaus, Victorian style, Renaissance and Baroque style. Large multinational companies are settled giving the city a modern appearance and lively feeling. Hospital, schooling, bus and train service, health service are all available in the city centre. The city has good communication and infrastructure and many American Germans, Poles and Russians integrated into its population.

Outside Bulgaria, Kolarov is perhaps best known for his collaborations with Nikolo Kotzev and his solo album Day of wrath.  Biography  Nelko Kolarov was born in Varna. From 1981 until 1985 he was a member of the popular Bulgarian rock band Impuls, where he first got experience in writing and arranging songs. During this period, he also studied at the Bulgarian State Conservatory in Sofia, from which he graduated in 1985 with a major in orchestra conducting. After graduation he became the conductor of the Varna Philharmonic Orchestra. Kolarov has also conducted various performances for the Varna National Opera, such as Giacomo Puccini's Gianni Schicchi, Manuel De Falla's El Amor brujo and The Wizard of Oz. Nelko Kolarov focused primarily on composing musicals during 1989 - 1991, composing music for such musicals as The most wonderful wonder, Romantic people and Hey Poltergeist, say, all of which were performed at the Variete theater in Gabrovo. During 1996 and 1997, several songs composed by Nelko received prizes in various pop contests and festivals throughout Bulgaria. In 1999, Kolarov conducted The Sofia Strings for Nikolo Kotzev's rock opera Nostradamus, which was released in 2001. The rock opera also featured Glenn Hughes, Joe Lynn Turner and band members of Europe, among others. Kolarov's first solo album, Day of wrath (–î–µ–Ω –Ω–∞ –≥–Ω–µ–≤–∞ in Bulgarian), was also released in 2001, though it had primarily been recorded in 1998 and 1999 at the studio Metzoforte in Varna and at a studio of Chocho Vladovski. The album also features songs previously written for the musical Hey Poltergeist, say, such as Beyond boundary, I am guilty, Smile! and Sinful people. Kolarov spends most of his time in his own studio in Varna, while also performing live at the piano bar Royal Classic together with Asen Georgiev and other Bulgarian artists as special guests.

This word, which is foundational to the conceptual frameworks of the Indian religions, refers in Buddhism to the system of natural laws which constitute the natural order of things. Dharma is therefore reality as-it-is (yatha-bhuta). The teaching of Gautama Buddha constituting as it does a method by which people can come out of their condition of suffering (dukkha) involves developing an awareness of reality (see mindfulness). Buddhism thus seeks to address any disparity between a person's view of reality and the actual state of things. This is called developing Right or Correct View (Pali: samma ditthi). Seeing reality as-it-is thus an essential prerequisite to mental health and well- being according to Buddha's teaching. Buddhism addresses deeply philosophical questions regarding the nature of reality. One of the fundamental teachings is that all the constituent forms (sankharas) that make up the universe are transient (Pali: anicca), arising and passing away, and therefore without concrete identity or ownership (atta). This lack of enduring ownership or identity (anatta) of phenomena has important consequences for the possibility of liberation from the conditions which give rise to suffering. This is explained in the doctrine of interdependent origination. One of the most discussed themes in Buddhism is that of the emptiness (sunyata) of form (Pali: r≈´pa), an important corollary of the transient and conditioned nature of phenomena. Reality is seen, ultimately, in Buddhism as a form of 'projection', resulting from the fruition (vipaka) of karmic seeds (sankharas). The precise nature of this 'illusion' that is the phenomenal universe is debated among different schools. For example; * Some consider that the concept of the unreality of \\"reality\\" is confusing. They posit that, in Buddhism, the perceived reality is considered illusory not in the sense that reality is a fantasy or unreal, but that our perceptions and preconditions mislead us to believe that we are separate from the elements that we are made of. Reality, in Buddhist thought, would be described as the manifestation of karma. * Other schools of thought in Buddhism (e.g., Dzogchen), consider perceived reality literally unreal. As a prominent contemporary teacher puts it: \\"In a real sense, all the visions that we see in our lifetime are like a big dream [...]\\".Ch√∂gyal Namkhai Norbu Dream Yoga And The Practice Of Natural Light Edited and introduced by Michael Katz, Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, NY, , pp. 42, 46, 48, 96, 105. In this context, the term 'visions' denotes not only visual perceptions, but appearances perceived through all senses, including sounds, smells, tastes and tactile sensations, and operations on received mental objects. __TOC__ Reality in Buddhist sutras Buddhist sutras devote considerable space to the concept of reality, with each of two major doctrines --the Doctrine of Dependent Origination (pratitya-samutpada) and the Doctrine of Cause and Effect (karma and vipaka)--attempting to incorporate both the natural and the spiritual into its overall world view. Buddhist teachings continue to explore the nature of the world and our place in it. The Buddha promoted experience over theorizing. According to Karel Werner, > Experience is ... the path most elaborated in early Buddhism. The doctrine > on the other hand was kept low. The Buddha avoided doctrinal formulations > concerning the final reality as much as possible in order to prevent his > followers from resting content with minor achievements on the path in which > the absence of the final experience could be substituted by conceptual > understanding of the doctrine or by religious faith, a situation which > sometimes occurs, in both varieties, in the context of Hindu systems of > doctrine.Karel Werner, Mysticism and Indian Spirituality. In Karel Werner, > ed., The Yogi and the Mystic. Curzon Press, 1989, page 27. The Mahayana developed those statements he did make into an extensive, diverse set of sometimes contrasting descriptions of reality \\"as it really is.\\"See Henshall, Ron (2007), The Unborn and Emancipation from the Born, a master's thesis by a student of Peter Harvey. For example, in Tibetan Buddhism the Gelugpa draw a distinction between Svatantrika-Prasa·πÖgika in Madhyamika philosophy.Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 Pp 224-267 This distinction was most prominently promulgated by Je Tsongkhapa (1357‚Äì1419 CE), when he argued that this distinction can be found explicitly and implicitly within in the works of Nagarjuna, Chandrakirti, and Buddhapalita.Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 Pp 224-267 The Theravada school teaches that there is no universal personal god. The world as we know it does not have its origin in a primordial being such as Brahman or the Abrahamic God. What we see is only a product of transitory factors of existence, which depend functionally upon each other. The Buddha is said to have said: \\"The world exists because of causal actions, all things are produced by causal actions and all beings are governed and bound by causal actions. They are fixed like the rolling wheel of a cart, fixed by the pin of its axle shaft.\\" (Sutta-Nipata 654) The word 'illusion' is frequently associated with Buddhism and the nature of reality. Some interpretations of Buddhism teach that reality is a coin with two sides: the not-permanent characteristic or anicca and the \\"not-self characteristic\\" or anatta, referred to as \\"emptiness\\" in some Mahayana schools. Dzogchen, as the non-dual culmination of the Ancient School (a school with a few million followers out of a few hundred million Buddhists) of Mantrayana, resolves atman and anatman into the Mindstream Doctrine of Tapihritsa. The Buddha Shakyamuni is said to have taught the variously understood and interpreted concept of \\"not-self\\" in the Anatta-lakkhana Sutta. In this sutta, he lists the characteristics that we often associate with who we are, and found that these characteristics, ultimately, are not who we are because they are subject to change without control. He further illustrates the changing nature of our feelings, perceptions, and consciousness. We can look at the concepts of not- permanent and not-self in objective terms, for example by deconstructing the concept of an aggregated object such as a lotus and seeing that the flower is made up entirely of non-flower elements like soil, nutrients, photosynthetic energy, rain water and the effort of the entities that nourished and grew the flower. All of these factors, according to the Diamond Sutra, co-exist with each other to manifest what we call a 'flower'. In other words, there is no essence arisen from nothingness that is unique and personal to any being. In particular, there is neither a human soul that lives on beyond the death of the physical body nor one that is extinguished at death since, strictly speaking, there is nothing to extinguish. The relative reality (i.e., the illusory perceived reality) comes from our belief that we are separate from the rest of the things in the universe and, at times, at odds with the processes of nature and other beings. The ultimate or absolute reality, in some schools of Buddhist thought, shows that we are inter-connected with all things. The concept of non-discrimination expands on this by saying that, while a chair is different from a flower, they 'inter-are' because they are each made of non-flower and non-chair elements. Ultimately those elements are the same, so the distinction between chair and flower is one of quantity not of quality. The Diamond Sutra, a Mahayana scripture, has many passages that use the formula: A is not A, therefore A is called A. Reality and dreams in Dzogchen In Dzogchen, perceived reality is considered to be illusion. According to contemporary teacher Ch√∂gyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche, all appearances perceived during the whole life of an individual, through all senses, including sounds, smells, tastes and tactile sensations in their totality, are like a big dream. It is claimed that, on careful examination, the dream of life and regular nightly dreams are not very different, and that in their essential nature there is no difference between them. The non- essential difference between the dreaming state and ordinary waking experience is that the latter is more concrete and linked to attachment; the dreaming experience while sleeping is slightly detached. Also according to this teaching, there is a correspondence between the states of sleep and dream and our experiences when we die. After experiencing the intermediate state of bardo, an individual comes out of it, a new karmic illusion is created and another existence begins. This is how transmigration happens. According to Dzogchen teachings, the energy of an individual is essentially without form and free from duality. However, karmic traces contained in the individual's mindstream give rise to two kinds of forms: * forms that the individual experiences as his or her body, voice and mind * forms that the individual experiences as an external environment. What appears as a world of permanent external phenomena, is the energy of the individual him or herself. There is nothing completely external or separate from the individual. Everything that manifests in the individual's field of experience is a continuum. This is the 'Great Perfection' that is discovered in Dzogchen practice.The Crystal and The Way of Light. Sutra, Tantra and Dzogchen by Ch√∂gyal Namkhai Norbu. Compiled and Edited by John Shane, Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, NY, USA, 2000, , pp. 99, 101. It is possible to do yogic practice such as Dream Yoga and Yoga Nidra whilst dreaming, sleeping and in other bardo states of trance. In this way the yogi can have a very strong experience and with this comes understanding of the dream-like nature of daily life. This is also very relevant to diminishing attachments, because they are based on strong beliefs that life's perceptions such as objects are real and as a consequence: important. If one really understands what Buddha Shakyamuni meant when he said that everything is (relatively) unreal, then one can diminish attachments and tensions. The teacher advises that the realization that life is only a big dream can help us finally liberate ourselves from the chains of various emotions, different kinds of attachment and the chains of ego. Then we have the possibility of ultimately becoming enlightened. Different schools and traditions in Tibetan Buddhism give different explanations of what is called \\"reality\\".Dr. A. Berzin. Alaya and Impure Appearance-MakingEl√≠as Capriles. the Doctrine of the Buddha and the Supreme Vehicle of Tibetan Buddhism. Part - Buddhism: a Dzogchen Outlook. Published on the Web.  Reality in the Tathagatagarbha Sutras  Prior to the period of the Tathagatagarbha Sutras, Mahayana metaphysics had been dominated by teachings on emptiness in the form of Madhyamaka philosophy. The language used by this approach is primarily negative, and the Tathagatagarbha genre of sutras can be seen as an attempt to state orthodox Buddhist teachings of dependent origination using positive language instead, to prevent people from being turned away from Buddhism by a false impression of nihilism. In these sutras the perfection of the wisdom of not-self is stated to be the true self; the ultimate goal of the path is then characterized using a range of positive language that had been used in Indian philosophy previously by essentialist philosophers, but which was now transmuted into a new Buddhist vocabulary to describe a being who has successfully completed the Buddhist path.Sallie B. King (1997), The Doctrine of Buddha Nature is Impeccably Buddhist. In: Jamie Hubbard (ed.), Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism, Univ of Hawaii Press 1997, pp. 174-192. Contrasting with some forms of Buddhism, the Buddha's teaching on 'reality' in the Tathagatagarbha Mahayana scriptures - which the Buddha states constitute the ultimate manifestation of the Mahayana Dharma (other Mahayana sutras make similar claims about their own teachings) - insists that there truly is a sphere or realm of ultimate truth - not just a repetitious cycle of interconnected elements, each dependent on the others. That suffering-filled cycle of x-generating-y-and-y-generating-z-and-z-generating-a, etc., is Samsara, the prison-house of the reincarnating non-self; whereas liberation from dependency, enforced rebirth and bondage is nirvana or reality / spiritual essence (tattva / dharmata). This sphere also bears the name Tathagatagarbha (Buddha matrix). It is the deathless realm where dependent origination holds no sway, where non-self is supplanted by the everlasting, sovereign (aishvarya) self (atman) (as a trans-historical, unconditioned, ultimate, liberating, supra-worldly yet boundless and immanent awakened mind). Of this real truth, called nirvana - which, while salvationally infused into samsara, is not bound or imprisoned in it - the Buddha states in the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra:Yamamoto, Kosho (tr.), Page, Tony (ed.) (1999-2000).The Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra in 12 volumes. London: Nirvana Publications \\"What is the Real (tattva)? Knowledge of the true attributes of Nirvana; the Tathagata, the Dharma, the Sangha, and the attributes of space ... is the Real. What is knowledge of the attributes of Nirvana? The attributes of Nirvana are eightfold. What are these eight? Cessation [of ignorance and suffering]; loveliness/ wholesomeness; Truth; Reality; Eternity, Bliss, the Self [atman], and complete Purity: that is Nirvana.\\" He further comments: \\" ... that which is endowed with the Eternal, Bliss, the Self, and Purity is stated to be the meaning of 'Real Truth' ... Moreover, the Real is the Tathagata [i.e., the Buddha]; the Tathagata is the Real ... The Tathagata is not conditioned and not tainted, but utterly blissful: this is the Real ...\\". Thus, in such doctrines, a very positive goal is envisioned, which is said to lie beyond the grasp of the five senses and the ordinary, restless mind, and only attainable through direct meditative perception and when all inner pollutants (twisted modes of view, and all moral contaminants) are purged, and the inherently deathless, spotless, radiantly shining mind of Buddha stands revealed. This is the realm of the Buddha-dhatu (popularly known as buddha nature) - inconceivable, beginning-less, endless, omniscient truth, the Dharmakaya (quintessential body-and-mind) of the Buddha. This reality is empty of all falsehood, impermanence, ignorance, afflictions, and pain, but filled with enduring happiness, purity, knowingness (jnana), and omni-radiant loving- kindness (maitri).  Vipassana  VipassanƒÅ (PƒÅli) or vipa≈õyanƒÅ (Sanskrit: ‡§µ‡§ø‡§™‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§®) in the Buddhist tradition means insight into the true nature of reality. It is a practice of realizing our reality in order to see life as it is, in turn liberating ourselves like Buddha.

It took part in the first ever tank offensive in 1916 and saw action on the Western Front again in the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917 and later in the Hundred Days Offensive. Remaining active in the army during the interwar period, in 1939 it was renamed the 1st Royal Tank Regiment. During the Second World War (1939-1945) the regiment took part in the Siege of Tobruk in the summer of 1941 and the Battle of El Alamein in October 1942, the advance up Italy in late 1943, the Normandy landings in June 1944 and the Western Allied invasion of Germany in 1945.

History A left Stuart tanks of 3rd Royal Tank Regiment, 11th Armoured Division, drive along an autobahn towards Lubeck, 2 May 1945 In 1916 the Machine Gun Corps formed a Heavy Section, later Branch, in order to crew the first tanks.

The Heavy Branch was then reformed in to a new Tank Corps and \\"C\\" Battalion then fought from Cambrai to the end of the war, being re-equipped with Whippet tanks in 1918. Lieutenant Cecil Sewell won the Battalion's only Victoria Cross for an outstanding act of bravery at Fr√©micourt in August of that year. Post war, the Tank Corps was trimmed down and received the Royal prefix with the lettered battalions being numbered and \\"C\\" became 3rd Tank Corps. In 1939 the 3 RTR was retitled from \\"3rd Royal Tank Regiment\\". With the outbreak of the Second World War the army was once more deployed to France. In 1940, 3 RTR was preparing for deployment as part of 1st Armoured Division when it was diverted at short notice to Calais. Here it fought during the four-day Siege of Calais, part of the Battle of France. All of its tanks were lost, and many personnel were killed or taken prisoner, but some escaped to Dunkirk or were evacuated from Calais before the port fell. The regiment was subsequently rebuilt in the United Kingdom as part of 3rd Armoured Brigade, its original parent formation. Shipped to the Middle East, it was part of the 1st Armoured Brigade when it was sent to defend Greece to try to stem the German invasion in March 1941. From May to mid November 1941, there was a period of reorganisation in Egypt. In 1942, it briefly amalgamated with the 5th Royal Tank Regiment, as the 3rd/5th Royal Tank Regiment, returning to its previous title a month later. It was then attached to 8th Armoured Brigade. 3 RTR was transferred back to the UK in late 1943 joining 29th Armoured Brigade. After the war in 1959, it amalgamated with the 6th Royal Tank Regiment without change of title. In 1973 and again in 1974 the regiment was deployed to Northern Ireland during the Troubles.

In the 1975-76 season, Orr was named National Coach of the Year. Early life and playing career Orr was born in Taylorville, Illinois or Yale, Kansashttp://www.legacy.com/obituaries/DesMoinesRegister/obituary.aspx?n=John- Michael- Orr&pid;=168864220http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20131231/SPORTS020604/312310106/1091/SPORTS02/Johnny- Orr-remembered-Six-standout-players-by-numbers-quotes-his-career-his-heritage- roots-other-notes?nclick_check=1 and grew up in Taylorville during the Great Depression. Orr attended Taylorville High School under coach Dolph Stanley and in his senior year (1944) led the Tornadoes to a state championship and a 45‚Äì0 record, the first team to ever finish a season undefeated in the Illinois High School Association's history. In 2007, Orr was voted one of the \\"100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament,\\" recognizing his superior performance in his appearance in the tournament. After high school Orr went to the University of Illinois and was the youngest freshman to compete in three sports. After joining the United States Navy for the end of World War II, Orr returned to the college game at Beloit College. This reunited him with his high school coach Dolph Stanley, who had come to Beloit College as athletic director, head basketball and football coach. Orr was initially drafted in 1948 BAA draft by the Minneapolis Lakers of the Basketball Association of America, the precursor to the NBA. Orr did not play for the Lakers, and was again drafted the next year in the 2nd round by the St. Louis Bombers. In 1950, Orr played 21 games for the Bombers before moving to the Waterloo Hawks for 13 more games. Coaching career In 1951, Orr was named as head coach at Dubuque Senior High School in Dubuque, Iowa, holding the position until 1959. In 1959, Orr joined the collegiate ranks, becoming an assistant coach at Wisconsin. UMass Orr attained his first collegiate head coaching position in 1963 at UMass, where he guided the team to 15‚Äì9 record in 1963‚Äì64. Michigan After one season at UMass, Orr moved to the University of Michigan in 1964, serving as an assistant under head coach Dave Strack for four seasons. In 1968 Orr was named head coach at Michigan, a position he would hold for 12 seasons. His 1973‚Äì74 team made it to the Elite Eight in the NCAA tournament and Orr was named Big Ten Coach of the Year. In 1976, Michigan was the NCAA tournament runner-up (to the undefeated Indiana Hoosiers) and Orr was named National Coach of the Year. Orr is the second winningest coach in Michigan history with 209 wins. Iowa State Orr left Michigan to become the head coach of the Iowa State Cyclones in 1980, a program that hadn't participated in an NCAA tournament since the 1940's. Orr would go on lead the team to six NCAA Tournaments in 14 seasons. The surprise move to Iowa State in 1980 came about when the Iowa State athletic director called to inquire about Orr's assistant, Bill Frieder. When Orr learned how much Iowa State was willing to pay Frieder, Orr negotiated the job for himself. Iowa State initially paid Orr $45,000 annually compared to his $33,665 salary at Michigan. Frieder then would succeed Orr at Michigan. In Orr's fourth season in Ames, Orr led the Cyclones to the 1984 NIT‚Äìonly the second postseason appearance of any sort in school history. The following season, he led the Cyclones to their first NCAA Tournament berth in 40 years. The following season, Orr's Cyclones reached the Sweet Sixteen of the 1986 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament with a second round victory over the number five ranked team in the nation, Michigan. Orr claims this was the greatest victory of his career. Orr led Iowa State to four more NCAA tournament berths before retiring from Iowa State in 1994. He remains the winningest coach in Iowa State history with 218 wins. Hilton Coliseum Orr's Iowa State teams won 76.7% of their games at Hilton Coliseum. Under Orr, attendance numbers more than doubled from the 6,000 fan average that preceded his arrival. The school band would play the theme from The Tonight Show as Orr entered the arena floor before each game and Orr would give a fist pump to the Iowa State crowd. Orr coached Iowa State to 20 victories over teams ranked in the top 25 at Hilton, with writers coining the term ‚ÄúHilton Magic.‚Äù Death Orr died on December 30, 2013 at the age of 86 at Iowa Methodist Medical Center in Des Moines. Orr suffered from complications from a head injury from a fall at home.

Their name comes from their shape, which resembles a small ear. Description An orecchietta has the shape of a small dome, with its center thinner than its edge, and with a rough surface. Like other kinds of pasta, orecchiette are made with durum wheat and water. Eggs are rarely used. In traditional Southern Italian home cooking, the dough is rolled, then cut into cubes. Each cube is pressed with a knife, dragging it on the board and making it curl (making a cavatello). The shape is then inverted over the thumb. Names and variations In the vernacular of Taranto they are called , or . In Cisternino orecchiette are made with durum wheat, they are larger and take on a different shape, with deep internal ribs, very similar to an ear. They are defined ‚Äî that is, \\"priest's ears\\". The typical dish of holidays is orecchiette with rabbit ragout. Cavatelli, strascinati (, in the vernacular of Bari) and cencioni are made like orecchiette, without the final step of forming a concave shape. Strascinati and cencioni are typically larger than orecchiette. In China, a similar type of pasta is called (mƒÅo ƒõr du«í, literally, \\"cat's ears\\"). Dishes Orecchiette are typically served with a meat such as pork, capers and a crisp white wine. The traditional dish from Apulia is orecchiette alle cime di rapa, a dish of orecchiette and rapini, also called turnip tops. Broccoli or cauliflower are also widely used as an alternative. Particularly around Capitanata and Salento, orecchiette are traditionally also dressed with tomato sauce (), sometimes with miniature meatballs or a sprinkling of ricotta or ricotta forte. The Italian cookbook Il cucchiaio d'argento (with an English translation The Silver Spoon) suggests that orecchiette are ideal for vegetable sauces.

While the story is developed by the whole group, the competitive aspect of the game is that each player has an individual goal of using all of the \\"Storytelling\\" cards he or she has in hand, and finishing the story with their own special \\"Happy Ever After\\" card. Only one player at a time is the current storyteller, giving him or her a chance to play their Storytelling cards, while the other players have a chance to \\"interrupt\\" the story and become the storyteller if, for example, the storyteller mentions something on one of the interrupting player's cards. Gameplay Each player is dealt a hand of cards that represent story elements: objects, people, events, and \\"aspects\\" often involved in fairy tales (for instance, there are cards for \\"crown\\", \\"key\\", \\"stepmother\\", \\"a death\\", \\"time passes\\", \\"sleeping\\", et cetera). These \\"Storytelling\\" cards represent ingredients of a fairy tale, i.e. words or phrases that are likely to appear in fairy tales. From a different deck of cards, each player is also dealt a single \\"Happy Ever After\\" ending card, to be kept secret from other players until it is used. The object of the game for each player is to use their cards in telling a story, finishing the story by using their Happy Ever After card. One player at a time is the storyteller. (The 2nd edition rules suggest the starting storyteller could be the \\"player with the longest beard\\", or any other method upon which the players agree.Once Upon a Time 2nd edition game rules) Whenever a story ingredient is mentioned, if any player has a Storytelling card for that ingredient, he or she can play it and become (or continue being) the storyteller. A player may be required to draw extra Storytelling cards (for example, when they are the storyteller and are interrupted by another player who becomes the new storyteller, or if he or she hesitates for too long while telling the story). If the storyteller ends the story with the ending on their Happy Ever After card, and is out of cards, he or she wins. Players are expected to cooperate (to some extent) in order to avoid contradictions in the story as it develops, for the story to make sense, and (according to the rulebook) that any ending to the story is \\"satisfying\\".

Pillar of Fire missionaries, November 25, 1914 Assembly Hall service c. 1965 in Zarephath, New Jersey Missionary homes of the Pillar of Fire Church in 1966 History=Founding In 1901, the Church was founded by Alma Bridwell White in Denver, Colorado. The Pillar of Fire was originally incorporated as the Pentecostal Union, but changed its name to distance itself from Pentecostalism in 1915. While the Pillar of Fire is Methodist in doctrine, Alma White and her followers believed that the Methodist Church had become corrupt. Alma White and the members of the Pillar of Fire dedicated themselves to the holiness movement in the Wesleyan tradition. Adherents were referred to as \\"Holy Rollers\\" and \\"holy jumpers\\" because of their religious frenzy. White was noted for her association with the Ku Klux Klan, her feminism, anti-Catholicism, antisemitism, anti- pentecostalism, racism, and nativism. Ku Klux Klan, historical intolerant ideologies, and Ku Klux Klan repudiation thumbrightKlanswomen gather on August 31, 1929 in front of Assembly Hall, Zarephath, New Jersey, for \\"Patriotic Day\\" during annual Camp Meeting. The Good Citizen, July 1926 Branford Clarke illustration in The Ku Klux Klan in Prophecy In the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, the Pillar of Fire Church was vocal in its support of the Ku Klux Klan, to an extent which was unique for a religious denomination. Alma White spoke and wrote prolifically of her and the Pillar of Fire Church's support for the Klan and many of the Klan's principles including anti- Catholicism, white supremacy, antisemitism, nativism, and temperance. In 1943, shortly before her death, she and the Pillar of Fire Church significantly but not completely distanced themselves from the then discredited and nearly bankrupt Klan organization, while continuing to promote many of the Klan's intolerant principles. In a 1920s sermon she republished in 1943, she said > We have no connection with the Klan organization. We endorse them in the > principles for which they stand. However there is no room in our hearts for > racial prejudice.Guardians of Liberty, Vol. 1, Alma White, page 120. Yet White and the Pillar of Fire advocated for white supremacy in the same 1943 book-set which asserted distaste for racial prejudice. In her chapter titled \\"White Supremacy\\" she wrote > The slaveholder, in many instances, was as much to be pitied as the slaves. > He, too, was a victim of the system. ... .Where the slaves were well treated > they were happy and contented ... But some radicals could never see this > side of the question. They dwelt continually on the cruelties of a few hard > taskmasters and ignored the good people who had the welfare of their > dependants at heart. No matter what the better class of slave owners might > do, they had to bear the stigma of cruelty with the worst of tyrants. ... > .Where property rights are involved, supported by the government, the only > safe and sane way to make wrongs right is by cool-headed procedure.Guardians > of Liberty, Vol. 3, Alma White, Chapter 7, White Supremacy, page 103. She also said to the New Brunswick Daily Home News, > \\"My people are not members of the Klan, but we agree with some of the things > that they stand for to assert our American right of free speech. We have > always stood for one hundred percent Americanism and so does the Klan, so > naturally we agree there.\\"Guardians of Liberty, Vol. 1, page 119 Yet the Pillar of Fire's pulpit and the Pillar of Fire's printing operation were used extensively to advocate for many of the most intolerant of Klan values. In 1922, Bishop Alma White preached a sermon promoting the Klan at the Pillar of Fire Church in Brooklyn, New York (which coincidentally was incinerated by the 1960 New York air disaster) and published that sermon in The Good Citizen. The speech was titled \\"Ku Klux Klan and Woman's Causes\\" and one section was subtitled \\"White Supremacy.\\" > The Klansmen stand for the supremacy of the white race, which is perfectly > legitimate and in accordance with the teachings of the Holy Writ, and > anything that has been decreed by the Almighty should not work a hardship on > the colored race ... It is within the rights of civilization for the white > race to hold the supremacy; and no injustice to the colored man to stay in > the environment where he was placed by the Creator. ... When the black man > was liberated it was time for women to be enfranchised, without which the > colored man with his newly-acquired rank became her political master. ... > The white women bore the sting of humiliation for more than half a century > in being placed in an inferior position to the black men in the use of the > ballot and the rights of citizenship ... To whom shall we look to champion > the cause and to protect the rights of women? Is there not evidence that the > Knights of the Klu Klux Klan are the prophets of a new and better age? The Pillar of Fire Church strongly argued against social and political equality for Blacks and advocated for racial segregation and repeal of the fifteenth amendment. The Pillar allowed the Klan to hold meetings or cross burnings on at least several of the church's numerous properties including numerous documented Klan gatherings in Zarephath, New Jersey; Brooklyn, New York; Bound Brook, New Jersey; Longmont, Colorado; and Westminster, Colorado. White participated directly in many of these meetings. During this time, the Pillar of Fire Church published The Good Citizen, a monthly 16 page political magazine and three books, The Ku Klux Klan in Prophecy, Klansmen: Guardians of Liberty, and Heroes of the Fiery Cross, all of which heavily promoted the Klan and its agenda from 1921 until 1933. Ideologically, in these publications, the Pillar of Fire Church promoted anti-Catholicism, antisemitism, nativism, and white supremacy, all primarily under the guise of patriotism. The radical equality at the heart of the Christian message eventually caused the organization to repudiate its historical relationship with the KKK at its website in 2009: > Much talk has also arisen over her brief but significant association with > the KKK, which has also been publicly condemned and repented of by the POF > leadership with a request for full forgiveness. Despite these and other > errors in its history, the Lord in His grace and mercy has chosen to bless > the ministry. And in the local paper in 1997: > We regret, repudiate and repent, and ask for full forgiveness for anything > in our past that is short of Christian standards based on God's Word, > following Jesus' model prayer that teaches us to ever pray and forgive us > our sins for we also forgive everyone that is indebted to us. () We > specifically regret mistakes and bad judgement by previous generations or > anyone in our membership of the past. While the Pillar of Fire's repudiation characterized its association with the Klan as brief, it continued for at least several decades to promote its ideologies of intolerance for religious and racial minorities and of equality for white Protestant women. In 1943, 22 years after the church began publicly working with the Klan, it republished Alma White's pro-KKK books as a three- volume set under the title Guardians of Liberty, reaffirming its positions in support of anti-Semitism, white supremacy, nativism and most notably, anti- Catholicism. Volumes II and III of Guardians had introductions by Arthur White, affirming his support for his mother's intolerant ideologies, primarily but not exclusively in regard to anti-Catholicism. After his mother died in 1946, he was the Pillar of Fire's general superintendent until 1981. 1950s ‚Äì Present Following the death of the founder, under the leadership of her son, Arthur Kent White, the religious fervor declined and the emphasis on outreach evangelization and church planting ended; the organization branches in America fell from a high of around 52 to the current six. Today the Pillar of Fire has branches in Zarephath, New Jersey; Denver, Colorado; Westminster, Colorado; Cincinnati, Ohio, Los Angeles, California; and Pacifica, California. It primarily operates four ministry focuses, namely local church, radio, education, and missions. Name The name of Pillar of Fire comes from , which states: \\"By day the Lord went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day or night. Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people.\\" Beliefs The organization's theological position is self-described as Wesleyan‚ÄìArminian.Pillar of Fire Church: Doctrinal Statement in Brief, accessed August 31, 2006 The central beliefs of the Pillar of Fire are as follows: biblical inerrancy, Trinitarianism, the physical resurrection of Jesus, the consubstantiality of the Holy Spirit, the \\"universal depravity of the human race\\", the necessity of \\"repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ\\", belief in \\"justification by faith and in Christian perfection, or entire sanctification, as a second definite work of grace\\", the immortality of the soul, the resurrection of the dead, and premillennialism. Continued work of the Pillar of Fire The Pillar of Fire continues its work today working in three main areas: radio, education, and missions, both local and overseas.Pillar of Fire United States congregations * Alma Temple, Denver * Belleview Community Chapel, Westminster, Colorado * Coastside Community Church, Pacifica, California * City Church Cincinnati, Cincinnati * Pillar of Fire Church, Los Angeles * Zarephath Christian Church, Zarephath, New Jersey Zarephath Health Center The Zarephath Health Center was opened in 2003Zarephath Health Center and utilizes volunteer physicians, nurses and support people to meet the health care needs of the poor and uninsured on the campus at Zarephath, New Jersey.

The mission organized a Charitable Trust on 19 September 1992, and was registered as a charity in December 1992 (Charity No. 1015529). In response to a complaint received by the Charity Commission in 2002, an inquiry was held, the charitable trust dissolved and transferred its assets to the U.S. organization, and the charitable trust was removed from the registry as it had ceased to exist. One of the stated aims of this mission was to evangelize the local Jewish population in the vicinity of the mission.

History Constantia, the first wine farm in Southern Africa, was established in 1685 by the VOC Governor of the Cape Simon van der Stel, and was used to produce wine as well as other fruit and vegetables and cattle farming. Van der Stel, a keen viticulturist, had been the first to recognize the potential of the decomposed granite soil in the sheltered valley facing False Bay and bounded by sea on both sides after he had had soil samples collected from all over the Cape. He chose this area to plant his vines and named it Constantia. Following van der Stel's death in 1712 the estate was broken up and sold in three parts (Groot Constantia; Klein Constantia; and Bergvliet). The Cloete family In 1778 the portion of the estate surrounding van der Stel's mansion was sold to the Cloete family, who planted extensive vineyards of mostly Frontignac, Pontac, red and white Muscadel and a little Steen (Chenin blanc) and extended and improved the mansion. On the death of Hendrik Cloete in 1818, the estate was split, and the upper portion became the property of Cloete's son Johan Gerhard Cloete under the name Klein Constantia. Constantia wine It was under the Cloete family ownership that Constantia's sweet dessert wine made primarily from vine-dried Muscat de Frontignan grapes reached the height of its fame. Napoleon Bonaparte had as much as 1,126 liters (297 gallons) of Constantia wine shipped in wooden casks each year to Longwood House, his home in exile on St Helena from 1815 until his death in 1821. The Count de las Cases reported that, on his deathbed, Napoleon refused everything offered to him but a glass of Constantia wine.bloomberg.com Napoleon's Deathbed Wine Has Renaissance in Cape Town Vineyards In Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen's character Mrs Jennings recommends a little Constantia for \\"its healing powers on a disappointed heart\\".ewine.co.za Klein Constantia Vin de Constance In Charles Dickens' last (and unfinished) novel, The Mystery of Edwin Drood, Constantia wine is served to the reverend Septimus by his mother. \\"As, whenever the Reverend Septimus fell a-musing, his good mother took it to be an infallible sign that he ‚Äòwanted support,‚Äô the blooming old lady made all haste to the dining-room closet, to produce from it the support embodied in a glass of Constantia and a home-made biscuit.\\"Charles Dickens The Mystery of Edwin Drood, Chapter X In Charles Baudelaire's Les fleurs du mal poem XXVI entitled sed non satiata Baudelaire compares the charms of his beloved to the pleasures of the night and Constantia wine: \\"Even more than Constantia, than opium, than Nuits, I prefer the elixer of your mouth, where love performs its slow dance.\\"wosa.co.za The Reputation of South African Wines The De Villiers family In 1913 Klein Constantia was purchased by Abraham Lochner de Villiers, a wealthy milliner from Paarl, and his American heiress wife, Clara Hussey. The house and its estate were restored when the couple made the Klein Constantia manor house their home during the year before the First World War. Life at Klein Constantia took an exuberant turn. \\"It was like something out of the Great Gatsby\\" said one enthusiastic guest. \\"You cannot imagine the glamour of it all\\". Dressed in the latest fashion, Clara, whose grandfather was the first Pittsburgh steel tycoon, threw parties which were the talk of Cape Town, where Russian caviar was served, swathed in barrels of ice, together with oysters and smoked salmon; orchestras played, and peacocks strolled on the lawns. The Pittsburgh fortune was not confined to fine motor cars and caviar. Abraham and Clara set about the transformation of Klein Constantia with style and determination. Fine furniture and paintings were brought for the house, they added a dining hall, with a minstrel's gallery, a private chapel, and then a classical pavilion which stood beside a large swimming pool set in landscaped gardens. Winemaking continued to play an important role and the farm produced good wine and excellent port. Devoted to Klein Constantia as they were, Clara and Abraham were determined that the farm should remain within the de Villiers family. As they had no children of their own, their nephew Jan, son of Rocco and Annie de Villiers of Paarl, was designated as their heir, and sent to the University of California at Berkeley for two years to study viticulture. When Jan returned to Klein Constantia he remained until Abraham's death in 1930, when he then left for the Transvaal, returning only in 1955 when his Aunt Clara died, whereupon he inherited the property. With the passing of Clara Hussey de Villiers, the era of glamour and splendour came to an end. The Jooste Era In 1980 Duggie Jooste bought Klein Constantia, redeveloped it, and with the help of Professor Chris Orferr of Stellenbosch University and winemaker, Ross Gower, created and began selling a new recreated version of Constantia wine made from Muscat Blanc √† Petits Grains.sawinesonline.co.uk History of Constantia Duggie's son, Lowell, joined the team and together they helped to revive Klein Constantia's wines and the entire estate: completing work on a full cellar and tasting room by the mid 1980s. Klein Constantia released its first vintage of the modern era in 1986 to much critical acclaim and quickly developed a reputation as one of South Africa's top wine estates. New ownership In May 2011 the Jooste family sold Klein Constantia to Czech businessman Zdenƒïk Bakala and Charles Harman from the UK. Both have been regular visitors to South Africa for the past twenty years, and together with their families now divide their time between their respective homes in Europe and Cape Town. Mr Bakala is co-founder of the global diversified investment group, BXR, of which Mr Harman is the CEO. In June 2012, Klein Constantia merged with Stellenbosch-based vineyard, Anwilka (formerly co-owned by Lowell Jooste, Hubert de Bo√ºard and Bruno Prats) and Klein Constantia welcomed two new shareholders in de Bo√ºard, of Ch√¢teau Ang√©lus and Prats, formerly of Ch√¢teau Cos d'Estournel. Wine production Klein Constantia is noted particularly for its production of high-quality white wines, including Sauvignon blanc and Riesling and is world-renowned for its revival of the famous 18th and 19th century Constantia dessert wine, known today as Vin de Constance. Today, Vin de Constance consistently scores over 90 points in Wine Spectator Magazine and other rating publications like Robert Parker and in September 2012 Neal Martin of eRobertParker awarded Vin de Constane 2007 a 97-point rating. The current portfolio of Klein Constantia wine includes the super-premium Estate range and the lifestyle KC range as well as special release wines like the single vineyard Perdeblokke Sauvignon blanc and a M√©thode Cap Classique. Anwilka produces a flagship eponymous red wine and a second label 'little brother' red wine called, Petit Fr√®re. Klein Constantia's icon wine remains, Vin de Constance. Cape Muslim heritage kramat in Klein Constantia. Klein Constantia is the site of the kramat or grave of a revered Cape Muslim teacher and cleric, Sheik Abdurachman Matebe Shah, who is said to have been one of the three teachers who brought Islam to southern Africa in the seventeenth century. After being captured during the Dutch conquest of Sumatra, Sheik Abdurachman was banished to the Cape Colony in 1661, only ten years after it was founded. He is thought to have died on the site that the kramat now stands in either 1681 or 1682.

El Chich√≥n became famous for its 1982 eruption. In little under a week, the presumed dormant volcano produced three plinian eruptions (March 29, April 3, and April 4). The eruptions generated a substantial amount of sulfur dioxide and particulates into the atmosphere. The total volume of the eruption was much smaller than the famous eruption of Pinatubo in 1991; however El Chich√≥n's impacts were equally significant on global climate.Robock, A. (2000). Volcanic eruptions and climate. Reviews of Geophysics, 38(2), 191-219 El Chich√≥n is often overlooked in comparison to other historic eruptions, yet the 1982 eruptions provide important lessons on preparation for volcanic disasters and the influence volcanoes can have on climate. 1982 eruption The 1982 eruption of El Chich√≥n is the largest volcanic disaster in modern Mexican history. The powerful 1982 explosive eruptions of high-sulfur, anhydrite-bearing magma destroyed the summit lava dome and were accompanied by pyroclastic flows and surges that devastated an area extending about 8 km around the volcano.Francis, P., and Oppenheimer, C., 2004, Volcanoes, Oxford University Press, 521pp A total of 9 villages were completely destroyed, killing 1,900 people. A new 1-km-wide, 300-m-deep crater was created that now contains an acidic crater lake. The landscape was covered in ash up to 40 cm in depth. Over 24,000 km2 of countryside was affected, devastating coffee, cocoa, banana crops, and cattle ranches. The eruption caused natural dams to form along the Rio Magdalena river, inducing lahars, which destroyed key infrastructure. The total damage caused by the 1982 eruption is believed to amount to $55 million (equivalent to $132 million in present-day US dollars). Lack of preparation With more than 600 years since the last major eruption of El Chich√≥n, few people were aware of the volcanic risk. Most presumed it to be a dormant volcano or extinct. Throughout 1980 and 1981 earthquakes were felt in the surrounding regions, and geologists hazard mapped the region highlighting risks, no increases were seen in monitoring activity. Climate impacts It was a VEI-5 eruption, injecting 7 million metric tonnes of sulfur dioxide and 20 million metric tonnes total of particulate material into the stratosphere,Robock, Alan, 1984: Climate model simulations of the effects of the El Chich√≥n eruption. Geof√≠sica Internacional, 23, 403-414. which circulated the Earth in three weeks.Robock, Alan and Michael Matson, 1983: Circumglobal transport of the El Chich√≥n volcanic dust cloud. Science, 221, 195-197. The amount of sulfur dioxide is comparable to the 20 million tonnes of the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. The eruption occurred just as the 1982‚Äì83 El Ni√±o event was initiating; because of this several scientists suggested that the El Chich√≥n eruption caused the El Ni√±o. However, climate modeling and detailed studies of past eruptions and El Ni√±o have shown that there are no plausible theories connecting these two events, and that the timing was merely a coincidence. As a result of the simultaneous eruption and El Ni√±o, the climate felt the impacts of both, making it challenging to separate their effects on temperature. Generally a volcanic event would induce global cooling, particularly in summer months, however no cooling was seen in the first year after the El Chich√≥n eruption, because the El Ni√±o produced large compensating warming. The climatic effects also triggered winter warming patterns observed within northern hemisphere continents in 1982 and 1983, with temperatures increasing over North America, Europe, and Siberia. During the same winter, Alaska, Greenland, the Middle East, and China witnessed colder temperatures than normal, highlighting regional variation. The variation is said to be a result of volcanic aerosols impact on the atmospheric wind patterns, including the Arctic Oscillation.  Ash properties  The deposition of ash in the surroundings of the volcano varies with distance from the volcano since the ash particles vary in size. This is problematic, since ash samples are collected from the ground in order for the optical and chemical properties to be measured which too will vary with distance from the volcano. Therefore, one can only measure certain relevant parameters for samples collected from the air or from the ground. However, some samples are of greater interest than others. Thus, the most important samples are the ones furthest from the volcano (80 km, 100 km,) due to the fact that they are the most likely to reach the stratosphere. In particular, the 80 km one has shown similarities with stratospheric ash samples.  Chemical properties  For ash samples around 100 km away from the volcano, the presence of the soluble and non soluble components has been identified. The water-soluble components present in the highest concentration are Ca2+ and SO42‚àí. There have also been traces of Na+, K+, Mg2+, HCO3‚àí and Cl‚àí. The non-soluble part consists mostly of SiO2 (around 59%) and Al2O3 (around 18%) along with trace amounts (less than 5%) of other components, such as CaO, Na2O and Fe2O3.  Optical properties  For the El Chich√≥n cloud, the optical depth has been measured to be around 0.3 around mid-visible wavelengths. The imaginary part of the refractive index, describing the attenuation of radiation for the 80 km sample, varies between 0.004 at 300 nm and 0.001 at 700 nm. Based on these results, the real part of the refractive index of the stratospheric El Chichon ash is estimated around 1.52, while the imaginary part is expected to be slightly less than the one measured for the ground samples.

It was a corridor of roads and trails between the Chesapeake Bay region (mainly the Petersburg, Virginia area) and the Cherokee, Catawba, and other Native- American groups in the Piedmont region of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Indians had used and maintained much of the path for their expansive trading network for centuries prior to its use by Europeans and/or European- Americans. Indian and later European/European-American settlements occupied key points along the path. That section of the Trading Path through the Carolina piedmont was also known as the Upper Road, and a portion between North Carolina and Georgia was called the Lower Cherokee Traders Path. Both Natives and newcomers mainly used the Trading Path for commercial cargo carriage. In early colonial times, Virginian traders used the path to travel to Native American towns in the Waxhaws. They led long pack caravans of horses carrying \\"loads of guns, gunpowder, knives, jewelry, blankets, and hatchets, among other goods\\", and travel southwest to Indian villages along the journey to the Waxhaws region, in the vicinity of present-day Mecklenburg County. \\"Trading Path, Marker L-35\\", North Carolina Historical Markers Highway Program, Department of Cultural Resources, accessed 3 Apr 2010 They exchanged European goods for furs and deerskins. Because the path was well laid out through the complex geography of the piedmont area, connecting fords of many streams, it was roughly followed by the 19th-century railroad. Later, engineers who designed Interstate 85 followed much of this route again from Petersburg, Virginia, to roughly the Georgia state border. Many of the earliest towns along its route remain to this day. Many remnants of the Trading Path are still visible. The Piedmont Urban Crescent essentially has developed along the Trading Path, and since the late 19th century has had steady growth. It is a spine of polycentric urban development in North Carolina. Cities of the Crescent are the centers of government, finance, education and research, and business in the state.

The holotype, SMP VP-900, was recovered from the Late Campanian De-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation and consists of an incomplete skull. Nodocephalosaurus (Greek nodus = knob, kephale = head and sauros = lizard) is a monotypic genus, including only the type species, Nodocephalosaurus kirtlandensis. Dinosaurs like Nodocephalosaurus resembled Asian forms, and may be evidence for Asian dinosaurs migrating to North America in the Late Cretaceous. Description and classification Skull (upper right), compared to other ankylosaurids The pattern of cranial ornamentation present in this ankylosaurid \\"is distinguished by semi-inflated to bulbous, polygonal, cranial osteoderms that are bilaterally and symmetrically arranged on the frontonasal region of the skull\\", and includes deltoid quadratojugal flanges and pyramid-shaped squamosal bosses. Paul estimated its length at 4.5 meters (15 ft) and its weight at 1.5 tonnes (1.65 short tons). The type description noted the taxon's similarity to the Mongolian ankylosaurids Saichania chulsanensis and Tarchia gigantea, and suggested that these three taxa form a clade within the subfamily Ankylosaurinae. However, Vickaryous and others consider this assignment provisional and list the genus as Ankylosaurinae incertae sedis. There is also evidence of a paranasal sinus cavity in the maxilla. Sullivan also noted that material previously collected from the Kirtland Formation and assigned to the taxa Euoplocephalus or Panoplosaurus might actually represent additional remains of Nodocephalosaurus.

During its time in production, the Commodore was the largest and most luxurious Hudson model.  First generation = 1941  The Commodore and the Commodore Custom names debuted in Hudson's 1941 model line. Commodore models rode exclusively on the wheelbase, while Commodore Customs rode either on the company's wheelbase for coupes, or for sedans. The Commodore was powered by Hudson's I6 producing , or by Hudson's I8 that produced . The Commodore series was Hudson's largest model range in its debut year, consisting of sedans, coupes, and convertibles. Hudson used a forward hinged hood that opened from the rear by the windshield with the front end of the hood sliding downward over the grille. Elements of the interior and exterior were styled by Betty Thatcher, \\"the first woman designer to be employed by a car manufacturer\\".  1942  For 1942, the cars received a facelift. This included concealed running boards, modestly enlarged front grilles, and external trim arrangements. Hudson offered an optional \\"Drive-Master\\" vacuum assisted clutch and servo-operated transmission with three modes: \\"automatic\\" shifting and clutching, automated clutching only, or fully manual. The firm promoted its economy over luxury during the shortened model year that ended in January, 1942, as U.S. war production accelerated. Second generation= 1946  1946 Hudson Commodore Eight coup√© Hudson began its postwar automobile production on August 30, 1945. Body styles were trimmed to Sedan, Club Coupe, and Convertible. The designs were based on the 1942 models. There were minor cosmetic changes from the pre-war versions with one exception, the car's grille now had a concave center section. Hudson automobiles were more fully equipped than competitive makes, and all Hudson models received door arm rests, twin air-horns, ashtrays, windshield wipers, stop lights, locking glove box, sealed beam headlights, and deep pile carpeting. Commodore and Commodore Customs added foam rubber seat cushions (Hudson was the first automaker to introduce foam seat cushions), door-step courtesy lights, rear arm rest (sedans) and gold etched lettering on the dash board panel.  1947  Production of the 1947 Hudson Commodore Eight increased to 12,593 from the previous year's 8,193.  Third generation = 1948  Introduced in December 1947, the Hudson Commodore was one of the first new-design postwar cars made. The 1948 model year inaugurated Hudson's trademarked \\"Monobuilt\\" construction or \\"step-down\\" automobile. The new models were designed by Frank Spring. The cars had a light, but strong semi-unit body with a perimeter frame. Because of the encircling frame, passengers stepped down into the vehicles. Hudson's step-down design made the body lower than contemporary cars. It offered passengers the safety of being surrounded by the car's chassis with a lower center of gravity. In addition to the added safety of being surrounded by the car's chassis, the step-down also allowed Hudson to gain weight savings provided through unibody construction, making for a well-performing automobile. The cars featured slab-sided bodies with fully integrated fenders. Brougham and sedans were fastbacks while convertibles and coupes were notchbacks. A character line ran from the front to back further lowering the car even more visually, so \\"the new Hudson looked like a dream car straight from the auto show.\\" In 1948, Commodores came in one series, and were available in either I8 or I6 power. Interiors were upholstered in broadcloth on sedans, leather on convertibles. Again, Hudson continued to provide numerous standard features that other manufacturers classified as upcharge options. Commodore Eight production rose to 35,315 units.  1949  1949 Hudson Commodore sedan For 1949, the Commodore line was enlarged to include more luxurious Custom models. As a marketing promotion, Hudson had plastic specialists use scaled-down blueprints to develop transparent models of the Commodore Eight sedan to demonstrate and promote the design and construction of the cars.  1950  1950 Hudson Commodore 4-door sedan There were only nominal trim changes on the exterior of the cars in successive model years. A new a Custom Commodore convertible model debuted in mid-April 1950.  1951  In 1951, Hudson introduced a new I6 engine and offered General Motors' Hydra-Matic as an optional transmission. The grille was redesigned from a rather rectangular shape to an oval shape, a design which would carry through to 1953. The grille would be redesigned again in 1954, the last year for the famous aerodynamic Hudson body style which had reigned from 1948 to 1954.  1952  1952 Hudson Commodore 2-door hardtopIn its final year in 1952, the Commodore was split into a Six series and an Eight series. The exterior received another trim change, but by the end of 1953, the Step-Down styling was beginning to look outdated. Instead of redesigning the senior Hudsons, company President A. E. Barit pushed ahead with the firm's plan for the Jet compact. Beginning in 1953, Hudson would field only the Hudson Hornet and Hudson Wasp line, and introduce the ill-fated Hudson Jet compact car line.  1957 showcar  Following Hudson's merger with Nash to form American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1954, Hudson automobile production was switched to AMC's facility in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Following a weak 1955 model year, AMC chose to hand over the Hudson styling contract to Richard Arbib, who created a unique look for the Hudson line based on what he termed as \\"V-Line\\" styling. The move failed to attract new customers to Hudson, and production fell beneath the brand's disastrous 1955 model year product. In its final year, the Hudson brand was pared down to a single model, the Hudson Hornet in two trim levels, the top-level Custom and the Super. However, during the show car season, AMC issued a one-off 1957 Hudson Commodore show car that was identical to the production Hornet, but featured gold exterior trim and special upholstery.

Birth and family William was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the son of William Ragsdale and Emma McAfee Cannon. Bishop Cannon was raised in Dalton, Georgia. He never married. Education William graduated from the University of Georgia in Athens in 1937, and from Yale Divinity School, New Haven, Connecticut in 1940. He earned his Ph.D. degree from Yale University in 1942. Ordained and academic ministry Cannon served churches in Oxford before joining the faculty of Candler School of Theology, Emory University in 1943. From 1953 until 1968 Cannon served as the dean of the seminary. In the mid-1960s Dean Cannon defended Emory's retention of Religion Professor Thomas J.J. Altizer, a proponent of the death-of-God position. This position later came to be known as the God is Dead controversy. Cannon also guided Candler through racial integration. Cannon was regularly elected as a delegate to U.M. Jurisdictional and General Conferences, beginning in 1948. During the administration of Jimmy Carter, Cannon served as an unofficial envoy of the President. Cannon had the high honor of being a Protestant observer at the Vatican II Council of the Roman Catholic Church in Rome in 1965. Later, as a bishop, he also observed the Extraordinary Synod of the R.C. Church in 1985. He became friends with Pope John Paul II, who sent a statement to be read at Cannon's funeral in 1997. Episcopal ministry Cannon was highly influential in the Council of Bishops of the U.M. Church. For example, he delivered the episcopal address at the 1984 General Conference, the highest honor conferred on a bishop by his/her episcopal colleagues. As a bishop, Cannon stressed Christian education and evangelism, and was known for his classically orthodox, Wesleyan positions. As a bishop he was assigned, successively, to the Raleigh Episcopal Area (1968‚Äì72), the Richmond Area (1970‚Äì72), the Atlanta Area (1972‚Äì80), and the Raleigh Area again (1980‚Äì84). Cannon also served as a member of the board of trustees at Emory, Asbury College, and Duke University. He was a member of the executive committee of the World Methodist Council for a time, as well. He retired to Georgia in 1984, becoming bishop-in-residence at the Northside U.M.C. in Atlanta. In 1994 he was one of the principal founders of The Confessing Movement of the U.M. Church. This movement focused on the Church's mission to \\"retrieve its classical doctrinal identity, and to live it out as disciples of Christ.\\" Bishop Cannon died in 1997 at the Crawford Long Hospital in Atlanta. He is buried in West Hill Cemetery in Dalton. Cannon Chapel at Emory is named in his honor.

He was formerly the set- up man for the San Diego Padres and the Texas Rangers. He was also the closer for Japan's 2006 World Baseball Classic winning team. Otsuka threw a low-90's 4-seam fastball (tops out at about 94 mph) that is very straight, along with a hard, late-breaking slider. He employed an unorthodox pitching delivery wherein he lifted his lead leg up very slowly, tapped his glove, then fired to home plate, making his pitches look faster coming out of his hand and thus harder to pick up. MLB career=San Diego Padres Otsuka came to the United States after several years of pitching in the Japanese League when his former team, the Chunichi Dragons, used the posting system to solicit bids from MLB clubs for the right to negotiate with him. The Padres offered the top bid, and signed him to a three-year contract on December 9, . Otsuka made his major league debut April 6, 2004 against the Los Angeles Dodgers, earning the loss after giving up a walk-off single to Robin Ventura. He struck out Paul Lo Duca for his first major league strikeout. On January 6, , Otsuka was traded to the Rangers, along with pitcher Adam Eaton and minor league catcher Billy Killian, in exchange for pitcher Chris Young, first baseman Adri√°n Gonz√°lez, and outfielder Terrmel Sledge. Texas Rangers Otsuka took over the role as the closer for the Rangers during the 2006 season, replacing Francisco Cordero, and recorded 32 saves while posting a 2.11 ERA. However, on December 19, 2006, the Rangers announced that newly signed √âric Gagn√© would take over the closer role in , with Otsuka moving back into a set-up role. On January 13, 2007, T. R. Sullivan reported that, in an interview in Japan, Otsuka said \\"If there is the team which needs me as a closer, I am going to think about (the trade)\\". Due to Gagn√© starting the season on the DL, Otsuka began the 2007 season as the closer. With the trade of Gagne to the Boston Red Sox, Otsuka assumed the closer's role again. However, Otsuka went on the DL after experiencing tightness in his throwing shoulder. His stand-in was C. J. Wilson. Otsuka was not offered a new contract by the Rangers and became a free agent on December 12, 2007. Post MLB and Retirement On January 10, , Otsuka announced that he would undergo elbow surgery. Shinano Grandserows Otsuka was the player-manager of the Shinano Grandserows of the Japanese Baseball Challenge League from 2012‚Äì2014. The team held his retirement ceremony on September 15, 2014.Gen. \\"BC League Final Standings, Playoff Schedule, Updates; Gunma wins League Championship,\\" Yakyubaka.com (September 16, 2014). Coaching career=Chunichi Dragons Otsuka returned to the Chunichi Dragons on the 3rd of October 2015 as one of the second team pitching coaches. In 2016, with first team pitching coach Shinichi Kondoh on leave to have hernia surgery, Otsuka helped lead the first team pitchers in spring camp. He however returned to working with the second team following Kondoh's return. On 26 September, Otsuka was unveiled as the pitching coach for the U-23 Japanese national team for the 2016 WBSC U-23 World Cup.

During this operation, poor inter-service communication and cooperation between the Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe and inexperience resulted in the loss of two German ships, despite the lack of Allied forces, through friendly fire bombing and German or British mines. Background On February 1940, the Kriegsmarine had grown suspicious of the activities of British fishing vessels around the Dogger Bank. Luftwaffe reconnaissance flights reported the presence of submarines, so it was decided to intercept the British vessels with the six destroyers of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla: Friedrich Eckoldt (flotilla leader), Richard Beitzen, Erich Koellner, Theodor Riedel, Max Schultz and Leberecht Maass, escorted by Luftwaffe fighters. At about the same time, X. Fliegerkorps of the Luftwaffe planned to execute a postponed anti-shipping operation over the North Sea, using two squadrons of Heinkel He 111 bombers. The Kriegsmarine had been denied its own air wing (\\"Marineflieger\\") and was dependent upon the Luftwaffe for air support, which remained under direct Luftwaffe control. Exchanges of information and plans and requests for support had to traverse a lengthy command chain. Execution The sortie began at 19:00 on 19 February 1940. The flotilla proceeded at high speed through a cleared channel between German defensive minefields, without the fighter air cover that had been requested. In the sea and weather conditions they were clearly visible, from their wakes, but they wished to clear the mined area quickly. The flotilla was passed twice by a German bomber, which was uncertain of the ships' status. It made no recognition signals and, as a result, it was taken to be a British reconnaissance aircraft and fired upon by the ships. Fire was returned by the aircrew. Each side was now convinced of the other's hostility. The German aircraft attacked. On the first bombing run, one of three bombs hit Leberecht Maass. While the rest of the flotilla was ordered to continue in formation, Friedrich Eckoldt went alongside ready to help. The Heinkel made a second run and two bombs hit Leberecht Maass, which was broken in two by large explosions. The bomber returned to its base, unaware, until then, of the other ships in the flotilla. Immediately after the explosions, the remainder of the flotilla attempted to rescue the crew. Just after 20:00, Max Schultz exploded and sank, probably striking a mine. What followed was confusion. There were many erroneous reports of air attack, submarines detected and torpedoes; ships dashed back and forth. Theodor Riedel dropped depth charges on a supposed submarine and the explosions temporarily jammed its rudder. After 30 minutes of action, the flotilla commander ordered the surviving four ships to return home. There were no survivors from Max Schultz and only 60 from Leberecht Maass: in all, 578 German sailors died. Aftermath The initial view of the naval command in Wilhelmshaven ‚Äî Marinegruppe West ‚Äî was that the flotilla had run into a German minefield. The presence of enemy submarines was discounted. At 23:00, naval command received a report from X. Fliegerkorps that a ship had been engaged and destroyed in the general area of the sinkings, at the same time. Subsequent reports appeared to confirm the \\"friendly fire\\" attack. Neither the destroyers nor the Luftwaffe squadrons had been told of the other's presence, although information had been passed to the relevant commands. By the time the risks became apparent, it was too late to advise aircrews. The official German investigation showed that there had been inadequate communication between the Luftwaffe and the Kriegsmarine. None of the responsible officers were called to account.

DiCorcia created ten limited edition prints of each photograph in the book and they were sold for US$20,000 to US$30,000 each. Lawsuit In 2005, Nussenzweig learned of the photograph and filed a lawsuit, claiming that diCorcia and Pace/MacGill had violated his privacy rights under Sections 50 and 51 of New York's Civil Rights Law and that, as a Klausenburg Orthodox Jew, such a display would violate the Commandment in Torah against graven images.

Early life Born 5 December 1928, in Buffalo, New York, Meyers attended public schools and in 1950 earned a Bachelor of Science in engineering and in 1954 a Master of Science magna cum laude in business from Carnegie Mellon University. He joined the Ford Motor Company in 1950, but his work at the automaker was cut by military service. Meyers was an officer in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War. Meyers next worked for Chrysler Corporation. During the eight years with the automaker, he became Director of Manufacturing for the company's overseas plants in 1961 and lived in Geneva, Switzerland for three years. American Motors In 1962 Meyers was appointed Director of Purchasing for American Motors Corporation in Detroit. He was promoted to Director of Manufacturing, Vice-President of Manufacturing, Vice-President of the Product (Engineering) Group, and Executive Vice-President. In charge of product development, Meyers introduced AMC's innovative \\"AMC Buyer Protection Plan\\" that included the industry's first 12-month or bumper-to-bumper warranty. The number of models was reduced to remove basic, stripped versions, but the centerpiece was improved quality during the production, although Meyers said \\"I don't claim we've magically and finally licked all the problems of the assembly line.\\" Other improvements included mechanical upgrades to increase durability and quality, as well as improved standard equipment levels. By 1973, Meyers was pushing the development of the Wankel engine for installation into an AMC car within two years, possibility of going independent of GM's rotary engineering work, but he ruled out AMC producing the new engine itself. While Meyers was AMC's top product man, he was \\"given considerable, and justifiable, credit for pushing the AMX/3 project from inception through the design and prototype stages into testing.\\" A major management transition at AMC stated on 24 May 1977, then Meyers was named president and Chief Operating Officer, succeeding the retiring William Luneburg. Although, Meyers was the executive who had been against AMC's purchase of Jeep in 1970 (of which the press kept reminding him), he was now one of Jeep's biggest proponents. Meyers did not have all the powers as Luneburg because he did not report to the CEO and Chairman, Roy D. Chapin Jr., but to the vice-chairman of the board of directors, R. William McNeally, who was also a rival to be the next chairman.Hyde, pp. 227-228 Upon the retirement of Chapin on 21 October 1977, Meyers became Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. At the time, Meyers was 49 years old and became the youngest top executive in the automobile industry bringing a wealth of manufacturing experience. \\"The company was looking for a lot more than a steady hand on the tiller ‚Äî it was looking for a savior\\" but Meyers disagreed and argued that the company could survive and remain a factor in the automobile industry by abandoning its policy of head-on competition and instead focusing on and revamping its four-wheel-drive vehicles, a market segment left untended by the large automakers, and by acquiring advanced technology. For fiscal 1977, AMC's profits more than doubled compared to the previous year to a record $83.9 million on sales of $3.1 billion. The smallest U.S. automaker saw its car sales increase 37%, while they dropped 21% for the industry as a whole.. Meyers described AMC strategy as a \\"three-legged stool\\" of small cars, Jeeps, and steady government and military contracts. By 1979, the automaker's management team headed by Meyers, ... \\"sharply cut back its money-losing car operations ... The perennially ailing baby of the auto industry suddenly looks healthy, and its new management team has a clear design for the future.\\" In 1979, Meyers formed a partnership with the French state-owned Renault, which bought 22.5 percent of AMC stock. However, the U.S. economy continued to decline through 1981, and AMC now held on to only two percent of the domestic market and lost about $300 million during the previous two years. Meyers had acknowledged that AMC had no hope of raising the $6 billion it needed to finance more competitive products, stating \\"It would take dough that just isn't in the cards for us,\\" so the company staked its future on help from Renault, which included development of the Renault Alliance sub-compact for production in Kenosha, Wisconsin. In early 1982, AMC asked its 16,000 hourly workers for wage concessions that would save the automaker $150 million. At age 53, Meyers retired from the company in February 1982, by which time Renault controlled 46 percent of American Motors. He was with the automaker 20 years and was noted for orchestrating \\"the complicated linkup between AMC and Renault starting in 1979.\\" Meyers was succeeded as chairman by former AMC President W. Paul Tippett Jr. At the time, Tippett was a member of AMC management for only three years. Retirement Meyers was the Ford Distinguished Research Chair and Professor of Business at Carnegie Mellon University's Graduate School of Industrial Administration. He has written a book about business crisis management and co-authored another. Meyers is now a business consultant and public speaker with expertise in the auto industry and business administration. He is also a Visiting Professor of Organizational Behavior at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business in Ann Arbor. He is President of Gerald C. Meyers Associates, a management consulting firm that assists and advises senior corporate officers. An expert in corporate governance and crisis management, he is also a commentator on the automobile industry. On 17 April 2007, he received an honorary degree, doctorate of business practice, from Carnegie Mellon University. Author Gerald C. Meyers wrote When It Hits the Fan, Managing the Nine Crises of Business, published by Houghton-Mifflin. He also co-authored Dealers, Healers, Brutes & Saviors, Eight Winning Styles for Solving Giant Business Crises with his daughter, Susan Meyers, published by John Wiley & Sons in 2000.

The Budva Riviera (Serbian and Montenegrin: –ë—É–¥–≤–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∞ –†–∏–≤–∏—ò–µ—Ä–∞, Budvanska Rivijera) is a long strip of the Adriatic coast surrounding the town of Budva in western Montenegro. It is part of the Montenegrin Littoral geographical region. It is located roughly along the middle of the Montenegrin coast, and is a center for Montenegrin beach tourism. There are of beaches which lie along the Budva Riviera. Settlements The best known and most popular settlements along the Budva Riviera are: * Budva * Beƒçiƒái * Miloƒçer * Rafailoviƒái * Sveti Stefan * Petrovac Beaches The best known feature of the Budva Riviera is its beaches. They are listed here, from north to south. Trsteno Trsteno (–¢—Ä—Å—Ç–µ–Ω–æ) beach is long, deeply pulled in the dry land. It has perhaps the finest sand on the Budva Riviera. It is accessible by the same road which leads to Jaz beach. Ploƒçe The stony beach of Ploƒçe (–ü–ª–æ—á–µ), from the beach Trsteno, is another attractive place for swimming(–ü–ª–æ—á–µ). The water is pure, with clarity exceeding . Ploƒçe has many facilities, including cafes, restaurants, parking spaces, sun umbrellas and swimming pools for adults and children. Jaz Jaz Beach. Jaz (–à–∞–∑) beach lies with Mrƒçevo Polje and its hinterlands. The beach is away from Budva in the direction of Tivat. It consists of two parts, one long and the other, formerly a nudist beach, long. It is a pebble beach, with a campground along the greater part of the beach (capacity 2,000 lots). The beach is a protected natural heritage site. It hosted a show of The Rolling Stones on 9 July 2007, as a part of their A Bigger Bang Tour. Mogren Mogren Beach in April. Mogren (–ú–æ–≥—Ä–µ–Ω) consists of two sandy beaches of total length of , connected with a rock tunnel. Mogren is surrounded by nature and has fine sand on the beach and in the water. The beach is well exposed to sun and southerly wind. From the back, it is protected by Spas Hill, which is covered in dense pine and oak woods. The beach is accessible by a narrow path along the sea about from Budva's old town. Mogren is named after the Spanish sailor Mogrini, who landed on the beaches after a shipwreck, As a sign of gratitude, he built St. Anthony's church. On the narrow path which leads to the beach, there is one section completely dedicated to divers and risk takers. Almost at the half point of the path, there is a little outlet into the sea, sandwiched between rocks, giving risk takers about of width to dive safely into the water. This area is called by people from Budva, Kanal, which has no meaning but in English it means literally Canal. These divers have built up quite a reputation in Budva because of their rambunctious and hilarious acts. Slovenska Slovenska Beach. Slovenska (–°–ª–æ–≤–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∞) beach stretches from the Budva marina to the Park hotel, in total length. It was declared a beach from as early as 1920, and the Slovenian architect who designed this part of the town gave it its present name Slovenska Pla≈æa (–°–ª–æ–≤–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∞ –ü–ª–∞–∂–∞, 'Slovenian beach'). It is a pebble beach, and has a large hotel complex of the same name at its rear. Budva's main promenade, where most of the nightlife and shopping takes place, goes alongside this beach. Guvance Guvance (–ì—É–≤–∞–Ω—Ü–µ) is a small sandy beach located below the walking path near the tunnel leading to Beƒçiƒái. It is long. Beƒçiƒái Beƒçiƒái Beach. Beƒçiƒái (–ë–µ—á–∏—õ–∏) beach is one of the largest and most beautiful beaches in the South Adriatic. It is a sandy beach, long and stretches from Zavala to Djevi≈°tenje. In 1935 it won the \\"Grand Prix\\" in Paris as the most beautiful beach in Europe. It is perhaps the best equipped beach on the riviera, with sport fields and all other amenities. Kamenovo Kamenovo (–ö–∞–º–µ–Ω–æ–≤–æ) beach is the first in a series of 16 smaller beaches lying between the town of Beƒçiƒái and \\"Peraziƒáa do\\". It faces southwest and has a large number of hours of sunshine. This long sandy beach is easily accessible from the main road towards Petrovac. Pr≈æno Pr≈æno (–ü—Ä–∂–Ω–æ) beach is located in front of the picturesque Mediterranean settlement of the same name. It stretches for between Pr≈æno cape and Miloƒçer cape. It is surrounded by olive groves of exceptional value, which is why the entire area is enlisted as a protected nature reserve. In the vicinity of the beach is \\"Maestral hotel\\", and a string of taverns and cafes. Miloƒçer Miloƒçer (–ú–∏–ª–æ—á–µ—Ä) beach is located near the former summer residence of the royal family Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá, built in 1934. The beach is long, surrounded by woods covering the area of 18 ha, with rare exotic tree species like the Lebanon Cedar, tropical mimosas, loquats, cacti, agavas and others. Miloƒçer beach belongs to high category of sandy beaches. Kraljiƒçina Beach Kraljiƒçina Kraljiƒçina (–ö—Ä–∞—ô–∏—á–∏–Ω–∞, translated as Queen's) beach is located next to Miloƒçer beach. It is a long beach surrounded by cypress and olive trees. Its name derives from the fact that it was a favourite spot of and was owned by Queen Marija Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá. The communist regime in 1945. nationalized Karaƒëorƒëeviƒáes' property which they purchased and developed in the 1920s and 1930s. This beach may not be open to the general public at all times, or its entrance may be charged, because this is the favourite resort of Montenegrin officials. Sveti Stefan The beaches of Sveti Stefan (–°–≤–µ—Ç–∏ –°—Ç–µ—Ñ–∞–Ω) are formed on both sides of the strip that connects the town-hotel of Sveti Stefan with the coast. Those are two sandy beaches of total length. Onde side is reserved for famous guests of this deluxe hotel. Drobni Pijesak Drobni Pijesak (–î—Ä–æ–±–Ω–∏ –ü–∏—ò–µ—Å–∞–∫) is a secluded long beach and is accessible only from the sea. It has the appearance of a real tropical beach.jar Peraziƒáa Do Peraziƒáa Do (–ü–µ—Ä–∞–∑–∏—õ–∞ –î–æ) beach is in immediate vicinity of Re≈æeviƒái monastery, below the highway. This little sandy beach is hidden in a deep valley. Petrovac Petrovac (–ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ü) beach is a sandy beach of some of length, with the sand of reddish colour. The beach is bordered by Petrovac promenade, filled with cafes, restaurants and shops. Luƒçice Luƒçice (–õ—É—á–∏—Ü–µ) is a popular beach located some south from town of Petrovac. This sandy beach is shaped like a little bay, and is long. Buljarica Buljarica (–ë—É—ô–∞—Ä–∏—Ü–∞) is possibly the greatest development potential along the Montenegrin coast. Buljarica field and the slopes of Dubovica hill are well suited for the development of all types of tourism. Buljarica cove stretches from \\"Resovo brdo\\" cove to Dubovica, and is a largest beach of the Budva Riviera. It is 1 km from Petrovac in the direction of Bar, and is long. Sveti Nikola island Sveti Nikola (St. Nicolas) The Sveti Nikola island is the main excursion site in the Budva area. The island has three sandy beaches whose combined length is . The island itself is about one km away from Budva. There are many small beaches around the island, accessible only by boat.

INC was formed in 1871 with the backing of the Pennsylvania Railroad to operate foreign flagged vessels on transatlantic routes to Philadelphia. Clement Griscom, the company's general manager, entered into an agreement with the Belgian Government to establish the Red Star Line to operate a mail service out of Antwerp to Philadelphia and New York. This subsidiary would provide most of the company's profits for the next 30 years. In 1873, Griscom also took over the management of the American Steamship Company, a Philadelphia-based passenger and cargo service to Liverpool that was also backed by the Pennsylvania Railroad. This company, known as the American ‚ÄúKeystone‚Äù Line was unprofitable because of the substantially higher costs associated with operating American-flagged vessels. In 1884, the assets of the American Line were acquired by International Navigation. Two years later, INC also acquired the assets of the financially troubled Inman Line, operator of a British flagged Liverpool-New York mail service. With PRR's backing, Griscom ordered two record breakers to restore Inman's fortunes. However, the British Government objected to Inman's ownership change and revoked Imman's mail contract. Griscom successfully lobbied Congress to reflag the two new express liners and qualify for an American mail subsidy. In 1893, Inman was merged the American Line and the company built two additional express liners in the US to create a premium weekly service, now routed to Southampton. Griscom believed that the major lines should be merged to control capacity and avoid rate wars. In 1899, he became acquainted with J. P. Morgan, an investment banker who was responsible for many of the large mergers during the period. With financing from Morgan's syndicate, in 1902 Griscom and Morgan expanded International Navigation by acquiring the Atlantic Transport Line, the Leyland Line, the White Star Line, the Dominion Line and half of Holland America. International Navigation was renamed International Mercantile Marine (IMM). However, Griscom and Morgan paid too high a price for the companies they acquired and IMM struggled under the debt payments. Management was reorganized to focus on White Star, the most profitable subsidiary. In 1915, IMM was forced into bankruptcy when the war disrupted cash flow, but later was able to profit from the wartime demand for shipping. In the 1920s and 1930s, IMM gradually sold off its foreign subsidiaries. In 1931, it acquired the United States Lines, and merged all operations under that name in 1943. The company failed in 1986 and was liquidated when it over expanded in the cargo container business. 1871-84 Clement A. Griscom (1841 - 1912): Longtime President of International Navigation In 1858, the Inman Line abandoned Philadelphia as its American terminus and switched its operations to New York. Various interests in Philadelphia, including the Pennsylvania Railroad, recognized the need to reestablish steamship service directly to Europe. In 1870, PRR backed the creation of two shipping companies, the US-flagged American Steamship Company and the foreign flagged International Navigation Company. Chartered on May 5, 1871, International Navigation was created by the Philadelphia ship brokerage of Peter Wright & Sons. A $1 million bond issue was guaranteed by PRR and the initial $1.5 million stock offering was largely purchased by a small group of Peter Wright partners and PRR executives. The new firm's affairs were turned over to a 30-year-old Peter Wright partner, Clement A. Griscom, who was also a close associate of Edgar Thompson, President of PRR. International Navigation's original plan was to operate UK flagged steamers on the Liverpool-Philadelphia route and to coordinate sailings with the American Steamship Company, operating as the American ‚ÄúKeystone‚Äù Line. Since Peter Wright & Sons was also involved in the early transport of oil from the Pennsylvania petroleum fields, Griscom had the support of the Standard Oil Company for his new steamship line. INC ordered its first steamer as a combined passenger ship/tanker, but she probably only carried oil on one voyage after it was realized that the fire hazard with tankers was too great to also carry passengers on the same ship. In 1872, Griscom and Thompson concluded that International Navigation should seek a terminus on the continent. According to his son, Griscom marked all of the principle manufacturing towns in England, Belgium, France and Germany and determined that the center was Antwerp Belgium. Griscom immediately left for Europe and met with Antwerp officials about the necessary improvements to modernize the old port into the terminus for a steamship line. When he was told that Leopold II must also approve, Griscom left for Brussels where he received the King's strong support including a postal subsidy and port improvements. On September 27, 1872, the Red Star Line was chartered in Belgium as the ‚ÄúSociete Anonyme de Navigation Belge-Americaine‚Äù. In addition to Griscom, the board included Thomas Scott, who in two years would become President of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Red Star's Antwerp-Philadelphia Service started in January 1873. Red Star took delivery of three new steamers built in England and supplemented its fleet with chartered tonnage. Red Star was in better position to survive the depression of 1873 than the US-flagged American ‚ÄúKeystone‚Äù Line because operating as a US carrier resulted in about 30% higher costs. At the end of 1873, Griscom took over management of the American Keystone Line. In 1874, Red Star also started an Antwerp-New York service under a mail contract from the Belgian Government. Red Star thrived and by 1881 carried over 40,000 passengers. At the same time, the American Keystone Line was not profitable because of its higher cost structure. When the hoped for subsidy never came from Congress, PRR decided to reorganize American Steamship. In 1884, PRR offered to purchase 14,500 new shares in International Navigation for $725,000 to finance INC's purchase of American Steamship's four vessels as well as its name and good will. The money never actually left PRR's account because it was used to repay the railroad for the American Steamship bonds it guaranteed. When the transaction was completed, the American Keystone Line became INC's second operating subsidiary. 1884-93 International Navigation's Liverpool agent was Richardson and Spence, who was also the agent for the Inman Line, one of the big three British flagged companies on the Liverpool-New York route. INC became a major creditor of Inman when that company suffered financial difficulties in the early 1880s. In 1886, with the backing of the Pennsylvania Railroad, Griscom offered ¬£205,000 for Inman's five liners and name. Under the deal, Griscom was able to deduct the debt owed INC from the purchase price. With no real alternative, Inman's directors accepted the offer. Griscom's first record breaker, City of New York Griscom realized that the renamed Inman and International Line required a new express steamer to compete against its rivals, the Cunard Line and White Star. He sailed for Europe with a commitment of $2 million from the Pennsylvania Railroad to finance the new ship. Scottish shipbuilders were suffering a depression at the time and offered to build two liners at the bargain price of $1,850,000 apiece. The PRR agreed and Griscom ordered what were to become the two largest and fastest ships on the Atlantic, the 20 knot City of New York and City of Paris. He also ordered a large new liner for Red Star, the Friesland. The intent was to continue Inman as a British-flagged company. However, considerable opposition developed over Inman's change in ownership, and the British Government transferred Inman's mail contract to the Guion Line. Under the Postal Aid Act of 1891, the US Government offered to pay $12,500 per round-trip voyage to any American-flagged carrier offering 20-knot steamship service to the UK. However, this amount was not sufficient to attract firms to acquire the liners required under the act, and Griscom's two new 20-knot Atlantic speedsters could not qualify, because they were built in the UK. Therefore, Griscom and the Pennsylvania Railroad lobbied Congress to allow the reflagging of Inman's two record-breakers. Griscom also offered to build a second pair of 20-knot liners in a US yard so that Inman would have the four ships required for a weekly service. In May 1892, Congress enacted the necessary legislation. Five months later, the post office department agreed to contract with INC for a weekly New York-Southampton mail service. On February 22, 1893, President Benjamin Harrison personally raised the American flag on the newly renamed New York, and the Inman and International Line was officially merged into the American Line. 1893-1902 The American Line's St. Louis To strengthen the company's finances, International Navigation was reorganized in June 1893. The original Pennsylvania chartered company was replaced by a new corporate entity, the International Navigation Corporation of New Jersey with capitalization of $15 million. In July, International Navigation Limited was formed in the UK to hold title to the remaining British flagged vessels. The company was also refinanced with a $6 million bond issue to enable Griscom to order the two new 20 knot express liners required under the US mail contract and additional new vessels for Red Star. About half of these bonds were purchased by representatives of Standard Oil. When St Louis and St Paul were delivered, the American Line had the only weekly 20 knot service on the Atlantic. The timing for the company's expansion could not have been worse. The major shipping companies including the American Line entered into an agreement to control sailing frequency and prices. However, the agreement broke down in the fall of 1893 over a dispute between the German and British lines over Scandinavian business, resulting in a fare war. This situation was compounded by the depression of 1894 and several weaker firms including the Guion Line collapsed. By 1896, economic conditions improved and the major lines reached a new agreement, negotiated at International Navigation's headquarters in London. The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War (1898) and the Boer War (1899-1902) created a shortage of shipping on the Atlantic, and the major lines launched building programs in increase their fleets. Most of the American Line's ships were requisitioned by the government for war service. Griscom also ordered new vessels and after the war refinanced the company. In 1899, J.P. Morgan underwrote $20 million in 5% bonds. $12 million was used to retire existing 6% bonds and $6 million was earmarked for expansion. By 1902, International Navigation's fleet consisted of 26 ships totaling 181,000 tons and carried more passengers than either Cunard or White Star. While International Navigation's Belgian and British subsidiaries were consistently profitable, the American Line only paid its first dividend in 1900. The mail contract of $750,000 per year was not sufficient to offset the higher costs of operating US-flagged vessels. Griscom was a close associate of Ohio Senator Marcus Hanna, who stayed at Griscom's house outside Philadelphia during the 1900 Republican convention. Hanna was the power broker behind President William McKinley, and when the Republicans were reelected, Hanna pushed a new mail subsidy bill. The legislation cleared the Senate in 1902, but stalled in the House of Representatives. Congress was opposed to subsidizing rich financiers even though this meant that relatively fewer Americans were employed as merchant ship builders and sailors. As early as the 1880s, Griscom believed that the major shipping lines should be combined into a trust to control capacity and pricing. As a result of the 1899 refinancing, he became acquainted with J. P. Morgan, the investment banker who was successful in putting together large trusts. Morgan was then in the process of building U.S. Steel, the first billion dollar corporation. Morgan profited from the investment fees associated with creating or refinancing companies, but not actually operating the new enterprises. The timing appeared right for a large shipping merger. In 1902, another price war broke out when the Boer War ended and new vessels entered service. Backed by financing from Morgan's syndicate, Morgan and Griscom acquired the Atlantic Transport Line, the Leyland Line, the White Star Line, the Dominion Line and half of Holland America. When combined with International Navigation, the new company owned 118 ships totaling 810,000 tons. This represented 20% of the total shipping on the Atlantic and a third of the passenger business. They also entered into revenue sharing arrangements with Hamburg America and North German Lloyd. On October 1, 1902, Morgan and Griscom announced that International Navigation was to be reorganized as the International Mercantile Marine Corporation of New Jersey and that the firm had an initial capitalization of $120 million plus the proceeds of a $50 million bond offering. The old International Navigation was valued at $14.2 million including $2.5 million in cash and stock paid as commissions to Griscom and his close associates. Postscript J.P. Morgan, photographed by Edward Steichen in 1903 By the end of 1903, the value of the IMM preferred stock dropped from $85 to $18 and the bonds were not selling. Morgan was unable to sell much of the stock and bonds issued to finance IMM and was forced to remain active in IMM's management. Instead of the $10 million profit he expected, he lost money on the transaction. The problem was that IMM paid too much for the companies it acquired and struggled under the debt payments. The hoped for subsidy from Congress did not materialize and the company was impacted by the economic depression that lasted through the middle of the decade. Further, the anticipated economies of scale from the merger did not materialize. In 1904, management was reorganized and IMM focused on White Star, the most profitable subsidiary. However, by 1915 the company was forced into bankruptcy court when IMM was unable to make debt service payments because the war disrupted cash flow from foreign subsidiaries. IMM survived and by 1917 profited from the demand for shipping during W.W.I. During the 1920s and 30s, IMM sold its foreign flagged subsidiaries to focus on US operations. In 1930, the Roosevelt Steamship Company purchased 51% of IMM. The next year, Roosevelt IMM became the manager of the government owned United States Lines when the line's purchaser defaulted on the payments. In 1934, Roosevelt IMM acquired a majority of the US Line stock for $1.1 million. All US Line, Roosevelt Line and IMM operations were merged in 1943 and the combined operation used the US Line name. The US Line emerged from the war as one of the largest international shippers and in the 1950s was the second largest transatlantic passenger carrier after Cunard. Passenger sailings were terminated in 1969 when the US government withdrew the operating subsidy for the United States. The US Lines failed in 1986 when it over expanded in the container cargo business and its operations were liquidated. The shell of United States Lines emerged from bankruptcy in 1990 and eventually entered into the hotel business and is now known as Janus Hotels & Resorts.

In 1880 they moved to Kansas City and started the Star. At the time there were three daily competitors ‚Äì the Evening Mail; The Kansas City Times; and the Kansas City Journal. Nelson took over sole ownership of the paper within a few months. Nelson's business strategy called for cheap advance subscriptions and an intention to be ‚Äúabsolutely independent in politics, aiming to deal by all men and all parties with impartiality and fearlessness.‚Äù He purchased the Kansas City Evening Mail and its Associated Press franchise in 1882 and started the Weekly Kansas City Star in 1890 and the Sunday Kansas City Star in 1894. Nelson bought the Times in 1901 putting ‚ÄúThe Morning Kansas City Star‚Äù on it. Nelson had portraits of Tilden, Grover Cleveland, and Theodore Roosevelt in his office and was a crusading editor. Roosevelt stayed with Nelson at Oak Hall. In one encounter, Kansas City Mayor Joseph J.

The farm's mission was the development of improved breeding methods and livestock. It served as one of the world's leaders in animal health for more than 30 years. He campaigned for Kansas City‚Äôs George Kessler-designed park and boulevard system and the 1900 ‚ÄúKansas City Spirit‚Äù to build Convention Hall in 90 days in order to host the 1900 Democratic National Convention after the original (and new) convention hall had burned in April 1900. Nelson provided in his will that following the death of his wife and daughter his Oak Hill mansion be torn down and its estate turned into an art museum. Proceeds from his $6 million estate were used to build the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City. Nelson's will also established a trust for Sni A Bar Farm, with Presidents from the University of Missouri, the University of Kansas, and the University of Oklahoma charged with selecting its trustees. The Art Gallery originally contained a recreation of Nelson's oak paneled room from Oak Hall (and namesake of the estate). The room contained Nelson's red plush easy chair and bookcases.

It sits at 295 West Ave., in Mathews Park, where the Stepping Stones Museum for Children is also located. History=As private home Railroad and banking magnate LeGrand Lockwood The home was built on an estate, then called \\"Elm Park,\\" for LeGrand Lockwood, who made his fortune in banking and the railroad industry. Construction began in 1864 just west of the Norwalk River in Norwalk and was completed four years later. Designed by European-trained, New York- based architect Detlef Lienau, the mansion features of living space and \\"is considered his most significant surviving work,\\" according to the association. Both American and immigrant artisans worked to construct and decorate the house. Prominent New York decorating firms, including Herter Brothers and Leon Marcotte were contracted to furnish the mansion's interiors. Financial reversals in 1869 and Lockwood's death in 1872 resulted in loss of the estate through foreclosure in 1874 by Lockwood's heirs. Charles D. Mathews, described in his New York Times obituary as \\"a very wealthy retired New-York provision dealer\\", and his wife, Rebecca Thompson Mathews, bought the property in 1876. The mansion was a residence and suburban retreat for the Mathews family, with their Thompson and Martin relatives, until the death of Charles's daughter Florence in 1938. As museum East side of the home seen from the south, showing porte-cochere and greenhouse Built in 1864-68, the home is an early example of the style used by wealthy New York City elites such as the Vanderbilts in building their Gilded Age mansions later in the 19th century, and set a new standard for opulence. In 1941 the estate was sold to the City of Norwalk, which designated it a public park. The city had planned in 1959 \\"to build a city hall in the park and tear down the mansion to make way for it.\\" Considerable controversy and claims of bad faith ensued, leaving the building threatened with demolition. Local preservationists formed Lockwood‚ÄìMathews Mansion Museum, Inc. to run the site. The Junior League of Stamford-Norwalk eventually led a late 1960s restoration, supported by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the American Institute of Architects, the National Park Service, and the Connecticut Historical Commission. and The home was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1971. According to the museum organization's Web site, the museum's mission \\"is to conserve the building while creating educational programs on the material, artistic and social culture of the Victorian era,\\" . A master plan for a more comprehensive restoration of the mansion was expected to be completed in 2007. Plans for renovation work at the museum include adding an elevator, and systems for heating, air conditioning, and sprinklers. Renovation costs are likely to total about $6 million, museum officials said in May 2007, before the master plan was complete.Stelloh, Tom, \\"Museum will get an upgrade\\", article in The Advocate (Stamford) of Stamford (Norwalk Edition), pp A7, A8, May 15, 2007 In a decades-long Christmastime tradition, interior decorators deck out about a dozen rooms in the mansion with holiday decorations.

In the 2000s, statues and furniture that had originally been in the mansion were bought and placed back in it. Two marble statues, sculpted in 1859 by Joseph Mozier, an American artist, and bought by Lockwood, were purchased for $185,000. A $165,000 sofa original to the home was also acquired and brought back to it.Breslow, Matt, \\"Mansion director out of work after filing complaint\\", news article in The Advocate of Stamford, Norwalk edition, page 1, March 26, 2007 The home was used as a filming location for the 2004 remake of The Stepford Wives. Paramount Pictures paid the museum $400,000 to paint its central rotunda. The studio also left behind some large paintings (in essence, theatrical pastiches), which serve to emphasize the dramatic size of the rotunda. As a result, the walls look fresh and decorated, and will remain protected until further funds become available for proper, curatorial restoration of the original damaged surfaces.

It has rostral and caudal subdivisions. * The rostral aspect of the dorsal raphe is further divided into interfascicular, ventral, ventrolateral and dorsal subnuclei. * The projections of the dorsal raphe have been found to vary topographically, and thus the subnuclei differ in their projections. An increased number of cells in the lateral aspects of the dorsal raphe is characteristic of humans and other primates. Serotonin The dorsal raphe is the largest serotonergic nucleus and provides a substantial proportion of the serotonin innervation to the forebrain. Serotonergic neurons are found throughout the dorsal raphe nucleus and tend to be larger than other cells. A substantial population of cells synthesizing substance P are found in the rostral aspects, many of these co-express serotonin and substance P. There is also a population of catecholamine synthesizing neurons in the rostral dorsal raphe, and these cells appear to be relatively large. The dorsal raphe nucleus is rich in pre-synaptic serotonin 5-HT1A autoreceptors, and it's believed that the action of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in this region is responsible for the latency of their antidepressant effect. Projections Ten percent of the axons from the nucleus raphe dorsalis of the rat have been shown to project to the amygdala, while only medium cells seem to project to the caudate and putamen and olfactory bulb. Role in naloxone-induced morphine withdrawal The nucleus raphes dorsalis has also been implicated in naloxone-induced morphine withdrawal. It is known that endogenous opioid receptors exist on the nucleus raphes dorsalis, and that it is a focal point as an ascending and descending regulator. Pourshanazari et al. showed in their 2000 paper that electrical stimulation of the nucleus raphes dorsalis can partially alleviate morphine withdrawal symptoms via electrical stimulation of the raphe nucleus in question. These are fascinating results; however no control was provided for the spread of electrical charge to other parts of the brain stem. It is quite possible that the charge spread to the nucleus raphes magnus and induced analgesia upon the rats. Knowing that the spread of charge across such a short area is very plausible, as is an alternate connection to the raphe magnus, these results could be called into question. Role in narcolepsy Wu M.F. et al. studied the nucleus raphes dorsalis as it pertained to narcolepsy. This is logical, as the raphe nuclei have been known to play a role in the sleep/wake cycle. Cataplexy is the symptom of narcolepsy when full awareness of the environment is maintained, but all muscle tone is lost. This has thought to be a dissociation of what normally happens during REM sleep, when all muscle tone is lost except for the eyes. The nucleus raphes dorsalis have been known to project to the lateral hypothalamus, along with the locus coeruleus and the tuberomammillary nucleus. The neurotransmitters of these three aforementioned nuclei, which project to the lateral hypothalamus, are serotonin, norepinephrine and histamine respectively. These neurotransmitters are fully active during waking hours, partially active during non-REM sleep, and have almost ceased during REM sleep. In cats with pontine lesions, their normal atonia is not present, the raphe dorsalis is fully active, as opposed to the cessation of action under normal conditions. A muscle relaxant, known as Mephenesin, reduces activity of the dorsal nucleus, as well as microinjections of carbachol (which induces atonia while awake). Role in depression and suicide The rostral raphe nuclei, both the median raphe nucleus and particularly the dorsal raphe nucleus have long been implicated in depression. Some studies have suggested that the dorsal raphe may be decreased in size in people with depression and, paradoxically, an increased cell density in those who die by suicide.

The Median Raphe Nucleus is a part of the Raphe Nucleus. The median raphe nucleus (MRN or MnR), also known as the nucleus raphes medianus (NRM)Federative Committee on Anatomical Terminology (FCAT) (1998). Terminologia Anatomica. Stuttgart: Thieme or superior central nucleus, is a brain region composed of polygonal, fusiform, and piriform neurons, which exists rostral to the nucleus raphes pontis. The MRN is located between the posterior end of the superior cerebellar peduncles and the V. Afferents of the motor nucleus. It is one of two nuclei, the other being the dorsal raphe nucleus (DnR), in the midbrain- pons. The MRN projects extensively to the hippocampus, which is known to be essential for the formation of long-term memory. One recent study found that this raphe‚Äìhippocampus pathway plays a critical role in regulation of hippocampal activity and likely associated memory consolidation processes. It has also been found to play a role in anxiety and depression, as one of the few parts of the brain that creates tryptophan hydroxylase.  Description  The median raphe nucleus contains 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5-HT) cell bodies that give rise to the majority of the ascending 5-HT projections to the forebrain limbic areas that control emotional behavior. Because a dense population of neurons in the median raphe nucleus primarily contain serotonin, a prominent neurotransmitter in the median raphe nucleus is serotonin (5-HT). Projections from the MRN extend to forebrain structures. Distinct projection areas of the MnR innervates the medial septum, cingulate and dorsal hippocampus. According to a study by McKenna and Vertes, around 8‚Äì12% of cells of the MnR were retrogradely double-labeled after paired injections in the Medial septum CA1 region, Medial Septum CA3 region, Medial Septum Dentate Gyrus of the dorsal hippocampus, the lateral Medial Septum Dentate Gyrus, and the Medial Septum ventral hippocampus. These cells of the MnR that send collateral projections to the Medial Septum and hippocampus may serve a unique role in modulation of desynchronization of hippocampus EEG. Also, the MnR has significantly more single- and double-labeled cells after paired injections to the various Medial Septum and hippocampus regions than in DnR which demonstrate that MnR has more stronger projections to the Medial Septum and hippocampus than the DnR. MnR fibers are course and large with spherical varicosities. Neurotoxic 5-HT-releasing agents selectively destroy DnR projection fibers without affecting the dense coarse fibers from the MnR. Most of the fibers that distribute to the medial septum terminate selectively within the medial septum-vertical limb of the diagonal band nucleus (MS/DBv) and lateral aspects of lateral septum. Most of the pronounced projections to hippocampal formation (HF) distribute to the stratum lacunosum-molecular of Ammon‚Äôs horn and granule cell layer and adjacent inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (DG). Projections stemming from the MRN modulate dopaminergic activity within the forebrain. Additionally MnR projections are part of a behavioral disinhibition/inhibition system that produces phenotypes resembling behavioral variations manifested during manic and depressive phases of bipolar disorder. Inhibition of the MRN in cats by lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocin, two serotonin agonist hallucinogens, leads to dose dependent behavioral changes, indicating the MRN may be an important site of action for humans hallucinations.Trulson, M.E., Preussler DW and Trulson V.M.

One recent study found that this raphe‚Äìhippocampus pathway plays a critical role in regulation of hippocampal activity and likely associated memory consolidation processes.4\\\\. Wang, D.V., Yau, H., Broker, C.J., Tsou, J., Bonci, A. & Ikemoto, S. Mesopontine median raphe regulates hippocampal ripple oscillation and memory consolidation. Nature Neuroscience 18, 728-735, 2015 It has been shown that the MRN is a contributor of serotonergic agents, especially 5-HT to the hippocampus. These findings, together with the demonstration that serotonergic agents block Long Term Potentiation (LTP) and 5-HT antagonists enhance LTP and/or memory makes it clear that the MRN plays a part in formation of long term memory in the hippocampus. The MRN was found to play a vital role in hippocampal desynchronization; it exerts an inhibitory effect on the mechanism for hippocampal theta wave generation. Also, median raphe nucleus suppresses theta bursts of the medial septal area neurons. Numerous studies reveal that lesions in the MRN continuously caused ongoing theta activity, and when the MRN was injected with pharmacological agents, the neurons displayed inhibited activity or reduced excitatory to drive them to produce theta at short latencies and for long durations. Therefore, MRN is a functional antagonist of the reticular formation which plays a critical role in hippocampal theta generation.  Function  The MRN plays a role in the serotonin pathway. According to the study by Van De Kar and Lorens, it is the main source of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) to other parts of the brain. 5-HT is another name for serotonin which is a neurotransmitter that is affected by many physical and emotional processes, including depression, mood, social functioning, exercise, and diet. The MRN, when stimulated, significantly increases the amount of 5-HT present in the brain. This aided in forming the conclusion that the neurons in the MRN is the main contributor of 5-HT to the dorsal hippocampus as well as anterior and posterior cortical areas. Furthermore, the MRN was found to an area in the brain that relates to inhibitory control by GABA of serotonin (5-HT). The gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) acts an inhibitory transmitter‚Äìwhen GABA antagonist were injected in the median raphe nucleus of rat, it was found that there was increase in serotonin turnover. Such relationship is also seen in when the MRN is electrically stimulated and as a result behavioral inhibition is induced in rats. These behaviors that are typically seen in rats during stressful situations involved crouching, teeth chattering, piloerection, and micturition. When the MRN is electrically stimulated, the behavioral response was not only suppressed but there was a counteraction with para- chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), a serotonin synthesis inhibitor. Such results demonstrate that the MRN is involved in behavioral inhibition as well. Another function of the MRN is that it plays a role in depression. It has been discovered that the MRN is one of the few parts of the brain that creates tryptophan hydroxylase. Tryptophan hydroxylase is a rate-limiting enzyme that works with serotonin. When the levels of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 mRNA are elevated then more tryptophan hydroxylase is created. These elevated levels are associated with individuals who present as depressed suicides when compared to the nonpsychiatric controls. Besides depression, MRN has been examined for its potential role in anxiety regulation. In examining the MRN, various animal models have shown that an inactivation of neurons containing the serotonin transmitter within the median raphe nucleus led to anxiolysis. Anxiolysis refers to medications or drugs, for example, that results in a calm and relaxed state; it can be used to relieve anxiety or as a sedative. Such relationship suggest that the MRN plays a regulatory function in anxiety.  Research  The use of microdialysis and voltammetry in studies has indicated that neurotransmitter-mediated responses may be different, and chronic treatment with agonists may differentially regulate the MnR and DnR. Results from these studies have demonstrated the selective vulnerability of MnR or DnR.

Philadelphia/London/Toronto/Montreal/Sydney/Tokyo: W.B. Saunders Company.), is located directly rostral to the nucleus raphe obscurus, and receives input from the spinal cord and cerebellum. This makes the nucleus raphe magnus a likely candidate for part of the motor system; however, it seems to participate in the endogenous analgesia system. Mounting evidence suggests that the nucleus raphe magnus plays an important role in homeostatic regulation.Hellman, Kevin et al. Activity of murine magnus raphe cells predicts tachypnea and on-going nociceptive responsiveness. Journal of Neurophysiology Volume 98, Issue 6, December 2007, Pages 3121-33.Hellman, Kevin et al., Opioid microinjection into raphe magnus modulates cardiorespiratory function in mice and rats. American Journal of Physiology Regulator Integratory Comp Physiology. Volume 297, Issue 5, November 2009, Pages R1400-8. The nucleus raphe magnus receives descending afferents from the periaqueductal grey matter (PAG), the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, central nucleus of the amygdala, lateral hypothalamic area, parvocellular reticular nucleus and the prelimbic, infralimbic, medial and lateral precentral cortices.Hermann, Dirk M. et al. Afferent projections to the rat nuclei raphe magnus, raphe pallidus and reticularis gigantocellularis pars demonstrated by iontophoretic application of choleratoxin (subunit b). Journal of Chemical Neuroanatomy Volume 13, Issue 1, June 1997, Pages 1-21 All of these brain areas influence the main function of the nucleus raphe magnus. The main function of the nucleus raphe magnus is mostly pain mediation; in fact it sends projections to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord to directly inhibit pain. The nucleus raphe magnus releases serotonin when stimulated. Raphe- spinal neurons project to enkephalin releasing interneurons in the posterior horn of the spinal cord.Haines, Duane E., and M. D. Ard. Fundamental Neuroscience for Basic and Clinical Applications. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier/Saunders, 2013. The periaqueductal grey matter, an area of the brain involved in mediating analgesia, sends efferent connections to the nucleus raphe magnus when it is stimulated by opiates (endogenous or otherwise). Electrical stimulation of the PAG produces analgesia, as well as administration of morphine to the PAG or nucleus raphe magnus. The antinociceptic effects of electrical stimulation of the PAG can be blocked by administering naloxone, an opiate antagonist, to the nucleus raphe magnus. Similarly, afferent fibres from the spinothalamic tract synapse at the periaqueductal grey matter. This in turn is linked to the nucleus raphe magnus, which when stimulated directly inhibits pain fibers in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, thus alleviating pain. All of this seems to indicate that the nucleus raphe magnus is part of the endogenous opiate system, and acts to inhibit pain in the spinal cord.

The nucleus raphes obscurus projects to the cerebellar lobes VI and VII and to crus II along with the nucleus raphe pontis. The nucleus raphes obscurus has also been implicated in the modulation of the hypoglossal nerve. It has been observed that the ablation of this nucleus causes a change in the firing pattern of this cranial nerve. In addition, the nucleus raphe obscurus mediates expiration via the effect of serotonin and depresses periodic synaptic potentials. It has also been shown that this nucleus stimulates gastrointestinal motor function; microinjections of 5-HT into the nucleus raphe obscurus increase gastric movement.

After Robinson Ekspeditionen, Biker-Jens gained a lot of local fame, and made several travel programs for Danish TV Danmark and TV3+. Biker Jens' travel documentaries from the United States, the Far East and Australia are the most re-run TV-series ever broadcast in Denmark. Biker Jens in the United States His most famous show, Biker Jens in the USA, is a travel documentary series, where he rode a Harley-Davidson motorcycle from Key West, Florida, to San Francisco, California. During the 3¬Ω month ride he experienced the extremes as well as everyday life in the States. He tried everything from alligator-wrestling to gatecrashing a Ku Klux Klan meeting, while also meeting a handful of Danes living in America and having successful careers, such as NFL kicker Morten Andersen, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich, and actor/stuntman Sven-Ole Thorsen. The show became the No. 1 show on TV Danmark in late 1999, and he signed a new contract with the TV channel to make two more travel documentary series, that would take place in Asia and Australia. They were both filmed and aired in 2000. After driving 45,000 km on Harley-Davidsons within 1¬Ω years, Romundstad started a career as team builder, but then later returned to the screen to host the Danish version of Fear Factor, filmed in South Africa in 2002. In 2003 he went back to the US for TV3 to film the series Biker Jens - A Life on the Edge, where he examined extreme lifestyles, not only describing it, but actually living the life himself, as a stunt driver, male stripper, human cannonball, pro wrestler, rodeo cowboy, bullfighter, rapper, freediver and a homeless person. He was injured several times during the filming, but was later awarded the \\"Brigitte Bardot International Award\\" at the Humane Society of the United States' \\"Genesis Award\\" Ceremony in 2003, for the episode about bullfighting in Mexico.

It encompasses 6,070 square kilometers (1.5 million acres) and is administered by the United States Forest Service. The Forest Service's \\"mixed use\\" policy allows for its use for recreation, grazing, and resource extraction. Geography Wheeler Peak, the highest mountain in New Mexico at , is located in the National Forest. The forest is located mainly in Rio Arriba (63.4% of acreage) and Taos (34.65%) counties, but smaller areas extend eastward into western Mora and Colfax counties. Wildlife Big game animals roam this forest. They include mule deer, elk, pronghorn, black bears, coyotes, bobcats, foxes, cougars, and bighorn sheep. There are also many species of smaller mammals and songbirds. Forest personnel work closely with the State Game and Fish Department to provide the best wildlife habitat possible. Carson has four hundred miles of sparkling clean mountain streams and numerous lakes. Many of them are stocked with native trout by the Game and Fish Department. History The forest was once inhabited by the Ancestral Pueblo people, who left ruins of adobe dwellings and other artifacts at an archaeological site now called Pot Creek Cultural Site. Some areas of the forest were formerly lands granted to settlers by the Spanish monarchy and the Mexican government. After the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the national forest was established, and was named for American pioneer Kit Carson. Carson National Forest was established with the merger of Taos National Forest and part of Jemez National Forest on July 1, 1908. Included in the merged lands was the land surrounding Blue Lake, an important cultural, religious site to the Tao Indians. In the early 20th century, the Taos Indians petitioned the federal government to regain Blue Lake, but their requests were denied. Attempts to prevent Taos ceremonies at Blue Lake were included in the government's attempts to assimilate Indigenous peoples into mainstream settler culture. The Department of Agriculture therefore denied requests to set aside land at Blue Lake for the Taos Indians to perform ceremonies, claiming that it was \\"foreign to the policies of the Department of Agriculture, when once some land has been set aside as a National Forest, to allow it to be withdrawn completely and donated to a private purpose.\\" In 1965, the Association on American Indian Affairs published a booklet called The Blue Lake Appeal in order to garner support for requests to return Blue Lake through the Indian Claims Commission (ICC). The ICC then concluded that the Taos Indians' land had been illegally obtained and no proper amends had been made to rectify it, suggesting a monetary award as compensation. The Taos Indians refused a monetary settlement, leading to a deliberation in Congress to return Blue Lake back to the tribe. When the bill was deadlocked in Congress, the Taos Pueblo brought their case to President Richard Nixon, who pushed their request through Congress in 1970, returning the Blue Lake to Taos Pueblo. In October 1966, the Alianza Federal de Mercedes, an organization dedicated to the restoration of certain land grants entrenched in the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo to descendants of then-Mexican citizens, occupied the Carson Forest's Echo Amphitheater in an attempt to create a land grant community. The occupants were evicted, after five days, for overstaying camping permits. In 1982, the forest grew by 405 square kilometers (100,000 acres) when the Pennzoil corporation donated the Valle Vidal Unit to the American people. Wilderness areas Within the Carson National Forest are five designated and one proposed wilderness areas.

The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. Thames & Hudson. 2004. Her father was a Satrap of Dascylium under Artaxerxes III and Darius III, and a Satrap of Bactria under Alexander. Her mother was most likely the only known wife of Artabazus, an anonymous sister of the Rhodian generals Memnon and Mentor, who were in Persian service in the late 340 BCs and the 330 BCs.Artabazus on www.livius.com Artakama married Ptolemy (then a general) in April 324 BC at a marriage festival in the city of Susa, as ordered by Alexander the Great. Many of the Macedonian and Greek officers took Persian wives shortly afterward. Artakama was not mentioned in historical texts again, probably because Ptolemy quietly discarded her when he left Babylon for Egypt after Alexander's death. If so, his action was a contrast to that of his friend Seleucus, whose Persian wife, Apama, married also on that occasion, remained with him permanently. Seleucus and Apama became the ancestors of the kings of the Seleucid dynasty and, through a future dynastic marriage, of the last rulers of the Ptolmaic dynasty.Translation of Anabasis by the Greek author Arrian of Nicomedia at www.livius.com Artakama is called Apama by Plutarch, but this is likely an error.

It is an alternative to the state pension. Usually individuals invest funds into saving schemes or mutual funds, run by insurance companies. Often private pensions are also run by the employer and are called occupational pensions. The contributions into private pension schemes are usually tax-deductible. This is similar to the regular pension.  History  The first evidence of pension payments comes from the Roman Empire in the 1st century BC, but beginnings of private pensions go back to the 19th century. The first private pension plan in the USA was created in 1875 by the American Express Co. But the growth of people coveraged by private pensions was relatively slow. In 1950, only 25 percent of employees in nonagricultural field were anticipated in some private pension system.  Situation in the 21st century  Nowadays, governments of developed countries have reduced the amount of money for providing pension security. As a consequence, employer-sponsored and individual products become more popular. Most of these private pensions types are connected with financial markets, which brings some risks and uncertainty. For example, it can be the time difference between the date of conclusion the contract and income stream in the future or very low rate of return if we decide to invest our money into low-risk financial instruments (savings products). Usually, three-pillar pension system is introduced. The first pillar is related to state pensions, the second one to supplementary pensions and the third one to voluntary individual (private) pensions.  Private pensions in the USA  One of the most used private pensions is Defined Contribution Plan. Each participant has his or her own individual account. Contributions are made to this account by an employer of a participant as a part of his or her wage. Each participant chooses some mutual funds, stocks or other securities to invest this amount of money. The return of this investment is continuously credited or deducted from individual's account. Money in this plan cannot be withdraw without penalty until the participant's retirement age. Another possibility in the USA is Defined Benefit Plan. This plan pays some amount of money at the time of retirement regardless the age of a participant. A monthly benefit depends on number of years worked, salary at the time of retirement and accrual rate. Defined Benefit Plan can be funded or unfunded. In a funded plan, the special fund for investing contributions of employers and participants is created. The return of investment is changeable, so there are not any guarantees of some level of future income. In an unfunded plan, there are no funds for paying benefits. The benefits to be paid are met by contributions to the plan or by some assets.  Private pensions in the UK  In the UK, there are two main possibilities how to ensure additional money to the State Pension. Firstly, it is a workplace pension. In this case, the plan of savings for retirement is arranged by an employer. Part of your salary is automatically paid into the pension scheme every payday. The second possibility of private retirement savings is use of a personal pension. This type of pension is arranged by insured themselves. There are two types of personal pension ‚Äì the stakeholder pension where is required meeting some government limits and self-invested personal pensions where participants make decisions themselves about investment in their pension fund. Both types of private pensions share similar features. The amount of money the participants get in retirement depends on how much they have paid in, how long they have had the private pension, their health condition and how well the pension fund's investments have done. Moreover, tax relieves are provided to private pension participants.  Private pensions in Germany  In Germany, there are two private pensions plans ‚Äì Riester Rente and R√ºrup Rente. They both follow the strategy of German government to reduce state-guaranteed pensions. This plans were designed to provide certain groups of residents with some benefits depending on their employment, economic situation and status. Riester Rente is designated for people who pay German income and wage taxes, employees who contributes to Public Retirement Insurance, civil servants and more. It is necessary to contribute at least 60 euros per year to get government subsidies. For gaining the maximal government support is required to paid at least 4% of participant's annual income. It is possible to save at most 2,100 euros per year. The amount of government subsidies is between 154 euros and 300 euros depending on fulfilling some conditions. This plan is regulated by the German Government. The participant have to be at least 60 years old to draw money back. All money you contribute to the pension system is guaranteed. R√ºrup Rente is primarily designated for people with high tax burden, but everyone can take part in. There are no government subsidies. On the other side, considerable tax relieves are connected with this plan. R√ºrup Rente provides lifelong pension which is guaranteed. The pension payment cannot start before reaching the age of 62.  Private pensions in France  There are two occupational mandatory supplementary plans ‚Äì ARRCO (Association des r√©gimes de retraites compl√©mentaires) for executive workers and AGIRC (Association gen√©rale de institutions des retraires des cadres) for non-executive workers where employees and employers have to contribute. If the participant do not contribute all the time, their pension rates are lower. The benefits can be paid out from the age of 60, usually as annuities. Next, there are two voluntary pensions schemes ‚Äì Funded occupational pension plan ‚Äì PERCO (Plan d‚Äô√©pargne retraite) and Individual retirement savings plan - PERP (Plan d‚Äô√©pargne retraite populaire). In PERCO, employers have to offer several investment funds to employees with different portfolios. Employees can save at most one quarter of their gross annual salary. For employers, it is compulsory to contribute, but the minimum amount is not established. The maximum amount saved in a year horizon is 5,149 euros in total of employer's and employee's contributions. It is not possible use the money before retirement. Contributions made by employees subject to income tax, but return of investment and retirement benefits not. PERP is form of individual pension contributions which provides additional income in a retirement. The conditions of frequency and amount depend on pension insurance plan. Insurer is obliged to guarantee progressive increase of minimal level of benefits. Usually, benefits are paid out as annuities, but lump sum is also possible. Participating in PERP has also a tax benefit, because amount of money deposit to this scheme is tax-deductible up to 10% of your last year income.

It harvests data on malware, spam, bots, and botnets using large-scale sensor networks of honeypots and honeyclients placed throughout the world. It uses sinkholes to collect data on bots and DDOS attacks. It also receives additional malware and sinkhole data from governments, industry partners, and law enforcement agencies that have established reciprocal data- sharing agreements with Shadowserver.  Data analysis  Shadowserver stores raw malware data permanently in its repository. As new data are collected, Shadowserver analyzes them using thousands of virtual sandboxes and hundreds of iron sandboxes. It regularly re-analyzes raw data previously collected. The results of these analyses are stored in the organization's analysis cluster.  Network reporting  Shadowserver sends free daily network reports to users who have subscribed to them. The reports contain all the data that Shadowserver has collected and analyzed about any suspicious activity it was able to detect within the specific networks or regions for which the subscriber is responsible. For example, a national government might receive data aggregated by geo-spatial coordinates defined by latitude and longitude, while an international network provider might receive data filtered by ASN.  Investigation support  Shadowserver liaises with security organizations, national governments, and CSIRTs to dismantle global cybercrime networks; for example, it worked with the FBI, Europol, and Interpol to take down the Avalanche network in 2016.

Despite not being the capital of the Dobrzy≈Ñ Land, Lipno became the region's most important centre and the seat of the sejmik of the Dobrzy≈Ñ Land. The town was annexed by Prussia in the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, in 1807 it became part of the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw and in 1815 it became part of so-called Congress Poland in the Russian Partition. Many inhabitants took part in the unsuccessful November and January Uprisings against Russia, after which Lipno was subject to severe persecutions. Nevertheless, local Poles founded various organisations. Lipno became part of independent Poland again, when the coutry proclaimed independence on 11 November 1918, afterwards the town's cultural life was revived. Memorial to Polish soldiers fallen in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War During the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, the town was briefly occupied by the Soviets from 13‚Äì14 August 1920.Miros≈Çaw Krajewski, Ziemia dobrzy≈Ñska w cieniu Czerwonej Gwiazdy.

Lipno was liberated by Poles on 20 August 1920.Krajewski, p. 57 A monument to local Polish soldiers fallen in the war was erected in 1930.Krajewski, p. 121 In 1924, Zygmunt Uzarowicz, a former Polish independence activist in the Russian Partition of Poland, became the mayor of the town, and held office until the German invasion of Poland in 1939. During the invasion of Poland, which started World War II, the town was raided by the Germans on 2 September 1939 and captured on 8 September. During the German occupation, Poles were subject to mass arrests, expulsions and executions. A prison for Poles was established in the town.Maria Wardzy≈Ñska, By≈Ç rok 1939. Operacja niemieckiej policji bezpiecze≈Ñstwa w Polsce. Intelligenzaktion, IPN, Warszawa, 2009, p. 111 (in Polish) In October 1939, the Germans carried out mass arrests of Polish teachers and landowners from Lipno and surrounding villages, deceitfully gathering them to Lipno for alleged conferences on town matters.Wardzy≈Ñska, p. 171, 175-176 71 teachers and several dozen landowners were arrested, imprisoned in concentration and forced labour camps, and mostly later murdered.Wardzy≈Ñska, p. 175-177 Also 20 priests were arrested and imprisoned in the Stutthof concentration camp, where 13 of whom died. Around 200 Poles and Jews from Lipno and surrounding villages were murdered in the forest near Karnkowo.Wardzy≈Ñska, p. 175 Next mass arrests of Poles were carried out in April 1940. 10 Poles were murdered in a public execution at the market square on 3 November 1940. The pre-war mayor Zygmunt Uzarowicz was arrested and imprisoned in GrudziƒÖdz in 1940, and then deported to the Dachau and Buchenwald concentration camps, where he was beaten to death by the Germans in 1942. In addition, about 3,300 Poles were expelled from the Lipno County, and Jews were deported to Nazi ghettos, however Poles managed to create an underground resistance movement. In 1939, the Germans destroyed the Polish monument from 1930.Krajewski, p. 122 It was rebuilt in 1992. Sports The local football team is , which competes in the lower leagues.

The program takes advantage of a range of proxy servers called Dynaweb. This allows users to bypass Internet firewalls that block web sites by using DIT's Peer-to-peer (P2P)-like proxy network system. FreeGate's anti-censorship capability is further enhanced by a new, unique encryption and compression algorithm in the versions of 6.33 and above. Dynamic Internet Technology estimates Freegate had 200,000 users in 2004. The maintainer and CEO of DIT is Bill Xia.  Dynaweb  DynaWeb is a collection of anti- censorship services provided by Dynamic Internet Technology Inc. (DIT). DynaWeb is a web-based anti-censorship portal. Once users point their web browser at one of the DynaWeb URLs, a web page will be presented similar to the original, with most blocked websites as links. In addition, a user can type in any URL in the box on this page and DynaWeb will fetch the pages for him or her instantly. No software is needed, nor are any settings tweaked on a user‚Äôs computer. Since the Chinese net police watch DynaWeb‚Äôs portal websites closely and block them as soon as they identify them, DynaWeb must be dynamic. It has hundreds of mirror sites at any time, and each with a varying IP and DNS domain names to defeat IP blocking and DNS hijacking. On the backend, DynaWeb also has mechanisms to proactively monitor the blocking status of each of its mirror sites, and as soon as blocking is detected, it will change the IP and DNS domain name instantly. To keep users connected to such a dynamic infrastructure, DynaWeb has a variety of channels to keep users updated. For example, a user can send a message to one of DynaWeb‚Äôs instant messenger (IM) accounts, and will get an instant reply showing the newest addresses of DynaWeb portals. Similar things are being done with emails. By these many, dynamic channels, DynaWeb outsmarts any attempt to collect all DynaWeb addresses by the censors, because each user receives only a (different) subset of DynaWeb‚Äôs addresses. Automatic blocking detection combined with quick reaction apparently frustrates the blocking efforts on the China side of the Great Firewall of China (GFW). DIT also releases a tiny piece of software, FreeGate, which directly taps into DynaWeb‚Äôs backbone and keeps a user connected to the dynamic channels automatically. There are indications that FreeGate has some capabilities built-in to exploit some zero-day vulnerabilities of the GFW. Today DynaWeb offers the widest range of options for users to access Internet freely, and supports more than 50 million web hits per day on average from Chinese users alone.  Creation and funding  DIT was founded in 2001 to provide email delivery services to China for US government agencies and NGOs. In 2002, DIT started to provide anti-censorship services under the framework of DynaWeb, and like UltraSurf, DynaWeb became a top contender of the GFW-penetration effort. Freegate was created by Falun Gong practitioners and has been financed by the Broadcasting Board of Governors, a US governmental agency.Geoffrey A. Fowler: ‚ÄúChinese Censors of Internet Face ‚ÄòHacktivists‚Äô in US‚Äù. In: Wall Street Journal, 14 February 2006. Freegate also receives funding from Human Rights in China, which is also one of its clients and which receives some funding from the American non-profit organization the National Endowment for Democracy. According to a CRS report, the US government gave funding of $685,000 to Freegate in 2005.  Malware reports  In 2004, the Financial Times, citing a member of staff at Symantec in mainland China, reported that Norton AntiVirus identified Freegate as a Trojan horse. There were initial fears that the reports may be a ploy by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) authorities to encourage removal of the software from computers, but it was soon delisted as a threat. Symantec explained that its detection was based on the software operating similarly to various Trojan horses, based on the use of proxies to penetrate firewalls used to block web sites, but that it had modified its detection to exclude Freegate. In 2013, it was reported that 'pro-government electronic actors' in Syria sent electronic messages to rebels encouraging them to download a file named Freegate which was claimed to be designed to help dissidents circumvent state surveillance agencies, but actually it was a malware and the intruder was able to monitor what the victim was typing on their computer, and read or remove the victim's files. In August 2013 while Freegate was testing a new proxy program, some people thought it was a phishing attack. Reports from Iran said the users who used Freegate to pass Internet censorship in Iran, were led to a fake page instead of Facebook's main website. Freegate published a note saying they were testing a new proxy program, and the fake Facebook page was a tunnel. Although IT experts warned users to be careful with the tunnel link because it doesn't use SSL security so users' information is not encrypted.

(also known as KAMB) is an independently published role- playing game from 9th Level Games, a small-press publisher and designer of humorous role-playing games (RPGs) based in Pennsylvania. The name is a derivative reference to the Azaria Chamberlain disappearance and the famous misquote, \\"A dingo ate my baby!\\". The Super Deluxx Edition was still designed by 9th Level Games but is published by Dork Storm Press. Game play The players assume the roles of kobolds, creatures who are often used as weak but numerous \\"cannon fodder\\" characters in fantasy role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons. KAMB supposedly refutes this role, while at the same time playing up this and other stereotypes of fantasy role-playing. The game takes a generally humorous look at the genre and encourages joking and ludicrous, boisterous behavior among the players, the chief of which is the rule that whenever the name of the kobolds' king, Torg (All Hail King Torg!), is mentioned, all present are required to loudly proclaim, \\"ALL HAIL KING TORG!\\" KAMB is played using the dice rolling mechanism called the Beer Engine. It is called Beer after the four stats that make each character: Brawn, Ego, Extraneous, and Reflexes. Essentially, players are given a difficulty in numbers of dice, and they must roll under the appropriate value on their sheet. Kobolds being poorly suited to adventuring have low numbers, which keeps the humour alive in the game. KAMB is part of an annual event at the Origins Game Fair called the Midnight Massacre, in which large numbers of people customarily play multiple simultaneous games of KAMB and make significant amounts of noise. In 2005, the Midnight Massacre was staged as a LARP. BEER Engine The BEER Engine! is a role-playing game system created by 9th Level Games for Kobolds Ate My Baby! and other games. This is the basic engine used to determine if a character succeeds at an action they have attempted in the game. In BEER Engine games, all characters have statistics that represent their physical and mental aptitudes. (i.e. strength, reflexes, or smarts) These statistics are determined by rolling a number of dice when the character is created with higher results representing a greater proficiency in a particular area. While playing the game characters will attempt certain feats (like climbing a wall). To determine whether the action is successful or not the player rolls a number of six-sided dice. The number of dice that are rolled increases with the difficulty of the action; if the total of the dice rolled by the player is less than or equal to their character's statistic the action succeeds. Other RPGs using the BEER Engine! are Ninja Burger, Warhamster. 9th Level Games The \\"Super Deluxx Edition\\" features illustrations by John Kovalic. The company was founded by Dan Landis and Chris O'Neill while in high school together. As of 2001, the company had four employees, including the founders. 9LG's first games were Adventure! The W¬∏rlde of Kroson and In the Company of Rats, introduced at Origins 1999; these was followed by KAMB, developed in one month for Gen Con 1999. Currently, 9th Level Games is transitioning out publishing to focus primarily on design. In December 2005, Dork Storm Press (DSP) released Kobolds Ate My Baby! Super Deluxx Edition, a game that was designed by 9LG and published by DSP. This edition features illustrations by John Kovalic, the creator of Dork Tower. On March 4, 2013, 9th Level initiated a 30-day Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for a new printing of KAMB. Aiming for a pledge target of $11,000, the fundraiser earned $65,817 in total, meeting and exceeding all \\"stretch goals\\" for the fundraiser, including a related printing of a Munchkin booster pack based on the game.Kickstarter for 2013 Reprint of KAMB Reviews and awards KAMB has received many industry and independent accolades. The publication Games Quarterly listed KAMB as one of the top 10 funniest games (non- electronic) released in the last few years. Similarly KAMB was chosen as one of \\"the 50 Funniest Games of All Time\\" and the \\"Weirdest RPG Ever\\" by Inquest Magazine. Reviewer, author and critic Ken Hite said in his review that he \\"loved it\\" and praised its humor and solid game mechanic. A reviewer on RPGnet review site called it \\"a game of comic genius\\" and gave it 5 stars out of 5 for both style and substance. Reviewer Matthew Pook said that \\"the game itself is amusingly written, and of course, it includes opportunities aplenty for the Mayor [the Gamemaster] to be rotten to his Kobold players. Just as they will be rotten to each other in the scramble to gain Victory Points. In this, it shares some similarity with Paranoia.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:Fictional kobolds Category:Indie role-playing games Category:Comedy role-playing games Category:Role-playing games introduced in 1999 ","title":"Kobolds Ate My Baby!"},{"id":"4469392","text":"Sofar may refer to: * Sofar bomb (SOund Fixing And Ranging bomb), a long-range position-fixing system that uses explosive sounds in the deep sound channel of the ocean * SOFAR channel (SOund Fixing And Ranging channel), a horizontal layer of water in the ocean centered on the depth at which the speed of sound is minimum * Sofar Sounds, music events company See also * Shofar, a musical instrument * Sawfar, a village in Lebanon ","title":"Sofar"},{"id":"4469399","text":"Paradisus batavus by Paul Hermann, Leyden, 2nd Edn. 1705 Paul Hermann (30 June 1646, Halle ‚Äì 29 January 1695, Leiden) was a German-born physician and botanist who for 15 years as director of the Hortus Botanicus Leiden. Born in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, Paul Hermann was the son of Johann Hermann, a well-known organist, and Maria Magdalena R√∂ber, a clergyman's daughter. Hermann studied theology and medicine in Wittenberg and botany in Leipzig. After graduating from Europe's finest medical school, Padua in 1670, he was then engaged by the Dutch East India Company and went to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) as a Ship's Medical Officer. He was in their employ from 1672 to 1677. During his stay there, he made a scientific collection of this island's plants and other organisms. He was then offered the job at Leiden and took up the Chair of Botany at the University of Leiden in 1679 and took up his residence in 1680 at Leiden where he spent the rest of his professional life. He immediately set to making it the finest botanical garden in Europe. Lilium Africanum Polyanthos in Paradisus batavus, 1698 Hermann's Paradisus batavus, a description of the plants of the Leyden university botanical garden, was published three years after his death in 1698 and edited by William Sherard. There was a second edition published in 1705. Sherard edited his notes and solicited patronage for the publication of this important book. They were students together of Tournefort in Paris in 1688. This is where Hermann perfected his botanical draughtsmanship. Later Sherard collected more of his notes and produced a catalog published as Musaeum Zeylanicum (1717, 2nd edn.: 1727). Hermann's original Ceylon collection was used by Carl Linnaeus when he wrote his Flora Zeylanica (1747) and Species plantarum (1753), using the abbreviation \\"Hermann herb.\\" in those publications. After Hermann's collections had passed through many hands, they were eventually purchased by Sir Joseph Banks. Now they are kept at the Natural History Museum in London. Hermann was a very good botanical illustrator and had an excellent botanical grasp as declared by Linnaeus himself.

The mirrored current is a precise copy of the input current. It may be used as a Wilson current source by applying a constant bias current to the input branch as in Fig. 2. The circuit is named after George R. Wilson, an integrated circuit design engineer who worked for Tektronix.Sedra, A.S. & Smith, K.C.: \\"Microelectronic Circuits, 6th Ed.\\", OUP (2010), pp. 539 - 541. Wilson devised this configuration in 1967 when he and Barrie Gilbert challenged each other to find an improved current mirror overnight that would use only three transistors. Wilson won the challenge.Gilbert, B., \\"Bipolar Current Mirrors,\\" in \\"Analogue IC Design: the Current-Mode Approach,\\" Eds. Toumazou, C., Lidgey, F. J. & Haigh, D. G., Peter Peregrinus Ltd. (1990), , pp. 268-275.  Circuit operation  Figure 1: Wilson current mirror Figure 2: Wilson current source There are three principal metrics of how well a current mirror will perform as part of a larger circuit. The first measure is the static error, the difference between the input and output currents expressed as a fraction of the input current. Minimizing this difference is critical in such applications of a current mirror as the differential to single-ended output signal conversion in a differential amplifier stage because this difference controls the common mode and power supply rejection ratios. The second measure is the output impedance of the current source or equivalently its inverse, the output conductance. This impedance affects stage gain when a current source is used as an active load and affects common mode gain when the source provides the tail current of a differential pair. The last metric is the pair of minimum voltages from the common terminal, usually a power rail connection, to the input and output terminals that are required for proper operation of the circuit. These voltages affect the headroom to the power supply rails that is available for the circuitry in which the current mirror is embedded. An approximate analysis due to Gilbert shows how the Wilson current mirror works and why its static error should be very low. Transistors Q1 and Q2 in Fig. 1 are a matched pair sharing the same emitter and base potentials and therefore have \\\\scriptstyle i_{C1} ~=~ i_{C2} and \\\\scriptstyle i_{B1} ~=~ i_{B2}. This is a simple two- transistor current mirror with \\\\scriptstyle i_{E3} as its input and \\\\scriptstyle i_{C1} as its output. When a current \\\\scriptstyle i_\\\\text{in} is applied to the input node (the connection between the base of Q3 and collector of Q1), the voltage from that node to ground begins to increase. As it exceeds the voltage required to bias the emitter-base junction of Q3, Q3 acts as an emitter follower or common collector amplifier and the base voltage of Q1 and Q2 begins to rise. As this base voltage increases, current begins to flow in the collector of Q1. All increases in voltage and current stop when the sum of the collector current of Q1 and base current of Q3 exactly balance \\\\scriptstyle i_\\\\text{in}. Under this condition all three transistors have nearly equal collector currents and therefore approximately equal base currents. Let \\\\scriptstyle i_B ~=~ i_{B1} ~=~ i_{B2} ~\\\\approx~ i_{B3}. Then the collector current of Q1 is \\\\scriptstyle i_\\\\text{in} \\\\,-\\\\, i_B; the collector current of Q2 is exactly equal to that of Q1 so the emitter current of Q3 is \\\\scriptstyle i_{E3} ~=~ i_{C2} \\\\,+\\\\, 2i_B ~=~ i_\\\\text{in} \\\\,-\\\\, i_B \\\\,+\\\\, 2i_B ~=~ i_\\\\text{in} \\\\,+\\\\, i_B. The collector current of Q3 is its emitter current minus the base current so \\\\scriptstyle i_\\\\text{out} ~=~ i_\\\\text{in} \\\\,+\\\\, i_B \\\\,-\\\\, i_B ~=~ i_\\\\text{in}. In this approximation, the static error is zero.  Difference of Input and Output Currents  A more exact formal analysis shows the expected static error. We assume: # All transistors have the same current gain Œ≤. # Q1 and Q2 are matched and they share the same base-emitter voltage, so their collector currents are equal. Therefore, \\\\scriptstyle i_{C1} ~=~ i_{C2} ~\\\\equiv~ i_C and \\\\scriptstyle i_{B1} ~=~ i_{B2} ~\\\\equiv~ i_B. The base current of Q3 is given by, \\\\scriptstyle i_{B3} ~=~ \\\\frac{i_{C3}}{\\\\beta} and the emitter current by, :i_{E3} = \\\\frac{\\\\beta + 1}{\\\\beta}i_{C3} ... (1) From the sum of currents at the node shared by the emitter of Q3, the collector of Q2 and the bases of Q1 and Q2, the emitter current of Q3 must be :i_{E3} = i_{C2} + i_{B1} + i_{B2} = i_C + 2i_B = \\\\frac{\\\\beta + 2}{\\\\beta}i_C ... (2) Equating the expressions for \\\\scriptstyle i_{E3} in (1) and (2) gives: :i_C = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\beta + 1}{\\\\beta + 2} \\\\right)i_{C3} ... (3) The sum of currents at the input node implies that \\\\scriptstyle i_\\\\text{in} ~=~ i_{C1} \\\\,+\\\\, i_{B3} ~=~ i_C \\\\,+\\\\, \\\\frac{i_{C3}}{\\\\beta}. Substituting for \\\\scriptstyle i_C from (3) leads to \\\\scriptstyle i_\\\\text{in} ~=~ \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\beta \\\\,+\\\\, 1}{\\\\beta \\\\,+\\\\, 2} \\\\,+\\\\, \\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta} \\\\right)i_{C3} or \\\\scriptstyle i_{C3} ~=~ \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\beta \\\\left( \\\\beta \\\\,+\\\\, 2 \\\\right)}{\\\\beta \\\\left( \\\\beta \\\\,+\\\\, 2 \\\\right) \\\\,+\\\\, 2} \\\\right)i_\\\\text{in}. Because \\\\scriptstyle i_{C3} is the output current, the static error, the difference between the input and output currents, is :i_\\\\text{in} - i_\\\\text{out} = \\\\frac{2i_\\\\text{in}}{\\\\beta \\\\left( \\\\beta + 2 \\\\right) + 2} \\\\approx \\\\frac{2i_\\\\text{in}}{\\\\beta^2} ... (4) With NPN transistors, the current gain, \\\\scriptstyle \\\\beta , is of the order of 100, and, in principle, the mismatch is about 1:5000. For the Wilson current source of Fig. 2, the input current of the mirror is \\\\scriptstyle I_{R1} ~=~ \\\\frac{1}{R1}\\\\left( V_{CC} \\\\,-\\\\, V_{BE2} \\\\,-\\\\, V_{BE3} \\\\right). The base- emitter voltages, \\\\scriptstyle V_{BE}, are typically between 0.5 and 0.75 volts so some authors approximate this result as \\\\scriptstyle I_\\\\text{out} \\\\approx \\\\frac{V_{CC} \\\\,-\\\\, 1.4}{R1}. The output current is thus substantially dependent only on VCC and R1 and the circuit acts as a constant current source, that is, the current remains constant with variations in the impedance of the load. However, variations in VCC or changes in the value of R1 due to temperature will be reflected in variations in the output current. This method of direct generation of a reference current from the power supply using a resistor rarely has adequate stability for practical applications and more complex circuits are used to provide reference currents independent of temperature and supply voltages. Equation (4) substantially underestimates the differences between the input and output currents that are generally found in this circuit for three reasons. First, the emitter-collector voltages of the inner current mirror formed by Q1 and Q2 are not the same. Transistor Q2 is diode connected and has \\\\scriptstyle v_{CE2} ~=~ v_{BE2}, which is typically on the order of 0.6 to 0.7 volts. The collector emitter voltage of Q1 is higher by the base-emitter voltage of Q3 and therefore is about twice the value across Q2. The Early effect (base-width modulation) in Q1 will force its collector current to be slightly higher than that of Q2. This problem can be essentially eliminated by the addition of a fourth transistor, shown as Q4 in the improved Wilson current mirror of Fig. 4a. Q4 is diode connected in series with the collector of Q1, lowering its collector voltage until it is approximately equal to \\\\scriptstyle v_{CE} for Q2. Second, the Wilson current mirror is susceptible to mismatches in the current gain, \\\\scriptstyle \\\\beta, of its transistors, particularly the match between \\\\scriptstyle \\\\beta_3 and the current gains of the matched pair Q1 and Q2. Accounting for \\\\scriptstyle \\\\beta differences among all three transistors, one can show that \\\\scriptstyle i_\\\\text{in} \\\\,-\\\\, i_\\\\text{out} ~=~ \\\\frac{2\\\\left( \\\\overline{\\\\beta_{12}} \\\\,-\\\\, \\\\beta_3 \\\\right) \\\\,+\\\\, 2}{\\\\overline{\\\\beta_{12}}\\\\beta_3 \\\\,+\\\\, 2\\\\overline{\\\\beta_{12}} \\\\,+\\\\, 2} where \\\\scriptstyle \\\\overline{\\\\beta_{12}} is the Harmonic Mean of the current gains of Q1 and Q2 or \\\\scriptstyle \\\\overline{\\\\beta_{12}} ~=~ 2\\\\left[ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta_1} \\\\,+\\\\, \\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta_2} \\\\right]^{-1}. Beta mismatches of five percent or more are reported to be common, causing an order of magnitude increase in the static error. Finally, the collector current in a bipolar transistor for low and moderate emitter currents conforms closely to the relation \\\\scriptstyle i_C ~=~ I_{SC}\\\\exp \\\\left( \\\\frac{v_{BE}}{V_T} \\\\right) where \\\\scriptstyle V_T ~=~ \\\\frac{kT}{q} is the thermal voltage and \\\\scriptstyle I_{SC} is a constant dependent on temperature, doping concentrations, and collector-emitter voltage. Matched currents in transistors Q1 and Q2 depend on conformity to the same equation but observed mismatches in \\\\scriptstyle I_{SC} are geometry dependent and range from \\\\scriptstyle \\\\pm 1\\\\text{ to }\\\\pm 10 percent. Such differences between Q1 and Q2 lead directly to static errors of the same percentage for the entire mirror. Careful layout and transistor design must be used to minimize this source of error. For example, Q1 and Q2 may each be implemented as a pair of paralleled transistors arranged as a cross-coupled quad in a common-centric layout to reduce effects of local gradients in current gain. If the mirror is to be used at a fixed bias level, matching resistors in the emitters of this pair can transfer some of the matching problem from the transistors to those resistors.  Input and Output Impedances and Frequency Response  Figure 3: Small-signal model for impedance calculation A circuit is a current source only to the extent that its output current is independent of its output voltage. In the circuits of Figures 1 and 2, the output voltage of importance is the potential from the collector of Q3 to ground. The measure of that independence is the output impedance of the circuit, the ratio of a change in output voltage to the change in current it causes. Figure 3 shows a small signal model of a Wilson current mirror drawn with a test voltage source, \\\\scriptstyle v_\\\\text{test}, attached to the output. The output impedance is the ratio: \\\\scriptstyle z_\\\\text{out} ~\\\\equiv~ \\\\frac{v_\\\\text{test}}{i_\\\\text{test}}. At low frequency this ratio is real and represents an output resistance. In Fig. 3, transistors Q1 and Q2 are shown as forming a standard two-transistor current mirror. It is sufficient for calculating the output impedance to assume that the output current of this current mirror subcircuit, \\\\scriptstyle i_{c1}, is equal to the input current, \\\\scriptstyle i_{e3}, or \\\\scriptstyle i_{c1} ~\\\\approx~ i_{e3}. Transistor Q3 is represented by its low-frequency hybrid-pi model with a current controlled dependent current source for the collector current. The sum of currents at the emitter node of Q3 implies that: :i_\\\\text{test} = i_{e3} + i_{c1} = 2i_{c1}\\\\text{ or }i_{c1} = \\\\frac{1}{2}i_\\\\text{test} ... (5) Because the dynamic resistance of the diode-connected transistor Q2, the input resistance of the two-transistor current mirror, is much smaller than \\\\scriptstyle r_{O3}, the test voltage, \\\\scriptstyle v_\\\\text{test}, effectively appears across the collector-emitter terminals of Q3. The base current of Q3 is \\\\scriptstyle i_{b3} ~=~ -i_{c1}. Using equation (5) for \\\\scriptstyle i_{c1}, the sum of currents at the collector node of Q3 becomes \\\\scriptstyle i_\\\\text{test} ~=~ \\\\frac{v_\\\\text{test}}{r_{O3}} \\\\,-\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{2}i_\\\\text{test}. Solving for the output impedance gives: :z_\\\\text{out} = \\\\frac{v_\\\\text{test}}{i_\\\\text{test}} = \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{2} \\\\right)r_{O3} \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{2}r_{O3} ... (6) In a standard two-transistor current mirror, the output impedance would be the dynamic Early resistance of the output transistor, the equivalent of which in this case is \\\\scriptstyle r_{O3}. The Wilson current mirror has an output impedance that is higher by the factor \\\\scriptstyle \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{2}, on the order of 50X. The input impedance of a current mirror is the ratio of the change in input voltage (the potential from the input terminal to ground in Figures 1 and 2) to the change in input current that causes it. Since the change in output current is very nearly equal to any change in input current, the change in the base-emitter voltage of Q3 is \\\\scriptstyle \\\\Delta V_{BE3} ~=~ \\\\frac{\\\\Delta I_\\\\text{in}}{g_{m3}}. Equation (3) shows that the collector of Q2 changes by nearly the same amount, so \\\\scriptstyle \\\\Delta V_{BE2} ~\\\\approx~ \\\\frac{\\\\Delta I_\\\\text{in}}{g_{m2}}. The input voltage is the sum of the base-emitter voltages of Q2 and Q3; the collector currents of Q2 and Q3 are nearly equal implying that \\\\scriptstyle g_{m2} ~=~ g_{m3}. The input impedance is \\\\scriptstyle z_\\\\text{in} ~=~ \\\\frac{2}{g_{m3}}. Using the standard formula for \\\\scriptstyle g_m ~=~ \\\\frac{I_C}{V_T} leads to: :z_\\\\text{in} = \\\\frac{2kT}{qI_\\\\text{in}} ... (7) where \\\\scriptstyle \\\\frac{kT}{q} = V_T is the usual thermal voltage, the product of Boltzmann's constant and absolute temperature divided by the charge of an electron. This impedance is twice the value of \\\\scriptstyle z_\\\\text{in} for the standard two-transistor current mirror. Current mirrors are frequently used in the signal path of an integrated circuit, for example, for differential to single-ended signal conversion within an operational amplifier. At low bias currents, the impedances in the circuit are high enough that the effect of frequency may be dominated by device and parasitic capacitances shunting the input and output nodes to ground, lowering the input and output impedances. The collector-base capacitance, \\\\scriptstyle C_{\\\\mu 3}, of Q3 is one component of that capacitive load. The collector of Q3 is the output node of the mirror and its base is the input node. When any current flows in \\\\scriptstyle C_{\\\\mu 3}, that current becomes an input to the mirror and the current is doubled at the output. Effectively the contribution from Q3 to the total output capacitance is \\\\scriptstyle 2C_{\\\\mu 3}. If the output of the Wilson mirror is connected to a relatively high impedance node, the voltage gain of the mirror may be high. In that case the input impedance of the mirror may be affected by the Miller Effect because of \\\\scriptstyle C_{\\\\mu 3}, although the low input impedance of the mirror mitigates this effect. When the circuit is biased at higher currents that maximize the frequency response of the transistor current gain, it is possible to operate a Wilson current mirror with satisfactory results at frequencies up to approximately one tenth of the transition frequency of the transistors. The transition frequency of a bipolar transistor, \\\\scriptstyle f_T, is the frequency at which the short-circuit common-emitter current gain falls to unity. It is effectively the highest frequency for which a transistor may supply useful gain in an amplifier. The transition frequency is a function of the collector current, increasing with increasing current until a broad maximum at a collector current slightly less than what causes the onset of high injection. In simple models of the bipolar transistor when the collector is grounded, \\\\scriptstyle \\\\beta \\\\left( f \\\\right) shows a single-pole frequency response so \\\\scriptstyle f_T is also the current gain-bandwidth product. Crudely this implies that at \\\\scriptstyle \\\\frac{f_T}{10}, \\\\scriptstyle \\\\beta \\\\left( \\\\frac{f_T}{10} \\\\right) ~\\\\approx~ -j10. By equation (4) one might expect the magnitude of the ratio of output to input current at that frequency to differ from unity by about 2%. The Wilson current mirror achieves the high output impedance of equation (6) by negative feedback rather than by emitter degeneration as cascoded mirrors or sources with resistor degeneration do. The node impedance of the only internal node of the mirror, the node at the emitter of Q3 and the collector of Q2, is quite low. At low frequency, that impedance is given by \\\\scriptstyle \\\\frac{V_T}{\\\\beta I_\\\\text{in}} ~=~ \\\\frac{kT}{q\\\\beta I_\\\\text{in}}. For a device biased at 1 mA having a current gain of 100, this evaluates to 0.26 ohms at 25 deg. C. Any change in output current with output voltage results in a change in the emitter current of Q3 but very little change in the emitter node voltage. The change in \\\\scriptstyle i_{E3} is fed back through Q2 and Q1 to the input node where it changes the base current of Q3 in a way that reduces the net change in output current, thus closing the feedback loop. Circuits that contain negative feedback loops, whether current or voltage loops, with loop gains near or above unity may exhibit undesirable anomalies in frequency response when the phase shift of the signal inside the loop is sufficient to convert negative into positive feedback. For the current feedback loop of the Wilson current mirror this effect appears as a strong broad resonant peak in the ratio of the output to input current, \\\\scriptstyle H_{WCM}\\\\left( s \\\\right) ~\\\\equiv~ \\\\frac{i_\\\\text{out}\\\\left( s \\\\right)}{i_\\\\text{in}\\\\left( s \\\\right)}, at about \\\\scriptstyle \\\\frac{f_T}{3}. Gilbert shows a simulation of a Wilson current mirror implemented in NPN transistors with \\\\scriptstyle f_T ~=~ 3.0 GHz and current gain \\\\scriptstyle \\\\beta ~=~ 100 that shows a peak of 7.5 dB \\\\scriptstyle \\\\left( \\\\left H_{WCM}\\\\left( s \\\\right) \\\\right ~=~ 2.4 \\\\right) at 1.2 GHz. This behavior is very undesirable and can be largely eliminated by further modification of the basic mirror circuit. Figure 4b show a possible variant on the Wilson mirror that reduces this peak by disconnecting the bases of Q1 and Q2 from the collector of Q2 and adding a second emitter to Q3 to drive the bases of the internal mirror. For the same bias conditions and device type, this circuit exhibits flat frequency response to 50 MHz, has a peak response less than 0.7 dB \\\\scriptstyle \\\\left( \\\\left H_{WCM}\\\\left( s \\\\right) \\\\right ~=~ 1.08 \\\\right) at 160 MHz and falls below its low-frequency response at 350 MHz.  Minimum Operating Voltages  The compliance of a current source, that is, the range of output voltage over which the output current remains approximately constant, affects the potentials available to bias and operate the circuitry in which the source is embedded. For example, in Fig. 2 the voltage available to the \\"Load\\" is the difference between the supply voltage \\\\scriptstyle V_{CC} and the collector voltage of Q3. The collector of Q3 is the output node of the mirror and the potential of that collector relative to ground is the output voltage of the mirror, that is, \\\\scriptstyle v_\\\\text{mirror out} ~=~ v_{BE2} \\\\,+\\\\, v_{CE3} and the \\"load\\" voltage is \\\\scriptstyle V_{CC} \\\\,-\\\\, v_\\\\text{mirror out}. The \\"load\\" voltage range is maximized at the minimum \\\\scriptstyle v_\\\\text{mirror out}. Also, when a current mirror source is used as an active load for one stage of a system, the input to the next stage is often directly connected between the source output node and the same power rail as the mirror. This may require that the minimum \\\\scriptstyle v_\\\\text{mirror out} be kept as small as possible to simplify biasing the succeeding stage and to make it possible to turn that stage fully off under transient or overdrive conditions. The minimum output voltage of the Wilson current mirror must exceed the base emitter voltage of Q2 by enough that Q3 will operate in active mode rather than saturation. Gilbert reports data on a representative implementation of a Wilson current mirror that showed constant output current for an output voltage as low as 880 millivolts. Since the circuit was biased for high frequency operation (\\\\scriptstyle V_{BE} ~\\\\ge~ 0.7), this represents a saturation voltage for Q3 of 0.1 to 0.2 volts. By contrast, the standard two-transistor mirror operates down to the saturation voltage of its output transistor. The input voltage of the Wilson current mirror is \\\\scriptstyle v_\\\\text{in} = v_{BE2} + v_{BE3}. The input node is a low impedance node so its voltage remains approximately constant during operation at \\\\scriptstyle 2V_{BE} \\\\approx 1.4 volts. The equivalent voltage for the standard two-transistor mirror is only one base- emitter drop, \\\\scriptstyle V_{BE}, or half that of the Wilson mirror. The headroom (the potential difference between the opposite power rail and the input of the mirror) available to the circuitry that generates the input current to the mirror is the difference of the power supply voltage and the mirror input voltage. The higher input voltage and higher minimum output voltage of the Wilson current mirror configuration may become problematic for circuits with low supply voltages, particularly supply voltages less than three volts as are sometimes found in battery powered devices.  A Four- Transistor Improved Mirror  Figure 4a) Four transistor Wilson current mirror; 4b) Variant that removes peak in high-frequency response. Adding a fourth transistor to the Wilson current mirror as in Fig. 4a equalizes the collector voltages of Q1 and Q2 by lowering the collector voltage of Q1 by an amount equal to VBE4. This has three effects: first, it removes any mismatch between Q1 and Q2 due to the Early effect in Q1. This is the only first order source of mismatch in the three-transistor Wilson current mirror Second, at high currents the current gain, \\\\scriptstyle \\\\beta , of transistors decreases and the relation of collector current to base-emitter voltage deviates from \\\\scriptstyle i_C ~=~ I_S\\\\exp \\\\left( \\\\frac{v_{BE}}{V_T} \\\\right). The severity of these effects depends on the collector voltage. By forcing a match between the collector voltages of Q1 and Q2, the circuit makes the performance degradation at high current on the input and output branches symmetric. This extends the linear operating range of the circuit substantially. In one reported measurement on a circuit implemented with a transistor array for an application requiring 10 mA output, the addition of the fourth transistor extended the operating current for which the circuit showed less than 1 percent difference between input and output currents by at least a factor of two over the three transistor version.Wilson, B., Current mirrors, amplifiers and dumpers, Wireless World, December, 1981 pp. 47 - 51. At the time of the article, the author was affiliated with the Department of Instrumentation and Analytical Science, University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. Finally, equalizing the collector voltages also equalizes the power dissipated in Q1 and Q2 and that tends to reduce mismatch from the effects of temperature on VBE.  Advantages and Limitations  There are a number of other possible current mirror configurations in addition to the standard two-transistor mirror that a designer may choose to use. These include ones in which the mismatch from base current are reduced with an emitter follower, circuits that use cascoded structures or resistor degeneration to lower the static error and raise output impedance, and gain- boosted current mirrors that use an internal error amplifier to improve the effectiveness of cascoding. The Wilson current mirror has the particular advantages over alternatives that: * The static error, the input-output current difference, is reduced to very small levels attributable almost entirely to random device mismatches while the output impedance is raised by a factor of \\\\scriptstyle \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{2} simultaneously. * The circuit uses minimum resources. It does not require additional bias voltages or large area resistors as do cascoded or resistively degenerated mirrors. * The low impedance of its input and internal nodes makes it possible to bias the circuit for operation at frequencies up to \\\\scriptstyle \\\\frac{f_T}{10}. * The four-transistor version of the circuit has extended linearity for operation at high currents. The Wilson current mirror has the limitations that: * The minimum potentials from input or output to the common rail connection that are needed for proper operation are higher than for the standard two-transistor mirror. This reduces the headroom available to generate the input current and limits the compliance of the output. * This mirror uses feedback to raise the output impedance in such a way that the output transistor contributes collector current fluctuation noise to the output. All three transistors of the Wilson current mirror add noise to the output. * When the circuit is biased for high frequency operation with maximum \\\\scriptstyle f_T, the negative feedback loop that maximizes the output impedance may cause peaking in the frequency response of the mirror. For stable, low-noise operation it may be necessary to modify the circuit to eliminate this effect. * In some applications of a current mirror, particularly for biasing and active load applications, it is advantageous to produce multiple current sources from a single input reference current. This is not possible in the Wilson configuration while maintaining an accurate match of the input current to the output currents.  MOSFET Implementation  Figure 5: NMOS Wilson current mirror. M3 equalizes the drain-source voltages of M1 and M2 When the Wilson current mirror is used in CMOS circuits, it is usually in the four transistor form as in Fig. 5. If the transistor pairs M1-M2 and M3-M4 are exactly matched and the input and output potentials are approximately equal, then in principle there is no static error, the input and output currents are equal because there is no low frequency or DC current into the gate of a MOSFET. However, there are always mismatches between transistors caused by random lithographic variation in device geometry and by variations in threshold voltage between devices. For long-channel MOSFETs operating in saturation at fixed drain- source voltage, \\\\scriptstyle V_{DS}, the drain current is proportional to device sizes and to the magnitude of the difference between the gate-source voltage and the device threshold voltage as :i_D \\\\propto \\\\frac{W}{L} \\\\left( v_{GS} - V_{TH} \\\\right)^2 ... (8) where \\\\scriptstyle W is the device width, \\\\scriptstyle L is its length and \\\\scriptstyle V_{TH} the device threshold voltage. Random lithographic variations are reflected as different values of the \\\\scriptstyle \\\\frac{W}{L} ratio of each transistor. Similarly threshold variations appear as small differences in the value of \\\\scriptstyle V_{TH} for each transistor. Let \\\\scriptstyle \\\\Delta \\\\frac{W}{L} ~\\\\equiv~ \\\\frac{W_2}{L_2} \\\\,-\\\\, \\\\frac{W_1}{L_1} and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\Delta V_{TH} ~=~ V_{TH2} \\\\,-\\\\, V_{TH1}. The mirror circuit of Fig. 5 forces the drain current of M1 to equal the input current and the output configuration assures that the output current equals the drain current of M2. Expanding equation (8) in a two-variable Taylor series about \\\\scriptstyle i_{D1} and truncating after the first linear term, leads to an expression for the mismatch of the drain currents of M1 and M2 as: :i_\\\\text{in} \\\\,-\\\\, i_\\\\text{out} ~=~ \\\\left( \\\\frac{2\\\\,\\\\Delta V_{TH}}{V_{GS1} \\\\,-\\\\, V_{TH1}} \\\\,-\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\frac{W}{L}}{\\\\frac{W_1}{L_1}} \\\\right)i_\\\\text{in} ... (9) The statistics of the variation in threshold voltage of matched pairs across a wafer have been studied extensively.Pelgrom M. J. M., Duinmaijer, A. C. J., and Welbers, A. P. G.,\\"Matching Properties of MOS Transistors,\\" IEEE J. Solid-State Circuits, 24 (Oct. 1989) pp. 1433-1440 The standard deviation of the threshold voltage variation depends on the absolute size of the devices, the minimum feature size of the manufacturing process, and the body voltage and is typically 1 to 3 millivolts. Therefore, to keep the contribution of the threshold voltage term in equation (9) to a percent or less requires biasing the transistors with the gate-source voltage exceeding the threshold by several tenths of a volt. This has the subsidiary effect of lowering the contribution of the mirror transistors to the output current noise because the drain current noise density in a MOSFET is proportional to the transconductance and therefore inversely proportional to \\\\scriptstyle V_{GS} \\\\,-\\\\, V_{TH}.Johns, David A., and Martin, Ken,\\"Analog Integrated Circuit Design,\\" John Wiley, 1997, pp. 199-201. Similarly, careful layout is required to minimize the effect of the second, geometric term in (9) that is proportional to \\\\scriptstyle \\\\Delta \\\\frac{W}{L}. One possibility is to subdivide transistors M1 and M2 into multiple devices in parallel that are arranged in a common-centric or interdigitated layout with or without dummy guard structures on the perimeter.Baker, R. Jacob, Li, Harry W., and Boyce, David E., \\"CMOS Circuit Design, Layout, and Simulation,\\" IEEE Press, 1998, pp. 444-449. The output impedance of the MOSFET Wilson current mirror can be calculated in the same way as for the bipolar version. If there is no body effect in M4, the low frequency output impedance is given by \\\\scriptstyle z_O ~\\\\approx~ \\\\left( 1 \\\\,+\\\\, g_{m4}r_{O1} \\\\right)r_{O4}. For M4 not to have a body-source potential, it must be implemented in a separate body well. However, the more common practice is for all four transistors to share a common body connection. The drain of M2 is a relatively low impedance node and this limits the body effect. The output impedance in that case is: :z_O \\\\approx \\\\left( 2 + g_{m4}r_{O1} \\\\right)r_{O4} ... (10) As in the case of the bipolar transistor version of this circuit, the output impedance is much larger than it would be for the standard two-transistor current mirror. Since \\\\scriptstyle r_{O4} would be the same as the output impedance of the standard mirror, the ratio of the two is \\\\scriptstyle 2 \\\\,+\\\\, g_{m4}r_{O1}, which is often quite large. The principal limitation on the use of the Wilson current mirror in MOS circuits is the high minimum voltages between the ground connection in Fig. 5 and the input and output nodes that are required for proper operation of all transistors in saturation. The voltage difference between the input node and ground is \\\\scriptstyle v_{GS1} + v_{GS4}. The threshold voltage of MOS devices is usually between 0.4 and 1.0 volts with no body effect depending on the manufacturing technology. Because \\\\scriptstyle v_{GS} must exceed the threshold voltage by a few tenths of a volt to have satisfactory input-output current match, the total input to ground potential is comparable to 2.0 volts. This difference is increased when the transistors share a common body terminal and the body effect in M4 raises its threshold voltage. On the output side of the mirror, the minimum voltage to ground is \\\\scriptstyle v_{GS2} + v_{GS4} - V_{TH4}. This voltage is likely to be significantly greater than 1.0 volts. Both potential differences leave insufficient headroom for the circuitry that provides the input current and uses the output current unless the power supply voltage is higher than 3 volts. Many contemporary integrated circuits are designed to use low voltage power supplies to accommodate the limitations of short-channel transistors, to meet the need for battery operated devices and to have high power efficiency in general. The result is that new designs tend to use some variant of a wide swing cascode current mirror configuration.Johns, David A., and Martin, Ken,\\"Analog Integrated Circuit Design,\\" John Wiley, 1997, pp. 256-265.Babanezhad, Joseph N., and Gregorian, Roubik, \\"Programmable Gain/Loss Circuit,\\" IEEE J. Solid-State Circuits, SC-22 (Dec. 1987) pp. 1082-1090. In the case of extremely low power supply voltages of one volt or less, the use of current mirrors may be abandoned entirely.

In 1924, Avey moved his family to Tulsa, intending to start a new venture for Sandow. Avey was well aware that the athletic program at Oklahoma A.& M. (now Oklahoma State University) had become notable for training prospective young professional wrestlers, but there was no venue in Oklahoma to stage public matches, which were becoming wildly popular elsewhere in the country. He met up with Whiteside and concluded that Tulsa was ripe and ready for such a venue. Pro wrestling shows bore little resemblance to Olympic wrestling, the (Greco-Roman) type that A&M; students learned. The emphasis was definitely put on showmanship. Its practitioners had outlandish personalities and questionable ethics. Avey first recruited a former A&M; star named Leroy McGuirk, who had become the U.S. Junior Heavyweight wrestling champ. Out of town pros jumped at a chance to take down the local favorite, who was a credible opponent. Unfortunately, McGuirk was blinded in an auto accident en route to a match in Little Rock. Avey took him out of the ring, put him to work setting up matches, and gave him a stake in Avey's company. Other notable performers who graced the Coliseum ring included \\"Killer\\" Kowalski, \\"Strangler\\" Lewis, \\"Farmer\\" Jones and Al \\"Spider\\" Galento. \\"Spider was especially popular because he would offer money to any man in the audience who could stay in the ring with him for more than a minute. The cash reward was one dollar a minute and $100 to any volunteer who won. The Oilers played in the American Hockey Association (AHA) from 1929 (1928‚Äì29 season) - 1942, and the United States Hockey League (USHL) from 1945 to 1951. The Oilers first disbanded in 1942, and were revived under the ownership of Avey in 1945. The Oilers disbanded when the USHL disbanded in 1951. Destruction Avey also owned the radio station KAKC, and it broadcast from the Coliseum basement. On September 20, 1952, the building caught fire when it was struck by lightning. A later report said that the KAKC antenna, which was located atop the building had attracted the bolt. The building‚Äôs dry wooden roof accelerated the fire. There were no events scheduled that night, so only two people were in the building, both KAKC employees. One happened to be outside on break, when the bolt hit. He went back to the basement office, where his co-worker was monitoring a network feed, unaware of what had just happened to their own building. After switching to look at images from the roof top camera, they exited quickly and safely. The first fire alarm was received at 9:31 PM. Two more alarms were turned in later. Within minutes, Tulsa Fire Department responded to the scene with ten fire trucks and 150 fire fighters. A significant number of responders had come from nearby cities, but all efforts subsequently proved futile. Before midnight, the entire roof collapsed into the building, pulling down much of the exterior walls as it fell. It seemed obvious then that the facility was a total loss. Avey and his wife had gone out that night to a house-warming party for his daughter and son-in-law, so it took a while before one of his employees located him and gave him the bad news over the telephone. He drove to the site and arrived just after the west section of the roof collapsed. He then went home to watch reports on TV, after telling a reporter, \\"... I've had too many happy memories in that old barn to watch it die.\\" Police estimated that the raging fire attracted approximately 12,000 spectators as it occurred, and that another 125,000 drove by the next day to view the wreckage. When another reporter asked Avey about the damage estimate, the owner offhandedly said that it would be about one million dollars. Later, a professional estimate showed that replacement of the facility would cost around $2.5 million. Avey could not raise the additional funding, and had to file for bankruptcy. The debris was removed and the property was cleared for conversion into parking lots. The Coliseum was never repaired or replaced.

Biography Willie and Tad with their mother's nephew, Lockwood Todd, in Mathew Brady's studio, January 1, 1861 Willie and his younger brother Tad were considered \\"notorious hellions\\" when they lived in Springfield. Their father's law partner William Herndon said they pulled books off their shelves while their father appeared oblivious.Wead (2003), p. 90. When Abraham Lincoln took office as President of the United States, Willie and Tad moved into the White House. To give them playmates, Mary Todd Lincoln asked Julia Taft to bring her younger brothers, 14-year-old \\"Bud\\" (Horatio Nelson Taft Jr., 1847‚Äì1915) and 12-year-old \\"Holly\\" (Halsey Cook Taft, 1849‚Äì1897) to the White House.Wead (2003), p. 91.Bayne (2001), pp. 1‚Äì3.

He died on February 20. Both parents and Tad were deeply affected. Lincoln said, \\"My poor boy. He was too good for this earth. God has called him home. I know that he is much better off in heaven, but then we loved him so much. It is hard, hard to have him die!\\";Mr. Lincoln's White House: Prince of Wales Room. Retrieved on 2012-12-16. after the burial, he shut himself in a room and wept alone. Mary Lincoln remained in bed for three weeks and was unable to attend Willie's funeral or look after Tad. Abraham Lincoln took solace in caring for and comforting Tad, who remained very ill and was grieving himself for his brother's death. Tad also lost the companionship of Bud and Holly, whom Mary refused to allow in the White House anymore, as they reminded her too much of Willie. Willie was interred at Oak Hill Cemetery in Georgetown. After Abraham Lincoln's assassination in 1865, he was re-interred at Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, Illinois, first in a temporary tomb and in 1871 in a state tomb alongside his father and his brother Eddie. Tad and Mary Todd Lincoln were also later placed in the crypt of the Lincoln Tomb.

It was originally owned by the Baltimore Company and Charles Carroll of Carrollton. In 1890 it was acquired by Blanchard and Susan Randall. When the nearby Loudon Park National Cemetery was deemed full, the War Department surveyed the area for a new site. In 1936 the federal government took possession of the land for a cost of $95,000, and began converting the estate to \\"Little Arlington\\".

He also did small figures in wax and clay. Biography He was born to a cultured merchant family and learned to draw at an early age.Biographical notes @ Kunstindeks Danmark. At first, however, he was primarily interested in animals, so he went to study agriculture at his uncle's estate near Slangerup. In the 1860s, one of his brothers introduced him to the painter, Hans Smidth, which made him decide to become an artist. He began his studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts with Carl B√∏gh and later came under the influence of Frederik Vermehren. He was also familiar with the animal portraits of Johan Thomas Lundbye and the 17th-century painter Paulus Potter.Brief biography @ Den Store Danske. In 1873, he was awarded the for his painting of horses swimming. In the 1880s, he began painting en plein aire and began to show some elements of Impressionism. At the age of thirty-five, concerned that his images were not realistic enough, he went to Paris to study with L√©on Bonnat. There, he practiced intensive croquis drawing; to capture the basics of position and movement. He also obtained knowledge of the radical trends in French art through his friend, R√©my Cogghe, with whom he spent some time in Spain and Italy. This all came together in a distinctive style. His favorite places for painting were Saltholm and Amager. In the winter of 1884-1885, Paul Gauguin made a visit to Copenhagen. Philipsen approached him for some advice and was shown how to use small brushes with quick, firm strokes. They remained friends for life. In 1890, he received the Eckersberg Medal. Around 1905, he began to suffer from an eye disease that interfered with his ability to paint. In 1915, he was awarded the Thorvaldsen Medal. He is generally credited with establishing Impressionism as an important aspect of Danish painting. Selected paintings File:Theodor Philipsen - Long Shadows.

The programme was to develop many aspects of the public transport services run by the LPTB and the suburban rail services of the Great Western Railway (GWR) and London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The investment was largely backed by government assistance as well as by the issuing of financial bonds and was estimated to cost ¬£42,286,000 in 1936LPTB submission to Parliament, (approximately ¬£ today). London Underground The Programme saw major reconstructions of many central area Underground stations, with escalators being installed to replace lifts; extensions of several tube lines; and connection to and electrification of a number of suburban lines.

Results and interruption=Before and during World War II Substantial and rapid progress was made on the network across the capital before the advent of World War II delayed, then prevented its completion. The Central line tunnel relining works were completed in 1938 and the replacement of the line's power supply was completed in 1940. The Bakerloo line service to Stanmore started on 20 November 1939. The 1938 tube stock came into operation as intended although the extensions they were built for were not completed at once. Progress on the Northern line works enabled the extension from to come into service as far as on 3 July 1939 (excluding Highgate station), where interchanges were made with the LNER services. Underground services to High Barnet commenced on 14 April 1940. Highgate station came into use on 19 January 1941 and services started operating on the branch to Mill Hill East on 18 May 1941. This latter section was finished, exceptionally, to serve Inglis Barracks. The outstanding electrification works on the remainder of the LNER's branch from Finsbury Park to Highgate, from Highgate to Alexandra Palace and from Mill Hill East to Edgware were halted. Works on the extension beyond Edgware were also stopped, although the construction of the new tube depot at Aldenham was completed and the buildings were used to construct Halifax bomber aircraft for the RAF. Other parts of the land purchased for the Bushey Heath extension were farmed during the war to provide food for London Transport canteens. On the Central line, works on the eastern extension had progressed furthest with tunnels constructed to and from to . These were put into service as air-raid shelters (with disastrous results at Bethnal Green) and as underground factories operated by Plessey. Postwar changes After the war, a prioritisation of the limited resources available to London Transport saw the Central line extensions progressed, with the first new section in the east opening to Stratford in 1946 and the services to and starting in 1948 and 1949. Initially, plans were put in place to complete the Northern Heights project during 1947 and 1948 and the plans for the extension to Bushey Heath were revised and parliamentary powers were renewed in 1947 for most of the outstanding New Works Programme.The renewed powers were granted under the Special Enactments (Extension of Time) Act, 1940 and granted additional time until December 1950 to complete the works. Also granted extensions of time were some earlier plans that had not been carried out, such as the extension of the Bakerloo line to Camberwell Green and originally approved in 1931. The cases for the Northern line extension to and the continuation of the Central line extension beyond West Ruislip to Denham were damaged by the introduction of the Town and Country Planning Act 1947, which led to the creation of Metropolitan Green Belt around the capital including areas of land through which the new lines were planned and which had been intended for development as housing. Plans for the Bushey Heath Extension were reduced to an extension to in 1949. In 1953 the decision was made to cancel this part as well. The GN&C; branch had transferred to the Northern line before the war and remained under its control after the war, but it was never integrated into the rest of the line. The completion of the electrification of the LNER's remaining tracks from Finsbury Park to Alexandra Palace and from Mill Hill East to Edgware was abandoned, and equipment already installed was removed for reuse elsewhere. The bridge just east of Mill Hill East was rebuilt with provision for a second track, which was never laid. The Finsbury Park-to-Alexandra Palace section remained with the LNER, and then British Railways, until it was closed in 1954. The Mill Hill-to-Edgware section, which had been closed to passenger traffic, remained in use as a single-track goods line until 1964. The electrification of the Metropolitan line from Rickmansworth to Amersham and Chesham was not completed until 12 September 1960. and the quadrupling of the tracks was not completed until 1961, but only to a point north of Moor Park. The complete resignalling of the line north of was done by 1959. As electrification did not take place all the way north to Aylesbury, the Metropolitan line service north of Amersham was withdrawn in 1961. The Plan to convert Locomotive-hauled steam stock to Electric working was abandoned, and new EMUs, designed in the 1950s, replaced existing steam and electric locomotives from 1960. They were called the A60 stock. The scheme to replace trams with trolleybuses was halted shortly after the outbreak of war, with the final conversion taking place on 9 June 1940. The remaining tram routes, mainly in south London, were not finally replaced until 6 July 1952, and then by diesel buses, rather than trolleybuses. The Aldenham site was converted for use as a bus overhaul works for all London Transport buses and opened in 1955.

It was the site of a former ferry crossing that spanned from the Humber Estuary to Hull, serving as a place for ships and boats crossing the Humber to moor away from the tidal flow. A port continues to exist nearby and the area's rail access is based at the Barrow Haven railway station, a stop on the Barton Line. History=Medieval and early modern On 5 October 1541 Henry VIII conducted a visit to Hull with the Privy Council, subsequently reaching Barrow Haven by water. The then King of England later travelled by horseback to Thornton Abbey. Between the Barrow Beck (a local stream) and West Hann Lane, lie the remains of a large motte-and-bailey castle, known as Barrow Castle. Built in the Norman style, the two large structures stand with a low motte (a section of raised earthwork) situated between them. Extensive excavations were carried out in 1963 to determine the extent of the remains. Ferry and railway With the building of the railway line in 1848, the ferry service gradually disappeared as passengers preferred to embark from New Holland, but a market boat operated into the 1940s. The market boat depot was in a ramped building that is now the site where the imported timber is stored. From its inception in 1848, the railway station consisted of a single open platform on the south side of the railway line to the east of Ferry Road. In the early twentieth century, a wooden ticket office and waiting room, with pot-belly stove, was constructed on the northern side of the railway line. This remained in place until the 1970s but with modernisation, the ticket office was removed to a Railway Museum, in Kirton Lindsey, on the Windmill site. Later it was taken to Burgh le Marsh, near Skegness. An open platform is again in use. Brickworks Barrow Haven was once renowned for its bricks and pantiles made from clay recovered from the edges of the Humber. Sanderson's and Pearson's brickyards were located on the west bank of the Haven and Foster's and Greenwood's on the east bank. The land formerly occupied by Sanderson's brickyard is now a caravan site and little evidence of the brickyard remains. These brickyards employed primitive, labour-intensive methods of manufacture. Clay was dug by hand during the summer months and stockpiled for use during the rest of the year. At Pearson's brickyard, the clay was hauled up a slope in metal skips and tipped into the clay mill. The clay mill rolled and squeezed the excess moisture from the clay and then extruded it into a rectangular shape approximately twenty four inches wide by twelve inches deep. This extrusion was cut into manageable segments with a wire and the segments stored in a cool building to wait collection by the labourers who operated the tile and brick-forming machines. These machines were hand-operated and required considerable strength to crank. The labourers were generally employed on 'piecework' and low-paid. The extruded bricks and pantiles were stored on the shelves of drying-sheds, each approximately fifty yards long. Wooden shutters on the side of the sheds could be adjusted to control the drying rate prior to the bricks and pantiles being taken to the kiln for firing. If the unbaked clay was allowed to dry too rapidly, the bricks and pantiles would develop cracks before firing. The Haven was an important landing point for barges bringing coal to fuel these brickyard kilns from the Yorkshire coalfields. Once firing began, the kiln was tended night and day as the coal had to be shovelled by hand to keep up the heat. The resulting products were generally high quality and extremely durable. Haven Inn An eighteenth- century coaching inn, Haven Inn is situated on Ferry Road near the intersection with Marsh Lane. Haven Inn was run by landlady Mrs. Naomi Mason from 1902 to 1943; a Mr. Fred Mason farmed the attached land and some other land in Barrow Haven; Mrs Mason, a farmer's wife as well as landlady, and undertook such duties as milking cows, and making butter and cream cheese for sale at Brigg Market. Poultry was also kept, and eggs were sent to market. A local bus, owned by Wesley Clark of Barrow upon Humber, took the farmers to Brigg on Market Day (Thursday). At Christmas time, poultry were dressed and sold at the market. Local buildings The hamlet has the remains of a windmill. There was a small Wesleyan chapel, now converted into a house; the datestone has been left in the brickwork. There were once cottages for workmen along the banks of the Humber west of the railway bridge. Access was via a footpath that went through a gate at the north-western end of the railway bridge over the Haven or via West Marsh Lane and two wooden gates on either side of the railway line. These cottages were not provided with electricity, water or sanitation facilities. Kerosene lamps, hand pumps and earth toilets were standard. Floors were generally constructed of brick laid directly on the ground and the walls had no damp-proof courses. Cast iron fireplaces, consisting of a coal-fired open grate with a boiler box on one side and an oven on the other, were the sole means of heating and cooking. Disposal of household rubbish and night soil consisted of dumping into the Humber at any convenient tide. A shop stocked with produce through the market boat catered for the immediate needs of the local population, but more substantial purchases required travelling to Barton on Humber, or to New Holland and from there by ferry to Hull. An additional shop, run by a Mrs Dee, was on the Barrow Road; it was a lean-to attached to a house. A coal yard was next to the shop, on the Clew Bridge side of the building, which was first owned by Mr. Dee's, but in the 1930s it was owned by a Clifford Hastings. His coal was delivered by barge along the Haven. In later years he had a further coal yard just south of the station. Water The workers' cottages alongside the river suffered flooding whenever spring tides raised the level of the Humber. These buildings were largely abandoned by the 1960s and were demolished as tidal fortifications and river bank conservation took place along the south bank of the river. During this same period, the banks of the haven were raised on both sides, from the mouth of the Haven to as far as the old sluice gates. This minimised the Haven bursting its banks during spring tides and flooding the houses in the hamlet proper. The sluice gates, locally known as Clew Gates, marked the point where the spring-fed stream from Barrow upon Humber known as the Beck, became the Haven. Approximately 50 metres south of the railway line, a small watercourse, also known locally as 'the clew', drained land from east of Ferry Road into the Haven, passing under Ferry Road through a large pipe. Despite the presence of many salt water-flooded claypits, fresh water springs are common in the area. When the tide is suitable, dabs, flounders and eels can be caught in the haven and the flooded claypits contain roach, perch, tench, bream and eels. A boatyard and dry dock were situated on the east bank of the Haven, immediately north of the railway line. A re- furbished nissen hut and slipway are all that remains of what was once a boat building and repair industry for the Humber's two types of sailing barge, the sloop and the keel. Motor-powered barges, including a Dutch barge and a Humber sloop, still moor in the haven and rest on the mud on their flat bottoms when the tide recedes. Watercress Until the 1970s there was a commercial watercress industry, run by the now-defunct Greatford Gardens Watercress Company, using water pumped from artesian bores reaching deep within the limestone strata of the Lincolnshire Wolds. In some years, the bores became naturally flowing artesian wells when pressure was sufficient to allow the water to reach the surface without the aid of pumps. Spring water with a slight alkalinity, such as that imparted by the limestone strata, is especially suitable for watercress. Some remnants of this industry can be found to the west of the old sluice gates, approximately eight hundred yards south of the Haven Inn. Other watercress beds owned by the company were located to the east of Ferry Road but have now been ploughed over and little evidence remains of their existence. At the eastern location, there were approximately twenty five watercress beds each ten yards wide by one hundred yards long. The beds were built with a slight gradient and water was directed through a channel into the highest end and then allowed flow gently down the length of the bed before leaving through a narrow opening at the lower end. The water then flowed into a channel which directed it into the Beck approximately fifty yards to the east of the Clew Gates. The watercress was gathered by hand and put onto wooden trays before being taken to a packing shed where it was divided into bundles, labelled and then the roots cut off. The bunches were then packed into wooden baskets, known as chips and transported by road to the rail and ferry centre at New Holland for delivery to customers. The severed roots were returned to the watercress bed where they were replanted. The company had similar watercress farms at Healing, Lincolnshire, Stamford, Lincolnshire and Fordingbridge, Hampshire. The company ceased its operations in Barrow Haven when it lost its water rights. Second World War Barrow Haven was also the site for an anti-aircraft battery, Anti Aircraft battery which provided protection for the city of Hull. Remains of an observation post are located on the edge of the Humber close to what was once Greenwood's brickyard.

The term is used in the natural sciences to describe varying density of matter, but can apply to any quantity whose density can be measured. Aerodynamics In the study of supersonic flight, Schlieren photography observes the density gradient of air as it interacts with aircraft. Also in the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics, Density gradient is used to observe the acoustic waves, shock waves or expansion waves in the flow field. Water A steep density gradient in a body of water can have the effect of trapping energy and preventing convection, such a gradient is employed in solar ponds. In the case of salt water, sharp gradients can lead to stratification of different concentrations of salinity. This is called a Halocline. Biology In the life sciences, a special technique called density gradient separation is used for isolating and purifying cells, viruses and subcellular particles. Variations of this include Isopycnic centrifugation, Differential centrifugation, and Sucrose gradient centrifugation. A blood donation technique called Pheresis involves density gradient separation. Geophysics The understanding of what is at the centre of the earth, the earth core, requires the framework of density gradients in which elements and compounds then interact. The existence of a fast breeder nuclear reactor system at the core of the earth is one theory by reason of density gradient. A popular model for the density gradient of Earth is one given by the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM) that is based on the observed oscillations of the planet and the travel times of thousands of seismic waves. Several models for density gradient have been built on the basis of PREM but they acknowledge that the \\"distribution of density as a function of position within the Earth is much less well constrained than the seismic velocities. The primary information comes from the mass and moment of inertia of the Earth and this information alone requires that there be a concentration of mass towards the centre of the globe. Additional information is to be found in the frequencies of the graver normal modes of the Earth which are sensitive to density through self-gravitation effects induced in deformation\\".

It was part of the Royal Tank Regiment, itself part of the Royal Armoured Corps. It was originally formed by converting the 7th Battalion, King's Regiment (Liverpool), a Territorial Army infantry battalion that recruited mainly in the Bootle area, to a tank unit. Equipped with Vickers Valentine tanks, the regiment served with the 23rd Armoured Brigade in North Africa. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel J.L. Finigan it fought at El Alamein and acquired the nickname \\"Monty's Foxhounds\\" during the long pursuit of the Afrika Korps and the Italian Army across Egypt and Libya and into Tunisia. It later served in the Italian Campaign and then in Greece during the Greek Civil War. The Regiment was placed in suspended animation in mid-1946, and then reconstituted at Liverpool as an armoured regiment of the Territorial Army in 1947. In recognition of its services in North Africa, Vickers Engineering presented Colonel Finigan with a silver model of the Valentine which still serves as a centrepiece when former officers of the Regiment and its successor dine formally together.

Life and career Pinto was born in Lambeth and baptised as George Sanders. His father, Samuel Sanders (or Saunders) died young; his mother, Julia Sanders (n√©e Pinto) was the daughter of Thomas Pinto (1714-c.1780), a London violinist of Italian origin. Thomas Pinto's second wife, the English singer Charlotte Brent (1735‚Äì1802), encouraged George's early musical upbringing. Temperley (2001) He used his mother's maiden name as his surname throughout his professional career.Brown (2006) Pinto started taking music lessons aged 8 with the musician and impresario Johann Salomon. Initially he was promoted as a prodigy on the violin. In 1795 Pinto, then aged 9, made his debut playing a violin concerto by Giovanni Mane Giornovichi at the New Lyceum in Hanover Square London. In 1796 Salomon arranged for Pinto to play a violin concerto at Signora Salvini's benefit concert. Following this, he made frequent appearances in London and other British centres, and possibly twice travelled to Paris. In 1800 he played at a concert of Salomon accompanied by John Field (to whom he later dedicated his piano sonata in C minor of 1803 - \\"Inscribed to his Friend John Field\\"). His Op. 1, three divertimenti for piano were advertised in 1801 (no copies have survived); his Op. 2, also for piano, comprising three sets of variations, was published in 1802. It is not known who taught Pinto the piano, but from this period on it would seem to have become his preferred instrument. In January 1803 at Phillip Corri's Edinburgh concerts, Pinto took the place of an injured Corri where he \\"presided at the keyboard\\". The writer and musician Alexander Campbell wrote: > Young Pinto is not only an admirable violin player, but also a first-rate > performer on the grand piano forte: to excel on two instruments so widely > difrent from each other, is a proof of genius and unwearied application very > seldom to be met with. If dissipation, and consequent idleness, do not > impede him in his career, what may not the musical world expect in his riper > manhood? In 1804 Pinto began to suffer serious ill-health. This did not prevent him composing and between then and his death in 1806 appeared all his major works, including piano sonatas and violin sonatas, as well as two sets of violin duets. He also composed a number of songs and shorter piano pieces. A violin concerto written by him is now lost, although the manuscript was described in an article in the Musical World of 1850 (vol. XXV, p.2). After breaking off a planned series of concerts in Oxford in 1805, he died in London in 1806 at the age of 20, apparently of tuberculosis. Some of his posthumous works were completed by Samuel Wesley and Joseph Woelfl. Legacy It has been suggested that the numerous references to Pinto's \\"dissipation\\" by contemporaries may be covert hints about homosexuality. Tributes after his death included Salomon's comment: \\"If he had lived and been able to resist the allurements of society, England would have had the honour of producing a second Mozart.\\" Samuel Wesley commented \\"A greater musical Genius has not been known\\". Other tributes came from William Ayrton and Johann Baptist Cramer. Pinto's music was more or less forgotten after his death, although interest was shown by William Sterndale Bennett. It was not until the 1960s that interest in his works was rekindled. The musicologist Nicholas Temperley has noted that the piano works contain \\"astonishing anticipations of Beethoven, Schubert and even Chopin\\", and has opined that \\"only Schubert himself wrote more striking songs before the age of 20.\\" The composer Geoffrey Bush has said of Pinto's G minor violin sonata that it is \\"passionate in mood, cogent in argument, and full of splendid thematic invention.\\" Pinto's piano sonatas have been recorded on CD by Thomas Wakefield, Ian Hobson, Riko Fukuda, M√≠c√©al O'Rourke and others, while some of his vocal works have been recorded on the Hyperion label. Nicholas Temperley's The London Pianoforte School 1766‚Äì1860. (20 vols.

Brig. Gen. James H. Wilson led his Union Army Cavalry Corps to destroy Southern manufacturing facilities and was opposed unsuccessfully by a much smaller force under Confederate Lt. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest. Background and opposing forces After his victory at the Battle of Nashville, Union Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas and his Army of the Cumberland found themselves with virtually no organized military opposition in the heart of the South. Thomas ordered Brig. Gen. James H. Wilson (who commanded the Cavalry Corps of the Military Division of the Mississippi, but was attached to Thomas's army) to lead a raid to destroy the arsenal at Selma, Alabama, in conjunction with Maj. Gen. Edward Canby's operations against Mobile. Selma was strategically important as one of the few Confederate military bases remaining in Southern hands. The town contained an arsenal, a naval foundry, gun factories, a powder mill, military warehouses, and railroad repair shops. Wilson led approximately 13,500 men in three divisions, commanded by Brig. Gens. Edward M. McCook, Eli Long, and Emory Upton. Each cavalryman was armed with the formidable 7-shot Spencer repeating rifle. His principal opponent was Lt. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, whose Cavalry Corps of the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana consisted of about 2,500 troopers organized into two small divisions, led by Brig. Gens. James R. Chalmers and William H. Jackson, two partial brigades under Brig. Gen. Philip D. Roddey and Colonel Edward Crossland, and a few local militia. Raid Wilson was delayed in crossing the rain-swollen Tennessee River, but he got underway on March 22, 1865, departing from Gravelly Springs in Lauderdale County, Alabama. He sent his forces in three separate columns to mask his intentions and confuse the enemy; Forrest learned very late in the raid that Selma was the primary target. Minor skirmishes occurred at Houston (March 25) and Black Warrior River (March 26), and Wilson's columns rejoined at Jasper on March 27. the Quad at the University of Alabama in 1859. The Rotunda can be seen at center, with the halls visible in the background. All of these buildings were destroyed during Wilson's Raid on April 4, 1865. On March 28, at Elyton, in present-day Birmingham, another skirmish occurred and the Union troopers destroyed the Oxmoor and Irondale iron furnaces. A detachment of General Emory Upton's division destroyed the C.B. Churchill and Company foundry in Columbiana and the Shelby Iron Works in Shelby on March 31, 1865.http://www.bhamwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Shelby_Furnace Tuscaloosa Wilson also detached a 1,500 man brigade under Brig. Gen. John T. Croxton and sent them south and west to burn the Roupes Valley Ironworks at Tannehill and Bibb Naval Furnace at Brierfield on March 31. They then burned the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, which was a prominent military school, on April 4.Jones, p. 60 This movement diverted Chalmer's division away from Forrest's main force. Selma On March 31, Forrest was routed by the larger, better-armed Union force at Montevallo. The cavalrymen under Chalmers had not arrived to reinforce Forrest, but he could not wait. During the action, Forrest's headquarters were overrun and documents captured that gave valuable intelligence concerning his plans. Wilson dispatched McCook to link up with Croxton's brigade at Trion (now Vance) and then led the remainder of his force rapidly toward Selma. Forrest made a stand on April 1 at Plantersville, near Ebenezer Church, and was routed once again at the Battle of Ebenezer Church. The Confederates raced toward Selma and deployed into a three-mile, semicircular defensive line anchored at both ends by the Alabama River. The Battle of Selma took place on April 2. The divisions of Long and Upton assaulted Forrest's hastily constructed works. The dismounted Union troopers broke through by afternoon, after brief periods of hand-to-hand combat; the inexperienced militiamen abandoning their positions and fleeing was the primary reason for the entire line breaking. General Wilson personally led a mounted charge of the 4th U.S. Cavalry against an unfinished portion of the line. General Long was severely wounded in the head during the assault. Forrest, who was also wounded, and whose tiny corps was severely damaged, regrouped at Marion, where he finally rejoined Chalmers. Wilson's men worked for over a week at destroying military facilities. From there, Wilson's forces moved toward Montgomery, which they occupied on April 12. West Point Despite Robert E. Lee's April 9 surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia following the Battle of Appomattox Court House, the Army of Tennessee under the command of Gen Joseph E. Johnston had not yet surrendered the Confederate forces in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Wilson's plan was to head east into Georgia to destroy the remaining arsenals and munitions, and to cause any remaining local forces to \\"disintegrate.\\"Jones, pp. 117-8 Wilson's success in this plan would be accelerated if his forces could secure at least one of several key bridges over the Chattahoochee River. One such bridge led into the town of West Point. To avoid any delay in the raid, Wilson separated his force sending a 3,700-man detachment under Colonel Oscar Hugh La Grange to capture both the bridge and the town.\\"Out of the Storm: The End of the Civil War, April‚ÄìJune 1865\\" by Noah Andre Trudeau Simultaneously, Wilson ordered Upton's division to rush toward another strategically important bridge at Columbus, Georgia. The Battle of West Point, Georgia, was fought on Easter Sunday, April 16, when Colonel Oscar Hugh La Grange's brigade attacked an earthwork defensive position named Fort Tyler that was defended by a couple hundred young men and teenaged Confederates under CS Brig. Gen. Robert C. Tyler. Determined to fight to the last ditch, the Confederates fought a wave of dismounted Union troops. The Confederates did not stand a chance as they were largely outnumbered and poorly armed, whereas the Federals were armed with repeaters. The Union soldiers crossed over a ditch while the rebels hurled primitive hand-grenades and fired their weapons.Trudeau, pp. 253-54 Although the Union men had to assault under the fire of one 32-pounder gun and two 12-pounders inside the earthwork, the fort was captured. Confederate Brig. Gen. Robert C. Tyler was mortally wounded by a sharpshooter, becoming the last general officer to be killed in the Civil War. The defense of West Point was doomed to fail, and had done so. With rebel prisoners, the fort, and bridge in his hands, La Grange moved out to rejoin Wilson. The battle had been won for the Union at a cost of 36 casualties both killed and wounded. The Confederates had lost 18 men killed, 28 wounded, and the remainder captured. With most of the dead southerners in the fort, one Yankee artilleryman said the dead Confederates wore \\"an awful look.\\"Trudeau, pp. 254 Columbus In a separate battle on Easter Sunday, April 16, Wilson was victorious in the Battle of Columbus, Georgia, in which Upton's division clashed with Confederate forces at Columbus, capturing the city and its naval works and burning, then scuttling the incomplete ironclad ram, CSS Jackson. This engagement is widely regarded as the \\"Last Battle of the Civil War.\\"Civil War Times, April 2003\\"The Last Battle of The Civil War,\\" by Charles Swift. On April 20, Wilson's men captured Macon, Georgia, without resistance, and Wilson's Raid came to an end. This was only six days before General Joseph E. Johnston's surrender of all Confederate troops in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida to William Tecumseh Sherman, in North Carolina. Aftermath and capture of Jefferson Davis Wilson's Raid had been a spectacular success. His men captured five fortified cities, 288 cannons, and 6,820 prisoners, at a cost of 725 Union casualties. Forrest's casualties, from a much smaller force, numbered 1,200. The raid was done without the disastrous collateral damage that characterized Sherman's March to the Sea of the previous year. Residents accused Wilson's men of sacking Selma after the battle, but the damage there came from many sources including street combat that continued into the night, as well as 35,000 bales of cotton and the Central Commercial Warehouse fired by Confederates as the city fell. Some Union soldiers and newly liberated former slaves did engage in plunder. After the first night, Wilson re- established discipline.Jones, pp. 92-96 Upon conclusion of the raid, and following the surrender of all of the Confederate forces east of the Chattahoochee River by Johnston to Sherman, the hostilities in the theater ended. However, the pursuit of fleeing officials of the Confederate government commenced as Wilson's forces fanned out through the region. Confederate President Jefferson Davis was captured on May 10, 1865, near Irwinville, Georgia.Jones, pp. 170-176 NotesReferences * Eicher, David J.

It began as part of the Pennsylvania Railroad, although the railroad got out of the shipping business soon after founding the company. In 1902, it became part of the International Navigation Co., with the American Line generally handling traffic between the United States ports of Philadelphia and New York City and the British ports of Liverpool and Southampton. Sister company Red Star Line handled traffic between America and the European continent, primarily through Antwerp, Belgium. The company's most prominent president was Clement Griscom, who led the company from 1888 to 1902 and worked as a company executive for its entire existence. During its existence, the company was the largest American shipping company, rivalled only by the smaller, Baltimore-based Atlantic Transport Lines, although this distinction is a marginal one, as all American oceanic shipping concerns were dwarfed by British companies such as the White Star Line or Cunard Line and German ones such as HAPAG. American Line 1870s advertisement The company became much larger when it bought out the Inman Line in 1886. In 1902, Griscom decided to merge his company with several other lines to create the International Mercantile Marine Company.

An unimportant agglomerate of buildings until the 19th century, Sesto San Giovanni grew during the end of the 19th century and in the early 20th century, becoming the site of several industries, including companies such as Falck, Campari, Magneti Marelli and Breda. In that period the population increased rapidly, from 5,000 inhabitants in 1880 to 14,000 in 1911. After World War II, Sesto became populated by many migrants from other parts of Italy, leading to an increased population of 95,000 inhabitants in 1981. Sesto used to be referred to as the \\"Stalingrad of Italy\\", due to the strong historical presence of the Italian Communist Party and to its resistance to fascism in World War Two. Because of its diverse and growing industries, Sesto has drawn many migrants. Census statistics from 2016 state that 17% of the population is not Italian. In the 1990s, Sesto San Giovanni suffered an economic crisis, and most of the larger companies in the town closed their premises.

A thick section of rock along its cliffs is designated the Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (or GSSP) representing the boundary between the Precambrian era and the Cambrian period, million years ago. Fortune Head was selected in 1992 over similar rock sections in Siberia, Russia, and Meischucum, China. because of its accessibility and abundance of fossils. Fortune Head Ecological Reserve Fortune Head was established as a provisional reserve in 1990, and then given full ecological reserve status in 1992 following Fortune Head‚Äôs selection as the global stratotype. The reserve is in size. The Fortune Head lighthouse, which is operated by the Canadian Coast Guard, is also on the reserve and functions as a visitor center. Geology Delegates from the Ichnia 2012 conference inspect the Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary at Fortune Head Ecological Reserve, Newfoundland, Canada. The boundary is defined on the appearance of the complex, vertical trace fossil Treptichnus (formerly Phycodes) pedum. The Burin Peninsula is part of the Avalon Zone of the Appalachian Orogen, the geology of which chronicles the late Precambrian Alleghenian Orogeny. The stratigraphy is not uniform throughout the region, however. The southern end of the peninsula includes a series of mafic pillow lavas, volcanigenic sediments, shales and limestones, collectively known as the \\"Burin Group\\", as well as a 1500 m thick sill of gabbro about 760 million years old. The northern end of the peninsula is defined by the \\"Marystown Group\\", primarily carbon-lacking Silica-based sediments which span the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary. The sediments were probably deposited in shoreline environments along the former Iapetus Ocean. The global stratotype at Fortune Head is composed of the uppermost part of member 1 and all of member 2 of the Chapel Island Formation of the Marystown Group. The Chapel Island Formation consists primarily of sandstones, siltstones, and limestones. Some of these rocks exhibit mud cracks and stromatolites, suggesting that deposition occurred in tidal or, at deepest, continental shelf environments. Fossils The boundary between the Precambrian and Cambrian is demarcated by the presence of trace fossils of Treptichnus pedum, one of the earliest animals. Without any hard anatomical features, Treptichnus is known only by its distinctive burrow pattern, which can be seen at Fortune Head. Fortune Head records the beginning of a period of increasing biological diversity known as the \\"Cambrian explosion\\", and it exhibits a number of other Cambrian and Precambrian fossils, including early shell fossils, vendotaenid algae, soft-bodied megafossils, and microfossils. Below Treptichnus, the stratotype at Fortune Head includes traces of the arthropod Monomorphichnus, vertical dwelling burrows from Skolithes and Arenicolites, cnidarian resting burrows from Conichnus and Bergauria, and more intricate feeding burrows from Gyrolithes. More complex fossils appear later.

The River Tolka (; , \\"the flood\\"), also once spelled Tolga,A Day's Ramble on the North Side of the City. The Dublin Penny Journal, Vol. 2, No. 87 (1 March 1834), pp. 273-275 is one of Dublin's three main rivers, flowing from County Meath to Fingal within the old County Dublin, and through the north of Dublin city, IrelandDoyle (2012), p. 13 (the other main rivers are the Liffey and the Dodder). By flow of water, the Tolka is the second largest river in Dublin, following the Liffey, but runs more slowly than the Dodder. Course and system The Tolka rises east of Dunshaughlin,Note: the Skane River drains the west of the village County Meath, and by-passes Dunboyne, from where it receives the Castle Stream tributary. From Clonee, where it is joined by the Clonee Stream at the eastern end of the village, it flows into County Dublin. The river continues through Damastown and Mulhuddart, Blanchardstown, and Ashtown (southwest of Finglas), and the southern edges of Finglas itself, and then the north Dublin suburban districts of Glasnevin and DrumcondraDoyle (2012), p. 14 where it comes closest to the Royal Canal near Binn's Bridge. At the southern side of Tolka Park it forms the border between Ballybough and Fairview, before entering Dublin Bay between East Wall and Clontarf.Doyle (2012), p. 15 Tributaries The Tolka has many tributaries, the first major one being the Castle Stream at Dunboyne. There are at least fourteen infalls within Dublin City boundaries (the count is complicated by connections with the Wad River system). Dublin City Council area tributaries include the East and West Pinkeen Streams, and another waterway in semi-rural Dublin, then the Scribblestown Stream (visible from Abbotstown to past Dunsink), the Finglaswood (or Mount Olivat) Stream from around Cappagh, the Finglas River (joined by a stream from St. Margaret's Road), the Claremont Stream which joins the Tolka near Bon Secours Hospital, the Cemetery Drain (so-called as it runs near Glasnevin Cemetery) before joining the Tolka just past the Botanic Gardens, the Hamstead Stream (from the area now occupied by Hamstead Park and DCU), inflowing somewhat downstream of Mobhi Bridge, and a small stream from around St. Patrick's Teacher Training College, Drumcondra. The last few tributaries connect to the tidal part of the Tolka, or its estuary, but have been confused by the merging of natural watercourses and city drainage lines. There are at least four such watercourses, including the multi-branched water sometimes called the \\"Grace Park Stream\\", another sometimes \\"Middle Arch Stream\\" and the Marino Stream. Wad River connections The Wad River system, coming from north Ballymun, interconnects with the Tolka, most notably via a link with the Claremont Stream, and with the Wad River Diversion, which flows along Ballymun Road and Glasnevin Avenue (the Wad's main outfall to the sea is at Clontarf, not far east from the Tolka's mouth).Doyle (2012), p. 10 Parks and green spaces The path of the river through Dublin takes it through a number of parks. It passes initially through the Tolka Valley Linear Park near Blanchardstown, then between trees north of River Road, then along the southern edge of the Tolka Valley Park in the western City Council area, where it receives a tributary which provides the source of water for a pond featuring considerable birdlife, including swans, ducks and herons. A large landscaped pitch and putt facility operated by Dublin City Council is situated on the southern side of the park, just south of the meandering river. The river later flows past the tree-lined recreational areas adjacent to Glasnevin Woods and Violet Hill, and forms the northern boundary of Glasnevin (Prospect) Cemetery before meeting the National Botanic Gardens. The river forms the northern border of the Botanic Gardens except for the beautiful Rose Gardens situated on the northern side and accessed via a bridge. Thereafter it passes Glasnevin village and flows into Griffith Park where it forms a major feature of the park. Having passed by Drumcondra village, the river runs behind housing, and the green spaces at the Archbishop's Palace and Clonliffe College, before coming to Ballybough. Below Annesley Bridge at Fairview, around which was originally the river mouth, before reclamation, it runs beyond one last green space, Fairview Park, and turns to reach the sea between East Wall and western Clontarf. Flooding The river floods infrequently but with occasional severity. It is not \\"flashy\\" like the Dodder but builds up over a period. Notable floods occurred in October 1880, December 1954, November 1965, August 1986 (Hurricane Charley), November 2000, November 2002, January and April 2005, August 2008 and October 2011; those of 1954 and 2002 were the most severe. In November 2002, flooding caused extensive damage to residential areas along the Tolka banks. After this, much work was done to strengthen the river's flood defences, and following heavy flooding in 2005, major works to deepen and widen the river were carried out on a number of stretches most notably at Glasnevin Woods and at Drumcondra Bridge. Controversially, the small natural waterfall at Glasnevin Woods was replaced by an artificial stepped fall. Analysis of the hydrological conditions giving rise to the 2002 flood showed that the classic conditions for a severe flood in the Tolka occurred, these being winter conditions with heavy rain in the previous days and weeks leading to saturated conditions followed by sustained severe rain over around 48 hours. Fauna On 28 September 2011, it was reported in the press that salmon have returned to spawn in the River Tolka for the first time in over 100 years. It was reported in 2013 that an Irish Wildlife Trust survey found otters living along the Tolka.Dodder otters and Tolka Tarkas Irish Times, 2013-09-28. On 22 July 2014, it was reported that a pollution incident had led to a major fish kill on the river Pollution kills fish Irish Times, 2014-07-22. Others of note are regular sightings of kingfisher, bats and grey heron. The river holds a large stock of small wild brown trout, this is topped up a few times a year by the angling club for competitions.

Epitheres are one of the most successful groups of animals. The monophyly of Epitheria has been challenged by molecular phylogenetic studies.For example: Springer, Mark S., Michael J.

It is, along with the Georgia Army National Guard, an element of the Georgia National Guard. As state militia units, the units in the Georgia Air National Guard are not in the normal United States Air Force chain of command. They are under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Georgia through the office of the Georgia Adjutant General unless they are federalized by order of the President of the United States. The Georgia Air National Guard is headquartered in Atlanta, GA, and its commander is Brigadier General Thomas F Grabowski. Overview Under the \\"Total Force\\" concept, Georgia Air National Guard units are considered to be Air Reserve Components (ARC) of the United States Air Force (USAF). Georgia ANG units are trained and equipped by the Air Force and are operationally gained by a Major Command of the USAF if federalized. In addition, the Georgia Air National Guard forces are assigned to Air Expeditionary Forces and are subject to deployment tasking orders along with their active duty and Air Force Reserve counterparts in their assigned cycle deployment window. Along with their federal reserve obligations, as state militia units the elements of the Georgia ANG are subject to being activated by order of the Governor to provide protection of life and property, and preserve peace, order and public safety. State missions include disaster relief in times of earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and forest fires, search and rescue, protection of vital public services, and support to civil defense. Components The Georgia Air National Guard has 3,000 airmen and officers assigned to two flying wings and six geographically separated units (GSUs) throughout Georgia. Major units of the Georgia ANG are: * 116th Air Control Wing : Established 30 July 1940 (as: 128th Observation Squadron); operates: E-8C Joint STARS : Stationed at: Robins Air Force Base, Warner- Robins : Gained by: Air Combat Command : The 116th ACW is the only Air National Guard unit operating the E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS), an advanced ground surveillance and battle management system.116th Air Control Wing website * 165th Airlift Wing : Established 20 August 1946 (as: 158th Fighter Squadron); operates: C-130 Hercules : Stationed at: Savannah International Airport, Savannah : Gained by: Air Mobility Command : The mission of the 165th Airlift Wing is to provide tactical airlift of personnel, equipment and supplies worldwide.165th Airlift Wing website Support Unit Functions and Capabilities: * 117th Air Control Squadron, Hunter Army Air Field, Savannah : Control of the highly charged and congested airspace over a given combat zone is the responsibility of the Georgia Air National Guard's unique 117th Air Control Squadron (117th ACS). * 139th Intelligence Squadron, Fort Gordon, Augusta : The primary mission of the 139th Intelligence Squadron (IS) is to execute cryptologic intelligence operations to satisfy strategic, operational and tactical intelligence requirements of national decision makers, combatant commands, combat operations, plans and forces. * 165th Air Support Operations Squadron, Savannah IAP : Deploys with, advise, and assist joint force commanders in planning, requesting, coordinating and controlling close air support, reconnaissance, and tactical airlift missions * 224th Joint Communications Squadron, Brunswick : The 224th Joint Communications Support Squadron (224th JCSS) provides general tactical communications support to a myriad of missions. * 283rd Combat Communications Squadron, Dobbins ARB, Marietta : Is responsible for \\"first-in\\" rapid deployment and \\"build-up\\" of an integrated force with state-of-the-art communications equipment and multi- skilled personnel. * 530th Air Force Band (Band of the South), Dobbins ARB, Marietta : Supports global Air Force and Air National Guard missions by fostering patriotism and providing musical services for the military community as well as the general public. * Savannah Combat Readiness Training Center (CRTC), Savannah IAP, Savannah : Provide the most realistic training environment possible for today‚Äôs war fighter. History The Militia Act of 1903 established the present National Guard system, units raised by the states but paid for by the Federal Government, liable for immediate state service. If federalized by Presidential order, they fall under the regular military chain of command. On 1 June 1920, the Militia Bureau issued Circular No.1 on organization of National Guard air units.ANG Chronology 1908-2007, see also Brief History of the Minnesota Air National Guard and the 133rd Airlift Wing, 1. The Georgia Air National Guard origins date to 1 May 1948 with the establishment of the 128th Observation Squadron and is oldest unit of the Georgia Air National Guard. The squadron is a descendant organization of the World War I 840th Aero Squadron, established on 1 February 1918. The 840th was a non-flying Air Service support unit, formed in Texas. Deployed to England in May 1918, then serving in the rear area behind the Western Front in France as an aircraft repair squadron beginning in August. Remained in France after the November 1918 Armistice, returning to Langley Field, Virginia in March 1919 and was demobilized. The 128th Observation Squadron was one of the 29 original National Guard Observation Squadrons of the United States Army National Guard formed before World War II. The 128th Observation Squadron was ordered into active service on 15 September 1941 as part of the buildup of the Army Air Corps prior to the United States entry into World War II. A Republic P-47N-25-RE Thunderbolt of the 128th Fighter Squadron at Marietta AAB, 1946 On 24 May 1946, the United States Army Air Forces, in response to dramatic postwar military budget cuts imposed by President Harry S. Truman, allocated inactive unit designations to the National Guard Bureau for the formation of an Air Force National Guard. These unit designations were allotted and transferred to various State National Guard bureaus to provide them unit designations to re-establish them as Air National Guard units.Rosenfeld, Susan and Gross, Charles J (2007), Air National Guard at 60: A History. Air National Guard history program AFD-080527-040 The modern Georgia ANG received federal recognition on 20 August 1946 as the 128th Fighter Squadron at Marietta Army Airfield. The 128th was equipped with F-47N Thunderbolts, and its mission was the air defense of the state. Also on 20 August, the 158th Fighter Squadron was activated at Chatam Army Airfield, Pooler, also equipped with F-47H's. Also, on 20 August 1946, the 54th Fighter Wing at Marietta Army Airfield. The 54th Fighter Wing was a command and control organization for units in the Southeastern region of the United States. The 54th controlled Air National Guard units in Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida and Georgia. On 9 September 1946, the 116th Fighter Group, also at Marietta AAF was activated, becoming an intermediate Command and Control organization for the 54th FW. The 1166th assumed control of both the 128th and 158th Fighter Squadrons. 18 September 1947, however, is considered the Georgia Air National Guard's official birth concurrent with the establishment of the United States Air Force as a separate branch of the United States military under the National Security Act. At the end of October 1950, the Air National Guard converted to the wing-base Hobson Plan organization. As a result, the wing was withdrawn from the Georgia ANG and was inactivated on 31 October 1950. The 116th Fighter Wing was established by the National Guard Bureau, allocated to the state of Georgia, recognized and activated 1 November 1950; assuming the personnel, equipment and mission of the inactivated 54th Fighter Wing. The 116th Fighter Wing was federalized on 10 October 1950 due to the Korean War. Controlling ANG squadrons from Georgia, Florida and California, the 116th deployed to Japan in August 1950 and was engaged in combat operations from Taegu AB (K-2), South Korea from December 1950 until July 1952 when it returned to the United States. On 10 July 1958, the 158th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Travis Field (formerly Chatam AFB), Pooler, was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 165th Fighter- Interceptor Group was established by the National Guard Bureau. The 158th FIS becoming the group's flying squadron. In 1962, the 165th began operating C-97F Stratofreighters, and has remained an airlift squadron ever since. Today, the 165th Airlift Wing flies the C-130H Hercules. On 1 April 1996, the 116th Fighter Wing was moved from Marietta to Robins Air Force Base, near Warner- Robins in central Georgia. The 116th became a B-1B Lancer Bomb Wing. However, in order to save money, in 2002 the USAF agreed to reduce its fleet of B-1Bs from 92 to 60 aircraft. The 116th Bomb Wing, having older aircraft was ordered to send its aircraft to \\"active storage\\" which meant that they could be quickly returned to service should circumstances dictate. Its first B-1B was flown to AMARC storage at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona on 20 August. The 116th was re-designated as the 116th Air Control Wing. The 116th ACW was a blend of active-duty and national guard Airmen into a single unit. The 116th ACW was equipped with the new E-8C Joint STARS airborne battle management aircraft. Its mission is command and control, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. Its primary mission is to provide theater ground and air commanders with ground surveillance to support attack operations and targeting that contributes to the delay, disruption and destruction of enemy forces. The E-8C evolved from Army and Air Force programs to develop, detect, locate and attack enemy armor at ranges beyond the forward area of troops. Starting in 2001, elements of every Air National Guard unit in Georgia were activated in support of the Global War on Terror. Flight crews, aircraft maintenance personnel, communications technicians, air controllers, intelligence analysts and air security personnel deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, Qatar, Uzbekistan and other locations throughout the Southwest Asia.

It is located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh. In February of 2020 the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth announced the school will cease operations after the 2019-2020 school year. Campus Vincentian Academy comprises three buildings housed on a campus in McCandless Township, a north suburb of Pittsburgh. At the time of its closure it had an approximate 13:1 student-to-teacher ratio,http://www.vincentianacademy.org/ourpages/auto/2012/11/13/58335669/Vincentian%20Academy%20School%20%20Profile%202014-2015.pdf and the enrollment as of the 2019-2020 school year consisted of a total of 163 students.http://www.vincentianacademy.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=191582&type;=d&pREC;_ID=387352 Academics As of 2019, Vincentian Academy claimed to maintain 100 percent university placement for its students. Vincentian was one of twelve schools in Pennsylvania that offers the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. The IB Program At Vincentian Academy, approximately 80 percent of all juniors and seniors took some IB courses. Overall, 84 percent of all those students taking IB exams pass. History The school was founded by the Vincentian Sisters of Charity in 1932 as Vincentian High School. (The Vincentian Sisters of Charity have since been incorporated into another congregation, the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth.) The high school began an affiliation with Duquesne University in 1995, whereupon it adopted the International Baccalaureate curriculum; the affiliation, during which the school was known as Vincentian Academy‚ÄìDuquesne University, ended in June 2010. Affiliation with Duquesne University Early in the 1990s, Duquesne University president Dr. John E. Murray was investigating the possibility of a high school for Duquesne, disturbed by contemporary reports that American high schools were inferior to schools in Europe, Asia, and even third-world countries. Reasoning that a university-affiliated school could be a model for the region and offer an advanced curriculum and integrate the resources of a major university into its operation, Murray explored the possibility as an extension of Duquesne's Spiritan tradition of often unconventional leadership. Dialogue with the Vincentian Sisters began in 1993; an agreement was finalized 1994, and the inaugurating class was set to enroll in 1995, with Dean Derek Whordley of the Duquesne University School of Education to be president of the new school. In September 1995, Vincentian Academy‚ÄìDuquesne University became officially operational, and 31 new Academy students were assimilated into the high school classes. A slow expansion was planned, with the new Academy gradually replacing the old Vincentian High School. The International Baccalaureate program was selected as the new Academy's curriculum because of its international appeal and academic quality. Moreover, it would be an attractive venue for university researchers and a unique experience for teachers. In adopting the IB, Vincentian Academy-Duquesne University became the only Catholic IB school in the world that was part of a major university. End of university affiliation In late January 2010, Duquesne University announced that it would be ending its 15-year partnership with Vincentian Academy. As such, Duquesne no longer has a part in performing administrative duties, and it does not determine a president for the school as before. The split became effective on June 30, 2010. Duquesne University had begun to provide administrative support services for Vincentian in 1995 for a five-year period, whereafter the partnership agreement was renewed in 2001 for a ten- year period. Academy principal Sister Camille Panich noted that the reasons for the partnership had been achieved: \\"Duquesne has helped strengthen the Academy and position it for long-term success\\". Duquesne University president Charles J. Dougherty likewise noted that \\"our partnership agreement for administrative services is concluding with a stronger Vincentian Academy\\". When the formal partnership ended, it was stated that some of the benefits that Duquesne University afforded to students, including use of the university's library and science facilities, would continue. Changes in administration model On March 11, 2016, Vincentian Academy principal Edward Bernot resigned to become the principal of Saint John Paul II Academy in Boca Raton, Florida. His term ended on June 2, 2016. His successor as principal of Vincentian Academy is former elementary school principal Rita Canton.

It served as a tank regiment in the Western Desert and Italian Campaigns in the Second World War, as a security force during the Greek Civil War, and as a heavy anti-aircraft artillery regiment postwar. Volunteers The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.Westlake. One such unit was the 39th (Liverpool Welsh) Lancashire RVC formed in the city of Liverpool on 9 February 1860 under the auspices of the Welsh Literary Society, following public meetings held in November 1859. The unit comprised clerks and bookkeepers and had an instalment plan so that less affluent members could purchase the necessary uniform (Volunteer grey with red facings) and pay the annual subscription. The unit elected its own officers, even though this was discouraged by the authorities. It consisted of a single company, drilling at the Welsh School in Russell Street, though a sub-division was later formed at Everton. It had a storehouse at 37 Russell Street and undertook musketry training at the Altcar Rifle Range. As a small corps the unit was included in the 2nd Administrative Battalion of Lancashire RVCs, which was consolidated as the 5th (Liverpool Rifle Volunteer Brigade) Lancashire RVC in March 1862, with the Liverpool Welsh forming No 5 (Welsh) Company.Beckett, pp. 49, 61, 175; Appendix VII.Frederick, p. 127.Westlake, pp. 148‚Äì9. The Liverpool Rifle Volunteer Brigade eventually became the 6th (Rifles) Battalion, King's Regiment (Liverpool) in the Territorial Force.Westlake, p. 141. World War II=Mobilisation As part of the modernisation of the Territorial Army (TA) in the years leading up to World War II, 7th Battalion King's Regiment (Liverpool) at Bootle was converted into 40th (The King's) Royal Tank Regiment (40th RTR) in 1938. After the Munich Crisis the TA was doubled in size, with existing units forming duplicates in 1939. The duplicate of 40th (King's) RTR was 46th (Liverpool Welsh) Royal Tank Regiment in Liverpool.7th Bn King's/40th RTR at Regiments.org.Liverpool Welsh at Regiments.org. Together with 40th RTR and 50th RTR (from Bristol) the regiment comprised 23rd Army Tank Brigade, based in Liverpool and serving in Western Command. The TA was embodied for active service at the outbreak of war on 3 September 1939.Joslen, p. 201.Western Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files.Southern Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. The brigade's title was changed to 23rd Armoured Brigade in November 1940 when it became part of a new 8th Armoured Division forming in Northern Command.Joslen, pp. 170‚Äì2.Joslen, p. 22. Western Desert A Valentine tank in the Western Desert, summer 1942. 8th Armoured Division embarked in May 1942 for the Middle East, 23rd Armoured Bde arriving at Suez in Egypt on 6 July. However, all the tanks had to go through the Base Ordnance Workshops, where considerable work had to be done on them. The brigade had received its tanks (44 Valentines and 6 Close Support Matildas for each armoured regiment) by 17 July, but they still had defects and deficiencies when they went into action five days later.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 260, 353. Because much of 8th Armoured Division had not arrived, 23rd Armoured Brigade was organised as an independent brigade group attached to 1st Armoured Division. Without any desert training, and in the unfamiliar role of 'Infantry tanks', it was given a task in the second phase of Eighth Army's attack on El Mreir (the Second Battle of Ruweisat Ridge). Although the previous night's operations had not fully cleared the minefield to their front, 23rd Armoured Bde advanced promptly at 08.00 on 22 July, the appearance of 40th and 46th RTR 'thundering past' distracting the German defenders of Point 63, who were captured by 1st Bn 2nd Punjab Regiment. 46th RTR advanced on the left, but struck the minefield and came under shell and anti-tank fire. After losing 13 tanks, the squadrons fanned out; some joined the equally shattered 40th RTR, some tried to work south of the El Mreir depression and were never seen again. At 11.00 the remains of the two regiments were counter-attacked by 21st Panzer Division and were ordered to withdraw. 'This gallant and disastrous action, on its first day of action cost the Brigade 203 casualties, with about 40 tanks destroyed and 47 badly damaged' [out of two regiments].Playfair, Vol III, pp. 354‚Äì6. 23rd Armoured Bde was in reserve for the Battle of Alam el Halfa on 31 August, and as the German Panzer attack developed, Gen Bernard Montgomery put it at the disposal of Lt-Gen Brian Horrocks' XIII Corps'. By 13.00 100 Valentines of the brigade had moved into the gap between 1st New Zealand Division and 22nd Armoured Bde and strengthened the position on the Alam el Halfa ridge. One squadron of 46th RTR supported 132nd Infantry Bde in an attempted counter-stroke at 22.30 on the night of 3/4 September. Unfortunately, 132nd Bde was nearly an hour late crossing its start line, and the New Zealanders had already attacked. 'The enemy was by then thoroughly aroused and met the advancing infantry with machine-gun and mortar fire. There was much straggling and general confusion, which took some time to sort out'. Rather than leave the troops in a very exposed position, the attackers were withdrawn before dawn. The Germans pulled back over the next few days.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 384, 387‚Äì90, Map 39. 23rd Armoured Bde was in XXX Corps' Reserve for the Second Battle of El Alamein,Joslen, p. 574. but in practice each of its regiments was assigned to one of the attacking divisions. When the assault went in on the night of 23/24 October most of the infantry and tanks got held up by mines short of their final objective line ('Oxalic'), but they had overcome the forward defences and lanes were being swept through the main minefieldsPlayfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 9, 37-9. The following days saw the 'dogfight' that Montgomery had predicted. On the night of 28/29 October the 9th Australian Division put in another set-piece attack. 46th RTR supported 26th Australian Brigade, with some of the infantry riding into battle on the Valentines. But the darkness, dust, and scattered mines frustrated the attempt to rush the enemy position. The tanks came under anti-tank and machine-gun fire, forcing the infantry to dismount and lose touch with the tanks. There was confused fighting, after which the infantry dug in, supported by the seven Valentines of 46th RTR that were still running (the regiment's casualties that night were 15 tanks knocked out, and many more damaged, but all were later recovered). Although the attack had fallen short of its ambitious objectives, it had punched a hole between 21st Panzer Division and 90th Light Division, effectively destroying II Bn of 125th Panzer Grenadier Regiment and a battalion of Italian Bersaglieri.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 58‚Äì9. After Alamein, 23rd Armoured Bde remained in Egypt to refit and did not take part in the pursuit. In December some of its units set off across North Africa, but 46th RTR was left behind, officially leaving the brigade on 1 December 1942. It remained in Egypt as part of Middle East Forces until after the conclusion of the Tunisian Campaign.Joslen, pp. 484‚Äì5. Sicily 46th RTR returned to 23rd Armoured Bde on 28 June 1943 in time for the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky). The brigade landed on Sicily on 10 July supporting XXX Corps, 46th RTR following 50th RTR in. On 12 July, as XXX Corps exploited its beachhead, the tanks advanced with 51st (Highland) Division through the ruins of Palazzolo Acreide and a group including two squadrons of 46th RTR reached the slopes facing the hill town of Vizzini by evening. The tanks demonstrated against Vizzini the following day until troops of 51st (H) Division arrived to begin the attack. The full attack went in at 01.00 the following morning to find that the defenders had retired. 51st H Division and 23rd Armoured Bde continued to advance north towards Patern√≤ against strengthening resistance, especially by units of the Hermann Goring Division around Gerbini Airfield. On the night of 20/21 July 7th Bn Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders attacked the airfield, covered by a squadron of 46th RTR, and captured it after three hours. But in fierce counter-attacks with infantry and tanks the enemy retook it by 10.30 the following morning. The squadron of 46th RTR lost eight tanks, including the squadron commander, Maj John Routledge, killed, and 51st (H) Division was forced onto the defensive.Molony, Vol V, pp. 9, 61, 82, 106, 115‚Äì7, Map 7.Routledge at CWGC. The division renewed its advance on the night of 31 July/1 August, working round Adrano and the west side of Mount Etna, as the Axis defenders were shepherded out of Sicily by 17 August.Molony, Vol V, pp. 158‚Äì9, 175‚Äì82, Map 11. Italy 23rd Armoured Brigade took part in the Salerno landings (Operation Avalanche) on 9 September, but 46th RTR was not in the leading waves that operated for some days as a composite force defending the beachhead and then led the dash for Naples.Molony, Vol V, pp. 276‚Äì8, 310, 314, 321, 335, 342‚Äì3. During October, the brigade advanced behind 7th Armoured Division. It then crossed to the Adriatic coast of Italy and joined V Corps. On 3 November it supported 78th Division's attack on Vasto held by 16th Panzer Division. At 04.30 two squadrons of 46th RTR helped 5th Bn Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment) and 6th Bn Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers to ascend the slope towards San Salvo. Although the advance seemed slow, it penetrated between two German battalions and the tanks pinned down II Bn 2nd Panzer Regiment. During the afternoon III Bn 2nd Panzer Regiment attempted a counter-attack but was stopped by 46th RTR and 'flailed' by the British artillery, after which the Germans withdrew to the Sangro River and the Gustav Line.Molony, Vol V, pp. 438, 460‚Äì1. Anzio Sherman tanks of 46th Royal Tank Regiment provide fire support for men of 1st Battalion, Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) at Anzio, 25 January 1944. The main campaign now bogged down during the winter of 1943/44. 46th RTR left 23rd Armoured Bde on 4 January 1944 and was attached to 1st Division, which was the British contribution to the Anzio landing (Operation Shingle). The division landed on 'Peter' Beach unopposed on 22 January and completed its unloading by the following morning. On 24 January it probed forward towards Albano. On 30 January 1st Division began its advance up the Via Anziate towards Campoleone, with 3rd Brigade accompanied by 46th RTR. At 15.15 1st Bn King's Shropshire Light Infantry (KSLI) on the right of the Via Anziate, 1st Bn Duke of Wellington's Regiment on its left, with B Sqn 46th RTR, began their advance, all went well to start with; the objectives were secured by 18.00 and the battalions consolidated. Next day, 2nd Bn Sherwood Foresters renewed the advance at 10.30 with C Sqn 46th RTR. Approaching a railway embarkment the infantry took heavy casualties from machine guns. Although they captured the embankment, it hindered the tanks, and the advance stalled. By the end of the two days 46th RTR had lost 11 Shermans. In the evening of 3 February the Germans began a series of counter-attacks to eliminate the Campoleone salient, and came close to cutting it off. In the afternoon of 4 February a reinforcing battalion, 1st Bn London Scottish was sent up with two squadrons of 46th RTR to keep open the Via Anziate. This 'most determined attack was successful', and the respite allowed 3rd Bde to be pulled back from the most dangerous positions. Faced by strong enemy forces, 1st Division had to prepare defences, with the battered 3rd Bde and 46th RTR in reserve.Molony, Vol V, pp. 649‚Äì51, 666‚Äì8, 674‚Äì7, 728‚Äì9, 732, Maps 37 and 38. The expected German counter-offensive began at 21.00 on 7 February. The first attack was brought to a standstill after tough fighting, then 3rd Bde counter-attacked towards the Buonriposo ridge with the KSLI and Foresters, supported by a squadron of 46th RTR. Although both battalions made some ground their losses were so high that they were stopped in insecure positions below the ridge. German attacks continued until 11 February when 1st Division was reinforced by US troops, and the fighting died down. There were further flare- ups throughout February, but a Trench warfare stalemate set in at Anzio after 3 March.Molony, Vol V, pp. 732‚Äì6, 757‚Äì8, Map 39. The breakout from Anzio began on 23 May, simultaneously with attacks northwards by Eighth Army and US Fifth Army.Molony, Vol VI, Pt I, pp. 228, 236. By 22 July, 46th RTR had rejoined 23rd Armoured Bde, which was resting and refitting in Palestine, and remained under its command until the end of the war. Greece On 19 August 1944, 23rd Armoured Bde under Brigadier Robert Arkwright was designated Force 140 and reorganised as an infantry brigade group for security duties in Greece (Operation Manna) should the Germans there withdraw. 46th RTR was split up into one squadron equipped with armoured cars, and two squadrons organised as infantry, one attached to 40th RTR and the other to 50th RTR (which were both organised as infantry). Force 140 was renamed 'Akforce' on 2 September and moved from Palestine to Egypt on 6 September.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 208‚Äì9, 322‚Äì5. The German withdrawal from Greece was well advanced by October, and Operation Manna began on 12 October with parachute landings by 2nd Parachute Bde. The following day Arkforce with troops and jeeps set sail from Alexandria aboard the cruisers HMS Ajax, HMS Aurora and HMS Black Prince, and began landing at Piraeus on 16 October. From 19 October 23rd Armoured Bde began operating ashore as a component of Arkforce).Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 433‚Äì41. An infantryman acts as 'tail end charlie', protecting the commander of a Sherman tank from ELAS snipers in Athens, 18 December 1944. 23rd Armoured Bde's role was to 'show the flag' in Athens, disarm the Greek security battalions established under German occupation, open up ports for relief supplies, and generally to act as arbitrators in local disputes. The units used their own transport to take supplies to outlying villages.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, p. 442. However, in December the former partisans of the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS) refused to be disarmed and clashes broke out with their rivals of the National Republican Greek League (EDES), the so- called Dekemvriana. On 5 December Arkforce was ordered to clear ELAS out of the Athens‚ÄìPiraeus area. 46th RTR was based at a barracks about 1 mile north of Lykabettos in the north of Athens, one squadron equipped with tanks that had now arrived, and one squadron with armoured cars. The operation began the next day, with two tank troops from 46th RTR assisting the 3rd Greek Mountain Brigade in clearing the Kouponia suburb. But ELAS strength continued to build up, and Arkforce was hard pressed to keep open communications with the government offices in Constitution Square and the base at Faliron Bay. 46th RTR's tanks were in constant demand for infantry support in the streets, while its scout cars and armoured command vehicles were organised into 'The Athens Taxi Service' to ferry senior officers and officials to and from Faliron past the ELAS-held Fix Brewery. The force commander, Lt-Gen Ronald Scobie, urgently requested reinforcements, including 35 additional Shermans to re-equip 46th RTR as a complete armoured regiment.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 18‚Äì9, 26‚Äì7, 73‚Äì84. A Humber armoured car supports paratroops during operations against ELAS in Athens, 6 January 1945. Operations from 9 to 17 December developed into a grim battle for the centre of Athens, while other troops fought to reopen the Piraeus docks. Arkforce was forced to abandon commitments outside the city, including withdrawing 46th RTR's administrative echelon from the Military Academy, where it had come under attack. Two of the regiment's armoured cars of the 'Athens Taxi Service' transported Gen Alexander and the British Minister, Harold Macmillan safely from the airfield to headquarters. They found the British force 'beleaguered' in the city with only three days' ammunition. However, the arrival of reinforcements by air and sea, including the first of the extra Shermans, allowed the force to keep open the lines of communication to the airfield and port, and a full corps HQ arrived to take over from Arkforce. The reinforcing infantry ('Blockforce') cleared the Piraeus peninsula with the help of 46th RTR's tanks to break down barricades. On the night 12/13 December ELAS made a converted effort to take the Constitution Square enclave, but the defenders held out. Supplies were scarce and nightly convoys up and down the Faliron road had to be escorted by the overworked tanks. However, by the night of 17/18 December operations began to advance up the road and link up the British positions, and bitter fighting went on into the new year. ELAS began withdrawing from central Athens on 27 December, and the British started an offensive on 2 January 1945, Arkforce striking northwards with 23rd Armoured Bde. ELAS retreated from Athens on 5 January, although fighting went on in other parts of the country.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 86‚Äì109. 46th (Liverpool Welsh) RTR remained in Greece until demobilisation after the end of the Second World War. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the regiment reformed in the Royal Artillery (RA) as 653rd (The Liverpool Welsh) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, with headquarters at Bluebell Lane, Huyton, Liverpool. In 1950 it amalgamated with 533rd Light Anti-Aircraft/Searchlight Regiment, RA, also based in Liverpool, to form 533rd (The Liverpool Welsh) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment. In 1955 this in turn was merged into the Liverpool-based 368th (4th West Lancashire) Medium Regiment, RA, in which it formed Q (Liverpool Welsh) Battery. The Liverpool Welsh title disappeared the following year when 368th Medium Regiment was amalgamated into its former parent regiment, 359th (4th West Lancashire) Medium Regiment.Frederick, pp. 1007‚Äì8, 1021, 1028.Anon, History, p. 196.Litchfield, pp. 127‚Äì9.638‚Äì677 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.

The highway primarily links up the towns of Chapel Hill, Hillsborough, and Yanceyville, along with providing a route between Chapel Hill and Virginia. Between Chapel Hill and Hillsborough, NC 86 serves as an alternative to I-40. Route description NC 86's northern terminus at the Virginia state line. NC 86 travels north from its southern terminus at US 15/US 501/NC 54 Bypass (Fordham Boulevard) in Chapel Hill, passing through the UNC campus and the town center. Exiting Chapel Hill into rural Orange County NC 86 meets I-40 before arriving in Hillsborough. There, the route meets I-85 and then joins NC 57 for about a mile through Hillsborough's central business district. Splitting to the northwest (signed north), NC 86 briefly joins NC 49 as they cross the Caswell County line. Entering the small community of Prospect Hill, NC 86 splits from NC 49 and travels north toward Yanceyville. Just outside Yanceyville, NC 86 joins US 158 and crosses NC 62\\\\. After passing through central Yanceyville, US 158 splits west while NC 86 continues north to the state line, where the route continues as State Route 86 and travels into Danville, Virginia. History Prior to 1940, this was numbered as NC 14\\\\. It was renumbered to match up with Virginia's Route 86\\\\. Simultaneous with that change, the old NC 65 was renumbered as NC 14\\\\. Old North Carolina Highway 86, (sometimes referred to as Old 86), is a highway that parallels NC 86\\\\. Heading from NC 54 near Carrboro, it follows northwest to Homestead/Dairyland Road near the unincorporated community of Calvander, it heads north paralleling I-40 until the intersection at exit 261. Then intersecting I-85, at exit 164, it ends at the intersection with US 70 Business, and NC 86\\\\. The highway was moved to the more heavily traveled corridor between Chapel Hill and Hillsborough in the 1950s. Major intersectionsSpecial routes=Hillsborough truck route North Carolina Highway 86 Truck (NC 86 Truck) is a bypass route for truck drivers that are traveling through the city of Hillsborough. This route goes west around the entire city, via I-85 (between exits 165 and 160), I-85 Connector and US 70\\\\. The routing is well marked throughout and there are warning signs for truck drivers, including \\"tolerance ends,\\" for that continue through the city.

Designed to accommodate arena football, hockey, basketball, concerts, and similar events, the facility was built at a cost of $178 million in public funds and $18 million in privately funded upgrades. Ground was broken on August 31, 2005 and a ribbon-cutting ceremony took place on August 30, 2008. Designed by C√©sar Pelli, the architect of the Petronas Towers in Malaysia, the BOK Center is the flagship project of Tulsa County's Vision 2025 long-range development initiative. Local firm, Matrix Architects Engineers Planners, Inc, is the architect and engineer of record. The arena is managed and operated by SMG and named for the Bank of Oklahoma, which purchased naming rights for $11 million. The only current permanent tenant is the Tulsa Oilers of the ECHL.The BOK Center was the former home of the Tulsa Shock of the Women's National Basketball Association and the Tulsa Talons of the Arena Football League. Design The arena's main lobby. Terrazzo flooring features Native American artwork. Tulsa city officials asked C√©sar Pelli to create an arena that would be an architectural icon. To achieve this, Pelli employed cultural and architectural themes of the city, including Native American, art deco, and contemporary styles. He made heavy use of swirling circular elements in the exterior and interior designs of the building. A , long glass facade featuring 1,600 panels wrap around the building in an escalating motion leaning at a five-degree angle. 33,000 stainless steel panels produced and installed by Zahner continue the upward spiraling path around the circumference of the structure. The interior follows the motion, with grand staircases that wrap around a portion of the building from the main lobby. In total, the building's design required of exterior stainless steel panels, of glass, of concrete, and 4,000 tons of structural steel. The arena encompasses and reaches a maximum height of . Inside, the bowl area's ceiling rises over the base floor and a -long HD ribbon screen wraps around the three-level seating area. There are 17,343 fixed seats, each ranging from to wide‚Äîan average width greater than the industry standard, including that of Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City. Actual capacity fluctuates with configuration patterns, and total seating can vary from 13,644 to 19,199‚Äî13,644 for partial-use concerts, 16,582 for arena football, 17,096 for hockey, 17,839 for basketball, and 19,199 for center stage concerts. The bowl area's second floor, an exclusive carpeted level with a complete bar, houses press areas and 37 luxury suites, each with 15 seats and furnished gathering and kitchen areas. In the main concourse, more than of terrazzo flooring has aggregate that contains 70% mother of pearl. Private funding exceeded original forecasts, and unexpected increases in revenue from corporate sponsorships, donations, and purchases of box seats and luxury boxes paid for an advanced light display for the glass wall that wraps around the front of the building and the scoreboard. The BOK Center's scoreboard was funded with $3.6 million in private donations. Amenities The BOK Center holds 37 public restrooms‚Äî12 men's restrooms, 16 women's restrooms, and 9 family restrooms‚Äîwith 300 toilets and urinals. Dressing rooms with wooden lockers, hydrotherapy and workout rooms, a players lounge, locker rooms for game officials, and office space for coaches, trainers, and equipment managers are also located within the building. The arena's hanging scoreboard, considered one of the most advanced in the country, is suspended above the arena floor and measures and , making use of four HD screens, four HD screens, a wrap-around HD screen, and another wrap-around HD screen. Designed by Forty Forty Agency and manufactured by Daktronics, the project received $3.6 million in private donations, with some funds going toward an advanced video recording system. There are 14 concession outlets, seven of which belong to Tulsa-area restaurants that supplement typical arena food. Restaurant branches within the building are Billy's On the Square (American fast-casual), Mazzio's, Papa John's, Doc Popcorn, and The Dog House (hot dogs). General concessions serve Mexican food at Wholly Tacomoli, stuffed pretzels and hot dogs at Backstage, gourmet hot dogs at Frank's, chicken baskets and baked potatoes at Fuel and chicken sandwiches and veggie burgers at Roadie's Grill. Nearly $1.5 million was allocated to artwork within the building in light of a city ordinance mandating that at least 1% of construction costs for any municipal project be used for public art. Tulsa's Arts Commission selected five artists out of nearly 300 applicants to decorate the interior of the building with the intention of capturing the spirit of the city and state. Of their pieces, the largest is a cloud-like cloth sculpture designed by Kendell Buster that weighs and hangs above the main concourse. Four Native American medallions designed by Bill and Demos Glass decorate the main concourse floor, along with a series of 25 paintings of tallgrass prairie landscapes created by Mark Lewis that adorn a wall on the main lobby's third level. A black-and-white painting of rearing horses created by Joe Andoe hangs on a wall near a concession stand on the north side of the building, and a light display created by Jenny Holzer is also within the arena. Ownership and management The city of Tulsa owns the arena but has a five-year management contract worth $950,000 with SMG property management, the largest arena manager in the world. SMG, which also manages the nearby Cox Business Center in addition to Chesapeake Energy Arena and Cox Convention Center in Oklahoma City, employs more than 70 full-time workers and 400 part-time workers in Tulsa and assumes the building's annual operations cost of $6,267,752. The current General Manager is Casey Sparks. History A public open house on August 30, 2008 served as the arena's opening event. A campaign promise by former Tulsa mayor Bill LaFortune to hold a municipal planning conference was fulfilled within months of taking office in 2002. Although voters rejected tax packages for arenas in 1997 and 2000, a third plan for a downtown arena was the brainchild of the conference, along with dozens of other projects throughout Tulsa County, including a renovation of the nearby Tulsa Convention Center costing $42 million. Vision 2025, a tax initiative increasing sales taxes by six-tenths of a cent over 13 years, was approved by voters in September 2003. Pelli's design was released in September 2004 and construction began in August 2005. Tulsa Vision Builders, a joint project of Tulsa-based Flintco and Manhattan Construction, was chosen to build the arena. Its original budget was deemed $141 million, but increases in the cost of structural steel, concrete, and labor due to Hurricane Katrina and a robust local economy pushed the cost to $178 million in 2006. An additional $18 million in private funding was used in miscellaneous upgrades, bringing the total cost of the arena to $196 million. Event history A ribbon-cutting ceremony involving Tulsa musicians Garth Brooks and Hanson took place on August 30, 2008. The arena's schedule of concerts and other events began on August 31 with a community choir hosted by Sam Harris. The first announced concert was on September 6, 2008 and featured the Eagles. Since its grand opening, the BOK Center has hosted many big-name acts such as Paul McCartney, Billy Joel, Elton John, U2, Justin Timberlake, Garth Brooks, Britney Spears, Janet Jackson, Lady Gaga, Guns N' Roses, Kenny Chesney, Bruce Springsteen, Twenty One Pilots, AC/DC, Metallica, Nine Inch Nails, Celine Dion, Taylor Swift, Brad Paisley, Dane Cook, Jonas Brothers, The Weeknd, and Panic! At The Disco. The Eagles also scheduled a rare second performance at the BOK Center after their first concert sold out in 35 minutes. In late 2008, BOK Center General Manager John Bolton was given Venues Today's \\"Hall of Headlines\\" award after a poll of venue managers, owners, operators and bookers determined that Bolton had the highest level of success in booking high-quality performances among international venues in 2008. On October 13, 2008, the NBA's Oklahoma City Thunder played the Houston Rockets in its first preseason game since leaving Seattle for Oklahoma and was the first major sporting event at the BOK Center. As of August 2008, the Thunder was seeking to play preseason games annually in Tulsa, although the number of games had not been determined. The next Thunder preseason game took place on October 3, 2017, against the Houston Rockets. The BOK Center is home to one minor league professional sports team, the Tulsa Oilers ice hockey team of the ECHL. The arena was formerly the home of the Tulsa Talons Arena Football League team from 2009 (while they were in the af2) to 2011. Also, the Tulsa Shock of the Women's National Basketball Association, previously known as the Detroit Shock, played all play their home games at the BOK Center from 2010 to 2015 before relocating to Dallas-Ft. Worth. In March 2010, the Conference USA Men's Basketball Tournament was held there. BOK Center later hosted second and third-round games in the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship on March 18 and 20, 2011. The Professional Bull Riders began hosting Built Ford Tough Series events at the BOK Center in 2009, after having previously occupied the Tulsa Convention Center. On June 20, 2020, current US President Donald Trump visited the BOK Center for a campaign rally. This was his first campaign rally in 110 days. The reported attendance turn out was seemingly \\"lower than expected,\\", though it attracted considerable cable news and political network ratings. Notable event facts Paul McCartney performed on August 17, 2009. The event launched the \\"One Year Birthday\\" celebration of the venue. The stop in Tulsa was McCartney's first in Oklahoma since 2002 and was the only arena show of his 2009 Summer Tour. McCartney also played at the venue on May 29 and 30, 2013 as part of his brand new tour, Out There! Tour. Events * Eagles: September 6, 2008 * Kenny Chesney September 10, 2008 * American Idols LIVE!

The arena was expected to host 148 major and minor events in its first year, which was anticipated to generate $1.5 million in tax revenue and $92 million in economic impact. SMG was expected to earn $6,553,250 in revenue, giving it a $285,498 annual profit. In its first four months of operation, BOK Center's ticket sales were nearly enough to reach Venues Today's top 20 worldwide rankings for total ticket sales in 2008 among venues seating 15,001-30,000. The arena reached $20 million in sales in 2008, and was projected to surpass at least $30 million in 2009, which would put it within the top 15 worldwide in sales according to the 2008 rankings. The arena won Facilities Magazine's Prime Site Award in 2008, which is based on opinions from representatives in the site selection industry, booking agents, promoters, talent buyers, and special event planners, who judge based on location, functionality, technical capabilities, quality of staff, food and beverage, lighting, sound, and staging. The arena was also one of four venues nominated for Pollstar's 2008 \\"Best New Major Concert Venue\\" award, which is set to be decided in January 2009. In its first three months of operation, the facility was featured or set to be featured in at least four major venue publications, including Venues Today, which gave its 2008 \\"Hall of Headlines\\" award to BOK Center manager John Bolton after a poll of venue managers, owners, operators and bookers determined that Bolton had the highest level of success worldwide in booking high-quality performances in 2008. In late 2008, a survey of BOK Center visitors found that 96.7% felt the building's overall impression, staff, concessions, merchandise, and traffic flow were favorable. The flowing design and acoustic properties of BOK Center have been praised by Tulsa Vision Builders, Tulsa city officials, and Garth Brooks. Officials from Flintco and Manhattan Construction have called the BOK Center one of the best architectural designs in their 100-year histories of building projects. The companies have worked on AT&T; Stadium, NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, Gallagher-Iba Arena at Oklahoma State University, Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City, the FedEx Forum in Memphis, Tennessee, and stadium renovations at the University of Oklahoma and OSU, among other projects. City officials have praised Pelli for the design, and Brooks, who held a 2007 concert at Kansas City's new Sprint Center, said at the BOK Center's grand opening, \\"You guys have got (the Sprint Center) beat hands down. It houses as many people, yet it's warm and small. It's as beautiful and grand as any place I've played.\\" Pelli reacted to the arena's completion by saying that it had taken a \\"life of its own\\" since he designed the building, but that the results were exciting and impressed him. He said the building has taken a form that pays tribute to Tulsa's art deco, the nearby Arkansas River, and the city's American Indian history, and anticipated that it would be a major catalyst for private development in Tulsa's downtown area. Transportation Streets bordering the BOK Center's back entrance are closed to traffic during events. City officials estimate there are 12,000 parking spaces within a 10-minute walk of the BOK Center with a city-owned parking garage diagonally across the street from the arena. During major events, Tulsa Transit runs free shuttle bus services to and from the arena and downtown Tulsa. Through a program instituted by the Tulsa Convention and Visitors Bureau, 50 guides are stationed within dozens of blocks of the arena during major events to help with parking and provide general information about shuttle services, events, and downtown Tulsa.

It is based on a short story by Ian McEwan published in collection First Love, Last Rites. It was made for the Scottish Television/Grampian Television New Found Land series, first shown by them on 3 October 2002. Co-financed by Channel 4, it was subsequently shown by them on 28 November 2002.Simon Coward, Richard Down & Christopher Perry The Kaleidoscope British Independent Television Drama Research Guide 1955‚Äì2010, Kaleidoscope Publishing, 2nd edition, 2010, page 2535, Production on an earlier BBC adaptation was halted at a late stage in 1979. Plot Phil (McGregor) is a successful advertising executive and Maisie (Millar) is his young and hedonistic wife, but their lives are thrown into turmoil when Phil inherits his great-great grandfather's secret diaries. He becomes obsessed with research into solid geometry contained in the diaries and is fascinated by the theory of \\"a plane without a surface.\\" His pursuit of this mythical geometric concept tears his marriage apart. The film is interspersed with flashbacks showing Phil's great-great grandfather discovering the same mysteries of the supernatural side of geometry as Phil is uncovering by reading the diaries. Eventually Phil follows the instructions buried in the diaries and begins carefully folding a large sheet of paper in on itself like a lotus flower, then the folded paper emits a bright light, folds over itself and disappears. On seeing this, he dedicates his life to understanding more about the diaries and his great-great grandfather's mysterious disappearance. He goes on to become obsessed with this transformation and the discussion in the book which links it to 'sexual intercourse positions' of which the diary claims there are only 17. After a love-making session with his wife, he proceeds to place another of the paper lotus flowers in the center of her curled body. As she curls into a foetal position unknowingly around the paper flower, she somehow completes the flower folding as had previously been achieved with just the paper. She spins around the paper flower several times and disappears, emitting tones of shock and fear. The film ends with Phil alone in bed.

His approach to classical saxophone playing differed from jazz and dance saxophone music popular at the time, and helped promote classical saxophone style in a mainstream medium. A writer in the Hollywood News said that \\"in Leeson's capable hands, the saxophone [is] no longer the blatant jazz instrument of popular conception, but an instrument of really beautiful tone color [...]. If there were other saxophonists who could play as Leeson does, the saxophone would speedily make its appearance in the symphony orchestra.\\" During the early 1930s, he joined the faculty at the Hollywood Conservatory of Music and taught there for several years.

It is intended to prevent brute-force attacks on SSH servers by monitoring invalid login attempts in the authentication log and blocking the originating IP addresses. DenyHosts is developed by Phil Schwartz, who is also the developer of Kodos Python Regular Expression Debugger. Operation DenyHosts checks the end of the authentication log for recent failed login attempts. It records information about their originating IP addresses and compares the number of invalid attempts to a user-specified threshold. If there have been too many invalid attempts it assumes a dictionary attack is occurring and prevents the IP address from making any further attempts by adding it to \`/etc/hosts.deny\` on the server. DenyHosts 2.0 and above support centralized synchronization, so that repeat offenders are blocked from many computers. The site denyhosts.net gathers statistics from computers running the software. DenyHosts is restricted to connections using IPv4. It does not work with IPv6. DenyHosts may be run manually, as a daemon, or as a cron job. Discoveries In July 2007, The Register reported that from May until July that year, \\"compromised computers\\" at Oracle UK were listed among the ten worst offenders for launching brute force SSH attacks on the Internet, according to public DenyHosts listings. After an investigation, Oracle denied suggestions that any of its computers had been compromised.John Leyden, Oracle refutes 'SSH hacking' slur.

They run laterally in a groove along the interior surface of the occipital bone. They drain from the confluence of sinuses (by the internal occipital protuberance) to the sigmoid sinuses, which ultimately connect to the internal jugular vein. See diagram (at right): labeled under the brain as \\"\\" (for Latin: sinus transversus). The transverse sinuses are of large size and begin at the internal occipital protuberance; one, generally the right, being the direct continuation of the superior sagittal sinus, the other of the straight sinus. Each transverse sinus passes lateral and forward, describing a slight curve with its convexity upward, to the base of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and lies, in this part of its course, in the attached margin of the tentorium cerebelli; it then leaves the tentorium and curves downward and medialward (an area sometimes referred to as the sigmoid sinus) to reach the jugular foramen, where it ends in the internal jugular vein. In its course it rests upon the squama of the occipital, the mastoid angle of the parietal, the mastoid part of the temporal, and, just before its termination, the jugular process of the occipital; the portion which occupies the groove on the mastoid part of the temporal is sometimes termed the sigmoid sinus. The transverse sinuses are frequently of unequal size, with the one formed by the superior sagittal sinus being the larger; they increase in size as they proceed, from back to center. On transverse section, the horizontal portion exhibits a prismatic form, the curved portion has a semicylindrical form. They receive the blood from the superior petrosal sinuses at the base of the petrous portion of the temporal bone; they communicate with the veins of the pericranium by means of the mastoid and condyloid emissary veins; and they receive some of the inferior cerebral and inferior cerebellar veins, and some veins from the diplo√´. The petrosquamous sinus, when present, runs backward along the junction of the squama and petrous portion of the temporal, and opens into the transverse sinus.

Written by Phil Klemmer and directed by Sarah Pia Anderson, the episode premiered on UPN on March 15, 2006. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica investigates a series of blackmailings and muggings primarily targeted against Neptune's LGBT community. Meanwhile, Logan (Jason Dohring) and Hannah's (Jessy Schram) relationship develops, and Keith (Enrico Colantoni) and Terrence (Jeffrey Sams) take on the latter's case.  Synopsis  While on his way to deliver a pizza, a pizza delivery boy gets stunned with a taser. Logan and Hannah's relationship develops, and she invites him to watch a movie at her house. Keith talks to Terrence about his case, and he says that he doesn't remember what he was doing at the time of the bus crash. A boy tells Veronica about the pizza boy muggings and also informs her that someone who is blackmailing gay students and outing them if they do not comply is behind the muggings. Veronica talks to the boy and another mugging victim, and their stories match up. The other victim says that he was headed to a classmate's house. Logan and Dick (Ryan Hansen) hang out to the exclusion of Hannah. Another girl, Kylie (Kristen Cavallari), asks Veronica for help with the blackmailing. Veronica learns that Keith is representing Terrence. Terrence reveals that he was probably at the casino at the time of the bus crash. However, obtaining the security footage will be difficult because of the casino owner's prejudice against Terrence. In class, on the class TV station, Kylie comes out to the whole school. Veronica talks to Carmen, and the pizza mugger used her name. However, she denies any knowledge. Veronica interrogates one of the victims, who is hesitant to her questions. Logan and Hannah have their date, and her father, Tom Griffith (Rick Peters), tells him to get out. Logan retorts by saying that he knows his testimony to his murder case is false. Keith talks to the casino owner, Leonard Lobo (Gil Birmingham) who eventually agrees to let Keith see the security tapes. After Logan leaves, Mr. Griffith has a talk with Hannah, presumably about Logan. Veronica waits at the pizza restaurant for the whole night. Keith gets surveillance tapes which show that Terrence was there and also learns that calls are blocked from inside the casino, proving that Terrence is innocent. Veronica and a pizza boy, Corny, catch a perpetrator, Arturo, who is not connected with the blackmailing. Veronica gets Mac to help her get a hard copy of the gay chat forum at Neptune High. Veronica tells one of the chatters that she thinks that the blackmailer is a person in the chat room. Hannah tells Logan that she knows about the Felix Toombs case, and Logan provides the evidence he knows against his guilt. Terrence tells Keith that his reputation would be damaged if it was found out that he was in a meeting with the casino owner. Veronica goes into the car of one of the victims she talked to earlier, and he admits to being part of the scheme. Hannah checks her father's messages and belongings, and they match up with what Logan was saying about her father's cocaine addiction and connection with the Fitzpatrick's. Kylie was actually behind the whole scheme in order to save money for college. Hannah reconciles with Logan. Jackie drives Veronica to a basketball game. Keith and Terrence talk to Sheriff Lamb and eventually attempt to blackmail him with a tape of Lamb blackmailing Terrence. However, he doesn't give in to them. While returning Terrence's car, Jackie (Tessa Thompson) and Veronica find explosives and detonators in his garage, and Veronica tells Keith about it.  Cultural references  The following cultural references are made in the episode: *The episode references O.J. Simpson. *The girls taunt Marlena by comparing her to the Indigo Girls. *Veronica says that her and Jackie's relationship \\"isn't exactly The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.\\" *Dick compares Veronica to \\"rich-dude Kryptonite\\". *Arturo calls Corny \\"Shaggy\\". *Terrence compares himself to Pete Rose. *The blackmailer uses the email alias Rick Santorum.* *Lamb sarcastically says that Terrence and Keith are performing a Jedi mind trick. *Veronica and Jackie compare Wallace to Michael Jordan.  Arc significance  *Logan tells Dr. Griffith that if he wants Logan to stay away from Hannah, he'll have to drop his testimony. *Hannah's father tells her about what he \\"saw\\" Logan do on the bridge. Logan tells her that her father is a cokehead and lying for the Fitzpatricks, and implores her to \\"look around the house.\\" Hannah finds coke in the bathroom and a number of calls to and from the Fitzpatricks and The River Styx. *Keith finds out that Terrence Cook was at the Seven Rivers Casino at the time of the bus crash and couldn't have used his cell phone. *Keith brings this information to Sheriff Lamb and tries to browbeat him into letting Terrence off the hook by playing the recording of Lamb blackmailing Terrence. Lamb doesn't see the leverage as equal and refuses to drop the charges. *At the end of the episode, Veronica finds explosives and detonators in the hangar Terrence uses to store his cars. *It is mentioned that Peter Ferrer was a member of the message board and that one of his last posts was about a very big outing to occur in Neptune.  Music  The following music is heard in the episode: *\\"On the 54\\" by The Dandelions *\\"This Machine Alone\\" by the Fighting Brothers McCarthy *\\"Cinnamon Sky\\" by Karin Brennan *\\"I Don‚Äôt Know\\" by Starsailor  Production  Kristin Cavallari guest starred in the episode. \\"Versatile Toppings\\" was written by Phil Klemmer and directed by Sarah Pia Anderson, marking Klemmer's ninth writing credit and Anderson's second and final directing credit (after \\"Return of the Kane\\"). The episode features a guest appearance by Kristin Cavallari, who plays Kylie, a closeted lesbian cheerleader about whom it is eventually learned that she was the perpetrator in the case-of-the week. Then best known for her role on Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County, Cavallari's guest spot on the show was announced several months prior. Entertainment Weekly expressed surprise over the decision to cast Cavallari, writing that \\"It's hard to believe a teen as brainy as sleuth Veronica Mars lives on the same planet as the clique from Laguna Beach.\\"  Reception = Ratings  In its original broadcast, \\"Versatile Toppings\\" received 2.73 million viewers, marking an increase from the previous episode, \\"Ain't No Magic Mountain High Enough\\".  Reviews  Television Without Pity gave the episode a \\"B\\". Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a moderately positive review, while saying that it paled in comparison to \\"Ain't No Magic Mountain High Enough\\". \\"After all, both \\"Magic Mountain\\" and \\"Versatile Toppings\\" are straightforward episodes that easily could have fit in with season one apart from that, and the former is fantastic, while this one is solid. So I'm glad those constraints have been loosened, although given this season's forays into insanity, I may live to regret that.\\" Price Peterson, writing for TV.com, gave a more mixed review, writing that \\"The gay subplots of this show continue to trouble me a bit, specifically in this one- step-forward, two-steps-back episode.\\" However, the reviewer also stated that \\"the surprising saving grace of this episode was Logan and Hannah's developing relationship.\\"  References  External links  * *\\"Versatile Toppings\\" at Mars Investigations Category:2006 American television episodes Category:Veronica Mars (season 2) episodes ","title":"Versatile Toppings"},{"id":"4469851","text":"The 44th Royal Tank Regiment (44 RTR) was an armoured regiment of the British Army, which was part of the Royal Tank Regiment, itself part of the Royal Armoured Corps that saw active service in World War II. The 44th RTR was formed before World War II in 1938 from the 6th Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment. When war was declared on 3 September 1939 44th RTR was in Bristol, attached to 21st Army Tank Brigade at the time, with the 42nd and 48th RTR. The battalion then went to the Middle East in April 1941 and by the time of Operation Crusader, November 1941, 1st Army Tank Brigade, equipped with Valentine tanks, along with 8th and 42nd RTR, supporting 2nd New Zealand Division, contributing to the Divisions stand against the German and Italian armoured attacks on 30 November 1941. It was still part of 1st Army Tank Brigade when the Germans and Italians attacked at Gazala in May 1942 and also in the Cauldron battles of that campaign. It then supported the Australians during the withdraw during the 'Gazala Gallop' and again during the First Battle of El Alamein. It was then withdrawn from the line for re-equipping although a small number of it troops used mine sweeping Matilda (Scorpion) tanks during the Second Battle of El Alamein. In June 1943, the battalion became part of 4th Armoured Brigade for the invasion of Sicily and the also for the brigade's part in the Italian Campaign. It, with the rest of 4th Armoured Brigade, withdrew from Italy in January 1944 to return to the United Kingdom ready for the Normandy landings, where it arrived on 9 June 1944. After the Operation Overlord in Normandy, it took part in the break-out and reached the River Scheldt by 9 September 1944. On 17 September it came under the command of the US 101st Airborne Division as part of Operation Market Garden, before returning to the 4th Armoured Brigade. In April 1945 the regiment helped 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division in the capture of Bremen. It then moved via Hamburg to begin its occupational role to Uetersen on 9 May 1945. The regiment was amalgamated with 50th RTR to form 44th/50th RTR and on 31 October 1956, the new regiment was further amalgamated with the North Somerset Yeomanry, to form the North Somerset Yeomanry/44th Royal Tank Regiment, which has since become the North Somerset and Bristol Yeomanry.

He is generally believed to be the officer responsible for the death of President Venustiano Carranza. Biography In early 1920, Herrero was a rebel commander subordinate to General Manuel Pelaez. However, in March 1920, he surrendered to Carranza's forces under the promise of amnesty and he was allowed to keep his rank of General. In May 1920, Carranza's government collapsed under pressure from forces supporting √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n. Carranza and his supporters attempted to flee Mexico City to Veracruz. At the Aljibes rail station, they were informed that the rail line had been severed and that Veracruz had fallen. So Carranza proposed to travel on foot north to San Luis Potos√≠. It was near the rural village of La Union that Carranza's small party was joined by the forces of Rodolfo Herrero. Herrero offered to guide and escort Carranza's party through the rugged rural area of northern Puebla. He escorted the party to the small settlement of Tlaxcalantongo. Herrero then excused himself by saying he had to attend to a wounded brother Hermilo Herrero, but promised to return. In the early morning of May 21, 1920, Carranza's party was attacked by soldiers believed to be under the command of the Herrero brothers. When the dawn came, Carranza was discovered dead from several bullet wounds. Rodolfo Herrero was ordered to Mexico City for questioning. Obreg√≥n denounced him for murder and treason. In the Capital, Herrero was questioned at length but not held. Seven months later, he was confined for a week in the military prison of Santiago Tlaltelolco. He was stripped of his military rank and cashiered out of the army, but otherwise allowed to go free. Herrero was subsequently reinstated as a general during the presidency of Obreg√≥n, only to be dismissed again during the presidency of L√°zaro C√°rdenas in 1937. His brother Hermilo Herrero joined forces with Francisco \\"Pancho\\" Villa. Slowly moving up the ranks and eventually becoming a general for the Villa army. He died of natural causes in 1964. He always denied that Carranza was murdered. He espoused the alternative theory that Carranza after being wounded in the leg had committed suicide as stated by several eyewitnesses including Paulino Fontes, Manuel Aguirre, Pedro gil Farias and Ignacio Suarez. This theory presumes that general Basave y Pi√±a never intended to kill Carranza but to capture him.

Beaumont once served as the magnet middle school for the Osceola County region. Other students, many under protest, were relegated to Denn John Middle School, located on the outskirts of Kissimmee, FL, while Beaumont celebrated its proximity to the seat of Osceola County government and center of its commerce at Lat: 28.29528 Lon: -81.41056.  History  Beaumont was built a few blocks from Lake Toho and downtown Kissimmee, at the corner of Beaumont and Sumner St. Classes ceased in the main High School building in 1975. During the 1974-1975 school year, the student body was cut in half, with those generally north and east of the campus being assigned to the new Denn- John school which was under construction. Those assigned to Denn-John were placed in classrooms in the old original Osceola High School building, and those assigned to stay at Beaumont Middle occupied the newer section of campus. Common areas such as the cafeteria, shop, PE and Home Ec. were shared. Each school had its own office and administrators, the office for Denn John being in the Old building. In January 1975, the new Denn-John middle school campus was completed, and all the students assigned to that school moved to the new campus. At that time the Original Osceola High School building was no longer being used for students. The School Districts Audio-visual department and 16MM film library continued to be housed at that site, as it had been for several years prior to the closure to students in 1975. The property however remained in use by the county as a textbook storage facility and by truant students looking for a quick smoke. Recently, the location was investigated by treasure hunters, who found many unique items, but no American Civil War musket balls.  Decline and abandonment  In 1998, Beaumont closed its doors to the youth of Kissimmee. The county purchased the property and many of the Beaumont buildings were torn down, lost forever. Others were renovated by the county and now serve as a new middle school. property appraiser.

In January 2008 he was replaced as captain of Italy's national team. Club career Bortolami began his playing career with the team of his native Padua, making his debut in the second row aged just 18. In the summer of 2006 he joined English Premiership side Gloucester Rugby when he was considered by many top judges to be one of the best players in the world around the time, and stepped straight into the starting team for their first game of the season, immediately taking the role of captain. He made a formidable partnership with Alex Brown and shared captaincy with Peter Buxton. Due to injuries and World Cup commitments, the 2007‚Äì08 season wasn't as consistent and he lost the Italian captaincy to Italian No. 8 Sergio Parisse, but continued to put in powerful performances for Gloucester. His outstanding leadership qualities meant he kept the captaincy last year and by the end of the season he was back to his formidable best. He made 23 appearances for Gloucester in 2008‚Äì09. In 2010 he returned to Italy signing for the new Aironi team which started to compete in the Celtic League from the 2010‚Äì11 season. After Aironi folded due to financial problems, Bortolami signed for the new franchise Zebre in the Pro12 for the 2012/13 season. On 7 May 2016, Bortolami announced his retirement from professional rugby with immediate effect. International career Bortolami was soon made captain of Italy's Under-21 side, before making his full international debut against Namibia in June, 2001, when he was just 20. At the age of 22, Bortalami was made Italy's youngest ever captain. In his first-ever World Cup start ‚Äì against Tonga in 2003 ‚Äì he picked up an injury and missed the decisive match against Wales, which saw the Azzurri eliminated from the competition. After impressing in the 2004 Six Nations Championship, he was once again awarded the captaincy for the 2005 Summer tour of Japan. After the tour he joined French club Narbonne. In the 2007 Six Nations Championship, Bortolami led Italy to their first away win in the competition against Scotland at Murrayfield, which was also the first time Italy have won more than one game in a single Six Nations Championship.

Mutations in the NOTCH2 gene, identified in 2011, cause HCS. HCS is so rare that only about 50 cases have been reported worldwide since the discovery of the syndrome in 1948 Signs and symptoms Hajdu‚ÄìCheney syndrome causes many issues with an individual‚Äôs connective tissues. Some general characteristics of an individual with Hajdu‚ÄìCheney syndrome include bone flexibility and deformities, short stature, delayed acquisition of speech and motor skills, dolichocephalic skull, Wormian bone, small maxilla, hypoplastic frontal sinuses, basilar impression, joint laxity, bulbous finger tips and severe osteoporosis. Wormian bone occurs when extra bones appear between cranial sutures. Fetuses with Hajdu‚ÄìCheney syndrome often will not be seen to unclench their hands on obstetrical ultrasound. They may also have low-set ears and their eyes may be farther apart than on a usual child, called hypertelorism. Children's heads can have some deformities in their shape and size (plagiocephaly). Early tooth loss and bone deformities, such as serpentine tibiae and fibulae, are also common in those affected. Genetics Hajdu‚ÄìCheney syndrome has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Hajdu‚ÄìCheney syndrome is a monogenic disorder. The disorder is inherited and controlled by a single pair of genes. A single copy of the mutant gene on an autosome causes HCS. HCS is an autosomal dominant disorder, only one parent with the defective gene is needed to pass the disorder to the offspring. Mutations within the last coding exon of NOTCH2 that remove the PEST domain and escape the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay have been shown to be the main cause of Hajdu‚ÄìCheney syndrome. The NOTCH2 gene plays a very important role in skeletogenesis. Mutations of NOTCH2 that seem to cause HCS occur in the last coding exon of the gene (exon 34). These mutations remove PEST domains, which mediate proteosomal destruction of the protein. These PEST domains are removed due to the premature stop codon in the amino acid sequence. All HCS alleles are observed to have premature protein destruction before the PEST sequence is fully translated. The result is a mature NOTCH2 gene with a partially completed PEST sequence. In some cases, no PEST sequence at all is seen. This leads to the no proteosomal destruction of the protein. The NOTCH2 gene is ubiquitously expressed in all embryonic tissue. When researching HCS in mice, the homozygous deletion of NOTCH2 leads to death. This observation is important because it explains how the HCS phenotype is not isolated to only one system of the body. NOTCH2 is also shown to regulate RANK-L osteoclastogenesis, which is the production of functional osteoclasts. Osteoclasts are the component that breaks bone down. This is why bone loss is observed in HCS patients, due to the overactivation of RANK-L. Pathogenesis The mechanism thought to cause HCS is an abnormality in osteoblast and osteoid function. These are major components of bone development, and the low function of each leads to the weak bones that characterize HCS. Diagnosis One of the main methods of pinpointing a NOTCH2 mutation that leads to HCS is through whole genome sequencing. This is then followed by exome capture by means of in-solution hybridization. The exome part of the genome consists of exons. Parallel sequencing follows the hybridization, which results in about 3.5 Gb of sequence data. These sequence data are then analyzed. Through sequence analysis and symptom presentation in HCS patients, this proves to be the most definitive method of diagnosis. Types Laboratory testing reveals multiple mutations of HCS. Two genetic variants result in sporadic HCS symptoms, which are HCS-02 and HCS-03. These mutations produce symptoms that come and go, but have been present de novo. HCS-03 was identified as the variant that is passed through afflicted family members and presents symptoms throughout the lifetime of the individual. All variants of HCS lead to the same premature termination of PEST sequences which compromise normal function of NOTCH2. NOTCH has four different receptors, which have an affinity for similar ligands. They are classified as single-pass transmembrane receptors. Treatment Since about 2002, some patients with this disorder have been offered drug therapy with bisphosphonates (a class of osteoporosis drugs) to treat problems with bone resorption associated with the bone breakdown and skeletal malformations that characterize this disorder. Brand names include Actonel (risedronate/alendronate), made by Merck Pharmaceuticals. Other drugs include Pamidronate, made by Novartis and Strontium Ranelate, made by Eli Lilly. However, for more progressive cases, surgery and bone grafting are necessary. Eponym It is named after Nicholas Hajdu (1908‚Äì1987), a Hungarian-English radiologist working in the UK and William D.

There, the crews began training on Grant tanks, but by September they were equipped with a mix of Sherman tanks (codenamed 'Swallows') and Crusaders, but was not apparently brought up to full establishment.45 RTR War Diary, May‚ÄìSep 1942, The National Archives, file WO 169/4522. 8th Armoured Division was not yet complete, so 24th Armoured Brigade was attached to 10th Armoured Division for the forthcoming Second Battle of El Alamein.Joslen, pp. 22, 173, 565.45 RTR War Diary, Oct 1942, The National Archives, file WO 169/4522. 45 RTR went into action alongside 41 and 47 RTR on the second day of the battle (D+1, 24 October), as 10th Armoured pushed towards Miteira. Its tanks engaged enemy anti-tank guns and entrenched infantry before withdrawing at dusk. The next day (D+2), 45 RTR moved into battle positions, supporting 41 and 47 RTR with gunfire. The enemy anti-tank guns were well dug in and had to be engaged by observing their flashes. One German infantry post was overrun by a troop of tanks firing their machine-guns into the trenches. The regiment withdrew again at dusk, leaving one defence squadron on the ridge. On D+3, there was confused fighting ahead of the regiment. During D+4, 45 RTR remained on the ridge all day, covering 41 and 47 RTR as they advanced through the gaps in the minefields. On the night of 27/28 October, the CO was ordered to advance at first light on D+5 to support an infantry brigade, but as the regiment only had about 20 tanks, 41 RTR was ordered to make up the numbers. The Crusader squadron had only gone a few hundred yards when it came upon some infantry digging in, and stopped. But Dumbreck had been told that the infantry he was supporting had definitely reached their objective, so one of the Sherman squadrons pushed on towards the ridge SE of the feature known as 'Snipe', supported by the other, which engaged German tanks coming from Snipe. It emerged that the infantry had not achieved their objective, and 45 RTR withdrew under shellfire. During this unsatisfactory action, the regiment lost 10 tanks and suffered 11 men killed or died of wounds, 10 missing believed dead, and 34 wounded, mainly from mines and shellfire. At the end of the day, 45 RTR handed its remaining tanks over to other regiments and was withdrawn into reserve. After the battle, 45th (Leeds Rifles) RTR was sent a message of congratulations from the Lord Mayor of Leeds,45 RTR War Diary, Nov 1942, The National Archives, file WO 169/4522. but the regiment had fought its only battle. Over succeeding months, 24 Armoured Bde's officers and men were progressively posted away to other units.45 RTR War Diary, Dec 1942, The National Archives, file WO 169/4522. However, the planned dispersal of 45 RTR was cancelled, and it took in the remaining details of 41 and 47 RTR to become a holding unit. In this role, it received large drafts of reinforcements from the United Kingdom before they were posted to other regiments. Nevertheless, on 8 March 1943, 45 RTR was finally disbanded and replaced by a Royal Armoured Corps holding unit.45 RTR War Diary, Jan‚ÄìMar 1943, The National Archives, file WO 169/9374. Postwar When the Territorial Army was reformed after the war, it included a combined 45th/51st (Leeds Rifles) RTR. The personnel received their tank training from 'A' Sqn of 6 RTR at RAF Worksop.http://rafworksop.btck.co.uk/BaseHistory/1945-1951 Brigadier Noel Tetley was the honorary colonel. In 1956, the 45th/51st (Leeds Rifles) RTR returned to the infantry role under its old title of 7th (Leeds Rifles) Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment. It carried the honorary distinction on its colours and appointments of the badge of the Royal Tank Regiment with dates '1942-45' and two scrolls inscribed 'North Africa' and 'Italy' (51 RTR fought in the Italian Campaign).

The White Dragon is directed by Wilson Yip, whose best known works to date are Bullets Over Summer, Juliet in Love and SPL: Sha Po Lang. It stars Cecilia Cheung as Phoenix Black, a pretty, young, and vain student who thinks she has what it takes to woo the most desirable eligible bachelor in the land, Second Prince Tian Yang (Andy On). Plot In a twist departing from the standard superhero formula, White Dragon is a narcissist, forever worried about her good looks, even as she's fighting with Feather, a blind assassin nicknamed \\"Chicken Feathers\\" because of his propensity for using chicken feathers as his calling card. Chicken Feathers is first challenged by White Dragon, an elderly woman with proficient skills in martial arts to almost match his, but not quite enough. Thinking that she has been fatally wounded, White Dragon transfers her kung-fu knowledge into empty shell Black Phoenix, turning the young woman into the prettiest martial arts expert around. The downside to having these extraordinary powers, which she does not fully understand, is bad acne, which she manages to prevent only by doing \\"noble\\" deeds like robbing from the rich and giving to the poor. Phoenix is reluctant to take on her new role at first, but soon becomes interested in tracking down Chicken Feathers when she learns that her love interest, Second Prince Tian Yang, might become his next target. Using her flute-playing as bait, White Dragon finally faces Chicken Feathers in an attempt to defeat him before he can carry out the assassination. Chicken Feathers proves to be too good for the new White Dragon, however. When White Dragon tries to exploit his \\"weak points,\\" she ends up injured(breaking her leg while trying to kick Feathers in the nuts) and dependent on Feathers, who does nurse her back to health after their heated battle. While Chicken Feathers plays nurse, White Dragon seeks to find his true weak point to stop him once and for all. What she finds instead is that Chicken Feathers has fallen in love with her, and that he is growing on her as well. After a while her leg healed and Chicken Feathers found a letter for Second Prince Tian Yang and had it read by the town's doctor. This letter made Chicken Feathers thinking that Black Phoenix already has a boyfriend, namely the Second Prince Tian Yang. Chicken Feathers confronted Phoenix Black with this and they ended up struggling. Accidentally the girl stabbed her flute into the back of Chicken Feathers, which gave him a moment of sight. She ran away. The Third Prince, brother of the Second Prince, apparently hired Chicken Feathers to kill his brother, this was revealed at the very last scene.

The academy was established in 1946 in an attempt to continue the tradition of the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Brandenburg Society of Sciences, founded in 1700 by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. The academy was a Learned society (scholarship society), in which awarded membership via election constituted scientific recognition. Unlike other academies of science, the DAW was also the host organization of a scientific community of non-academic research institutes. Upon German reunification, the Academy's Learned society was dissociated from its research institutes and any other affiliates and eventually dissolved in 1992. Activities of the AdW's members and college have since 1993 been continued by the newly established Leibniz Scientific Society (Leibniz-Soziet√§t der Wissenschaften). The AdW's pending and unfinished research projects and holdings were forwarded to and are carried out by the 1992 established Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities. The academy's countless institutes were dissolved on December 31, 1991 and partially reorganized into other organizations such as the Leibniz Association, the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres, the Max Planck Society and the Fraunhofer Society. A number of minor institutes and associated projects have been preserved and were transferred to other institutions such as the German Archaeological Institute.  DAW (1946‚Äì1972)  The German Academy of Sciences at Berlin was the successor to the Brandenburg Society of Sciences, that had been founded by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the year 1700. After the end of World War II, it was re-established upon the SMAD Order No. 187 of July 1, 1946, Leibniz's 300th birthday. The Academy was to become the most eminent scientific institution in Germany. Reorganisation was greatly influenced by the ideas of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. To facilitate publishing, the Akademie Verlag was founded in 1946. The 250th anniversary in 1950 was boycotted by West Germany in protest of the overwhelming influence of the East German authorities. The Socialist Unity Party of East Germany had embraced the two-nation doctrine and increasingly enforced its will upon the electorate to have mostly East Germans elected to the academy in the following decades.  AdW (1972‚Äì1989)  The institution became the most eminent academy of the German Democratic Republic, and was accordingly renamed Academy of Sciences of the GDR (Akademie der Wissenschaften der DDR - AdW) in 1972, once the division of Germany was accepted as the state of affairs. In the 1980s, the AdW itself had grown to accommodate over 200 members, including around two dozen West German scientists. The academy coordinated research of 59 institutes that employed 22,000 persons.  Unwinding and Re-establishments (1989‚Äì1993)  Following the fall of the Berlin wall, academy members called for a reform of the academy, rejecting the leading role of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. On 27 June 1990, the new GDR government reorganized the academy, turning it into a public instutition. Until late 1991, the former AdW institutes were separated from the academy, evaluated, and either dissolved or assigned to different organisations, mainly the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community. As the states of Berlin and Brandenburg considered a continuation of the academy as improper due to its role in the GDR, the academy, which had then about 400 members, was disbanded and the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities was established in 1993. On 15 April 1993, 60 of the former academy members created the private organisation Leibniz-Soziet√§t which claims to represent 300 years of continuous academic tradition. It has now over 300 members, of which most were elected since 1994.

The area returned to Romanian administration following the Axis Powers' invasion of the Soviet Union in July 1941. A military administration was established and the region's Jewish population was either executed on the spot or deported to Transnistria, where further numbers were killed. As the Soviet Union's offensive pushed the Axis powers back, the area again was under Soviet control. On September 12, 1944, Romania signed the Moscow Armistice with the Allies.

Commissioned to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the October Revolution, The End of St Petersburg was to be one of Pudovkin's most famous films and secured his place as one of the foremost Soviet montage film directors. The film forms part of Pudovkin's 'revolutionary trilogy', alongside Mother (1926) and Storm Over Asia (aka The Heir to Genghis Khan) (1928). The End of St. Petersburg is a political film, explaining why and how the Bolsheviks came to power in 1917. The film covers the period from about 1913 to 1917. The film does not show the political figures of the time; the emphasis is on the struggle of ordinary people for their rights and for peace against the power of capital and the autocracy. The film inspired the composer Vernon Duke to write his eponymous oratorio (completed in 1937). A simple peasant boy arrives in St. Petersburg to obtain employment. Fate leads him to a factory where there are severe, almost slave- like working conditions. He unwittingly helps in the arrest of an old village friend who is now a labor leader. He attempts to fix his wrongdoing but ends up in a fight and then arrested. His punishment is being sent to fight in World War I. After three years, he returns ready for revolution.

Origin and training As part of the rearmament of the British Army before World War II, the 6th Battalion Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, a Territorial Army infantry battalion, was converted to the armoured role on 1 November 1938, under the designation 43rd (6th City) Battalion, The Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, Royal Tank Regiment, or '43 RTR' for short. During 1939, it also formed 49th Royal Tank Regiment as a duplicate regiment.https://web.archive.org/web/20051227035638/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil- england/vinf-no/nd-6.htm The regiments shared St George's Drill Hall in Newcastle upon Tyne as their depot.43 RTR War Diary August 1939, The National Archives, Kew, file WO 166/1414.Scull Both regiments were part of 25th Army Tank Brigade.Joslen, p. 203. At the end of May 1940, with the British Expeditionary Force being evacuated from Dunkirk and the imminent threat of German invasion of England, 25th Army Tank Brigade was redesignated 2nd Motor Machine Gun Brigade and its regiments reorganised accordingly. Each MMG squadron consisted of three troops, each with six Austin Utility ('Tilly') two-seat cars, two carrying medium machine guns, two Bren light machine guns and two Boys anti-tank rifles.Joslen pp. 203, 211.Scull. In July 1940, volunteers from the units of 25th Army Tank Brigade formed No. 5 Troop of No. 5 Commando at Bridlington.2nd Motor Machine Gun Brigade War Diary October‚ÄìDecember 1940, The National Archives, Kew, file WO 166/1135. In November 1940, 43 RTR moved south and was attached to 21st Army Tank Brigade. Although still organised as an MMG battalion, it did begin to receive a few Matilda II tanks and Light Dragons (tracked artillery tractors) for training, later followed by a mixture of Vickers Medium Mark Is and Mk IIs, Matilda Mk IIAs and Vickers Light Mk VIBs.43 RTR War Diary November 1940‚ÄìFebruary 1941, The National Archives file WO 166/14/14.Joslen, p. 200. By the end of March 1941, 43 RTR had reached its full establishment of 50 tanks and rejoined 25th Army Tank Brigade, now reconverted from the MMG role to train in the infantry tank role on the South Downs. The battalion's operational assignment was to cooperate with 125 Infantry Brigade, which in turn was converted to a tank brigade later in the year.43 RTR War Diary March‚ÄìApril 1941, The National Archives file WO 166/14/14.Joslen, pp. 164, 203, 310. In October 1941, 43 RTR was transferred to 33rd Tank Brigade, which was being formed in the Dukeries area of Nottinghamshire to supervise the training of infantry battalions converting to tanks. 43 RTR was stationed at Welbeck Abbey, where it provided training courses for the other battalions in the brigade: 144th and 148th Regiments Royal Armoured Corps. The brigade was equipped with Churchill tanks, replacing 43 RTR's Matildas.Joslen, p 206.43 RTR War Diary October‚ÄìDecember 1941, The National Archives file WO 166/1414.144 RAC War Diary November 1941, The National Archives file WO 166/1433. Throughout 1942, training continued, first at Welbeck, later at Berkhamsted. In November 1942, 43 RTR formed a special squadron ('X' Sqn) equipped with modified Churchills, to take part in Exercise Trent II, testing the practicalities of disembarking from Landing Craft Tank LCTs on Pendine Sands on the South Wales coast.43 RTR War Diary November 1942, The National Archives file WO 166/6918. Specialised armour Turretless Matilda Baron under test - 13 August 1943. In February 1943, 43 RTR was ordered to mobilise for overseas service and received new Churchill tanks. Next, the orders were changed to mobilisation for a tropical climate with Sherman tanks. Then the orders were changed again, and 43 RTR was earmarked for 'very special training' with 79th Armoured Division,Joslen, pp. 31, 206. which was developing all kinds of specialised armoured vehicles for use in the Normandy Landings. 43 RTR was made responsible for training Armoured Assault Regiments of the Royal Engineers (RE) on Matilda and Valentine tanks. When 33 Tank Bde moved to Scotland, 43 RTR remained behind at the Orford Battle Range directly under 79 Division HQ as a trials and demonstration unit, with A Sqn experimenting with Wasps (Universal Carriers equipped with flamethrowers), B Sqn with Matilda Barons (turretless tanks equipped with mine flails), and C Sqn with Valentines.43 RTR War Diary May 1943, The National Archives file WO 166/11096. More advanced vehicles arrived as time went on: Churchill Crocodile flamethrowers; Valentine Scorpion and Sherman Crab flail tanks; Canal Defence Lights; Snake Mine-clearing line charges etc. By the end of 1943, the joint RE/RAC assault training wing disappeared, and 43 RTR was organised as a 'breaching team', to demonstrate using all these specialised vehicles in tactical combination.43 RTR War Diary July‚ÄìDecember 1943, The National Archives file WO 166/11096. However, all this experimental and demonstration work meant that 43 RTR did not go to Normandy with the rest of 79 Armoured in June 1944. Instead, it was transferred to 35th Tank Brigade, a training brigade under GHQ Home Forces, providing reinforcements to 21st Army Group. 43 RTR was placed on a lower establishment and given the role of collective training for recruits and rehabilitation training for returning wounded.Joslen, pp. 185, 208.43 RTR War Diary August 1944, The National Archives file WO 166/14601. To India In January 1945, 43 RTR was told that it was to re-train in the Canal Defence Light (CDL) role for deployment to South East Asia Command.43 RTR War Diary January 1945, The National Archives file WO 166/16616. CDLs were tanks equipped with powerful searchlights and the crews were trained in night fighting. In the early part of 1945, the regiment was stationed at Lowther Castle, near Penrith, the CDL training centre. It sailed for India on 10 July, arriving at Bombay Docks on 1 August. However, news of the Japanese surrender arrived while the regiment was settling into camp at Bolarum, before its Grant CDL tanks had arrived from the docks.43 RTR War Diary July‚ÄìAugust 1945, The National Archives file WO 172/7341. As a result, 43 RTR never saw active service. Postwar After the end of World War II, 43 RTR remained a Territorial Army unit of the Royal Tank Regiment, based at Newcastle, until 1956 when it converted back to infantry under its old designation of 6th Bn Royal Northumberland Fusiliers.

He also serves as President of the Commonwealth Judicial Education Institute, and is former President of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), and former Chief Justice of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court. He was born in Basseterre, Saint Kitts and Nevis. Early life and career Byron won the Leeward Islands Scholarship in 1960 and went on to read law at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge. At Fitzwilliam, he won his oar as a member of the College‚Äôs top rowing team in the May Bumps for 1964. He graduated with an M.A and LL.B. in 1966. In 1965, he was called to the Bar of England and Wales by the Honourable Society of the Inner Temple. Sir Dennis distinguished himself in private practice as a Barrister-at-Law and Solicitor throughout the Leeward Islands, with Chambers in Saint Kitts, Nevis and Anguilla from 1966 to 1982. Judicial career His judicial career began in 1982 at the age of 38 when he was appointed as a High Court Judge of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, a federal Court serving six independent countries together with three Crown Colonies of Great Britain. He was soon frequently sitting as a Court of Appeal Judge in an acting capacity before being appointed a substantive member of the Court of Appeal in 1990. In 1986, as Acting Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Grenada, on secondment from the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, he presided over the famous murder trial involving the assassination of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop ‚Äì the longest criminal trial in Caribbean history. In 1995, over a five-month period, in tandem with Operation Uphold Democracy, Sir Dennis, with two other international Judges, and a full supporting team, organized judicial education programmes for the Haitian Judiciary. This was an initiative of the National Center for State Courts of the United States in the wake of the restoration of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in Haiti. In 1999, Judge Byron was appointed Chief Justice of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, having acted in that position for two years. As Chief Justice, he was the supreme judicial officer of the courts of Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, the British Virgin Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. As Acting Chief Justice, Judge Byron made the establishment of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court Judicial Reform Programme a matter of high priority. In 1997, he launched the Judicial Education Institute as a Committee of the Chief Justice‚Äôs Office. The Committee produced a Code of Ethics for Judges, and organized a series of seminars and training programmes providing orientation for Judges, lawyers and trial Court Registrars. This Programme was a prelude to the modernisation of practice and procedure in litigation, which was brought to fruition when Chief Justice Byron introduced the new Civil Procedure Rules 2000, which came into operation as of 31 December 2000. These new Rules, tailored to the norms of the Eastern Caribbean, are in keeping with the ethos of judicial case management which informs the Woolf Reforms instituted in England in 1998. Sir Dennis was the first Chief Justice to implement the English-modelled Civil Procedure Rules in the Caribbean region. With these reforms, Sir Dennis set a three-fold objective, namely, the enhancement of public access to the Court by simplifying procedures, the reduction of the delay of litigation from start to finish, and the inculcation of a higher standard of professionalism at the Bar. Judge Byron chaired the Rules Reform Committee, and hosted workshops for lawyers in different Caribbean islands, to which he invited a Judge, a Master and a leading practitioner from Canada to share their experiences and advice with regard to their own shift to case management by the Court. Sir Dennis has been President of the Commonwealth Judicial Education Institute in Halifax, Canada since the year 2000. In 2000, Judge Byron was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II and he was appointed a member of Her Majesty‚Äôs Most Honourable Privy Council in 2004, making him only the second national of St. Kitts and Nevis to be appointed, following the appointment of the country's first Prime Minister Dr. Kennedy Simmonds in 1984. Also in 2004, Sir Dennis was appointed as an Honorary Bencher of the Honourable Society of the Inner Temple. In March 2001, then Chief Justice Byron was a member of an international delegation of jurists who travelled to Zimbabwe on a Fact-Finding Mission on behalf of the Human Rights Institute of the International Bar Association, inquiring into reports of abuses against the Rule of Law by the Robert Mugabe Government. The 7-member Mission was headed by Lord Goldsmith, QC, who was soon to become Attorney General of England and Wales. The IBA is the world‚Äôs leading organization of Bar Associations, Law Societies and legal practitioners, drawn from 183 countries and representing 2.5 million lawyers. At the invitation of then-Secretary General of the United Nations Kofi Annan, Judge Byron, while serving as Chief Justice of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, from which position he retired, became a permanent Judge of the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in 2004. The ICTR was established by the United Nations Security Council to try war crimes committed during the Rwandan genocide of nearly 1 million people in 1994. Sir Dennis was elected President of the Tribunal in May 2007 and re-elected for a second term in May 2009. There are 23 other Judges over whom Sir Dennis presides as President of the ICTR. They are, in order of precedence, from Pakistan, Jamaica, United Republic of Tanzania, Turkey, Italy, China, Senegal, United States of America, Malta, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, Russia, Uganda, Kenya, Cameroon, Ghana, Jordan, Republic of Korea, Burkina Faso, Denmark, Madagascar, Turkey and Czech Republic. Sir Dennis was elected and re-elected President by his fellow Judges, in testimony to their confidence in his competence to lead the Tribunal. As President of the ICTR which is located in Arusha, Tanzania, Sir Dennis is also an Under-Secretary General of the United Nations. He is responsible for the overall management of that International Tribunal and for liaising with Member States as well as the Security Council. He oversees the implementation of ICTR strategic policies and the management of its external relations. He provides the dedicated leadership and commitment for the realization of the Tribunal‚Äôs overall Completion Strategy without sacrificing any of the vital safeguards of due process and fair trial rights. At the same time, he continues to maintain the excellent level of cooperation with stakeholders that is indispensable to buttress the work of the Tribunal in the development of international criminal justice. He has regularly addressed the Security Council of the United Nations in New York City to deliver six-monthly Reports on behalf of the Tribunal in his capacity as President on the progress of the Security Council‚Äôs Completion Strategy. President Byron has sat on seven trial benches and served on a number of pre-trial benches while at the Tribunal. He currently presides over the multi-accused Karemera, et al. trial, also known as Government I, involving √âdouard Karemera, former Minister of the Interior of Rwanda, and Matthieu Ngirumpatse, former President of the MRND. Sir Dennis has written many publications and has been a keynote speaker and guest lecturer at renowned events and conferences across several continents. On 16 March 2011, he delivered the 9th Annual Ruth Steinkraus-Cohen International Law Lecture of the United Nations Association of London hosted by the School of Oriental and African Studies of the University of London. He also holds the first Yogis & Keddy Chair in Human Rights Law at Dalhousie University. In 2010, Sir Dennis was made an Honorary Fellow by his Alma Mater, Fitzwilliam College of Cambridge University. In a recent interview with Radio Netherlands Worldwide, Sir Dennis highlighted two judgments of the ICTR as trend-setting in international law. Akayesu, which was the first case at the international level to interpret genocide in the light of the Genocide Convention and is also recognized as the seminal authority in International Criminal Law on sexual violence in conflict situations. As a result of this precedent, rape is now a crime of genocide. Secondly, President Byron highlighted the Media case which has identified the principles governing media responsibility in International Criminal Law. In mid-March 2011, it was announced that Sir Dennis was appointed as the new President of the Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ) during the recent Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Heads of Government Inter-Sessional Summit in Grenada. This appointment followed the unanimous recommendation of Sir Dennis for President by the Regional and Judicial Legal Services Commission. Sir Dennis ended his tenure of four years as President of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in May 2011 and was sworn in as President of the CCJ in his home country of Saint Kitts and Nevis on 1 September 2011; he demitted office on 4 July 2018. Personal life Sir Dennis is married to Lady Norma Byron, and is the father of four children. Sir Dennis is the son of the late Mr. Vincent Byron, Sr., M.B.E., former senior civil servant who served as warden of Anguilla and who on occasion acted as Governor-General's deputy to former Governor-General Sir Clement Arrindell, Q.C., Sir Dennis's uncle-in-law. Mr. Vincent Byron, Sr., and his wife, distinguished business proprietor Mrs. Pearl Byron, both died in mid-1998. His only sister, Helen Marcella Byron-Baker, was a former senior property manager at Durst Fetner, one of the largest property developers in New York. Sir Dennis previously practised law with his uncle, the late former Magistrate Cecil Byron. He is the older brother of former St. Kitts and Nevis Ambassador to the Republic of China on Taiwan and South Korea, Terence Byron, C.M.G., and of current Government Senator and Attorney General in the Federal Parliament, the Honourable Vincent Byron, Jr., who are Partners in the local law firm of Byron & Byron.

Motor Machine Gun Battalion At the end of May 1940, with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) being evacuated from Dunkirk and the imminent threat of German invasion of England, the 25th Army Tank Brigade was redesignated 2nd Motor Machine Gun Brigade and its regiments reorganised accordingly. Each of 51 RTR's three MMG squadrons consisted of three troops, each with six Humber Snipe or Hillman Utility ('Tilly') two-seat cars, two carrying Vickers medium machine guns, two Bren light machine guns and two Boys anti-tank rifles.Joslen, pp. 203, 211.51st RTR War Diary July‚ÄìAugust 1940, The National Archives, file WO 166/1424.

In January 1943, the regiment embarked, with the rest of the 25th Tank Brigade, for North Africa, where it came under the command of V Corps of the British First Army in the Tunisian Campaign. Tunisia A Universal Carrier and a Churchill tank of 51st Royal Tank Regiment during 6th Armoured Division's attack on the town of Pichon, Tunisia, 8 April 1943. The regiment took part in containing the German offensive of Operation Ochsenkopf in February - March 1943. At a place called Steamroller farm, two Churchill tanks ambushed and shot up an entire German transport column before rejoining the rest of their squadron. The end result was the destruction of two 88 mm, two 75 mm, two 50 mm and four smaller calibre anti-tank guns, twenty-five wheeled vehicles, two 3 inch Mortars, two Mark III tanks and nearly 200 Axis casualties. On 7‚Äì8 April, 51 RTR supported IX Corps at Fondouk Pass. The 128th (Hampshire) Brigade of 46th Infantry Division crossed the Wadi Marguellil during the night and at 5.30 am on 8 April began its main attack, supported by 'C' Sqn 51 RTR, and by noon was on its objective.Playfair & Molony, pp 379‚Äì81. The regiment ended the campaign in Army reserve.Playfair & Molony, p 446. The 25th Tank Brigade came under the command of Brigadier James Noel Tetley of the Leeds Rifles at the end of the Tunisia campaign. He was the only Territorial Army officer of the Royal Tank Regiment to command a brigade on active service. The brigade, including 51 RTR, remained training in North Africa for almost a year, before they were required for service on the Italian Front. The regiment celebrated Cambrai Day (20 November, commemorating the tank Battle of Cambrai) in Algeria.51 RTR War Diary November 1943, The National Archives, file WO 169/9380. 51 RTR embarked on 16 April 1944 and landed at Naples, where it was equipped with Churchill tanks, with a few Shermans and Stuarts.51 RTR War Diary April 1944, The National Archives, file WO 170/865. Italy The brigade distinguished itself in support of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division in the assault on the Hitler Line in May 1944. At the request of the Canadians, its regiments adopted the Maple leaf as an additional badge, later worn by 51 RTR's successors, the Leeds Detachment (Leeds Rifles), Imphal (PWO) Company, East and West Riding Regiment.25 Tank Brigade War Diary May 1944, The National Archives, file WO 170/591. Brigadier Tetley, formerly of the Leeds Rifles himself, was the only TA RTR officer to command a brigade on active service. 51 RTR went on to fight in the Gothic Line battles of August‚ÄìSeptember 1944. Churchill tank crews of HQ Troop, 51 RTR share out rations near their camouflaged vehicles before going into action in support of the 1st Canadian Division, Italy, 17 May 1944. To deal with the successive enemy lines of defences anticipated in the later stages of the campaign, it was decided in late 1944 to convert the brigade into the 25th Assault Engineer Brigade, equipped with the specialized tanks known as Hobart's Funnies. Organised on 5 January 1945, this was primarily a Royal Engineers formation, but 51 RTR remained in the brigade, although converted to specialised armour.Joslen, p. 175.

The flamethrowing tanks crept forward during the preliminary bombardment and positioned themselves close to the floodbank as possible. One minute before the infantry assault started, the positions were flamed. Most of the Crocodiles had to be 60 feet behind the bank to be able to direct their flame over the bank.Jackson, pp. 219, 224. World War II in Europe ended shortly after this operation. Postwar When the Territorial Army was reformed after the war, it included a combined 45th/51st (Leeds Rifles) RTR. The personnel received their tank training from 'A' Sqn of 6 RTR at RAF Worksop.http://rafworksop.btck.co.uk/BaseHistory/1945-1951 Brigadier Noel Tetley was the honorary colonel. In 1956, the 45th/51st (Leeds Rifles) RTR returned to the infantry role under its old title of 7th (Leeds Rifles) Bn West Yorkshire Regiment. It carried the honorary distinction on its colours and appointments of the badge of the Royal Tank Regiment with the dates '1942-45' and two scrolls inscribed 'North Africa' and 'Italy'.

Origin and training As part of the rearmament of the British Army before World War II, the 6th Battalion Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, a Territorial Army infantry battalion, was converted to the armoured role on 1 November 1938, under the designation 43rd (6th City) Battalion, The Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, Royal Tank Regiment, or '43 RTR' for short. During 1939, it formed 49 RTR as a duplicate regiment. The regiments shared St George's Drill Hall in Newcastle upon Tyne as their depot.43 RTR War Diary August 1940, The National Archives, Kew, file WO 166/1414. While 43 RTR used the conventional 'A', 'B' and 'C' squadron designations, 49 RTR adopted 'X', 'Y' and 'Z' for its squadrons.Scull. Both regiments were part of 25th Army Tank Brigade.Joslen, p. 203. In August 1939, 49 RTR had still not received any tanks, so it mobilised as an infantry unit, and spent the Phoney War on guard duty in North East England. In April 1940, it finally received a few old tanks for instruction (one Vickers Medium per squadron, and one Matilda for the regimental headquarters) plus some old cars. In May, the regiment moved to Catterick Camp to begin armoured training.

Now 49 RTR returned its 'Tillies' to store and began intensive infantry tank training on the South Downs with new Matilda II tanks. It finally adopted the usual 'A', 'B' and 'C' designations for its squadrons. Later in 1941, the regiment came once more under 25th Army Tank Brigade, which had reconverted from the motor machine gun role and moved to the South Coast. Specialised armour In January 1942, 49 RTR moved to Lowther Castle, near Penrith, to train in a new role as a night fighting tank battalion equipped with Canal Defence Lights (CDLs). These carried a powerful searchlight fitted to a Matilda tank, replacing the turret and main armament. In July 1943, the Matilda CDLs were replaced by Grant tank CDLs, which retained the 75 mm main gun in a sponson. During this period, 49 RTR joined 35th Army Tank Brigade, which later formed part of 79th Armoured Division, which concentrated all the specialised armour units training for the Invasion of Normandy. 49 RTR landed in France on 12 August 1944 as part of 1st Tank Brigade in 79th Armoured, but there was no call for CDLs in the Normandy campaign. The regiment was issued with conventional Sherman gun tanks in addition to their Grant CDLs, and during October, 49 RTR supplied Sherman crews to other regiments that required reinforcements; 3 complete troops Nottinghamshire (Sherwood Rangers) Yeomanry War Diary October 1944, The National Archives, Kew, file WO 171/861 (about 40 men and 2 officers) to the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry on 7 October; 10 crews to the Royal Scots Greys and 12 drivers to the 3rd/4th County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters) on 17 October). Next, the Grant CDLs were returned to the training unit at Lowther. The whole of 1st Tank Brigade was being broken up to provide drafts to other regiments, and it appeared that 49 RTR was to share that fate. However, reduced to two squadrons ('A' and 'C'), the regiment was redesignated \\"49th Armoured Personnel Carrier Regiment\\" (49 APCR) and re- equipped with Ram Kangaroos (obsolete Canadian-built Ram tanks, similar to Shermans, with their turrets removed to transport an infantry section). Each squadron could carry one battalion. First Canadian Army already had an APC regiment (1st Canadian Armoured Carrier Regiment), and 49 APCR would perform the same role for Second British Army.Ellis, p. 384. Operational career Infantry of the 53rd (Welsh) Division in a Ram Kangaroo on the outskirts of Ochtrup, Germany, 3 April 1945 49 RTR finally went into action on the night of 13/14 November 1944, ferrying forward troops of 51st (Highland) Infantry Division. The value of the new vehicles was soon appreciated. Lieutenant- General Brian Horrocks, commanding XXX Corps, later wrote that Kangaroos 'proved a great boon in the closing stages of the war... I once saw a whole brigade of the 51st Highland Division in these vehicles being heavily shelled by the Germans. I thought their casualties were bound to be high, but they had only two men wounded'.Horrocks, p. 250. On 3 December, 49 APCR took part in Operation Guildford, the assault on Blerick, a heavily defended suburb of the Dutch town of Venlo. The Kangaroos advanced behind a creeping barrage along lanes cut through the minefields and anti-tank ditch by flail tanks and bridgelaying tanks. They delivered the attacking infantry (8th Battalion Royal Scots and 6th Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers) close to their objectives and, although some Kangaroos were disabled by mines, the squadrons returned for two more battalions. In the words of the Official History, 'from that point the taking of the town proved to be a walk-over'.Ellis, p. 160. Ram Kangaroo at the Bovington Tank Museum During February 1945 49 APCR was kept busy during Operation Veritable, the advance on Kleve, and made newspaper headlines by the manner in which they forced their way into Goch.Ellis, p. 267. For the assault crossing of the Rhine, Operation Plunder, 49 APCR formed 'B' Independent Squadron. This was equipped with Grant CDLs, brought back from Lowther. The operation was carried out under 'artificial moonlight' (searchlights shining onto the cloud cover) and during the assault on Rees by the 51st (Highland) Division the Grants both illuminated the crossing and engaged the enemy on the far bank with their 75mm guns. Meanwhile, A and C Sqns ferried Highlanders forward to the crossing points.Saunders, p. 58. Once over the Rhine and until the end of the campaign, Kangaroos were used extensively to move infantry forward rapidly over territory recaptured from the enemy. 49 APCR formed 'F' Squadron to increase the number of vehicles available. As a hostilities-only unit, 49 RTR was quickly disbanded after the end of World War II, a process that was complete by 13 December 1945. NotesReferences * Major L. F.

The modern estate was constructed from the 1990s onwards. Overview Lindsayfield is situated next to the districts of Greenhills and Whitehills. The main road around the outside of Lindsayfield extends offering a drive to the villages of Auldhouse, Strathaven, Chapelton and Leaburn. The main road through the area currently just ends at a dead end. However, in the near future, the road will be continued through to Jackton, to allow for a large new part of the town to be built in the Jackton Community Growth Area. The new estate will, like Lindsayfield, use the Jackton Road as the boundary, but will also use the Hayhill Road. Lindsayfield was constructed by a number of major house builders, including George Wimpey, Barratt, Lynch, Bellway, Stewart Milne, Cala, Dawn Homes and Persimmon Homes. Lindsayfield is accessed from the eponymous Road which divides four distinct estates on the northern side from the huge interconnecting southern residential scheme, extending from the Morrisons supermarket to the original western edge of the estate. Like much of East Kilbride, Lindsayfield is characterised by landscaped open space dividing one phase of house-building from the next, and one builder's contribution from its rivals. There are a small number of bungalows, and a smattering of apartments throughout the district, but the vast majority of properties here are three, four and five-bedroom detached houses, making the district very popular with families. Since it is on the southern fringe of East Kilbride and is a closed suburb with no through-traffic, Lindsayfield has very little crime or antisocial behaviour and no graffiti. Local schools Castlefield Primary School, St. Vincent's Primary School and Crosshouse Primary School are where local children normally go to school, but there are plans to build a new school northwest of Lindsayfield in a new area. Although much of Lindsayfield is aesthetically modern as it is 'new build', the telephony system currently in place is not modern. Most of Lindsayfield has telephony delivered by BT over a passive optical network (TPON). This means most of Lindsayfield can only previously get slow-speed Broadband, of around 1MB connection speed, however, FTTC has now been extended and currently reaches to Cabinet 73, with ongoing work providing additional capacity for the last remaining areas. A partial copper overlay programme was carried out in 2003 to allow some residents of Lindsayfield to receive a copper pair telephone line and thus an ADSL service.

It is a group of businesses that manufactures and distributes fire detection and suppression equipment, as well as smoke and CO alarm units. Kidde is one of America's largest manufacturer of smoke alarms and fire safety products. Kidde Fire Safety North America is headquartered in Mebane, NC. History Kidde fire extinguisher The company was founded by Walter Kidde in 1917 in the United States. The founder was of Czech ancestry, and unrelated to the Danish author Harald Kidde.  1900s  Walter Kidde founded Kidde Inc. in 1917 with $300 he had in savings. In 1918 the company, then known as Walter Kidde & Company, purchased the rights to the \\"Rich\\" system; a way to detect fires on board ships.  1920s  In 1923, Kidde purchased the patent rights for a siphon device that allowed quick release of carbon dioxide, improving the function of fire extinguishers. In 1924, the company produced the first portable carbon dioxide fire extinguisher and in 1925 it installed the first built in industrial fire extinguishing system. In 1926, Walter Kidde & Company partnered with the Navy to design a system to protect airplane engines against fires.  1930s  The company established a British operation at Northolt in 1935 as its first overseas operation. The company further expanded to Africa, Asia, Europe and South America.  1940s  When Walter Kidde died in 1943, his son John took control of the company. At that time, the company employed over 5,000 people, and was producing over $60 million of war supplies.  1950s  At the end of WWII the company saw a significant drop in sales. In the 1950s, the company diversified into machinery and tool manufacturing, siphon devices for consumer and medical uses, and aircraft accessories.  1960s‚Äì1970s  Robert L. Dickinson was named president of the company in 1961. In January 1964, Fred Sullivan, officer and director of the Litton Industries, succeeded Dickinson as president and later succeeded John Kidde as chairman. From 1964 to 1968, Kidde grew from $40 million in annual revenues to $400 million. In 1966, Kidde was named to the Fortune 500 list at position 283. In 1968 the company was incorporated as Kidde & Company, Inc.  1980s  In May 1987, John Kidde died.New York Times,\\"J.F. Kidde,Ex- Head of Diversified Concern\\" In August 1987, Kidde was purchased for $1.7 billion by August Hanson Industries, the United States arm of Hanson Trust of the United Kingdom. In August 1988, Hanson sold most of the Kidde fire protection business to Pilgrim House Group, a firm based in the United Kingdom involved in electrical products and fire protection. Included in the sale were Walter Kidde North America Group, Fenwal Inc., and Kidde's Fire Protection Group Europe. During the Kidde acquisition process Pilgrim House was purchased by Williams Holdings plc, an industrial management firm. In 1989, it merged with Graviner (another Williams Holdings business) to form Kidde Graviner.  1990s  In 1990, subsidiary Walter Kidde Aerospace Inc. opened a Production and Technology Center, for $4 million. By that time, Kidde products were found in aircraft such as the B-2 Stealth Bomber and 747-700 airliners. In 1993, it acquired Dunford Hepburn. In February 1997, Williams Holdings purchased Chubb Security plc.  2000s  In March 2000, Williams announced the breakup of the company. Now an independent entity, the firm adopted the name Kidde plc in September 2000. In October 2000, Kidde announced it was going to demerge from Chubb plc. Kidde plc listed on the London Stock Exchange in November of that year. In December 2004, Financial Times reported Kidde as \\"the market leader in residential fire protection in the United States.\\" In April 2005, United Technologies Corporation finalized its acquisition of Kidde and place the company under its new Fire & Security brand. The move re joined it to its former sister company Chubb Security, and several other brands to create UTC Fire & Security.\\"UTC agrees to buy Kidde for $2.8bn\\". The Washington Post, 16 December 2004.  2010s  In April 2013, Kidde expanded its Worry-Free product line to include UL-listed carbon monoxide (CO) alarms. In November 2017, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a recall notice for 134 models of Kidde fire extinguishers citing failures to discharge correctly when used. As many as 37.8 million extinguishers could be covered by the recall notice. Not too long later in March 2018, Kidde recalled their 2 Dual- Sensor Smoke Detector models, PI9010 and the PI2010.https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2018/kidde-recalls-dual-sensor-smoke- alarms-due-to-risk-of-failure-to-alert-consumers- to-a#:~:text=This%20recall%20involves%20models%20PI2010,center%20of%20the%20smoke%20alarm.&text;=They%20should%20remove%20and%20discard,and%20install%20the%20replacement%20alarm. The reason for the recall was a yellow cap left on one of the sensors that could fail to alert buyers of the alarm of a possible fire. 452,000 units in the USA and about 40,000 units in Canada were affected in the recall. The recall affected units of the 2 models manufactured from September 2016, through January of 2018. No injuries or accidents were reported because of the yellow cap before the recall.  Locations  Kidde is headquartered in Mebane, North Carolina. Kidde Canada (formerly Pyrene Company or Chubb Security) operates under Kidde Fire Safety North America and is located in Toronto, Ontario. The Kidde Fenwal Controls division is located in Ashland, Massachusetts. Kidde Aerospace is located in Wilson, North Carolina.  Awards and recognition  In September 2017, Kidde was ranked among the top manufacturers of carbon monoxide alarms. Kidde's fire blanket was also ranked a \\"top player\\" in the industry by the Global Fire Blanket Market. Kidde carbon monoxide alarms are included in the \\"Carbon Monoxide Alarms industry\\" report of 2017 to 2022.

(Click here for rotating model) In geometry, an inscribed planar shape or solid is one that is enclosed by and \\"fits snugly\\" inside another geometric shape or solid. To say that \\"figure F is inscribed in figure G\\" means precisely the same thing as \\"figure G is circumscribed about figure F\\". A circle or ellipse inscribed in a convex polygon (or a sphere or ellipsoid inscribed in a convex polyhedron) is tangent to every side or face of the outer figure (but see Inscribed sphere for semantic variants). A polygon inscribed in a circle, ellipse, or polygon (or a polyhedron inscribed in a sphere, ellipsoid, or polyhedron) has each vertex on the outer figure; if the outer figure is a polygon or polyhedron, there must be a vertex of the inscribed polygon or polyhedron on each side of the outer figure. An inscribed figure is not necessarily unique in orientation; this can easily be seen, for example, when the given outer figure is a circle, in which case a rotation of an inscribed figure gives another inscribed figure that is congruent to the original one. Familiar examples of inscribed figures include circles inscribed in triangles or regular polygons, and triangles or regular polygons inscribed in circles. A circle inscribed in any polygon is called its incircle, in which case the polygon is said to be a tangential polygon. A polygon inscribed in a circle is said to be a cyclic polygon, and the circle is said to be its circumscribed circle or circumcircle. The inradius or filling radius of a given outer figure is the radius of the inscribed circle or sphere, if it exists. The definition given above assumes that the objects concerned are embedded in two- or three-dimensional Euclidean space, but can easily be generalized to higher dimensions and other metric spaces. For an alternative usage of the term \\"inscribed\\", see the inscribed square problem, in which a square is considered to be inscribed in another figure (even a non-convex one) if all four of its vertices are on that figure. Properties *Every circle has an inscribed triangle with any three given angle measures (summing of course to 180¬∞), and every triangle can be inscribed in some circle (which is called its circumscribed circle or circumcircle). *Every triangle has an inscribed circle, called the incircle. *Every circle has an inscribed regular polygon of n sides, for any n‚â•3, and every regular polygon can be inscribed in some circle (called its circumcircle). *Every regular polygon has an inscribed circle (called its incircle), and every circle can be inscribed in some regular polygon of n sides, for any n‚â•3. *Not every polygon with more than three sides has an inscribed circle; those polygons that do are called tangential polygons. Not every polygon with more than three sides is an inscribed polygon of a circle; those polygons that are so inscribed are called cyclic polygons. *Every triangle can be inscribed in an ellipse, called its Steiner circumellipse or simply its Steiner ellipse, whose center is the triangle's centroid. *Every non-equilateral triangle has an infinitude of inscribed ellipses. One of them is a circle, and one of them is the Steiner inellipse which is tangent to the triangle at the midpoints of the sides. *Every acute triangle has three inscribed squares. In a right triangle two of them are merged and coincide with each other, so there are only two distinct inscribed squares. An obtuse triangle has a single inscribed square, with one side coinciding with part of the triangle's longest side. *A Reuleaux triangle, or more generally any curve of constant width, can be inscribed with any orientation inside a square of the appropriate size.

It was built around 1618 by Andrew Stewart (1590-1639), who was later, in 1628, created a baronet and who, later still, succeeded as The 2nd Baron Castle Stuart, in 1629. He was the eldest son of The 1st Baron Castle Stuart (formerly The 3rd Lord Ochiltree; 1560-1629). Both the 1st and 2nd Barons Castle Stuart had come from Scotland during the Plantation of Ulster and established the nearby town of Stewartstown. Andrew Stewart (later 2nd Baron Castle Stuart) acquired the land of Ballokevan from Robert Stewart between 1610 and 1619 and built his castle overlooking Roughan Lough. It is a small square castle, three storeys high with a central tower square, flanked by thick rounded towers at each corner. The castle was once the refuge of Sir F√©ilim √ì N√©ill, leader of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 in Ulster. He was captured there in 1653 and taken to Dublin, where he was hanged for treason. Colonel Robert Stewart, of Irry, inherited the castle from his brothers and died here in 1662.

History The band was formed in Akron, Ohio, in late 1981 by Tom Seiler of local punk group The Bursting Brains, Mick Hurray of the neo-surf group The Nelsons, and Jim Friend of V-Nervz. The band went through a few bass players before placing an ad in the Cleveland free paper Scene. Brad Warner, who had been in a new wave group called Mmaxx, answered the ad and after an afternoon audition he was accepted into the band. Warner remained a member of the group until its dissolution. The band dissolved in the spring of 1983. In December 2005, Jim Lanza hatched the idea of reviving a handful of old Cleveland-area punk bands for a one time show entitled Cleveland's Screaming. Warner decided to take the opportunity to create a documentary about the punk rock scene in Akron and Cleveland in the 1980s also entitled Cleveland's Screaming. The documentary was released in 2007. Since they reformed, the band has begun writing and recording new music. In early 2013, the band signed to the record label Revolution Harmony.

Together with the Child and Adolescent Community Health Division, it made up the Child and Adolescent Health Service. The PMH site is located on Roberts Road in Subiaco, Western Australia. PMH originated as the Perth Children's Hospital in 1909 after 12 years of community fundraising. The original facilities included 40 beds, an operating theatre and outpatient department. The current name, Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, was adopted in 1949, in honour of Princess Margaret, sister of Queen Elizabeth II. In 1994 the organisational structure for the Princess Margaret Hospital for Children and King Edward Memorial Hospital's merged (but not their locations). In 2002 that organisation was renamed Women's and Children's Health Service. In 2006, the two hospitals were once again separated.

The game's main character pilots a prototype transformable fighter-mecha left from her grandfather to fight against an alien attack on humankind. The game is mostly a horizontal shooter, with one down scrolling stage. Gameplay Like many scrolling shooters, the player initially has a basic shot, which can be upgraded and/or exchanged for different weapons, as well as gain smaller ships that follow the player's ship around and copy its attacks. As is usual, these power-ups are distributed throughout the levels. They are retained when advancing to the next stage but lost entirely when the player loses a life. Two additional mechanics differentiate Arrow Flash from similar scrolling shooters, one of which is that the ability to transform the player's ship. The two forms available are a humanoid mech form and a fighter jet form. The player's weapons change depending on the form. The jet form only shoots forward but intensely, it can fly faster horizontally and the helper ships follow the jet in a snakelike pattern. The mech form has a wider shooting angle, sometimes even firing backwards upon getting enough upgrades. It has a faster vertical speed and the helper ships remain in a fixed formation whilst in this form. Missiles will also home on enemies in mech form, whereas they only travel directly forward in jet form. Regardless of form, the ship is killed in only one hit unless the player picks up an energy shield which can sustain three hits. The game's titular \\"Arrow Flash\\" is a highly powerful attack for each form; the jet fires five large blasts forward, while the mech form becomes engulfed in flame, rendering it immune to attack for a short while. In the default \\"Stock\\" mode, arrow flashes are instant but limited and must be used sparingly. The other mode \\"Charge\\" allows arrow flashes to be used infinitely but with a weaker effect and must be 'charged up' before use. Plot Arrow Flash follows the protagonist Zana Keene (named Anna Schwinn in the European release, and Starna Oval in the Japanese release) as she fights against hostile aliens. The game contains references to Gundam and Macross. Reception Arrow Flash received mixed reviews, including 32/50 from ASM, 3/10 from G√©n√©ration 4, 24% from Mega,Mega issue 9, page 23.

It was built by local agricultural interests to develop unproductive land. It had been intended to continue to Knott End but ran out of money. It eventually opened in 1870. In 1898 the Knott End Railway was authorised to continue to Knott End; it opened in 1908. The two companies were associated and the KER acquired the earlier company. The KER was still desperately short of money, and local people who were owed money bought rolling stock to keep the company going. The Knott End branch line in LMS daysSalt extraction near Preesall became a dominant industry from 1890, and the railway conveyed some remarkable tonnages of salt (outward) and coal (inward, for power). The passenger service was discontinued in 1930 and the line closed completely in 1965. Authorisation The site where the line met the LNWR main line. The branch line passed through a cutting, now filled with trees, on the left, joining the main line immediately left of the visible bridge. The branch line continued on its own separate single track, parallel to the main line, to Garstang and Catterall railway station, south of this location.In the mid-nineteenth century, the tract of land to the west of Garstang, in the Fylde area of Lancashire, was an unworked expanse of moss. Attempts were made over time to reclaim the land and put it to agricultural use. In 1863, local landowners led by Wilson F France, the Squire of Rawcliffe, promoted a branch line railway. They saw that transport links to market for agricultural produce were essential; their line was to connect Knott End, opposite Fleetwood on the estuary of the River Wyre, by way of Pilling, to Garstang station on the London and North Western RailwayThe line belonged to the Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway and was worked by the LNWR. main line between Preston and Lancaster.McLoughlin In December 1863, a prospectus was produced for the proposed Garstang and Knot-End Railway. Six directors were named: John Russell, Julian Augustus Tarner, Henry Gardner, Colonel James Bourne, Richard Bennett and James Overend. The prospectus explained that the object was to improve the outlets for agricultural produce by giving easy access to the markets at Preston and in the towns and cities of industrial Lancashire. The line, it claimed, would link up with Yorkshire, Humberside and Newcastle upon Tyne, and could become part of a main artery between the east and west coasts. A harbour might be built at Knott End to rival and even outgrow Fleetwood. Their scheme went to Parliament, where it was opposed by the London and North Western Railway and the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. Facing that danger, the promoters now asserted that their line was \\"a simple and unpretending line, proposed entirely for the accommodation of the local traffic of the district\\".Walmsley Accordingly, the Garstang and Knot End Railway was authorised by Act of 30 June 1864. Authorised capital was ¬£60,000; the line would be .WellsWalmesleySuggitt, p.28Grant, pages 238 and 239 Construction and opening Immediately the company was in financial difficulty; the Parliamentary Act authorised ¬£60,000 in share capital, but the company was unable to raise the subscriptions required. In December 1867, the only work accomplished had been the making of the formation for the first half mile, and it was decided to abandon plans to build beyond Pilling. Parliamentary approval for an extension of the time allowed for construction was obtained in 1867, and again in 1869, on the latter occasion also allowing a further ¬£40,000 in authorised share capital.Sekon Progress was slow, but in 1870 it appeared possible to open the line as far as Pilling. An LNWR engine was hired in to test the track. The company could not afford to purchase a locomotive, and train services were operated using a hired 0-4-2 saddle tank named Hebe. Four passenger coaches were procured by a group of debenture holders, who formed the Garstang Rolling Stock Company on 12 October 1870 for the purpose.Perkins The permanent way consisted of 48 lb rails fastened to longitudinal sleepers, although a portion was laid with 56 lb bridge rails. At last on 5 December 1870 the line was opened from Garstang & Catterall Junction (the main line station) to Pilling; there were intermediate stations at Garstang Town and Nateby. There was a celebratory dinner at the Royal Oak Hotel, Garstang, on 14 December 1870. The construction had cost ¬£150,000.Suggitt, pp.28-30 Operation Farmer's Friend (or \\"Pilling Pig\\"), an 1875 Hudswell Clarke 0-6-0ST and the third locomotive on the lineThe train service consisted of nine trains each way between Garstang Junction and Garstang Town, with two (three on market days) proceeding to and from Pilling. After 1875 this was altered to three each way throughout. In the early years, the trains would pick up and set down passengers anywhere on the route; moreover wagons would be left at a convenient place on the line for unloading, detached from the outward train. They would then be \\"collected\\" on the train's return journey, and propelled back to Garstang. \\"It was not uncommon to see a many as five wagons placed at the front of the train in this way.\\" Trains were mixed (passengers and goods); passengers could board at any point along the line by request. There was no reserve rolling stock, and when Hebe needed repairs in March 1872, the line was closed for two days. The company fell behind with the rental payments for Hebe, and the locomotive was seized by the owners. It was possible to run occasional goods trains afterwards using horse traction, but the passenger service was suspended on 11 March 1872, and goods trains ceased running two weeks later.Suggitt, pp.28-30 A fresh locomotive, an 0-4-0T named Union, was purchased by the debenture holdersDebenture holders were persons or institutions which had lent money to the company as opposed to taking shares; no doubt seeing that bankrupting the company would lose them all their investment, they thought the purchase of Union would enable the company to generate some profit and get their money back. in 1875 and a goods service was resumed on 23 February 1875; passenger services followed on 17 May 1875. A replacement engine, Farmer's Friend, was acquired in December of that year. It became known locally as the Pilling Pig on account of the squeal made by its whistle. Subsequently, this name was given to all engines and was often used to refer to the railway itself. The company later acquired another engine, an 0-6-0 saddle tank name Farmer's Friend, which started work the following year.Suggitt, pp.30-32 Receivership In 1878 the railway was placed in the hands of a receiver, as it was unable to meet its financial obligations. However it gradually made progress, and in 1890 it began to pay interest to debenture holders: by 1894 it had paid off its debts.Marshall Knott End Railway In 1894 the company harboured thoughts of continuing to Knott End once again. Eventually, on 12 August 1898, Parliamentary authority was obtained for the Knott End Railway' (KER) to extend the line from Pilling to Knott End. The KER had just as much difficulty in raising capital as its predecessor, and it took ten years to build miles of line. Continuation of two separate companies was hardly practical, and as completion of the line to Knott End was near, on 1 July 1908 the Knott End Railway Company bought the original Garstang and Knot End Company, and the line opened throughout to passengers on 29 July 1908. The acquisition of the Garstang company had cost ¬£44,690. The new line cost ¬£19,065, and the transfer of the new locomotive, eight passenger carriages, six wagons and three brake vans, cost ¬£110,000. With miscellaneous charges the complete line of 11 miles and 29 chains had cost ¬£179,991. In 1913, 91,918 passengers were carried. In 1920 a steam railmotor was hired in from the London and North Western Railway; it operated the passenger service until that was withdrawn.Gemmell Personal view in 1908 T R Perkins visited the line in 1908, before the extension to Knot End was open. He observed that there was \\"a considerable haulage of goods and coal, together with that of military requirements for an artillery camp in the neighbourhood of Knot-End. Several guns for the camp, which had just arrived by train, were standing in the station yard at Pilling at the time of our visit.\\" Perkins was told that receipts for the preceding half year were ¬£2,117 and expenditure ¬£1,208. The rolling stock, he found, consisted of two locomotives, six passenger carriages, and 41 goods vehicles. Two of the carriages had recently been purchased from the Mersey Railway and were not yet in service. The other four carriages had been in use on the line since the beginning. They were reported to be the first examples in Great Britain of the \\"corridor coach\\" (referred to nowadays as open saloon coaches). They were six wheelers, with the body carried very low, and entry was from end platforms, the seats being arranged either side of a central gangway. The automatic brake was not used. Perkins explained the acquisition of the locomotive \\"Farmer's Friend\\": > This engine was obtained by an association of residents near the railway, to > whom the closing of the line had been a great inconvenience; having formed > themselves into a limited liability company, \\"The Garstang Engine Company\\", > they ordered the engine from Messrs Hudswell, Clark & Co. of Leeds, and > leased it to the railway for 14 years at 10 per cent. on cost price. Before > the lease expired, however, the railway purchased the locomotive from the > lessors, and it continued to work upon the line until 1900, when it was sold > and replaced by a new engine, \\"New Century\\"... In 1883 the \\"Hope\\" was > purchased by the same company and leased to the [railway] company on similar > terms, but does not appear to have been taken over, as we find that, on the > expiration of the lease, a new engine, the \\"Jubilee Queen\\" was purchased by > the railway... This locomotive was much more powerful than any previously > used on the line... The \\"New Century\\", purchased three years later, is > precisely similar, but cost considerably more. Traffic after completion of the extension The extension to Knott End enabled a new traffic, moss litter, to be carried. Moss litter was extensively used as bedding for animals. In 1909 the company carried 55 tons of the traffic, but by 1916 this reached 6,854 tons. After that date the volume declined steeply, largely due to road motor competition. In 1909 beer was carried: 356 tons were conveyed, but that traffic too quickly declined. A buoyant traffic that transformed the fortunes of the branch line was salt. The United Alkali Company built a large works near Preesall: in its early period, in 1909 55 tons of salt were carried by the railway. In April 1912 United Alkali opened a branch railway siding miles long from near Knott End. In 1913 there were 7,916 tons conveyed by rail. In 1920 the total was 53,416 tons. The United Alkali works required considerable volumes of coal, and 9,244 tons were brought in in the year 1911, rising to 24,135 tons in 1920. The Alkali works had a mineral railway system with a wharf on the river, and these tonnages may have had short transits by rail.The tonnages are quoted by respected authors, but need to be read cautiously, and may refer to rail use on the Fleetwood side of the River Wyre. The salt works was on the west side of the river, and any rail transit to ultimate destination would not have involved the Garstang line. After the discontinuation of the pipeline, the dry salt was probably taken over the Wyre from Preesall Wharf, without using the Garstang line. Inwards coal may well have come over the line, but equally well may have come in to Preesall Wharf by coaster. If these traffics used the Preesall works mineral line, it would be misleading to regard them as running on the Garstang and Knott End branch line. Preesall salt works Extensive salt deposits near Preesall were discovered in 1872, and in time this led to industrial extraction from 1885 by the Fleetwood Salt Company, which sold to the Salt Union Limited in 1888, which sold to United Alakali Ltd in 1890. The salt was extracted in the form of brine (a saturated solution of salt in water). Due to the absence of any transport facilities capable of handling the volume of salt, an area on the west side of the river, at Burn Naze, south of Fleetwood, was selected as the location of a purifying works, operational from 1889. The brine was transported to Burn Naze by a ten-inch steel pipe. From about 1891 the system of extraction was changed to dry mining. Technical difficulties resulted in the mine closing in 1930. Grouping of the railways Compulsory grouping of the railways took place in 1922 - 1923 under the Railways Act 1921. A new London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) was established and the Knott End Railway was absorbed into the LMS; it was its smallest constituent in the grouping process. Four steam engines as well as the railmotor were carried into LMS stock.Suggitt, p.32 The settlement gave holders of 4% debenture stock an equivalent LMS stock that would give 3%; this may have been a recognition of the uncertain and now-declining commercial position fo the Knott End company. Ordinary shares were cancelled, as were the arrears of interest on debenture stock. In the last full year before the grouping, 1922, the line carried 77,579 passenger journeys and 69,535 tons of goods. The total revenue was ¬£12,815 and the expenditure ¬£11,583. Some time after 1925 the Moss Litter Works near Cogie Hill crossing closed. Closure The line closed to passenger traffic on 31 March 1930.Ashworth (1930), p.433 The line continued to be used for goods for the time being, but the section from Knott End to Pilling was closed completely on 13 November 1950, followed by the Pilling to Garstang Town section, which closed on 31 July 1963, The short section to continued in use for two more years until closure came on 16 August 1965.Suggitt, p.34 of the route near Knott End is now a footpath. Several crossing keepers' cottages along the line still stand as private residences.

In 1962, their single \\"Remember Then\\" was a hit, and \\"Life Is But a Dream,\\" \\"Never\\" and \\"I Believe\\" also charted. As the oldies revival scene started a strong run in the early 1970s and 1980s, the Earls became one of the most requested groups in the doo-wop genre. They are still performing and remain on the oldies circuit. Other recordings included \\"Looking For My Baby\\" and \\"Kissing.\\" Albums included Remember Me Baby, The Earls: Today, The Earls - Live, Earl Change, and Streets of the Bronx. Biography The Earls are one of the New York City doo-wop success stories. Discovered singing on the street corner in front of subway station, the Earls took the original black doo-wop street corner harmony sound, and refined and expanded it for new audiences. The Earls were known for their \\"Baby Talk\\" styling of their background harmony riffs. Larry Chance was the driving force behind the group's formation and success. Chance grew up in Philadelphia and attended high school with Chubby Checker, Frankie Avalon, and Danny Rapp of Danny & the Juniors. But it was not until 1957 that he moved with his parents to the Bronx after high school, that his musical career took off. Chance formed a group at the Tecumsa Social Club, known as the Hi-Hatters. The group was Chance, Bob Del Din, Eddie Harder, Larry Palombo and John Wray. Later, in 1961, the Earls lost their original member Larry Palombo in an army skydiving accident when his parachute failed to open during an exercise. In 1961, Rome released the Earls' first record ‚Äì \\"Life is But a Dream\\" (Rome 101 ‚Äì 1961) b/w \\"It\`s You\\" (and in the late 1970s released with \\"Whoever You Are\\" as the B-side). The group then performed with Murray the K and on Dick Clark's American Bandstand show. They released another record that year, \\"Looking For My Baby\\" (Rome 102) b/w \\"Cross My Heart\\". In 1962, the group hooked up with Stan Vincent and recorded \\"Remember Then\\" for Old Town Records (Old Town 1130) b/w \\"Let's Waddle\\". It was a hit, peaking at #24 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1963. Chance co-wrote the group's next single \\"Never\\" b/w \\"I Keep A-Tellin You\\" (Old Town 1133‚Äì1963). The group scored another hit in 1963 on Old Town with \\"Eyes\\" b/w \\"Look My Way\\" (Old Town 1141). Later, a demo \\"I Believe\\" was released (Old Town 1149‚Äì1963) b/w \\"Don‚Äôt Forget\\". \\"I Believe\\" became a much bigger record from the 1970s onward as it received heavy airplay on NYC oldies radio. Chance later had a brief solo career, recording \\"Let Them Talk\\". He returned to the Earls who, at that time, had two new members ‚Äì Bob Moricco and Ronnie Calabrese. The group started playing their own instruments and, in 1967, recorded \\"If I Could Do It Over\\" b/w \\"Papa\\" (Mr. G 801 ‚Äì 1967), and a track for ABC Records, \\"Its Been a Long Time Coming\\" b/w \\"In My Lonely Room\\" (ABC 11109‚Äì1967). The group continued performing into the 1970s and, in 1977, they released a disco version of The Velvets' \\"Tonight (Could Be the Night).\\" By 1983, the group's personnel were Chance, Ronnie Calabrese, Colon Rello, Bobby Tribuzio and Tony Obert, and they recorded Larry Chance and the Earls ‚Äì Today. From 1989-1993, the group consisted of: Larry Chance, Bobby Tribuzzio, Bob Coleman, Art Loria (formerly of The Belmonts) and T.J. Barbella. This roster continued a busy performance schedule and studio works. In 1989, they were on Broadway performing in the original production of A Bronx Tale, a one man play by Chazz Palminteri. They recorded the theme song of the production \\"Streets of the Bronx\\", which was slated to appear on the soundtrack of the motion picture A Bronx Tale, however a different version of the song was eventually chosen. Two albums were released: Larry Chance and the Earls (Live!) and Earl Change. Another single released in 1989 was \\"Elvis:He's Alive\\", which was warmly received by critics and received a BMI Award of Recognition of a Musical Work. They were nominated as \\"Best Musical Act\\" in Atlantic City for their eight week run at The Claridge Hotel, starring with Sal Richards. Larry Chance and the Earls performing live in Florida - 1995. (L-R) Art Loria, Bobby T, Larry Chance, Bob Coleman Loria and Barbella left the group in 1993. Chance, Tribuzio and Coleman remain as the groups core with a rotation of members rounding out the act. They continue to perform and record and are considered to be popular on the doo wop / oldies revival circuit. In 2008, the group was honored with a place on The Bronx Walk of Fame. Former member Art Loria died October 23, 2010. He performed and recorded with the group for eight years in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He was the co-writer with Barbella of the group's tribute to Presley, \\"Elvis: He's Alive\\". The song was recognized by Billboard magazine and BMI and the group was presented with an award for recognition of a song worthy to keep an ear out for. (Billboard Magazine Article 12/7/91 pg #72) Larry Chance later went on to record He's Alive on his solo.album, Larry Chance Sings Country.

Despite sometimes being called an exchange force in an analogy to classical force, it is not a true force as it lacks a force carrier. The effect is due to the wave function of indistinguishable particles being subject to exchange symmetry, that is, either remaining unchanged (symmetric) or changing sign (antisymmetric) when two particles are exchanged. Both bosons and fermions can experience the exchange interaction. For fermions, this interaction is sometimes called Pauli repulsion and is related to the Pauli exclusion principle. For bosons, the exchange interaction takes the form of an effective attraction that causes identical particles to be found closer together, as in Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensation. The exchange interaction alters the expectation value of the distance when the wave functions of two or more indistinguishable particles overlap. This interaction increases (for fermions) or decreases (for bosons) the expectation value of the distance between identical particles (compared to distinguishable particles).David J. Griffiths: Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, Second Edition, pp. 207‚Äì210 Among other consequences, the exchange interaction is responsible for ferromagnetism and the volume of matter. It has no classical analogue. Exchange interaction effects were discovered independently by physicists Werner HeisenbergMehrk√∂rperproblem und Resonanz in der Quantenmechanik, W. Heisenberg, Zeitschrift f√ºr Physik 38, #6‚Äì7 (June 1926), pp. 411‚Äì426. DOI 10.1007/BF01397160. and Paul Dirac in 1926. \\"Force\\" description The exchange interaction is sometimes called the exchange force. However, it is not a true force and should not be confused with the exchange forces produced by the exchange of force carriers, such as the electromagnetic force produced between two electrons by the exchange of a photon, or the strong force between two quarks produced by the exchange of a gluon.Exchange Forces, HyperPhysics, Georgia State University, accessed June 2, 2007. Although sometimes erroneously described as a force, the exchange interaction is a purely quantum mechanical effect unlike other forces. Exchange interactions between localized electron magnetic moments Quantum mechanical particles are classified as bosons or fermions. The spin‚Äìstatistics theorem of quantum field theory demands that all particles with half-integer spin behave as fermions and all particles with integer spin behave as bosons. Multiple bosons may occupy the same quantum state; however, by the Pauli exclusion principle, no two fermions can occupy the same state. Since electrons have spin 1/2, they are fermions. This means that the overall wave function of a system must be antisymmetric when two electrons are exchanged, i.e. interchanged with respect to both spatial and spin coordinates. First, however, exchange will be explained with the neglect of spin. Exchange of spatial coordinates Taking a hydrogen molecule-like system (i.e. one with two electrons), one may attempt to model the state of each electron by first assuming the electrons behave independently, and taking wave functions in position space of \\\\Phi_a(r_1) for the first electron and \\\\Phi_b(r_2) for the second electron. We assume that \\\\Phi_a and \\\\Phi_b are orthogonal, and that each corresponds to an energy eigenstate of its electron. Now, one may construct a wave function for the overall system in position space by using an antisymmetric combination of the product wave functions in position space: [\\\\Phi_a(\\\\vec r_1) \\\\Phi_b(\\\\vec r_2) - \\\\Phi_b(\\\\vec r_1) \\\\Phi_a(\\\\vec r_2)]}} Alternatively, we may also construct the overall position‚Äìspace wave function by using a symmetric combination of the product wave functions in position space: [\\\\Phi_a(\\\\vec r_1) \\\\Phi_b(\\\\vec r_2) + \\\\Phi_b(\\\\vec r_1) \\\\Phi_a(\\\\vec r_2)]}} Treating the exchange interaction in the hydrogen molecule by the perturbation method, the overall Hamiltonian is: :\\\\mathcal{H} = \\\\mathcal{H}^{(0)} + \\\\mathcal{H}^{(1)} where \\\\mathcal{H}^{(0)} = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\left(\\\\Delta_{1} + \\\\Delta_{2}\\\\right)-\\\\frac{e^2}{r_{1}}-\\\\frac{e^2}{r_{2}} and \\\\mathcal{H}^{(1)} = \\\\left(\\\\frac {e^2}{R_{ab}} + \\\\frac {e^2}{r_{12}} - \\\\frac {e^2}{r_{a1}} - \\\\frac {e^2}{r_{b2}}\\\\right) The terms in parentheses correspond to: proton‚Äìproton repulsion (Rab), electron‚Äìelectron repulsion (r12), and electron‚Äìproton attraction (ra1/a2/b1/b2). All quantities are assumed to be real. Two eigenvalues for the system energy are found: {1 \\\\pm S^2}}} where the E+ is the spatially symmetric solution and E‚àí is the spatially antisymmetric solution. A variational calculation yields similar results. \\\\mathcal{H} can be diagonalized by using the position‚Äìspace functions given by Eqs. (1) and (2). In Eq. (3), C is the two-site two-electron Coulomb integral (It may be interpreted as the repulsive potential for electron-one at a particular point \\\\Phi_a(\\\\vec r_1)^2 in an electric field created by electron-two distributed over the space with the probability density \\\\Phi_b(\\\\vec r_2)^2), S is the overlap integral, and Jex is the exchange integral, which is similar to the two-site Coulomb integral but includes exchange of the two electrons. It has no simple physical interpretation, but it can be shown to arise entirely due to the anti-symmetry requirement. These integrals are given by: \\\\+ \\\\frac{1}{r_{12}} - \\\\frac{1}{r_{a1}} - \\\\frac{1}{r_{b2}}\\\\right) \\\\Phi_b(\\\\vec r_2)^2 \\\\, d^3r_1\\\\, d^3r_2}} \\\\+ \\\\frac{1}{r_{12}} - \\\\frac{1}{r_{a1}} - \\\\frac{1}{r_{b2}}\\\\right) \\\\Phi_b(\\\\vec r_1) \\\\Phi_a(\\\\vec r_2) \\\\, d^3r_1\\\\, d^3r_2}} Although in the hydrogen molecule the exchange integral, Eq. (6), is negative, Heisenberg first suggested that it changes sign at some critical ratio of internuclear distance to mean radial extension of the atomic orbital.Derivation of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, Rebecca Hihinashvili, accessed on line October 2, 2007.Quantum Theory of Magnetism: Magnetic Properties of Materials, Robert M. White, 3rd rev. ed., Berlin: Springer- Verlag, 2007, section 2.2.7. .The Theory of Electric and Magnetic Susceptibilities, J. H. van Vleck, London: Oxford University Press, 1932, chapter XII, section 76. Inclusion of spin The symmetric and antisymmetric combinations in Equations (1) and (2) did not include the spin variables (Œ± = spin-up; Œ≤ = spin down); there are also antisymmetric and symmetric combinations of the spin variables: To obtain the overall wave function, these spin combinations have to be coupled with Eqs. (1) and (2). The resulting overall wave functions, called spin-orbitals, are written as Slater determinants. When the orbital wave function is symmetrical the spin one must be anti-symmetrical and vice versa. Accordingly, E+ above corresponds to the spatially symmetric/spin-singlet solution and E‚àí to the spatially antisymmetric/spin-triplet solution. J. H. Van Vleck presented the following analysis:Van Vleck, J. H.: Electric and Magnetic Susceptibilities, Oxford, Clarendon Press, p. 318 (1932). :The potential energy of the interaction between the two electrons in orthogonal orbitals can be represented by a matrix, say Eex. From Eq. (3), the characteristic values of this matrix are C ¬± Jex. The characteristic values of a matrix are its diagonal elements after it is converted to a diagonal matrix. Now, the characteristic values of the square of the magnitude of the resultant spin, \\\\langle (\\\\vec{s}_a + \\\\vec{s}_b)^2 \\\\rangle is S(S+1). The characteristic values of the matrices \\\\langle \\\\vec{s}_a^{\\\\;2}\\\\rangle and \\\\langle \\\\vec{s}_b^{\\\\;2}\\\\rangle are each \\\\tfrac{1}{2}(\\\\tfrac{1}{2} + 1) = \\\\tfrac{3}{4} and \\\\langle(\\\\vec{s}_a + \\\\vec{s}_b)^2\\\\rangle = \\\\langle\\\\vec{s}_a^{\\\\;2}\\\\rangle + \\\\langle\\\\vec{s}_b^{\\\\;2}\\\\rangle + 2\\\\langle\\\\vec{s}_a \\\\cdot \\\\vec{s}_b\\\\rangle. The characteristic values of the scalar product \\\\langle\\\\vec{s}_a \\\\cdot \\\\vec{s}_b\\\\rangle are \\\\tfrac{1}{2}(0 - \\\\tfrac{6}{4})= -\\\\tfrac{3}{4} and \\\\tfrac{1}{2}(2 - \\\\tfrac{6}{4}) = \\\\tfrac{1}{4}, corresponding to both the spin- singlet (S = 0) and spin-triplet (S = 1) states, respectively. :From Eq. (3) and the aforementioned relations, the matrix Eex is seen to have the characteristic value C + Jex when \\\\langle\\\\vec{s}_a \\\\cdot \\\\vec{s}_b\\\\rangle has the characteristic value ‚àí3/4 (i.e. when S = 0; the spatially symmetric/spin-singlet state). Alternatively, it has the characteristic value C ‚àí Jex when \\\\langle \\\\vec{s}_a \\\\cdot \\\\vec{s}_b\\\\rangle has the characteristic value +1/4 (i.e. when S = 1; the spatially antisymmetric/spin-triplet state). Therefore,'' :and, hence, :where the spin momenta are given as \\\\langle\\\\vec{s}_a\\\\rangle and \\\\langle\\\\vec{s}_b\\\\rangle. Dirac pointed out that the critical features of the exchange interaction could be obtained in an elementary way by neglecting the first two terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (9), thereby considering the two electrons as simply having their spins coupled by a potential of the form: It follows that the exchange interaction Hamiltonian between two electrons in orbitals Œ¶a and Œ¶b can be written in terms of their spin momenta \\\\vec{s}_a and \\\\vec{s}_b . This is named the Heisenberg exchange Hamiltonian or the Heisenberg‚ÄìDirac Hamiltonian in the older literature: Jab is not the same as the quantity labeled Jex in Eq. (6). Rather, Jab, which is termed the exchange constant, is a function of Eqs. (4), (5), and (6), namely, However, with orthogonal orbitals (in which S = 0), for example with different orbitals in the same atom, Jab = Jex. Effects of exchange If Jab is positive the exchange energy favors electrons with parallel spins; this is a primary cause of ferromagnetism in materials in which the electrons are considered localized in the Heitler‚ÄìLondon model of chemical bonding, but this model of ferromagnetism has severe limitations in solids (see below). If Jab is negative, the interaction favors electrons with antiparallel spins, potentially causing antiferromagnetism. The sign of Jab is essentially determined by the relative sizes of Jex and the product of CS2. This can be deduced from the expression for the difference between the energies of the triplet and singlet states, E‚àí ‚àí E+: Although these consequences of the exchange interaction are magnetic in nature, the cause is not; it is due primarily to electric repulsion and the Pauli exclusion principle. In general, the direct magnetic interaction between a pair of electrons (due to their electron magnetic moments) is negligibly small compared to this electric interaction. Exchange energy splittings are very elusive to calculate for molecular systems at large internuclear distances. However, analytical formulae have been worked out for the hydrogen molecular ion (see references herein). Normally, exchange interactions are very short- ranged, confined to electrons in orbitals on the same atom (intra-atomic exchange) or nearest neighbor atoms (direct exchange) but longer-ranged interactions can occur via intermediary atoms and this is termed superexchange. Direct exchange interactions in solids In a crystal, generalization of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian in which the sum is taken over the exchange Hamiltonians for all the (i,j) pairs of atoms of the many- electron system gives:. The 1/2 factor is introduced because the interaction between the same two atoms is counted twice in performing the sums. Note that the J in Eq.(14) is the exchange constant Jab above not the exchange integral Jex. The exchange integral Jex is related to yet another quantity, called the exchange stiffness constant (A) which serves as a characteristic of a ferromagnetic material. The relationship is dependent on the crystal structure. For a simple cubic lattice with lattice parameter a, For a body- centered cubic lattice, and for a face-centered cubic lattice, The form of Eq. (14) corresponds identically to the Ising model of ferromagnetism except that in the Ising model, the dot product of the two spin angular momenta is replaced by the scalar product SijSji. The Ising model was invented by Wilhelm Lenz in 1920 and solved for the one-dimensional case by his doctoral student Ernst Ising in 1925. The energy of the Ising model is defined to be: Limitations of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian and the localized electron model in solids Because the Heisenberg Hamiltonian presumes the electrons involved in the exchange coupling are localized in the context of the Heitler‚ÄìLondon, or valence bond (VB), theory of chemical bonding, it is an adequate model for explaining the magnetic properties of electrically insulating narrow-band ionic and covalent non-molecular solids where this picture of the bonding is reasonable. Nevertheless, theoretical evaluations of the exchange integral for non-molecular solids that display metallic conductivity in which the electrons responsible for the ferromagnetism are itinerant (e.g. iron, nickel, and cobalt) have historically been either of the wrong sign or much too small in magnitude to account for the experimentally determined exchange constant (e.g. as estimated from the Curie temperatures via TC ‚âà 2‚ü®J‚ü©/3kB where ‚ü®J‚ü© is the exchange interaction averaged over all sites). The Heisenberg model thus cannot explain the observed ferromagnetism in these materials. In these cases, a delocalized, or Hund‚ÄìMulliken‚ÄìBloch (molecular orbital/band) description, for the electron wave functions is more realistic. Accordingly, the Stoner model of ferromagnetism is more applicable. In the Stoner model, the spin-only magnetic moment (in Bohr magnetons) per atom in a ferromagnet is given by the difference between the number of electrons per atom in the majority spin and minority spin states. The Stoner model thus permits non-integral values for the spin-only magnetic moment per atom. However, with ferromagnets \\\\mu_S = - g \\\\mu_B [S(S+1)]^{1/2} (g = 2.0023 ‚âà 2) tends to overestimate the total spin-only magnetic moment per atom. For example, a net magnetic moment of 0.54 ŒºB per atom for Nickel metal is predicted by the Stoner model, which is very close to the 0.61 Bohr magnetons calculated based on the metal's observed saturation magnetic induction, its density, and its atomic weight.Elliot, S. R.: The Physics and Chemistry of Solids, John Wiley & Sons, New York, p. 615 (1998) By contrast, an isolated Ni atom (electron configuration = 3d84s2) in a cubic crystal field will have two unpaired electrons of the same spin (hence, \\\\vec{S} = 1) and would thus be expected to have in the localized electron model a total spin magnetic moment of \\\\mu_S = 2.83 \\\\mu_B (but the measured spin-only magnetic moment along one axis, the physical observable, will be given by \\\\vec{\\\\mu}_S = g \\\\mu_B \\\\vec{S} = 2 \\\\mu_B). Generally, valence s and p electrons are best considered delocalized, while 4f electrons are localized and 5f and 3d/4d electrons are intermediate, depending on the particular internuclear distances.J. B. Goodenough: Magnetism and the Chemical Bond, Interscience Publishers, New York, pp. 5‚Äì17 (1966). In the case of substances where both delocalized and localized electrons contribute to the magnetic properties (e.g. rare-earth systems), the Ruderman‚ÄìKittel‚ÄìKasuya‚ÄìYosida (RKKY) model is the currently accepted mechanism.

Mueang was originally a term in the Tai languages for a town having a defensive wall and a ruler with at least the Thai noble rank of khun (), together with its dependent villages. The mandala model of political organisation organised states in collective hierarchy such that smaller mueang were subordinate to more powerful neighboring ones, which in turn were subordinate to a central king or other leader. The more powerful mueang (generally designated as chiang, wiang, nakhon or krung ‚Äî with Bangkok as Krung Thep Maha Nakhon) occasionally tried to liberate themselves from their suzerain and could enjoy periods of relative independence. Mueang large and small often shifted allegiance, and frequently paid tribute to more than one powerful neighbor ‚Äî the most powerful of the period being Ming China. Following Kublai Khan's defeat of the Dali Kingdom of the Bai people in 1253 and its establishment as a tutelary state, new mueang were founded widely throughout the Shan States and adjoining regions ‚Äî though the common description of this as a \\"mass migration\\" is disputed. Following historical Chinese practice, tribal leaders principally in Yunnan were recognized by the Yuan as imperial officials, in an arrangement generally known as the Tusi (\\"Native Chieftain\\") system. Ming and Qing-era dynasties gradually replaced native chieftains with non-native Chinese government officials. In the 19th century, Thailand's Chakri dynasty and Burma's colonial and subsequent military rulers did much the same with their lesser mueang, but, while the petty kingdoms are gone, the place names remain.

The usage is of special historic interest for the Lao; in particular for their traditional socio-political and administrative organisation, and the formation of their early (power) states, described by later scholars as Mandala (Southeast Asian political model). Provinces of Laos are now subdivided into what are commonly translated as districts of Laos, with some retaining Muang as part of the name: *Muang Sing *Muang Xay *Former Muang **Muang Phuan (modern Phonsavan, capital city of Xiangkhouang Province) **Muang Sua Myanmar *Mong Mao *Mong Hsat *Mong Hpayak *Mong Ton *Mong Nai *Mong Ping *Mohnyin (former Mongyang State) *Mogaung (former Mongkawng) *Momauk *Mogok *Momeik Northeast India * Mong Dun Shun Kham ‚Äî- The Mueang (currently the states of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh in North-East India), established by a Tai Prince Sukaphaa in 1228 with 9000 Tai People migrated from Mong Mao called as Ahom by local people, transformed itself into a huge kingdom by the 17th century that withstood the might of the Mughal Empire.  Thailand  Thailand is colloquially known as Mueang Thai. After the Thesaphiban reforms of Prince Damrong Rajanubhab, city- states under Siam were organized into monthon (, Thai translation of mandala), which was changed to changwat () in 1916. Mueang still can be found as the term for the capital districts of the provinces (amphoe mueang), as well as for a municipal status equivalent to town (thesaban mueang).

M√ºang Fai irrigation system  M√ºang Fai is a term reconstructed from Proto-Tai, the common ancestor of all Tai languages. In the Guangxi-Guizhou of Southern China region, the term described what was then a unique type of irrigation engineering for wet-rice cultivation. M√ºang meaning 'irrigation channel, ditch, canal' and Fai, 'dike, weir, dam.' together referred to gravitational irrigation systems for directing water from streams and rivers. The Proto-Tai language is not directly attested by any surviving texts, but has been reconstructed using the comparative method. This term has Proto-Tai-tone A1. All A1 words are rising tone in modern Thai and Lao, following rules determined for tone origin.

Different linguistic tones give different meanings; scholarship has not established a link between this term and any of the terms which differ in tone.  Origin of mueang  Mueang conveys many meanings, all having to do with administrative, social, political and religious orientation on wet-rice cultivation. The origin of the word mueang yet remains obscure. In October 2007, The National Library of Laos, in collaboration with the Berlin State Library and the University of Passau, started a project to produce the Digital Library of Lao Manuscripts. Papers presented at the Literary Heritage of Laos Conference, held in Vientiane in 2005, have also been made available.

The settlement is on the B4011 road between Oakley and Long Crendon. The largely depopulated former settlement now consists of only Addingrove Farm and a cottage. It is in the civil parish of Oakley. Toponym The toponym Addingrove is derived from the Old English for \\"√Üddi's wood\\", after √Üddi, the biographer of Saint Wilfrid. From the 11th to the 15th centuries it evolved through the forms Eddingrave, Adegrave and Adingrave before reaching its present form. Manor The Domesday Book of 1086 records that Ulward, a man of Queen Edith, the manor of Eddingrave in the reign of Edward the Confessor, but that after the Norman conquest of England it was granted to Walter Giffard and assessed at three and a half hides. Addingrove remained part of the Honour until 1256, when Giffard's descendant Joan Marshal became married to William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke. After the death of Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke in 1324, Addingrove passed to William's granddaughter Elizabeth de Comyn. It then passed by Elizabeth's second marriage to Richard Talbot, 2nd Baron Talbot. Talbot also held the manor of Pollicott in Ashendon. When Gilbert Talbot, 5th Baron Talbot died in 1419 he left the manors of Pollicott and Addingrove to his widow Beatrice, who was baroness in her own right until her death in 1421. The two manors were again recorded together in 1432 and 1446, but no subsequent records are known. Walter Giffard's mesne lord was Hugh de Bolebec, whose heirs were the Earls of Oxford. The mesne lordshire of Addingrove followed that of Whitchurch until 1635. By 1173 the sub-tenants of the Earls of Oxford were a family called Morel. In 1257 John Morel granted parts of Oakley and Addingrove to John FitzNeil, who then bought the remainder of the manorial tenure from Morel's heirs. Thereafter the tenancy of Addingrove was linked with that of Boarstall until 1563. From 1554 the farm was let to John Croke of Chilton. Croke left the tenancy to his son, also John Dormer, who in 1607 was renting the farm from Sir John Dormer of Dorton. Dormer left Addingrove to his son Sir Robert Dormer, who is said to have passed it to a family called Mitchell. In the 18th century Addingrove passed from Richard Mitchell to Sir John Aubrey, 6th Baronet. Aubrey held the manor of Boarstall, so thereafter Addingrove was once again linked with that manor. After Addingrove was deserted, its land was divided amongst the villages of Oakley, Brill and Chilton. Chapel In about 1142 the Empress Maud granted Oakley church and its dependent chapelries of Brill, Boarstall and Addingrove, to the Augustinian Priory of St Frideswide, Oxford. Addingrove chapel still existed in 1318. Late in the 18th century Addingrove was still a hamlet in the parish of Oakley, but its chapel had been \\"suffered to fall to ruin\\". Hamlet The possible site of the deserted medieval village and former chapel of Addingrove may be about north of Addingrove Farm. The only remaining building on the site is a derelict barn, but Ordnance Survey maps of 1878 and 1885 show this as the site of the original Addingrove Farm. Slight hollows suggest where a house may have stood, a slight baulk suggests the route of a former track, and ridge and furrow to the west, south and southeast suggest where the limits of the former settlement may have been. About east of Addingrove Farm the B4011 road between Oakley and Long Crendon crosses a stream, next to which on the east side of the road is a rectilinear medieval ditch that the stream used to feed. The ditch was about wide and may have been a moat, but there is no trace of a manor house having stood within the rectangle. It may therefore have been a fishpond.

One clause which was included in the Treason Act 1695 was later adapted for the United States Constitution. Two witnesses rule The most important feature of the Act was that it reintroduced a significant new rule of evidence in high treason trials, namely that nobody could be convicted of treason except by the evidence of \\"two lawful and credible witnesses upon oath... brought in person before him or them face to face,\\" or if he confessed \\"willingly without violence.\\" (This rule had previously been enacted in section 22 of the Treason Act 1547, and again in section XI of the Treason Act 1554, which however differed from the other versions by only requiring the witnesses \\"if [they were] living and within the realm\\".) This clause of the 1661 Act, section 5, was replaced by the Treason Act 1695, which added that the two witnesses had to have witnessed the same offence (although not necessarily the same \\"overt act\\" of the offence).Sections 2 and 4. The rule was inherited by the United States and was incorporated into the US Constitution in 1787, which added that both witnesses had to have witnessed the same overt act.Article III, section 3 Section 5 of the 1661 Act was cited by US Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia in his judgement in Crawford v. Washington, a case about the \\"Confrontation Clause\\" of the Sixth Amendment.Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), .pdf file, page 10 The 1661 version of this rule only applied to the new forms of treason (and other offences) which were created by the 1661 Act (see the New offences section below). The 1695 Act applied to all forms of high treason, except counterfeiting coins. The rule was abolished in the United Kingdom by the Treason Act 1945, which made the rules of evidence and procedure in treason cases the same as in a murder trial.9 Geo. VI c. 44 During the passage of the Treason Bill through Parliament the Home Secretary, Sir Donald Somervell, said: Sir William Blackstone wrote in his Commentaries on the Laws of England: New offences=Treason The Act created four new kinds of high treason, in addition to those already existing. The Act made it treason to: or, \\"‚Ä¶within the realm or without, compass, imagine, invent, devise or intend\\": * to deprive the King of his crown * to levy war against the King, \\"within this realm, or without\\" * to \\"move or stir\\" any foreigner to invade England or any other country belonging to the King (this latter clause was derived from the Rump Parliament's Treasons Act 1649, which had been repealed in 1660) These provisions were expressed only to have effect during the lifetime of the King, Charles II. However they were temporarily re-enacted, with two modifications, by the Treason Act 1795,36 Geo. 3 c. 7 and then made permanent by the Treason Act 1817. In the 1795 version, \\"the realm\\" meant Great Britain (in 1848 the Act was extended to cover IrelandTreason Felony Act 1848, section 2 (repealed)), and levying war against the King was only an offence under the Act if done in order to compel the King to change his policies or to \\"intimidate or overawe\\" Parliament. (However under the Treason Act 1351, which was not affected, levying war against the King was still treason, without these additional criteria.) The difference between the Treason Act 1351 and the Acts of 1661 and 1795 was that while the 1351 Act required an actual levying of war, the later Acts also made it treason to \\"compass, imagine, invent, devise, or intend\\" a levying of war.The Law Commission (1977). Treason, Sedition and Allied Offences (Working Paper No.72), page 12, footnote 39.BAILII (.pdf file) The penalty for treason was death. However the last three treasons on the above list were reduced to felonies by the Treason Felony Act 1848, which made the maximum sentence life imprisonment. The 1848 Act is still in force (see article for a fuller quote from the text). Imprisoning or otherwise harming the Sovereign continued to be high treason, punishable by death, until the 1795 Act was repealed by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. However assaulting the Sovereign is still an offence under the Treason Act 1842, which carries a maximum sentence of seven years. In some Commonwealth of Nations countries, such as Canada,Canadian Criminal Code, section 46 AustraliaAustralian Criminal Code and New ZealandCrimes Act 1961, section 73 it is still treason to imprison or harm the Queen. Other offences Besides treason, the 1661 Act created other offences designed to protect the national security. These offences required the evidence of two witnesses or a confession, and had to be prosecuted within six months of the offence being committed. The king had to personally authorise a prosecution. Anyone who in speech or writing called the King a heretic or papist, or who incited \\"hatred or dislike of the Person of His Majestie or the established Government\\" was to be disqualified from holding any public, military or ecclesiastical office (but could keep his peerage). This measure was expressed only to last during the King's lifetime. A permanent offence (until it was repealed) was committed by any person who claimed (in writing or in speech) that the Long Parliament had not been dissolved, or that anyone had a duty to obey an oath to change the government, or that Parliament could legislate without the king's assent. Other provisions The Act declared that the Solemn League and Covenant was null and void. It also preserved Parliament's privilege of free speech, and the right of a peer to be tried in the House of Lords. A peer who was convicted of any offence under the Act was to be disqualified from sitting in the House of Lords, unless pardoned (although he would keep his title). Repeal Sections 1 and 2 were repealed on 28 January 1863 by section 1 of, and the Schedule to, the Statute Law Revision Act 1863. There were some other repeals over the years, and then the whole Act, so far as unrepealed, was repealed by the Criminal Law Act 1967.

Most buildings are painted the same color and homes in the community look similar as a result. There are no stores or gas stations. Construction on the original Moccasin Powerhouse was started in Fall 1921. The facility was completed and began generating power on August 14, 1925. Paul James Ost was the electrical engineer put in charge of power operations and electrical engineering phases of the Hetch Hetchy project. The original powerhouse was removed from operation February 7, 1969. The present-day Moccasin Powerhouse was completed and placed in operation January 27, 1969. The facility's rated capacity is 100,000 kVA and there is a second 3,000 kVA generator called Moccasin Low Head Generating Plant, (completed 1986). The town site is a significant facility along the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct system. History During the Gold Rush, the locale was a stage coach stop on Big Oak Flat Road. A covered bridge was built to allow crossing of Moccasin Creek during the wet season. There was a mining camp along Moccasin Creek and east of town along Priest Grade. Robberies were frequent during years when gold miners were successful in the area.Paden, Irene and Margaret D. Schlictmann, The Big Oak Flat Road, (Oakland, California: Emil P Schlictmann, 1955). Priest Grade and Old Priest Grade Immediately east of town, State Route 120 climbs from about AMSL elevation to about at Priest Station, California, over a distance of 4.5 miles (10 km). Old Priest Grade, a narrower road and predecessor to the current route of SR120, covers the same change in elevation over about . It is common to see vehicles with smoking brakes descending the old grade. During summer, ambient temperatures can be in the 90~100 ¬∞F range. In these temperatures, many vehicles overheat climbing the old grade. For this reason, bottles of water are available at turnouts along Old Priest Grade to fill overheating vehicles. A sign on Highway 120 also advises drivers to turn off air conditioning in order to prevent overheating while climbing either grade. Locals tell stories of car accidents in history where the vehicles left the path of Old Priest Grade and tumbled into Grizzly Gulch. The hillsides are sturdy chaparral with thick vegetation. The terrain was so difficult that, in a few cases, the cars and bodies were not retrieved, some locals claim.

It was developed by D.E. Yount and others for use in professional diving and recreational diving. It was developed to model laboratory observations of bubble formation and growth in both inanimate and in vivo systems exposed to pressure. In 1986, this model was applied by researchers at the University of Hawaii to calculate diving decompression tables. The VPM presumes that microscopic bubble nuclei always exist in water and tissues that contain water. Any nuclei larger than a specific \\"critical\\" size, which is related to the maximum dive depth (exposure pressure), will grow upon decompression (when the diver ascends again). The VPM aims to minimize the total volume of these growing bubbles by keeping the external pressure large, and the inspired inert gas partial pressures low during decompression. The model depends on the assumptions that different sizes of bubbles exist within the body; that the larger bubbles require less reduction in pressure to begin to grow than smaller ones; and that fewer large bubbles exist than smaller ones.

This allows them to peer, which circumvents the costly earlier intercommunication arrangements. This is a major milestone in the development of Internet services in Botswana, as it will improve quality of service and stimulate the growth of local content and Internet usage in the country. Internet Service Providers Association (BISPA) Secretary, Katlego Nkwe, says that the Botswana Internet Exchange (BINX) should help the country develop in the Information Communication Technology (ICT) sector and assist in bridging the digital divide between first and third world countries. Details Nkwe explained that with BINX fully developed and in the latter stages of testing, Botswana websites would be able to communicate between each other more efficiently, as the speed of access will be greatly improved. The Exchange has been set up by the BISPA, which is made up of eight local ISPs and the government's Department of Information Technology (DIT). \\"The ISPs have contributed the funds to build the Exchange and each of the members has made its link to BINX. Some have made wireless connections, while others have opted to use Botswana Telecommunications Corporation 's (BTC) terrestrial links,\\" she said. \\"This will make websites being hosted in Botswana much faster to load as information would no longer need to travel to different nodes in overseas countries anymore. The local web traffic stays in the country.\\" It is hoped that with BINX now in place, e-commerce sites will be stimulated, as the quality of the ISPs service will be highly improved.\\" For example Internet Banking, if hosted in Botswana, would become much faster,\\" she explained. The exchange is based at the Global Bytes Group's premises ‚Äì one of the BISPA members. There is still the need to bridge the rural-urban digital divide in Botswana and make information technology more accessible and useful for the people in the remote areas of the country. \\"Some of the challenges still to be overcome are of infrastructure, power availability, and BTC's prohibitive tariffs,\\" she said. The next step is to enhance regional communication by setting up an Internet Exchange for SADC countries. The Botswana Telecommunications Authority (BTA) hosted the workshop and the second and last phase of WSIS will be held in Tunis, Tunisia in November.

Identical provision was made for Ireland by the Treason by Women Act (Ireland) 1796. Section 1 The original penalty for high treason, petty treason or abetting counselling or procuring petty treason for women was to be drawn to the place of execution and burned to death. This was replaced, with effect from 5 June 1790, with drawing to the place of execution followed by hanging by section 1. The section was amended by the Forfeiture Act 1870 to abolish drawing. Section 2 This section made provision for women convicted of petty treason to suffer additional punishments which were already provided for murder by the Murder Act 1751 (25 Geo.2 c.37), ss. 1 - 10. This included provision for the disposal of the body. The repeal of this section for England and Wales on 1 July 1828 by section 1 of the Offences against the Person Act 1828 was consequential on the abolition of petty treason by sections 1 and 2 of that Act. Section 3 This section allowed the King to alter the sentence of any woman condemned to burning having been convicted of those offences prior to (the commencement of section 1 on) 5 June 1790. By warrant under the hand of one of the principal Secretaries of State, the King had the discretionary (\\"if he shall think proper\\") authority to order that the condemned woman be hanged in the execution of that judgement. This section was repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1871. Section 4 This section was a saving clause and provided that women convicted of those offences would still be liable to such forfeitures and corruption of blood as they would have been if they had been attainted of those offences before the passing of the Act. This section was repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1960. Repeal The Act was repealed when the death penalty for treason was abolished by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.

The band's music combines avant-garde elements of progressive rock and jazz with heavy metal. They are currently located in Brooklyn, New York. Their most recent release, The Veil of Control, was released in September 2016 via Profound Lore Records.  History  The band was formed in August 1998 by guitarist Kevin Hufnagel and bassist Clayton Ingerson, who were joined six months later by drummer Jeff Eber. The band entered the studio in early 2000 to record their debut album, Contradiction, which was recorded, like every other Dysrhythmia album to follow, completely live with minimal overdubs. Shortly thereafter, the band reentered the studio in 2001 to record the No Interference record. The new album helped to define and expand the band's sound, and was followed by extensive touring. In 2002, the band released two split albums, a 10\\" vinyl record with Thoughtstreams and a 7\\" split with Technician.Smnnews.com The band signed to Relapse Records in October 2002. Entitled Pretest, their first album with Relapse was released May 13, 2003 to positive critical acclaim. Metal Hammer Magazine named Pretest one of the Top 10 Essential Mathcore albums of all time, while Revolver Magazine ranked the album among the top 20 albums of 2003 alongside of records by Radiohead, Metallica and others. The band began touring with bigger named acts such as Mastodon, Cephalic Carnage and The Dillinger Escape Plan, and playing large music festivals including the 2003 and 2004 Relapse Contamination tour, the Relapse Records South by Southwest showcase in Austin, Texas, and the New England Metal and Hardcore festival, where the band was profiled by both MTV2 and Fuse. Ingerson left the group in November 2004. To replace Ingerson, Dysrhythmia recruited Colin Marston, a member of the group Behold...The Arctopus (in which he plays a 12-string Warr guitar). Dysrhythmia next embarked on tours with Isis and These Arms are Snakes. They recorded and released their fourth full-length album, Barriers and Passages, at B.C. Studios in Brooklyn with engineer Martin Bisi, who had previously worked with John Zorn and Sonic Youth. Barriers and Passages was released on May 2, 2006 in North America and May 9 internationally. The band continued touring throughout 2006 and 2007, and released a split album with Rothko in late 2007. Dysrhythmia stayed relatively quiet in 2008 as Hufnagel and Marston pursued their own individual projects. Marston continued recording and touring with Behold...The Arctopus and Krallice, while Hufnagel released a full-length solo album entitled Songs for the Disappeared via his own imprint Nightfloat Recordings. Both Hufnagel and Marston also joined the long-standing technical death metal band Gorguts. After the short break, Dysrhythmia entered their own Menegroth Studios in Queens, New York to record their fifth full- length release, Psychic Maps. The album was engineered and produced by Marston and was released July 7, 2009 in North America and July 13 internationally via Relapse. They began touring in October 2009 in support of the new album.Smnnews.com Tours included their first European run in June and July 2010, and a U.S. and Canadian tour following shortly after, supporting Cynic, and Intronaut. In May 2012 the band entered Marston's studio again to record their sixth full-length studio album entitled Test of Submission, released on August 28, 2012 on Profound Lore Records.

It was the first of three ships of the White Star Line to sail with Britannic name. Britannic was a single-screw passenger steamship equipped with sails built for the White Star Line's North Atlantic run. It was initially to be called Hellenic, but, just prior to her launch, her name was changed to Britannic. Together with her sister Germanic, Britannic sailed for nearly thirty years, primarily carrying immigrant passengers on the highly trafficked Liverpool to New York City route. In 1876 it received the Blue Riband, both westbound and eastbound, by averaging almost . Accommodations The Britannic and her sister Germanic were both built to carry a total of 1,720 passengers in two classes when fully booked, 220 Saloon Class Passengers (Title of First Class at that time) and 1,500 Steerage Passengers. As the ships were virtually larger versions of the \\"Oceanic\\" class ships built in the previous years, their accommodations were very similar, with some variances to give each ship its own character. Britannics saloon accommodations, consisting of a large, spacious dining saloon and a large number of two- and four-berth cabins were located in the centre of the ship on the main deck, being the upper of the two decks enclosed within the hull above the waterline. The steerage accommodations were located on the two lower decks and consisted of large dormitory-style cabins capable of sleeping up to 20 passengers lined against the hull, with an open space running along the centre line of the ship where passengers could congregate. These accommodations were divided into two main sections at either end of the ship, berths for single men in the bow and berths for single women, married couples and families in the stern. Engineering Although Britannic was rigged as a four masted barque, she was the first White Star ship to sport two funnels. She was powered by inverted compound reciprocating engines, supplied by Messrs Maudslay, Sons & Field of Lambeth. Britannics hull was subdivided into eight watertight compartments by nine watertight bulkheads. Drawing of Britannics engines. As built the Britannic incorporated a novel system which allowed the single propeller to be raised and lowered while still connected to its shaft and without stopping the engine. This was achieved with a flexible coupling and an elongated aperture in the ship's sternpost. This feature was an attempt to overcome the disadvantage of long-hulled single-screw liners, which pitched in heavy seas. In bad weather the stern could rise enough to lift the propeller partially out of the water, reducing thrust and causing unpleasant vibration. The Britannic's adjustable propeller was angled below the horizontal when in the lowest position, to ensure the entire propeller remained submerged. In shallow water the shaft could be raised to the horizontal or slightly upwards to reduce the ship's draught and prevent a blade striking the seabed. With the propeller fully raised the entire propeller hub and one blade could be accessed without placing the ship in dry dock‚Äîit was hoped this would reduce the cost and time required to change any broken propeller blades. The shaft was raised and lowered by a small auxiliar steam engine in the ship's stern, operating rods connected to a bearing collar on the propeller shaft via a worm drive reduction gear. The system proved reliable and effective at its purpose of keeping the propeller submerged in heavy weather but when set at certain angles the flexible coupling caused heavy vibration and the equipment required significantly more maintenance than a standard drive system. It also reduced the efficiency of the propeller in calm weather unless the angle was adjusted to be perfectly parallel to the line of the hull, making Britannic slower than her conventionally-built sistership, the Germanic. In 1875, after less than a year in service, Britannic was taken out of service to be refitted with the same propeller arrangement as her sister - this work required not only removing the propeller mechanism and installing a new drive shaft but also fitting a new bed for the main engine to change its alignment. Once the ship was back in service her performance matched that of the Germanic, allowing the ship to make its own attempts at the Blue Riband. Career On 25 June 1874 she made her maiden voyage, from Liverpool to New York. In the autumn of 1876, she captured the westbound Blue Riband and a month later set the eastbound record as well, becoming the only White Star ship ever to hold both records simultaneously. She lost the westbound record to her sister, Germanic, in April 1877 and the eastbound one to the Guion Line's Arizona in July 1879. On 4 July 1881 Britannic ran aground in fog at Kilmore, County Wexford, Ireland, and remained stuck for two days. All the passengers were safely landed at Waterford. Britannic sprang a leak in her engine room after being re-floated and was beached at Wexford Bay. She had to be patched up and pumped before returning to Liverpool for repairs. SS Celtic collision On 19 May 1887, at about 5:25pm, the White Star liner SS Celtic collided with Britannic in thick fog about east of Sandy Hook, New Jersey. Celtic, with 870 passengers, had been steaming westbound for New York City, while Britannic, carrying 450 passengers, was on the second day of her eastward journey to Liverpool. The two ships collided at almost right angles, with Celtic burying her prow in the aft port side of Britannic. Celtic rebounded and hit two more times, before sliding past behind Britannic. Six steerage passengers were killed outright on board Britannic and another six were later found to be missing, having been washed overboard. There were no deaths on board Celtic. Both ships were badly damaged, but Britannic more so, having a large hole below her waterline. Fearing that she would founder, the passengers on board began to panic and rushed the lifeboats. Britannic's captain, Hugh Hamilton Perry,theshipslist.com pistol in hand, was able to restore some semblance of order, and the boats were filled with women and children, although a few men forced their way on board. After the lifeboats had launched, it was realized that Britannic would be able to stay afloat, and the lifeboats within hailing distance were recalled. The rest made their way over to Celtic. The two ships remained together through the night and the next morning were joined by the Wilson Line's Marengo and British Queen of the Inman Line, and the four slowly made their way into New York Harbor. Britannic was repaired at New York and was out of service for nearly a month.www.greatships.net/britannic Two-and-a- half-year-old Eleanor Roosevelt was on board the Britannic at the time of the collision, with her father Elliott, mother Anna and aunt Tissie. Eleanor was lowered into a lifeboat, screaming and protesting. She and her parents were taken to the Celtic and eventually returned to New York. Eleanor raised a huge protest at the prospect of going back on board a ship to continue the family's trip to Europe. Her parents went on to Europe, leaving the little girl with a maternal aunt. Eleanor had a lifelong fear of water and ships as a result of this incident.Lash, J. (1971). Eleanor and Franklin: The Story of Their Relationship, based on Eleanor Roosevelt's Private Papers. New York: W. W. Norton & Company Czarowitz collision On 2 January 1890, Britannic collided with Czarowitz‚Äîa British brigantine bound from Fowey, Cornwall, England, to Runcorn, Cheshire, England, with a cargo of china clay‚Äîin the Crosby Channel as Czarowitz was about to enter the River Mersey. Czarowitz sank. Later career Britannic continued on the Liverpool-New York run. On one journey in August 1891, the 17-year-old ship recorded her fastest-ever crossing from New York to Queenstown, making the journey in 7 days, 6 hours, and 52 min. In August 1899 Britannic was requisitioned by the Royal Navy and converted for use as a troopship to transport soldiers to the Second Boer War in South Africa, becoming known as HMT (Hired Military Transport) #62. During this period, under the command of Bertram Fox Hayes, Britannic transported 37,000 troops to and from the conflict over three years.News from 1924/1941: Retirement/Death of Commodore Hayes - www.encyclopedia-titanica.org In November 1900 Britannic sailed to Australia with a Guard of Honour to represent Great Britain at the inauguration of the Australian Commonwealth.

Demise Following the end of the war in October 1902, Britannic was released from government service and returned to White Star who sent her to her builders in Belfast for a survey, with the intention that she might be refurbished and modernised for further use. The builders report in 1903 concluded that it would not be cost effective to bring the 29 year old ship up to modern standards, instead, she was sold for scrap for ¬£11,500, and on 11 August 1903 she left Belfast under tow to Hamburg, Germany, where she was broken up.

History In 216 BC, a Roman army under consul Varro camped in the town called Maccla, thought to be this town, prior to marching to the defeat against Hannibal at the Battle of Cannae. In 476 AD with the Western Roman Empire weakening, Maccla was occupied by the Visigoths. In the early Middle Ages it was a possession of the Lombards, who held it until 982, when they were defeated by the Byzantines. On September 21, 1701, Gaetano Giacomo Gambacorta, styled the Prince of Macchia, started a conspiracy (Macchia Conspiracy), against the Spanish viceroy in Naples. The revolt was quickly put down and Gaetano fled to Vienna, Austria where he died on January 27, 1703. In 1800 Joseph Bonaparte, King of Naples and Napoleon's brother, divided Naples into new administrative orders. This created the Province of Campobasso which Macchia is located to this day. The suffix Valfortore was added in the 19th century.

(1998). Review of the Australian stilt flies (Diptera: Micropezidae) with a phylogenetic analysis of the family. Invertebrate Taxonomy 12:55‚Äì134. (with key to Australian species) They are most diverse in tropical and subtropical habitats, especially in the Neotropical Region. Insects in this family are commonly called stilt-legged flies, after their characteristically long legs. The fore legs are markedly smaller than the other pairs. Mostly, they are long-bodied, often black flies, usually with infuscated (darkened) wings. Wings are reduced in the genera Calycopteryx and entirely absent in the ant-like Badisis ambulans. Description For terms see Morphology of Diptera Very slender, small to large (3‚Äì16 mm) flies, they have long, thin legs and narrow wings. The head is small and elongated or rounded. The antennae are small and the arista is bare or pubescent. Ocelli are present, but ocellar bristles are absent. Vibrissae are absent and the postvertical bristles are divergent or absent. Up to three pairs of frontal bristles curve forward or backward. Interfrontal bristles are absent. The wings are clear or have a smoky pattern. The costa is without interruptions. The subcosta is complete, its ending in the costa close to vein R1. The posterior basal wing cell and discoidal wing cell are sometimes fused. Crossvein BM-Cu present or (Micropezinae) absent. The abdomen is long and narrow. The tibiae lack a dorsal preapical bristle. Biology Micropeza corrigiolata Neria cibaria Some species, much the same as in the strongylophthalmyiid genus, Strongylophthalmyia, mimic ants; others mimic wasps and are especially similar in appearance to some ichneumonid wasps. Species of the genus Anaeropsis have stalked eyes. Little is known of the larval habits, but they are probably phytophagous or saprophagous in decayed vegetation, old manure, or fungi . Larvae of certain Mimegralla species have been found to live in the roots of ginger and other plants, under the bark of dead trees, or in other decaying material. Species of Micropeza have phytophagous larvae feeding in the root nodules of leguminous plants in open habitats. Species of Rainieria develop in rotting wood and are found in old forests. Adults are either predatory on small insects (for example Calobata in Britain) or are attracted to excrement or decaying fruit. Adults are found on low herbage, flowers, leaves, rotting fruit, and excrement. Many species (for example those of genus Mimegralla) are known for their habit of standing motionless while waving their prominently marked front legs in front of their heads, a behavior which contributes to their mimicry of wasps. At least one species of Metopochetus (M. curvus) was observed to wave its hind legs instead, though these are not conspicuously colored. Identification *Czerny. 1930. Tylidae. In: Lindner, E. (Ed.).

Conservation Calycopteryx mosleyi, found on the Kerguelen Islands and Heard Island, is associated with the Kergu√©len cabbage (Pringlea antiscorbutica, Brassicaceae). As this plant is being destroyed by introduced rabbits, the fly is considered vulnerable. The larvae of Badisis ambulans live in the pitchers of the endangered Albany pitcher plant (Cephalotus follicularis, Cephalotaceae). Fossil record Several fossil species have been found in Baltic amber, probably from the Late Eocene (about 36 million years old). However, most were washed onto beaches after wearing from Tertiary strata, making their age uncertain. Two fossil genera are presently recognized, Cypselosomatites Hennig, 1965 and the advanced Electrobata Hennig, 1965 which may be more than one genus however.

The point is marked by the Point Hicks Lighthouse that faces the Tasman Sea. The traditional custodians of the land surrounding Point Hicks are the Australian Aboriginal Bidhawal and Gunaikurnai peoples who called the point Tolywiarar. In April 1770 this area became the first land on the east coast of Australia known to have been sighted by Europeans, when reached the continent during the first voyage of James Cook to the Pacific. Name The point is named after Lieutenant Zachary Hicks of the Endeavour who, in April 1770, first saw land presumed to be the east coast of New Holland. History After charting New Zealand during his first voyage of discovery, Cook set a course westwards, intending to strike for Van Diemen's Land (present-day Tasmania) to establish whether or not it formed part of the presumed southern continent. However, he was forced to maintain a more northerly course owing to prevailing gales, and sailed on until 19 April 1770 when land was sighted at 6 a.m. Two hours later Cook made a further observation of land and named it Point Hicks. Cook recorded the event thus: > the Southermost Point of land we had in sight which bore from us W1/4S I > judged to lay in the Latitude of 38¬∞..0' S¬∞ and in the Longitude of > 211¬∞..07' W t from the Meridian of Greenwich. I have named it Point Hicks, > because Lieut t Hicks was the first who discover'd this land. Cook calculated that Van Diemen's Land ought to lie due south of their position, but having found the coastline trending to the south-west, recorded his doubt that this landmass was connected to it. When Cook came to making his chart of Australia's east coast, he drew a point of land which he named Point Hicks and gave its coordinates as 38¬∞0'S and 148¬∞53'E. However, there is no land in this position. The given coordinates lies several miles off-shore, in 50 fathoms of water. Most writers believe that Cook was deceived by a cloudbank or a compass error, or a faulty observation. Margaret Cameron-Ash, however, claims that Cook deliberately falsified his charts and coordinates in order to hide the existence of Bass Strait for reasons of military and colonial policy. Cameron-Ash's claims have been vigorously challenged as lacking in any sound evidence. Nevertheless, it is likely that Cook's \\"Point of land\\" was not today's Point Hicks, and lies somewhat to the South- West.Lipscombe, Trevor (2015) \\"Cook‚Äôs Point Hicks: Error That Just Won‚Äôt Go Away\\" in Cook's Log by the Captain Cook Society, volume 38, number 2, pages 26‚Äì32. Online at, http://www.captaincooksociety.com/home/detail/cook-s-point- hicks-error-that-just-won-t-go-away The plaque on the landward side of the obelisk at Point Hicks, Victoria, Australia. George Bass sailed past the area at the end of 1797, in an open whale-boat and was unable to identify the point. Although Matthew Flinders sailed past the area in 1798‚Äì99 and again in 1802‚Äì03, the coastal area near Point Hicks was always out of Flinders' visual range. Therefore, it did not appear on any of Matthew Flinders' published charts. The name Point Hicks was still being used on mapsMap by The Society for the diffusion of useful knowledge published in 1840 up until 1840, before being replaced and renamed Cape Everard. The first use of the new name has been attributed to hydrographer John Lort Stokes who surveyed the coast in the Beagle in 1843. It is presumed he named it after fellow naval officer James Everard Home. Stokes' maps don't record the name, but many secondary sources attribute its introduction to him. The first known map showing Cape Everard was published by surveyor George Douglas Smythe, made in 1852 and published in 1853. If he coined the name, then according to one theory he may have been referring to William Everard, commissioner of crown lands (though no record of that Everard has been found). The name Cape Everard was then adopted from 1853 up until the early 1900s, until more historical information became readily available. Despite the adopted use of the name Cape Everard to designate the promontory, Cook's original name of Point Hicks was recorded on an obelisk- shaped monument erected by the Australian Government on the site in 1924. The inscription on the landward side of the monument reads: In the 1930s, the Australian business man and philanthropist Russell Grimwade commissioned stone to be quarried from Cape Everard and shipped to Great Ayton in Yorkshire. It was used to create a replica monument with an identical plaque placed at the site of the Cook family home, following Grimwade having the home dismantled and removed to Fitzroy Gardens, Melbourne in 1934. Cook's name, Point Hicks, was officially established as the name of the cape as part of the bicentenary of Cook's 1770 voyage. Victorian Premier Henry Bolte proclaimed the new name in a ceremony at the point on 20 April 1970. Climate Point Hicks has a mild oceanic climate (Cfb) with pleasant summers and cool damp winters.

El Camino Sierra refers to the full length of a trail formed in the 19th century, rebuilt as highways in the early 20th century, that ran from Los Angeles to Lake Tahoe following parts of modern State Route 14, U.S. Route 395 and State Route 89. Two portions of this road are currently signed as Sierra Highway. The first is an old alignment of SR 14/U.S. Route 6 from Los Angeles to Mojave. This road is also signed with the unusual designation of State Route 14U through the city of Santa Clarita. The second part signed as Sierra Highway is a portion of US 395 in Bishop. Traversing the extremes of California, from the Mojave Desert to the Sierra Nevada, El Camino Sierra has been advertised to the world as a highway to showcase the natural beauty of California as far back as 1910. Though most of Sierra Highway was bypassed in the early 1970s with freeways, the road is still well known. The portion through the San Gabriel Mountains is noted as the primary filming location for the film Duel. Route description Sierra Highway in Santa Clarita. Although Route 14 was moved to a freeway bypass years ago, this portion remains under state control in a state of bureaucratic limbo, signed as Route 14 \\"Un- relinquished\\" El Camino Sierra connects Los Angeles with Lake Tahoe along the eastern edge of California, serving the counties of Los Angeles, Kern, Inyo, Mono, Alpine and El Dorado. The highway exists as a roadway now called Sierra Highway from Los Angeles to Mojave. North of Mojave, El Camino Sierra is better known by the numbered designations in current use. While traversing the state, the highway crosses several mountain passes. The highway crests the San Gabriel Mountains via Soledad Pass. While in the Sierra Nevada the highway crosses Sherwin Summit, Deadman Summit, Conway Summit, Devil's Gate Pass, Monitor Pass and Luther Pass. Southern California Sierra Highway begins at Tunnel Station within the northernmost limits of the City of Los Angeles, where it intersects with San Fernando Road. This junction was historically the intersection of U.S. Route 99 and U.S. Route 6. It is located adjacent to the intersection of the replacement freeways, the Newhall Pass interchange of Interstate 5 and State Route 14. The highway serves as one of the main thoroughfares of Santa Clarita. Through the city, Route 14 was moved to a freeway alignment in 1971; however, the process to decommission the old alignment of Route 14 is not complete. As a result, this portion is signed California State Route 14U, the U signifying \\"un-relinquished\\".Additional photos of signs along SR 14U are available at Cameron Kaiser's website in the external links section Formal specifications for Route 14U are not published on Caltrans logs, but the route's existence is acknowledged in Caltrans' bridge inventory logs. According to the City of Santa Clarita, Caltrans maintains Sierra Highway (14U) from 500 feet north of Newhall Avenue to Whispering Leaves Drive. The remaining part of Sierra Highway through the City of Santa Clarita is maintained by the City and not part of the 14U designation. Sierra Highway in the San Gabriel Mountains Sierra Highway, modern Route 14, and a main line of the Union Pacific Railroad all cross the San Gabriel Mountains, cresting the mountains at Soledad Pass (elevation ). The three transportation arteries use different paths up the mountains, separating at Santa Clarita and converging near Acton. Sierra Highway uses Mint Canyon, the railroad uses Soledad Canyon and the modern Route 14 is a hybrid route using the ridges and side canyons between the two older routes. These canyons are formed by the Santa Clara River and its tributaries. Upon exiting the mountains, Sierra Highway enters the Antelope Valley and serves as one of the main streets of Palmdale, Lancaster, and Rosamond. The highway runs parallel to the modern Route 14 and the railroad, becoming a frontage road. Just shy of Mojave the freeway portion of Route 14 ends, while the frontage road becomes a dirt path and eventually terminates. From this point, the canonical route of Sierra Highway joins State Route 14, passing through downtown Mojave. U.S. Route 395 and State Route 89 Southbound US 395 cresting Deadman Summit with Mount Morrison in the distance North of Mojave the alignments of State Routes 14 and 89, and U.S. Route 395 have not significantly changed since first paved, and are called El Camino Sierra. Significant portions have been upgraded to a divided highway; however, most of the upgrades used the same alignment as the old two lane road. The highway cuts across Red Rock Canyon State Park to follow a series of valleys along the crest of the Sierra Nevada. While traversing the Owens Valley, the Sierra Highway passes Mount Whitney, the highest point in the contiguous United States, above the highway. As of 2009, the only other signed section of Sierra Highway is a portion of U.S. 395 past the separation with U.S. 6 in Bishop. U.S. 395 was rebuilt on a new alignment on the ascent to Sherwin Summit and around Crowley Lake. Unlike the highway relocation in southern California, the old alignments have been renamed, now called Lower Rock Creek Road, Old Sherwin Grade, and Crowley Creek Road; not Sierra Highway. From here to Lake Tahoe, the highway crosses mountainous terrain inside the Sierra Nevada, giving the highway its name. While in the Sierra Nevada, the road passes by attractions such as Mammoth Mountain, Yosemite National Park and Mono Lake. El Camino Sierra separates from U.S. 395, just prior to the Nevada state line at Topaz Lake, following SR 89\\\\. This is the only portion of the route not used year-round, as Caltrans closes Route 89 over Monitor Pass during winter months. Motorists destined for Lake Tahoe during the winter closures can continue along US 395 into Nevada, and return to California via Nevada State Route 88 or Nevada State Route 207. History=El Camino Sierra 1918, Lancaster, California. Looking south on Sierra Highway, at the intersection with Lancaster Boulevard. Historic Route 6 sign along Sierra Hwy. The first recorded journey along what would become El Camino Sierra was by Jedediah Smith in 1826. The trail was in common use by prospectors passing through the area because of the California Gold Rush and Comstock Lode. While still mostly a dirt road, several people began promoting El Camino Sierra as a scenic route. In 1910, the Los Angeles Times announced that Governor Gillet had announced funding to construct a new road to connect El Camino Real with Yosemite National Park. When finished, a new \\"wonderful circuit\\" route would be complete and El Camino Sierra would become \\"one of the most beautiful scenic routes in the world.\\" In 1912, the Southern Pacific Railroad published an article called \\"Two Mules and a Motorist\\" in which the author's trip down El Camino Sierra was detailed, promoting the trail as a scenic side trip, via pack mules, from its rail lines. In 1915, the California Teachers Association distributed a promotional book to the annual convention of the National Education Association. This book contained an article that sung the praises of this \\"soon-to-be-world-famous highway\\" called El Camino Sierra. While noting that it was still mostly an unimproved trail, the article assured the readers that county and state officials were working frantically to upgrade the route and, with the aid of convict labor, this would soon be a \\"boulevard the entire distance from Los Angeles to Lake Tahoe.\\" The article concluded by stating El Camino Sierra was \\"a highway with a hundred by-ways, each by-way with a hundred wonders\\". The article also implored the state legislature to extend El Camino Sierra to Truckee, Quincy and Susanville using a route similar to modern State Route 89, SR 70 returning to US 395. By 1918, El Camino Sierra had been included in the Blue Book, an early road atlas of the United States. The Los Angeles Times declared El Camino Sierra complete on Feb 19, 1931, announcing that the portion from Mojave to Owens Valley was now paved, and would be dedicated the following Sunday. Sierra Highway During the 1930s, two U.S. highways, both formed in 1926, were extended into California using El Camino Sierra. The southern terminus of U.S. 395 was extended from Spokane, Washington to San Diego, using El Camino Sierra from near what is now Topaz Lake to Inyokern, by 1935. By 1937, U.S. Route 6 was extended from Colorado, mostly along the Midland Trail, to Long Beach using El Camino Sierra south of Bishop. As part of the 1964 state highway renumbering US 6 was truncated at Bishop, and the route from the separation with US 395 to I-5 was renumbered SR 14. Though during the 1970s most of Sierra Highway was bypassed by freeways and expressways, the old two-lane road remained a famous roadway. In 1971, Steven Spielberg made his first feature-length film, Duel, along Sierra Highway, near Acton. The film is about an unseen truck driver who stalks and attempts to kill an innocent motorist trapped in the truck's game. It prominently shows the desert portions of Sierra Highway. With Duel's status, one of the trucks used in the film is still on the road and in the process of being restored. The current owner has driven the truck along Sierra Highway for nostalgia, enjoying the terrified looks he receives from passing motorists who recognize it.

George S. McGill (February 12, 1879May 14, 1963) was an American politician who served as a United States Senator from Kansas from 1930 to 1939. He was a member of the Democratic Party. Biography Born in Lucas County, Iowa, he moved with his parents to Kansas when he was 5. He graduated from Central Normal College in Great Bend, Kansas at the turn of the century and was admitted to the state bar two years later. McGill then moved to Wichita, Kansas where he was made Deputy County Attorney and then County Attorney for Sedgwick County, Kansas. He was elected to the United States Senate on November 4, 1930 to replace Charles Curtis, who resigned to become Vice President of the United States. Former Governor Henry J. Allen was appointed to fill the seat until a successor was elected. In the Senate, he was the Chairman of the Committee on Pensions and was particularly involved in the Agricultural Adjustment Act. He was reelected in 1932 but lost reelection bids in 1938, 1942, 1948 and 1954. McGill was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as a member of the U.S. Tariff Commission, a post he held until 1954. He died in St. Francis Hospital in Wichita in 1963 and was buried in Pawnee Rock Cemetery, in Pawnee Rock, Kansas. Kansas has elected only three Democratic U.S. Senators; McGill is the only one of the three both to be elected by popular vote (as opposed to election by the State Legislature) and to serve more than one 6-year term, the others being John Martin and William Thompson. , McGill is the last Democrat to serve in the U.S. Senate from Kansas; the state has been exclusively represented in the Senate by Republicans since 1939, the longest such active streak for either party in the country.

Early life Sherman W. McMaster was born in 1853 in Rock Island, Illinois, the son of Sylvester W. McMaster. Not much is known of his life before heading out west, but he moved to Texas and became a Texas Ranger. He met \\"Curly Bill\\" Brocius, who was a prisoner under McMaster's Ranger division. In 1878 Curly Bill escaped from prison, allegedly helped by McMaster. Soon after, along with Brocius, Johnny Barnes, and Pony Diehl, McMaster moved to Arkansas.  Life as an outlaw and gunfighter  McMaster worked for the Texas Rangers in 1878, the same year that he first met Brocius. By most accounts he was a good lawman, and was respected for his talents with a gun. In July 1880 he was suspected of stealing U.S. Army mules and two horses from a camp near Tombstone. He was also a suspect in a stagecoach robbery near Globe, Arizona. On February 24, 1881, two men robbed the stage traveling between Globe and Florence. When they found that the Wells, Fargo & Co. strongbox was empty, they stole the U.S. mail. Pony Diehl (aka Charles Ray) and McMaster were suspects. In Tombstone, City Marshal Virgil Earp knew that McMaster was wanted for the robbery, but according to The Tombstone Epitaph Virgil had received instructions from Pima County Sheriff Bob Paul to wait to arrest McMaster until Diehl was in custody. On September 10, 1881, Tombstone City Marshal Virgil Earp attempted to arrest McMaster, who resisted. McMaster fired several shots at Virgil before escaping. Some accounts have since indicated he was possibly working undercover for the Rangers to break up the outlaw Cowboys. By the time the clash between the Earps and the Cowboys came about, McMaster's allegiance was with the Earps. He played an important role in the vendetta. Once a member of the Cowboys (an outlaw gang), he later changed his views and sided with the Earps. He had, by all accounts, previously met and become friends with Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday in Dodge City, Kansas. He assisted Wyatt Earp in taking his revenge on the outlaw gang for the death of Wyatt's brother, Morgan Earp, and the shooting of his other brother Virgil Earp, all following the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Among the other participants in the Vendetta were Wyatt and his younger brother Warren Earp, Doc Holliday, \\"Turkey Creek\\" Jack Johnson, and Texas Jack Vermillion. Death In a letter written to his father, Will McLaury wrote that McMaster had been killed by the Cowboys. Wyatt Earp claimed in the Flood manuscript that McMaster had been killed in 1898 in the Philippines while serving as a soldier in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. However, official records do not list him as a soldier. A probate record filed by his siblings in 1906 listed his death in Colorado in 1892. In popular culture McMaster has been portrayed in almost every film about the Earps. He was most notably portrayed by actor Michael Rooker in the 1993 film Tombstone, in which he is called \\"McMasters\\". In that film, he is portrayed as being killed by the Cowboys during the Vendetta, although that is historically inaccurate. ReferencesFurther reading *Sherman McMasters.

These include systems of transliteration, and transcription. The most seen system in public space is Royal Thai General System of Transcription (RTGS)‚Äîthe official scheme promulgated by the Royal Thai Institute. It is based on spoken Thai, but disregards tone, vowel length and a few minor sound distinctions. The international standard ISO 11940 is a transliteration system, preserving all aspects of written Thai adding diacritics to the Roman letters. Its extension ISO 11940-2 defines a simplified transcription reflecting the spoken language. It is almost identical to RTGS. Libraries in English-speaking countries use the ALA-LC Romanization. In practice, often non-standard and inconsistent romanizations are used, especially for proper nouns and personal names. This is reflected, for example, in the name Suvarnabhumi Airport, which is spelled based on direct transliteration of the name's Sanskrit root. Language learning books often use their own proprietary systems, none of which are used in Thai public space. Transliteration An international standard, ISO 11940, was devised with transliteration in academic context as one of its main goals. It is based on Thai orthography, and defines a reversible transliteration by means of adding a host of diacritics to the Latin letters. The result bears little resemblance to the pronunciation of the words and is hardly ever seen in public space. Some scholars use the C≈ìd√®s system for Thai transliteration defined by Georges C≈ìd√®s, in the version published by his student Uraisi Varasarin. In this system, the same transliteration is proposed for Thai and Khmer whenever possible. Transcription The Royal Thai System of Transcription, usually referred to as RTGS uses only unadorned roman letters to reflect spoken Thai. It does not indicate tone and vowel length. Furthermore it merges IPA /o/ and /…î/ into and IPA /…ï/ and /t…ï/ into . This system is widely used in Thailand, especially for road signs. The ISO standard ISO 11940-2 defines a set of rules to transform the result of ISO 11940 into a simplified transcription. In the process, it rearranges the letters to correspond to Thai pronunciation, but it discards information about vowel length and syllable tone and the distinction between IPA /o/ and /…î/. These are not reversible, as they do not indicate tone and underrepresent vowel quality and quantity. Graphemic distinctions between letters for Indic voiced, voiceless, and breathy-voiced consonants have also been neutralised. History=American missionary romanization In 1842, Mission Press in Bangkok published two pamphlets on transliteration: One for transcribing Greek and Hebrew names into Thai, and the other, \\"A plan for Romanising the Siamese Language\\". The principle underlying the transcription scheme was phonetic, i.e. it represented pronunciation, rather than etymology, but also maintained some of the features of Thai orthography. Several diacritics were used: The acute accent was used to indicate long vowels, where Thai script had two different vowel signs for the vowel sounds: ‡∏≠‡∏¥ was transliterated as i, while ‡∏≠‡∏µ was transliterated as √≠. The exception to this rule was the signs for […Ø]: ‡∏≠‡∏∂ was transliterated as ≈≠, while ‡∏≠‡∏∑ was transliterated as √º. The various signs for […§], were transliterated as √´. The grave accent was used to indicate other vowels: […î] was transliterated as √≤, while […õ] became √®. ‡∏∞ was transliterated with a hyphen, so that ‡∏Å‡∏∞ became ka-, and ‡πÅ‡∏Å‡∏∞ became k√®-. Aspirated consonants were indicated by the use of an apostrophe: ‡∏ö b [b], ‡∏õ p [p] and ‡∏û p‚Äô [p ∞]. This included separating the affricates ‡∏à ch [tÕ°…ï] and ‡∏ä ch‚Äô [tÕ°…ï ∞]. Proposed system by the Siamese society For many years, the Siam Society was discussing a uniform way in which to transliterate Thai using Latin script. Numerous schemes were created by its individual members and published in its journal, including one tentative scheme by King Rama VI, published in 1913. The same year, the society published a proposal for \\"transliterating Siamese words\\", which had been designed by several of its members working together. The system was dual, in that it separated Sanskrit and Pali loans, which were to be transliterated accordiding to the Hunterian system, however, an exception was made for those words which had become so integrated into Thai that their Sanskrit and Pali roots had been forgotten. For proper Thai words, the system is somewhat similar to the present RTGS, for instance with regards to the differentiation of consonants' initial and final sounds. Some of the major differences are: *Aspiration would be marked with spiritus asper placed after the consonant, so that ‡∏Ç and ‡∏Ñ would both be transliterated as k·øæ (whereas RTGS transliterates them as kh). *Long vowels were indicated by adding a macron to the corresponding sign for the short vowel. *The vowels ‡∏≠‡∏∂ and ‡∏≠‡∏∑ ([…Ø] and […ØÀê]) would be transliterated using an umlauted u, respectively √º and «ñ (the macron is placed above the umlaut). *The vowel ‡πÅ‡∏≠ would be transliterated as √´, whereas RTGS transliterates it as ae. *When ‡∏∞ indicates a shortened vowel, it would be indicated with the letter ·∏•, so that ‡πÅ‡∏≠‡∏∞ would be transliterated as √´·∏•. *The vowel ‡∏≠‡∏≠ […îÀê], would be distinguished from ‡πÇ‡∏≠ with a superscript v: «í. Its corresponding short form ‡πÄ‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏∞ […î], would be transliterated as «í·∏•. *The vowel ‡πÄ‡∏≠‡∏≠ would be transliterated as √∂. As the system was meant to provide an easy reference for the European who was not familiar with the Thai language, the system aimed at only using a single symbol to represent each distinct sound. Similarly, tones were not marked, as it was felt that the \\"learned speaker\\" would be so familiar with the Thai script, as to not need a transliteration scheme to find the proper pronunciation. King Vajiravudh, however, was not pleased with the system, contending that when different consonants were used in the final position, it was because they represented different sounds, such that a final -‡∏• would, by an educated speaker, be pronounced differently from a final -‡∏ô. He also opposed using a phonetic Thai spelling for any word of Sanskrit or Pali origin, arguing that these should be transliterated in their Indic forms, so as to preserve their etymology. While most of Vajiravudh's criticisms focused on the needs and abilities of learned readers, he argued against the use of spiritus asper to indicate aspiration, as it would mean \\"absolutely nothing to the lay reader\\".

It was rented for a short number of years in the early 1960s as an architects office for the team who built the 60s part of Livingston, Scotland. Later it was used as a hotel and restaurant and \\"mediaeval banqueting hall\\", the last use being tenuously linked with William Finnemund, the 12th century, Laird of Cambusnethan. There was originally a Norman tower house near the site of the present building, and this was replaced by a manor house during the 17th century.

He was the son of Negus Sahle Selassie of Shewa and half-brother to Negus Haile Melekot, and the uncle of Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia. Captured by Emperor Tewodros II during that Emperor's reincorporation of Shewa into the Ethiopian Empire in 1855, Darge and his nephew Menelik II (then called Sahle Maryam) were the chief Shewan prisoners taken with the Emperor to Gondar, and later the mountain citadel at Magdala (the modern Amba Mariam). Abeto Darge as he was then called, had been among the Shewan leaders that had tried to rally the resistance against the Emperor in the name of the young prince his nephew, and Tewodros had admired Darge's efforts. Although technically prisoners, the two Shewan princes enjoyed the Emperor's affection and favor, and were greatly honored and respected at his court. Darge was especially admired for his military skills. When Emperor Tewodros eventually decided to marry his daughter Alitash Tewodros to Menelik, Darge (now titled a Fitawrari) presided as the family elder of the Shewan Royal House. Bridge built under Ras Darge's rule as governor of Shewa near Debre Libanos Darge was part of the Shewan party that helped Menelik escape from Magdala in order to return to Shewa and reclaim his throne, but he himself remained behind. Darge was not punished by Tewodros for helping Menelik escape, and this was attributed to the deep affection Tewodros II had for Darge. He was released from captivity in 1868 by the British. Darge was created a Ras and made Ras of Selale by his nephew upon his return to Shewa following his release from Magdala when Tewodros II died, founding the senior cadet branch of the dynasty in the later days of the Ethiopian Empire. In 1886, then Emperor Menelik assigned him the governorship of Arsi Province, and completed the conquest that his nephew had begun the year before.Marcus, Menelik II, p. 89 The conquest was infamous for its slaughter of the Arsi Oromo who lived there, leading Baxter to describe him as \\"the Butcher Cumberland of the Arussi Highlands... whose name is still reviled there.\\"P. T. W. Baxter, \\"Ethiopia's Unacknowledged Problem: The Oromo\\", African Affairs, Vol. 77 (July, 1978), p. 291 Darge became Menelik's senior advisor, always advising him to be prudent and patient in his dealings with the powers that be. Although Menelik claimed to be the next legitimate claimant to the Imperial throne, Darge brokered Menelik's acceptance of Wagshum Gobeze's assumption of the throne as Tekle Giyorgis II and the marriage of his own daughter Tisseme to the new Emperor's half-brother Haile Wolde Kiros. When Tekle Giyorgis II was deposed by Emperor Yohannes IV, again it was Darge who counseled Menelik to be patient and submit. As a result, Darge was universally respected by all the various feudal princelings and claimants in Ethiopia, and was held in very high regard by Emperor Yohannes in particular. Considered the senior prince of the blood during the reign of his nephew as Emperor Menelik II, he was the only person in a position to scold the Emperor as a father would. He often acted as regent in the absence of Emperor Menelik. He was acting in the capacity when the Emperor was marching north to face the Italians at Adowa, when he received the stunning news that the Italians had brought his son Lij Gugsa Darge from his school in Switzerland with the intention of placing him on the imperial throne after they defeated Menelik. Ras Darge was enraged, and not only disowned his son but had his name struck from the Imperial family genealogy. Ras Darge died a few years after that battle.Marcus, Menelik II, p. 215 He was the father of Dejazmach Desta Darge, Woizero Tisseme Darge, Fitawrari Shewareged Darge, Dejazmach Tessema Darge, Woizero Tsehaywork Darge, Woizero Askale Darge, Dejazmach Asfaw Darge, Lij Gugsa Darge and Lij Belw DargeBilaten Geta Mahiteme Silase Welde Meskel, page 21 from the book of the great family tree of King Sahile Silase The succession to Selale eventually passed on to his grandson Ras Kassa Haile Darge, son of Woizero Tisseme Darge.

Brooks portrays a novelist who moves back home with his mother after his second divorce, hoping to determine why all his relationships with women were unsuccessful. Mother was Reynolds's first major film role in over 20 years. The film earned positive reviews and was Brooks's most financially successful film as a director. Plot John Henderson (Albert Brooks) is a successful science fiction writer who is finalizing his second divorce. He is perplexed by the issues he has with women, realizing that none of them supported or encouraged him. John decides to initiate an experiment that will help him understand what went wrong in his relationships: he moves back in with his widowed mother Beatrice (Debbie Reynolds), occupying the same bedroom he had as a child. His sports agent brother Jeff thinks John is oversensitive to their mother's criticisms, while John believes that their mother favors Jeff. John's relationship with his mother is characterized by constant bickering and power struggles; both are perfectionists strongly committed to their respective points of view. John believes she's overly critical of him, while Beatrice contends that he unfairly blames her for his personal failings. A rare bright spot in their relationship appears when she takes an interest in John's word processor and impresses him with her fast, flawless typing. Beatrice seems surprised by his interest in her life but is reluctant to discuss it. When Beatrice cancels her plans to visit Jeff, he has a meltdown and an argument with his wife over his need to keep in constant contact with his mother. Jeff's wife tells him that he may need to evaluate his relationship with his mother just as much as John. John and Beatrice go to the zoo, where they finally reach some common ground. When they return home, Jeff is waiting; upset by the aborted visit, he came to talk Beatrice into visiting for the weekend. All three argue and Jeff leaves alone, with John satisfied that Jeff's the \\"sickie\\" while John is \\"pretty darn healthy to begin with.\\" Beatrice tells John that she has a friend, Charles, who comes through San Francisco every few weeks and stays over a few days, but while John is there this visit will be just for one day. John is surprised that she would call someone she is intimate with not important, but she dismisses it, saying they \\"just have sex occasionally\\". John meets Charles, who knows a lot about John because, as he tells John, Beatrice brags about him when he's not around. Beatrice and Charles go to dinner; in the car they discuss the evening, with Beatrice refusing to have anything more than dinner because of her son's visit. While alone at the house, John discovers a box of novel and short story manuscripts that his mother wrote in her youth. He learns she was a skilled writer who went to college on a scholarship, only to have her talent discouraged by her husband and the prevailing social expectation that mothers should not have careers outside the home. John realizes now that his mother's passive aggression toward him stems from the fact that his career is a reminder of her unfulfilled ambitions. Beatrice admits that John's observation is correct, leading to a warm reconciliation. The film ends with John meeting a single female fan of his novels, and Beatrice beginning to write a story based on John's moving in with her.

Day turned down the offer; Reagan loved the script, and considered coming out of retirement for her first acting role in more than 40 years, but decided instead to stay home and care for her husband Ronald Reagan, who was suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Brooks then asked his good friend Carrie Fisher if she could send the script to her mother Debbie Reynolds, who accepted the part. Reynolds hadn't had a starring role since the late 1960s. Mother was filmed on location in and around the Sausalito, Greenbrae, and Tiburon, California areas, with additional shooting in San Francisco. The exterior of Beatrice's house and street was shot in Studio City. Reception=Critical reception Mother received mostly positive reviews from critics, and holds an 88% \\"Fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 41 reviews. The site's consensus states \\"Albert Brooks' pugnacious insight is in fine form throughout Mother, a gentle showcase for the comedic curmudgeon and a sweetly acidic Debbie Reynolds.\\" Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times gave Mother 3.5 stars out of a possible 4, writing that while the premise seemed like the setup for a cheap sitcom, Brooks \\"is much too smart to settle for the obvious gags and payoffs...the dialogue in Mother is written so carefully that some lines carry two or three nuances.\\" The audience laughter wasn't a reaction to obvious punchlines, wrote Ebert, \\"but the laughter of recognition, of insight, even sometimes of squirmy discomfort, as the truths hit close to home\\". Box office Mother remains Brooks' highest-grossing directorial effort to date, earning $19.1 million at the box office. Accolades Mother won the most awards of the films which Brooks has directed. Brooks and co-writer Monica Johnson won the New York Film Critics Circle Award and the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Screenplay. Debbie Reynolds won a Golden Satellite Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical, and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.

It is very similar to sobrassada from the Balearic Islands in Spain. It is typically made with parts of the pig such as the shoulder and belly, as well as tripe, roasted peppers and a mixture of spices. It is a Calabrese variation of salumi, loosely based on the French andouille introduced in the 13th century by the Angevins. 'Nduja is made using meat from the head (minus the jowls, which are used for guanciale), trimmings from various meat cuts, some clean skin, fatback, and roasted hot red peppers which give 'nduja its characteristic fiery taste. 'Nduja originates from the small southern Calabrese town of Spilinga and its neighborhood. It is mainly served with slices of bread or with ripe cheese. Its unique taste makes it suitable for a variety of dishes. For example, it can be added to pasta sauces. 'Nduja's popularity boomed around 2015‚Äì2016 in the US and the UK, and it was featured in dishes at restaurants including New York City's Spotted Pig and London's Temple and Sons.

Constructed from 1902 to 1904 during a period of great growth for the town, the theatre is located on the corner of Hay Street and King Street in Perth's central business district. At the time the theatre was opened, it was the largest theatre in Australia, and had seating for over 2,500 people. It is also thought to be the first reinforced concrete building constructed in Perth. Over its life, the theatre has hosted large-scale musicals, ballet, opera, Shakespearean plays and many other events. It has been renovated numerous times, most notably in the late 1970s when the State Government purchased it and performed an ornamental restoration whilst modernising the facilities provided. Since that time, it has been the home of the West Australian Ballet and West Australian Opera companies, both of which perform regularly. The importance of His Majesty's Theatre to the cultural fabric of Western Australia has been recognised by its inclusion on the State Register of Heritage Places and the Register of the National Estate. It has also been named a \\"State Heritage Icon\\", and is believed to be the only remaining working Edwardian theatre in Australia. Construction At the turn of the 20th century, Perth was experiencing a period of high growth as a result of the Western Australian gold rush. The prosperity which resulted from this boom led to the construction of increasingly opulent baroque buildings. Local politician Thomas Molloy had commissioned the Metropole Hotel in 1896 and adjoining 1200-seat Theatre Royal in 1897,Hough, p. 65 which included the first fully equipped theatre in the growing town.Gervas, p. 44 Soon after the completion of that complex, Molloy asked the same architect, William G. Wolf, to design an integrated theatre and hotel complex to be named His Majesty's Theatre and HotelGervas, p. 45 in honour of the recently crowned King Edward VII. The site selected for this new theatre was the corner of King Street and Hay Street, which in 1896 had been home to \\"Ye Olde Englishe Faire\\". In June 1902, Molloy applied to the Perth Licensing Court for planning permission to construct the theatre, and when he finally received permission, he promised completion within a year.Hough, p. 73 His Majesty's Theatre in the late stages of construction in 1904, showing the original balconies which lined the street frontages A call for tenders to construct the complex was put out, and the winning tender was by Friederich Wilhelm Gustav Liebe, an immigrant from Saxony who had previously constructed the Bulgarian Houses of Parliament in Sofia and worked on the Budapest Opera House.Gervas, pp. 15-16, 45 The tender price was ¬£46,000, of which ¬£43,000 was the cost of the building alone. The construction contract between Molloy and Liebe was signed in November 1902, and Heinrich Schmidt was appointed as foreman for Liebe.Hough, p. 63 Deep excavation of the site for the building's foundations and basement started almost immediately.Hough, p. 75 During construction, questions were publicly raised about the stability of the building's foundations in light of the water table on the site and the presence of a subterranean stream. Liebe conferred with the architect and engineers before developing a revised design which featured drains to divert running water. Liebe presented the modified plans to Molloy and proceeded with them, assuming that he had the consent of Molloy.Gervas, pp. 45-46 Construction progressed, and the building was completed on schedule.Gervas, p. 48 When the time finally came for Molloy to pay Liebe for the construction, a dispute arose as to who should be liable for the extra ¬£17,000 incurred in remedying the structural defect.Gervas, pp. 49-54 Molloy was reputed to be one of the most litigious businessmen in Perth, and refused to pay higher than the original agreed price, on the basis that the contract required his written approval for extra work to be carried out.Hough, p. 76 Liebe pursued him through the courts all the way to the High Court and Privy Council. The Privy Council eventually ruled in favour of Liebe, however the legal costs he had incurred were exorbitant. After resolving some last-minute objections by the Central Board of Health to the building's fire safety,Hough, p. 62 the theatre was officially opened at 8pm on Christmas Eve in 1904 by Sylvia Forrest in the presence of her uncle, former Premier John Forrest. Opening night saw \\"Pollard's Adult Opera Company\\" performing The Forty Thieves, however the choice of opening date was an unfortunate one and the opening night was not a sell-out. Architecture At the time of its opening, His Majesty's Theatre was the largest theatre in Australia, and also featured the country's largest stage and highest fly tower.Hough, p. 87 The complex was constructed with reinforced concrete, and was the first reinforced concrete building in Perth and, possibly, in Australia.Hough, p. 78 The structure is 4-storeys tall, and its features were influenced by 19th-century English and European theatres. It has been described as \\"a fine example\\" of Federation Free Classical or Edwardian Baroque architecture. view of the auditorium from the gallery view of the stage from the upper gallery The building as designed by Wolfe was grander than Molloy's Theatre Royal complex, and featured a 65-room hotel separated from the theatre by internal iron doors. The hotel had billiard rooms, parlours and six bars to serve the patrons of the theatre. The building used of iron and steel, 3.75 million locally made bricks, imported marble, Minton tiles and Castlemaine slate. An electric lift led to the roof, where an observation platform had panoramic views over the town. A 1933 audience in the theatre The auditorium contained a proscenium arch, with a raked stage in size. The auditorium measured , and its original capacity was 2584 people in three tiers. The interior of the theatre was a typical Edwardian horseshoe- shape to bring the audience closer to the performers. It featured stalls (seating 974), a dress circle (seating 540), an upper gallery (seating 1,074) and private boxes. The theatre incorporated several cooling features. Four small waterfalls were located on either side of the proscenium arch, intended to cool the audience in tandem with electric fans and a retractable dome in the ceiling.Gervas, p. 49 The dome was split down the middle, with each half sliding to either side to open. The dome was decorated in imitation of an umbrella, with panels of gold and silver with scrollwork embellishment. The artificial waterfalls were removed early in the life of the theatre. The exterior of the theatre was originally lined with two-level verandah balconies, which provided relief to the imposing walls. These were removed in 1947-48, because authorities considered that the proximity of the supporting pillars to the road constituted a traffic hazard. As a result, there is a disparity between the ornamentation at the top of the building's facade and the lower three storeys, which were previously obscured by the balconies. Subsequent history and renovation Over its first 70 years of life, His Majesty's played host to the traditional Shakespearean plays, opera, political rallies, boxing matches and movie screenings. It was particularly noted for its excellent acoustics.Hough, p. 89 During World War II, the theatre functioned chiefly as a cinema due to travel restrictions on touring companies. Original proprietor Thomas Molloy leased the theatre to others, including Ben and John Fuller, and local producer Anita Fitzgerald.Hough, p. 86 Another lessee of the theatre, J.C. Williamson Ltd, is said to have made His Majesty's Theatre the Perth home of musical theatre. The theatre was renovated in 1912 at a cost of ¬£9,000, and again in 1948 at a cost of ¬£11,000.Hough, p. 34 The latter renovation included new backstage electrical fittings and may also have been the time the verandah balconies were removed from the street frontage of the theatre. In 1952, the theatre was leased by the Edgley family and used for \\"Russian spectaculars\\". The theatre was redecorated for Edgley and Dawe in 1960, this time at a cost of ¬£7,000.Hough, pp. 34-38 Edgley went on to purchase His Majesty's in 1969. After the Perth Entertainment Centre was completed in 1974, the Edgley productions shifted there, and the newly completed Perth Concert Hall was also favoured as a performance venue due to outdated equipment and general disrepair at His Majesty's. The theatre was sold in 1976 to Sir Norman Rydge. Following several years with an uncertain future and a public campaign to save it, in 1977 the theatre was bought by the Government of Western Australia. Adhering to an April 1974 election promise to retain and restore the theatre in conjunction with a new Art Gallery and Cultural Centre, in 1977 the Charles Court Coalition Government undertook a A$10.5 million refurbishment.Hough, p. 30 The final performance in the theatre before closing for renovation was the Gilbert and Sullivan Society's 25th anniversary production of Iolanthe.Hough, p. 85 The refurbishment took three years and was overseen by architects Hill and Parkinson.Hough, pp. 30-34 The refurbishment saw significant structural changes made to the hotel/theatre complex. Initially, it was suggested that the theatre be largely remodelled to a two-tier concert hall design.Hough, p. 38 However, architect Peter S. Parkinson resisted this push to fundamentally alter the design of the theatre and a sympathetic restoration was instead favoured. Within the auditorium, it was found that the reinforced concrete floor of the stalls was substandard and was completely replaced.Hough, p. 34 Additionally, on one of the upper levels a wall was discovered which was not supported by a beam in accordance with the building plans. The much-maligned supporting pillars were shifted back to improve sight-lines for the audience. The raked stage was replaced with a new flat one, and the proscenium arch widened by and decorated with plaster mouldings of the original arch. The pressed-metal ceiling was also replaced with a plaster-moulded copy. The sliding dome in the roof was permanently sealed, and redecorated to match its original design from 1904. The orchestra pit was also expanded and new lighting and counterweights installed. The hotel portion of the complex was separated from the theatre, and renovated to provide a home for the resident West Australian Opera and West Australian Ballet, as well as backstage facilities for touring companies. A separate building was constructed to the rear of the theatre to house new dressing and rehearsal rooms, as well as a new air conditioning system. The theatre's grand marble staircase was relocated to provide a larger foyer. It had its marble treads replaced but retains the original balustrade. The former Sportsman's Bar of the hotel was converted to function as the theatre's new box office, and the side entrance from King Street was made an emergency exit. Soundproofing was also installed within the building's walls to reduce traffic noise. During the renovation there was debate about the best way to manage the theatre in the future.Hough, pp. 45-49 The favoured option was to establish a trust to operate it, which could focus on best serving the arts rather than worrying about commercial viability of productions. However, on 8 February 1979, Premier Court announced that His Majesty's would be run by TVW Enterprises Ltd, the owner of the rival Perth Entertainment Centre. This led to public outcry over potential conflicts of interest, and in June 1979 TVW declined to manage the theatre. The Perth Theatre Trust was instead created, and it took over the running of the theatre. His Majesty's Theatre finally reopened on 28 May 1980, with a reduced seating capacity of 1250. His Majesty's Theatre has long been recognised as an important piece of Western Australia's history: in 1978 it was entered onto the Register of the National Estate. On 8 April 1994, it was included as an interim entry on the Western Australian Register of Heritage Places, before receiving a permanent entry on 16 December 1994. The theatre was named a State Heritage Icon in December 2004, and since February 2001 has housed a Museum of Performing Arts. In 2004 the theatre celebrated its centenary and events included the publications of David Hough's volume of history. In 2006 the theatre became 'twinned' with the only other remaining theatre of the same name in the world, His Majesty's Theatre in Aberdeen, Scotland. Perth's His Majesty's Theatre is believed to be the only remaining working Edwardian theatre in Australia, and is presently managed on behalf of the Perth Theatre Trust by AEG Ogden, which also manages the Perth Concert Hall. In 2008, Savcor (a company which specialises in restoration techniques for concrete and steel) was contracted to do a detailed survey of His Majesty's Theatre. This survey revealed a number of defects on the facades that potentially rendered it unsafe. In 2010, a project involving the restoration of damaged cornices and corbels was carried out. Damaged decorations were replaced by using modern repair mortars which produced perfect reproductions. Mick Summers was in charge of crafting the ornate flowers around the fa√ßade. This was achieved with the help of latex moulds which were taken from the original form. Due to structural deterioration, many of the balconies had to be rebuilt completely. The balconies' many features, including clamshell base, curved profile and plaster features, required many different processes to recreate the original. Both latex moulding and traditional construction techniques were used to make sure the balconies remained durable. Notable performances In addition to being home to the West Australian Opera and the West Australian Ballet, His Majesty's Theatre has hosted famous performers over the years, including:Hough, p. 208 * Edouard Borovansky - Czech-Australian ballet dancer, brought his \\"Borovansky Ballet Company\\" to Perth five times between 1945 and 1960; * Claudette Colbert - French-born American actress; * Peter Cook - English comedian, toured with Dudley Moore; * Dame Margot Fonteyn - English ballerina; * Amelita Galli-Curci - Italian coloratura soprano; * Judy Garland - American actress and singer, visited in 1964; * Sir John Gielgud - English actor and singer; * Percy Grainger - Australian-born pianist and composer; * Sir Rex Harrison - English actor; * Sir Robert Helpmann - Australian actor and dancer, starred with Katharine Hepburn in three Shakespeare plays in 1955; * Katharine Hepburn - American actress, starred with Sir Robert Helpmann in three Shakespeare plays in 1955; * Barry Humphries - Australian comedian and character actor, best known for his character Dame Edna Everage; * Harry Lauder - Scottish entertainer, performed in 1923; * Vivien Leigh - English actress, starred in Twelfth Night by the Old Vic Company in 1962; * Dame Nellie Melba - Australian soprano; * Gladys Moncrieff - Australian singer and musical theatre actress; * Dudley Moore - English actor and comedian, toured with Peter Cook; * Anna Pavlova - Russian ballerina; * Geoffrey Rush - Australian actor; * Dame Maggie Smith - English actress; * Dame Sybil Thorndike - English actress; and * Emlyn Williams - Welsh actor, starred as Charles Dickens in 1958. * Sir Ian McKellen English Actor, Starred in Waiting for Godot in 2010. * James Earl Jones - American Actor, starred in Driving Miss Daisy in 2013. * Angela Lansbury - British-American Actor, starred in Driving Miss Daisy in 2013.

The film is based on the 1906 novel The Mother by Maxim Gorky. It is the first film in Pudovkin's \\"revolutionary trilogy\\", alongside The End of St. Petersburg (1927) and Storm Over Asia (aka The Heir to Genghis Khan) (1928). The film was banned in the United Kingdom in 1930 after the Masses Stage and Film Guild applied for permission to screen it in London. The film underwent restoration in 1968 in the Mosfilm studio and a sound track was added with music by Tikhon Khrennikov.\\"Tikhon Khrennikov ‚Äì Works\\" \\"–ú—É–∑—ã–∫–∞ –∫ —Ñ–∏–ª—å–º–∞–º\\" (film music) , Tikhon Nikolaevich Khrennikov home page  Plot  In this film, the mother of Pavel Vlasov is drawn into the revolutionary conflict when her husband and son find themselves on opposite sides during a workers' strike. After her husband dies during the failed strike, she betrays her son's ideology in order to try, in vain, to save his life. He is arrested, tried in what amounts to a judicial farce, and sentenced to heavy labor in a prison camp. During his incarceration, his mother aligns herself with him and his ideology and joins the revolutionaries. In the climax of the movie, the mother and hundreds of others march to the prison in order to free the prisoners, who are aware of the plan and have planned their escape. Ultimately, the troops of the Tsar suppress the uprising, killing both mother and son in the final scenes.

The Mickey Cobras main source of income is wholesale distribution of heroin, cocaine and marijuana to other gangs, where most gangs must deal within their own. On April 5, 2005, US Attorney Patrick J. Fitzgerald described The Mickey Cobras (few in numbers compared to other gangs with same power) as one of several \\"super-gangs\\" that constitute a sizable portion of Chicago's overall gang population.Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. House of Representatives April 5, 2005 Some of their rivals would include Folk Nation, some BPS and Vice Lord sets. Traces of the gang can now be found in Chicago and Detroit. History=\\"Egyptian Cobras\\" The Egyptian Cobras formed in the year 1954 on Chicago‚Äôs west side on the corner of Roosevelt and Maxwell. The founder of the Egyptian Cobras was James Cogwell. During the mid 1950s the Egyptian Cobras fought heavily with a gang called the 14th Street Clovers. The 14th Street Clovers were the gang that later became the Vice Lords in the late 1950s. After several members of the 14th Street Clovers were incarcerated by 1957, the Egyptian Cobras had less competition. While incarcerated in the St. Charles Reformatory for Boys, the Clovers organized and became the Vice Lords. When the Vice Lords returned to Lawndale in the year 1958, they soon swelled into a force to be reckoned with. The Vice Lords were very aggressive and the dominant gang in Lawndale; by the year 1960 the Egyptian Cobras sought better opportunities on the South Side of Chicago. They relocated to the Woodlawn community. Cogwell led the Egyptian King Cobras as they gained a foothold and reputation in Chicago. In the year 1966 the Cobras new leader Henry (Mickey) Cogwell held second highest position in the Main 21 alliance, comprising the leaders of different gangs within the Black P. Stone Nation (BPSN). The Cobras and the Black P. Stone Nation allied against the Disciple Alliance and later the Gangster Nation. The Egyptian Cobras then changed their name to the Cobras Stones in 1966. \\"Mickey Cobras Gang\\" Mickey Cogwell and the Cobras policed the police in their communities, receiving government grants to feed kids breakfast in Fuller Park area before public schools offered meals - the template for school free lunch programs all over America - and worked as an organizer for a south side union. In 1970, the commander of the Gang Intelligence Unit for the Chicago Police Department portrayed Cogwell as the link between gangs and organized crime, particularly the Chicago Outfit. On February 25, 1977, Mickey Cogwell was assassinated by the Black P Stone leader because of his power within the People Nation, and his followers changed their organization's name again in late '70s early '80s, becoming the Mickey Cobras in his honor. The Mickey Cobras operate mainly in Chicago and surrounding suburbs, their main base of operation is particularly in the area around Fuller Park, and the Austin neighborhood.The Chicago Tribune, February 23, 2006  Involvement in Crime  The gang has been involved in many drug related criminal activities as well as criminal activities that surround the gang lifestyle such as homicide, extortion and robbery. Cornell Green Case Cornell Green was the second-highest ranked \\"king\\" in the Mickey Cobras street gang. Federal agents in the United States wanted Green to cooperate, and reports are falsely accusing him of doing so, although he refused. He was sentenced in September 2001 to 30 years in prison for the operation of a large-scale heroin operation on the South side of Chicago. Green was among 15 people who were prosecuted as part of this drug ring. Some of the other members prosecuted involved: -Robert Thomas, aged 30, was the only one of the 15 defendants to go to trial; he received a 30-year sentence. -Kamorudeen Sowemimo, aged 31, was convicted of being a major heroin supplier to the gang; he was sentenced to 14 years in prison. -Roderick Parker, who was one of the 15 defendants, had admitted to selling hundreds of the bags on an average day. Prosecutors stated that the drug trafficking operation ran by Green used street sellers with cell phones to keep customers posted on their changing locations. Between 1993 and early 2001 it was said that the gang had sold hundreds of \\"dime\\" bags (2/10 to 3/10 of a gram) for $10 per bag, and that Green made over $100,000 a week in profit from his drug sales. After Green and the others were indicted in May, Green had many assets that he owned including a house, furnished with hand carved Italian furniture and a home theatre, as well as several luxury vehicles and fur coats which he in turn had to give up as part of his plea bargain. The final total in cost of assets lost to the plea bargain is unknown. Organizational Characteristics Today the Mickey Cobras are known formally as the \\"Reformed Kingdom of Mickey's Cobras\\". In their original identity, they were known as the Egyptian King Cobras. Islamic Influence After three generations, the group has come to have a strong Islamic influence. The Mickey Cobras now have their own unique written constitution and by-laws, which show a strong Islamic influence, just like those of the modern-day BPSN. In the Illinois prison system, they are a part of the People Nation. The collective name of joined gangs under the five point star banner(V.L.,B.P.S.,L.K., M.C.,4.C.H.,).

Biography He was the son of John Philip Anderson Morshead, educated at Winchester College and New College, Oxford; and later returned to teach classics at Winchester in the 1870s, 80s and 90s. There, he gained the nickname \\"Mush\\" (his classroom hence inevitably becoming the \\"Mushroom\\"). Morshead was famed for his personal idiolect, eccentric even by the standards of Victorian schoolmasters, known as \\"Mushri\\". His pupils compiled and privately published a \\"Mushri-English pronouncing dictionary\\", which proved popular enough to run to seven editions. It now forms a valuable source for research into upper-class slang in Victorian England. Morshead has been described by the academic Christopher Stray as a \\"Liberal among Tories\\", an eccentric and an individualist. Notably for a classicist in the late 19th century, he spoke out against the view, held by some of his colleagues, of science as \\"the enemy\\", and considered some defences of his discipline as bigoted, ill-informed assaults upon it. Stray emphasises his contribution to personal idiosyncrasy in the increasingly homogenous age of the Industrial Revolution, and draws parallels between Morshead's teaching and that of teachers in the Greek and Roman era. Translations Morshead is chiefly known for his translations into English of the plays of Aeschylus, written in metred verse. His language is often archaic and makes great use of eye rhymes and similar devices. *The House of Atreus *The Suppliant Maidens *The Persians *Seven Against Thebes *Prometheus Bound Other works Morshead reviewed William Morris's translation of the Odyssey in \\"Academy\\" (vol. XXXI, p. 299), published on 30 April 1887. New College, Oxford also holds in its archives an essay written by Morshead on 19 March 1886 for its Essay Society, on the Society's history.

Midwakh are crafted from a variety of materials including wood, bone, base metal, marble, steel, gold, silver, plastic (with a metal bowl), or glass. They may incorporate precious items such as diamonds, gemstones and rings of precious metal inscribed with symbols, such as a falcon similar to the one shown in the UAE coat of arms. The pipe may be crafted to resemble a dromedary camel, a highly revered animal in the UAE; the opening of the bowl shaped as the camel's mouth, with a small hole connected to a metal shaft inside the body of the pipe to conduct the smoke to the user.

Sears Operadora M√©xico, S.A. de C.V. is a department store chain located in Mexico, operating more than 95 stores all over Mexico. Sears M√©xico is operated by Grupo Carso.  History = Early History  On 26 February 1947, the first Sears in Mexico was opened in Mexico City by Sears, Roebuck and Co. to an excited public. In the first three days of operation around 110,000 guests visited the store spending around $600,000 on goods. In its first week of operation, the store struggled to stock its shelves, requiring three airplanes to fly in more goods from a Texas warehouse owned by the parent company. Its introduction to the Mexican economy is seen by some as helping to usher in a consumer evolution in Mexico, shifting the nation's focus from nationalism and redistribution of wealth to happiness and individual self-realization. In its first year of operation, the Mexico City store did around $16 million in business, almost twice as much as was expected by its parent company. However, just a few months after opening, in order to prevent a drain on the nation's foreign-currency reserves, Mexico barred some nonessential imports and raised tariffs on others. This impacted the Mexico City store tremendously, which was at the time importing around 90 percent of its merchandise. This forced the store to create alliances with Mexican manufacturers, offering financial and technical aid to suppliers to meet its burgeoning demand for goods. It also bought interest in factories that were producing its merchandise. By 1949, Sears Mexico had around 2,500 Mexican suppliers furnishing some 80 percent of the goods in the Mexico City store. A second and third Sears were opened in 1949 in Monterrey and Guadalajara, and by 1953 Sears had seven stores in Mexico and annual sales of more than $15 million and employed around 1,900 people. These employees received unheard of benefits from the company including: overtime, merit raises, cost-of-living allowances, paid vacations, retirement funds, access to company cafeterias, free medical treatment and medicines and discounts on purchases. By 1956 there were 17 Sears stores in Mexico with a sales volume of around $25 million. There were around 3,200 employees at that time, all but 16 of which were Mexican citizens. Additionally, about 90 percent of the merchandise sold in its stores was made in Mexico.  Grupo Carso  On April 2, 1997, Sears formed a strategic alliance with Grupo Carso, owned by Mexican businessman Carlos Slim Hel√∫, through which Sears agreed to sell 85% of its share of Sears Mexico to Grupo Carso, until 1997. As of 2007, Grupo Carso owned a 100% share of the company. Even though Sears unveiled a new lowercase logo in the United States in 2010, Sears Mexico changed its logo to a red variant of the 1994-2004 Sears uppercase blue logo in 2013. Despite the bankruptcy of its former parent company, the closing of many stores in the United States and Canada, and subsequent sale to ESL Investments, Sears Mexico still remains open for business due to different ownership.

He played for both the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and the Ottawa Rough Riders. He was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in August 1985. In 2014, he was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame. Early life Gabriel was born in Burlington, Ontario on December 11, 1948, and attended Burlington Central High School from 1962 to 1967. While at BCHS, Gabriel played both football and basketball. He was a member of the Junior Basketball Championship team from 1965. He was honoured in 1967, with the M.M. Robinson Gold Medal for top student athlete at BCHS. Two memories that stick out in his mind from being a Trojan were, firstly, not making the football team in his grade ten year; and in his grade 13 year, scoring 48 points in a senior basketball game to completely outscore the entire Nelson team. Gabriel was active throughout high school playing junior football for the Burlington Braves under the direction of famed coach Bernie Custis.Bernie Custis From there he attended Syracuse University from 1968‚Äì1971 where he played split-end for coach Ben Schwartzwalder. Following his time in college, he went on to have a legendary professional football career in the Canadian Football League with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats from 1971‚Äì1974, and with the Ottawa Rough Riders from 1975‚Äì1981. Professional career Gabriel's first CFL year with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in 1971, was rather mediocre, with only 20 catches for 265 yards and one touchdown. With rookie quarterback Chuck Ealey in 1972 Gabriel caught 49 passes for 733 yards and 3 scores during the season and helped the team win the Grey Cup over the Saskatchewan Roughriders. After the 1974 season he joined the Ottawa Rough Riders. With Ottawa he had five seasons of over 1,000 yards receiving, including four consecutive seasons from 1975 to 1978, with the other in 1981. In 1976 and 1977 Gabriel led the CFL in receiving yards with 1320 and 1362 respectively. There would not be another Canadian receiver with this accomplishment until the Stampeders' Dave Sapunjis in 1993. The 1976 Grey Cup game is perhaps what fans most remember of Gabriel, with his late fourth-quarter touchdown catch from Tom Clements that won the game over the Saskatchewan Roughriders. In 1978 he was awarded the Schenley Award for the Most Valuable Player in the CFL, becoming the first Canadian to win the prize in almost 10 years. This feat was not repeated until 2013. In his career Gabriel was chosen ten consecutive times as the EFC/East Division's all-star tight end from 1972 to 1981. As well he was named to the league's all star team as the tight end in 1972 and from 1974 to 1980. The 1981 Grey Cup game saw the Rough Riders play the Edmonton Eskimos. Gabriel entered the game with a partial ligament tear in his left knee. Late in the game following a questionable penalty, Gabriel left the game when his knee finally gave out, never to play professionally again. At the time, Gabriel stood at third among the all-time receivers behind only Tom Scott and Tommy Joe Coffey. This also made him first among Canadian receivers. In his 11 seasons, he caught 614 passes for 9832 yards and 69 touchdowns. He was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in August 1985 and in November 2006, was voted one of the CFL's Top 50 players (#18) of the league's modern era by Canadian sports network The Sports Network/TSN.

() is an upscale chain of department stores in Mexico. Its flagship store in Polanco, Mexico City, which the company calls \\"El Palacio de los Palacios\\" (\\"The palace of all palaces\\"), reopened in 2016 after an extensive renovation of US$300 million and an expansion of . It is the largest department store in Latin America.\\"El Palacio de Hierro strengthens Mexico City standing, revamps flagship\\", NPR; November 3, 2015 History Original 1891 store, still in operation, Historic center of Mexico City El Palacio de Hierro Polanco store, Mexico City In the 1850s, a clothing store opened in Mexico City called \\"Las F√°bricas de Francia\\" (The Factories of France) which was owned by Victor Gassier, a Frenchman (not to be confused with the currently existing stores F√°bricas de Francia, operated by El Puerto de Liverpool). In 1860, Gassier teamed up with Alexander Reynaud, forming a business called Gassier & Reynaud. In 1876, Jos√© Tron, his brother Henri and Jos√© Leautaud bought in, forming the association V. Gassier & Reynaud, Sucs. S. en C. In 1879 the business' formal name was changed to J. Tron y C√≠a.. However, it continued to trade as \\"Las F√°bricas de Francia\\". From here Tron and Leautaud's endeavor met with considerable success. In 1879, they began planning to build a department store in Mexico City similar to famous upscale, and high class stores in Paris (Le Bon March√©), New York City (Saks Fifth Avenue), London (Harrods), and Amsterdam (De Bijenkorf). Inside of an El Palacio de Hierro store In 1888 they bought land to construct their new department store. They hired the Mexican architect Ignacio de la Hidalga for the project and construction was to last until 1891. Tron and Leautaud chose to build a five-story building. It was, notably the first building in Mexico City made of iron and steel. As the first such structure in Mexico, people who passed by often asked \\"What iron palace are they building?\\". In 1891, when construction finished, Tron and Leautaud decided to rename the business \\"El Palacio de Hierro\\", taking advantage of the publicity they earned during construction. On April 15, 1914 a fire destroyed the building. Other buildings were then used. With the end of the Mexican Revolution, construction began on a new building designed by French architect Paul Dubois. The Art Nouveau building opened in 1920 with dual stained-glass ceilings by Jacques Gr√ºber (1870-1936) of Nancy, France. Nowadays, El Palacio de Hierro is part of Grupo Bal a diversified conglomerate in Mexico with interests in insurance, mining and retail. It is a comprehensive department store with product lines ranging from clothing, to houseware, furniture, jewelry, select foods, toys, spa, travel services, and electronics. Especially in the clothing area, it is a high-end retailer, carrying top Mexican domestic brands, as well as hosting many in-store boutiques from exclusive lines such as Emilio Pucci, Tiffany's, Tommy Hilfiger, Cartier, Esprit, Max Mara, BCBG Max Azria, Emporio Armani, Fendi, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Tory Burch, Salvatore Ferragamo, Prada, Ermenegildo Zegna, Ralph Lauren, Chanel, Versace, Swarovski, Michael Kors, Burberry, Escada, Juicy Couture, Carolina Herrera, Mango, Bvlgari, Bottega Veneta, and Herm√®s.

He became a Judge of the Supreme Court of Tasmania, and was Administrator of Tasmania from November 1923 to June 1924. Early life Norman Ewing was born in Wollongong, New South Wales on 26 December 1870. The son of Anglican clergyman Thomas Campbell Ewing and Elizabeth n√©e Thomson, one of his uncles was John Thomson, who would himself become a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. His brothers were John Ewing and Sir Thomas Ewing, who were also members of parliament (though in different jurisdictions). Ewing was educated at Illawarra College in Wollongong, then Oakwoods at Mittagong, and finally night school in Sydney. Articled to M. A. H. Fitzhardinge, he became a solicitor in 1894, practising initially at Murwillumbah. Politics Ewing in 1897 In 1895, he contested the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Tweed for the Protectionist Party, but was unsuccessful. Later that year, Ewing moved to Perth, Western Australia. He was admitted to the bar the following year, and in 1897 established the firm of Ewing and Downing. That year he published The Practice of the Local Courts of Western Australia. On 4 May 1897, Norman Ewing was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly seat of Swan. A few months later he married Maude Louisa Stone, daughter of Sir Edward Stone. They would have one son and two daughters. Ewing held the seat of Swan until March 1901, when he resigned it to take up a short-term seat in the first Australian Senate, which he had won on a Free Trade ticket. His term was due to continue until 31 December 1903. In 1902, while still a Senator, Ewing stood unsuccessfully for the position of Mayor of Perth. He resigned as Senator eight months early on 17 April 1903, becoming the first member of either house of the Australian Parliament to resign his seat. In 1905, Ewing moved to Hobart, Tasmania, where he established the firm of Ewing and Seager. In the federal election of 12 December 1906, he contested a Tasmanian seat in the Senate as an Anti- Socialist, but was defeated by a small margin. He then turned to Tasmanian state politics, winning the Tasmanian House of Assembly seat of Franklin in April 1909. He would hold the seat for over six years, for the last year of which he was Leader of the Opposition. Supreme Court of Tasmania Ewing was made a King's Counsel in 1914, and in September the following year resigned his seat in parliament to accept an appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court of Tasmania. As Judge of the Supreme Court, he was involved in the 1915 Tasmanian Royal Commission into the public debt sinking fund; charges brought against Dr Victor Ratten in 1918. He was appointed a Deputy Judge of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory and chair of the 1919‚Äì20 Royal Commission into the administration of the Northern Territory, known as the Darwin Rebellion. He also conducted the 1920 Royal Commission in New South Wales into the imprisonment of twelve Industrial Workers of the World members. From November 1923 to June 1924, Ewing was appointed Administrator of Tasmania, while awaiting the arrival of the new governor Captain Sir James O'Grady. In 1924 he had a stroke, and thereafter worked only intermittently. He died at Launceston on 19 July 1928, and was buried at Carr Villa cemetery.

It is located one mile north of Bude. History and notable buildings Poughill is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Pochelle. Notable old houses in Poughill include Burshill Manor (medieval), an open hall house, and Church House, dated 1525. The village's water-mill is located on the footpath towards Bush. Lying at the foot of Trevalgus Hill in thick woodland, it is believed to have been a manorial mill for Trevalgus Manor. The mill was powered by the stream which runs south towards Stratton called the Stratt. Part of the mill building was constructed of timbers from ships wrecked along the coastline. St Olaf's Church At the heart of the village is St Olaf's church. The church is of exceptional interest and dates from the 14th century. The frescoes date from about 1470, and depict St Christopher. Battle of Stamford Hill The Battle of Stamford Hill, also known as the Battle of Stratton, was fought on the outskirts of Poughill on 16 May 1643. Each May, on the closest weekend to the anniversary, there is a two-day re-enactment of the battle, fought over the Saturday and Sunday, together with a procession through the streets of neighbouring Stratton village. Notable residents During the latter half of his life, Sir Goldsworthy Gurney, the surgeon, gentleman scientist, inventor, and pioneer of applying steam power, lived in Reeds, a small house on the outskirts of the village, until his death in 1875. Sir Henry Lovell Goldsworthy Gurney, a Malaysian colonial administrator assassinated by Communist extremists during the Malayan Emergency, was born here in 1898.A. J.

Some are true, some contain elements of truth, and others are somewhat more fabricated. The myths and legends listed below represent a select few of the traditions and stories associated with Cambridge. The Mathematical Bridge The Mathematical Bridge One famous narrative relates to Queens' College's so- called Mathematical Bridge (pictured right). The story usually goes as follows: constructed by Sir Isaac Newton, it held itself together without any bolts or screws. Years later, inquisitive students took it apart in order to see how it fitted together and the deconstructers were unable to reassemble it without bolts. (A variation on this tale has the bridge being dismantled by the college's Fellows due to the onset of World War II). However the bridge was erected 22 years after Newton's death and always used pins and screws at the joints (although the current version of the bridge does use more visible nuts and bolts).accessed 22 March 2006) Clare College bridge Clare Bridge's missing wedge Other tales involve the Clare Bridge of Clare College, built 1639‚Äì40(accessed 22 March 2006) which is adorned with spherical stone ornaments. One of these has a quarter sphere wedge removed from the back, a feature pointed out on almost all tours over the bridge. Three tales explaining this are: #The bridge's builder was not paid in full due to the college's dissatisfaction with its construction. The builder thus took his revenge by committing a small act of petty vandalism. #A college fellow removed the quarter-sphere to ensure another fellow could not win a bet with him as to how many spheres there are on the bridge. #The sphere was deliberately incomplete so that Clare College could avoid paying a \\"bridge tax\\"; an unfinished bridge did not count. In reality, the reason for the missing wedge is due to a weathered repair. As a result of corrosion of the sphere's fixing to the bridge, it became loose. It was removed, and a segment cut out to allow access to the fixing, set in place with cement, and the segment replaced. It was orientated with the cut facing outward so that it would be least noticeable to people crossing the bridge. Through subsequent weathering of the cement, the segment detached from the rest of the sphere, and presumably fell into the river. On close examination, it can be seen that a number of the other spheres have had similar repairs carried out, but their cut segments have remained attached. The Bridge of Sighs On two separate occasions, students have pulled the prank of dangling a car under the Bridge of Sighs at St John's. In the first incident (in 1963), a 1928 Austin Seven was punted down the river using four punts that had been lashed together then hoisted up under the bridge using ropes. The second incident (in 1968) involved a Reliant Regal (a three-wheeled car) being dangled under the bridge; it was cut down by the fire brigade in the morning.Cambridge Evening News, November 25th 1968 In neither case was the bridge damaged. The Night Climbers of Cambridge The Night Climbers of Cambridge was a book written under the pseudonym \\"Whipplesnaith\\" about nocturnal climbing on the colleges and town buildings of Cambridge, England, in the 1930s. The book remains popular among students. It is often credited with popularising and inspiring the first generation of urban exploring and night climbing. left A new authorised edition of The Night Climbers of Cambridge () was published on 26 October 2007 by Oleander Press, Cambridge, to mark the 70th anniversary of the original edition. The new edition was updated and has proved popular among students and urban explorers. Car on the Senate House roof The story of the Austin Seven delivery van that ended up on the apex of the Senate House is not fictitious. The Caius College website recounts how, on 8 June 1958, this vehicle really did go \\"up in the world\\". The prank team comprised Peter Davey (organiser), Cyril Pritchett, David Fowler and 9 others.The Legend of the Austin 7 , Gonville & Caius College (6 pages; retrieved 2008-08-17, broken link fixed 2013-06-29) King's College Chapel Objects on King's College chapel One story tells of a couple of students with a keen interest in climbing, who decided to scale the walls of King's College chapel after hours and place a roadcone (or similar object) atop one of the spires. On discovering the object the next morning, the college are said to have called in a building company to erect scaffolding in order to remove the offending object. However, the erection of the scaffolding could not be completed before dusk, and so the adventurous students ascended the chapel the next night and moved the roadcone to the opposite end of the chapel's roof, thus rendering the half-erect scaffolding useless. Parts of these attempts are described in The Night Climbers of Cambridge. In 2002, a single toilet seat placed by a student on one of the spires remained there, eventually being retrieved by a steeplejack. In late November 2009 santa hats were placed on each of the four spires of the Chapel overnight. The College had these removed by a professional steeplejack at great expense. Trinity College's riches As the wealthiest of all Oxbridge colleges, Trinity College is naturally the subject of many rumours and popular urban legends. The college is sometimes suggested to be the second, third or fourth wealthiest landowner in the UK (or in England) ‚Äî after the Crown Estate, the National Trust and the Church of England. (A variant of this legend is repeated in the Tom Sharpe novel Porterhouse Blue.) In 2005, it was reported that the college takes in ¬£20 million plus per year in rent from its properties.Cambridge and Oxford Adopt U.S. Methods to Win Alumni Donations , Bloomberg.com, 2005-11-30 (retrieved 2008-08-17) In comparison, the National Trust received about ¬£42.6 million in rental income from its properties in 2005-06.Annual Report 2006-07 , National Trust (pdf), p10 Trinity College, Cambridge A second legend is that it is possible to walk from Cambridge to Oxford solely on land owned by Trinity. Jeremy Fairbrother, the college's senior bursar in 2005, has said this belief is incorrect.

Background Rodrigo Rojas was born in the port of Valpara√≠so, the son of Ver√≥nica de Negri, a communist party activist. In 1976 at the age of 10, and after the Chilean coup of 1973, he was sent to live with relatives in Canada. Soon thereafter, his mother was arrested for political activities against the government of General Augusto Pinochet and later exiled. They were reunited and settled in the Washington D.C. area of the United States. There he attended Woodrow Wilson High School, and later studied photography. In 1986, Rojas de Negri, by then a young American photographer, decided to visit Chile for the first time since he had left for the exile. Events of the case During this time Chile was experiencing widespread political instability and human rights abuses. A national protest was organized for 2‚Äì3 July 1986. Rodrigo Rojas, who had been in the country for only six weeks, decided to try to participate and document the barricades that were going up in different areas of Santiago.'Witness archives of the BBC (MP3) At 8:00 am on 2 July 1986, he was among a small group of people that were setting up a barricade in the Los Nogales neighborhood, in the municipality of Estacion Central. According to the official report, endorsed and quoted at a speech by General Pinochet himself, the group was carrying five old tires, a molotov cocktail and a gallon of gasoline. They were intercepted by an army patrol that was clearing barricades in the area of General Vel√°zquez Avenue. All escaped except for Rojas and Carmen Quintana, an engineering student at the University of Santiago. The patrol, under the command of Lieutenant Pedro Fern√°ndez Dittus, was composed of three officers, five noncommissioned officers, and 17 soldiers. There are two versions of the succeeding events: the first, which was officially endorsed and quoted by General Pinochet at a speech, states that as Quintana and Rojas were arrested by a military patrol, some of the molotov cocktails they were carrying broke, setting them on fire accidentally. The opposing version (of Quintana, the only survivor) alleges that both were severely beaten by military personnel, and later soaked with gasoline and set on fire. After both were aflame and unconscious, patrol members wrapped them in blankets, loaded them into a military vehicle and drove them to an isolated road in the outskirts of Santiago, over 20 kilometers away. There, in an irrigation ditch, they were dumped and left to die. Some agricultural workers found them and notified the police, who then took them to a public hospital. Rodrigo Rojas' burns were fatal. He had second- and third-degree burns that covered 90% of his body, a broken mandible and broken ribs, and a collapsed lung. He lingered for four days after the incident, and died on 6 July 1986.Memories of Rodrigo Rojas's last days by his mother Aftermath The US ambassador to Chile at the time was unsuccessful at securing the transport of the severely injured Rojas to a better hospital before his death, which happened four days after the attack. His funeral in Santiago was attended by thousands, including the ambassador, and ended with the Chilean military tear- gassing the mourners. On 3 January 1991 a military court found Pedro Fern√°ndez Dittus guilty of negligence for failing to get medical attention for Rojas, but absolved him of any responsibility in the Quintana burning. Two years later, the Supreme Court sentenced Fern√°ndez Dittus to 600 days in prison for his responsibility in the burning death of Rojas de Negri and the serious burns sustained by Quintana. In October 2000 a court ordered the government to pay Quintana 251.7 million pesos (about US$500,000) in compensatory damages.See the 1999 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices Released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. State Department, on 25 February 2000 regarding Chile (1999 see \\"Country Reports on Human Rights Practices\\" and \\"Respect for Human Rights\\", Section 1 letter C, paragraph 7 here In March 2019, three retired soldiers were found guilty of murder and attempted murder and sentenced to ten years imprisonment.

Amelia Fletcher and Rob Pursey were previously in the twee pop band Heavenly, and some have seen Tender Trap as representing a return to the pop aesthetic of that earlier band. On their first, electronically slanted album Film Molecules, the songs demonstrate an eclectic mix of musical styles, with a clear nod to the similarly eclectic approach taken by The Magnetic Fields on their 69 Love Songs album. The band's initial intention was to be a recording outfit only, due to their hatred of transporting drums from place to place. They compromised by playing live but using a CD player for backing beats. Additional live performers have included Claudia Gonson (of The Magnetic Fields) on drums, and Lupe N√∫√±ez-Fern√°ndez of Pipas and Amor de D√≠as, who was a guest vocalist on the Language Lessons EP and the second album 6 Billion People. After a quiet 2007‚Äì2008, Tender Trap reformed at the beginning of 2009 as a five piece, with additional members Elizabeth Morris (also in Allo Darlin') on guitar and vocals and Katrina Dixon (formerly of Police Cat, Sally Skull and The Garden City Project) on drums and vocals. They performed on the main stage at Indietracks festival in Derbyshire in July 2009 and the indoor stage in July 2010. Elizabeth Morris left to concentrate on Allo Darlin' in August 2010 and Emily Bennett (Betty And The Werewolves) joined the following month on guitar and vocals. In 2010, Tender Trap released Dansette Dansette, an album that finds Fletcher working with \\"up-and-coming British indie luminaries, rediscovering her musical beginnings, and continuing to incorporate and impart feminist consciousness through sharp, yet tender, pop songs\\" , Venus Zine 2010 Tender Trap article.

The \\"LF\\" designation refers to Lexus Future. The LF Series vehicles features coupes/convertibles, including: the LF-A, the LF-A Roadster, LF-LC, LF-CC, and the LF-C; sedans: the LF-S, LF-Sh, and LF-Gh; crossover SUVs: the LF-X and LF- Xh; and hatchbacks: the LF-Ch. The first concept vehicle of the LF Series, the LF-X, appeared in 2003. The LF Series utilizes L-finesse, a design philosophy named for \\"Leading Edge\\" and \\"finesse\\", which debuted on the LF Series concepts and later extended to all new production Lexus vehicles. New vehicle technologies on the LF Series include advanced instrumentation, multiple driver-selected vehicle configurations, hybrid and experimental powertrains, and unconventional driver interface designs. The vehicles also feature new design cues which derive from the L-finesse design language of \\"Intriguing Elegance\\" (Á¥î), \\"Incisive Simplicity\\" (Â¶ô), and \\"Seamless Anticipation\\" (‰∫à). Several of the LF concept vehicles have appeared close to their production counterparts, while the design cues of other LF concepts appeared on more distinctly different production vehicles. LF-A Lexus LF-A concept at the 2007 North American International Auto Show. The LF-A is a 2-door exotic concept car built as a prospective halo car for the Lexus division. Three versions have been shown, the first of which debuted at the 2005 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS). The designation stands for Lexus Future-Advance. The first concept was about five inches shorter than the Porsche 911 Turbo (996) with a wheelbase about nine inches longer, and was nearly in height about equal to the Ferrari F430 with a width of . It was powered by a V10 engine displacing 4.8 liters, generating over and had a top speed around . To maintain a near ideal weight distribution a rear transaxle is used and the radiators are mounted at the rear. A second revised version with a more completely furnished interior and exterior was unveiled two years later at the 2007 NAIAS as a possible future member of the Lexus F marque performance lineup. The interior gauges revealed a 9,000 RPM redline, however news reports speculated that it might not make the production version. The third version of the LF-A concept, a roadster model, premiered in 2008. Reports in 2006 indicated that the LF-A concept car had received the green- light for production. Prototypes of the LF-A had been spotted regularly undergoing testing at N√ºrburgring since October 2004, the famous motorsport race track in N√ºrburg, Germany. Numerous test vehicles have been equipped with automatic retractable rear wings, and carbon ceramic brake discs. The production vehicles were expected to carry V10 engines, putting the car in market competition with the Lamborghini Gallardo, Ferrari F430, the Porsche 911 (997), and the Chevrolet Corvette C6 ZR1. Pricing was estimated at over $225,000, and close to $400,000. In December 2007, Auto Express reported that the LF-A had set an unofficial 7:24 lap record at the N√ºrburgring. The production $375,000 Lexus LFA supercar debuted in 2009. LF-AR Lexus LF-A Roadster at the 2008 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. Designated LF-AR or LF-A Roadster, the roadster version of the LF-A concept car was first displayed at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit on January 13, 2008. Derived from the LF-A, the designation stands for Lexus Future- Advance Roadster. Initial specifications for the roadster are a V10 engine under 5.0 L with over and a top speed of over . The LF-A Roadster was also revealed to have a retractable rear spoiler for improved handling at speed. The LF-A Roadster show model featured side cameras in place of standard mirrors, and a two-tone interior. The model was designated with \\"F\\" badges indicating its place as a member of the Lexus F performance division. After its debut at the 2008 North American International Auto Show, the LF-A Roadster was also shown at the 2008 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, the 2008 Geneva Motor Show, the United States Open Championship tournament, and at Lexus exhibits in Japan. On August 12, 2009, news reports suggested that the LF-A would be released as the LF-L, with the change in name from A to L to signify its appearances at Le Mans and to draw on its pre-production racing development.

Though the interior has been teased online, Lexus never once opened the doors of the LF-Gh to reveal the full interior, which is why most critics are rumoring that the LF-Gh is a nutshell concept, in which only the exterior has purpose, and the inside components are not made up. LF-LC Lexus LF-LC concept at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show. Designated LF-LC for Lexus Future-Luxury Coupe, the concept two- door vehicle premiered in January 2012 at the North American International Auto Show. The vehicle's exterior and interior styling was created by the Calty Design Research center in Newport Beach, California, which previously developed the exterior styling of the first generation Lexus SC coupe and the fourth generation Lexus GS. The LF-LC features the brand's spindle-shaped grille which debuted several months prior on the fourth generation Lexus GS. The LF-LC features a front-engine, rear-wheel drive drivetrain layout, which incorporates a next-generation Advanced Lexus Hybrid Drive system. The interior features a remote touchscreen control system linked to two liquid crystal display (LCD) screens that measure in width. Smartphone-size touchscreens are placed on the door armrests for additional controls. The LF- LC was produced as a design study for a driver-focused vehicle at the direction of the Lexus Center in Japan, and work began on the concept in May 2010. The exterior appearance of the LF-LC was inadvertently leaked by Road & Track magazine several weeks prior to its scheduled auto show debut, a preview of its February 2012 issue with the LF-LC on its cover (under the headline \\"Stunning! New Lexus Super Coupe\\") was posted to YouTube. During the North American International Auto Show, Mark Templin; the vice president and general manager of Toyota's Lexus Division responded to a reporter \\"Would you like to see (the LF-LC) to be the next generation SC?. In a report from Autocars, Karl Schlicht, head of Lexus product planning, reportedly gave the LF-LC concept vehicle a 50/50 chance at making production in the future According to a report from Automotive News, the Lexus LF-LC concept is now headed for the showroom in the near future and could be production ready within three years. It is unclear if the new coupe will wear the SC nameplate or continued on with its concept name LC. However, this new coupe would filled the gap of the discontinued SC430 and finally give Lexus a much needed Nissan GT-R or Acura NSX rival. It has now officially confirmed the LF-LC for production. Lexus International executive vice-president Kazuo Ohara says the LF-LC coupe would be an all-new car, possibly built from a newly developed set of underpinnings, that would take around four years to make it to production. A series production model inspired by the 2012 LF-LC Concept is being developed under the Toyota 950A development program. Introduced at the 2016 North American International Auto Show, it went on sale as the LC500 in the second quarter of 2017, based on the new Toyota GA-L modular rear-wheel drive platform and the fifth generation LS flagship.

The vehicle was designed to seat 5 passengers. The LF-S was powered by a high-output hybrid V8 system with all- wheel drive, marking the conceptual debut of a Lexus vehicle with hybrid technology (the first luxury hybrid, the RX 400h, subsequently premiered in 2005 with a V6 hybrid powertrain, and in 2007 the LS 600h and LS 600h L hybrids debuted with hybrid V8 systems).

Although the LF-Sh debuted before the LS 460 and shared identical exterior dimensions as the standard wheelbase version of the fourth generation LS sedan, it was a subsequent development, thus it did not particularly influence the production model. Multiple details on the LF-Sh as a result, differed from the production model. Among them, the integrated exhaust vents were instead a seamless one-piece design versus a chrome-plated version. The LED headlamps did not appear on the standard production LS 460, but did later debut on the hybrid ultra-luxury LS 600h / LS 600h L. The long wheelbase model LS 460 L is a lengthened version of the LF-Sh/LS 460 standard wheelbase design. The LF-Sh concept premiered at the Tokyo Motor Show in late 2005, following the debut of Lexus in the home market of Japan, and predating the January 2006 debut of the LS 460 North America.

It is owned by Cumulus Media and airs a Mainstream Rock radio format. The playlist leans toward hard-edged classic rock with some current and recent titles included. The studios and offices are on NW 64th Street in Northwest Oklahoma City.KATT.com/station-information The transmitter is on the Northeast side on Ridgeway Road off NE 78th Street.Radio-Locator.com/WWLS-FM History=Early Years In 1960, the station first signed on as a stand- alone FM station, not co-owned with an established AM outlet.Broadcasting Yearbook 1961-1962 page B-134 It was owned by Ramar, Inc. and had its transmitter at the top of the Oklahoma Biltmore Hotel in downtown Oklahoma City. KIOO was started by two brothers from Northern Kentucky, Steve and Ted Bushelman. The station later switched to country music when it went by the call sign KJAK. It was owned by Jack Beasley's Big Chief Broadcasting Co. The call sign represented the owner's first name, Jack. KJAK was co-owned with AM 1140 KLPR (now KRMP). It was a daytimer country station in Oklahoma City. Jack Beasley, being a musician himself, had many ties to the country music industry. KLPR also owned a short-lived television station, KLPR-TV Channel 14, on the air in 1966 and 67. When Beasley got older, he owner-financed a sale of KLPR and KJAK to Ed Sossen. Due to Sossen's financial issues and two suspicious fires, the stations were subject to a bank takeover . After the fires, Bill Lacy ran the stations as the GM for the debtor in possession of the stations while a new owner could be found. Progressive Rock The FM station was changed to a progressive rock format, applying for the call letters KATT'. It began broadcasting as FM 100-The Cat on September 16, 1976. Once an hour a legal ID mumbled by Ira Lipson identified the station as KJAK, Oklahoma City. The station received the official telegram from the Federal Communications Commission at Christmas 1976 authorizing a call sign change to KATT. Transmission and studio facilities for KATT were below the AM tower in what was a former channel 14 TV transmitter building. The AM, KLPR studios were located adjacent to the old TV studio. KATT quickly became a success, filling a void for rock music, that wasn't as pop-sounding as found on Top 40 stations. With increased FM ratings, KATT and KLPR were sold to Sun Broadcasting of Dallas, which paid $866,000 for the AM/FM combo properties. Bill Lacey exited at the sale time as the GM. After the sale, the AM calls were changed to KATT and the FM became KATT-FM. Also after the sale, the FM studios were moved out of the transmitter building and combined with the facilities used by the AM. The former KATT transmitter site was located near I-240 and I-35. The KATT call sign was chosen by Ira \\"Eye\\" Lipson. He was the programming consultant to KATT, while serving as program director of KZEW \\"The Zoo\\" in Dallas. Barbara Marullo was the original program director. Air personalities in the early days included Stan Tacker, Traver Hulse, Jim Stafford (Jimbob), Linda (Gabby) Goldfarb, John Michael Scott, David Bell, Charlie Parker, and Danny Hopper. Stan, Traver, and Jim rotated morning drive time duties until Gabby came on board. Then it was Jim & Gabby for about one year. John Michael Scott handled middays, David Bell was on in the evenings. Hopper was the first overnight DJ, later followed by Parker. KATT's popularity saw a shift in radio listening for young adults in Oklahoma City. Some Top 40 AM stations attempted to catch the wave of progressive rock by featuring artists like Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan at night to show they were hip. KATT featured artists such as The Grateful Dead, Fleetwood Mac, The Who and Bob Seger on a regular basis. The station's on air personalities renamed the old cow town \\"Zoom City\\" and played long thematic sets of music that had not been heard on Oklahoma City radio. The concert calendar was filled with acts that got the support they needed to sell out the Myriad, Lloyd Noble Arena and the Fairgrounds on a regular basis. With successful Arbitron ratings, KATT stickers appeared on the rear windows of cars that crowded the parking lots of the Zoo Amphitheatre and the downtown Civic Center. There was even an animated television commercial on late night programs featuring the smiling form of the cartoon cat from the sticker finding his way along the highways of Oklahoma City. Move to Album Rock In the 1980s, the station shifted from a free form sound to a more structured album rock format, featuring the top tracks from the biggest selling rock albums. In 1999, KATT was acquired by Citadel Broadcasting, the forerunner to today's Cumulus Media.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2010 page D-442 For many years, KATT was powered at 100,000 watts, the maximum for non-grandfathered FM stations. It broadcast from a tower at 1,191 feet in height above average terrain (HAAT). In March 2008, KATT got a boost in antenna height, going up to 1,542 feet (470 meters). But it downgraded from a Class C to a Class C1, reducing to 29,000 watts in effective radiated power (ERP). This allowed for the upgrade of co-owned WWLS-FM 98.1, now broadcasting at the same power, 29,000 watts.

The film premiered at the Choseon Theater in April, 1929. More than one thousand extras from Na's hometown Hoeryong were employed in the filming of Salangeul chajaseo, making the film into a symbolic epic national exodus as a protest against the Japanese occupation of Korea. Originally entitled Crossing the Duman River (ÎëêÎßåÍ∞ïÏùÑ Í±¥ÎÑàÏÑú), the film was banned and censored by the Japanese occupying authorities after its first showing.

The Derg Uprising Princess Ijigayehu was imprisoned with the rest of the Imperial family on September 11, 1974, the day before Emperor Haile Selassie was deposed by the Derg. She died in early 1976 after medical neglect while still in prison. She was buried at the Ketchene Medhan Alem Church in Addis Ababa by her children and her mother who were under surveillance but not imprisoned.

The STP \\"is considered one of the 10 biggest recreational bicycle rides in the country, drawing riders from across the nation and from other nations\\", and has been operating since 1979. The ride is organized by the Cascade Bicycle Club. It is approximately in length. Most riders complete the distance in two days; however, 1854 of the nearly 8000 riders attempted to ride in one day (2018). About The ride takes place on the second or third weekend in July mostly on country roads, avoiding Interstate 5 (the freeway between the cities). The Cascade Bicycle Club describes the 2006 route as \\"pretty flat with the ‚ÄúBig Hill‚Äù coming at the 45-mile mark. It‚Äôs a mile long with about a 7 percent grade. ... The majority of the ride is on beautiful, rolling rural roads\\". In 2005 approximately of the were considered uphill with a combined ascent of approximately . The official midpoint is in Centralia, Washington, on the campus of Centralia College. Amenities include overnight accommodations, showers, first aid, chiropractic and massage, bicycle repair and storage, food and drink vendors, pancake feed and breakfast to go, live music, and a beer garden.http://stp.centralia.edu/ Support The ride is supported, meaning that food is provided at stops approximately every along the route. The stops include, in part,: Seward Park, Tenino, Vader, Goble, and Scappoosse. In 2004 volunteers handed out \\"more than 11,000 bananas, 4 tons of watermelon, 13,000 bagels and 18,000 sandwiches\\". There is some mechanical support, provided by Performance Bicycle stores from Tacoma, Seattle, Redmond and Lynwood WA. The Cascade Bicycle Club also arranges transportation for riders to Seattle the day before as well as a return trip to Seattle after the ride. History The first STP took place in 1979 and was a race. The ride has taken place every year since, including 1980 when the route was changed because of the eruption of Mount St. Helens, also ending in Seattle. Also in 1980 a new ride became the annual Ride from Seattle to Vancouver, BC and Party (RSVP). The following year Cascade Bicycle Club changed the event from a race to \\"recreational ride\\". Jerry Baker from Seattle was the winner of the first STP race. Baker, and Paul Wantzelius from Maple Valley, Washington, were the only riders who attended every consecutive STP, until their deaths, Wantzelius in 2010 and Baker in 2015. Despite being a cycling event people have taken part on unicycles, inline skates and two skateboarders have done it using a technique known as long distance skateboard pumping. Participation reached a peak in 1989, the tenth year (Paul Zakar, Director‚Äò86 to‚Äò89) when the limit of 10,000 riders took part. In recent years the Cascade Bicycle Club has imposed a limit on the number of participants. The limit was 9,000 in 2007. The 2010 event sold out 10,000 slots on April 26, 2010. The 32nd annual Group Health Seattle to Portland Bicycle Classic was held on July 9 and July 10, 2011 and sold out the 10,000 spots in advance.

A total of 58 people were killed and over 200 injured in the 12 bomb attacks in 11 places, all within a radius. The explosives used were found to be gelatin sticks activated by timer devices and were concealed in cars, motorcycles, bicycles, sideboxes of two-wheelers, denim and rexin bags, and fruit carts. Several bombs that failed to detonate were defused by bomb disposal squads of the Army, National Security Guards and Tamil Nadu Commando School. The bombings were apparently in retaliation to the earlier riots in the city in November - December the previous year, when Hindu fundamentalists groups killed 18 Muslimshttp://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1505/15050090.htm and looted several thousands of properties of Muslims following the murder of a traffic policeman named Selvaraj, by a member of the radical Islamist group Al Ummah. The main conspirator was found to be S A Basha, the founder of Al Ummah, an Islamic fundamentalist body. Investigators found out that the blasts were a part of larger conspiracy to target L.K.Advani, the leader of Bharatiya Janata Party on that day at 4 p.m in his election meeting. A judicial committee formed on 7 April 2000 under Justice P.R. Gokulakrishnan to probe the case confirmed that Al Ummah was responsible for the attacks. The committee tabled its final report in the Tamil Nadu Assembly on 18 May 2000, whose recommendations were accepted in principle by the state government. The trial of the case began on 7 March 2002 and as many as 1,300 witnesses were examined. S. A. Basha, the mastermind of the blasts was found guilty of hatching a criminal conspiracy to trigger a series of explosions there on 14 February 1998 and was convicted to life sentence along with 12 others. During September 2002, Imam Ali and four others, suspected to be involved in the blasts were killed in a police encounter in Bangalore. The loss reported by the platform vendors was several crores, but the state government awarded a compensation of to all the victims. An individual ceiling of was fixed as the maximum for each victim and a total of was awarded. Background The Hindu- Muslim fundamentalist group riots in the city culminate back to the early 1980s when there was a propaganda by Hindu Munnani, a Hindu religious extremist outfit, against the attacks on them. There were minor Muslim groups that emerged during the period and they sustained based on petty crimes. The Hindu owners and landlords pumped lot of funds for their establishments against the Muslim ones. The situation was communalized even at the level of pavement side merchants. Some Islamic fundamentalistic movements like Jihad Committee, Al Ummah and Islamic United Front became active in Tamil Nadu following the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992. In November 1997, three members of the Al Ummah murdered a police constable named Selvaraj, which lead to a protest by police. Police fired on Muslim mobs armed with bombs, knives, stones and sticks. There was widespread looting by the Hindu mob on Muslim establishments simultaneously. Many people were killed during the event, which is considered the culmination point for the serial bomb blasts. Two men, allegedly part of Al Ummah were killed along with 17 other people in the riots. The agency became popular among Muslim circles when they perpetrated a bomb blast in the building of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in Chennai in August 1993. The change to violent methods split the organisation, with some of the leaders distancing themselves or getting arrested.V.S. 2013, p. 30 Blast incidents On 14 February 1998, the first of the serial bombs exploded at 3.50 pm IST in a cycle stand at the Coimbatore Junction railway station, killing six people. There were allegations that suicide bombers were ready to target L.K. Advani, the leader of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), during his election meeting at 4 pm. At 3:55 pm, the second bomb went off in Sundarapuram, SB Towers, killing three people and the third at Shanmuganandham Road, the location of the meeting, killing four. The fourth blast occurred in the basement parking of Rajarajeswari Tower, a commercial complex. At 4:05 pm, a car bomb exploded at the entrance of the Coimbatore general hospital, killing two nurses, a patient and a doctor. The blast took place exactly in the place where a Muslim youth was charred to death in an earlier riots. At 4:10 pm, the sixth bomb went off at the Timber Mart and three bombs at the city's Variety Hall. The next blast at Poompugar killed two people. The penulatimate blast took place at 8:30 pm, at Karunanidhi Nagar, and the final one at 10 pm in Bazaar Street. Overall, in a span of six hours, the city witnessed 12 explosions that killed 58 people and injured more than 200 people. Investigators found out that the blasts were a part of larger conspiracy to target L.K. Advani at his 4 pm election meeting. One of the bombs went off away from the podium where he was to conduct his election rally. Since the blasts were masterminded by Islamic fundamentalists and planted in areas with a Hindu majority population, most of the victims were Hindus. There were also some Muslim victims, who were killed in the blasts. The blast near the RS Puram police station was the most powerful amongst the bombings and caused 12 casualties. The blasts were targeted at disrupting the commercial activities of the town and planted at commercial points. Most the victims belonged to other part of the city. Most of the victims were youth, who were participants in Advani's rally were killed in the blasts. Hindu fundamentalists attacked people at random and properties belonging to Muslims were ransacked, in the aftermath of the serial blasts.Shoham 2010, pp. 202‚Äì5 The explosives used were found to be gelatin sticks activated by timer devices. They were concealed in cars, motorcycles, bicycles, sideboxes of two- wheelers, denim and rexin bags, and in a cart loaded with pineapples. Several bombs that failed to detonate were defused by bomb disposal squads of the Army, National Security Guards and Tamil Nadu Commando School. An abandoned car laden with 70 kg of explosives, was found on East Lokamanya Street in R.S. Puram, close to the BJP meeting venue, gave cause for much anxiety for days until the complicated device was dismantled. Aftermath Tamil Nadu and South India are considered relatively free of communal riots and violence. The riots and the blasts following it were considered the first of its kind.Gilly 2009, p. 29 The incident put Tamil Nadu in the terrorist map.Shoham 2010, pp. 187‚Äì9 The ruling party at that time, the D.M.K came under severe criticism for this incident. Most political leaders and parties expressed shock and revulsion over the blasts. AIADMK general secretary Jayalalitha demanded that then CM Karunanidhi own \\"moral responsibility\\" for the blasts and resign. Following a report from the Union Home Ministry on the security situation in Coimbatore, polling in the Coimbatore Lok Sabha constituency was postponed from 22 to 28 February. The bomb blast also had strong political implications. The Bharatiya Janata Party candidate C.P. Radhakrishnan won by a record margin of over 1,00,000 votes in the 1998 Lok Sabha elections. For days after the explosions, the city of Coimbatore looked like a town deserted; business establishments, shops and roadside stalls remained closed and few people ventured out. Hotels refused admission to guests. Wild rumours of fresh bomb attacks spread. In middle-class localities, residents formed vigilante groups. Anyone new to a neighbourhood was watched closely. At R.S Puram, where several bombs had gone off, roads in some neighbourhoods were barricaded and \\"outsiders\\" were denied parking space for their cars. All this had more than a little to do with the car bomb discovered on East Lokamanya Road in R.S. Puram. For four days, attention was riveted on it. Residents in the locality moved out even as bomb disposal experts prepared to defuse the explosive. This incident came as a severe blow to the upcoming economy of Coimbatore. Real estate prices dropped temporarily, new investments to the city were temporarily halted. However, normalcy was restored within a few months. Dr. K. Radhakrishnan IPS, then appointed as city police commissioner Coimbatore, restored normalcy to the city. The loss reported by the platform vendors was several crores, but the state government awarded a compensation of to all the victims. An individual ceiling of was fixed as the maximum for each victim and a total of was awarded.Shoham 2010, pp. 209 Probe and arrests Within hours of the blasts, the Tamil Nadu Government banned the Muslim fundamentalist group Al Ummah and the Jihad Committee. Al Ummah founder-president S.A. Basha and 12 other members of the organisation were arrested in Chennai;Gilly 2009, p. 34 explosive materials and weapons were seized from his house in Triplicane, Chennai. Leaders of the Jihad Committee and the Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam (TMMK) were arrested in a State-wide crackdown. Among those arrested were Jihad Committee president R.M. Haniffa, general secretary Mohammed Haniffa, student wing secretary Akram Khan, TMMK president and college lecturer M.H. Jawahirulla and treasurer G.M. Pakkar. Over the next few days, over 100 activists of the three organisations were arrested at Keezhakkarai, Devakottai, Dindigul, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Nagercoil, Melapalayam and Udumalpet. About 1,000 others were detained as a precautionary measure. In Coimbatore district, nine persons were arrested; 528 others ‚Äì 326 Hindus and 202 Muslims ‚Äì were detained as a precautionary measure. In Coimbatore, joint combing operations undertaken for days after the blasts by the police, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), the Rapid Action Force (RAF) and the Swift Action Force (SAF) in Kottaimedu, Tirumal Street, N.H. Road, Vincent Road, Ukkadam, Al-Ameen Colony, Majeed Colony, Salamath Nagar and Saramedu yielded a huge haul of explosives and deadly weapons: 210 gelatin sticks, 540 pipe bombs, 575 petrol bombs, 1,100 electrical detonators and a large number of knives, swords, pickaxes and sickles. Abdul Nasir Madani, chief of Islamist political outfit called PDP, well known for his provoking speeches, was arrested by the police on 31 March 1998, for his alleged link with suspects of this blast.Gupta 2012, p. 60 Justice P.R. Gokulakrishnan Commission of Inquiry The Tamil Nadu government set up a one-man commission under Justice P.R. Gokulakrishnan to probe the blasts. The commission filed a report that was tabled in the Tamil Nadu Assembly on 27 November 1998. The report indicated that the seven instances of police firing in Coimbatore on 30 November and 1 December 1997, leading to the killing of eighteen Muslims, were justified. The report found out that the blasts were culminated by the killing of police constable Selvaraj on 29 November 1997 by three members of Al-Umma that led to a revolt by police personnel and subsequent police firings on Muslim mobs. The final report of the commission was tabled in the Assembly on 18 May 2000. The report indicted the police by stating \\"the lapse on the part of the police personnel, deputed for surveillance and checks, in discharging their duties more vigorously, vigilantly and intelligently\\". It also quoted that \\"for surveillance and checks, had been more vigilant before the bomb blasts, the tragic incidents... could have been averted\\". The report stated that several state and central vigilance warnings were discarded by the city police. The report concluded that the Muslim fundamentalist organisation Al Ummah, based in Tamil Nadu, hatched a conspiracy to \\"avenge\\" the killings of 18 Muslims during earlier riots. The report quoted that three human bombs named Amanuallah, Melapalayam Amjath Ali and Rafique alias Shanmugam, were targeting L.K. Advani, but could not penetrate the security cardon. The investigations found that the group used the videotapes of the deceased during the riots to mobilise sympathy and garner financial support from Muslim countries, mainly those comprising the Gulf. The report made several recommendations like deploying checkposts in sensitive areas, proscribing organisations acting against law, setting up separate intelligence wing and methods to evaluate feedback of lower level police officers. The government accepted the commission's findings in principle and stated that specific recommendations would be examined in detail by the respective departments before passing orders. Trial The trial of the case began on 7 March 2002 and as many as 1,300 witnesses were examined. S. A. Basha, the mastermind of the blasts was found guilty of hatching a criminal conspiracy to trigger a series of explosions there on 14 February 1998 and to create enmity between the two communities.N.C. 1998, p. 171 During 2002, as many as 168 people were facing trial and it came to 14 during the period of conviction of trial court in 2007. The arguments ended on 10 April 2007 and judgement was pronounced on 24 October 2007. Out of the 14 accused, 13 were found guilty of blasts and were convicted. Madani was the only one out of the 14 to be acquitted. Madani earlier sought bail stating health grounds. Basha, the chief conspirator was awarded life sentence and his aide, Mohammad Ansari was awarded twin life sentence that run concurrently. A revision petition was filed by a victim's father in Madras High Court against the acquittal of Madani. Another revision petition was filed in the court by the 39 convicts against their conviction and one another wanted the punishment of S A Basha to be enhanced to death sentence. The court passed orders on all the petitions on 18 December 2009. It upheld the trial court judgement of 18 Al Ummah activists and also the release of Madani. It however, acquitted 21 people convicted to life sentence by the lower court. During September 2002, Imam Ali and four others, suspected to be involved in the blasts were killed in a police encounter in Bangalore. Police recovered lot of arms and ammunition from the site where encounter happened. On 17 November 2009, nine members of Al Ummah, convicted in the blasts were released from jail for their good conduct, 16 months short of their full sentence on the occasion of 100th birth anniversary of Arignar Anna, the founder of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and ex-chief minister. Fakrudeen, one of the nine released early, was 16 at the time of the blast. He stated that the group avenged the earlier communal riots with the blasts. He said after the release that \\"I deeply regret the blasts. I have realised that we ought to have avenged the riots in court. We should not have retaliated with violence. The law offered many provisions for minorities. We should have used them to get justice\\".

Jews settled in the region in the 19th century, especially following a statute of Russian Tsar Alexander II in 1865 that allowed the so-called Jewish \\"Nicholas soldiers\\" (often former cantonists) and their descendants, First Guild merchants, artisans, and Jews with higher education to settle in Estonia and other parts of the Russian Empire outside the Pale of Settlement. The \\"Nicholas soldiers\\" and their descendants, and artisans were, basically, the ones who founded the first Jewish congregations in Estonia. The Tallinn congregation, the largest in Estonia, was founded in 1830. The Tartu congregation was established in 1866 when the first fifty families settled there. Synagogues were built, the largest of which were constructed in Tallinn in 1883 and Tartu in 1901. Both of these were subsequently destroyed by fire in World War II. The Jewish population spread to other Estonian cities where houses of prayer (at Valga, P√§rnu and Viljandi) were erected and cemeteries were established. Schools were opened to teach Talmud, and elementary schools were organised in Tallinn in the 1880s. The majority of Jews at that time consisted of small tradesmen and artisans; very few knew science, hence Jewish cultural life lagged. This began to change at the end of the 19th century when several Jews entered the University of Tartu and later contributed significantly to enliven Jewish culture and education. In 1917 the Jewish Drama Club was founded in Tartu. Jewish autonomy in independent Estonia Approximately 200 Jews fought in combat in the Estonian War of Independence (1918‚Äì1920) for the creation of the Republic of Estonia. 70 of these fighters were volunteers. The creation of the Republic of Estonia in 1918 marked the beginning of a new era in the life of Jews. From the independence of Estonia as a state, Estonia showed tolerance towards all ethnic and religious minorities. This set the stage for energetic growth in the political and cultural activities of Jewish society. Between 11 and 16 May 1919, the first Estonian Congress of Jewish congregations was convened to discuss the new circumstances Jewish life was confronting. This is where the ideas of cultural autonomy and a Jewish Gymnasium (secondary school) in Tallinn were born. Jewish societies and associations began to grow in numbers. The largest of these new societies was the H. N. Bjalik Literature and Drama Society in Tallinn founded in 1918. Societies and clubs were established in Viljandi, Narva, and elsewhere. 1920s In 1920, the Maccabi Sports Society was founded and became well known for its endeavours to encourage sports among Jews. Jews also took an active part in sporting events in Estonia and abroad. Sara Teitelbaum was a 17-time champion in Estonian athletics and established no fewer than 28 records. In the 1930s there were about 100 Jews studying at the University of Tartu: 44 studied jurisprudence and 18 medicine. In 1934, a chair was established in the School of Philosophy for the study of Judaica. There were five Jewish student societies in Tartu Academic Society: the Women's Student Society Hazfiro, the Corporation Limuvia, the Society Hasmonea and the Endowment for Jewish Students. All of these had their own libraries and played important roles in Jewish culture and social life. Political organisations such as Zionist youth organisations Hashomer Hazair and Beitar were also established. Many Jewish youth travelled to Palestine to establish the Jewish State. The kibbutzim of Kfar Blum and Ein Gev were set up in part by Estonian Jews. On 12 February 1925, the Estonian government passed a law on the cultural autonomy of minorities. The Jewish community quickly prepared its application for cultural autonomy. Statistics on Jewish citizens were compiled. They totalled 3,045, fulfilling the minimum requirement of 3,000 for cultural autonomy. In June 1926 the Jewish Cultural Council was elected and Jewish cultural autonomy declared. The administrative organ of this autonomy was the Board of Jewish Culture, headed by Hirsch Aisenstadt until it was disbanded following the Soviet occupation of Estonia in 1940. When German troops occupied Estonia in 1941, Aisenstadt evacuated to Russia. He returned to Estonia when the Germans had left, but was arrested by the Soviet authorities in 1949. The cultural autonomy of minority peoples is an exceptional phenomenon in European cultural history. Therefore, Jewish cultural autonomy was of great interest to the global Jewish community. The Jewish National Endowment Keren Kajamet presented the Estonian government with a certificate of gratitude for this achievement. This cultural autonomy allowed full control of education by the community. From 1926, Hebrew began to replace Russian in the Jewish public school in Tallinn, while in 1928 a rival Yiddish language school was founded. From the very first days of its existence as a state, Estonia showed tolerance towards all the peoples inhabiting its territories. In 1925, the Act of Cultural Autonomy for Ethnic Minorities was enacted in Estonia, giving minority groups consisting of at least 3,000 individuals the right to self-determination in cultural matters. Financial support was provided by the state. Thus, in 1926, Jewish cultural autonomy was declared. For its tolerant policy towards Jews, a page was dedicated to the Republic of Estonia in the Golden Book of Jerusalem in 1927. 1930s Bombing of Tallinn in 1944. In 1934, there were 4381 Jews living in Estonia (0.4% of the population). 2203 Jews lived in Tallinn. Other cities of residence included Tartu (920), Valga (262), P√§rnu (248), Narva (188) and Viljandi (121). 1688 Jews contributed to the national economy: 31% in commerce, 24% in services, 14.5% as artisans, and 14% as labourers. There were also large businesses: the leather factory Uzvanski and Sons in Tartu, the Ginovkeris' Candy Factory in Tallinn, furriers Ratner and Hoff, and forest improvement companies such as Seins and Judeiniks. There was a society for tradesmen and industrialists. Tallinn and Tartu boasted Jewish co-operative banks. Only 9.5% of the Jewish population worked freelance. Most of these were physicians, over 80 in all (there was also a society for Jewish physicians). In addition there were 16 pharmacists and 4 veterinarians. 11% of the Jewish population had received higher education, 37% secondary education and 33% elementary education. 18% had only received education at home. The Jewish community established its own social welfare system. The Jewish Goodwill Society of the Tallinn Congregation made it their business to oversee and execute the ambitions of this system. The Rabbi of Tallinn at that time was Dr. Gomer. In 1941 during the German occupation he was ruthlessly harassed and finally murdered. In Tartu the Jewish Assistance Union was active, and welfare units were set up in Narva, Valga and P√§rnu. In 1933 the influence of National Socialism on Baltic Germans began to be a concern. Nazism was outlawed as a movement contrary to social order, the German Cultural Council was disbanded, and the National Socialist Viktor von M√ºhlen, the elected member of the Baltic German Party, was forced to resign from the Riigikogu. All materials ridiculing Jews, including the National Socialist magazine \\"Valvur\\" (Guard) were banned by order of the State Elder Konstantin P√§ts as materials inciting hatred. In the same year a faculty of Jewish Studies was established at Tartu University. Lazar Gulkowitsch, a former professor at Leipzig University was appointed the university's first Professor and Chair of Jewish Studies and began teaching in 1934. In 1936, the British-based Jewish newspaper The Jewish Chronicle reported after a visit to Tallinn by one of its journalists: > \\"Estonia is the only country in Eastern Europe where neither the Government > nor the people practice any discrimination against Jews and where Jews are > left in peace.... the cultural autonomy granted to Estonian Jews ten years > ago still holds good, and Jews are allowed to lead a free and unmolested > life and fashion it in accord with their national and cultural principles.\\" In February 1937, as anti-semitism was growing elsewhere in Europe, the vice president of the Jewish Community Heinrich Gutkin was appointed by Presidential decree to the Estonian upper parliamentary chamber, the Riigin√µukogu. Throughout the 1930s, Zionist youth movements were active, with pioneer training being offered on Estonian farms by HeHalutz, while the leading cultural institute Bialik Farein performed plays and its choir toured and performed on radio. World War II The life of the small Jewish community in Estonia was disrupted in 1940 with the Soviet occupation of Estonia. Cultural autonomy together with all its institutions were liquidated in July 1940. In July and August of the same year all organisations, associations, societies and corporations were closed. Jewish businesses were nationalized. A relatively large number of Jews (350‚Äì450, about 10% of the total Jewish population) were deported into prison camps in Russia by the Soviet authorities on 14 June 1941, where most perished.Weiss-Wendt, Anton (1998).

More than 75% of Estonia's Jewish community, aware of the fate that otherwise awaited them, managed to escape to the Soviet Union; virtually all the remainder (between 950 and 1000 men, women and children) had been killed by the end of 1941. They included Estonia's only Rabbi; the professor of Jewish Studies at the University of Tartu; Jews who had left the Jewish community; the mentally disabled; and a number of veterans of the Estonian War of Independence. Fewer than a dozen Estonian Jews are known to have survived the war in Estonia.Conclusions of the Estonian International Commission for the Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity - Phase II: The German occupation of Estonia in 1941‚Äì1944 Round-ups and killings of Jews began immediately following the arrival of the first German troops in 1941, who were closely followed by the extermination squad Sonderkommando 1a under Martin Sandberger, part of Einsatzgruppe A led by Walter Stahlecker. Arrests and executions continued as the Germans, with the assistance of local collaborators, advanced through Estonia. Unlike German forces, Estonians seem to have supported the anti-Jewish actions on the political level, but not on a racial basis. The standard excuse used for the \\"cleansing\\" operations was arrest 'because of Communist activity'. This equation of Jews with Communism evoked a positive Estonian response, and attempts were made by Estonian police to determine whether an arrested person indeed supported Communism. Estonians often argued that their Jewish colleagues and friends were not communists and submitted proof of pro-Estonian conduct in the hope of being able to get them released.Birn, Ruth Bettina (2001), Collaboration with Nazi Germany in Eastern Europe: the Case of the Estonian Security Police. Contemporary European History 10.2, 181‚Äì198. Anton Weiss-Wendt in his dissertation \\"Murder Without Hatred: Estonians, the Holocaust, and the Problem of Collaboration\\" concluded on the basis of the reports of informers to the occupation authorities that Estonians in general did not believe in Nazi anti-Semitic propaganda and by majority maintained positive opinion about Jews.\\"Sur la fusion de l'Europe : la communaut√© juive estonienne et sa destruction\\". Par Paul Leslie, pour Guysen Isra√´l News Estonia was declared Judenfrei quite early, at the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942, as the Jewish population of Estonia was small (about 4,500), and the majority of it managed to escape to the Soviet Union before the Germans arrived. Virtually all the remainder (921 according to Martin Sandberger, 929 according to Evgenia Goorin-Loov and 963 according to Walter Stahlecker) were killed. The Nazi regime also established 22 concentration and labor camps in Estonia for foreign Jews, the largest being Vaivara concentration camp. Several thousand foreign Jews were killed at the Kalevi-Liiva camp. An estimated 10,000 Jews were killed in Estonia after having been deported there from Eastern Europe. There were two Estonians who have been honoured with The Righteous Among the Nations: Uku Masing and his wife Eha.The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust By Sir Martin Gilbert; P.31 Soviet period The four Estonians held most responsible for the murders at Kalevi-Liiva were accused at war crimes trials in 1961. Two were later executed; the others avoided sentencing by going into exile. About 1,500 Jews from Tallinn returned after the war's end, and by 1959 there were 3,714 Jews in the city. After the Six-Day War, 400 Jews from Tallinn immigrated to the State of Israel. From 1944 until 1988 the Estonian Jewish community had no organisations, associations, or clubs. Modern Estonia Tallinn Synagogue In March 1988, as the process towards regaining Estonia's independence was beginning, the Jewish Cultural Society was established in Tallinn. It was the first of its kind in the late Soviet Union. Unlike in other parts of the Soviet Union, there were no problems with registering either the society or its symbols. The Society began by organising concerts and lectures. Soon the question of founding a Jewish school arose. As a start, a Sunday school was established in 1989. The Tallinn Jewish Gymnasium on Karu Street was being used by a vocational school. In 1990, a Jewish School with grades 1 through 9 was established. Jewish culture clubs, which remained under the wing of the Cultural Society, were started in Tartu, Narva, and Kohtla- J√§rve. Other organisations followed: the sports society Maccabi, the Society for the Gurini Goodwill Endowment and the Jewish Veterans Union. Life returned to Jewish congregations. Courses in Hebrew were re-established. A relatively large library was opened with assistance from Israel and Jewish communities in other countries. The gamut of cultural activities kept on growing. The Jewish Cultural Society is a founding member of Eestimaa Rahvuste √úhendus (Union of the Peoples of Estonia), which was founded at the end of 1988. The restoration of Estonian independence in 1991 brought about numerous political, economic and social changes. The Jews living in Estonia could now defend their rights as a national minority. The Jewish Community was officially recognized with the approval of its charter on 11 April 1992. Estonia resumed its traditional regard of its Jews with friendship and accommodation. In support of this a new Cultural Autonomy Act, based on the original 1925 law, was passed in Estonia in October 1993. This law grants minority communities, including Jewish, a legal guarantee to preserve their national identities. On 16 May 2007 a new synagogue was opened in Tallinn. It houses a sanctuary, mikvah and restaurant.delfi.ee: Tallinna s√ºnagoog on avatud Historical Demographics Estonia always had a relatively small Jewish population. In contrast to many other European countries, Estonia's Jewish population peaked only after World War II, at almost five and a half thousand people in 1959. It then began a steady decline, with an especially sharp decline in the 1990s after the fall of Communism as many Estonian Jews emigrated to other countries, especially to Israel and USA.

Nominal systems are used to determine if types are equivalent, as well as if a type is a subtype of another. It contrasts with structural systems, where comparisons are based on the structure of the types in question and do not require explicit declarations.  Nominal typing  Nominal typing means that two variables are type-compatible if and only if their declarations name the same type. For example, in C, two \`struct\` types with different names in the same translation unit are never considered compatible, even if they have identical field declarations. However, C also allows a \`typedef\` declaration, which introduces an alias for an existing type. These are merely syntactical and do not differentiate the type from its alias for the purpose of type checking. This feature, present in many languages, can result in a loss of type safety when (for example) the same primitive integer type is used in two semantically distinct ways. Haskell provides the C-style syntactic alias in the form of the \`type\` declaration, as well as the \`newtype\` declaration that does introduce a new, distinct type, isomorphic to an existing type.  Nominal subtyping  In a similar fashion, nominal subtyping means that one type is a subtype of another if and only if it is explicitly declared to be so in its definition. Nominally-typed languages typically enforce the requirement that declared subtypes be structurally compatible (though Eiffel allows non-compatible subtypes to be declared). However, subtypes which are structurally compatible \\"by accident\\", but not declared as subtypes, are not considered to be subtypes. C++, C#, Java, Objective-C, Delphi, Swift, Julia and Rust all primarily use both nominal typing and nominal subtyping. Some nominally-subtyped languages, such as Java and C#, allow classes to be declared final (or sealed in C# terminology), indicating that no further subtyping is permitted.  Comparison  Nominal typing is useful at preventing accidental type equivalence, which allows better type-safety than structural typing. The cost is a reduced flexibility, as, for example, nominal typing does not allow new super-types to be created without modification of the existing subtypes.

Structural systems are used to determine if types are equivalent and whether a type is a subtype of another. It contrasts with nominative systems, where comparisons are based on the names of the types or explicit declarations, and duck typing, in which only the part of the structure accessed at runtime is checked for compatibility.  Description  In structural typing, an element is considered to be compatible with another if, for each feature within the second element's type, a corresponding and identical feature exists in the first element's type. Some languages may differ on the details, such as whether the features must match in name. This definition is not symmetric, and includes subtype compatibility. Two types are considered to be identical if each is compatible with the other. For example, OCaml uses structural typing on methods for compatibility of object types. Go uses structural typing on methods to determine compatibility of a type with an interface. C++ template functions exhibit structural typing on type arguments. Haxe uses structural typing, but classes are not structurally subtyped. In languages which support subtype polymorphism, a similar dichotomy can be formed based on how the subtype relationship is defined. One type is a subtype of another if and only if it contains all the features of the base type, or subtypes thereof. The subtype may contain added features, such as members not present in the base type, or stronger invariants. A distinction exists between structural substitution for inferred and non-inferred polymorphism. Some languages, such as Haskell, do not substitute structurally in the case where an expected type is declared (i.e., not inferred), e.g., only substitute for functions that are signature-based polymorphic via type inference. Then it is not possible to accidentally subtype a non-inferred type, although it may still be possible to provide an explicit conversion to a non-inferred type, which is invoked implicitly. Structural subtyping is arguably more flexible than nominative subtyping, as it permits the creation of ad hoc types and protocols; in particular, it permits creation of a type which is a supertype of an existing type, without modifying the definition of the latter. However, this may not be desirable where the programmer wishes to create closed abstractions. A pitfall of structural typing versus nominative typing is that two separately defined types intended for different purposes, but accidentally holding the same properties (e.g. both composed of a pair of integers), could be considered the same type by the type system, simply because they happen to have identical structure. One way this can be avoided is by creating one algebraic data type for each use. In 1990, Cook, et al., proved that inheritance is not subtyping in structurally-typed OO languages.  Example  Objects in OCaml are structurally typed by the names and types of their methods. Objects can be created directly (immediate objects) without going through a nominative class. Classes only serve as functions for creating objects. # let x = object val mutable x = 5 method get_x = x method set_x y = x <\\\\- y end;; val x : < get_x : int; set_x : int -> unit > = Here the OCaml interactive runtime prints out the inferred type of the object for convenience. Its type (\`< get_x : int; set_x : int -> unit >\`) is defined only by its methods. In other words, the type of x is defined by the method types \\"get_x : int\\" and \\"set_x : int -> unit\\" rather than by any name. To define another object, which has the same methods and types of methods: # let y = object method get_x = 2 method set_x y = Printf.printf \\"%d \\" y end;; val y : < get_x : int; set_x : int -> unit > = OCaml considers them the same type. For example, the equality operator is typed to only take two values of the same type: # x = y;; \\\\- : bool = false So they must be the same type, or else this wouldn't even type-check. This shows that equivalence of types is structural. One can define a function that invokes a method: # let set_to_10 a = a#set_x 10;; val set_to_10 : < set_x : int -> 'a; .. > -> 'a = The inferred type for the first argument (\`< set_x : int -> 'a; .. >\`) is interesting. The \`..\` means that the first argument can be any object which has a \\"set_x\\" method, which takes an int as argument. So it can be used on object \`x\`: # set_to_10 x;; \\\\- : unit = () Another object can be made that happens to have that method and method type; the other methods are irrelevant: # let z = object method blahblah = 2.5 method set_x y = Printf.printf \\"%d \\" y end;; val z : < blahblah : float; set_x : int -> unit > = The \\"set_to_10\\" function also works on it: # set_to_10 z;; 10 \\\\- : unit = () This shows that compatibility for things like method invocation is determined by structure. Let us define a type synonym for objects with only a \\"get_x\\" method and no other methods: # type simpler_obj = < get_x : int >;; type simpler_obj = < get_x : int > The object \`x\` is not of this type; but structurally, \`x\` is of a subtype of this type, since \`x\` contains a superset of its methods. So \`x\` can be coerced to this type: # (x :> simpler_obj);; \\\\- : simpler_obj = # (x :> simpler_obj)#get_x;; \\\\- : int = 10 But not object \`z\`, because it is not a structural subtype: # (z :> simpler_obj);; This expression cannot be coerced to type simpler_obj = < get_x : int >; it has type < blahblah : float; set_x : int -> unit > but is here used with type < get_x : int; .. > The first object type has no method get_x This shows that compatibility for widening coercions are structural.

Chen worked in Shanghai for his entire public life, serving as mayor from 2001 to 2003. Chen took on numerous mega-projects while he was mayor, including the mass expansion of the Shanghai Subway and the construction of the Yangshan Port. Chen contributed to the city's economic development and was instrumental in Shanghai's bid to host the 2010 World Expo. Chen, a prominent member of the Shanghai clique, was also known for his political partisanship and opposition to the macro-economic control policies of the Hu-Wen Administration. In September 2006, Chen was removed from office after a scandal came to light about the misuse of money in Shanghai's social security fund (see Shanghai pension scandal). He became the second incumbent Politburo member since the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests to be expelled from the party. In April 2008, Chen was sentenced to 18 years in prison upon conviction on charges of financial fraud and bribery. Rise to power Chen graduated from the PLA Institute of Logistics Engineering, majoring in architecture. He had two years of experience working in the military between 1968 and 1970 as part of the PLA 6716 Squadron. From September 1970 to March 1983, Chen worked at the Shanghai Pengpu Machinery Factory as a worker and estimator. He was eventually promoted to the capital construction branch vice- section chief. He also went on a year-long sabbatical to Tongji University. In March 1983 he was promoted to become deputy plant manager of the Shanghai Pengpu machine factory, as well as the party committee deputy secretary of the Shanghai Metallurgy Mining Machinery Company. He joined the Communist Party of China (CPC) in April 1980. By March 1984, Chen gained further promotion, becoming the CPC Secretary for Shanghai's Electronic Appliances Bureau. Between January 1985 and February 1987, he became bureau chief and assistant commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee ‚Äì Old cadre bureau. In February 1987, Chen gained a posting as the new magistrate for Huangpu District in Shanghai. He went on sabbatical studying public administration at the University of Birmingham from January to September 1992 through a UK government-funded Chevening Scholarship. Chen was promoted to be Deputy Mayor of Shanghai in 1996, concurrently holding the CPC Vice-Secretary position. As then Party general secretary Jiang Zemin made his political manoeuvers before the 16th Party Congress in 2002 to strengthen the Shanghai power base with his loyalties, Chen became the beneficiary, replacing then-Mayor Xu Kuangdi, becoming Mayor of Shanghai in late 2002, and Secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee in February 2003. He was therefore granted membership in the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee. As an ally of former general secretary Jiang Zemin, Chen was to keep Jiang's Shanghai base of power while Hu Jintao was given all official positions of power. Chen is believed to be linked to real estate magnate and banker Zhou Zhengyi in the Shanghai Real Estate scandals, where residents were forced to relocate for new housing developments where old-style apartments were being demolished to build modern- style condominiums. Mayor and party chief of Shanghai Chen Liangyu became the CPC Committee Secretary for Shanghai in November 2002, the city's top office. As is customary for the occupants of this office, he was also given a seat on the Politburo of the 16th CPC Central Committee. During Chen's term in office, Shanghai's economy grew rapidly, which contributed to significant improvements in the living standards of the city's residents. Economic growth During Chen's term in office, Shanghai's average annual economic growth rate stood at about 13%, at the forefront of the country, the average annual revenue growth of over 20%, and over the years turned over to the proportion of the central finance more than 15% The annual import and export volume of the Port of Shanghai exceeded 400 billion U.S. dollars, at an average annual increase of over 30%. The cargo throughput of the port exceeded 500 million tons, ranking first in the world. Municipal infrastructure and large-scale industrial production construction projects proceeded at a rapid pace; prominent examples include the Yangshan Deepwater Port (Figure), the Shanghai World Financial Center, the Shanghai Metro, and Jiangnan Shipyard Changxing Island base, and the Shanghai Chemical Industrial Zone. These large scale projects cemented Shanghai's position as the economic heart of the country. Improving the livelihood of the people and helping the poor Urban traffic congestion and poor public transit had been a long-standing problem in Shanghai. Chen Liangyu was personally invested in the issue, and during his term in office Shanghai saw significant improvements to its transit system and transport infrastructure. As a result of the urban rail construction during Chen's term, the Metro had overtaken buses as the main transport tool for most Shanghai residents. Additionally, Mr. Chen oversaw the construction of bridges and tunnels on the Huangpu River, such as the Lupu Bridge. Opening several new arterial bridges relieved pressure from existing bridges and tunnels, thus easing traffic jams. Due to historical reasons, the Shanghai area had large areas of shanty towns and old-fashioned neighborhoods, a large number of residents faced a housing shortage and poor living conditions. Chen Liangyu led the Shanghai municipal government in a vigorous urban transformation, in conjunction with the municipal engineering reasonable relocation and resettlement. This not only beautified the urban environment and improved the living conditions of the people, but it is also especially important due to the relocation and resettlement of the household population based on a per capita metric, which solved the housing problems of a large number of people, especially the impoverished, and reduced the burden of rising housing prices. Under Chen Liangyu's leadership, pollution in the Suzhou River, which had long plagued Shanghai, came under management. The Suzhou River water pollution problem was greatly reduced. Additionally, the landscape around the Suzhou River underwent massive changes. Chen Liangyu as the party secretary of Shanghai repeatedly stressed the need to protect low- income and vulnerable members of society. Mr. Chen started at the grassroots and personally visited people who were less well-off; he additionally supervised the implementation of policy measures combating poverty. Chen Liangyu also used a variety of tools to ensure the welfare of the people of Shanghai, including improve pensions and health insurance and other social security programs, develop measures to increase active employees and retirees income, and increased employment opportunities. Chen Liangyu's attention and efforts on the issue of people's livelihood helped Shanghai society maintain harmony and stability, the average life expectancy exceeded 80 years of age, and members of the public felt a greater sense of belonging and pride with regard to being residents of Shanghai. Reform, innovation, and opening wider to world China pavilion at Expo 2010 One of the landmarks of the Shanghai World Expo China Pavilion Night Scene With Shanghai's economic development, the traditional model of development that relies on cheap labor and high energy consumption has become increasingly constrained further development. To this end, Chen Liangyu, Shanghai should improve the capability of independent innovation, economic growth by a \\"resource-dependent\\" to \\"innovation-driven\\".

These measures, so that the industrial structure of Shanghai's overall progress, and the formation and the gradual consolidation of the core competitiveness during Shanghai's economy has maintained double-digit growth, while energy consumption annual growth of only about 5%. In opening up, Chen Liangyu presided over planning the 2010 Shanghai World Expo ‚Äì the bid, construction and preparation work, to develop a number of measures to support the Shanghai bid to host the World Expo and then to attract countries to the stadium stationed in Shanghai World Expo of Governments, and during, exhibitors Affairs made significant progress, confirmed exhibitors for the number of countries and international organizations to create a historical record. Meanwhile, Chen Liangyu vigorously the introduction of foreign capital, and other means to expand the level of opening up in Shanghai, to improve Shanghai's international transparency, speed up Shanghai as an international metropolis, the pace of reconstruction. Cultural heritage and dialect protection Shanghai primary school in Professor Shanghai dialect Shanghai was known as the \\"lost culture Highland has a rich historical and cultural heritage, Chen Liangyu, that culture is the essence of a city, soul and lifeblood of focus on carrying forward the revival of Shanghai's specialty boutique culture and emphasis on the protection of historic buildings in Shanghai. In addition, from the beginning of the 1990s, Shanghai vigorously promote Mandarin, Shanghai dialect as the core of local culture (Shanghai culture) has become increasingly subject to compression, an increasingly grim situation. As the leadership of Shanghai, Chen Liangyu, on this issue to take a more flexible method is relatively effective protection of the local culture and the Shanghai dialect, the Shanghai public affirmation. Counterpart support and regional cooperation As the officials in charge of China's economic center Shanghai, Chen Liangyu advocate services nationwide, to support the economic construction of the other provinces and municipalities should be in the development of its own premise, in its term of office, the scale of foreign aid and economic cooperation expand personnel exchanges and mutual learning exchanges are becoming increasingly active. Controversy Along with Mayor Han Zheng, Chen continued the CPC's reformation, and during his leadership, Shanghai was selected as the host city for Expo 2010. Chen was officially credited with dramatically increasing the size and efficiency of Shanghai's public transportation. Shanghai's rising real estate prices have plagued the city since 2002, and rose over 200% during Chen's term in office as the city's Party Chief, as ordinary Shanghai citizens found it increasingly difficult to find a place to live. The real estate network had a history of being monopolized. The government had attempted to assert control, but because of the inevitable link between the government and private businesses, many deals were cut in which Chen was implicated. Chen also held major interests in the Shanghai Shenhua football squad, attending all of their home matches and even supervising some practices. His image in the city during his tenure as mayor was divisive. He initiated a series of gigantic projects to be finished in time for Shanghai's hosting of the 2010 World Exposition, including shipping 128,000 tons of sand to create a beach in Shanghai's suburbs, building a $209 million world-class tennis complex and a $300 million Formula One circuit racetrack. His most controversial project was the proposed Shanghai-Hangzhou mag-lev train. Opponents of Chen painted him as corrupt, short-tempered, and despotic during Municipal Committee meetings which he chaired. Supporters of Chen credited him with openness and saw him as a progressive leader crucial to Shanghai's economic and social development on the international scene. Other observers saw Chen as an effective local administrator in Shanghai, but an impediment to nationwide equalization and macroeconomic controls (otherwise known as ÂÆèËßÇË∞ÉÊéß Hongguan Tiaokong). During his term, Chen sold massive amounts of land to his brother who resold the land for more than tenfold, becoming Shanghai's real estate magnate.Times Online reports on Shanghai's property affairs Chen's son, Chen Weili, was made an executive of the Shanghai Shenhua football club shortly after graduating from university. Pension scandal In August 2006, Qin Yu, one of Chen's top aides, was abruptly dismissed from his position as Baoshan District governor, and arrested. Qin was charged with the misappropriation of $400 million of the city's pension funds. The city's social security coffers managed more than 10 billion yuan (US$1.25 billion) in assets. Instead of investing the money in low-risk government bonds and bank deposits, it was invested in expensive real estate and toll road projects around the city. It was suspected that the city's top leadership figures, including Chen, could be implicated in the scandal. During Chen's term as party chief, he routinely pursued policies that drew friction from the party's central leadership and the policies of the general secretary Hu Jintao. Hu's government favoured balanced regional economic development and feared social divisions resulting from a widening wealth gap, and thus attempted to rein in regional leaders who wanted to pursue rapid economic development which they viewed as overtly favoring regional economic interests. Chen reportedly clashed with Premier Wen Jiabao openly at a Politburo meeting in Beijing over the issue of economic development, indicating that Chen believed the Premier was standing in the way of China's economic development. Chen's statements at municipal meetings also charted a new independent course; Chen opposed the Communist Party's long-held convention that \\"Marxism serves as the guiding scientific principle.\\" Rather, Chen claimed to rely upon \\"all forms of science\\" ‚Äì signaling he was at odds with the Communist Party's orthodoxy. On September 25, citing alleged involvement in the pension scandal, Chen was dismissed as Shanghai party chief and suspended from his membership in the party's Central Committee and its Politburo. A team composed of some one hundred investigators from central authorities in Beijing was sent to Shanghai to investigate. Two days before his dismissal, Chen and mayor Han Zheng went to Beijing to meet with Hu Jintao. There Chen was detained, and only Han returned to Shanghai. The authorities carefully managed the transfer of authority in Shanghai. On the day of Chen's dismissal, Han Zheng returned to Shanghai at 3 am and called an official meeting to deliver Beijing's decision that Chen was suspended because of the scandal and that Han himself was assuming the post of acting party chief. Chen was charged with \\"helping further the economic interests of illegal business people\\", \\"protecting staff who severely violated laws and discipline\\" and \\"furthering the interests of family members by taking advantage of his official posts.\\" There was also speculation that Chen's sacking occurred for political reasons. Chen was a prot√©g√© of former general secretary Jiang Zemin and considered a core member of the Shanghai Clique. In carving out a local fiefdom for himself and willing to boldly deviate from the party's official economic policies, Chen was seen as a serious rival to general secretary Hu Jintao, and his dismissal was interpreted as a political victory for Hu. Chen was the highest-ranking Chinese official to be sacked since former Beijing party secretary Chen Xitong (no relation) was removed from office in 1994 on charges of corruption. The Shanghai pension scandal also led to the dismissal of the chief of the Municipal Labour and Social Security Bureau Zhu Junyi, and the downfall of several prominent businessmen, the executives of Shanghai's biggest industrial conglomerate, and other city officials.\\"Top Shanghai Leader Removed From Office\\". September 25, 2006. ABC News date=September 25, 2006title=Shanghai's Top Leader Is Dismissed, Linked to Pension Probework= Wall Street Journal For a period of time, it was also believed that the scandal would implicate the family and associates of then Vice-Premier and Politburo Standing Committee Huang Ju. However, Huang died in 2007, and no case against him was ever pursued. After Han Zheng served a few months as acting party chief, Zhejiang party chief Xi Jinping was transferred to Shanghai to take over the position of party secretary. Xi would go on to become a member of the Politburo Standing Committee in 2007 and General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in 2012. Expulsion and trial In July 2007, Chen was expelled from the Communist Party, and his case was transferred to judicial authorities. In comparison to the judicial action against Chen Xitong, Chen's case proceeded at a much faster pace. During the investigation, Chen was placed under house arrest in Qinhuangdao, where he lived in a mansion and spent most of his time playing cards and reading, ordering his meals from menus.Duowei: Chen handed to Judicial Authorities Thereafter, Chen was transferred to Qincheng Prison in the Changping District of Beijing. Chen's trial began in late March 2008. He was represented by Beijing lawyers Gao Zicheng and Liu Limu. He faced three charges: embezzlement, abuse of power, and dereliction of duty. Chen acknowledged that he was \\"partially responsible\\" for the pension fund scandal, but pleaded 'not guilty' to the charges. However, he was found guilty by the court. Chen was largely cooperative during the court proceedings. At the end of the trial on March 25, Chen stated \\"I am sorry to the party, the people of Shanghai, and my family\\".ÈôàËâØÂÆáÁöÑÊúÄÂêéÈôàËø∞Ôºö‰∏âÂ£∞ÂØπ‰∏çËµ∑ On April 11, 2008, Chen, 61, was sentenced to 18 years in prison for accepting 2.39 million yuan (~$340,000) in bribes and abusing power, specifically, for stock manipulation, financial fraud and his role in the city pension fund scandal, at the No. 2 Intermediate People's Court, Tianjin.

(Her full title used by monarchists was \\"Her Imperial Majesty, Empress Medferiashwork\\", but she was officially regarded in post-Derg Ethiopia as \\"Her Imperial Highness Princess Medferiashwork Abebe\\".)  Biography  Her father was Dejazmach and Major- General Abebe Damtew, so she was a niece of Ras Desta Damtew who was the first husband of her sister-in-law, Princess Tenagnework. She was thus a member of the aristocratic Adisge clan. Her mother was Woizero Wosenyelesh Mangasha, who in turn was daughter of Ras Bitwodad Mangasha Atikam of Damot and Agawmeder, Viceroy of Gojjam, who was a major figure during the reign of Emperor Menelik II, by his second wife Sifrash Bizu Yifru. Medferiashwork was thus a member of two of Ethiopia's most influential noble families. Empress Medferiashwork was the daughter-in-law of Emperor Haile Selassie. Medferiashwork Abebe Damtew married Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen Haile Selassie in 1945, and they had three daughters (Princess Maryam Senna, Princess Sehin Azebe and Princess Sifrash Bizu) and a son, Prince Zera Yacob. Princess Medferiashwork was said to have played a key role in organizing the opposition to the attempted 1960 coup against Emperor Haile Selassie. Her husband had been coerced into reading a radio statement declaring that he was to henceforth assume his father's throne as a \\"salaried monarch\\" and also announce far reaching political reforms. The Crown Princess was one of the few members of the Imperial family not placed under detention, and she played a role in getting the members of the nobility that had not been detained together with the leaders of the Army in order to crush the Imperial Guard which had launched the coup. In 1973, when her husband suffered a massive stroke, she accompanied him to Geneva, Switzerland where he was undergoing treatment. At this time, as the government in Ethiopia was faced with growing dissent, and the health of the Crown Prince was despaired of, the Prime Minister prevailed on the Emperor to name an \\"acting Crown Prince\\" or Heir Presumptive with the expectation that the Heir Apparent did not have long to live. Her son Zera Yacob was named Acting Crown Prince and Heir Presumptive by Emperor Haile Selassie, with the expectation that he would be named Crown Prince and Heir Apparent upon the expected death of his father. Instead, the Derg seized power and proclaimed her husband \\"King- designate\\", but as he refused to recognize this proclamation, the couple continued to use the titles and dignity of Crown Prince and Crown Princess. The Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen recovered sufficiently to allow the couple to move to London with their children where they lived in exile for over 15 years. In 1989, when Prince Asfaw Wossen assumed the title \\"Emperor-in-exile\\" with the name \\"Amha Selassie I\\", he bestowed the title of Empress upon Medferiashwork. Amha Selassie and Medferiashwork moved to the Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C. in 1990 to be near the large Ethiopian community there. Accorded courtesies and homage of an Empress-consort, Medferiashwork lived with her husband in Virginia until his death in February, 1997. She and her children accompanied his body back to Ethiopia and held Ethiopia's first royal funeral since the revolution. After her husband's death, she lived much more quietly, eventually settling in Addis Ababa. She attended the re-burial of her father-in-law Haile Selassie in November 2000, and the funeral of her sister- in-law and aunt by marriage, Princess Tenagnework in 2005. Medferiashwork died on March 13, 2009 after a long illness. In a departure from recent practice and in compliance with her wishes, Empress Medferiashwork was not entombed with other members of the Imperial family in the crypt of Holy Trinity Cathedral. Instead she was buried in the church yard of the cathedral alongside her mother in the section reserved for exiles of the Italian occupation. The Empress had lived in exile with her parents and sister in Jerusalem during the occupation of Ethiopia from 1936 to 1941.  Patronages  * Patroness of the Monastery of St. Mary at Gishen.

Professional football=1976 to 1978 seasons Pruitt was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the first round (seventh overall pick) of the 1976 NFL Draft. He remained with the Browns from 1976 to 1984. In his first two seasons with the Browns, Pruitt saw limited playing time as a backup to Greg Pruitt (no family relationship). In 1978, Pruitt became a starter mid-season. He started nine games at fullback and rushed for 560 yards and five touchdowns. Peak years: 1979 to 1983 Following a knee injury to Greg Pruitt, Pruitt had his breakout season in 1979 when he started all 16 games at fullback and had career highs with 1,294 rushing yards, 4.9 rushing yards per carry, and 1,666 yards from scrimmage.

Browns coach Sam Rutigliano said that, when Pruitt returned after a 57-day layoff resulting from the strike, he was \\"a shell of the guy\\" he had been and was not ready to play, \\"either mentally or physically.\\" In 1983, Pruitt compiled his fourth and final 1,000 yard rushing season.

It was later known as Monroe THE Calculator Company, and Monroe Division of Litton Industries. History Portrait of Jay Randolph Monroe In 1911, Jay Randolph Monroe first saw the Baldwin Calculator, the invention of Frank Stephen Baldwin. Although Mr. Baldwin's machine had been patented in 1874 and had been judged by the Franklin Institute as the most noteworthy invention of that year winning the John Scott Medal, it had not been developed for commercial use. Mr. Monroe recognized the merits of the Baldwin Calculator, and in April 1912 he organized the Monroe Calculating Machine Company, and in a small rented room near Newark, New Jersey, the manufacture of the first Monroe Adding-Calculator was begun. The following year the firm moved to Orange, New Jersey. The factory personnel consisted of only nine men and the entire heavy factory equipment was a lathe and two small presses. Even with these meager tools, tolerances were maintained to within thousandths of an inch to insure the accurate performance of the finished machine. The first Monroe was offered to the business world in 1914. In 1932, the company was awarded the Franklin Institute's John Price Wetherill Medal. For many years, Monroe was headquartered in Orange, New Jersey and Morris Plains, New Jersey with its manufacturing plants in New Jersey, Bristol, Virginia and Amsterdam. In 1958, the company was acquired by Litton Industries.The New York Times, January 24, 1958, p. 31. Litton sold it in 1984. In the mid-1980s, the company diversified and began carrying a line of private-labeled copiers (manufactured by Mita Corp.) and cross-cut paper shredders, but those items have been discontinued. In the 1970s and 1980s, the company had some 300 sales and service branch offices in the United States. In 1972, Monroe announced a pocket-sized electronic display calculator at $269.The Wall Street Journal, March 15, 1972, p. 40. As low cost electronic calculators from Japan became readily available through retail distribution, the mechanical calculator companies like Monroe, Friden, and Marchant declined even as they introduced programmable calculators. In 1980, the company name was changed to Monroe Systems for Business. This change in name was to reflect the diversification of the company from a calculator-only company to one which addressed the broader needs of the office. During this period, Monroe introduced bookkeeping machines, magnetic stripe ledger card accounting machines, programmable calculators, computers, copiers, facsimile and shredders. Since 2016, Monroe Systems for Business has been owned by Arlington Industries. Bill Ault serves as chief operating officer. As of 2019, in addition to calculators, the company has expanded the products it offers to include a number of complementary products for businesses and professionals with a focus on accounting functions ‚Äì this includes high-security shred solutions, currency counting machines, replacement toner cartridges, and more. In 2019, Monroe acquired Typewriters.com, a 61-year-old, all-in-one typewriter supplier who specializes in IBM, Nakajima and Brother reconditioned typewriters, as well as the supplies, parts and manuals that go with them. Founder, Jim Riegert, now leads the charge for sales, operations and customer service for the company. Also in 2019, Monroe became an Amazon channel partner.

It is located in the southeastern area of Caracas, and in the northwestern part of the State of Miranda. The seat of the municipal government is El Hatillo Town, founded in 1784 by Don Baltasar de Le√≥n, who was instrumental in the area's development. Although the town had its origins during the Spanish colonisation, the municipality was not established until 1991. In 2000 ‚Äì the year after a new constitution was enacted in Venezuela ‚Äì some of the municipality functions were delegated to a consolidated mayor's office called Alcald√≠a Mayor, which also has some authority over the other four municipalities of Caracas. El Hatillo preserves some of its colonial architecture, including an 18th-century parish church and a unique Romanian Orthodox Church. The municipality also has a rich artistic culture, with at least two important musical festivals celebrated yearly, and numerous holiday celebrations reflecting the heritage of El Hatillo. The culture, the pleasant temperature, the rural landscape, and the gastronomy of the municipality have made it a place of interest for visitors to the city, and a desirable place to live. The municipality receives a part of its income from tourism, an activity that is promoted by the government. Although commercial areas are growing rapidly, agriculture remains a foundation of the economy in the rural areas of the southern part of El Hatillo. The business sector remains mostly underdeveloped, causing heavy employee movement in and out of the municipality ‚Äì a problem that has made the transportation infrastructure of El Hatillo very congested. History In the 16th century, when the Spanish colonisation in the area began, El Hatillo was inhabited by the Mariches, an indigenous people possibly related to the Kalina (Caribs). Cacique Tamanaco was the leader of these tribes, known for resisting the Spanish colonisation. As the colonisation developed, the indigenous inhabitants were killed; by order of Caracas's founder Diego de Losada, Tamanaco was also murdered. A plaque in front of Baltasar's house describes how he donated land to construct El Hatillo Town (click to read translation). In 1752, Don Baltasar de Le√≥n Garc√≠aBaltasar is sometimes spelled Balthasar, Balthazar or Baltazar. arrived to El Hatillo from C√°diz, Spain, having just completed a prison term at La Carraca, Spain, for opposing (with his father) the monopoly rules of Guipuzcoana Company, which was in charge of maintaining exclusive trade between Spain and Venezuela. Don Baltasar founded El Hatillo Town, becoming one of the most significant contributors to its early development. Don Baltasar focused on making El Hatillo a strong, united and independent community, aiming to establish the area as a distinct parish from Baruta, on which El Hatillo depended. He accomplished this on June 12, 1784, when the governor and the bishop agreed to declare El Hatillo autonomous and under the direction of Don Baltasar, in front of 180 Canary-descendant families; this date is accepted as the foundation date of El Hatillo Town. That same year, Don Baltasar and his brother-in-law donated their properties to the town, and an engineer assisted in the urban planning, which included grid streets and a parish church. The church was built to honor Santa Rosal√≠a de Palermo, who Baltasar believed had saved him from a plague that killed his father in prison. In 1803, at the age of 79, Don Baltasar was unexpectedly killed in a horse accident. In 1809, landlord and Lieutenant Colonel Manuel Escalona achieved the separation of El Hatillo from Petare, another suburb of Caracas, making it a different Tenientazgo de Justicia ‚Äì a type of administrative division at the time. On April 19, 1810, Escalona enjoined the town to the movement of independence under Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, becoming another important person in the history of the municipality. Ana Francisca P√©rez Garc√≠a, Don Baltasar's wife, was a noteworthy woman in El Hatillo, attending to community children, elders and ill citizens. She donated a considerable amount of money for the construction of a hospital in Petare after the 1812 earthquake; this hospital is currently known as the P√©rez de Le√≥n de Petare Hospital. One of the most ambitious urbanisation projects in El Hatillo since its founding was the neighborhood called La Lagunita. In the 1950s and 1960s, La Lagunita S.A. constructed a \\"functional, futuristic and comfortable\\" residential zone. To encourage people to settle in the area, each parcel included a membership to Lagunita Country Club, which was officially opened in 1964. Brazilian landscape designer Roberto Burle Marx contributed to this project, constructed on the 4.3 million m¬≤ hacienda that once belonged to former Venezuelan president, Eleazar L√≥pez Contreras. La Lagunita has since become a wealthy neighborhood of El Hatillo. Although El Hatillo has been independent from Petare since 1809, it later became part of Sucre Municipality, where Petare is located. On November 19, 1991, Miranda's Legislative Assembly gave El Hatillo full autonomy, making it an independent municipality; this decision was issued in Gaceta Oficial on January 17, 1992. In 1993, Mercedes Hern√°ndez de Silva was elected the first mayor of El Hatillo. Since 2000, the Alcald√≠a Mayor manages some of the functions of the municipality. Geography Simulated- color Landsat 7 satellite image of El Hatillo and surrounding areas. El Hatillo Municipality lies at the southeast area of the city of Caracas and at the northwest corner of the State of Miranda; it is one of the state's 21 municipalities. El Hatillo is also within the jurisdiction of the Alcald√≠a Mayor, which has power over three adjacent municipalities of Miranda, and over Libertador Municipality in the Capital District. These five municipalities make up the city of Caracas. El Hatillo has a land size of ‚Äì the third largest municipality in the capital. The municipality's natural southern boundary is the Turgua range, spanning east to west and separating El Hatillo from the Baruta and Paz Castillo municipalities. Parallel to Turgua in the north is the Sabaneta range; the Prepo stream runs between the two ranges. North of the Sabaneta range, the Prepo stream feeds into the Tusmare stream, which ends in the Guaire river. Topographic map of El Hatillo. La Guairita stream flows into the Guaire in northeastern El Hatillo. The Guaire river is the eastern limit of the municipality, separating it from Sucre and Paz Castillo in the southeastern sector of El Hatillo. La Guairita serves as the northern boundary between El Hatillo and the municipalities of Baruta and Sucre. Limiting Baruta to the west, the boundaries of the municipality follow El Volc√°n, Pariagu√°n, La Mata and other peaks until they meet Turgua range in southeastern El Hatillo. The tallest peak in El Hatillo is Picacho de El Volc√°n (Spanish for \\"Peak of the Volcano\\"), at 1,490 meters (4,888 ft) above sea level, from where radio, television and telecommunication antennas serve Caracas. Despite its name, the mountain has had no recorded volcanic history. Other significant mountains in El Hatillo are Gavil√°n at , Topo de El Pauj√≠ at and Topo de Piedras Pintadas at . Environment Shops into the colonial houses El Hatillo, at a higher altitude than the neighboring municipalities of Caracas, has slightly cooler weather than nearby downtown Caracas. The average temperature is between 21 and 24 degrees Celsius (70‚Äì75 ¬∞F). At the highest elevations, the temperature can decrease to 18 ¬∞C (64 ¬∞F) and the atmosphere may have constant fog. The mean precipitation is 997.3 millimeters a year (39 inches); annual values can range from 800 to 1,500 millimeters (32 in to 59 in). The average humidity index is 75%; similar to the rest of Venezuela, the rainy season is May through November, while all other months are considered the dry season. The winds are north aliz√© trade winds. Concentrated near water bodies, the vegetation in most of El Hatillo is dense forests, occupying around 30% of the surface. Smaller plants like shrubs take around 9% and herbs occupy a similar percentage. In 1972, the forests of El Hatillo were declared a protected zone of the metropolitan area of Caracas. The municipality is home to a wide range of bird species, with more than two hundred registered, including sparrowhawks, eagles, falcons, and owls. Birdwatching in the area is promoted by the authorities of Miranda, who have also supported conservation of these species. Demographics Projected population growth chart based on 2001 data. In the 16th century, the indigenous Mariches were killed by the explorers; when the development of El Hatillo began, Spaniards from the Canary Islands settled in the area. Families from Madeira, Portugal also immigrated to El Hatillo, working largely in agriculture in La Uni√≥n neighborhood. As of 2001, 86% of the inhabitants of El Hatillo were born in Venezuela; the largest group not born in Venezuela was from Colombia with 4.2% of the population, followed by Spain with 2.0%, Italy with 1.0%, the United States with 1.0%, and Portugal with 0.8%. In the 2001 National Institute of Statistics census, El Hatillo Municipality had 54,225 inhabitants, but demographics show a rapidly rising population. With the progressive demographic increase, El Hatillo's population is no longer exclusive to any particular ethnic group. In 2001 there were 997 births in El Hatillo, equivalent to a rate of 18.4 births per one thousand citizens. The death rate for that same year was 2.9 per one thousand citizens. 2001 data shows that there is an average of 21.3 years of potential life lost. The main cause of death according to 1999 data was cancer, followed by heart disease and murder. Population pyramid for El Hatillo Municipality based on data from 2000. Data for 2000 shows that the largest age group to be 15- to 19-year-olds, representing 9.5% of El Hatillo's population; for every 100 females there are 94.2 males. The unemployment rate in 2001 was 6.1%, ranking fourth lowest among the twenty-one municipalities in Miranda. As of 2001, there were 18,878 homes in El Hatillo, of which 13,545 were occupied; the remaining homes were either unoccupied, occasionally used, under construction, or for sale. An average of four people made up each household. Regarding wealth, 74.7% of the population were above poverty level, 21.5% were poor, and 3.8% were extremely poor. According to the 2001 census, each household in the municipality received an average of 1,316,906 Venezuelan bol√≠vares (1316.906 bol√≠vares fuertes) per month, equal to US$1,832 at the time, or US$21,984 per year. Based on a June 29, 2001 exchange rate of Bs.719/US$1 Neighborhoods Although there are no defined limits for the neighborhoods of El Hatillo, the government website divides the municipality into urban and rural. Concentrated in the northern region of the municipality, the urban neighborhoods are El Hatillo Town, El Calvario, La Lagunita, Alto Hatillo, La Boyera, Las Mar√≠as, Oripoto, Los Pomelos, Los Naranjos, Los Geranios, La Caba√±a, Cerro Verde, Llano Verde, Colinas, Vista El Valle, Los Olivos, and El Cigarral. The rural localities of the municipality are located in southern El Hatillo; these are La Uni√≥n, Corralito, Turgua, La Hoyadita, Sabaneta, La Mata, Caicaguana, and Altos de Halc√≥n. Economy Paseo El Hatillo shopping mall. The economy of El Hatillo Municipality consists of three sectors: the commercial sector, which has been growing along with the population increase and is primarily represented by shopping malls and retail stores around the urban areas most of which sell typical crafts of the country; agricultural, in the southern half of the municipality and existing since the founding of El Hatillo; and tourism, which contributes significantly to El Hatillo's income and is promoted by the government. El Hatillo is an accessible day visit destination for people from Caracas; the municipality is only southeast of downtown Caracas but in the mountains removed from the congested Caracas valley;Dydynski (2004), p. 73. thus, development has focused on day tourism. The central town square ‚Äì Plaza Bol√≠var ‚Äì and its surroundings are well maintained, and the municipal government offers bus trips around the narrow streets for viewing the colonial architecture of the town. Handcrafted souvenirs and products are popular purchases, offered at local artisan shops, and there are numerous restaurants.Dydynski (2004), p. 58. There are at least three cultural centers in the municipality that attract tourists and residents to music festivals and art expositions. To support the increasing population, numerous shopping malls have been built in the municipality. Neighborhoods like La Lagunita, Los Naranjos and El Hatillo Town now offer large scale shopping malls with multiplex movie theaters. Since the 1980s, the older typical houses of El Hatillo Town have been converted to shops and restaurants, while preserving their colonial architecture. Employment possibilities within El Hatillo ‚Äì a bedroom community of Caracas ‚Äì are reduced; businesses in the municipality are almost strictly commercial, and the economy has not expanded in other directions. Office space underdevelopment has resulted from a lack of land for large scale office construction, making it costly to locate large offices or businesses in the area. Those seeking employment in offices or larger businesses must look outside of El Hatillo, contributing to the high traffic to, from, and in El Hatillo. Law and government Seal of Alcald√≠a El Hatillo, the mayor's office. El Hatillo City Hall Venezuelan law specifies that municipal governments have four main functions: executive, legislative, comptroller, and planning. The executive function is managed by the mayor, who is in charge of representing the municipality's administration. The legislative branch is represented by the Municipal Council, composed of seven councillors, charged with the deliberation of new decrees and local laws. The comptroller tasks are managed by the municipal comptroller's office, which oversees accountancy. Finally, planning is represented by the Local Public Planning Council, which manages development projects for the municipality. El Hatillo has had five mayors through 2014. Mercedes Hern√°ndez de Silva was the first mayor of the municipality, serving from 1993 until 1996. Succeeding her, Flora Aranguen was Mayor from 1996 until 2000. That same year, Alfredo Catal√°n was elected mayor and reelected in 2004. On November 23, 2008 Myriam Do Nascimento was elected mayor. She served in that capacity until 2013, when David Smolansky succeeded her as mayor. The 2007 president of the Municipal Council is Leandro Pereira, supported by the political party Justice First. All but one of the seven councillors belong to political parties opposed to President Hugo Ch√°vez's administration. There is also a Legislative Commission, presided over by councillor Salvador Pirrone in 2007. The commission's job is to assist the municipality in legal matters, such as the creation of new laws and decrees. On March 8, 2000 ‚Äì the year after a new constitution was introduced in Venezuela ‚Äì it was decreed that the Metropolitan District of Caracas would be created, and that some of the powers of El Hatillo Municipality would be delegated to the Alcald√≠a Mayor, which would also govern the Baruta, Libertador, Sucre and Chacao municipalities. Each of the five municipalities is divided into parishes; El Hatillo has only one, the Santa Rosal√≠a de Palermo Parish, sometimes called Santa Rosal√≠a de El Hatillo Parish or simply El Hatillo Parish. In December 2006, as a part of a constitutional reform, Ch√°vez proposed a reorganisation of the municipal powers. Ch√°vez mentioned his reform plans again in his January 2007 presidential inauguration, suggesting a new form of subdivision‚Äîcommunal cities‚Äîin which mayors and municipalities would be replaced by communal powers. Crime Relative to the other Caracas municipalities,Venezuela's capital ‚Äì Caracas ‚Äì has become South America's most violent. The United Nations reported in 2005 that Venezuela had the highest number of deaths by gunfire per capita in the world, garnering for Venezuela claim to the title of the world's most violent crime capital. \\"Venezuela: Crimes and misdemeanours.

Washington Post (2006-05-10), p. A17. Retrieved on 2006-06-24. El Hatillo has the region's lowest crime rate. Data from 2003 shows that 53,555 crimes occurred within the five municipalities of Caracas, but only 418 (about 0.78%) took place within El Hatillo. El Hatillo's population is significantly lower than that of its sister municipalities; viewing 2003 crime data relative to 2001 census data, El Hatillo had an annual rate of 7.7 crimes for every one thousand citizens, while the average of the five Caracas municipalities was 19.4 for every one thousand citizens. The main police force in El Hatillo is the municipal police, sometimes referred to as Poli-Hatillo. Other police forces can also intervene in the municipality, including the Metropolitan Police, and the Miranda State Police. Education Nueva Esparta University, the only higher education institution in El Hatillo. The municipality has one higher education facility ‚Äì Nueva Esparta University, a 30,000 square meters (323,000 sq ft) institution located in Los Naranjos. Nueva Esparta school was founded in 1954, but the private university was not constructed until 1989. El Hatillo offers free public education, with a total of seventeen primary education schools; eleven are public and six are private. Nineteen preschools exist: ten public and nine private. Data for secondary education is incomplete; there are five private secondary schools in the municipality, but the number of public secondary schools is unavailable. Government data shows each educational stage separately, but an individual facility may contain preschool, primary and secondary education. The 2001 census shows enrollment of 8,525 students during the 2000‚Äì2001 school year; by the end of the school year, 8,149 had passed. * Culture The most significant icon in the culture of El Hatillo is Santa Rosal√≠a de Palermo. The church adjacent to the plaza in the center block of El Hatillo Town is named after this saint, and the only parish in the municipality also carries her name. The community is largely Catholic; local shops carry many religious handcrafted products, and the municipality is the site of the Santa Rosa de Lima Seminary, formerly San Jos√© Seminary. In El Hatillo ‚Äì and throughout Venezuela ‚Äì images of Jesus and Mary are part of the art and culture. Don Baltasar de Le√≥n and his wife, Ana Francisca, are remembered for founding and developing El Hatillo. Manuel Escalona is recognised for including El Hatillo in the 19th century independence movement; as in the rest of Venezuela, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var is considered a hero. Heritage Sculpture of Santa Rosal√≠a de Palermo, inside the church named after her. Brought to El Hatillo from Spain by Don Baltasar. Santa Rosal√≠a de Palermo ‚Äì born in Palermo, Italy ‚Äì is the patron saint of El Hatillo. Rosal√≠a was recognised in 1624 when her remains were discovered in a cave, brought to the Cathedral of Palermo, and displayed through the streets of Palermo during a plague. Within three days, the plague ended; Rosal√≠a was credited with saving many from the plague and proclaimed patron saint of the city.Ferlita, Kenneth C. (1997) Santa Rosalia. Retrieved on 2006-12-15. Years later, El Hatillo's founder also believed that Santa Rosal√≠a had protected him from an infection. During the Guipuzcoana scandal in Venezuela, Baltasar's father, Juan Francisco de Le√≥n, and his sons were held prisoners in C√°diz. Juan Francisco died as a consequence of smallpox, but Don Baltasar completed his years in prison and then moved to El Hatillo. Baltasar brought the legacy of Santa Rosal√≠a de Palermo to El Hatillo, believing she protected him from the pestilence that killed his father in C√°diz. Part of El Hatillo's culture has grown around Santa Rosal√≠a; she is believed to be the one who takes care of the people and protects El Hatillo from any pandemic that could hit the area. Don Baltasar's most evident inclusion of Rosal√≠a into El Hatillo's culture occurred at least twice: first in 1776, when El Calvario chapel was built and dedicated to the Saint; and then in 1784, when a bigger parish church named Iglesia Santa Rosal√≠a de Palermo was constructed. Regional celebrations In addition to the nationwide activities celebrating Christmas, the New Year, Carnival, and Easter, El Hatillo has a number of celebrations unique to the region. Since the 1766 founding of El Hatillo, a week-long festival honoring Santa Rosal√≠a de Palermo (Spanish: Fiestas Patronales en honor a Santa Rosal√≠a de Palermo) is held in September featuring parades, Catholic masses, and traditional games, concluding with the traditional release of balloons accompanied by fireworks. On Holy Thursday, an image of the crucified Christ is decorated with flowers and paraded around El Hatillo's Plaza Bol√≠var in the Jesus Christ Procession. Since 1938, Carnival has been celebrated in El Hatillo with dancing, parades, and the election of a Carnival Queen in Plaza Bol√≠var. The founding of El Hatillo is commemorated on June 12 with organised activities including traditional games, mass, and balloons. A tradition having religious and agricultural significance has been celebrated every May since the beginning of the twentieth century. The third Sunday of May is the festival of Dama anta√±ona, in which residents pay homage to the women of El Hatillo, with typical food and gifts. Art Bol√≠var Square, the heart of El Hatillo. The Cultural and Social Center El Hatillo, El Hatillo Art Center, and El Hatillo Atheneum are the local centers of artistic activity. In 2006, Dave Samuels inaugurated the annual International Music Festival of El Hatillo at the El Hatillo Art Center; Samuels was followed by Sim√≥n D√≠az, Steve Smith, Serenata Guayanesa, Mike Stern and other notable musicians. Since 1999, the El Hatillo Jazz Festival has attracted visitors to the municipality to hear national and foreign jazz artists. El Hatillo's art culture is rich with handcrafted products. Pottery is a common souvenir for tourists, and there are many artisans devoted to ceramics and pottery in the municipality. The Turgua Group is an artist collective of almost twenty potters and blacksmiths, founded in 1992 by Guillermo Cuellar, an internationally known potter.Cornell College (Dec. 20, 2002). Cornell hosts exhibition by Venezuelan potter, alumnus Guillermo Cuellar. Press Release Archive, 2002‚Äì2003. Retrieved on 2006-12-15 The group has two exhibitions a year, which have expanded from pottery exposition to jewelry, photography, woodwork, drawing and weaving. In May 2005, the local government collaborated with the Japanese Embassy to organise Japan Cultural Week, an exposition held in the Art Center featuring bonsai, origami, kimonos, martial arts, anime and other manifestations of the Japanese culture. The event offered free workshops for learning these Japanese arts. Continuing cultural promotion in the municipality, the III Sal√≥n de Fotograf√≠a El Hatillo ‚Äì a photography contest for children, amateur and professional photographers ‚Äì was organised in October 2005. Cuisine Churros with chocolate. The cuisine industry in El Hatillo has grown along with the commercial development of the municipality. A September 2006 article in Estampas ‚Äì a weekly Venezuelan magazine ‚Äì described the culinary arts of El Hatillo, noting that El Hatillo offers the usual Venezuelan table, as well as new gastronomic developments. The TV chef Yuraima Blanco opened the Culinary Art Gallery in El Hatillo, where diners can enjoy a variety of food. There are also typical cachapa restaurants and caf√©s, as well as other restaurants with a fusion of foreign and national food. According to Estampas, a well-known local restaurant called \\"Mauricio's\\" mixes Swiss and French food with Caribbean gastronomy. El Hatillo also offers many varieties of confectionery, such as churros, pastry and ice cream. There are a variety of other restaurants in El Hatillo, offering such diverse cuisine as German and Thai food.Dydynski (2004), p. 85. Sports Lagunita Country Club is one of the most important sports facilities in the municipality. The club offers tennis and swimming, but it is best known for its golf course, the home of the 1974 WGC-World Cup. Designed by Dick Wilson, the club began with temporary headquarters in 1959, opening officially in 1964. Lagunita Country Club played an important role in the development of La Lagunita neighborhood ‚Äì an ambitious urban project, which has become one of the wealthiest areas of Caracas. Hipari√≥n is another club located in El Hatillo; according to the Venezuelan Census of Cultural Heritage, this equestrian facility from the 1930s was originally used for horse trips, but it later became a place for the training and caring of horses. The Club Hipari√≥n is internationally known for its equestrian training. Located at the highest point of the Municipality lies El Volcan, a small mountain of about 1500 meters from sea level. This mountain has a Downhill course that has about 500 meters of vertical drop, it is used by hundreds of riders a day during dry and wet weather, mostly on weekends. The course is open to the public and riding is neither specifically allowed nor prohibited by law. The trails are also used by hikers all week long. Shuttles are about 10 Venezuelan bolivars per trip, they run from the parking lot of a Farmatodo drug store in La Boyera, up to the summit using public avenues and paved roads, taking from 15 minutes to 30 minutes depending on traffic on the area. The course apart from being used mostly for recreational purpose, also has been used for irregularly scheduled downhill races due to the lack of organisation in the riders community. Tourism and recreation The hub of activity in El Hatillo Town is Bol√≠var Plaza (Spanish: Plaza Bol√≠var), a garden square encompassing the central block in the town of El Hatillo. Constructed in 1785, the Plaza was originally called Plaza Mayor or Plaza del Mercado. In 1911, a bust honoring Manuel Escalona was placed in the square, which was renamed in his honor. In 1952, the bust was replaced with a statue of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, and the plaza was again renamed after the Venezuelan hero. Across from the Bol√≠var Square is the 18th century Santa Rosal√≠a de Palermo Church, which was declared a National Historic Monument in 1960. The statue of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, erected in 1952, replaced the one of Manuel Escalona. Between El Hatillo and La Lagunita is the smaller Manuel Escalona Plaza (Spanish: Plazoleta Manuel Escalona), another urban monument displaying the bust of Escalona that formerly occupied Bol√≠var Square. Sucre Plaza (Spanish: Plaza Sucre) ‚Äì graced since 1915 with a ceiba tree at its center ‚Äì is in the southern part of town; this was historically where people tied their mules while frequenting The Four Corners, and it is also known as Plaza La Ceiba. The Four Corners (Spanish: Las Cuatro Esquinas) was a convenient social gathering spot in El Hatillo, comprising a general store, hardware shop, gambling place and bar. La Lagunita is the site of the San Constantino and Santa Elena Romanian Orthodox Church. The building is an architectural work from the 16th century, brought from Romania, made completely from oak and fir woods, and detailed with more than 40,000 individually placed and carved tiles. It is one of only 15 churches of its type remaining in the world, and one of only two outside of Romania, the other being in Switzerland. For children, the Caicaguana hacienda in La Lagunita houses the Expanzoo, where visitors can see and touch exotic animals. The zoo is recognised for offering unique employment opportunities; the workers are from families with few resources, and the staff include the mentally ill. The Baby Zoo is another place for children to interact with animals; visitors can feed and touch the animals, ride horses and rent the location for special events. More interaction with nature can be experienced by visiting the Morro la Guairita park in El Cafetal ‚Äì commonly known as the Indian Caves (Spanish: Cuevas del Indio) ‚Äì a system of 22 natural openings in the mountain, and the only place in Caracas where rock climbing is permitted. Guided tours are available, and views of El √Åvila can be enjoyed while ascending the park. Transportation A traditional street with colonial houses. The mountainous terrain and geographic features of El Hatillo have made it difficult to extend the Caracas Metro to southeast Caracas, so the main transportation methods in the municipality are private vehicles and road public transportation. An extension of the Metro ‚Äì Line 5 ‚Äì has been proposed, but construction has not been initiated as of 2007; phase 2 of Line 4 is still under construction. Urban planning in the municipality has been unorganised; news archives show that at least since 1998, neighbors have been complaining about the dense traffic caused by new residential and commercial construction, yet new or enhanced alternative roads to resolve the traffic problems have not been completed. A south beltway suggested 25 years ago has not been constructed due to its high cost. However, as of January 2006, a new route that will connect La Lagunita with Macaracuay ‚Äì a neighborhood in northeast Caracas ‚Äì is under construction and is planned to be completed in 2010; according to Mayor Catal√°n, 23% of El Hatillo's inhabitants will eventually use this transit way. Its cost was estimated in early 2006 as US$19,572,000. Local solutions ‚Äì such as the proposed Metro extension line and the road connecting La Lagunita and Macaracuay ‚Äì may improve the traffic congestion around El Hatillo, but the traffic issue affects all of Caracas. It is estimated that one million vehicles transit Caracas daily, causing a collapse of the transportation network. Automobiles travel at an average speed of 15 km/h (9 mph) on the streets and highways of Caracas. There are numerous factors contributing to the traffic problem in Caracas. According to the Venezuelan Society of Transportation Engineers, a city should allocate 20% of its public area to transportation; in Caracas, less than 12% is allocated. In 2004, fifty thousand new vehicles were sold in Caracas. In 2005, sixty thousand more were sold, and as of November, 2006, seventy thousand more had been sold. In five years, 250 thousand more cars are circulating in Caracas on roadways that have not increased proportionally to the increase in the number of cars. Further, public transportation is not fully reliable; an average trip in the city using mass transit takes around ninety minutes.

Born into the prominent Sydney trading family, Hordern directed the family company of Anthony Hordern & Sons from 1909 to 1926. Early years Samuel Hordern was born on 24 September 1876 at Retford Hall, Darling Point in Sydney, the eldest son of Samuel Hordern and Jane Maria Booth. His father was the grandson of Anthony Hordern I, who established the eponymous store as a drapery shop in 1823, and his mother was the daughter of prominent Sydney produce merchant and later Alderman, John Booth. Educated at Sydney Grammar School and Bath College in England, Hordern returned to Sydney in 1895 to take up employment in the family business. On 4 March 1900, Hordern married Charlotte Isabel Annie See, daughter of Premier Sir John See, at St Jude's Anglican Church, Randwick and they would have one son and two daughters. In the same month, Hordern purchased the 1890 Federation Arts & Crafts house, \\"Tuxedo\\", in Albert Road, Strathfield, which became the family's residence until July 1914 when Hordern sold it for ¬£3500. Anthony Hordern & Sons On the death of his father in August 1909, in accordance with his father's will, Hordern took over management of the family company, which employed more than 4000 people in its store and mail-order business and imported, manufactured and sold a vast range of merchandise. In 1910, Hordern purchased the 1837 Darling Point mansion, \\"Mount Adelaide\\", from the family of Henry Mort, and commissioned architects Morrow & De Putron to design and build a Federation Arts & Crafts mansion, which he named \\"Babworth House\\" and which became his family's primary residence from 1915 until his death in 1956. Hordern publicly listed the company in 1912 and restructured it in 1920. Hordern retired from the business in 1926, when he sold it to a public limited liability company for the sum of AU¬£2,900,000, described at the time as the \\"largest business sale that has ever taken place in the history of Australia\\". Later career and philanthropy He was a keen cattle, dog and horse breeder, and owner of racehorses, including the 1919 Melbourne Cup winner 'Artilleryman'. Hordern was knighted in 1919, received the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal (1935) and the King George VI Coronation Medal (1937), and was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1938 Birthday Honours. Hordern was president of the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales (1915-1941) and developed the Sydney Royal Easter Show into a major national event. Prominent in the Sydney Chamber of Commerce and many other business associations, he was a director of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, president of the Master Retailers' Association, and chairman of the Australian Mutual Provident Society (1932‚Äì1947). On 1 December 1917 Hordern purchased on behalf on an interested group of benefactors, the former vice- regal residence, Cranbrook in Bellevue Hill, from the Government of New South Wales for a Church of England boys' school and contributed towards the establishment in 1926 of a Church of England girls' school in the same area: Kambala School. He was a director of Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (1913‚Äì1939) and served as chairman of the hospital board in 1933‚Äì1934. Later life and legacy The Hordern Pavilion at the Sydney Showgrounds was built in 1924 to commemorate the Hordern family business and Hordern's long-standing role as president of the Royal Agricultural Society. Cape Hordern (originally \\"Hordern Island\\") in Antarctica was named after him by Douglas Mawson of the 1911‚Äì1914 Australasian Antarctic Expedition to honour his philanthropic support of the expedition. Hordern died age 79 on the same day as his sister, Jane, at his Darling Point residence, \\"Babworth House\\", on 3 June 1956. Following his death in 1956 the contents of Babworth House were sold at auction and the mansion was sold to a trust to become a hospital.

The Sikhs reconstructed the fort after capturing Peshawar in March 1823. In 1849, the British East India Company reconstructed the fort's outer walls.

In 1834, the Sikhs named the fort as Samƒ´r Ga·πõh or Sameer Garh.

During the times of the Mughal Empire and Sur Empire, it was known as \\"Bagram Fort\\" after Bagram, another name for Peshawar.Fort Bala Hisar - Peshawar. 3 July 2005. Khyber.ORG.  Design  The fort stands on a high mound in the northwestern corner of Peshawar City. Not long ago, the fort used to be conspicuously away from the old city of Peshawar, but now the construction of new buildings has covered space between the old city and the fort. However, the fort's position on a high mound gives a commanding and panoramic view of Peshawar and the entire Peshawar valley.  History  According to historian Ahmad Hasan Dani, a Chinese Buddhist monk and traveller Xuanzang, when visiting Peshawar in 630 AD, found a \\"royal residence\\" and called it with Chinese word Kung Shing, which is used for its significance and is explained as fortified or walled portion of the town in which the royal palace stood. Hiuen Tsang then makes a separate mention of the city, which was not fortified. This shows that the royal residence formed the nucleus of a Citadel, which must have been further protected by a moat. Dani further says that a channel of old Bara River surrounded by a high spot, which includes the Bala Hissar and Inder Shahr. The higher area could have been the citadel, which is the present Bala Hissar. The fort pre-existed the Mughal Emperor Babur, who referred to it as Bagram Fort. The fort was used as a royal residence for the Durrani Empire since December 1747, when Ahmad Shah Durrani conquered Peshawar. The Afghan King Timur Shah Durrani (1773‚Äì1793) used the fort as the winter capital of his empire. Up to the early 19th century, Peshawar was the winter capital of the Afghan Empire, and the Bala Hissar was the royal residence of Afghan kings. The Sikhs fought and defeated the Afghans in the Battle of Nowshera near Peshawar in March 1823. The Sikhs followed this by the destruction of the Afghan royal court and the Bala Hissar in Peshawar.Moorcroft, W. and G. Trebeck. (1841). Travels in India. ed.

In three years at Iowa State, Morgan had a combined record of 55-39, marking his record fourth to Larry Eustachy (72-26, two NCAA tournament appearances, one Elite eight appearance), Tim Floyd (69-29, twice second round of NCAA tourney), and Fred Hoiberg (62-39, two round of 32 NCAA tournament appearances) in the history of Iowa State University basketball coaches finishing their third year. During this time his team went to the NIT semifinals and the second round of the NCAA tournament, where they were overpowered by the eventual national champions, North Carolina. Morgan's third year, struggling to rebuild the four and five positions, was less spectacular, finishing with a 16-14 record overall. He was fired by athletic director Jamie Pollard in March 2006 due to an emerging scandal in which Iowa State University allegedly paid a third party, D1 Scheduling, money which was linked to a cash-for-recruits program. Investigations by NCAA, conferences and schools found no wrongdoing.Brett McIntyre, \\"Scandal engulfs Iowa State; Officials Deny Wrongdoing\\" Morgan was replaced by Greg McDermott, a native Iowan, and head coach of the University of Northern Iowa. His up-tempo style of basketball generated doubt across the state but produced a memorable first season that featured a team which was playing its best basketball late in the season. ISU recorded 20 wins in Morgan's rookie season, tying for the ninth- best win total in school history. The 20 wins produced by Morgan, which is the second-best win total for an ISU coach in his first season at the helm, was just one of several highlights in his inaugural season. The Cyclones were virtually unbeatable at home, going 17-1 in Hilton Coliseum. The 17 home wins was the second-highest home win tally in school history and the 94.4 percent home winning percentage is the fifth-best clip in the ISU annals. Three of ISU's 17 home wins were against teams that advanced to the NCAA Sweet Sixteen (Xavier, Kansas, Texas) and two were against instate rivals Iowa and Drake, helping ISU win its second consecutive mythical state championship. Morgan paced ISU to a NIT appearance, the school's 14th postseason bid in the last 21 years. The Cyclones caught fire in the NIT, defeating Georgia, Florida State and Marquette, earning a trip to New York City in the semifinals at Madison Square Garden. One of Morgan's star players in his first season was Curtis Stinson, a fellow New Yorker who he recruited to ISU in his first season as an assistant with the Cyclones. Stinson was one of the best freshman in all of college basketball, earning Big 12 Freshman of the Year honors and first-team Freshman All-America accolades by Basketball Times. Stinson and Jackson Vroman both earned third-team all-Big 12 honors in Morgan's first year. Vroman led the league in rebounding, becoming the first Cyclone to top the conference in boards since 1980. Morgan helped Vroman develop into one of the best centers in the nation in his final season with the Cyclones. His improvement enabled him get drafted in the second round of the 2004 NBA Draft as the No. 31 pick. Morgan was tabbed as Iowa State University's 17th men's basketball coach May 14, 2003. He spent his first season in Ames as an assistant at Iowa State, joining the ISU basketball staff in July 2002. As an assistant on the 2002-03 Cyclone staff, Morgan helped ISU to an NIT berth, as ISU finished 17-14, tying for the 13th-best win total in school history. A top-notch recruiter, he was instrumental in helping the Cyclones sign a nationally ranked recruiting class in 2003 and 2004. Morgan was involved in 12 NCAA Tournaments, seven regular- season conference titles, four NIT appearances and tutored nineteen players who have gone on to NBA careers. He spent six years as head coach at Long Beach State, where he compiled a 91-84 overall mark and a 55-39 record in the Big West Conference before he was fired. Morgan coached three teams that finished first or second in the Big West Western Division. His 1999-2000 squad was 24-6 overall and 15-1 in the Big West en route to winning the conference championship. The 1999-2000 team was one of the best in LBSU history, qualifying for the National Invitation Tournament. It compiled the third- longest winning streak in school history (15 games), tied for the third-most wins in 49er history. Morgan is also a 2008 inductee into the Westchester Community College Hall of fame as well as a 2018 inductee into the Brooklyn USA Basketball Hall of Fame. From 2009-2013, Morgan was an assistant coach at Hofstra University. He is the author of two DVDs: Wayne Morgan: Mastering the 2-3 zone defense; and Wayne Morgan: The Philosophy of changing defenses and the 2-3 zone. Both feature his mastery of the 2-3 zone, much of what he learned as an assistant to Coach Jim Boeheim of Syracuse between 1984 and 1996.

Born in Cap-Ha√Øtien in 1934, she left Haiti at an early age to pursue her acting studies abroad. Her career started in theatre with the company Les Griots, of which she was a founding member in 1956. Griots was at the vanguard of n√©gritude-inspired cultural institutions in France, and was the first African theatre company in Paris. The Griots was the troupe that gave the first performance of Jean Genet's play \\"The Blacks.\\" She also worked with the playwright Samuel Beckett and the director Roger Blin and acted in several films. With a groundbreaking performance in 1973 at La vieille grille in Paris, Toto Bissainthe established herself as singer- songwriter-composer, stunning the audience with her soul-stirring renditions of original compositions that paid homage to the lives, struggles, miseries and spirituality of working class and rural Haitians. The singer and actress Toto Bissainthe was recognized by many as a champion of Haitian music abroad. An artist in exile, Toto Bissainthe will be unable to return to the Haiti that so inspired her until the departure of Jean-Claude Duvalier in 1986. However, the multiple disappointments of the unending democratic transition and political infighting would forever embitter the outspoken artist, who had long dreamed of a return to help rebuild her motherland. Saddened by Haiti's social and political degradation, Toto Bissainthe's health would enter a downward spiral ending with her death from liver damage on June 4, 1994. The cause was cirrhosis, her family said.  Theatre  Toto Bissainthe studied acting in France where she founded The Griots with Roger Blain. This was the first black theatre company in France. Some of the plays titled in French included Papa bon Dieux, Les negres, Negres, negres, L‚Äôombre de la ravine, and L‚Äôinvite de Pierre, among others. She also had some roles in film, including Les tripes au soleil and En l‚Äôautre bord . She began singing in 1962, after a return to Haiti. ‚ÄúBecause in my family, we always loved singing and I missed it. I started a little bit by chance: in a hotel‚Ä¶and on that evening I remember that I sang a song‚Äù. She continued singing at that hotel once a week for three to four months in French and in Haitian Creole.Chansons sans Fronti√®res.

Toto was constantly praised in the media for her music. In a 1967 Haitian newspaper, a journalist wrote the following praising her album: > Toto Bissainthe will, at the very least, have the merit of having introduced > through song to Haiti, a way that is only reserved to a minority.

Toto Bissainthe was very often lauded for being a singer representing the black diaspora. In a newspaper clip from the year 1980, there‚Äôs an article titled Toto Bissainthe: The Sortileges of the Black diaspora which states, ‚ÄúHer creation has for ambition to refer to a lost freedom that has yet to be found.

She then added ‚ÄúAll of the people that I love, I would tell them what I want, against the government and all that, and [the government] wouldn‚Äôt find that worrisome because they know that the people don‚Äôt speak French‚Ä¶still that can still give some consciousness to some. But as soon as I would sing in creole, I would make more impact and they immediately banned me‚Äù (Translate from French) (Catala). She went on to give a concert less than 2 months before the fall of the Duvalier regime at the Rex Theatre. At this concert she told people her message of justice, hope, love, life and revolt.

It is bordered by Feltonville, Juniata and Frankford to the north, Fairhill to the west, West Kensington and Kensington to the south, and Port Richmond and Bridesburg to the east. History Harrowgate was founded in 1784 by Capt. George Esterly, a Revolutionary War veteran, when he discovered springs in the vicinity of what is now Kensington Ave. and Tioga St., now the site of Harrowgate Square, a park covering one city block. The spring water was pronounced healthful by Dr. Benjamin Rush, and Esterly established a spa there, with gardens, overnight accommodations, food and drink, occasional concerts, and coach service from Second and Market Sts. in Philadelphia. The name was copied from a spa in England. The spring dried up about 1800, but the town flourished. Nearby was Cedar Grove, country estate of the Paschall and Morris families. First section of the modest mansion was built in 1746. The Morris family donated the house to the city in 1926, and it was moved, stone by stone, with much of the original furniture, to west Fairmount Park, where it is open to the public. Historically, Harrowgate was a working-class community whose residents could trace their ancestry to England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. Demographics As of the 2010 Census, Harrowgate was 48.5% Hispanic, 34.5% non Hispanic white, 10% black, 4.1% Asian, and 2.9% all other. Today, Harrowgate is primarily a low-income neighborhood largely populated by Puerto Ricans. But also has significant Polish, Irish, Dominican, African American, and West Indian populations. The neighborhood currently has rapidly growing Hispanic and black populations, and a declining white population. It is also divided by Kensington Avenue, with the area southeast of Kensington going towards Aramingo Avenue being predominantly white, with growing Hispanic and Black populations, and the area northwest of Kensington going towards Front Street being almost entirely populated by Hispanics and to a lesser extent Blacks.

The Knightley family originated at the Staffordshire manor of Knightley, acquired by them shortly after the Norman Conquest of 1066.Mark Noble In 1415 Sir Richard Knightley purchased the manor of Fawsley in Northamptonshire, where the senior line of the family became seated. Sir Edmund Knightley (c.1491-1542) of Fawsley was the third son, and eventual heir, of Sir Richard Knightley (d.1534) of Fawsley, who held 41 manors in the central midlands, by his wife Joan Skennard, daughter and heiress of Henry Skennard (or Skynnerton) of Alderton, Northamtonshire.

He married Ursula de Vere, a sister and coheiress of John de Vere, 14th Earl of Oxford (d.1526). He acquired much land following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, including in 1538 Studley Priory in Warwickshire.Thorpe, S.M., biography of Knightley, Richard (by 1484-1538), of Upton and Fawsley, Northants., published in History of Parliament: House of Commons 1509-1558, ed.

It was discovered underneath a colony of gray bats in 1967 by researchers Robert A. Kuehne and John E. Cooper and scientifically described in 1974.Cooper, J.E., and R.A. Kuehne (1974). \\"Speoplatyrhinus poulsoni, a New Genus and Species of Subterranean Fish from Alabama.\\" Copeia 1974: 486-93. doi: 10.2307/1442539 On any single visit to the cave, no more than 10 individuals of this fish have been observed, and scientists estimate fewer than 100 are left. This species of fish is believed to be the rarest species of cavefish in the United States and one of the rarest of all freshwater fish, as researchers have failed to find the fish in any other location. The Alabama cavefish exists in a fragile ecosystem based on nutrient-rich guano of the gray bat. Little is known of the reproductive habits and life history of the Alabama cavefish. However, researchers agree that the flooding of the cave triggers a hormonal change in the cavefish, prompting the fish to begin the reproductive cycle. Thus, variations in the frequency of the cave flooding negatively affect the survival of the species. Unfortunately, the Alabama cavefish is in danger of extinction, according to both the ESA and IUCN listings. Conservation measures that have been taken to save the species from extinction include protecting the fish under the Lacey Act and limiting human disturbance of Key Cave, the species' critical habitat. Habitat and Distribution The Alabama cavefish is one of the rarest cavefish species in North America. While the specific habitat requirements of the fish are unknown, it is known that the Alabama cavefish is a cave obligate, restricted to Key Cave in Lauderdale County, Alabama. Key Cave is the critical habitat of the Alabama cavefish. Cave habitats tend to be stable, with drastic changes mainly being associated with the inflow of water. Annual rainfall and flooding in the cave produce changes in water level, temperature, and food availability for the fish. Researchers speculate that the flooding may trigger a hormonal change in the cavefish for growth and reproduction. Since the discovery of the cavefish, only nine specimens have been collected (all before 1983). Because very few individuals have been collected and observed, and the population is confined to Key Cave, the Alabama cavefish is believed to be the rarest of the American cavefish and the rarest of all freshwater fish. Since the underground water system in the area is so widespread, researchers had hoped that the cavefish had dispersed to other sites. However, studies of the 120 other caves in the area, conducted since 1977, have failed to locate any other Alabama cavefish populations. No more than 10 individuals have been observed on any single visit to the Key Cave, and in the 36 visits from 1967 to 1998, the average was less than 4 per visit. The total number of individuals in the Key Cave population is estimated to be less than 100. Initially classified as vulnerable by the IUCN, its status has been gradually upgraded as its extreme rarity became apparent. The Alabama cavefish is currently considered critically endangered by the IUCN. Two reports of these fish in a nearby cave, Collier Cave, are still unconfirmed. Both Key Cave and Collier Cave are protected and inaccessible to the public. Because its known range is limited to a single cave, the Alabama cavefish has an uncertain future, being threatened by changes in groundwater quality and level, changes in aquifer characteristics, and diminished organic input, as well as competition and predation. It also may compete for resources with the syntopic southern cavefish (Typhlichthys subterraneus), which is more abundant and aggressive. Furthermore, cave crayfish feed on Alabama cavefish. Physiology The Alabama cavefish is roughly in length and has no eyes or discernible pigmentation, appearing semitransparent with a slight pink hue. Its large head makes up more than one-third of its length. The Alabama cavefish is the only species in its genus and can be distinguished from other cavefish by its elongated, flattened head with a laterally constricted snout and a terminal mouth. The Alabama cavefish lacks pelvic fins, and its fin rays are unbranched with the fin membranes deeply incised between the rays. It has an elaborate system of sensory papillae arranged in ridges on the head and sides, an adaptation to the dark environment of the cave. The Alabama cavefish has the most highly developed caudal sensory papillae in the family Amblyopsidae. Diet The diet of the Alabama cavefish, which consists of copepods, isopods, amphipods, and smaller cavefish, is supported by the nutrient-filled bat guano. It also can survive on other small organisms such as mites, spiders, millipedes, beetles, and other insects. Life History and Reproduction There is little information available on both the life history and reproductive cycle of the Alabama cavefish. It is hypothesized that, because of the jugular position of the vent and the size of the branchial chamber, the Alabama cavefish practices branchial incubation, or mouth- brooding. The Alabama cavefish, like most fish, utilizes seasonal cues to trigger hormonal changes that lead to its growth and reproduction. While most fish rely on a large change in water temperature or photoperiod, the Alabama cavefish mainly relies on the flooding of the cave in the winter and spring. This flooding results in an increased inflow of water into the cave and a small temperature change, signaling to the cavefish to begin reproduction. Even with these cues, reproduction does not occur every year for the Alabama cavefish. In years when reproduction does occur, only a few eggs are produced per female. Assumptions about the life history of the Alabama cavefish are largely based on information from the Northern cavefish, which sees only about 20% of the females spawn in a given year. It is hypothesized that the population growth for the Alabama cavefish is less than half of that of the Northern cavefish. Furthermore, the maximum longevity of the Alabama cavefish is estimated to be around 5‚Äì10 years; however, this estimate could be off by a factor of 3 or 4.  Listing History = Endangered Species Act  The Alabama cavefish was first listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act in 1977. Following further assessment of the species‚Äô range and changing environmental conditions, the cavefish was considered an endangered species in 1988. By 1990, a recovery plan was created for the fish, which stipulates that the species would be down-listed when the following three criteria are met: (1) three other viable populations are found in discontinuous aquatic systems outside the Key Cave area, (2) the aquifer recharge areas for all four populations are protected, and (3) all four populations are demonstrated to be stable or increasing over at least a 20-year period. In 2019, amendments to the recovery plan were made that changed the criteria for down-listing and created a criterion for delisting. For the cavefish to be down-listed, the criteria now stipulate that: (1) the species must demonstrate a stable or increasing trend in the existing Key Cave population, (2) two more cavefish populations must be created, and (3) the aquifer recharge areas must be delineated, mapped, and protected. In order for the cavefish to be delisted entirely, however, the aquifer recharge area must be protected by a conservation mechanism for at least one of the new populations and all other threats to the cavefish must be addressed or managed, allowing viability for the foreseeable future.  International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List  The Alabama cavefish was first listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in 1986 as vulnerable and remained in that category following re-evaluation in 1988. Two years later, in 1990, the status of the cavefish was reassessed and upgraded to endangered, which was then again confirmed by a reassessment in 1994. In 1996, the Alabama cavefish was again upgraded to critically endangered due to its lack of extent (100 sq. km), low population size, and numerous habitat challenges. The species was last assessed in April 2012, and although its population trend is stable, it is still listed as critically endangered.  Conservation  There are a few current conservation measures put in place to protect the Alabama cavefish. Along with being listed under the ESA, the species is protected by the Lacey Act. This makes it unlawful to import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase (alive or dead, including parts, products, eggs, or offspring) the Alabama cavefish. Secondly, The Tennessee Valley Authority, which owns the two entrances to the caves, has installed a fence to limit human disturbance. Lastly, in 1997, the Key Cave National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) was established. The Key Cave NWR aims at ensuring the biological integrity of the cave by protecting the sinkholes that carry surface water directly into the aquifer of the cave.  Human Impact  The largest human- induced threat to the survival of the Alabama cavefish is groundwater contamination within the recharge area of Key Cave. The recharge area is the place where water seeps into the ground and refills the aquifer. A major source of contamination is the chemicals used to cultivate crops grown in the areas surrounding the cave. Furthermore, the collection of the species by amateurs or for scientific purposes poses a major threat due to the already small population size.  Factors Likely to Cause Extinction  Many factors that are likely to cause the extinction of the Alabama cavefish are associated with the recharge zone of the Key Cave. The degradation of the groundwater due to agrochemicals and the decreasing level of groundwater limit the entry and cycling of uncontaminated water into Key Cave. The alteration of flood cycles within the aquifer often leads to unsuccessful cavefish reproduction. Furthermore, the Gray bat, Myotis grisescens, which is also protected under the ESA, provides nutrients to the Alabama cavefish through its guano. Therefore, the threats facing this bat species also impact the Alabama cavefish and its fuel source. All of these factors, combined with the already small population size and limited home range, pose severe threats to the Alabama cavefish.

It lies on the east side of the Rhine, north of Katz Castle (Cat Castle) in Sankt Goarshausen and opposite Rheinfels Castle at Sankt Goar across the river. History Construction of the castle was begun in 1356 by Archbishop-Elector of Trier Bohemond II and was continued for the next 30 years by successive Electors of Trier. The construction of Burg Maus was to enforce Trier's recently acquired Rhine River toll rights and to secure Trier's borders against the Counts of Katzenelnbogen (who had built Burg Katz and Burg Rheinfels). In the latter half of the 14th century Burg Maus was one of the residences of the Elector of Trier. Unlike its two neighbouring castles, Burg Maus was never destroyed, though it fell into disrepair in the 16th and 17th centuries. Restoration of the castle was undertaken between 1900 and 1906 under the architect Wilhelm G√§rtner with attention to historical detail. The castle suffered further damage from shelling during World War II which has since been repaired. Today Burg Maus hosts an aviary that is home to falcons, owls and eagles, and flight demonstrations are staged for visitors from late March to early October. Architecture The ward of the castle contains two residential buildings. The vulnerable side facing uphill is guarded by a round bergfried. Names Local folklore attributes the name to the Counts of Katzenelnbogen's mocking of the Electors of Trier during the 30 years of construction, who reportedly said that the castle was the \\"mouse\\" that would be eaten by the \\"cat\\" of Burg Katz. The originally intended name was Burg Peterseck (or St. Peterseck). A matched castle on the left bank (to control the bank north of Burg Rheinfels) that was to be named Burg Peterberg was never constructed. Other names by which Burg Maus is known are Thurnberg (or Thurmberg) and Deuernburg. Gallery Image:Burg Maus am Rhein.JPGBurg Maus above the Rhine.

He remained with the show for nearly five years afterwards, making his last appearance on 10 October 1989. Ali was scripted as happy-go-lucky, which was in stark contrast to his highly strung wife, Sue (Sandy Ratcliff). Central to his storylines were his penchant for gambling, his tempestuous marriage, and the loss of his son to cot death, which was one of the first controversial storylines covered by the soap. He was created by Julia Smith and Tony Holland, the creators of EastEnders.  Storylines  Ali, a Turkish Cypriot, runs Bridge Street Caf√© in Walford with his wife, Sue Osman (Sandy Ratcliff), and also drives a taxicab. He is a gambler and frequently holds poker games in the caf√© after closing time and wages bets at the bookies, which is a huge source of concern for Sue. Ali rashly decides to wager his business on a bet in 1985 and wins a substantial amount of money. The Osmans are overjoyed but the next day their infant son, Hassan Osman (Michael Evangelou), is found dead in his cot. Ali and Sue spend months coming to terms with their son's death. The marriage is tested further when they try for another baby but Ali suffers impotence and questions his masculinity, resulting in him attempting to seduce other women; the desperation for a baby causes problems until Sue learns that she is pregnant again in 1987. Their second son, Little Ali Osman (Omer Mustafa Salih), is born in 1988. When Sue begins to tire of life in Walford, Ali tries to get funds together to facilitate their move. In doing so, he runs up huge gambling debts to Joanne Francis (Pamela Salem), manager of Strokes wine bar, also a member of the criminal underworld known as The Firm. Desperate for money to hide his losses from Sue, Ali asks Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) for a loan. Ian agrees and charges him 10 percent interest. Ali continues to gamble, struggling to pay Ian until he manages to win. Pleased with himself, Ali's boasting catches the attention of Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler); she seduces Ali and after they have sex, Donna blackmails Ali, threatening to tell Sue unless he pays her. Ali pays but Donna tells Sue regardless when Sue insults her. Devastated, Sue turns to Ali's brother, Mehmet Osman (Haluk Bilginer), for comfort and wanting revenge, she kisses him in front of Ali. Thinking that his brother has been sleeping with his wife, Ali attacks Mehmet and banishes him from his life and after much rowing, Sue and Little Ali leave. Ali searches for Sue and eventually finds her visiting Hassan's grave and snatches Little Ali back. Losing another son makes Sue have a breakdown and she is sectioned. Now a single father, Ali struggles to keep his businesses afloat. He cannot afford the rent increase and attempts an insurance scam by torching his cafe. Ian works out that Ali started the fire deliberately and uses the situation to his advantage, forcing Ali to sign the cafe over to him. This causes a feud between them when Ali neglects to mention that the kitchen utilities were bought on hire purchase and are later repossessed. Ali struggles with juggling work and parental responsibilities. He has to resign from Frank Butcher's (Mike Reid) car lot when he discovers his child-minder is neglecting his son. He takes up mini-cabbing but when his car is stolen, he can't work so he is forced to send Little Ali to live with his parents. With no money, Ali attends a game of poker but loses to his landlord Alan McIntyre (Pip Miller), whom Ali had feuded with since 1987. As a result, Ali is evicted when he can't pay the rent. In a fury, Ali smashes up the flat with a crowbar, breaking all the windows and doors, until his family send him and Little Ali to Northern Cyprus in October 1989.  Creation  Ali Osman was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Ali, a Turkish Cypriot, was originally intended to be named Chris. His name was changed to Ali when it dawned on Holland that he had given a Christian name to a Muslim. Ali was a well-intentioned attempt to represent the proportion of Turkish Cypriots who had immigrated to England and settled in the East End of London. Holland and Smith knew that for the soap to succeed there needed to be a varied group of characters, so that several different sections of the audience had someone to identify with. Additionally, if the programme was to be realistic, it had to reflect the cross-section of society that actually existed in the real location. For these reasons, different sexes, ages, classes, religions and races were all included in the original character line-up. Both Holland and Smith had been at the forefront of the move towards 'integrated casting' in television and had encountered an array of ethnic diversities in the process. Even though the ethnic minority groups were deemed the hardest to research, Holland and Smith called upon their contacts to relay information about their origins and lifestyles and were then able to portray Walford's most recent immigrants more realistically. Ali's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, EastEnders: The Inside Story. In this passage Ali is referred to as \\"Chris\\". :\\"Chris is a Turkish Cypriot, his wife Sue is English, and they run the cafe just off the Square. In the evenings, Chris is also a minicab driver. They have a nine-month-old son named after Chris' dad - Hassan - and they are devoted to him....Chris was born in Cyprus in 1957. But, as it turned out in 1974, he was a Turk in a Greek zone. A refugee-camp followed. Then, the family was resettled in a Turkish zone. But, it never felt like home, and there was no money so, in 1975 they came to London...Chris married Sue in 1982...Chris is basically lazy, and a gambler. Not (yet) a compulsive gambler - but he is a passionate one...He's a bit of a peacock. He expects to be waited on hand and foot...Chris is always having to prove himself.\\" (page 59) The casting of Ali was a huge problem for Holland and Smith. During that time in the 80s only three Turkish-speaking actors could be located in London, and one of those was considered unsuitable. The other two, Haluk Bilginer and Nejdet Salih, were possibilities. Deciding which to cast caused major rows between Holland and Smith. Holland favoured Bilginer as he looked the part. He felt Salih did not have the physical presence needed and also believed that Sandy Ratcliff (the actress playing his on-screen wife) would \\"make mincemeat out of him\\". Smith disagreed. As Salih was actually an East Londoner whose parents were Turkish Cypriots (whilst Bilginer was Turkish) she felt he would have actual knowledge to bring to the character and wouldn't have to act the part as \\"he was the part\\". He also lived in the East End, as did his large family. To resolve the conflict both actors were given readings with Sandy Ratcliff and Salih eventually won the role following a cheeky, sexist remark aimed at Ratcliff and her tardy time-keeping. Both Holland and Smith felt this typified the character perfectly. Ironically, both actors eventually featured in the series, as Bilinger was brought back to take on the role of Ali's older brother. Peter Batt, one of EastEnders' original scriptwriters, has alleged that he created the character of Ali, and that he was based on himself: \\"a lunatic fucking gambler\\". Development Before the show aired, Holland and Smith had already decided that Sue and her husband would be parents to a young baby named Hassan. However, as further characters were invented they realised that there would be a total of four babies in the show: Annie Smith, Martin Fowler, Vicki Fowler and Hassan. It was decided that it would be impossible for the studios to cope with four babies, and so they invented a storyline to eliminate one of the young babies from the cast. During this time in the 1980s, the issue of cot death was extremely prominent in the British press, partly due to an increase in casualties, but also because a doctor had gone public with the accusation that parents were to blame for the tragic occurrence. Holland and Smith decided that covering this subject in the soap would be a good way of 'setting the record straight', and so it was decided that Sue and Ali's baby would die from cot death in the early months of the show. This was the first of many controversial storylines in EastEnders' history. After the storyline aired in June 1985, the show was praised by audience and press alike for the sensitive and unsensational way this harrowing subject was treated. The sudden tragedy came as a surprise to the audience, especially since the bereaved parents were a couple whose feuding, fighting ways had made them appear rather comic in the early episodes of the show. The British Cot Death Foundation initially feared that a soap opera would trivialise the subject and frighten new parents. They tried to stop the episodes from airing, but in the end they were pleased with the way the subject was handled, and provided back-up support after transmission to many viewers who wanted more information on the subject. The character of Ali lasted in the show for over four years, remaining after the mental breakdown of his highly strung wife and depicting the plight of a single-parent father. Ali was eventually written out of the serial in 1989 following the departure of Smith and Holland from the series and the introduction of a new producer, Mike Gibbon. Reception It has been suggested by Comedy Central that \\"the tempestuous relationship between Sue and Ali Osman kept many an EastEnders viewer on the edge of their seat.\\" The couple were described by the website as a diet coke version of the popular EastEnders couple, Den and Angie \\"running the caf√© rather than the Queen Vic\\". In 2011, an EastEnders' storyline aired featuring the character Ronnie Branning's (Samantha Womack) baby dying of a cot death and the mother subsequently swapping her dead baby with another character's child. This plot has been compared unfavourably to the Osman cot death of 1985.

It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home stadium of Panionios G.S.S. which plays for the Greek Super League. The stadium is located in the southern suburb of Nea Smyrni (Greek: ŒùŒ≠Œ± Œ£ŒºœçœÅŒΩŒ∑), which is the heart of the team's fanbase. The all seated stadium holds 11,700 spectators and was built in 1939. Before full seating was installed on 1998 for the participation of Panionios FC in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup its capacity was close to 19,000. The stadium is eligible to host UEFA Europa League matches and its football pitch dimensions are about average at 105x72m. Early history Panionios FC playing a home game in Nea Smyrni Stadium In November 1937, Panionios G.S.S. Board of Directors led by President D. Karabatis and the Municipality of Nea Smyrni agreed to relocate the club in Nea Smyrni, the Athens suburb that was mainly inhabited by Greek World War I refugees coming from Smyrna, the club's historical home. Construction works started in 1938, and were completed one year later. In the summer of 1940 the first football matches take place, with the club donating the money to support the repair of Greek Warship \\"Elli\\" which was hit by Italian forces on World War II. On September later that year Panionios G.S.S. celebrated its 50th year together with the completion of building the new stadium. Since then it has been used constantly for over 70 years from Panionios G.S.S. associated clubs and sports divisions. Recent history Improvement works have been undertaken in 2001 and 2003 including a cafeteria, Panionios G.S.S. sports shop, press and office facilities, improved medical and player facilities etc. Additionally a roof was placed above the East wing of the stadium. In 2009 Panionios G.S.S. installed an electronic ticketing system on the stadium to improve security in the team's matches. Despite the improvements the core fan base of the team as well as its management strongly support that the old stadium is inadequate to cover the team's needs in terms of quality of services provided to the fans. Additionally, there are safety concerns as the stadium does not have enough entry and exit points in case of emergency. View from the stadium's East Wing The highest attendance ever recorded was on 1974 against Panathinaikos with 20,950 spectators. After the installation of seats and the reduction of the stadium's capacity there have been numerous matches with full attendance mainly in European competitions. The most recent ticket 'sold-out' was against Panathinaikos in 2008. Apart from Panionios G.S.S. and its associated youth teams, the stadium was used for decades from Panionios G.S.S. athletes on track & field and numerous times from the Greek National U-21 and U-23 football teams. Additionally, due to the closing of many stadiums for renovation for the 2004 Athens Olympic Games, Nea Smyrni stadium was partly used from other football clubs as well. Those included AEK FC for the first half of the 2003/2004 football season and Olympiacos F.C. for one match on February 2003 against OFI. Last it has been the venue site for the 2004 Greek Cup final played by Panathinaikos and Olympiacos. Due to its densely populated location, Nea Smyrni stadium has rarely been used as a concert site. The most famous concert ever taken place was Metallica's first appearance in Greece on June 27, 1993. New stadium Panionios G.S.S. President Constantinos Tsakiris has announced the willingness of the club to replace the old stadium with a brand new 29.000 m¬≤ athletic centre cost of which will be approximately 60 million euro. The new athletic centre will include a modern football stadium of 12,000 seats, a basketball and a volleyball arena, an aquatic complex (including a water polo pool of 33m., 1 swimming pool of 25m., pools for children learning), a track and field training center as well as facilities for boxing, rhythmic gymnastics, wrestling, etc. Additionally, it will include a building complex of 6.500 m¬≤ for complementary amenities of the football stadium like vestry, administration offices, restaurants, VIP accommodations, and press facilities. The extra facilities other than the football stadium will be used by Panionios G.S.S., the multi-sport club under which Panionios G.S.S. belongs. The new stadium project has triggered a minor controversy as small number of petitioners alongside side with members of the council of the Municipality of Nea Smyrni are objecting in its construction and are threatening to take legal action unless a new formula will be agreed between all parties regarding certain aspects of the project. The main argument of the opposition group is that the new athletic center will have increased commercial spaces (measured in square meters) in comparison to the existing one, thus increasing traffic and congestion in the area. The club responds that this extra space for commercial use in the project's architectural plans mainly consist of parking spaces and administration offices for Panionios G.S.S. and Panionios G.S.S. which is a common land use for the area and not department stores as the opposition believes. Additionally, the club legally argues that according to the current urban planning status of the existing stadium there is space for extra commercial uses that are not in operation/lease (have been in the past but failed to stay open). The debate has temporarily paused, with the club pointing that without the commercial spaces in place the new project cannot generate enough income to repay its construction cost and has promised to come back with an alternative proposal that will satisfy all parties. Moreover, the Municipality of Nea Smyrni which has collectively taken a positive stance towards the new athletic center is expected to facilitate the debate and assist its resolution.

The high dome that rises above the city is the centrepiece of the skyline and presides over the Old Market Square (also referred to as the City Centre). It is a Grade II* listed building. History The Council House was commissioned to replace the former Nottingham Exchange. It was designed by Thomas Cecil Howitt in the Neo-Baroque style and built between 1927 and 1929.Pevsner, N. (2nd Edition,1978) The Buildings of England: Nottinghamshire (Penguin Books) Housed within the dome the affectionately-nicknamed ‚ÄòLittle John‚Äô hour bell ‚Äì the deepest toned clock bell in the United Kingdom, weighing over ‚Äì whose strike can be heard for a distance of seven miles. Scene in the Old Market Square for the official opening of the Council House, 22 May 1929The foundation stone (behind the left-hand lion as you approach the building) was laid by Alderman Herbert Bowles (Chairman of the Estates Committee), on 17 March 1927. The total cost of the building at the time was ¬£502,876 (). By the time the bill was finally cleared in 1981, the total including interest was ¬£620,294 (). The building was officially opened by the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII and subsequently the Duke of Windsor) on 22 May 1929. The building has staged many high-profile occasions with royalty, statesmen and women, and stars of the stage and screen. Both the FA Cup in 1959, and the European Cup in 1979 and 1980, have been held aloft from its balcony. Since Nottingham City Council relocated councillors‚Äô offices to Loxley House in 2010, the Council House is seldom used for day-to-day administrative functions. From April 2011, the building also now serves as the chief Register Office for Births, Marriages and Deaths in the City. Exterior The Council House and Exchange Buildings (to the rear) are constructed of Portland Stone from the same quarry used by Sir Christopher Wren for St. Paul's Cathedral in London. The terrace overlooking the Old Market Square has eight massive columns, above are 21 figures representing the activities of the Council, also modelled by Joseph Else FRBS, the Principal of the Nottingham School of Art from 1923 to 1939.

The golden ball on the very top of the dome stands above the Old Market Square below. Apart from Little John, the famous bell and its clock mechanism which was manufactured and installed by William W. Cope of the famous Cope clockmaking family. The hour bell has been named 'Little John' since the building opened. The bell was cast in 1928, by the world-famous bellfounders John Taylor & Co. of Loughborough. At in weight, 'Little John' is the 4th heaviest founded by John Taylor & Co. and the 6th heaviest in the British Isles. The E tone is the deepest, for a non-swinging clock bell in the British Isles. The Exchange (Exchange Arcade) The ground floor is predominantly an upmarket fashion- dominated shopping mall ‚Äì now called ‚ÄòThe Exchange‚Äô in honour of the Nottingham Exchange ‚Äì having had an image makeover in 2005. The original name of Exchange Arcade is still used by many local people however. Retailing space was included in the design to fund the Corporation‚Äôs construction of the building, during the Great Depression and remained under council control until sold in 1985 and redeveloped as a shopping centre. This part of the building has been in private hands since that time, and is currently owned by a Pension Fund. Each shop has its own basement showroom or storage facilities, deliveries being made via an underground roadway, served by a vehicular lift on Cheapside. This service area was originally the fresh produce hall, and received natural light via pavement lights in the floor of the arcade above. The locations of those lights can still be seen, marked by the 1985-vintage terracotta tile strips which replaced them, interspersed between the York stone paving slabs. The paved areas were replaced in 2014 with identical York stone. Painted murals underneath the Council House dome feature: *The Danes capturing Nottingham in 868: *William the Conqueror ordering the building of the castle in 1068; *Robin Hood and his Merry Men; *King Charles I raising his standard at the start of the Civil War in 1642. Each mural was the work of local artist Noel Denholm Davis. The artist used local celebrities as models. Thus T. Cecil Howitt himself appears in the guise of William the Conqueror‚Äôs surveyor, and Notts County F.C. goalkeeper Albert Iremonger as Little John. The inscription around the base of the dome reads: ‚ÄúThe Corporation of Nottingham erected this building for counsel and welcome, and to show merchandise and crafts‚Äù. The condition of these murals has deteriorated in recent years, largely through the ingress of water. The Robin Hood mural was particularly severely damaged in this way. In June 2018 Nottingham City Council finished a complete restoration of the damaged murals in a process which took about three months. Statuary Detail of sculpture on principal facade, showing a model of the Council House Detail of sculpture on principal facade, showing statue of Justice Much of the external statuary is by Joseph Else (1875‚Äì1955), Principal of the Nottingham School of Art (now part of Nottingham Trent University). Else was responsible for the famous lions guarding the entrance, for the frieze above the Ballroom windows (representing ancient local industries such as bellfounding and alabaster) and for the figures in the principal fa√ßade‚Äôs pediment (depicting the arts and public service). A pub overlooking the Square is now named after Else. The Lions Left lion Right lion Created by Joseph Else, the two art-deco lions each weigh and stand guard on either side of the entrance steps. They are similar in design to the lions used to publicise the British Empire Exhibition of 1924/25. Joseph Else named them, ‚ÄòAgamemnon‚Äô and ‚ÄòMenelaus‚Äô, after the elder son and younger son of King Atreus of Mycenae, from Greek mythology. Alternative colloquial names are, ‚ÄòLeo‚Äô (Left) and ‚ÄòOscar‚Äô (Right). The colloquialism, ‚ÄòMeet you by the lions‚Äô (often the left lion), became part of the local dialect from the beginning of their existence, and is in fact, frequently demonstrated by the sight of people meeting and greeting nearby on a regular basis. Sculpture Groups around the Dome These groups were created by Joseph Else and three former students of the School of Art. All the sculptors were born and raised in Nottingham. *'Commerce' by Joseph Else. The 2 male figures are pushing a ship, carrying a female holding a caduceus. This is at the Exchange Walk (Natwest Bank) corner. *'Civic Law' by Charles L J Doman. A smiling central female figure holds a sceptre in her right hand and book in her left. At her feet are the figures of Law (holding a fasces and Justice (carrying a sword). This group is at the Long Row / King Street corner. *'Prosperity' by James Woodford. Strikingly Art-Deco, a female holds a sword. At her feet are a mother and baby, and a female holding the fruits of the earth. This group is at the Long Row East corner, (best seen from outside the Yorkshire Bank). Woodford is the most famous of the sculptors outside his native Nottingham, having created the heraldic Queen's Beasts for the 1953 Coronation Pavilion at Westminster Abbey. He also had commissions for the liner RMS Queen Mary, the RIBA building in London, as well as the famous statue of Robin Hood at Nottingham Castle. *'Knowledge' by Ernest Webb. A female figure (in striking 1920s hat) holds a globe. The 2 male figures sit at her feet, one holding a book, the other a pair of compasses.

Both the beginning and endpoints of the road are on Interstate 90. It is known as the Pintler Scenic Loop and provides access to the community of Philipsburg as well as the Georgetown Lake area and the Discovery Ski Area. MT 1 was one of the first roads to be paved in its entirety in Montana and has seen many changes over the years. This road was formerly designated as U.S. Highway 10 Alternate (US 10 ALT). It received its current number after US 10 was decommissioned through the area in 1986. History MT 1 was first designated on October 9, 1922, near its present location. By 1924, its route had been designated as part of the National Parks Highway Auto Trail. This route followed the general path of MT 1, traveling from Opportunity through Anaconda and Philipsburg to Drummond. The overall length of the routing was approximately , and was generally an unimproved dirt road. By the next year, the National Parks Highway had been rerouted away from this route. The unsigned MT 1 had been rerouted, now with an overall length of approximately . Also by 1925, the portion of MT 1 traveling from its southern terminus to Anaconda had been paved. Also, the section of the highway near the town of Brown traveling to Stone had been graded, while the rest of the route remained unimproved dirt. By at least 1927, MT 1 had been rerouted, with an overall length of approximately , and the portion of the highway traveling from Stone to its northern terminus had been graded. At least two years later, the entire length of the route had been graded. In 1934, the portion of MT 1 that traveled from modern-day milepost 24.190 to the Deer Lodge‚ÄìGranite County border was reconstructed along its current route. By 1937, MT 1 had been concurrently numbered as US 10, and later that year, US 10 was rerouted, and MT 1 was renumbered as US 10 ALT. Also by that time, the route had been rerouted so that the overall length was approximately , and the entire length of the route had at least a graded gravel surface. By 1948, the portion of the route that traveled from Philipsburg to Drummond had been paved. In 1951, the entire length of MT 1/US 10 ALT was paved, with an overall length of approximately . Also, the portion of MT 1/US 10 ALT traveling from present day mileposts 9.426 to 9.940 was reconstructed along its current route. In 1957, the sections of MT 1/US 10 ALT traveling from modern route mileposts 16.757 to 21.934 and 30.703 to 38.405 were reconstructed along the present route. In 1960, the portions of the highway traveling from current mileposts 21.935 to 24.189 and 38.406 to 48.106 were reconstructed along the present road. The next year, the portion of MT 1/US 10 ALT traveling from the junction with S-441 to the junction with Elm Street (U-203) were rebuilt along the highway's present location. In 1964, the portion of the road traveling from the southern terminus to the junction with S-441 were reconstructed to the present day routing. Two years later, the portion traveling from modern milepost 62.323 to the northern terminus were reconstructed. In 1975, the portion traveling from Elm Street to Sycamore Street (U-201) was reconstructed to the modern route. In 1976, the route had an approximate length of . In 1986, U.S. Route 10 was replaced in Montana by Interstate 90. This caused the removal of the concurrent U.S. Route 10 Alternate numbering from MT 1. In 2000, the portion of MT 1 traveling from modern mileposts 48.107 to 62.322 was reconstructed to the current routing. In 2008, the small portion traveling from mileposts 10.058 to 16.756 was reconstructed. The route has not been changed since.

The stadium seats 8,150 people on individual seats. In 2012 a statue of former Dukla player and European Footballer of the Year 1962 Josef Masopust was unveiled outside the stadium.  History  The stadium played host to its first Dukla match on 10 July 1960 in the 1960 Mitropa Cup.

The area is named for settler Jeremiah Morgan (earliest published Munro 1882 and USGS 1898). Here is the Morgan Territory Entrance Jeremiah Morgan Historic monument honoring Jermiah Morgan at its Morgan Red Corral property on Morgan Territory Road, with text prepared by Morgan Territory historian Anne Homan. The \\"Territory\\" and \\"Road\\" were named for Jeremiah \\"Jerry\\" Morgan (1819-1906) and his descendants. Morgan hunted in the area in 1856 then moved there in 1857 \\"because the grizzly bear hunting was so good\\". Morgan had seventeen children. A one room school house and school district provided the first official name for the region (Munro-1882) which was later cemented by Morgan Territory Road. Morgan, however, called it the \\"Morning Side of the Mountain.\\" Jeremiah was born in the Cherokee Nation, Alabama, near the Tennessee River. He came to California in 1849, and claimed 10,000 acres (40 km¬≤) of unsurveyed land on \\"the morning side of Mount Diablo\\" in 1856. After the official first survey by the U.S. government in 1862, Jeremiah's land claims were reduced to 2,000 acres (8 km¬≤). Jeremiah had 17 children by his first wife, Sarah Ellis Morgan, who died in 1869 and his second, Louisa Riggs. \\"Morgan Territory Road\\" was officially designated by Contra Costa County in 1892. The road is long and passes through four townships. In 2004 Save Mount Diablo memorialized Jeremiah Morgan with a historic monument at its Morgan Red Corral property on Morgan Territory Road, with text prepared by Morgan Territory historian Anne Homan. Morgan Territory Road The Morgan Territory Road stretches from Manning Road north of Livermore to Marsh Creek Road east of Clayton, at times a single lane wide‚Äîfor ten miles (16 km) there is no center line‚Äîand with no intersecting through roads. It began as a muddy wagon track linking ranches in the Black Hills and east of Mount Diablo. The northern slope of the road largely follows Marsh Creek. The northern part of the road was officially accepted by Contra Costa County in 1886 and designated \\"Morgan Road\\" in 1892. After realignment the southern section was accepted by the County as a public highway in 1895. A short southern section in Alameda County was designated \\"Beck Road\\" in 1907 for John Beck, a nearby landowner, and for some years the through road south was known as Finley Road. The southern section rises from the 600‚Äô contour to 2,063‚Äô at the summit. A quarter mile section with a 14% grade is known as \\"the Levy\\" for early landowner Samuel Levy, who owned the adjoining property. A \\"summer road\\" until 1937, the southern road section was graveled from Manning to the Levy; locals called it the \\"Black Hills Road.\\" The northern section from the last creek bridge north was graveled in the 1930s. The road was paved in the 1950s. Bowerman (1944) shows the road as the \\"Livermore Road\\", according to historian Annie Homan. Morgan Territory Regional Preserve Morgan Territory Regional Preserve, called \\"Top of the World Park\\" by area historian and resident Anne Homan, and the surrounding region are named for pioneer settler Jeremiah Morgan. Established in 1976, the East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD) preserve's nearly 5,000 acres (20 km¬≤) are an important wildlife and recreational corridor stretching east from Riggs Canyon and Mount Diablo State Park to the Contra Costa Water District's Los Vaqueros watershed and EBRPD's Round Valley Preserve. The original preserve was located on Morgan Territory Ridge, east of Morgan Territory Road, and including the headwaters of Marsh Creek, but was expanded in the late 1980s and afterwards across the parallel Highland Ridge west of the road and into Riggs Canyon. Morgan Territory's sandstone hills include the headwaters of Marsh and Tassajara creeks, feature more than ninety species of wildflowers, and are home to mountain lion, golden eagles and the endemic Diablo sunflower and Diablo manzanita. Expansive views stretch to Mt. Diablo and Mount St. Helena to the north and the Sierra Nevada range to the east. Preserve trails are named for the First people, such as the Volvon (one of five Native American nations in the Diablo area who spoke dialects of the Bay Miwok language); animals such as condor (), prairie falcon, eagle and coyote; and for natural features of the preserve's ranching history (Valley View, Blue Oak, and Highland Ridge). Manfred Lindner & Hulet Hornbeck In the late 1960s and early 1970s Manfred \\"Manny\\" Lindner of the Contra Costa Park Council helped lead efforts to establish a new preserve in Morgan Territory, going so far as to create a large three dimensional model of the main ridge and the headwaters of Marsh Creek that were most prized. Hulet Hornbeck, Chief of Acquisitions for the EBRPD, collaborated with Lindner in convincing the District Board of Directors to create the Preserve in an area with little public interest or need. These efforts would prove to be prescient as the population of the nearby Tri-Valley exploded and the boom of Silicon Valley would dramatically increase land prices. Bob Walker & Bob Doyle Bob Walker (1952-1992), environmentalist and photographer, a president of the Sierra Club San Francisco Bay Chapter and one of the founders of the Chapter's Gay Lesbian Activities Section (GLS), the first such group, led the dramatic expansion of the preserve in the late 1980s and early 1990s from 970 acres (3.9 km¬≤) to more than 5,000 acres (20 km¬≤). Walker was also a member of the Board of Directors of the non-profit Save Mount Diablo. The same period was marked by expansion of Mount Diablo State Park east to join with the Preserve in Riggs Canyon. Serving with Walker was Robert Doyle, president of Save Mount Diablo at the time and who had succeeded Hornbeck as Assistant General Manager and Chief of Acquisitions for the EBRPD. Doyle and Walker strategized about how to create public support for expanding the Preserve from its original 970 acres (3.9 km¬≤), and in 1987 the square mile Marshall property was added to the Preserve. Seth Adams, staff for Save Mount Diablo, aided Walker and Doyle even as SMD worked to expand the nearby Mt. Diablo State Park with its Morgan Ranch acquisition. This first connection between the two parks, marked by SMD's acquisition of the 631 acre (2.6 km¬≤) Morgan Ranch, was celebrated by a 1988 backpacking trip that eventually led to the 1994 creation of the Diablo Trail across six parks from Walnut Creek to Brentwood. In quick succession large square mile sections were added to the Preserve even as the 19,000 acre (77 km¬≤) Los Vaqueros watershed was preserved to the east and Round Valley, threatened by Contra Costa County landfill proposals, was made into another new adjoining Regional Preserve. Bob Walker died of AIDS in 1992 but lived long enough for the Board of Directors of the EBRPD to memorialize him with the naming of the Bob Walker Ridge (a section of Morgan Territory Ridge) and of the Bob Walker Regional Trail (overlaying sections of the Highland Ridge and Diablo Trails.) Walker's collection of more than 30,000 photographic slides, primarily of the East Bay, were transferred to the Natural History Section of the Oakland Museum, also known as the Museum of California. Morgan Ranch The 631 acre (2.6 km¬≤) Morgan Ranch was acquired from Willard \\"Bill\\" & Naomi Morgan in 1989 by Save Mount Diablo and transferred to Mt. Diablo State Park to become the first and corner connection to Morgan Territory Regional Preserve. Bill Morgan is a great grandson of Jeremiah Morgan. The Morgan Ranch is a nearly square parcel which rises from Marsh Creek, is draped over Highland Ridge, and then descends west to Tassajara Creek in Riggs Canyon. Morgan Red Corral In 2004 Save Mount Diablo also acquired the \\"Morgan Red Corral\\" across Morgan Territory Road from the Morgan Ranch, in part to serve as a staging area for this easternmost part of the State Park. Also in 2004 Save Mount Diablo memorialized Jeremiah Morgan with a historic monument at its Morgan Red Corral property on Morgan Territory Road, text prepared by Morgan Territory historian Anne Homan. Morgan Backpack Camp The Morgan Backpack Camp (Morgan Territory Regional Preserve) was constructed in 2001 on the Highland Ridge Trail, a section of the Diablo Trail, at the former Cardoza homesite. The site was a campsite on the inaugural 1988 trip on the proposed Diablo Trail and was later improved into a camping facility. Morgan Sulfur Spring Morgan Sulfur Spring is in lower Curry Canyon, Morgan Territory, found part way down Sulfur Spring Canyon, which drains from Windy Point to Curry Creek. May have been named by Mary Bowerman, who designated it as \\"Morgan Sulphur Spring\\" probably for the Morgan family for whom the area is named. References Adams, Seth, A History of Mt. Diablo, Mt.

His mother was Welette Tekle Haymanot wife of dejazmach Gugsa Mercha. Ras Araya Selassie Yohannes was his older half brother. Prior to the Battle of Metemma, Mengesha Yohannes was considered to be a nephew of Emperor Yohannes IV. During the battle, the Emperor was mortally wounded and it was on his deathbed that Mengesha Yohannes was acknowledged as his \\"natural\\" son and designated as his heir. This created something of a succession problem.Marcus, A History of Ethiopia, pg.89 Fighting between various relatives of the slain Emperor split his camp and prevented Mengesha from making a viable bid for the Imperial throne. Instead, the throne was assumed by Negus Menelik of Shewa. Ras Mengesha refused to submit to Menelik and later even flirted with joining the new Italian colony of Eritrea. He hoped that the Italians would support his rebellion against Emperor Menelik. However, encroachments by the Italians into his native Tigray, their previous enmity to his father Yohannes, and recognition that the ultimate goal of the Italians was to conquer Ethiopia themselves, led Mengesha Yohannes to finally submit to Menelik II. On 2 June 1894, he and his three major lieutenants went to the new capital at Addis Ababa. Within the newly constructed reception hall of the Grand Palace, the Emperor awaited them. He was seated on his throne with a large crown on his head. Mengesha Yohannes and his lieutenants each carried a rock of submission on his shoulder. They approached, prostrated themselves, and asked for forgiveness. Menelik simply declared them pardoned.Marcus, A History of Ethiopia, pg.95https://www.academia.edu/20783536/A_Glimpse_of_History_Power_Treachery_Diplomacy_and_War_in_Ethiopia_1889-1906_RP_Vol._IX_No._XXVII_MMXVI Following their allegiance with Menelik, they returned to Tigray, where Bahta Hagos initiated the rebellion against the Italians. Mengesha then led his army against the Italians at the Battle of Coatit, where his force was rebuffed. Another skirmish led by Fitawrari Gebeyehu, the vanguard commander of Menelik forces on the way to Adwa, annihilated the Italians at Amba Alagi. The war culminated in 1896, as Mengesha Yohannes and the forces of Tigray fought at the side of Menelik against the Italians at the pivotal Battle of Adwa.http://www.aciesedizioni.it/Giochi/Link/AscariContextENG.pdf In 1899, Mengesha Yohannes rebelled again against Menelik when he was denied the title of Negus of Zion (his descendants would be outraged decades later when Ras Mikael of Wollo was crowned with this title by Lij Iyasu). Emperor Menelik had Ras Mengesha captured and put under house arrest at the old Shewan royal palace at Ankober.  Biography = Early Life  Before 1889, Mengesha Yohannes was considered the Emperor's nephew, but on 9 March 1889 the Emperor on his deathbed, in Metemma, recognized him as his son, from a side-relation with his brother Gugsa's wife. Therefore, some informants still claim that Mengesha Yohannes was strongly attached to Yohannes throughout his life. Dejazmach Mengesha Yohannes was designated by the Emperor as his heir-to-the- throne, and allegedly crowned still on the battlefield of Metemma, but Mengesha Yohannes was not able to claim the throne. In the aftermath of the disastrous battle of Metemma, the Tigrayan ruling families found themselves embroiled in a power struggle that led to a regional civil war. This state of anarchy sapped the energy of Mengesha Yohannes's camp to unite the region under his authority. Quickly, instead atse Menelik II was proclaimed emperor in November 1889. Ras Mengesha Yohannes, however, had the strong military and political backing of Yohannes's chief military general ras Alula Engada. Additionally, he had inherited a considerable number of armaments and soldiers that had long bolstered the power of Yohannes IV. However, historians cast doubts on Mengesha Yohanens's basic military prowess and leadership skills to mobilize the available resources and prevail over rivals, in contrast to his predecessor Yohannes. Mengesha Yohannes's strong political ambition once nearly pushed him to ally with the Italians, as demonstrated by the Mereb Convention of 1891. By 1890, the Italians had taken control of the Mereb Mellash, and aimed at the control of entire Tigray. In the meanwhile, Mengesha Yohannes and his Tigrayan vassals had revolted against atse Menelik II. Italian attempts to instigate them were, nonetheless, short-lived. The Italians' non-committed stance, coupled with Mengesha Yohannes's hesitant attitude finally convinced him to end his rebellion, even against the opposition of his counsellors and his military supporters, such as ras Alula.  Rule  In June 1894, Mengesha Yohannes ultimately dropped his claims to the imperial throne and officially submitted to atse Menelik II, ostensibly in expectation of the title of negus of Tigray. Menelik, in turn, appointed him governor, not negus of Tigray. For a while, Mengesha Yohannes demonstrated his loyalty. The conflict subsequently developing between the Italians and Menelik, gave him the opportunity to prove his indispensability to the central government. During the first phase, in the years 1894-95, the Italians made a number of incursions into northern Ethiopia. Mengersha Yohannes was then responsible for defending the northern borders. He was beaten in the two battles of Kweatit (1894), Senafe (Eritrea) and Debre Hayle (1895): in early 1896 he even retreated from his stronghold Mekelle, but kept the Italians busy until a united Ethiopian army was gathered to face them. Ras Mengesha Yohannes played an even more important role in the next phase of the conflict. Together with ras Alula, he was largely responsible for organizing and running the intelligence of Menelik II. He exploited his local connections, gathered intelligence and rendered a fairly outstanding command of the Tigrayan army. All these inputs had a crucial role in deciding the outcome of the battle of Adwa in 1896, which ended up as a grim loss to the Italians. Despite Mengesha Yohannes's retention of \\"Tigray proper\\", Eritrea remained in the hands of the Italians. His proposal to sustain the war to push the Italians out of Eritrea was played down by the Emperor, who focused on the control of his own realm. Menelik officially rewarded Mengesha Yohannes with 300,000 silver dollars and married him to Kafay Wele Batul of Yejju, atege Taytu's niece. The marriage was meant to cement further the bonds between the houses of Tigray, Shewa, and Yejju. It was obtained at the cost of divorcing his loving wife. Still, Mengesha Yohannes's long expectations of promotion to negus of Tigray were shattered for the second time. Mengesha Yohannes's final and desperate rebellion (in concert with ras Sebhat of Agame) in 1898 ended with his captivity and confinement at Addis Ababa, starting from 1899, and then in Ankober where he died as a prisoner in 1906. Mengesha Yohannes's controversial political career, however, left a legacy of Tigrayan identity and autonomy. Indeed, his son leul ras Seyoum Mengesha and his grandson, leul ras Mengesha Seyoum were able to gain the governorship of Tigray, each at different stages of the history of this region (sometimes also partitioned among several governors, relatives of Mengesha Yohannes), until the 1974 Revolution. Mengesha Seyoum played then a role as the leader of an anti-Derg oppositional party, the Ethiopian Democratic Union, which dates back to the mid-1970s.  Succession Problems  The confusion over Ras Mengesh's parentage is due to the fact that his mother Wolete Tekle Haymanot Tomcho (Woizero Tekle) was betrothed to Dejazmatch Gugsa. On the death of Ras Arya Sellassie, son and heir of Yohannes, the title of Ras was conferred on Mengesha and the army of Ras Araya Sellassie was transferred under his command. It was only on his deathbed, at Metemma, that Yohannes declared to Etchege Tewoflos and the important dignitaries present that Mengesha was not the son of his brother Gugsa, but his. He thus acknowledged him as his son and declared him as his heir. Immediately after this announcement, close relatives of Yohannes, such as Fitawrari Meshesha, son of Maru, Yohannes's brother, and Dejach Bogale Araya, son of Ras Araya Dimtsu, maternal uncle of Yohannes, refused to accept Mengesha as the son and heir of Yohannes, claiming that they were equally entitled to succeed the deceased Emperor. Since Gugsa had the same father and mother as Yohannes, the legitimacy of Mengesha would not have been affected if Yohannes had declared that he had chosen Mengesha, his nephew, as his heir. Mengesha, through his mother, had also additional claim to the Imperial lineage. The only reason for claiming Mengesha as his own son was simply ro reveal the truth, which hitherto was kept secret due to the close association that had existed between Yoahannes's elder brother Dejazmatch Gugsa and Woizero Tekle, the mother of Mengesha. Augusus B. Wylde, a correspondent of the British paper, The Manchester Guardian, who had been in Ethiopia as a member of the Hewett Mission of 1884 and later, soon after the Battle of Adwa of 1896, contends that Mengesha was indisputably the actual son Yohannes. Bairu Tefla, on the other hand, although he is aware of the various sources, which assert that Mengesha was the natural son of Yohannes, has placed him as the son of Gugsa on the ground that \\"Most of the old people agree that Mengesha was the son of Gugsa, the eldest brother of the sovereign.\\" Familial rivalry and division of Tigray Even after the submission of Mengesha Yohannes, familial rivalry between the two lines of descent from Emperor Yohannes IV proved to be a difficult issue for Emperor Menelik II and his successors. Yohannes IV was survived by his elder \\"legitimate\\" son Ras Araya Selassie Yohannes and by his younger \\"natural\\" son Mengesha. Ras Araya's son Gugsa Araya, and Ras Mengesha's son Ras Seyoum would for a time divide Tigray between them, with Ras Gugsa Araya ruling the eastern half and Ras Seyoum the western half.https://www.academia.edu/20783536/A_Glimpse_of_History_Power_Treachery_Diplomacy_and_War_in_Ethiopia_1889-1906_RP_Vol._IX_No._XXVII_MMXVI Eventually Mengesha's son Ras Seyoum was made Leul of all Tigray in succession to his father after the death of his cousin Ras Gugsa Araya and after the treason of Gugsa Araya's son, Dejazmatch Haile Selassie Gugsa. In 1935, Haile Selassie Gugsa joined forces with the Italian invaders when they conquered Ethiopia and occupied the country.http://www.aciesedizioni.it/Giochi/Link/AscariContextENG.pdf Ras Mengesha is regarded as the founder of one of the two senior cadet branches of the Ethiopian Imperial Solomonic Dynasty.

Some can also be found in the cecum and appendix. They are below the intestinal stem cells in the intestinal glands (also called crypts of Lieberk√ºhn) and the large eosinophilic refractile granules that occupy most of their cytoplasm. These granules consist of several anti-microbial compounds and other compounds that are known to be important in immunity and host-defense. When exposed to bacteria or bacterial antigens, Paneth cells secrete some of these compounds into the lumen of the intestinal gland, thereby contributing to maintenance of the gastrointestinal barrier. Paneth cells are named after 19th century pathologist, Joseph Paneth. Structure Paneth cells are found throughout the small intestine and the appendix at the base of the intestinal glands. The Paneth cell increase in numbers towards the end of the small intestine. Like the other epithelial cell lineages in the small intestine, Paneth cells originate at the stem cell region near the bottom of the gland. However, unlike the other epithelial cell types, Paneth cells migrate downward from the stem cell region and settle just adjacent to it. This close relationship to the stem cell region is thought to suggest that Paneth cells are important in defending the gland stem cells from microbial damage, although their function is not entirely known. Furthermore, among the four aforementioned intestinal cell lineages, the Paneth cells live the longest (18‚Äì23 days). Function Paneth cells secrete antimicrobial peptides and proteins, which are \\"key mediators of host-microbe interactions, including homeostatic balance with colonizing microbiota and innate immune protection from enteric pathogens.\\" Small intestinal crypts house stem cells that serve to constantly replenish epithelial cells that die and are lost from the villi. Protection of these stem cells is essential for long-term maintenance of the intestinal epithelium, and the location of Paneth cells adjacent to stem cells suggests that they play a critical role in defending epithelial cell renewal. Sensing microbiota Paneth cells sense bacteria via MyD88-dependent toll- like receptor (TLR) activation which then triggers antimicrobial action. Secretions The principal defense molecules secreted by Paneth cells are alpha-defensins, which are known as cryptdins in mice. These peptides have hydrophobic and positively charged domains that can interact with phospholipids in cell membranes. This structure allows defensins to insert into membranes, where they interact with one another to form pores that disrupt membrane function, leading to cell lysis. Due to the higher concentration of negatively charged phospholipids in bacterial than vertebrate cell membranes, defensins preferentially bind to and disrupt bacterial cells, sparing the cells they are functioning to protect. Paneth cells are stimulated to secrete defensins when exposed to bacteria (both Gram positive and negative types) or such bacterial products as lipopolysaccharide, muramyl dipeptide and lipid A. In addition to defensins, Paneth cells secrete lysozyme, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and phospholipase A2. Lysozyme and phospholipase A2 both have clear antimicrobial activity. This battery of secretory molecules gives Paneth cells a potent arsenal against a broad spectrum of agents, including bacteria, fungi and even some enveloped viruses.

Foxe Peninsula is a peninsula found at the southern end of Baffin Island in the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut, Canada. It juts out from the southerly end of the island in a southwestly direction, dividing Foxe Basin and Hudson Strait. Its western extremity is Cape Queen; to the southeast lies the Inuit hamlet of Cape Dorset. Inuksuk Point at the western coast contains more than 100 inuksuit. The peninsula is long and to wide. The peninsula is named for the English explorer Luke Foxe. Inuksuit at the Foxe Peninsula (Baffin Island), Canada Exploration The first exploration of the Foxe Peninsula by Europeans was carried on by Luke Foxe in 1631. Although the exact route of his ship, Charles, remains uncertain, it is believed that he surveyed the coast of the Foxe Peninsula during September 1631 as far as the Cape Dorchester.Nuttall, Mark (ed.). Encyclopedia of the Arctic. Routledge, 2005. Edition published in Taylor & Francis e-Library. . p. 668. and Day, Alan. Historical Dictionary of the Discovery and Exploration of the Northwest Passage. Scarecrow Press, 2006. . p. 97. During his journey Luke Foxe named several features on the coast of the Foxe Peninsula, notably Cape Dorset, King Charles Cape, Cape Queen, and Cape Dorchester.Christy, Miller.

Volume I. Hakluyt Society, 1894. Hakluyt Society, First Series, Number 88. p. 59. However, the exact position of the named places cannot be ascertained accurately due to discrepancies between Foxe ºs MS journal and his written narrative published later.Christy, Miller.

Volume I. Hakluyt Society, 1894. Hakluyt Society, First Series, Number 88. p. 53. Although many of the names invented by Luke Foxe in 1631 are used even today, it is almost certain that the places which hold the names do not match the positions as described by Foxe. Further exploration of the peninsula by Europeans was very sporadic over the next three centuries. Several portions of the coast of the Foxe Peninsula were explored by Donald Baxter MacMillan, who wintered in Schooner Harbour in 1921-1922, and George P. Putnam, who mapped the north coast of the peninsula in 1927.Mills, William James. Exploring Polar Frontiers: A Historical Encyclopedia. Volume 1. A-L. ABC-CLIO, 2003. . p. 54.

They are known for their theatrical performances which often include elaborate props, projections, and comical antics. They are credited with being one of the first \\"Art-punk\\" bands in San Francisco, and were one of the most popular bands of the San Francisco punk scene during the late 1970s and early 1980s. History The Mutants joined together to perform at the San Francisco Poetry Festival in 1977. They quickly became regular performers in the San Francisco punk rock scene, headlining at the Mabuhay Gardens (aka The Fab Mab), The Savoy Tivoli, The Berkeley Square, The Deaf Club, The Temple (aka 1839 Geary Street), The Old Waldorf, The Warfield, and other punk clubs. They were also noted for being one of the few pop bands to ever perform live at Napa State Hospital, a psychiatric hospital. They also opened for such bands as The Ramones, Iggy Pop, New Order, Lene Lovich, The Cramps and the Talking Heads. The Mutants were booked to open for Joy Division's first U.S. tour which was canceled due to Ian Curtis' suicide two days before the tour was to begin. Their first extended play single was on 415 Records and included \\"Insect Lounge\\", \\"New Drug\\" and \\"The New Dark Ages\\". Many compilations, such as Wave Goodbye, Can You Hear Me: Live From the Deaf Club and 415 Music included both live and studio recordings of The Mutants. In 1982, The Mutants' only album, Fun Terminal, was produced with the help of Snakefinger after the first producer, Paul Wexler, who produced their e. p., left the project and was released on MSI Quality Records. In 1983 the Mutants appeared in Rick Schmidt's independent film, Emerald Cities. Footage of a live performance was interspersed throughout the film, showcasing four songs: New Dark Ages; We Need A New Drug; War Against Girls; Sofa Song. Following the release of Fun Terminal, The Mutants embarked on another successful national tour, headlining at major punk venues such as CBGBs and Hurrah. However, the stress encountered while recording Fun Terminal, drug abuse, alcoholism, and family commitments changed the scope of the band. By the mid-eighties many of the original musicians left the band. The three vocalists attempted to keep the band going with new musicians, and new songs were written to feature the female vocalists. An EP documenting the later version of the group was recorded in the studio in 1984, but the material has not been commercially released as of this writing. In 1989 The Mutants had a reunion show at the DNA Lounge in San Francisco. By this time, most of the band was clean and sober. In 2002, Fun Terminal was re-released as a CD (mastered from a vinyl LP copy, as the master tapes were lost but have since been recovered) on White Noise Records and included three additional tracks of live recordings, a 1980 4 song unreleased demo session and the 415 Records-released EP. Interest in the band re-surfaced and The Mutants began once again playing small clubs in San Francisco, such as SOMA Arts, Thee Parkside, Studio Z and Cafe du Nord. A \\"Fab Mab Reunion\\" took place on April 8, 2006 at The Fillmore and featured performances by The Mutants and several other notable bands from the early San Francisco punk scene. Dirk Dirksen and Damon Malloy produced a DVD documentary of The Mutants titled Mutants: Forensic Report which was released in 2007.

John Frederickson was the General Contractor, and his son, Chris Frederickson, also worked on the job as a laborer. George Frederickson was the uncle of John Henry Frederickson, Jr.. In his gift to OCU, George stipulated that the building should be built by his nephew, John Henry. Frederickson Field House facility was at the time of its construction (1959) the largest hyperbolic paraboloid structure on earth. The Frederickson construction company was in fact a pioneering company in the design and building of extremely thin-shell concrete buildings, of which Frederickson Field House was one. Another famous thin-shell concrete structure built by John Henry Frederickson was the First Christian Church, also in Oklahoma City. That building has an \\"eggshell\\" shaped roof that is actually thinner (in proportion) that a real eggshell. The Frederickson Field house venue held 3,400 for basketball. Asked why the scoreboard at the Field House was the first one to have a three digit placement for the team scores, Abe Lemons, the coach at the time, said come to the first game and you will find out. Teams rarely scored in the 100s at the time (late 1950s) but in the first game at the Field House OCU beat Florida State Univ by scoring 129 points in the game.

Bilboes (always plural) or grillos are iron restraints normally placed on a person's ankles. They have commonly been used as leg shackles to restrain prisoners for different purposes until the modern ages. Bilboes were also used on slave ships, such as the Henrietta Marie. According to legend, the device was invented in Bilbao, Basque Country within Spain, and was imported into England by the ships of the Spanish Armada for use on prospective English prisoners. However, the Oxford English Dictionary notes that the term was used in English well before then. Bilboes consist of a pair of \\"U\\"-shaped iron bars (shackles) with holes in the ends, through which an iron rod is inserted. The rod mostly has a large knob on one end, and a slot in the other end into which a wedge or a padlock is driven to secure the assembly. Bilboes occur in different sizes, ranging from regular large ones to smaller sizes particularly fitting women's ankles and even sizes to restrain the wrists. The rod can also be fastened to a wall or a rigid trestle as it was mostly used in prisons. This way the person is restrained to stay put, while only allowing movement of the feet sideways inside the limited range the rod allows for. Bilboes used as public punishment in former times combined physical discomfort with public humiliation. The person was often restrained barefoot, which added to the humiliation. They were popular in England and America in the colonial and early revolutionary periods (such as in the Massachusetts Bay Colony). They were used in England to \\"punyssche transgressours ageynste ye Kinges Maiesties lawes\\". Bilboes appear occasionally in literature, including Hamlet (Act V, Scene 2: \\"Methought I lay worse than the mutinies in the bilboes\\") and the journals of Captain Cook. at Project Gutenberg A notable case of excessive use is documented from Trinidad under British administration by governor Thomas Picton during the criminal procedure against eighteen-year-old Louisa Calderon in 1801. The former maid of governor Picton was accused of theft from his household and interrogated. She was also subjected to the picket torture, which first led to an extorted confession. Subsequently she was left restrained in bilboes over the continuous period of eight months while the legal inquest was in progress. The shackles were rigidly fastened to the wall of her confinement cell, so she was forced to remain in one place for the entire duration of her imprisonment. The charges were eventually dropped, so Louisa Calderon was released from her incarceration and the bilboes were taken off after months of being incessantly restrained. This excessive form of incarceration along with the preceding torture was later assessed as inhumane in a juridic reappraisal. Bilboes were used to restrain slaves on slave ships. Components forming more than eighty bilboes have been recovered from the Henrietta Marie, an English slave ship that was wrecked in the Florida Keys in 1700 after delivering slaves to Jamaica. Bilboes were also found in the Molasses Reef Wreck, a Spanish wreck in the Turks and Caicos Islands from very early in the 16th century, which may have been a slave ship hunting Lucayans in the Bahamas. Bilboes were used to fasten two slaves together, so that the eighty-plus bilboes found on the Henrietta Marie would have restrained up to 160 slaves. Bilboes were usually not placed on every slave transported, nor were they left on for all of a voyage. Only the slaves that were strongest and presumably most likely to revolt or escape were kept in bilboes for all of a voyage.

Danish settlers who arrived in 1895 named their settlement after Baron Ludvig Holberg, a distinguished Danish historian and dramatist. Holberg is on the long, winding, unpaved road to Cape Scott Provincial Park, San Josef Bay and Winter Harbour. Nearby Ronning Gardens, an anomaly in the west coast temperate rainforest, was created by Norwegian settler Bernt Ronning around 1910. Holberg has always been noted for logging and copious amounts of precipitation. During the Cold War, the Royal Canadian Air Force established RCAF Station Holberg, a Pinetree Line radar base. Up on one of the roads of Holberg is a small school called San Josef Elementary. Holberg is serviced by an AM radio station, CFHG 1490. CFHG began operations on April 16, 1963 from studios at CFS Holberg. The station primarily aired the programs of Vancouver CBC Radio station CBU, but it also aired local programs produced by volunteer staff at the station. CFHG, which produced up to 28 hours of local programming per week in the beginning, gradually increased its local programming content to as much as 68 hours a week by 1984. When CFS Holberg closed and was mostly dismantled in 1990 due to budget cuts, CFHG was sold to Western Forest Products Ltd. and became a community-owned full rebroadcaster of CBU. Like other CBC Radio One repeaters on Vancouver Island, CFHG now rebroadcasts CBCV-FM Victoria.CFHG Radio - 14901950 - A History of Holberg - 30th Anniversary Yearbook Visitor guidance Visitors to Holberg typically pass through fabulous natural parks that are made accessible via logging roads.

The precise form of atomic formulas depends on the logic under consideration; for propositional logic, for example, the atomic formulas are the propositional variables.

He has won multiple Emmy Awards during his broadcast career. Life and career Peterson has worked at Washington, D.C. local news stations for most of his career. He worked for CBS-affiliated WUSA (Channel 9) as the news anchor for 35 years before switching to rival station WJLA (Channel 7) after station management for the former station decided to cut his airtime. Peterson graduated from the College of the Holy Cross and attended Georgetown University without finishing a degree program. He became news director for AM radio station WNEB in his hometown of Worcester, Massachusetts before moving to CBS's Boston affiliate, WEEI. He also served as an officer in the United States Marine Corps. Peterson first arrived in Washington in the fall of 1969, working as a reporter for both WTOP radio and television, and within two years was named co-anchor with fellow staffer Max Robinson of The Big News, which later evolved into Eyewitness News. He would remain the main anchor at Channel 9 for 33 years amid many changes on and off-camera. For most of that period he co-anchored with Maureen Bunyan, with whom he was reunited on the 6 p.m. news on WJLA-TV in December 2004.

Description The canyon is actually just a fairly short (less than ) section of the larger Great West Canyon. That canyon is located between two peaks (the North Guardian Angel and the South Guardian Angel) on the Kolob Plateau. The Left Fork North Creek flows through The Subway (and the Great West Canyon). The Subway is so named for its tube-like, undercut slot canyons. Access The Subway from the bottom, September 2012 While short in length, long approach and exit hikes are necessary to access The Subway. Canyoneering groups acknowledge two popular routes for visiting The Subway. The through route, for advanced hikers, involves a one-way hike downstream from the Wildcat Canyon Trailhead (). The easier route accesses the lower section of the Subway from downstream, beginning at the Left Fork Trailhead (). Both trailheads are located just off Kolob Terrace Road (also known as the Kolob Reservoir Road), a road which runs north from Utah State Route 9 in Virgin through the national park and eventually, after passing by the Kolob Reservoir, connects with other roads that run farther north to Cedar City and Utah State Route 14. A Back Country Permit is required to visit The Subway. Permits may be obtained at the Zion Canyon Visitor Center, but may be difficult to obtain during peak visitation months.

Brown is a 30-year veteran of motion picture production and he uses his experiences on many well-known films to illustrate his points. The book is a wealth of information and covers topics ranging from breaking down a film script to creating a budget, finding locations, dealing with the personalities, and hiring the crew. It also includes a large appendix, glossary, and index. Scheduling The books goes into detail describing a shooting sequence and how to recognize one. This is the unit of the script that is used in scheduling. Brown states that a shooting sequence is a piece of the script that has a single action, uses essentially the same cast throughout its length, is contiguous in time, and can be shot in one place. Borrowing on studies of ancient Greek drama, he calls these the four \\"unities\\" of a shooting sequence.
