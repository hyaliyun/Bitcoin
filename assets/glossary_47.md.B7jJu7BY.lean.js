As such, they are closely associated with the advertising and other promotions used to gain mind share in their target market.Brand/Story: Cases and Explorations in Fashion Branding By Joseph Hancock Fairchild Books, Bloomsbury Publishing, Inc. 2016 They often operate from an ideology, hoping to attract a relatively high number of people and ultimately become a recognised social phenomenon. A lifestyle brand is an ideology created by a particular organisation's brand (Schmitt, 2012). An organisation achieves a lifestyle brand by focusing on evoking an emotional connection with its customers,(Kim & Brandon, 2010) creating a desire for a consumer to be affiliated with a particular group or brand.(Austin & Matos, 2013) Furthermore, the consumer will believe that their identity will be reinforced if they publicly associate themselves with a particular lifestyle brand, such as expression by using a brand on social media.(Catalin & Andreea, 2014) As individuals have different identities based on their personal experiences, choices or background (including social class, ethnicity or culture), an organisation must understand to whom it directs its brand. By operating off a lifestyle brand ideology, an organisation's ultimate goal is to become a recognised social phenomenon. Lifestyle brand marketing uses market research to segment target markets based on psychographics rather than demographics. Definition Lifestyle brands operate from the idea that each individual has an identity based on their choices, experiences, and background (e.g. ethnicity, social class, subculture, nationality, etc.). Lifestyle brands focus on evoking emotional connections between a consumer and that consumer's desire to affiliate him or herself with a group. Some recent contributions have defined lifestyle brands as one of the possible ways of consumer self-expression: customers believe that their identity will be reinforced or supplemented if they publicly associate themselves with a lifestyle brand or other symbol-intensive brands. ; Factors that influence consumer decision process It is evident that consumers in our modern world continually face multiple decisions with regard to product choice due to many competing products, such aspects as a products attributes have been shown to be involved in the consumer decision process (Catalin & Andreea, 2014). A number of factors can be identified that affect a consumer's choice of product brand which influences their lifestyle. Consumers are known to choose a brand that is acceptable to their self-image that they are trying to portray. This has left companies having to re-establish and position their products to ensure they meet the lifestyle a consumer is trying to obtain. They have an opportunity to refine their target market which would limit competition due to a reduced number in consumers who would be attracted to their specific brand because of the way they might perceive their lifestyle. Consumers have a tendency to evaluate product attributes as opposed to a case by case assessment (Ainslie and Rosii, 2005). There is the need for brands to be understood and how they can be influential with regard to consumer's decision making considerations. Three processes are identified as being intertwined in choice behaviour. These are psychological, sociological and economic processes (Keller, 2008). Within these three processes lifestyle of the consumer also becomes intertwined with consumers tending to choose a brand they feel is congruent with their self-image, their identity ‚Äì who they feel they are and what they connect with the most. Vyncke (2002) suggests that a consumer's values, goals and vision for their life along with aesthetic style are all reflective of individual lifestyle. ; Consumer self-expression Consumers use brands to express their identity (Chernev, Hamilton & Gal, 2011). The need for self-expression can be related to the need for acceptance within society and the societal view on brands and how different brands portray income or wealth. An advantage to lifestyle brands is that consumers can express their identity in a number of ways. This is a dominating factor that would lead on to the consumer adopting a certain lifestyle. Brands allow for customers to express themselves and portray their identity and lifestyle (Keller, 2008). Lifestyle brands in particular portray a type of meaning that allows a particular reference group to attach themselves based on their lifestyle, values or beliefs (Escalas, & Bettman, 2005). ; Perceived brand value If a consumer loves fashion this will have a positive effect on his/her willingness to pay for a luxury, top-end brand. In order for a lifestyle brand to be successful and dominate market share it needs to enhance customers experiences and provide more than just a product. Consumers are more willing and likely to purchase a brand that establishes itself as to value and satisfaction. Brand value is defined as comparing focal brands with unbranded products that have had the same level or same ways of marketing to consumers, as well as adopting the same product attributes (Yoo and Donthu, 2001). Luxury brands target those that have an extreme lifestyle. Price is never a factor. Three categories are identified as measuring brand value: brand loyalty, perceived value and brand awareness/association. Consumers associate themselves with luxury fashion brands to portray their lifestyle and separate them from the rest (Vigneron & Johnson, 2004). Social value is an aspect that relates to consumers' desire to obtain luxury brands that they hope will offer them a symbolic part of a group or culture. There are emotional factors that are connected to the consumption of a luxury brand: for example those that bring pleasure or excitement (Choi & Kim 2003; Kim et al., 2010; Vigneron & Johnson, 2004). Consumers who purchase luxury brands tend to have a strong social function within their social class. ; Retail brands Lifestyle retail branding is the way in which retailers refine their products or services to interest lifestyles in specific market segments (Helman & Chernatony, 1999). Examples of lifestyle retail brands include Laura Ashley, GAP and Benneton. These retailers offer a distinct and recognised set of values to consumers. Over time, a number of retailers have come up with their own brand strategies and are now seen as lifestyle retail brands because they are targeting consumers who adopt their brand to align themselves with a lifestyle they want to obtain (Helman & Chernatony, 1999).  Psychology  It is important for an organisation to understand its brand's role amongst consumers. To achieve this, an organisation must use the following aspects of the lifestyle brand model (Schmitt, 2012). ; Brand categorisation This is defined as a consumer sorting products or brands into categories, based on their past experiences with that brand (Schmitt, 2012). It is used to avoid confusion, as consumers may be overwhelmed when comparing one product with an extensive range of other brands of the same product (Nenycz-Thiel & Romaniuk, 2016). Categorisation helps consumers evaluate the quality of the product (Catalin & Andreea, 2014). For example, a consumer may choose to purchase an Apple iPhone over a Huawei mobile phone, as they may believe that the iPhone has a better camera quality (Nenycz-Thiel & Romaniuk, 2016). ; Brand affect This aspect is defined as the effect or influence a brand may have upon an organisation and its consumers (Orzan, Platton, Stefanescu & Orzan, 2016). For example, Whole Foods can affect a consumer by going the extra mile to offer organic foods products that suit that particular consumer's needs (Yi, Batra & Siqing, 2015). ; Brand personality This is when a brand encompasses a consistent set of traits in which the consumer can relate (Cohen, 2014). For example, Crossfit is a lifestyle brand which encompasses the idea of pushing yourself for your fitness. This idea is consistent on a global level. Through this lifestyle, consumers or participants have the opportunity to feel a part of a group of healthy, motivated fitness fanatics (Qing, Rong & Xiaobing, 2015). ; Brand symbolism This is defined as the strong symbolism that a brand transmits to its consumers, which is adopted for its social benefits (Kubat & Swaminathan, 2015). It allows consumers to feel as though they can express themselves through a form of identity, whilst being provided with a sense of belonging to a group (Wu, Klink & Guo, 2013). For example, Tiffany & Co. are a jewellery brand which offer affordable and expensive, high-quality jewellery products. When a person sees a consumer wearing its product in public, that person may aim to own a piece of Tiffany & Co. jewellery themselves, with the aim to seek social benefits or fit into a particular group (Athaide & Klink, 2012). ; Brand attachment Attachment is brought about when people form an emotional connection between themselves and a brand (Malar, Krohmer, Hoyer & Nyffenegger, 2011). For example, Coca-Cola uses advertisements to portray its happy lifestyle to consumers. These advertisements are used to form an emotional connection with the audience. Through the use of the ‚ÄúOpen happiness‚Äù slogan, consumers may believe that by purchasing and consuming a Coca-Cola drink, they will feel like they are happy and having fun (Malar, Krohmer, Hoyer & Nyffenegger, 2011).  Examples While some lifestyle brands purposely reference existing groups or cultures, others create a disruption within the status quo and propose an innovative viewpoint on the world. The driving force may be the product, the shopping experience, the service, the communication or a combination of these elements. These are often result from visionary goals of the CEO or founder. Early on, Apple's founder Steve Jobs sought to integrate the company's innovations into the industries of music, entertainment, and telecommunications.Cuneo, Alice Z.; Elkin, Tobi; Kim, Hank; Stanley, T.L. (December 15, 2003), \\"Apple transcends as lifestyle brand.\\" Advertising Age. 74(50):S-2-S-6 In 2002, he gifted each 7th- and 8th-grader in the state of Maine with a laptop, in an effort to show that it wasn't \\"about the technology, it's about what people can do with it.\\" Lee Clow‚Äîthe chairman of Omnicom Group's TBWA Worldwide and Apple marketing partner‚Äîsaid that Jobs had \\"a very rigorous view of Apple's tone of voice and the way it talks with people,\\" calling it \\"very human, very accessible.\\" Burton has built its lifestyle brand by drawing on the snowboarding subculture and Quiksilver has done the same with the surfing community. Some lifestyle brands align themselves with an ideology. Patagonia proposes an environmentally friendly way of life. Volcom, with the promise \\"Youth Against Establishment\\", gives a label and a sense of belonging to those who are \\"against\\" the world of adults. One popular source for lifestyle brands is also national identity. Victoria's Secret purposely evoked the English upper class in its initial branding efforts, while Burberry is recalling the hip London culture. Social or personal image is also a reference point for some lifestyle brands. In the 1990s, Abercrombie & Fitch successfully resuscitated a 1950s ideal ‚Äîthe white, masculine ‚Äúbeefcake‚Äù‚Äî during a time of political correctness and rejection of 1950s orthodoxy, creating a lifestyle brand based on a preppy, young, Ivy- League lifestyle. Their retail outlets reflect this lifestyle through their luxurious store environment, attractive store associates (models), and their black and white photographs featuring young people \\"living the Abercrombie & Fitch lifestyle\\". In doing so, Abercrombie & Fitch has created an outlet for those who lead, or wish to lead or wish to dream about leading this lifestyle. Companies like home furnishing associate themselves with the term ‚Äúlifestyle branding‚Äù when they are developing their brand portfolio (‚ÄúLexington Offering,‚Äù 2009). A furniture company is likely to align new product lines with lifestyle collections that are associated with fashion icons, celebrities and well-known interior designers. For consumers this is reassuring and entices them to purchase home furnishings to be like these iconic influencers. Furniture companies have said that it helps them connect with those consumers who associate other categories with these celebrities. It is their way of tapping into new markets that have not yet been reached (Combs, 2010). Companies that have celebrity names associated with them provides a certain degree of guarantee to the brand (Clow et al., 2011). A company called Doman Home Furnishings launched a campaign about food and kitchen products to enhance its brand as a lifestyle choice (‚ÄúDomain Home,‚Äù 2004). The campaign used models which had a caption along the lines of ‚Äòa slice of life‚Äô. This allowed consumers to gain a good understanding of the brand and the lifestyle that it could offer. Home furnishing companies use lifestyle merchandising to promote brand extension. Furthermore, the brand is communicated to consumers through using a designer who is associated with also creating fashion-apparel products. Therefore, this creates a connection between the fashion and homeware brands for these consumers are already associating with or are familiar with the fashion-apparel products.  Expansion  One key indication that a brand has become a lifestyle is when it successfully expands beyond its original product. For example, Nike used to be a product-based company, focusing on making running shoes. But over time, the company and its logo has become associated with the athletic subculture. That has allowed Nike to expand into related athletic categories, such as sports equipment and apparel. Gaiam started out as a yoga company but has had great success in developing a lifestyle brand, which has allowed it to move into other markets as varied as solar power and green building supplies. Nautica started out as a collection of 6 outerwear pieces but built itself into a global lifestyle brand by having collections for men, women, kids, home and accessories. A company's status as a lifestyle brand isn't achieved by providing a wide range of products but by the benefit and symbolic value that the customer associates with the brand.

Specifically, it compares the probability of finding particular evidence if the accused were guilty, versus if they were not guilty. An example would be the probability of finding a person's hair at the scene, if guilty, versus if just passing through the scene. Another issue would be finding a person's DNA where they lived, regardless of committing a crime there. __TOC__ Explanation Among evidence scholars, the study of evidence in recent decades has become broadly interdisciplinary, incorporating insights from psychology, economics, and probability theory. One area of particular interest and controversy has been Bayes' theorem. \\"Bayes' Theorem in the Court of Appeal  Law Articles\\", Bernard Robertson, Tony Vignaux (on R v Adams), LawIntl-2451. Bayes' theorem is an elementary proposition of probability theory. It provides a way of updating, in light of new information, one‚Äôs probability that a proposition is true. Evidence scholars have been interested in its application to their field, either to study the value of rules of evidence, or to help determine facts at trial. Suppose, that the proposition to be proven is that defendant was the source of a hair found at the crime scene. Before learning that the hair was a genetic match for the defendant‚Äôs hair, the factfinder believes that the odds are 2 to 1 that the defendant was the source of the hair. If they used Bayes‚Äô theorem, they could multiply those prior odds by a ‚Äúlikelihood ratio‚Äù in order to update her odds after learning that the hair matched the defendant‚Äôs hair. The likelihood ratio is a statistic derived by comparing the odds that the evidence (expert testimony of a match) would be found if the defendant was the source with the odds that it would be found if defendant was not the source. If it is ten times more likely that the testimony of a match would occur if the defendant was the source than if not, then the factfinder should multiply their prior odds by ten, giving posterior odds of 20 to one. Bayesian skeptics have objected to this use of Bayes‚Äô theorem in litigation on a variety of grounds. These run from jury confusion and computational complexity to the assertion that standard probability theory is not a normatively satisfactory basis for adjudication of rights. Bayesian enthusiasts have replied on two fronts. First, they have said that whatever its value in litigation, Bayes' theorem is valuable in studying evidence rules. For example, it can be used to model relevance. It teaches that the relevance of evidence that a proposition is true depends on how much the evidence changes the prior odds, and that how much it changes the prior odds depends on how likely the evidence would be found (or not) if the proposition were true. These basic insights are also useful in studying individual evidence rules, such as the rule allowing witnesses to be impeached with prior convictions. Second, they have said that it is practical to use Bayes' theorem in a limited set of circumstances in litigation (such as integrating genetic match evidence with other evidence), and that assertions that probability theory is inappropriate for judicial determinations are nonsensical or inconsistent. Some observers believe that in recent years (i) the debate about probabilities has become stagnant, (ii) the protagonists in the probabilities debate have been talking past each other, (iii) not much is happening at the high-theory level, and (iv) the most interesting work is in the empirical study of the efficacy of instructions on Bayes‚Äô theorem in improving jury accuracy. However, it is possible that this skepticism about the probabilities debate in law rests on observations of the arguments made by familiar protagonists in the legal academy. In fields outside of law, work on formal theories relating to uncertainty continues unabated. One important development has been the work on \\"soft computing\\" such as has been carried on, for example, at Berkeley under Lotfi Zadeh's BISC (Berkeley Initiative in Soft Computing). Another example is the increasing amount of work, by people both in and outside law, on \\"argumentation\\" theory. Also, work on Bayes nets continues. Some of this work is beginning to filter into legal circles. See, for example, the many papers on formal approaches to uncertainty (including Bayesian approaches) in the Oxford journal: Law, Probability and Risk . Examples There are some famous cases where Bayes' theorem can be applied. * In the medical examples, a comparison is made between the evidence of cancer suggested by mamograms (5% show positive) versus the general risk of having cancer (1% in general): the ratio is 1:5, or 20% risk, of having breast cancer when a mammogram shows a positive result. * A court case which argued the probabilities, with DNA evidence, is R v Adams.

One type of transport originated in the 19th century, firstly in Berlin and followed by Vienna, where rail routes were created that could be used independently from other traffic. In the 1960s and 1970s Stadtbahn networks were created again but now by upgrading tramways or light railways. This process includes adding segments built to rapid transit standards ‚Äìusually as part of a process of conversion to a metro railway‚Äì mainly by the building of metro-grade tunnels in the central city area. In the first years after the opening of the tunnel sections, often regular trams vehicles (but adapted for tunnel service) were used. These trams were followed by specially designed vehicles like the Stadtbahn B series. By the 1980s virtually all cities had abandoned the long- term goal of establishing a full-scale metro system due to the excessive costs associated with converting the tramways. Most Stadtbahn systems are now a mixture of tramway-like operations in suburban and peripheral areas and a more metro-like mode of operation in city centres, with underground stations. This 20th century Stadtbahn concept eventually spread from Germany to other European countries, where it became known as pre-metro.  History Cologne Stadtbahn at Bensberg in 2005 A train of Stuttgart Stadtbahn in 2002  1920s: Berlin and Vienna cross-city lines  The term Stadtbahn first arose in the first half of the 20th century as a name for the cross-city lines in Berlin and Vienna. The Berlin Stadtbahn line is an elevated heavy rail line linking the East and the West. Long distance, regional, suburban, and urban services (S-Bahn) are operated on it. The Wiener Stadtbahn (Vienna) was in the beginning a system of heavy rail lines circling the city, free of level crossings, operated by steam trains. After World War I the Wiental, Donaukanal and G√ºrtel lines were converted into an electric light rail system with tram- like two-axle cars (which on line 18G until 1945 switched into the tram network at Gumpendorfer Strasse station). In the 1970s to 1990s the infrastructure was updated, and the lines were partially relocated: they are now part of the Vienna U-Bahn services 'U4' and 'U6'. The Vorortelinie line remained heavy rail and is now part of the Vienna S-Bahn.  1960s: modern Stadtbahn  Since the 1960s the term Stadtbahn has become identified with a second, now dominant, meaning, which is a reference to underground urban rail network that is used by conventional trams but planned at the outset to be eventually converted into a metro system (which may or may not be implemented in the end). Post-World War II transport policies in West German cities aimed for a separation of public and private transport. The conflicts that arose between increasing car usage and the existing tramway systems led to the so- called 'second level' concept for future light rail schemes. This concept focused on the grade separation, i.e., elevation and/or tunneling of tram lines. Munich and Nuremberg decided to build pure, full-scale U-Bahn (metro) systems. Berlin and Hamburg planned expansions of their existing U-Bahn networks, while most West German cities decided to upgrade their tramway networks step by step, linking new 'second level' infrastructure to existing sections. While some cities regarded this solution as an interim step that would lead to a fully separated U-Bahn (metro) network independent of other forms of transport, others planned for a lesser degree of separation, one that would accommodate additional tram-like sections in the long run. For both the interim and the long-term based concepts, the following terms came into use: \\"U-Stra√üenbahn\\" or \\"Untergrund-Stra√üenbahn\\" (underground tramway, abbreviated as \\"U-Strab\\"), \\"Schnellstra√üenbahn\\" (rapid tramway) and finally Stadtbahn. (In French-speaking countries, these concepts were also known as \\"pre-metro\\", stressing their interim nature.) Some operators and cities decided to identify the term Stadtbahn with the eventual goal of installing an U-Bahn so that both the original U-Bahn logo (e.g. Frankfurt U-Bahn, Cologne Stadtbahn, Hanover Stadtbahn) and the derived U-Stadtbahn logos (e.g. North Rhine-Westphalia, Stuttgart Stadtbahn; see example above) mark station entries and stops. The numbering scheme for Stadtbahn services was prefixed with a 'U', except in the Cologne Stadtbahn, Bielefeld Stadtbahn, and Hanover Stadtbahn.  1980s: Renaissance of the tramway  By the 1980s conventional tramways had been seen by decision-makers as overloaded systems for almost two decades. However, public attention focused on them at this time for two reasons. The Stadtbahn cities' second level plans faced unexpected complications in the form of lengthy construction work, budgetary problems for tunnel projects, and protests against elevated sections. At the same time, the smaller cities which had not started Stadtbahn plans reassessed their options in relation to their existing tram systems. East German cities had no 1960s-style Stadtbahn plans in place, and the fleets and the infrastructure were in need of massive investment and improvement. After the reunification of Germany in 1990, the use of the Stadtbahn term became popular in the former East Germany as well, as in Erfurt and Dresden. Stadtbahn in this wider meaning is thus not a clearly defined concept, but a vague one linked to a set of attributes, much in the same way that \\"Stra√üenbahn\\" (tram) is linked to very different, sometimes mutually incompatible attributes. A system that is called Stadtbahn today may not have all of the Stadtbahn attributes: barrier-free access, higher cruising speed than tramways, doors on both sides of the train, driver's cabs on both ends, higher operating voltage, wider cars with comfortable seats, and so on.  1990s: The tram goes railway  In 1992 Karlsruhe started an innovative new service, using both heavy and light rail infrastructure, to link the wider region to the city. The vehicles were designed to comply with technical specifications for the (federal) heavy railway and for light rail (communal tramways). Such vehicles are called Dual- System Light Rail Vehicles. The meaning of Stadtbahn was enlarged to encompass this new type of \\"tram-train\\" service. In other regions, stimulated by the Karlsruhe example and planning to copy it, other terms are in use: Stadt- Umland-Bahn (city-to-region railway, e.g. Erlangen, also in discussion to connect the nearer surroundings of Munich, as far as not supplied with S-Bahn services so far, with the existing public transport there), Regional-Stadtbahn (regional light rail, e.g. Braunschweig). Stra√üenbahn (tram) and Stadtbahn in the Karlsruhe region are differentiated more by the nature of their city- border crossings only, and not by the technical dimension (Dual-System Light Rail Vehicles). Only those services that extend into the suburbs are called Stadtbahn. They are represented by the 'S' logo that is used for 'S-Bahn' (Stadtschnellbahn) in the rest of Germany and therefore partially conflict with it, as it has acquired a second meaning in Karlsruhe.  2000s: The Tram logo  The Tram logo As part of the redevelopment of their main city stations, national railway company Deutsche Bahn adopted a new logo to indicate Stra√üenbahn (tram) connections: a square containing the word 'Tram'. Although the design is the same nationwide, the colour varies from city to city to match local public transport operators' systems of colour-coding. The logo is part of the 'S logo scheme' initially developed by Berlin public transport operator BVG, based on the established logos for urban metro ('U', for U-Bahn) and suburban metro ('S', for S-Bahn) and including bus ('Bus') and ferry ('F', for F√§hre) operations. As the new logos became part of the information systems at more and more main railway stations, an increasing number of cities and public transport operators came to accept and adopt the scheme. As far as the Stadtbahn terminology problem is concerned, however, the scheme serves only to add further confusion to the matter, since there is no nationwide logo for Stadtbahn services. The result appears to be a contraction in the use of the term Stadtbahn, especially in cities where it has been used in its wider 1980s 'light-rail system' meaning. In cities where Stadtbahn has the 1960s 'pre-metro' meaning, both the 'U' (for U-Bahn) and the 'Tram' logo are used on city maps (to indicate the location of stops) and on railway station signage (to indicate connections). The 'U' Logo is normally used both where stops or stations are underground and where they serve 'second-level' pre-metro type lines. In cities which prefix all their Stadtbahn line numbers with a 'U' (e.g. Stuttgart), the 'U' logo is used at stops on services that are essentially 'classic' tram lines, not 'second-level' at all.  Regionalstadtbahn  The concept of Regionalstadtbahnen (also known by RegioStadtbahn or other names) arose as a result of the harmonisation or integration of railway lines into Stadtbahn networks. In the area of Cologne‚ÄìBonn a single operational system (of so-called above ground lines or Hochflurstrecken) was created by the Cologne Stadtbahn and the Bonn Stadtbahn, opened in 1974, from the conversion of two former railway lines (the Rheinuferbahn and Vorgebirgsbahn belonging to the old K√∂ln-Bonner Eisenbahnen). Further developments led to tram-train networks that rather resembled an S-Bahn. This idea was first realised in 1992 in Karlsruhe (Karlsruhe Stadtbahn), where as part of the Karlsruhe model even so-called dual system railbuses were used, which in addition to the direct current of Stra√üenbahn lines (750 V) could also draw power from the 15-kV-alternating current from normal DB catenary. In Karlsruhe this network reached as far as Heilbronn, away, where a Stadtbahn network was created going out from this line. Both in Karlsruhe and in Heilbronn the Stadtbahn filled both the roles of a classic tramway system as well as an S-Bahn. The Karlsruhe mixed- operation concept was also adopted by the Saarbahn in Saarbr√ºcken. This model is today referred to in France as the tram-train. Zwickau diesel tram-train (Vogtlandbahn) Other Stadtbahn networks in Germany without tunnels, but which incorporate railway lines, are found in: * Kassel (Kassel RegioTram with hybrid railcars for the transition between electrified and non-electrified routes) * Zwickau (Diesel railbuses of the Vogtlandbahn on tramways in the city centre) * Chemnitz (Variotrams trams fitted with railway equipment, which City-Bahn Chemnitz runs daily on the Chemnitz‚ÄìStollberg/Erzgeb. line) * Gotha (Trams in Gotha/Th√ºringerwaldbahn), above ground tramway (24 km long), in existence since 1924, to Waltershausen, Friedrichroda and Bad Tabarz * Nordhausen in the South Harz. This tramway network run by the Harz Narrow Gauge Railways is notable because it supplements the diesel-hybrid cars with steam engines.  Legal terms  Although a precise legal definition of Stadtbahn was planned in the 1970s, there is currently no such definition. By law, the BOStrab regulates all Stadtbahn systems as tram systems, as long as they are light rail rather than heavy rail.  Difference between Stadtbahn and S-Bahn in Germany  While the names Stadtbahn and S-Bahn have common origin (\\"rapid urban train\\"), their meaning today is different. S-Bahn is commuter rail, usually integrated into the railway network and mostly operated by the German national railway company Deutsche Bahn. Stadtbahn, on the other hand, generally use light rail vehicles (either high-floor or low-floor), and are usually integrated into the tram network, though the Stadtbahn portions do not operate with street running like trams do. They also differ in legal status: S-Bahn systems are governed under the rail rules of the Eisenbahn-Bau- und Betriebsordnung (EBO, \\"Ordinance on the Construction and Operation of Railways\\"), while Stadtbahn systems are tramways by law governed under the regulations of Verordnung √ºber den Bau und Betrieb der Stra√üenbahnen (BOStrab, \\"Ordinance on the Construction and Operation of Trams\\").

In the mid-15th century it was one of the six original members of the influential Bursfelde Congregation, a Benedictine reform movement. After three prosperous centuries, based largely on its possession of a relic of the blood of Christ and a healing spring dedicated to John the Baptist, which made it a centre of pilgrimage, it was dissolved in 1561 during the secularisation brought about by the Reformation. The monastic library is preserved in the Danish Royal Library in Copenhagen. The abbey is famous for its carved altar, dating from early in the 14th century, still in place in the church.

The first fossils of Saichania were found in the early 1970s in Mongolia. In 1977 the type species Saichania chulsanensis was named. The description of this species has been based on limited fossil material; especially the rear of the animal is not well known. Saichania was over five metres long and weighed over two tonnes. It was more robustly built than other members of the Ankylosauridae. Neck vertebrae, shoulder girdle, ribs and breast bones were fused or firmly connected. Its body was flat and low-slung, standing on four short legs. The forelimbs were very powerful. The head was protected by bulbous armour tiles. It could defend itself against predators like Tarbosaurus with a tail-club. On the torso keeled osteoderms were present. Saichania bit off plants in its desert habitat with a horny beak and processed them in its wide hindgut. History of discovery Cast of the holotype of Saichania in the Museum of Evolution, Warsaw In 1970 and 1971 a Polish- Mongolian expedition found ankylosaurian fossils in the Gobi Desert near Chulsan, or Khulsan. The type species Saichania chulsanensis was named and described by the Polish palaeontologist Teresa Marya≈Ñska in 1977, along with the related species Tarchia kielanae. The generic name means \\"the beautiful one\\" in Mongolian, referring to the pristine state of preservation of the type specimen. The specific name refers to the provenance near Chulsa. The holotype of Saichania chulsanensis, specimen GI SPS 100/151, was found in a layer of the Barun Goyot Formation, dating from the late Campanian, about seventy-three million years old. It consists of a skull and the anterior part of the postcranial skeleton: seven neck vertebrae, ten back vertebrae, the left shoulder girdle, the left forelimb, the two cervical halfrings and extensive armour in life position. The holotype is largely articulated. Referred specimens include ZPAL MgD-I/114 consisting of an undescribed fragmentary skull roof and associated armour, and an undescribed, almost complete skeleton with skull, specimen PIN 3142/251. Later, also the juvenile specimen MPC-D 100/1305 was referred and extensively described in 2011, seeming for the first time to provide complete information on the postcranial skeleton.Carpenter, K., Hayashi, S., Kobayashi, Y., Marya≈Ñska, T., Barsbold, R., Sato, K., and Obata, I., 2011, \\"Saichania chulsanensis (Ornithischia, Ankylosauridae) from the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia\\", Palaeontographica, Abteilung A, 294(1-3): 1-61 However, in 2014 Victoria Megan Arbour concluded that the describers had been misled by the skeleton having been completed with a skull cast of GI SPS 100/151, and that the remainder of the fossil belonged to some other ankylosaur, possibly Pinacosaurus. On the other hand, Arbour added to the number of possible Saichania specimens by referring PIN 3142/250, a skull previously seen as a Tarchia exemplar. This would imply that Saichania, formerly thought to occur solely in the Barun Goyot Formation at Khulsan, is also known from the Nemegt Formation at Khermeen Tsav. Saichania would then be the only ankylosaur definitely known from the Nemegt, its occurrence thus spanning the time of the Campanian‚ÄìMaastrichtian transition, and early Maastrichtian (Nemegtian) period. Arbour also considered the Chinese taxa Tianzhenosaurus youngi Pang & Cheng 1998 and Shanxia tianzhenensis Barrett, You, Upchurch & Burton 1998 to be junior synonyms of Saichania.Arbour, Victoria Megan, 2014. Systematics, evolution, and biogeography of the ankylosaurid dinosaurs. Ph.D thesis, University of Alberta The referral of PIN 3142/250 to Saichania was contested by Penkalski & Tumanova who considered this specimen to be referable to a new species of Tarchia, T. teresae. Description=Size, build and distinguishing traits Size comparison of GI SPS 100/151 and MPC-D 100/1305 Saichania was a large ankylosaurid. Marya≈Ñska estimated its length at seven meters. Other estimates roughly confirmed this, stating a maximum length of about long.Seebacher, F. (2001). \\"A new method to calculate allometric length‚Äìmass relationships of dinosaurs.\\" Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 21(1): 51‚Äì60. However, Gregory S. Paul in 2010 gave a lower estimate of 5.2 metres, with a weight of two tonnes.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 231 Finds of tail clubs of gigantic individuals suggest larger sizes but their reference to Saichania cannot be substantiated as the holotype, the only specimen sufficiently described, only consists of the front of the animal. Saichania shared the general ankylosaurid build, being a low-slung, broad, heavily armoured dinosaur, with short forelimbs. Even for an ankylosaurid however, Saichania is exceptionally robust, its rump strengthened by ossifications and fusions of the vertebral column, ribs, shoulder girdle and breast bones. Arbour in 2014 established a revised list of distinguishing traits. The osteoderms on the skull are bulbous. The first and second neck vertebrae are fused into a single element, a syncervical. The upper side of the humerus is very broad, equalling 70% of the total length of the bone. The rib shafts are expanded by intercostal ossifications, the cartilage connecting the ribs having been turned into bone sheets. The cervical halfrings, protecting the neck, have each an underlying continuous band of bone and the borders between the segments of these rings are covered by extra armour plates entirely hiding these connections from view. Left side view of a cast of PIN 3142/250 The skull of Saichania is broad, 455 millimetres long and 480 millimetres wide with the holotype. The top of the snout is covered with strongly convex osteoderms. These armour tiles on the snout comprise a central large caputegula. A large \\"loreal\\" osteoderm covers much of the top edge and the side of the snout. The caputegula on the prefrontal is of moderate size and not strongly protruding sideways. The osteoderms on the upper eye socket rim are continuous, not forming two peaks. An extra osteoderm on the rear supraorbital, as in Tarchia, is lacking. The pyramid-shaped squamosal horns on the rear skull corners are broad, not narrow as with Tarchia. These horns have a uniform surface texture, not a division into a smooth and rough surface as in Zaraapelta. On the cheek, large triangular quadratojugal horns are present. Skeleton Saichania skull cast mounted on the skeleton of cf. Pinacosaurus in Mongolia The skull had very complex air passages. The main entrance of each external nostril consisted of a roomy \\"nasal vestibule\\". In each vestibule again two smaller entrances were present, vertically arranged. The lower hole allowed air to enter the hollow inside of the bone core of the beak. This premaxillary sinus had a little recess at the top, connected by a nerve channel to the mouth. Marya≈Ñska presumed this recess housed a Jacobson's organ, a secondary smelling organ. The main room of the premaxillary sinus was connected to behind with a sinus in the maxilla, which itself was partly divided in two by a transverse bone wall or septum. The nasal cavity was large, situated directly below the snout roof. It was divided into a left and right side by a thick vertical bone wall. It was also horizontally divided in two by high internal wings of the praemaxillae and the upper side of a crista maxilloturbinalis. This latter was a scroll-like structure, a turbinate bone serving with warm-blooded animals to condense and preserve exhaled moisture. Normally, in dinosaurs these turbinates are not ossified. Together with a crista nasoturbinalis, the crista maxilloturbinalis filled the lower half of the nasal cavity. Marya≈Ñska presumed it was connected with the underlying premaxillary sinus, allowing the animal to exhale air through the lower hole of the nasal vestibule. The upper half of the nasal cavity was the main respiratory tract, allowing air to enter via the upper hole of the nasal vestibule. An unusually strongly ossified hard palate was present. The air passages may have allowed the animal to cool the air that it breathed and limit water loss. The hard palate allowed it to eat tough plants. All this suggested that it lived in a hot, arid, environment. There is even some evidence that the animal may have possessed a salt gland next to its nostrils, which would have further aided it in a desert habitat. The teeth were small and leaf-shaped. There are twenty-two of them in each maxilla, seventeen in the right and sixteen in the left lower jaw of the holotype. On the rear skull, the oval occipital condyle is obliquely pointing to below, indicating that the entire head was appending. A large hyoid bone apparatus was found, in 1977 the most complete discovered for any dinosaur. It is V-shaped with the central parts representing the basihyal and basibranchial, and the branches being the ceratobranchialia. This bone apparently supported a long tongue. The front skeleton shows some exceptional ossifications and fusions. The front neck vertebrae, the atlas and axis, are grown together. The cervical vertebrae have very long joint processes, zygapophyses, showing that thick intervertebral discs must have been present and that the neck was longer and more flexible than is often assumed. The short rib and the diapophysis of the first dorsal vertebra are fused with the coracoid, immobilising the entire shoulder girdle relative to the vertebral column. The coracoids are small but sharply curving to the inside below, almost meeting each other. From the fifth rib onwards, the rib shafts have intercostal plates on their rear edges, ossified cartilage sheets, overlapping the front edge of the next rib. The intercostal plate is positioned in a relatively high position in the fifth rib; more to the rear of the series it gradually descends towards the lower belly. These ribs also articulate at their lower ends with the breast bones, a condition which is rare in the Ornithischia. The breast bones are fully ossified and connect to form a sternal plate that is split in front and broadly forked at the rear. The humerus is very robust. Thirty centimetres long in the holotype, it has an upper side width of 212 millimetres due to a well-developed inner corner and a strong hatchet-shaped deltopectoral crest. The ulna, twenty-one centimetres in length, also is robust but has a relatively low olecranon. The metacarpus is short, in 1977 it was the shortest of any Asian ankylosaur known. The metacarpals were positioned vertically, closely connected into an arch. Below the first and second metacarpal small disc-shaped sesamoid bones were found. Body armour The holotype preserves the front body armour in articulation. The neck is protected by two cervical halfrings, each made of six rectangular segments positioned next to each other: two at the top, two at the upper sides and two at the lower sides. Each segment has a keel parallel to the long axis of the body. The keel of the lower side segments is the largest. The segments are connected to an underlying continuous band of bone, mainly by a broad fusion at the front edge, but also by a narrow strip at the rear. The seams between the segments are covered by a rectangular zone of small oval osteoderms. Between the upper and lower side segment a larger central osteoderm is present, forming a rosette. The front halfring is smaller than the rear one. A central row of symmetrical conical osteoderms is positioned on the back. On both sides of this median series, a parallel row of large thin osteoderms is present, featuring moderately high keels, their apexes pointing to behind. The vertical sides of the rump are covered by three rows of conical osteoderms: the upper rim is equipped with large plates and apexes pointing to the rear; at the middle side a similar row is present of even larger plates; the lower edge has a row of smaller plates, their keels to the contrary directed to the front. In general, the keels are sharp and narrower plates have higher and more asymmetrically placed keels. Some osteoderms have the shape of pure cones. The larger osteoderms are also ordered in transverse rows but are not fused into bands; small ossicles connect the larger elements. On the underside of the breast, osteoderms are present also. Classification Marya≈Ñska classified Saichania as a member of the Ankylosauridae, related to Pinacosaurus and observed that these two dinosaurs differ from all others in the structure of their nasal cavities. Marya≈Ñska provided a differential diagnosis that showed that the two genera were distinct based on morphological differences observed in the bones of the skull and braincase. Later cladistic analyses recovered a position in the Ankylosaurinae, often close to Tarchia, which is not surprising given that the Operational Taxonomic Unit of the latter was typically based on specimen PIN 3142/250, now referred to Saichania. However, even if the Tarchia OTU is based on its holotype only, it is still closely related to Saichania. Front view of PIN 3142/250, which has been referred to both Saichania and Tarchia The following cladogram is based on a 2015 phylogenetic analysis of the Ankylosaurinae conducted by Arbour and Currie: Paleobiology Saichania lived in a desert habitat, with sand dunes interspersed with oases. Other dinosaurs present in the Barun goyot included Lamaceratops, Bagaceratops and Tylocephale; large theropods have not been found yet. In the later Nemegt the gigantic predator Tarbosaurus was present. A study by William Gallagher in 1998 showed by means of a CAT-scan that specimen PIN 3142/250 had a healed puncture hole of a tyrannosauroid tooth above the right eye socket.Gallagher W.B., Tumanova T.A., Dodson P., Axel L., 1998, \\"CT scanning Asian ankylosaurs: paleopathology in a Tarchia skull\\", Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 18: 44A-45A Arbour pointed out that Saichania, Tarchia and Zaraapelta shared the same habitat. She assumed that this relative ankylosaurian abundance in species had been caused by them being the main herbivores in the area, enough crop thus being available to feed three populations, although their relative niches were unclear. The differences in head ornamentation would then have served species recognition. She saw no indications of sexual dimorphism.

Description Growing as large as long (including forceps), the Saint Helena earwig was the world's largest earwig. It was shiny black with reddish legs, short elytra and no hind wings. Distribution and ecology The earwig was endemic to Saint Helena, being found on the Horse Point Plain, Prosperous Bay Plain, and the Eastern Arid Area of the island. It was known to have lived in plain areas, gumwood forests and seabird colonies in rocky places. The earwig inhabited deep burrows, coming out only at night following rain. Dave Clark of the London Zoo said that \\"the females make extremely good mothers\\". History The Saint Helena earwig was first discovered by Danish entomologist Johan Christian Fabricius, who named it Labidura herculeana in 1798. It later became confused with the smaller and more familiar shore earwig Labidura riparia, was demoted to a subspecies of that species in 1904 and received little attention from science. It was all but forgotten until it was rediscovered in 1962 when two ornithologists, Douglas Dorward and Philip Ashmole, found some enormous dry tail pincers while searching for bird bones. They were given to zoologist Arthur Loveridge who confirmed they belonged to a huge earwig. The remains were forwarded to F. E. Zeuner, who named it as a new species Labidura loveridgei.Zeuner, F. E. (1962). A subfossil giant Dermapteron from St. Helena. Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, 138: 651-653. In 1965, entomologists found live specimens in burrows under boulders in Horse Point Plain. While they were thought to be a separate species L. loveridgei, once examined they were found to be the same as L. herculeana, and this was reinstated as their official scientific name (L. loveridgei became a junior synonym). Other searches since the 1960s have not succeeded in finding the earwig. It was allegedly last seen alive in 1967. On 4 January 1982, the Saint Helena Philatelic Bureau issued a commemorative stamp depicting the earwig, which brought attention to its conservation. In the spring of 1988, a two-man search called Project Hercules was launched by London Zoo, but was unsuccessful. In April 1995 another specimen of earwig remains was found. It proved that the earwigs not only lived in gumwood forests but, before breeding seabirds were wiped out by introduced predators, they also lived in seabird colonies. In 2005 Howard Mendel from the Natural History Museum conducted a search, with Philip and Myrtle Ashmole, to no avail. Conservation status The earwig has not been seen alive since 1967 despite searches for it in 1988, 1993, 2003 and 2005. It is possibly extinct due to habitat loss, \\"by the removal of nearly all surface stones.. ... for construction\\", as well as predation by introduced rodents, mantids, and centipedes (Scolopendra morsitans). In 2014, the IUCN changed their assessment of L. herculeana on the IUCN Red List from Critically Endangered to Extinct.

Barcelona, Spain p. 261 Discovery and naming In 1931 and 1932, John Willis Stovall uncovered remains of a large theropod near Kenton in Cimarron County, Oklahoma in layers of the late Kimmeridgian. In 1941, these were named Saurophagus maximus by Stovall in an article by journalist Grace Ernestine Ray.Ray, G.E., 1941, \\"Big for his day\\", Natural History 48: 36-39 The generic name is derived from Greek œÉŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ, ', \\"lizard\\", œÜŒ¨Œ≥ŒµŒπŒΩ, ', \\"to eat\\", with the compound meaning of \\"lizard eater\\". The specific epithet maximus means \\"the largest\\" in Latin. Because the naming article did not contain a description, the name remained a nomen nudum. In 1987, Spencer George Lucas erroneously made OMNH 4666, a tibia, the lectotype, unaware that Saurophagus was a nomen nudum.Lucas, S.G., Mateer, N.J., Hunt, A.P., and O'Neill, F.M., 1987, \\"Dinosaurs, the age of the Fruitland and Kirtland Formations, and the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico\\", p. 35-50. In: Fassett, J.E. and Rigby, J.K., Jr. (eds.), The Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary in the San Juan and Raton Basins, New Mexico and Colorado. GSA Special Paper 209 Later, it was discovered that the name Saurophagus was preoccupied: in 1831, it had already been given by William Swainson to a tyrant-flycatcher, an extant eater of taxonomically true lizards.W.

Part 2, Birds, London, J. Murray In 1995, Daniel Chure named a new genus: Saurophaganax, adding Greek suffix -Œ¨ŒΩŒ±Œæ, ', meaning \\"ruler\\", to the earlier name. Chure also found OMNH 4666 undiagnostic in relation to Allosaurus, so he chose OMNH 01123, a neural arch, as the holotype for Saurophaganax.Chure, D., 2000, A new species of Allosaurus from the Morrison Formation of Dinosaur National Monument (Utah-Colorado) and a revision of the theropod family Allosauridae. Ph.D. dissertation, Columbia University, pp. 1-964 ‚Äî and Saurophaganax is not a renaming of \\"Saurophagus\\". Much of the material informally named \\"Saurophagus maximus\\", namely those diagnostic elements that could be distinguished from Allosaurus, were referred to Saurophaganax maximus by Chure. They contain disarticulated bones of at least four individuals. Saurophaganax is the official state fossil of Oklahoma, and a large skeleton of Saurophaganax can be seen in the Jurassic hall in the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History. Although the best known Saurophaganax material was found in the panhandle of Oklahoma, possible Saurophaganax material, NMMNH P-26083, a partial skeleton including a femur, several tail vertebrae, and a hip bone, has been found in northern New Mexico. Relationship with Allosaurus  Size comparison The identification of Saurophaganax is a matter of dispute. It has been described as its own genus, or as a species of Allosaurus: Allosaurus maximus. The most recent review of basal tetanurans accepted Saurophaganax as a distinct genus. New possible Saurophaganax material from New Mexico may clear up the status of the genus. Paleoecology Mounted skeleton posed attacking a Diplodocus, New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science Saurophaganax was one of the largest carnivores of Late Jurassic North America. Chure even gave an estimate of , though other estimations have been lower. The fossils known of Saurophaganax (both the possible New Mexican material and the Oklahoma material) are known from the Brushy Basin Member, which is the latest part of the Morrison Formation, suggesting that this genus was either always uncommon or that it first appeared rather late in the Jurassic. Saurophaganax was large for an allosaurid, and bigger than both its contemporaries Torvosaurus tanneri and Allosaurus fragilis. Being much rarer than its contemporaries, making up one percent or less of the Morrison theropod fauna, not much about its behavior is known. The Morrison Formation is a sequence of shallow marine and alluvial sediments which, according to radiometric dating, ranges between 156.3 million years old (Ma) at its base, to 146.8 million years old at the top, which places it in the late Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian, and early Tithonian stages of the Late Jurassic period. This formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons. The Morrison Basin where dinosaurs lived, stretched from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan, and was formed when the precursors to the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. The deposits from their east-facing drainage basins were carried by streams and rivers and deposited in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels and floodplains. This formation is similar in age to the Solnhofen Limestone Formation in Germany and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania. In 1877, this formation became the center of the Bone Wars, a fossil-collecting rivalry between early paleontologists Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope. The Morrison Formation records an environment and time dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs such as Barosaurus, Apatosaurus, Brontosaurus, Camarasaurus, Diplodocus, and Brachiosaurus. Dinosaurs that lived alongside Saurophaganax, and may have served as prey, included the herbivorous ornithischians Camptosaurus, Dryosaurus, Stegosaurus, and Othnielosaurus. Predators in this paleoenvironment included the theropods Torvosaurus, Ceratosaurus, Marshosaurus, Stokesosaurus, Ornitholestes, andFoster, J. (2007). \\"Appendix.\\" Jurassic West: The Dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation and Their World. Indiana University Press. pp. 327-329. Allosaurus, which accounted for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens and was at the top trophic level of the Morrison food web. Other vertebrates that shared this paleoenvironment included ray-finned fishes, frogs such as Eobatrachus, salamanders, turtles, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans like Goniopholis, and several species of pterosaur like Kepodactylus. Early mammals were present in this region, such as Fruitafossor, docodonts, multituberculates, symmetrodonts, and triconodonts. The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of tree ferns, and ferns (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the Araucaria-like conifer Brachyphyllum. In Oklahoma, Stovall unearthed a considerable number of Apatosaurus specimens, which may have represented possible prey for a large theropod like Saurophaganax.

An elective course for students took shape during his administration and the endowment surpassed the million-dollar mark. Bartlett improved working conditions for faculty members and added 30 more scholarships to what had been an already growing list during the tenure of President Lord. But the administration of President Bartlett was an embattled one, and he lost the vital support of faculty and alumni alike. The controversy surrounding him reached an apogee when the majority of the graduating Class of 1881 called for his removal from office. Subjected to an investigation by the Trustees, Bartlett employed what had become a legendary wit and finely honed intelligence to explain his actions and defend his administration. As a result, the charges‚Äîthat he had alienated the faculty, ignored important administrative duties and generally conducted himself in a way unbecoming a Dartmouth president--\\"melted away,\\" in the words of one chronicler. President Bartlett remained in office until 1892, when he resigned to become a member of the faculty.

This spring-fed stream is a fishing destination for its native brook trout, and introduced brown trout. The park rests on a heavily forested valley, up to deep in places, amidst the farmland of southeastern Minnesota. Located near the town of Caledonia, the park was developed in the 1930s by the Works Progress Administration. The parkland exhibits the highly stream-carved terrain characteristic of the Driftless Area. Natural history Between 500 and 450 million years ago shallow inland seas covered the region. Sediment built up into a layer called Oneota dolomite followed by a layer called Jordan sandstone, followed by a second layer of dolomite. Today the Jordan sandstone forms the walls of the valley while the upper layer of dolomite caps the ridges. Both types of rock are water-permeable, resulting in numerous springs. The deep valley of East Beaver Creek is indicative of the Driftless Area. Whereas most of the Midwestern United States was blanketed with till, or drift, by three successive ice ages, the Driftless Area remained ice-free. Therefore, streams and rivers have had a longer time to cut into their beds, eroding deep valleys and leaving high ridges. East Beaver Creek, which joins with West Beaver Creek at the north end of the park, is in the drainage system of the Root River. Flash flooding can occur after heavy rainfall. The creek supports wild population of brown trout. Flora and fauna Within the valley the vegetation is bottomland hardwoods such as black ash, willow, box elder, cottonwood, and elm. Higher on the valley walls and on the flat ground beyond the forest is a mix of maple, walnut, basswood, and oak. Some south and west- facing slopes bear remnant prairie patches. Several rare or endangered plants are found in the park. Acadian flycatchers and Louisiana waterthrushes, birds rare in Minnesota, nest within this park. Mammals that roam here are raccoons, deer, badgers, minks, beavers, gray and red foxes, muskrats, and wild turkeys. There are also resident timber rattlesnakes but they are rarely encountered by visitors. When a hiker was bitten in the park in July 2011, it was the first unprovoked attack by a timber rattlesnake in Minnesota since 1996. Cultural history A Native American village was once located in Beaver Creek Valley, as indicated by archaeological field surveys. Some prehistoric stone tools have been found. Europeans began homesteading the area in the 1850s, attracted by rich farming soil, hardwood lumber, and streams conducive to milling. Much of the land around Beaver Creek Valley was too rugged to farm, so most of the parcels were used as pasture or woodlots. In 1876 a gristmill was built on Beaver Creek. Now known as the Schech Mill, it is the last water-powered mill in Minnesota still operating with its original equipment. Beaver Creek Valley was proposed as a state park in the 1930s, and acquisition of the privately owned lots began in 1936. The park was authorized by the Minnesota Legislature the following year. A small Works Progress Administration crew arrived in 1938 and built the entrance road, flood control structures, picnic ground, and trails. The campground was developed in the late 1940s. The boundaries of the park were extended in the late 1960s out of concern that landowners along the blufftops might cut the timber, causing erosion. However few owners were willing to sell these lots, as most of it was good farmland which, moreover, wouldn't be easily accessible to parkgoers on the valley floor. In the face of anti-expansion sentiment, the 1978 state legislature redrew the statutory boundaries of the park to include only state-owned land. A provision remains by which additional land could be acquired from willing sellers without legislative action. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has been interested in adding the Schech Mill to the park, but the family that has owned it since 1887 has preferred to operate the mill privately as a tourist attraction. In the mid-1990s Beaver Creek Valley State Park was caught in a dispute between fishing and birdwatching interests. To improve the habitat for large trout, fisheries staff were setting rocks along the banks of the creek to prevent erosion and create overhangs where the fish could hide. However Louisiana waterthrushes and sometimes cerulean warblers nest at the base of creekside trees, some of which were being removed to make space for the rocks. After a public battle over the state's wildlife management policies, the upper and lower sections of East Beaver Creek were modified and the middle section left alone. Recreation Beaver Creek Valley in late autumn Fishing for brown trout is a popular activity in Beaver Creek Valley State Park. Trophy specimens of or more have been caught. Because the valley is so narrow, the campground sites are staggered on either side of the park road. There are 42 drive-in sites (16 with electrical hookups), 6 walk-in sites, a camper cabin, and at the end of the park road 3 group camp sites. There are of hiking trails.

Als-Nielsen, D. McMorrow, Elements of Modern X-Ray Physics, Wiley, New York, (2001).J. Daillant, A. Gibaud, X-Ray and Neutron Reflectivity: Principles and Applications. Springer, (1999).M. Tolan, X-Ray Scattering from Soft-Matter Thin Films, Springer, (1999). It is a form of reflectometry based on the use of X-rays and is related to the techniques of neutron reflectometry and ellipsometry. Diagram of x-ray specular reflection The basic principle of X-ray reflectivity is to reflect a beam of X-rays from a flat surface and to then measure the intensity of X-rays reflected in the specular direction (reflected angle equal to incident angle). If the interface is not perfectly sharp and smooth then the reflected intensity will deviate from that predicted by the law of Fresnel reflectivity. The deviations can then be analyzed to obtain the density profile of the interface normal to the surface. History The technique appears to have first been applied to X-rays by Lyman G. Parratt in 1954. Parratt's initial work explored the surface of copper-coated glass, but since that time the technique has been extended to a wide range of both solid and liquid interfaces. Approximation When an interface is not perfectly sharp, but has an average electron density profile given by \\\\rho_e(z) , then the X-ray reflectivity can be approximated by: : R(Q)/R_F(Q) = \\\\left\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho _\\\\infty} {\\\\int\\\\limits_{ - \\\\infty }^\\\\infty {e^{iQz} \\\\left( \\\\frac{d \\\\rho _e}{dz} \\\\right) dz} } \\\\right^2 Here R(Q) is the reflectivity, Q = 4 \\\\pi \\\\sin ( \\\\theta ) / \\\\lambda , \\\\lambda is the X-ray wavelength (typically copper's K-alpha peak at 0.154056 nm), \\\\rho _\\\\infty is the density deep within the material and \\\\theta is the angle of incidence. Below the critical angle Q < Q_c (derived from Snell's law), 100% of incident radiation is reflected, R=1 . For Q \\\\gg Q_c , R \\\\sim Q^{-4} . Typically one can then use this formula to compare parameterized models of the average density profile in the z-direction with the measured X-ray reflectivity and then vary the parameters until the theoretical profile matches the measurement. Oscillations For films with multiple layers, X-ray reflectivity may show oscillations with Q (angle/wavelength), analogous to the Fabry-P√©rot effect, here called Kiessig fringes. The period of these oscillations can be used to infer layer thicknesses, interlayer roughnesses, electron densities and their contrasts, and complex refractive indices (which depend on atomic number and atomic form factor), for example using the Abeles matrix formalism or the recursive Parratt-formalism as follows: : X_j = \\\\frac{R_j}{T_j} = \\\\frac{r_{j,j+1} + X_{j+1} e^{2i k_{j+1,z} d_j}}{1 + r_{j,j+1} X_{j+1} e^{2i k_{j+1,z} d_j}} e^{-2i k_{j,z} d_j} where Xj is the ratio of reflected and transmitted amplitudes between layers j and j+1, dj is the thickness of layer j, and rj,j+1 is the Fresnel coefficient for layers j and j+1 : r_{j,j+1} = \\\\frac{k_{j,z} - k_{j+1,z}}{k_{j,z} + k_{j+1,z}} where kj,z is the z component of the wavenumber. For specular reflection where the incident and reflected angles are equal, Q used previously is two times kz because Q = k_{incident} + k_{reflected} . With conditions RN+1 = 0 and T1 = 1 for an N-interface system (i.e. nothing coming back from inside the semi-infinite substrate and unit amplitude incident wave), all Xj can be calculated successively. Roughness can also be accounted for by adding the factor : r_{j,j+1,rough} = r_{j,j+1,ideal} e^{-2 k_{j,z} k_{j+1,z} \\\\sigma_j^2} where \\\\sigma is a standard deviation (aka roughness). Thin film thickness and critical angle can also be approximated with a linear fit of squared incident angle of the peaks \\\\theta^2 in rad2 vs unitless squared peak number N^2 as follows: : \\\\theta^2 = (\\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{2 d})^2 N^2 + \\\\theta_c^2 . Curve fitting X-ray reflectivity measurements are analyzed by fitting to the measured data a simulated curve calculated using the recursive Parratt's formalism combined with the rough interface formula. The fitting parameters are typically layer thicknesses, densities (from which the index of refraction n and eventually the wavevector z component k_{j,z} is calculated) and interfacial roughnesses. Measurements are typically normalized so that the maximum reflectivity is 1, but normalization factor can be included in fitting, as well. Additional fitting parameters may be background radiation level and limited sample size due to which beam footprint at low angles may exceed the sample size, thus reducing reflectivity. Several fitting algorithms have been attempted for X-ray reflectivity, some of which find a local optimum instead of the global optimum. The Levenberg-Marquardt method finds a local optimum. Due to the curve having many interference fringes, it finds incorrect layer thicknesses unless the initial guess is extraordinarily good. The derivative-free simplex method also finds a local optimum. In order to find global optimum, global optimization algorithms such as simulated annealing are required. Unfortunately, simulated annealing may be hard to parallelize on modern multicore computers. Given enough time, simulated annealing can be shown to find the global optimum with a probability approaching 1, but such convergence proof does not mean the required time is reasonably low. In 1998, it was found that genetic algorithms are robust and fast fitting methods for X-ray reflectivity. Thus, genetic algorithms have been adopted by the software of practically all X-ray diffractometer manufacturers and also by open source fitting software. Fitting a curve requires a function usually called fitness function, cost function, fitting error function or figure of merit (FOM). It measures the difference between measured curve and simulated curve, and therefore, lower values are better. When fitting, the measurement and the best simulation are typically represented in logarithmic space. From mathematical standpoint, the \\\\chi^2 fitting error function takes into account the effects of Poisson-distributed photon counting noise in a mathematically correct way: : F = \\\\sum_i \\\\frac{(x_{simul,i} - x_{meas,i})^2}{x_{meas,i}} . However, this \\\\chi^2 function may give too much weight to the high-intensity regions. If high-intensity regions are important (such as when finding mass density from critical angle), this may not be a problem, but the fit may not visually agree with the measurement at low-intensity high-angle ranges. Another popular fitting error function is the 2-norm in logarithmic space function. It is defined in the following way: : F = \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_i (\\\\log x_{simul,i} - \\\\log x_{meas,i})^2} . Needless to say, in the equation data points with zero measured photon counts need to be removed. This 2-norm in logarithmic space can be generalized to p-norm in logarithmic space. The drawback of this 2-norm in logarithmic space is that it may give too much weight to regions where relative photon counting noise is high. Open source software Diffractometer manufacturers typically provide commercial software to be used for X-ray reflectivity measurements. However, several open source software packages are also available: GenX is a commonly used open source X-ray reflectivity curve fitting software. It is implemented in the Python programming language and runs therefore on both Windows and Linux. Motofit runs in the IGOR Pro environment, and thus cannot be used in open-source operating systems such as Linux. Micronova XRR runs under Java and is therefore available on any operating system on which Java is available. Reflex is a standalone software dedicated to the simulation and analysis of X-rays and neutron reflectiity from multilayers. REFLEX is a user-friendly freeware program working under Windows and Linux platforms.

Jos√© Maur√≠cio Nunes Garcia (September 22, 1767 ‚Äì April 18, 1830) was a Brazilian classical composer, one of the greatest exponents of Classicism in the Americas. Born in Rio de Janeiro, son of mulattos, Nunes Garcia lost his father at an early age. His mother perceived that her son had an inclination for becoming a musician and, for this reason, improved her work to allow him to continue his musical studies. Nunes Garcia became a priest and, when prince John VI of Portugal came to Rio de Janeiro with his 15,000 people, Nunes Garcia was appointed Master of the Royal Chapel. He sang and played the harpsichord, performing his compositions as well as those of other composers such as Domenico Cimarosa and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. He was a very prestigious musician in the royal court of John VI. His musical style was strongly influenced by Viennese composers of the period, such as Mozart and Haydn. Today, some 240 musical pieces written by Nunes Garcia survive, and at least 170 others are known to have been lost . Most of his compositions are sacred works, but he wrote also some secular pieces, including the opera Le due gemelle and the Tempest Symphony. Infancy and youth On September 22, 1767, in a humble house at Rua da Vala, in Rio de Janeiro, a boy was born to a couple of free mulattos, Vit√≥ria Maria da Cruz and the tailor Apolin√°rio Nunes Garcia. Vit√≥ria was born in the city of Mariana, in the province of Minas Gerais, and Apolin√°rio, in Ilha do Governador (Governor's Island), near the city of Rio de Janeiro. Victoria's mother was Joana Gon√ßalves, slave of Sim√£o Gon√ßalves, and Apolin√°rio was the son of Ana Correa do Desterro, slave of the parrish Apolin√°rio Nunes Garcia. Their baptism documents have no record of their fathers' names, an evidence they were both their lord's children. Victoria and Apolin√°rio married in 1762. The boy, who had been born on St Maurice's day, was baptized Jos√© Mauricio Nunes Garcia, on December 20 of this same year, in the city's See, now the church of Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio. An aunt, whose name is not known, lived with the family. After Apolin√°rio's death in 1773, they both raised the small boy, and, when his precocious musical talent was detected, they succeeded to contract, not without sacrifice, Salvador Jos√© de Almeida e Faria to teach him music. Faria had been educated in the musical style of the province of Minas Gerais in the 18th century, and there he made his career; this explains why this style is present in Nunes Garcia's early compositions. To complete his musical education, he probably joined the See's boys choir, as a soprano. The choir's components were students of the Semin√°rio de S√£o Joaquim, today Pedro II school, where they learned to read music, Greek and Latin. According to Manuel de Ara√∫jo Porto Alegre, one of his early biographers, the young boy had \\"a beautiful voice and a sharp musical memory\\"; \\"reproduced everything he heard\\", and \\"created his own melodies and played the harpsichord and the guitar without ever have learned to\\". In 1779, at twelve, Nunes Garcia began to teach music. Since he never had a piano or a harpsichord, he exercised on the keyboard by teaching the society's ladies in their homes. He learned to play the organ later, when he was already a priest, assisted by some good organists in the churches. He completed his education in the \\"Royal Classes\\", public classes with lectures in history, geography, Latin grammar, philosophy and rhetoric. The first steps for priesthood Note: the abbreviation CPM refers to the Thematic Catalogue of Nunes Garcia's Works, compiled by the musicologist Mrs. Cleofe Person de Mattos. In 1783, at 16, Nunes Garcia composed his first surviving work: the antiphon Tota pulchra Es Maria (CPM 1). In the 1780s, he studied for the examinations he had to go through to take the holy orders, and developed a musical partnership with the old chapel master and subchanter of the See, deacon Jo√£o Lopes Ferreira. These would be his first steps to succeed him as the chapel master. In 1784, the brotherhood of Saint Cecilia, the traditional guild of the musicians, was founded in Rio de Janeiro. Nunes Garcia, at 17, was allowed to sign the foundation act, as he was already recognized as a professional music teacher. By the end of the 1780s, he had already a large repertoire of his own: a Litany for Our Lady for 4 voices and organ, in 1788; the anthems O Redemptor Summe Carmen and Pange Lingua, both in 1789; and the works a capella for all the Holy Week of the See, the Bradados or Passions, of these the most important was Bradados de 6¬™ feira maior (CPM 219), or Passion for Good Friday; this work originally included some motets classified ‚Äì and nowadays sung ‚Äì apart: Crux Fidelis (CPM 205), Heu Domine (CPM 211), Popule Meus (CPM 222), Sepulto Domino (CPM 223), and Vexilla Regis (CPM 225). In 1790 Nunes Garcia composed an instrumental work that made him famous in Rio de Janeiro: the Funeral Symphony (CPM 230). He requested the holy orders in 1791. The two main prerequisites to be accepted were to prove the true Catholic faith from himself and from his parents, and to be free from \\"any color defect\\". The first had been proved through research and witnessing from his parents' and grandmothers' friends. To overcome the second, he requested to be dismissed from his \\"defect\\", in which he was successful. In June 1791, he began the necessary examinations, and in March 1792 he was approved. There was one last requirement to take orders: to be an estate owner. This was gone through with the help of one of his student's father, Thomaz Gon√ßalves, a rich merchant who donated him a house at Rua das Bellas Noutes. Nunes Garcia tried to develop himself in oratory, as it was useful to a priest, taking part in meetings of the Literary Society, founded in 1794. In 1797, the society was closed and their leaders arrested, under the accusation of revolutionary activities against the Crown. Among the arrested was Manuel In√°cio da Silva Alvarenga, a poet born in the city of Vila Rica, and relative of In√°cio Jos√© de Alvarenga Peixoto, one of the condemned leaders of the Inconfid√™ncia Mineira, a 1789 uprising in the province of Minas Gerais. In 1795, he was appointed as public music instructor, installing a free music class in his own house. There the only instrument left for teaching was a steel guitar, used in sequence by all the students. Great musicians and singers there began their musical education. They would enrich Rio's musical stage during almost all the 19th century. Chapel master Following his ordination, Nunes Garcia enjoyed a period of great productivity. From this period are known 32 pieces of music, among them graduals, antiphons, various psalms, a Magnificat (CPM 16) for voices and organ, the vespers V√©speras das Dores de N. Sr¬™. (CPM 177), V√©speras de N. Sr¬™. (CPM 178), and several works for Holy Week: two Miserere, one for Maundy Thursday (CPM 194), and the other for Good Friday (CPM 195), and, in 1797, his first mass, Missa para os pontificiais da S√© ‚Äì Pontifical mass of the See. On July 4 (or 5th), 1798, deacon Lopes Ferreira died. Two days earlier, perhaps because of his imminent death, Nunes Garcia was nominated chapel master. His dream of succeeding the master had come true. The position of subchanter was occupied by deacon Jos√© Mariano. In 1799 he joined the brotherhood of Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio e S√£o Benedito dos Homens Pretos, in whose church the See was installed. This same year he composed a Funeral Office (CPM 183) and a Requiem Mass (CPM 184), in honour of the deceased deacons, probably a personal tribute to Lopes Ferreira, and the Matins of Christmas (CPM 170). As his house at Rua das Bellas Noutes was near the city's Public Garden, there is evidence that he took part in the traditional serenades there, for, in 1837, the scores of three of his popular compositions were printed by music editor Pierre Laforge; the Modinhas: Beijo a m√£o que me condena (CPM 226) ‚Äì I kiss the hand that signs my condemnation; Mar√≠lia, se n√£o me amas (CPM 238) ‚Äì Mar√≠lia, if you don't love me, and No momento da partida, meu cora√ß√£o t'entreguei (CPM 239), ‚Äì at the moment of the departure I gave you my heart. At the beginning of the 19th century, he diversified his production with two overtures: The Tempest (CPM 233) and Zemira (CPM 231), both written in 1803. Few of his other works composed between 1800 and 1807 are known: two graduals, the motet Te Christe Solum Novimus (CPM 52), written in 1800, the Te Deum for the Matins of the Assumption (CPM 91) the Mass in B Flat (CPM 102), both written in 1801, and the antiphon In Honorem Beatissimae Maria Virginis (CPM 4), written in 1807. He resumed his rhetoric classes with Silva Alvarenga from 1802 to 1804, but of his purely rhetorical works, only the titles of two of his sermons are known. Despite celibacy, Nunes Garcia had in the first decade of the 19th century a marital relationship with Severiana Rosa de Castro, born in 1789, she herself a free half-breed. From this relationship five children were born: Jos√© Apolin√°rio, in 1807; Apolin√°rio Jos√©, in 1808; Josefina in 1810, Panf√≠lia in 1811 and Ant√¥nio Jos√© in 1813. The elder, Jos√© Apolin√°rio, later changed his own name to Jos√© Maur√≠cio Nunes Garcia Jr, after his father's acknowledgement, in 1828. The Portuguese Royal Family arrives in Rio de Janeiro The Palace Square of Rio de Janeiro, 1808. Watercolor by Richard Bates. In January, 1808 the brig Voador brought to Rio the news of the imminent arrival of the Portuguese Royal Family. They were fleeing from the invasion of their kingdom by the French troops, led by general Junot. Some weeks later, another boat brought the information of the precise date of the arrival: March 7, and a request from prince regent John: to assist at a Te Deum, celebrated in the city's See, in thanksgiving for the successful trip. Some steps were taken in advance for the occasion, and at the informed date, the Anglo-Portuguese fleet reached the bay of Rio de Janeiro. The prince regent and his court disembarked the next day, walking from the port to the See. Along the way, there were fireworks, music and the churches' bells tolling. When the prince entered the church, a \\"great orchestra\\", joined by the boys' choir, began to play. The music was conducted by Nunes Garcia. About it, besides probably his Te Deum in D (CPM 96) written in 1799, there were presented the antiphons O Beatae Sebastiane, and Sub Tuum Praesidium (CPM 2). The prince regent, though enthusiastic about the music, did not have the same opinion about the players. Soon he became aware of the precarious state of the See, and the quarrels between the Chapter and the church's brotherhood. One of his first decrees in Rio was to transfer the Chapter to the church of the Firsts of the Carmel, next to the Governor's Palace. Soon he had the idea to create a Royal Chapel, to replace his Patriarchal of Lisbon, to be installed in this church. The institution was made official when the Portuguese bishop Dom Jos√© Caetano da Silva Coutinho arrived in the city, on April 25, 1808. He had to act with diplomacy to integrate the priests of the Patriarchal of Lisbon with the Chapter of the See of Rio de Janeiro. The admission of the Brazilian priests had been officialized, but the Portuguese clergy thought otherwise: in an anonymous document, they stated that, as a measure of economy, the ministers should be limited to those who previously served the prince regent. This would spare him to see in his chapel someone with a \\"visible physical defect\\". That someone with a \\"visible physical defect\\" was Nunes Garcia. That was only the beginning of a series of aggressive actions, that had the objective of humiliating the man they considered to be of an inferior race. But the prince regent, recognizing his musical gifts, confirmed him, on November 26, as the master musician of the Royal Chapel. That made Nunes Garcia officially the first musician of the kingdom of Portugal. Master of Music of the Royal Chapel The move of the court to Rio de Janeiro was traumatic to the city's 60,000 natives. At once there were 15,000 new inhabitants, needing housing and food. The court servants were first lodged at the ucharia ‚Äì the city's food warehouse at the Carmelite Monastery. The aristocrats needed houses for themselves and for their families, and since there were no homes left, they resorted to requesting them by force. Once chosen, the house was marked with the initials P.R. (Prince Regent), and their owners had to leave it in 24 hours. To avoid problems with food supply due to the sudden increase in the city's population, the prince regent decreed that improvements would be made at the Royal Farm of Santa Cruz, a former Jesuit settlement distant seven leagues (30 miles) from the city. Tre property had been transferred to the Crown in 1769, when the Jesuits were expelled from Portugal and all the colonies. The goods there produced were transported to Rio and sold at the ucharia. The farm would be soon transformed in a summer palace for the royal family. Since, when it was owned by the Jesuites, it had a choir of slaves, and as they would be useful at the masses, the prince regent commissioned two music teachers to live and work there to improve their music skills. The musical ensemble of the See did not please the prince. To improve their quality, the musicians of the Patriarchal of Lisbon, most of them still living in that city, were called to Rio. The task of composing new works was left to Nunes Garcia. From 1808 to 1811, he composed about 70 works for the royal solemnities. The main compositions of 1808 were the Mass of S√£o Pedro de Alc√¢ntara (CPM 104), offered to prince Dom Pedro, the Missa Pastoril (CPM 108) ‚Äì Pastoral Mass, the Missa em F√° (CPM 103) ‚Äì Mass in F, an orchestrated Qui Sedes (CPM 162) and some works which are now lost: a Christmas Mass, and a Mass for the queen Saint Elizabeth, both for voices and organ. The musicians of Lisbon were artists of great technique and virtuosity, and they made Rio de Janeiro an important musical center at that time. The quality of the performers was reflected in the works of the chapel master. But as they were acquainted with a different musical style, and were not satisfied that they were being conducted by a musician who they considered was of an inferior race, they acted as a pressure group against him. The musicians of the old See also joined the new orchestra. In 1809, even with an incomplete music staff, various ceremonies were celebrated with music. This year a holiday in thanksgiving for the royal family's successful trip to Rio was decreed, and a Mass and a Te Deum were composed by Nunes Garcia, for this first year. The other 1809 compositions were: a Mass of St. Michael the Archangel, the Mass for St. Peter of Alcantara (CPM 105), the Mass for the Feast of the Visitation of Our Lady and the one For the Kingdom's Guardian Angel. Holy Week was celebrated solemnly in the Royal Chapel. Among the compositions heard was a Creed for 8 voices, for Maundy Thursday, a Motet of Our Lady, both lost. The surviving works were: Judas Mercator Pessimus (CPM 195), the Matins for the Resurrection (CPM 200), ‚Äì and the sequentia Lauda Sion (CPM 165), for the feast of Corpus Christi. In this same year he composed the music for two allegoric stage plays, written by Gast√£o Fausto da C√¢mara Coutinho: Ulissea, Drama Eroico (CPM 229) and O Triunfo da Am√©rica (CPM 228) ‚Äì The Triumph of America. In February 1809, the prince regent, impressed by the improvisations played by Nunes Garcia at the pianoforte in his palace, retrieved a medal from the coat of the baron of Vila Nova and attached it to his garments, making him a knight of the Order of Christ. Still in this year, he was named archivist of the royal music files, just brought from the Queluz Palace in Lisbon to Rio. This job put him in contact with a more up-to-date repertory, and by studying the scores, he incorporated new techniques to his compositional skills. His salary, although sufficient for him alone, was not enough to face his children's needs for food, education and care. Soon he, in severe debt, decided to mortgage his house. Despite his personal problems, he proceeded with his work. His compositions of 1810 are the Matinas de S. Jo√£o, ‚Äì Matins of St. John, the Mass and the Te Deum in thanksgiving for the successful trip of the royal family, the antiphon Ecce Sacerdos (CPM 5), and the Magnificat for the Vespers of St. Joseph (CPM 17). By the end of the year he had finished the motet Praecursor Domini (CPM 55), for the farm of Santa Cruz, and the Missa de N. Sr¬™ da Concei√ß√£o (CPM 106) ‚Äì Mass of the Conception of Our Lady, a turning point in his musical career. This work reflects clearly what he had learned with the royal music files. Marcos Portugal deputizes for Nunes Garcia In 1811, probably due to the excess of work, Nunes Garcia may have felt severely ill; an evidence for this was a request to the prince to \\"say the mass at home\\". The prince regent, also aware of the pressure put upon him by the European musicians, had no option but to demand his former court composer, Marcos Portugal to cross the ocean and substitute for Nunes Garcia. It seems that Portugal did not want to leave his country. But pressed by the prince, he left Lisbon in March 1811. After a month's trip, he was warmly received in Rio de Janeiro. As in Lisbon eleven years before, he was nominated Master of Music of the Royal Chapel and Director of the Royal Theatre of S√£o Jo√£o, then under construction. His first meeting with Nunes Garcia was likely to be cordial. The priest, requested to play a Haydn sonata at the harpsichord, received greetings for his performance, and Portugal declared: \\"Beautiful! You are my brother in Art! Surely you will be for me a friend.\\" There is no evidence that Nunes Garcia was dismissed in the replacement, or suffered financial loss because of it. Instead, the new situation seemed to be advantageous for him. The titles of some of his own compositions from this period show a clear division of work: Portugal became responsible for the music at the main ceremonies of the Royal Chapel, leaving him the ceremonies of the royal Quinta da Boa Vista, and of the royal farm of Santa Cruz, such as it is in the subtitle of the motet Tamquam Aurum (CPM 56). Besides, having six other mouths to feed, he was now able to find the necessary free time to accept commissioned works from other churches, increasing his own income. After 1811, most of his works were no longer written for the Royal Chapel, but for smaller churches in Rio de Janeiro. By this time the mortgage on his house was paid, another evidence of his financial health. Working as a freelance In the year 1813, Nunes Garcia began to compose regularly for the church of the Thirds of Carmel, side by side with the Royal Chapel. Upon request of his friend Baptista Lisboa, he wrote two psalms: Laudate Dominum (CPM 76) and Laudate Pueri Dominum (CPM 77). This same year, for the church of Nossa Senhora da Boa Morte (Our Lady of the Good Death) he orchestrated his Matinas da Assun√ß√£o de Nossa Senhora (CPM 172) ‚Äì Matins of the Assumption of Our Lady, written in 1808, and wrote a Missa Pequena ‚Äì Small Mass, to the feast of Saint Therese. In 1813 the Royal Theatre of S√£o Jo√£o, still unfinished, was opened to the public. In this same year, the French army, led by Napoleon Bonaparte, was defeated in Leipzig, and in 1814 Pope Pius VII returned to Rome from his exile in Avignon. These events were cheerfully celebrated in Rio de Janeiro. Only two of the works written by Nunes Garcia in 1814 are known: the Novena do Ap√≥stolo S√£o Pedro (CPM 66) ‚Äì Novena of the Apostle St. Peter, and the Bendito e Louvado Seja o Sant√≠ssimo Sacramento (CPM 12) ‚Äì Blessed and Praised let it be the Holiest of Sacraments. On November 22 he was awarded from the Prince Regent's Privy Purse an annual amount of 25$000 (twenty five thousand r√©is), to build his \\"clerical assets\\". In 1815 he composed the Matinas do Ap√≥stolo S√£o Pedro (CPM 173) ‚Äì Matins of the Apostle St. Peter, for the brotherhood of S√£o Pedro dos Cl√©rigos. In December 1815, in order to grant for Portugal a seat at the Holy Alliance's assembly, Brazil was promoted from a Portuguese colony to a united kingdom with Portugal and Algarves. In theory, this would make all Brazilians equal in rights to the Portuguese, but in practice, everything was kept as it was. In the beginning of 1816, Nunes Garcia was chosen to conduct the mass in thanksgiving for the event, just because he was a Brazilian native. The mass was celebrated in the church of St. Francis of Paula, at the Largo da S√© Velha, now Largo de S√£o Francisco. It is not known what music was performed during the ceremony. This year Nunes Garcia composed the Moteto para a Ordena√ß√£o do Ilustre Bispo da Real Capela ‚Äì Motet for the Ordination of the Illustrious Bishop of the Royal Chapel; the ceremony occurred only on March 15, 1816. Coincidentally, on March 20, 1816, came the deaths of the Portuguese Queen, Maria I, and of Vit√≥ria Maria da Cruz, Nunes Garcia's mother. The Queen's death was mourned by the whole city. The funeral carriage passed through many streets to the tomb at the Convent of Ajuda, and it was followed by the people in silence. A month later, on April 22, her funeral mass was celebrated solemnly at the Royal Chapel, with a Requiem Mass and a Funeral Office, both composed and conducted by Marcos Portugal. To promote their own funeral ceremony, the Thirds of the Carmel commissioned to Nunes Garcia a whole new Missa de Mortos (CPM 185), a requiem which was clearly influenced by Mozart's famous work, and an Of√≠cio de Defuntos (CPM 186) ‚Äì a Funeral Office, both considered to be his two masterpieces. On July 4, 1816, a third master of music, Fortunato Mazziotti, was admitted at the Royal Chapel. Shortly after, on July 10, he conducted David Perez's Mattutino dei Morti in a second ceremony in memoriam of the Queen. During the United Kingdom The prince regent, in a gesture of reconciliation with France, and concerned about the development of culture and arts in Brazil, sponsored the travel to Rio of a French artistic mission, with specialists in painting, sculpture, architecture, and historiography. The Miss√£o Art√≠stica Francesa arrived in Rio de Janeiro on March 26, 1816. Led by the historiographer Henri Lebreton, the group consisted of Jean-Baptiste Debret (painter), Grandjean de Montigny (architect), Auguste Marie Taunay and Zepherin Ferrez (sculptors), and Nicholas Antoine Taunay (painter and historiographer), among many others. As soon as Taunay heard the music of Nunes Garcia, he passed to call him \\"le grand mul√¢tre\\". Some weeks later, integrating the commitive of the Duke of Luxembourg, the Austrian composer Sigismund Neukomm (Salzburg, 1778; Paris 1858) disembarked in Rio. When in Salzburg, Neukomm had been pupil of Joseph and Michael Haydn. In his whole career, he composed about 1,800 works. Despite his skills, Neukomm was not admitted to the Royal Chapel. Instead, he was appointed Music Teacher to their Royal Highnesses, a position he held until 1821, when he travelled back to Europe. He was severely critical of the operatic style prevalent in sacred music at the time, and of the 45 works he composed in Brazil, only one was performed in the Royal Chapel: the Missa Pro Acclamationis Joannis VI, which he had composed for the acclamation of the prince regent king John VI of Portugal, in 1817. He held Nunes Garcia in high esteem, although most of what he said was reported by Manuel de Ara√∫jo Porto Alegre, who claimed to have met him in Paris in 1853. Neukomm was also responsible for the first presentation in Brazil of Mozart's Requiem (K 626), in the church of the Recolhimento do Parto, with the musicians of the brotherhood of St. Cecilia conducted by Nunes Garcia. In December 1819, Neukomm wrote a Libera Me based in some of its themes, which was presented in sequence, and an article about the performance was published in 1820 in the newspaper Allgemeines Musikalisches Zeitung of Vienna, in which he affirmed it \\"was in nothing behind any european presentation\\". That was his unique first hand opinion about Nunes Garcia. The writings of Porto Alegre which claim that he regarded the Brazilian composer as \\"one of the greatest improvisers of the world\\", or that \\"he admired his self-education in music\\" are suspicious, because he is not even mentioned in Neukomm's autobiography. In 1817, prince Dom Pedro married archduchess Maria Leopoldina Josepha Carolina, daughter of the Emperor of Austria. The archduchess, who had a thorough religious and musical education, brought with her an ensemble of 16 musicians. She arrived in Rio on November 5. The excellence of the musicians made the people gather at Largo de S√£o Jorge, near Nunes Garcia's house, to hear the rehearsals. The priest composed for this ensemble a series of 12 Divertimenti, received with enthusiasm, whose original scores were taken with them and are now lost. Meanwhile, Marcos Portugal had another stroke, which left his right arm paralyzed. Soon later, by request of the prince regent, Nunes Garcia composed the opera Le Due Gemelle, the first work of its kind to be presented in Brazil. The score would later be destroyed in the fire of the Royal Theatre of S√£o Jo√£o in 1825. Only one work of his survives from the year 1817: the Trezena of St. Francis of Paula (CPM 75), composed for the church of this saint. In February 1818, prince regent John was acclaimed king John VI of Portugal, Brazil and Algarves. A new palace had been built specially for the ceremony of acclamation, next to the old one in the Palace Square. The Te Deum had already been composed by Portugal before his stroke. The Mass, as mentioned above, was composed by Neukomm. In the year 1818, Nunes Garcia's production proceeded. He composed, to the Thirds of the Carmel, the Novena (CPM 67) and the Mass for the Feast of Our lady of Carmel (CPM 110), which he conducted with the musicians of the Royal Chapel. He composed also a Qui Sedes and Quoniam (CPM 163), for his pupil C√¢ndido In√°cio da Silva. To the Royal Farm of Santa Cruz, he wrote three motets: Moteto dos Ap√≥stolos, ‚Äì Motet of the Apostles, Moteto das Virgens (CPM 58), ‚Äì Motet for the Virgins, and a Moteto para a Festa de Degola√ß√£o de S. Jo√£o Baptista (CPM 60), ‚Äì Motet for the feast of the beheading of St John the Baptist. And in this year he composed also the Missa Para a Festa da Degola√ß√£o de S. Jo√£o Baptista (CPM 120), ‚Äì Mass for the Feast of the Beheading of St. John the Baptist, which he completed in 20 days at the Royal Farm. In 1819, the first daughter of prince Dom Pedro and the archduchess Leopoldina was born. She was baptized princess Maria da Gl√≥ria, and later she would be Queen Maria II of Portugal. The Senate nominated Nunes Garcia to conduct the thanksgiving mass, celebrated in the church of St. Francis of Paula. From the writings of 1820, there is a small number of Nunes Garcia's surviving works: one Creed in D Major (CPM 127) for voices and organ, the orchestration of the psalm Laudate Pueri Dominum (CPM 77), that he wrote in 1813, and the Missa Mimosa (CPM 111) ‚Äì Gorgeous Mass. Probably at this time he composed the Matinas da Concei√ß√£o de Nossa Senhora (CPM 174) ‚Äì Matins of the Conception of Our Lady. The year 1820 was marked by intense political activity in Portugal, as the people were demanding the immediate return of the royal family, which lead to the Liberal Revolution of 1820. The Portuguese aristocrats in Rio were also showing signs of dissatisfaction, as there were no longer any reasons to stay away from their own country.  Brazilian independence  In April 1821, King John VI decided to return to Portugal. The political situation in his kingdom demanded the immediate return of the royal family, because the throne was at risk of being lost to his dynasty of Braganza. He left his son Pedro as regent of Brazil, to whom he said: \\"Pedro, if Brazil becomes independent, it must be for you, rather than for one of these adventurers, because I know you will respect me\\", and left Rio concerned about the future. Brazil was for him a new kingdom, of his own creation. It was a sad day for Nunes Garcia. Despite the treatment he received from the Portuguese aristocracy, he regarded the King as an appreciator of his music. He received as a reward for his 13-year service to the court a tobacco box decorated with gold and precious gems, with the portrait of the King in ivory. Marcos Portugal stayed, or was left, in Brazil, not because of his own will, but probably because of his poor health, and in order to continue teaching music to the prince regent Pedro. Sigismund Neukomm had departed for France a week before the King's trip to Portugal. Besides his own compositions while he was in Brazil, he made an important contribution to the history of Brazilian music, by putting onto paper some modinhas composed by Joaquim Manoel da C√¢mera, a popular singer and guitar player of that time. According to his witness at Porto Alegre, when he left Rio, Nunes Garcia was preparing a presentation of Haydn's The Creation which did not happen. Instead, he composed two psalms arranged upon themes of this work. In this year 1821, Nunes Garcia also composed a Laudamus that recalls the music of Rossini, whose operas were beginning to make success in the theatres of Rio de Janeiro. The departure of the Portuguese court was a disaster for the country's public finances. The Portuguese aristocracy carried with them all they could, leaving the Bank of Brazil bankrupt. The financial difficulties forced the prince to cut the extra benefits that were conceded to the court musicians, including Nunes Garcia, keeping only their full wages. The priest wrote a letter to the prince, requesting to be restored the extra benefit conceded by King John VI, justifying it as a payment for his public music teaching. Having his request denied, he decided to cease the public music classes he had given for 28 years. The financial disorder set the Brazilians against the Portuguese merchants based in Rio, who were organized in a party to keep their own privileges. The Portuguese aristocracy in Lisbon was also pressing the king to sign an act that would retrieve from Brazil the status of United Kingdom. The prince regent Pedro, facing local upheavals, and in order to avoid the country being split into smaller republics, such as had happened in the Spanish Americas, on his way to the province of S√£o Paulo, decided to declare the Brazilian independence of Portugal on September 7, 1822. On December 1, he was crowned Emperor Pedro I of Brazil. From this crucial year, Nunes Garcia's sole surviving work is the Novena do Sant√≠ssimo Sacramento (CPM 75) ‚Äì Novena of the Holy Sacrament. There are records that the village of Pindamonhangaba commissioned a Te Deum from him, which was presented to the prince regent in the thanksgiving mass for his passage by the village. Portugal declared war on Brazil. The southern provinces were loyal to the Emperor, but Portugal still controlled the north. On March 21, 1823, the young Emperor decided to attack them with the Brazilian fleet commanded by the English admiral Lord Cochrane, who, mostly by bluff, managed to capture the greatest part of the vessels of the Portuguese fleet. There is only one known work by Nunes Garcia dating from 1823: the Missa Abreviada (CPM 113) ‚Äì Abbreviated Mass. In this same year, the Royal Chapel was renamed the 'Imperial Chapel'. Final years In 1825, a fire in the Royal Theatre turned the score of Le Due Gemelle into ashes. In 1826, as comproved by recent researches, King John VI was assassinated with poison. The news of his death caused great sorrow in Rio, especially for Nunes Garcia. This year, two of his pupils, on behalf of the brotherhood of St. Cec√≠lia, commissioned from him a new mass with grand orchestra. The St. Cecilia Mass (CPM 113) was presented in November, and would be his last work. It is a monumental piece of music (some 276 pages long), and the score was later donated by his son Dr. Jos√© Mauricio Nunes Garcia as an admission fee to join the Brazilian Historical and Geographical Institute. From 1826 until his death in 1830, Nunes Garcia dedicated himself to reviewing the orchestration of his greatest mass, and writing a Treatise of Harmony and Counterpoint, now lost. In 1828, he resigned to the title of Knight of the Habit of Christ, on behalf of his \\"nephew\\" Jos√©, the only one he recognized to be his son. In the beginning of 1830, he was living in a small house at Rua do N√∫ncio (nowadays Rep√∫blica do L√≠bano street). In February 1830 Marcos Portugal died, and was buried in the Convent of St. Anthony. Nunes Garcia, perhaps guessing it was his own turn, made his bed to be put in the first floor of his house, so as \\"not to bother anyone\\". On April 18, his son and a slave being present with him, he died, whispering an anthem to Our Lady. The brotherhood of St. Cec√≠lia was responsible for the funeral mass, and he was buried in the church of S√£o Pedro dos Cl√©rigos. At the ceremony, a small orchestra performed his Funeral Symphony (CPM 230), composed 40 years earlier. Posthumous reputation The chapel master was not forgotten by his pupils ‚Äì they continued copying his works. The St. Cecilia Mass (CPM 113) was performed one second time in 1830. In 1831, Emperor Pedro I abdicated from the Brazilian throne on behalf of his son Pedro, then five years old. He embarked to England, to assemble a fleet to fight against his brother Miguel, who threatened to usurp the Portuguese throne of his daughter Maria da Gl√≥ria. A regency government was established in Brazil until the child's adulthood. Among its first acts was one that dissolved the Orchestra of the Imperial Chapel. Some of the dismissed musicians survived as music teachers, some as music copyists. But poverty was the fate for most of them. In 1840 prince Pedro, at 14, was crowned Emperor Pedro II. In 1842 he made the first steps to restore the musical activity at the Imperial Chapel, nominating Francisco Manuel da Silva, a former pupil of Nunes Garcia, as the Chapel Master. The repertory of the late Chapel Master was presented again, but reworked, in order to \\"be his music modernized\\". Da Silva composed the music of the Brazilian national anthem, inspired by a recurrent motif in some of Nunes Garcia's sacred anthems. He also founded the Conservat√≥rio Imperial de M√∫sica, now the School of Music of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. In Campinas, S√£o Paulo, Manuel Jos√© Gomes, the father of composer Carlos Gomes, gathered 14 of Nunes Garcia's compositions in a file. Other important cities where Mauritian works were preserved are in the state of Minas Gerais. In S√£o Jo√£o D'El Rey, The Lira Sanjoanense Musical Society founded in 1776, has many copies, some of them unique, from various works of Nunes Garcia. And some copies of other works belong to Ribeiro Bastos Orchestra, in the same city. In Ouro Preto, the Museu da Inconfid√™ncia is the present owner of the score collection gathered by the German musicologist Francisco Curt Lange, which includes the authograph score of the Abbreviated Mass (CPM 112), written in 1823. But the preservation of the greatest part of Nunes Garcia's remaining works has been done by Bento das Merc√™s, an archivist of the Imperial Chapel. He made precise copies of many of his works, creating a personal file that was later acquired from their heirs by the Brazilian government, and is now in the School of Music of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. There are kept two more collections of scores: the one from the Royal Farm of Santa Cruz, and the other from Francisco Manuel da Silva. The first of the School's directors, Leopoldo Miguez, and composer Alberto Nepomuceno (1864‚Äì1920) studied and edited many of Nunes Garcia's scores. Another of his admirers was Alfred D'Escragnolle, Viscount of Taunay, a grandson of Nicholas Antoine Taunay, member of the French Artistic Mission. Taunay wrote many articles and texts about the composer, and after he was elected to the house of the representatives in 1881, he presented in 1882 an act intended to trace all of Nunes Garcia's works, which was not approved. His son Alfonse gathered his father's texts, which published in 1930 in the book A great glory from Brazil: Jos√© Mauricio Nunes Garcia. After Nepomuceno's death in 1920, live presentations of Nunes Garcia's works became rare. In 1930 his Requiem (CPM 185) was presented at the Candel√°ria Church, conducted by composer Francisco Braga. This same work was performed in 1948, in the funeral mass of composer Lorenzo Fernandez. In 1941, the researcher, musicologist and conductor Mrs. Cleofe Person de Mattos (1913‚Äì2002), professor at the School of Music of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, founded the Coro Pr√≥-Arte, later Association of Choral Singing, a non-profit institution, whose goal was ‚Äì and still is today ‚Äì to perform Brazilian music, especially that of Nunes Garcia. Mattos wrote and had it published by the Federal Council of Culture, in 1970, a Thematic Catalogue of Nunes Garcia's works, where she analyses in detail all of his remaining scores. In the decade of 1980, she helped publish, by Funda√ß√£o Nacional de Arte (FUNARTE), a number of them. And finally in 1997, she published the book Jos√© Mauricio Nunes Garcia ‚Äì Biografia, in which, despite her emotional treatment of the hardships the composer passed through, many events of his life, before obscure, have been made clear. Present research In 2005, the music files of the Metropolitan Chapter of Rio de Janeiro, containing the scores of 55 works of Nunes Garcia and a number of works of other composers, was digitized and is now available on the web. Along with the scores, there were a number of administrative books, chiefly with payrolls and balance sheets of the finances of the Royal Chapel. In two of these payrolls there are records of paybills to Nunes Garcia, up to the annual sum of R$625000 (six hundred twenty-five thousand r√©is) ‚Äì about USD 20,000 in present money ‚Äì that was his income from 1822 to 1830. The reported extreme poverty he faced in his last days is therefore just a hoax. The School of Music of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro also made part of their music files available on the internet.

On 9 June 1995, the de Havilland Canada Dash 8 aircraft flying this route crashed into hilly terrain in the Tararua Ranges, 16 km east of Palmerston North airport, during an instrument approach in bad weather. The aircraft was carrying 18 passengers and three crew members. All passengers were New Zealand citizens except for one United States citizen. The flight attendant and three passengers died as a result of the crash.  Aircraft  An Ansett New Zealand DHC Dash 8-102 similar to the one in the incident The aircraft, registration a de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8, was manufactured in Canada in 1986. Accident During the approach to a right turn which would place the aircraft on final approach to runway 25, the right landing gear failed to fully extend so the co-pilot began to manually extend it using a hydraulic pump. The aircraft's power settings had already been reduced to Flight Idle which was normal, but the aircraft was inadvertently allowed to descend too low toward the undulating terrain leading into Palmerston North. The initial impact with terrain occurred at above sea level; an aircraft on profile should have been above sea level. Although Flight 703's Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) sounded an alarm four seconds before the aircraft hit the ground, the crew was unable to avoid the accident. According to the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) report, an audio alarm telling the crew to climb the aircraft should have sounded 17 seconds before impact, but the GPWS malfunctioned, for reasons that have never been determined. There was an investigation by the New Zealand Police in 2001 into whether or not a mobile phone call from the aircraft may have interfered with the system. The official crash report does mention the following on page 69: > \\"The aircraft manufacturer's avionics representative advised that there was > no likelihood that the operation of a computer, other electronic device or a > cell phone would have affected the aircraft's flight instruments.\\" The captain's defence was that 4.5 seconds before impact the radar altimeter display flipped 1,000 feet in altitude as he watched.  Crash site  Flight 703 pancaked onto a hilltop and broke up as it slid along the ground, killing the flight attendant instantly. Passenger Reginald John Dixon tried to free two others trapped near the wing root as the wreckage caught fire. He failed to free them and a flash fire critically burned him. He died from his injuries two weeks later. Thus, three passengers also died and many others sustained injuries. Ansett New Zealand DHC-8 ZK-NEU, sister ship of the accident aircraft For his bravery in a dangerous situation, Dixon was awarded the New Zealand Cross, New Zealand's highest award for civilian bravery. Possible radar altimeter malfunction Later study of the wreckage of Flight 703 revealed that the antennas for the radar altimeter (which sends a signal to the GPWS indicating how far above the ground the aircraft is) had been painted and this possibly reduced the GPWS' ability to provide a timely alarm, although later comments by TAIC insisted the paint did not block or reflect signals. Radar altimeter antennas are clearly embossed with the words, \\"do not paint\\", a warning that was not heeded. Bench testing of the radar altimeter proved the unit was still functioning perfectly after its recovery from the wreckage.

Early life  Mulligan was born in Drumgooland, County Down and emigrated to Australia at the age of 21 in 1860. He settled at Armidale in the British colony of New South Wales where he became a butcher and a publican. While residing there, Mulligan became involved in gold prospecting at the nearby Rocky River diggings.  Prospecting in Queensland  In 1867, Mulligan ventured north to the colony of Queensland to further pursue aspirations of fortune from gold diggings. After mediocre success at Gympie, Mulligan went to the Etheridge goldfields in the early 1870s. From there he later led a group to find payable gold on the Palmer River in Far North Queensland which had been reported by William Hann. On 30 June 1873, despite the local Aboriginal people attempting to burn down their tents, the group returned with 102 ounces of payable gold. Mulligan reported his find on 24 August to the Warden of the Etheridge Gold Field at Georgetown and the information was widely published in the press shortly after. By early 1874, Mulligan returned to the Palmer to find 3000 diggers there beset with problems like potential starvation, large biting flies and \\"the darkies\\" defending their territories. Mulligan suggested that four paramilitary Native Police camps be set up to clear the area of \\"the sneaking propensities of the blacks\\". The Palmer area was later overrun by more than 30,000 prospectors, many of whom were Chinese. Mulligan, being supportive of providing privileged status to miners of European background, became a principal organiser in anti-Chinese movements. In September 1874, Mulligan led a prospecting expedition to the south-east of the Palmer, a journey where he named the Hodgkinson River and Mount Mulligan. In 1875 he was awarded ¬£1000 for opening up the Palmer goldfields and appointed to lead a government sponsored prospecting expedition. This expedition covered and assessed an extensive region for colonial exploitation, with Mulligan naming multiple rivers and landmarks. During this exploration, Mulligan found tin ore around the headwaters of the Herbert River. In 1876, he returned to the Hodgkinson River and found gold which triggered a rush to the Hodgkinson goldfields. Mulligan lived at Thornborough on the Hodgkinson goldfield for a number of years while still maintaining prospecting pursuits. In 1880 he discovered silver in the Silver Valley west of Herberton. In the same year Mulligan also conducted an expedition with Christie Palmerston to search for gold north of the Palmer River. This mission was largely unsuccessful but Mulligan was able to describe an event where Palmerston raided an Aboriginal settlement, killing men and kidnapping a boy for use as a personal servant. Mulligan admired Palmerston's method of \\"civilising the blacks\\" as well as his prospecting skills, advocating the government to fund Palmerston to deal with Aboriginals along the Daintree River in view to create a goldfield there. In the mid 1880s, Mulligan travelled west to investigate the mineral areas around Cloncurry and worked in the town of Croydon for a number of years as a mines manager. From the early 1890s until his death in 1907, he was back in the Tablelands Region of Queensland, involving himself in various mining enterprises including tin, antimony, copper and tungsten extraction.  Later life  James Venture Mulligan's Grave in Mount Molloy Cemetery, 2010Mulligan was married in Brisbane on 5 March 1903. In that year he also purchased the Mount Molloy Hotel. He died on 24 August 1907 from pneumonia after breaking some ribs falling from a balcony while attempting to punch a man during a fight at Mount Carbine. He was buried in Mount Molloy cemetery. His headstone reads: :Memorial plaque at Mount MolloySacred to the memory of James Venture Mulligan, prospector and explorer, died at Mount Molloy aged 69 years. RIP. Erected by a few old friends.  Legacy  Mount Mulligan and the Mulligan Highway in Far North Queensland, and the Mulligan River in south-west Queensland, were named after him.

As per its original definition, the Carnegie Unit is 120 hours of class or contact time with an instructor over the course of a year at the secondary (American high school) level. Strictly speaking, this breaks down into a single one-hour meeting, on each of five days per week for a total of 24 weeks per year. However, knowing that classes usually meet for 50 minutes yields a value of 30 weeks per year. However, further complicating the computation is the fact that American schools typically meet 180 days, or 36 academic weeks, a year. A semester (one-half of a full year) earns 1/2 a Carnegie Unit. The Student Hour is approximately 12 hours of class or contact time, approximately 1/10 of the Carnegie Unit (as explained below). As it is used today, a Student Hour is the equivalent of one hour (50 minutes) of lecture time for a single student per week over the course of a semester, usually 14 to 16 weeks. History These units came about during the late 19th and early 20th centuries through a series of three disjointed events, all designed to standardize the collegiate educational experience. Prior to this time (late 19th century) admission to post-secondary education involved comprehensive examination, either by public oral process, or private written process. These processes varied greatly among U.S. colleges and universities, due to the highly subjective nature of these types of examination. Eventually, these methods were slowly discredited due to their poor reliability and validity. Charles W. Eliot at Harvard University, in the late 19th century, devised both a contact hour standard for secondary education, and the original credit hour collegiate post-secondary standard. In 1894, the National Education Association endorsed the standardization of secondary education. Widespread adoption of the 120 hour secondary standard did not occur until the Carnegie Foundation, established in 1906, began to provide retirement pensions (now known as TIAA-CREF) for university professors with the qualification that universities must enforce the 120-hour secondary standard. By 1910, nearly all secondary institutions in the United States used the \\"Carnegie Unit\\" as a measure of secondary course work. As part of their framework, the Carnegie Foundation also established that both high school preparation and college \\"work\\" would include a minimum of four years of study. On a parallel track, the Carnegie Foundation also underwrote the work of Morris L. Cooke's \\"Academic and Industrial Efficiency.\\" Again, the motive here was to standardize educational outputs and faculty workloads. Cooke established the collegiate Student Hour as \\"an hour of lecture, of lab work, or of recitation room work, for a single pupil\\" per week (1/5 of the Carnegie Unit's 5-hour week), during a single semester (or 15 weeks, 1/2 of the Carnegie Unit's 30-week period). (The Student Hour would technically be 1/10 of the Carnegie Unit: 1/5 hour per week times 1/2 year = 1/10.) Use=Academic calendars Some American colleges and universities do not use the semester as the basis of their academic calendar, but choose to use other academic terms, such as the \\"quarter\\" or \\"trimester\\" system. Most institutions also give credit for short sessions that occur in the summer or between standard semesters. In these cases, the length of the term is shortened from say 15 weeks (in a semester) to around 10 weeks for a quarter, and to as short as four weeks for shorter sessions. Then to create equity in student hours, adjustments are made either to the length of class time or to the assignment of course credit. In short sessions, including the \\"trimester\\" system, the student continues to receive credits using the standard definition of the student hour. The adjustment occurs since students meet more often or for longer periods of time. In the \\"quarter\\" system, students receive less than a full student hour, so students must take more classes to gain the equivalent class time of the semester system. When transferring credit, students' credit hours are adjusted based upon the systems used between the two institutions. Analysis Today, the Carnegie Unit and the Student Hour are a cornerstone to the administration of higher education institutions. As higher education is undertaken by the \\"masses\\" in the United States, these tools provide the ability to manage and compare students, faculty, and institutions. These units continue as the basis for evaluating student entry into college, and for determining student completion of course work and degrees. Faculty workload, efficiency, and evaluation are rooted in these units. And comparison among institutions, such as that undertaken by U.S. News & World Report, relies heavily on these units. Public and private administrators and state legislators also use these values for budgeting and planning purposes. However, many are critical of these units due to the arbitrary use of time as the basis for measuring educational attainment. Generally, the criticism is that student learning varies greatly even among individuals who teach the same material. Variations are even greater among the various faculty members, departments, topics, schools, colleges, and universities. This has become an even greater concern in this era of distance learning and telecommunication. Frustration is particularly high among those involved with transfer of credit among institutions. The Carnegie Foundation has stated that, while the Carnegie Unit system is imperfect, it is among the best measures we currently have of student learning, as well as too important for our education system, and for now it should stay.Fain, Paul, \\"Carnegie Foundation Says Credit Hour, Although Flawed, Too Important To Discard,\\" Inside Higher Ed, 29 Jan. 2015 In the future alternatives such as a competency based evaluation system may be considered.

He was best known for his work at South Africa's hominid fossil sites. He was also an activist for the eradication of apartheid and gave numerous anti-apartheid speeches at protest rallies and also to academic audiences. Academic life Born in Durban, Natal on 14 October 1925, the only son and second child of Joseph Newman Tobias and his wife, Fanny (n√©e Rosendorff), Phillip received his first schooling in Bloemfontein at St Andrew's School and in Durban at the Durban High School. In 1945, he started his career as demonstrator in histology and instructor in physiology at the University of Witwatersrand. He received his Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Histology and Physiology in 1946‚Äì1947. In 1948 he was elected President of the National Union of South African Students (NUSAS). He graduated in Medicine, Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery in 1950. He was appointed as a lecturer in anatomy in 1951. In 1953, he received his Doctor of Philosophy for a thesis entitled Chromosomes, Sex-Cells, and Evolution in the Gerbil. In 1955, Tobias started his post-graduate research at the University of Cambridge, England, where he filled the position of Nuffield Dominion Senior Traveling Fellow in physical anthropology. The following year, at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and the University of Chicago, he was the Rockefeller Traveling Fellow in anthropology, human genetics, and dental anatomy and growth. In 1959, he became Professor and Head of the Department of Anatomy and Human Biology, succeeding his mentor and eminent scholar, Professor Raymond Dart. In 1967, he was awarded a Doctor of Science in palaeoanthropology for his work on hominid evolution. During this period he attended the University of the Witwatersrand. He was Dean of Medicine from 1980 to 1982. He was appointed Honorary Professor of Palaeoanthropology at the Bernard Price Institute for Palaeontological Research in 1977 and Honorary Professor in Zoology in 1981. Also in 1981, Tobias became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. Tobias excavated at the Sterkfontein caves and worked at almost all other major sites in Southern Africa after 1945. He also opened some 25 archaeological sites in Botswana during the French Panhard- Capricorn Expedition while conducting a biological survey of the Tonga People of Zimbabwe. He was one of the anthropologists instrumental in unmasking the Piltdown fraud. Research His research has been mainly in the fields of paleoanthropology and the human biology of Africa's various populations. He has studied the Kalahari San, the Tonga people of Zambia and Zimbabwe, and numerous peoples of Southern Africa. Tobias is best known for his research on hominid fossils and human evolution, having studied and described hominid fossils from Indonesia, Israel, Kenya, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Zambia. His best known work was on the hominids of East Africa, particularly those of the Olduvai Gorge. Collaborating with Louis Leakey, Tobias identified, described and named the new species Homo habilis. Cambridge University Press published two volumes on the fossils of Homo habilis from the Olduvai Gorge. He is closely linked with the archaeological excavation at the Sterkfontein site, a research programme he initiated in 1966. The Sterkfontein caves, which were already well known by his predecessor, Professor Raymond Dart, were used as a vehicle for introducing the second year anatomy students to anthropology and have seen the most sustained excavation of a single site in the world. This site has yielded the largest single sample of Australopithecus africanus as well as the first known example of Homo habilis from Southern Africa. It is now a World Heritage Site. He published in 1970 an article in which he questioned the link between brain-size, race and intelligence. Achievements and awards Bust of Tobias at the Sterkfontein caves Tobias is one of South Africa's most honoured and decorated scientists, and a world leading expert on human prehistoric ancestors; he has been nominated three times for a Nobel Prize, received a dozen honorary doctorates and been awarded South Africa's Order for Meritorious Service. Tobias published over 600 journal articles and authored or co-authored 33 books and edited or co-edited eight others. He has received honorary degrees from seventeen universities and other academic institutions in South Africa, the United States of America, Canada and Europe. He has been elected as a fellow, associate or honorary member of over 28 learned societies. These include being elected a foreign associate of the National Academy of Sciences (USA) and a Fellow of the Royal Society of London (1996). Among the medals, awards and prizes he has received are the Balzan Prize for Physical Anthropology (1987) and the Charles R. Darwin Lifetime Achievement Award of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists (1997). The Royal Society of South Africa is very sparing with its honours, and Tobias is one of only two South African Honorary Fellows of the Society and one of very few recipients of its senior medal, the John Herschel Medal.Royal Society of South Africa Medal Winners He held the positions of Professor Emeritus of Anatomy and Human Biology at the University of the Witwatersrand, Honorary Professor of Palaeo- anthropology, Honorary Professorial Research Associate and Director of the Sterkfontein Research Unit, and Andrew Dickson White Professor-at-Large of Cornell University, Ithaca, New York USA.

He began in the chorus of a show called Ship Ahoy for $18 a week and not before too long was selling songs written with his friend, lyricists Walter H. Ford, for as little as $10 a title. Over the years Bratton would collaborate on over 250 songs with Ford and Paul West.The New York Times February 9, 1947 One of their earlier tunes was a tribute to veterans of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War called \\"Hats off to the Boys Who Made Good\\", that years later Bratton conceded was \\"terrible\\". Today he is remembered for his composition Op103, dating from 1907, \\"Teddy Bears' Picnic\\",Bratton family history, \\"Appendix ... American John Walter Bratton, The Composer of Teddy Bears' Picnic (TBP)\\" the only one of his songs to be a lasting hit. Although most of his compositions had lyrics, he left \\"Teddy Bears' Picnic\\" as an instrumental. Perhaps because it sold so well as sheet music he felt little need to do anything else with it; during the silent film era it was used as background music for a number of popular movies. Many years later British- based, but Irish-born Jimmy Kennedy wrote the lyrics. This explains why an American composition contains the British term \\"Mummies and Daddies\\" rather than \\"Mommies and Daddies\\", though the latter does crop up from time to time in copies printed in the former colony.International Lyrics Playground Tunes Bratton wrote that were popular in their day include \\"The Sunshine of Paradise Alley\\" (ca. 1895), \\"Henrietta, Have You Met Her?\\" (ca. 1895), \\"I Love You in the Same Old Way\\" (ca. 1896), \\"Isabella\\" and \\"In a Cosey Corner\\" ( ca. 1901). As half of the firm Lefler and Bratton he produced the musical comedies Hodge Podge and Co. (1900), The Star and the Garter (1900), The Man from China (1904), The Pearl and the Pumpkin (1905) and others.IBDb.com (John W.

The Republican army was commanded by Titus Labienus, Caesar's former supporter who had defected to the Republican side at the beginning of the civil war. Prelude Julius Caesar arrived at Lilybaeum in Sicily on 17 December 47 BC and built up an invasion force there to crush the Optimates in Africa. Caesar failed to gather enough transport shipping to carry his army of six legions in a single fleet and a large quantity of transport animals, food, and fodder were left behind in Sicily. Caesar hoped the supply situation would improve in Africa. He set sail on 25 December, but his poor planning based on limited information about a good landing site and strong winds scattered his convoy. Caesar landed near Hadrumentum on 28 December with only 3,000 legionaries and 150 cavalry. He fell down on the beach but dispelled his officers' superstitions by grabbing some pebbles and proclaiming \\"I have hold of you, Africa!\\". Having failed to concentrate his force, Caesar lacked the strength to besiege or compel the surrender of Hadrumentum and set up camp near Ruspina. On 1 January 46 BC, he captured the town of Leptis Parva and Corfinium soon followed, with six cohorts left to garrison the latter. Caesar marched back to Ruspina and on 4 January went off on a foraging mission, initially with thirty cohorts. Three miles out, the enemy was spotted and Caesar brought along his 400 cavalry and 150 archers as well. Caesar then personally led a reconnaissance. Battle Titus Labienus commanded the Optimate force and had his 8,000 Numidian cavalry and 1,600 Gallic and Germanic cavalry deploy in unusually close and dense formations for cavalry. The deployment accomplished its goal of misleading Caesar, who believed them to be close-order infantry. Caesar therefore deployed his army in a single extended line to prevent envelopment, with his small force of 150 archers up front and the 400 cavalry on the wings. In a surprising move, Labienus then extended his cavalry on both flanks to envelop Caesar, bringing up his Numidian light infantry in the center. The Numidian light infantry and cavalry began to wear the Caesarian legionaries down with javelins and arrows. This proved very effective, as the legionaries could not retaliate. The Numidians would simply withdraw to a safe distance and continue launching projectiles. The Numidian cavalry routed Caesar's cavalry and succeeded in surrounding his legions, who redeployed into a circle to face attacks from all sides. The Numidian light infantry bombarded the legionaries with missiles. Caesar's legionaries threw their pila at the enemy in return, but were ineffective. The nervous Roman soldiers bunched up together, making themselves easier targets for the Numidian missiles. Titus Labienus rode up to the front rank of Caesar's troops, coming very near in order to taunt the enemy troops. A veteran of the Tenth Legion approached Labienus, who recognized him. The veteran threw his pilum at Labienus's horse, killing it. \\"That'll teach you Labienus, that a soldier of the Tenth is attacking you\\", the veteran growled, shaming Labienus in front of his own men. Some men however began to panic. One aquilifer attempted to flee but Caesar grabbed the man, spun him around and shouted \\"the enemy are over there!\\" Caesar gave the order to make the battle line as long as possible and every second cohort to turn around, so the standards would be facing the Numidian cavalry in the Romans' rear and the other cohorts the Numidian light infantry to the front. The legionaries charged and threw their pila, scattering the Optimates infantry and cavalry. They pursued their enemy for a short distance, and began to march back to camp. However Marcus Petreius and Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso appeared with 1,600 Numidian cavalry and a large number of light infantry who harassed Caesar's legionaries as they retreated. Caesar redeployed his army for combat and launched a counterattack that drove the Optimates forces back over high ground. Petreius was wounded at this point. Completely exhausted, both armies withdrew back to their camps. Aftermath Caesar had been defeated, having failed in his mission of gathering supplies. However, his army remained intact; Caesar fortified his camp at Ruspina and equipped sailors as light infantry to serve on land. The army's craftsmen manufactured slingshots and javelins and Caesar sent messages to bring up as much grain and other supplies as possible. Metellus Scipio joined forces with Labienus and Petreius and they set up camp three miles from Caesar's.

(These terms are used in specific ways for this methodology‚Äîsee below). Its benefits include the ability to make precise cuts with limited blood loss. Electrosurgical devices are frequently used during surgical operations helping to prevent blood loss in hospital operating rooms or in outpatient procedures. In electrosurgical procedures, the tissue is heated by an electric current. Although electrical devices that create a heated probe may be used for the cauterization of tissue in some applications, electrosurgery refers to a different method than electrocautery. Electrocautery uses heat conduction from a probe heated to a high temperature by a direct electrical current (much in the manner of a soldering iron). This may be accomplished by direct current from dry-cells in a penlight-type device. Electrosurgery, by contrast, uses radio frequency (RF) alternating current to heat the tissue by RF induced intracellular oscillation of ionized molecules that result in an elevation of intracellular temperature. When the intracellular temperature reaches 60 degrees C, instantaneous cell death occurs. If tissue is heated to 60‚Äì99 degrees C, the simultaneous processes of tissue desiccation (dehydration) and protein coagulation occur. If the intracellular temperature rapidly reaches 100 degrees C, the intracellular contents undergo a liquid to gas conversion, massive volumetric expansion, and resulting explosive vaporization. Appropriately applied with electrosurgical forceps, desiccation and coagulation result in the occlusion of blood vessels and halting of bleeding. While the process is technically a process of electrocoagulation, the term \\"electrocautery\\" is sometimes loosely, nontechnically and incorrectly used to describe it. The process of vaporization can be used to ablate tissue targets, or, by linear extension, used to transect or cut tissue. While the processes of vaporization/ cutting and desiccation/coagulation are best accomplished with relatively low voltage, continuous or near continuous waveforms, the process of fulguration is performed with relatively high voltage modulated waveforms. Fulguration is a superficial type of coagulation, typically created by arcing modulated high voltage current to tissue that is rapidly desiccated and coagulated. The continued application of current to this high impedance tissue results in resistive heating and the achievement of very high temperatures‚Äîenough to cause breakdown of the organic molecules to sugars and even carbon, thus the dark textures from carbonization of tissue. Diathermy is used by some as a synonym for electrosurgery but in other contexts diathermy means dielectric heating, produced by rotation of molecular dipoles in a high frequency electromagnetic field. This effect is most widely used in microwave ovens or some tissue ablative devices which operate at gigahertz frequencies. Lower frequencies, allowing for deeper penetration, are used in industrial processes. RF electrosurgery is commonly used in virtually all surgical disciplines including dermatological, gynecological, cardiac, plastic, ocular, spine, ENT, maxillofacial, orthopedic, urological, neuro- and general surgical procedures as well as certain dental procedures. RF electrosurgery is performed using a RF electrosurgical generator (also referred to as an electrosurgical unit or ESU) and a handpiece including one or two electrodes‚Äîa monopolar or bipolar instrument. All RF electrosurgery is bipolar so the difference between monopolar and bipolar instruments is that monopolar instruments comprise only one electrode while bipolar instruments include both electrodes in their design. The monopolar instrument called an \\"active electrode\\" when energized, requires the application of another monopolar instrument called a \\"dispersive electrode\\" elsewhere on the patient's body that functions to 'defocus' or disperse the RF current thereby preventing thermal injury to the underlying tissue. This dispersive electrode is frequently and mistakenly called a \\"ground pad\\" or \\"neutral electrode\\". However virtually all currently available RF electrosurgical systems are designed to function with isolated circuits‚Äîthe dispersive electrode is directly attached to the ESU, not to \\"ground\\". The same electrical current is transmitted across both the dispersive electrode and the active electrode, so it is not \\"neutral\\". The term \\"return electrode\\" is also technically incorrect since alternating electrical currents refer to alternating polarity, a circumstance that results in bidirectional flow across both electrodes in the circuit. Bipolar instruments generally are designed with two \\"active\\" electrodes, such as a forceps for sealing blood vessels. However, the bipolar instrument can be designed such that one electrode is dispersive. The main advantage of bipolar instruments is that the only part of the patient included in the circuit is that which is between the two electrodes, a circumstance that eliminates the risk of current diversion and related adverse events. However, except for those devices designed to function in fluid, it is difficult to vaporize or cut tissue with bipolar instruments.  Electrical stimulation of neural and muscle cells  Neural and muscle cells are electrically-excitable, i.e. they can be stimulated by electric current. In human patients such stimulation may cause acute pain, muscle spasms, and even cardiac arrest. Sensitivity of the nerve and muscle cells to electric field is due to the voltage-gated ion channels present in their cell membranes. Stimulation threshold does not vary much at low frequencies (so called rheobase-constant level). However, the threshold starts increasing with decreasing duration of a pulse (or a cycle) when it drops below a characteristic minimum (so called chronaxie). Typically, chronaxie of neural cells is in the range of 0.1‚Äì10 ms, so the sensitivity to electrical stimulation (inverse of the stimulation threshold) decreases with increasing frequency in the kHz range and above. (Note that frequency of the alternating electric current is an inverse of the duration of a single cycle). To minimize the effects of muscle and neural stimulation, electrosurgical equipment typically operates in the radio frequency (RF) range of 100 kHz to 5 MHz. Operation at higher frequencies also helps minimizing the amount of hydrogen and oxygen generated by electrolysis of water. This is especially important consideration for applications in liquid medium in closed compartments, where generation of gas bubbles may interfere with the procedure. For example, bubbles produced during an operation inside an eye may obscure a field of view.  Common electrode configurations for devices with isolated circuits  There are several commonly used electrode configurations or circuit topologies: With \\"bipolar\\" instruments the current is applied to the patient using a pair of similarly-sized electrodes. For example, special forceps, with one tine connected to one pole of the RF generator and the other tine connected to the other pole of the generator. When a piece of tissue is held by the forceps, the RF alternating polarity electrical current oscillates between the two forceps tines, heating the intervening tissue by the previously described synchronous oscillation of intracellular ions. In monopolar configuration the patient is attached to the dispersive electrode, a relatively large metal plate or a flexible metalized plastic pad which is connected to the RF generator or electrosurgical unit (ESU). The surgeon uses a pointed or blade shaped electrode called the \\"active electrode\\" to make contact with the tissue and exert a tissue effect...vaporization, and its linear propagation called electrosurgical cutting, or the combination of desiccation and protein coagulation used to seal blood vessels for the purpose of Hemostasis. The electric current oscillates between the active electrode and the dispersive electrode with the entire patient interposed between the two. Since the concentration of the RF current reduces with distance from the active electrode the current density rapidly (quadratically) decreases. Since the rate of tissue heating is proportional to the square of current density, the heating occurs in a very localized region, only near the portion of the electrode, usually the tip, near to or in contact with the target tissue. On an extremity such as a finger, there is limited cross-sectional area to disperse the current, a circumstance which might result in higher current density and some heating throughout the volume of the extremity. Another bipolar instrument is characterized with both electrodes on the same design, but the dispersive electrode is much larger than the active one. Since current density is higher in front of the smaller electrode, the heating and associated tissue effects take place only (or primarily) in front of the active electrode, and exact position of the dispersive electrode on tissue is not critical. Sometimes such configuration is called sesquipolar, even though the origin of this term in Latin (sesqui) means a ratio of 1.5.US Patent 3987795. Electrosurgical devices having sesquipolar electrode structures incorporated therein  Dedicated non-grounded machines without a dispersive electrode Relatively low-powered high frequency electrosurgery can be performed on conscious outpatients with no grounded machines without a dispersive electrode . Operating at low currents with no dispersive electrode is possible because, at the medium RF frequencies (usually 100 ‚Äì 500 kHz) that the machines generate, the self-capacitance of the patient's body (which is between the patient's body and the machine's ground) is large enough to allow the resulting displacement current to act as a virtual \\"circuit completion path.\\" One example of such a machine is called a hyfrecator. This term began in 1940 as a Birtcher Corporation brand name Hyfrecator for \\"High Frequency Eradicator\\", but now serves generically to describe a general class of single- electrode, non-isolated (earth-referenced) low-powered electrosurgical machines intended mainly for office use. An accidental circuit completion path through an earth-ground creates the danger of a burn at a site far away from the probe electrode, and for this reason single-electrode devices are used only on conscious patients who would be aware of such complications, and only on carefully insulated tables. In such a setting, hyfrecators are not used to cut tissue, but to destroy relatively small lesions, and also to stop bleeding in surgical incisions made by blade instruments under local anesthesia.  Electrosurgical modalities  In cutting mode electrode touches the tissue, and sufficiently high power density is applied to vaporize its water content. Since water vapor is not conductive under normal circumstances, electric current cannot flow through the vapor layer. Energy delivery beyond the vaporization threshold can continue if sufficiently high voltage is applied (> +/-200 V) to ionize vapor and convert it into a conductive plasma. Vapor and fragments of the overheated tissue are ejected, forming a crater. Electrode surfaces intended to be used for cutting often feature a finer wire or wire loop, as opposed to a more flat blade with a rounded surface. Coagulation is performed using waveforms with lower average power, generating heat insufficient for explosive vaporization, but producing a thermal coagulum instead. Electrosurgical desiccation occurs when the electrode touches the tissue open to air, and the amount of generated heat is lower than that required for cutting. The tissue surface and some of the tissue more deep to the probe dries out and forms a coagulum (a dry patch of dead tissue). This technique may be used for treating nodules under the skin where minimal damage to the skin surface is desired. In fulguration mode, the electrode is held away from the tissue, so that when the air gap between the electrode and the tissue is ionized, an electric arc discharge develops. In this approach, the burning to the tissue is more superficial, because the current is spread over the tissue area larger than the tip of electrode.Electrosurgery for the Skin. Barry L. Hainer M.D., Richard B. Usatine, M.D., American Family Physician (Journal of the American Academy of Family Physicians), 2002 Oct 1;66(7):1259-66. See illustration. Under these conditions, superficial skin charring or carbonization is seen over a wider area than when operating in contact with the probe, and this technique is therefore used for very superficial or protrusive lesions such as skin tags. Ionization of an air gap requires voltage in the kV range. Besides the thermal effects in tissue, the electric field can produce pores in the cellular membranes ‚Äì a phenomenon called electroporation. This effect may affect cells beyond the range of thermal damage. Wet field electrosurgery There are wet and dry field electrosurgical devices. Wet field devices operate in a saline solution, or in an open wound. Heating is as a result of an alternating current that passes between two electrodes. Heating is usually greatest where the current density is highest. Therefore, it is usually the smallest or sharpest electrode that generates the most heat. Cut/Coag Most wet field electrosurgical systems operate in two modes: \\"Cut\\" causes a small area of tissue to be vaporized, and \\"Coag\\" causes the tissue to \\"dry\\" (in the sense of bleeding being stopped). \\"Dried\\" tissues are killed (and will later slough or be replaced by fibrotic tissue) but they are temporarily physically intact after electrosurgical application. The depth of tissue death is typically a few millimeters near the contact of the electrode. Cut If the voltage level is high enough, the heat generated can create a vapour pocket. The vapour pocket typically reaches temperatures of approximately 400 degrees Celsius, which vaporizes and explodes a small section of soft tissue, resulting in an incision. Coag When the system is operating in \\"coag mode\\" the voltage output is usually higher than in cut mode. Tissue remains grossly intact, but cells are destroyed at the point of contact, and smaller vessels are destroyed and sealed, stopping capillary and small-arterial bleeding.  Electrosurgical waveforms  Different waveforms can be used for different electrosurgical procedures. For cutting, a continuous single frequency sine wave is often employed. Rapid tissue heating leads to explosive vaporization of interstitial fluid. If the voltage is sufficiently high (> 400 V peak-to-peak) the vapor sheath is ionized, forming conductive plasma. Electric current continues to flow from the metal electrode through the ionized gas into the tissue. Rapid overheating of tissue results in its vaporization, fragmentation and ejection of fragments, allowing for tissue cutting. In applications of a continuous wave the heat diffusion typically leads to formation of a significant thermal damage zone at the edges of the lesion. Open circuit voltage in electrosurgical waveforms is typically in the range of 300‚Äì10,000 V peak-to- peak. Higher precision can be achieved with pulsed waveforms. Using bursts of several tens of microseconds in duration the tissue can be cut, while the size of the heat diffusion zone does not exceed the cellular scale. Heat accumulation during repetitive application of bursts can also be avoided if sufficient delay is provided between the bursts, allowing the tissue to cool down. The proportion of ON time to OFF time can be varied to allow control of the heating rate. A related parameter, duty cycle, is defined as the ratio of the ON time to the period (the time of a single ON-OFF cycle). In the terminology of electrical engineering, the process of altering this ratio to achieve an average amplitude, instead of altering the amplitude directly is called pulse-width modulation. For coagulation, the average power is typically reduced below the threshold of cutting. Typically, sine wave is turned on and off in rapid succession. The overall effect is a slower heating process, which causes tissue to coagulate. In simple coagulation/cutting mode machines, the lower duty cycle typical of coagulation mode is usually heard by the ear as a lower frequency and a rougher tone than the higher frequency tone typical of cutting mode with the same equipment. Many modern electrosurgical generators provide sophisticated wave forms with power adjusted in real time, based on changes of the tissue impedance.  Prevention of unintended harm  ;Burns For the high power surgical uses during anesthesia the monopolar modality relies on a good electrical contact between a large area of the body (Typically at least the entire back of the patient) and the return electrode or pad (also known as dispersive pad or patient plate). Severe burns (3rd degree) can occur if the contact with the return electrode is insufficient, or when a patient comes into contact with metal objects serving as an unintended (capacitative) leakage path to Earth/Ground. To prevent unintended burns, the skin is cleaned and a conductive gel is used to enhance the contact with the return electrode. Proper electrical grounding practices must be followed in the electrical wiring of the building. It is also recommended to use a modern ElectroSurgical Unit that includes a return electrode monitoring system that continuously tests for reliable and safe patient contact. These systems interrogate the impedance of a split or dual-pad return electrode and will alarm out, disabling further generator output in case of fault. Prior generators relied on single pad return electrodes and thus had no means of verifying safe patient connection. Return electrodes should always have full contact with the skin and be placed on the same side of the body and close to the body part where the procedure is occurring. If there is any metal in the body of the patient, the return electrode is placed on the opposite side of the body from the metal and be placed between the metal and the operation site. This prevents current from passing selectively through metal on the way to the return electrode. For example, for a patient who has had a right sided hip replacement who is scheduled for surgery, the return electrode is placed on the left side of the body on the lateral side of the lower abdomen, which places the return electrode between the location of the metal and the surgical site and on the opposite side from the metal. If there is metal on both sides of the body, the return electrode is placed between the metal and the procedure site when possible. Common return electrode locations include lateral portions of the outer thighs, abdomen, back, or shoulder blades. The use of the bipolar option does not require the placement of a return electrode because the current only passes between tines of the forceps or other bipolar output device. Electrosurgery should only be performed by a physician who has received specific training in this field and who is familiar with the techniques used to prevent burns. ;Smoke toxicity Concerns have also been raised regarding the toxicity of surgical smoke produced by electrosurgery.

Ledermann, Robert P., Chicago's State Street Christmas parade.\\" Chapter 4: \\"The Berghoff Restaurant.\\" Arcadia Publishing, 2004. pages 81-87.  History = 1800s  Herman Berghoff immigrated to America from Dortmund, Germany, in 1870. Herman and his three brothers, Henry, Hubert and Gustav, started brewing Berghoff's Beer in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1887. Herman wanted to expand the market for the family's beer and to do so he sold beer at the Chicago World's Fair of 1893. The popularity of the beer inspired Herman to open a cafe to showcase Berghoff's Dortmunder-style beer which it sold for a nickel. Sandwiches were offered for free. The bar remained open even through the prohibition period by selling the legal near beer, which contained less than 0.5% alcohol, as well as a new line of Bergo soda pops, and expanded into a full-service restaurant. Berghoff root beer, a product of Bergo soda pops, is still popular today. Cremin, Dennis H. and Penn, Elan \\"Chicago: a pictorial celebration.\\" Sterling, 2006. Page 150. After prohibition was repealed in 1933, The Berghoff was issued Chicago's Liquor License No. 1, a designation that has been honored by the city every year since. Backwell, Elizabeth Canning \\"Frommer's Chicago 2011.\\" Frommers 2010. Page 106. Long after most restaurants ended the practice, the Berghoff maintained a separate men's only bar. The segregation ended in 1969, when seven members of the National Organization for Women, led by Gloria Steinem, stood at the bar and demanded service. For much of its history, the Berghoff waiters would purchase the meals they were serving from the kitchen via a token system and then deliver them to the customer, keeping the amount the customer paid for the meals.  1900s  The founding Herman Berghoff died unexpectedly at home on December 31, 1934. The restaurant was run by two of Herman's seven children, Lewis Windthorst and Clement Anthony, who had both joined their father in the business prior to his death. Under their helm, Berghoff's grew into three restaurants under one roof: the original bar, a large two-room restaurant, and a more casual downstairs cafe, called the Annex, which was opened in 1939. Lewis and Clement were active in the restaurant until about 1960. To succeed themselves, they brought in siblings from each family, one being third- generation Herman Berghoff (Lewis's son). Management styles differed and, in 1973, Herman withdrew and moved with his wife and four children to Stevensville, Michigan. However, in 1983 Herman was asked to return by the remaining Berghoff partners. He offered to buy them out, and became the sole owner and runner of the restaurant (with his wife Jan Berghoff) in 1986.  2000s  On December 28, 2005, it was announced by Herman Berghoff, 70, and his wife Jan Berghoff that after 107 years of operation, The Berghoff would close on February 28, 2006. The restaurant's basement cafe reopened on April 18, 2006, during weekday lunch hours only, and was run by Carlyn Berghoff, Herman and Jan's daughter and the great-granddaughter of the founding Herman Joseph Berghoff. She also reopened the Berghoff's bar on May 23, 2006, under the new name \\"17/West at The Berghoff.\\" At one point, Carlyn Berghoff converted the dining room of the restaurant into a private banquet hall called \\"The Century Room,\\" however, after a year under new ownership, The Berghoff re-launched their full-service restaurant. The Berghoff Cafe at O'Hare Airport also remained open. Carlyn Berghoff also operated a catering company within the restaurant, resulting in the official name of the enterprise: Berghoff Catering & Restaurant Group. In 2016, Carlyn Berghoff, CEO of Berghoff Catering & Restaurant Group, transitioned out of the restaurant by selling her assets to Berghoff Restaurant Company of Delaware, which is owned and operated by her brother, Pete Berghoff. July 1, 2016, marked the first day that Berghoff Restaurant Company of Delaware began managing operations at 17 West Adams. Currently, the Berghoff Company operates the full-service restaurant, public bar, and cafe.  Berghoff Beer  After surviving Prohibition by selling near beer, root beer and other sodas, Berghoff Brewery of Ft. Wayne, Indiana, was sold to the Falstaff company in 1954. The Joseph Huber Brewing Company then began brewing the Berghoff Beers in 1960 under contract with Berghoff Restaurant. The original Berghoff beer brand was purchased by General Beverage Distributors in 1994, owned by the Minkoff Family. In 2006, the Minkoff family sold its brewery and began using the Minhas Craft Brewery in Monroe, Wisconsin to brew Berghoff beer. In 2013, the label was relaunched by Ben Minkoff and brewed by the Stevens Point Brewery, located in Stevens Point, Wisconsin with year-round labels including Straight Up Hefeweizen, Dortwunder Lager, Sir Dunkle Dark Lager, and Reppin' Red Ale.Shepard, Robin, \\"Wisconsin's best breweries and brewpubs: searching for the perfect pint.\\" University of Wisconsin Press, 2001, p. 170. As part of a $2.2 million expansion project that started in 2018, Berghoff once again brews its own beer that is sold at the restaurant - this time onsite as a microbrewery named the Adams Street Brewery.

Pacific whiting (hake) is primarily made into surimi, a minced fish product used to make imitation crab and other products. More recently, there has been growth in the production of hake fillets. PWCC was formed in 1997 to promote rational harvest, optimal utilization, and minimal waste in the whiting fishery. By working cooperatively, PWCC member companies have greatly improved product recovery rates and significantly decreased bycatch, notably of salmonids and rockfish, in our sector of the whiting fishery. PWCC also funds and performs research to generally improve the West Coast groundfish fishery. For example, PWCC sponsors an annual cooperative research survey with the National Marine Fisheries Service-Northwest Fisheries Science Center. The purpose of this research is to provide information about the abundance of juvenile Pacific whiting, which is used to determine the long-term health of the whiting resource. Fish harvesting practices in the catcher/processor sector of the Pacific whiting fishery changed dramatically during the 1990s. The catcher/processor fishery evolved from an Olympic-style \\"race for fish\\" into a fish harvesting cooperative that emphasizes resource conservation and efficient production. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (Pacific Council) provided the needed regulatory framework for the change when it formally divided the annual total allowable catch of Pacific whiting among three fishery sectors: vessels delivering to shoreside processors (shoreside sector ‚Äì 42%); vessels delivering to processing vessels (mothership sector ‚Äì 24%); and vessels that both catch and process (catcher/processor sector ‚Äì 34%). During this same period, the Pacific Council also imposed a license limitation program for the West Coast groundfish fishery, which limited participation in the fishery to qualified vessels. To make optimal use of the annual Pacific whiting allowable harvest allocated to the catcher/processor sector, PWCC members negotiated the apportionment of this allocation on a company-by- company basis. The agreement is enforced by a contract signed by each of the cooperative members. The PWCC fishing cooperative has ended the \\"race for fish\\" in the catcher/processor sector, resulting in decreased bycatch and waste, improved product quality, and reduced fishing effort. For example, since formation of the PWCC, only 6 or 7 of the 10 eligible catcher/processor vessels have participated in the fishery, providing a significant reduction in fishing effort. In addition to direct benefits to PWCC members, the cooperative also sponsors scientific research that benefits the West Coast groundfish fishery. PWCC members are assessed a tonnage fee that is used to fund scientific research, including funding stock assessment and bycatch avoidance programs.

UCG is an in-situ gasification process, carried out in non-mined coal seams using injection of oxidants and steam. The product gas is brought to the surface through production wells drilled from the surface.Coal Gas, www.clarke-energy.com, retrieved 12.12.2013 The predominant product gases are methane, hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Ratios vary depending upon formation pressure, depth of coal and oxidant balance. Gas output may be combusted for electricity production. Alternatively, the gas output can be used to produce synthetic natural gas, or hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be used as a chemical feedstock for the production of fuels (e.g. diesel), fertilizer, explosives and other products. The technique can be applied to coal resources that are otherwise unprofitable or technically complicated to extract by traditional mining methods. UCG offers an alternative to conventional coal mining methods for some resources. It has been linked to a number of concerns from environmental campaigners., BBC - Coal gasification: The clean energy of the future?, retrieved 12.07.2014 History The earliest recorded mention of the idea of underground coal gasification was in 1868, when Sir William Siemens in his address to the Chemical Society of London suggested the underground gasification of waste and slack coal in the mine. Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleyev further developed Siemens' idea over the next couple of decades. In 1909‚Äì1910, American, Canadian, and British patents were granted to American engineer Anson G. Betts for \\"a method of using unmined coal\\". The first experimental work on UCG was planned to start in 1912 in Durham, the United Kingdom, under the leadership of Nobel Prize winner Sir William Ramsay. However, Ramsay was unable to commence the UCG field work before the beginning of the World War I, and the project was abandoned. Initial tests In 1913, Ramsay's work was noticed by Russian exile Vladimir Lenin who wrote in the newspaper Pravda an article \\"Great Victory of Technology\\" promising to liberate workers from hazardous work in coal mines by underground coal gasification. Between 1928 and 1939, underground tests were conducted in the Soviet Union by the state-owned organization Podzemgaz. The first test using the chamber method started on 3 March 1933 in the Moscow coal basin at Krutova mine. This test and several following tests failed. The first successful test was conducted on 24 April 1934 in Lysychansk, Donetsk Basin by the Donetsk Institute of Coal Chemistry. The first pilot-scale process started 8 February 1935 in Horlivka, Donetsk Basin. Production gradually increased, and, in 1937‚Äì1938, the local chemical plant began using the produced gas. In 1940, experimental plants were built in Lysychansk and Tula. After World War II, the Soviet activities culminated in the operation of five industrial-scale UCG plants in the early 1960s. However, Soviet activities subsequently declined due to the discovery of extensive natural gas resources. In 1964, the Soviet program was downgraded. only Angren site in Uzbekistan and Yuzhno-Abinsk site in Russia continued operations. Post-war experiments After World War II, the shortage in energy and the diffusion of the Soviets' results provoked new interest in Western Europe and the United States. In the United States, tests were conducted in 1947‚Äì1960 in Gorgas, Alabama. From 1973‚Äì1989, extensive testing was carried out. The United States Department of Energy and several large oil and gas companies conducted several tests. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory conducted three tests in 1976‚Äì1979 at the Hoe Creek test site in Campbell County, Wyoming. In cooperation with Sandia National Laboratories and Radian Corporation, Livermore conducted experiments in 1981‚Äì1982 at the WIDCO Mine near Centralia, Washington. In 1979‚Äì1981, an underground gasification of steeply dipping seams was demonstrated near Rawlins, Wyoming. The program culminated in the Rocky Mountain trial in 1986‚Äì1988 near Hanna, Wyoming. In Europe, the stream method was tested at Bois-la-Dame, Belgium, in 1948 and in Jerada, Morocco, in 1949. The borehole method was tested at Newman Spinney and Bayton, United Kingdom, in 1949‚Äì1950. A few years later, a first attempt was made to develop a commercial pilot plan, the P5 Trial, at Newman Spinney Derbyshire in 1958‚Äì1959. The Newman Spinney project was authorised in 1957 and comprised a steam boiler and a 3.75 MW turbo-alternator to generate electricity. The National Coal Board abandoned the gasification scheme in summer 1959. During the 1960s, European work stopped, due to an abundance of energy and low oil prices, but recommenced in the 1980s. Field tests were conducted in 1981 at Bruay-en-Artois, in 1983‚Äì1984 at La Haute Deule, France, in 1982‚Äì1985 at Thulin, Belgium and in 1992‚Äì1999 at the El Tremedal site, Province of Teruel, Spain. In 1988, the Commission of the European Communities and six European countries formed a European Working Group. In New Zealand, a small scale trial was operated in 1994 in the Huntly Coal Basin. In Australia, tests were conducted starting in 1999. China has operated the largest program since the late 1980s, including 16 trials. Process The underground coal gasification process. Underground coal gasification converts coal to gas while still in the coal seam (in-situ). Gas is produced and extracted through wells drilled into the unmined coal seam. Injection wells are used to supply the oxidants (air, oxygen) and steam to ignite and fuel the underground combustion process. Separate production wells are used to bring the product gas to the surface. The high pressure combustion is conducted at temperature of , but it may reach up to . The process decomposes coal and generates carbon dioxide (), hydrogen (), carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (). In addition, small quantities of various contaminants including sulfur oxides (), mono-nitrogen oxides (), and hydrogen sulfide () are produced. As the coal face burns and the immediate area is depleted, the volumes of oxidants injected are controlled by the operator. There are a variety of designs for underground coal gasification, all of which provide a means of injecting oxidant and possibly steam into the reaction zone, and also provide a path for production gases to flow in a controlled manner to the surface. As coal varies considerably in its resistance to flow, depending on its age, composition and geological history, the natural permeability of the coal to transport the gas is generally not adequate. For high pressure break-up of the coal, hydro-fracturing, electric- linkage, and reverse combustion may be used in varying degrees. The simplest design uses two vertical wells: one injection and one production. Sometimes it is necessary to establish communication between the two wells, and a common method is to use reverse combustion to open internal pathways in the coal. Another alternative is to drill a lateral well connecting the two vertical wells. UCG with simple vertical wells, inclined wells, and long deflected wells was used in the Soviet Union. The Soviet UCG technology was further developed by Ergo Exergy and tested at Linc's Chinchilla site in 1999‚Äì2003, in Majuba UCG plant (2007) and in Cougar Energy's failed UCG pilot in Australia (2010). In the 1980s and 1990s, a method known as CRIP (controlled retraction and injection point) was developed (but not patented) by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and demonstrated in the United States and Spain. This method uses a vertical production well and an extended lateral well drilled directionally in the coal. The lateral well is used for injection of oxidants and steam, and the injection point can be changed by retracting the injector. Carbon Energy was the first to adopt a system which uses a pair of lateral wells in parallel. This system allows a consistent separation distance between the injection and production wells, while progressively mining the coal between the two wells. This approach is intended to provide access to the greatest quantity of coal per well set and also allows greater consistency in production gas quality. A new technology has been announced in May 2012 by developer Portman Energy wherein a method called SWIFT (Single Well Integrated Flow Tubing) uses a single vertical well for both oxidant delivery and syngas recovery. The design has a single casing of tubing strings enclosed and filled with an inert gas to allow for leak monitoring, corrosion prevention and heat transfer. A series of horizontally drilled lateral oxidant delivery lines into the coal and a single or multiple syngas recovery pipeline(s) allow for a larger area of coal to be combusted at one time. The developers claim this method will increase syngas production by up to ten (10) times above earlier design approaches. The single well design means development costs are significantly lower and the facilities and wellheads are concentrated at a single point reducing surface access roads, pipelines and facilities footprint.[9] The UK patent office have advised that the full patent application GB2501074 by Portman Energy be published 16 October 2013. A wide variety of coals are amenable to the UCG process and coal grades from lignite through to bituminous may be successfully gasified. A great many factors are taken into account in selecting appropriate locations for UCG, including surface conditions, hydrogeology, lithoglogy, coal quantity, and quality. According to Andrew Beath of CSIRO Exploration & Mining other important criteria include: * Depth of * Thickness more than * Ash content less than 60% * Minimal discontinuities * Isolation from valued aquifers. According to Peter Sallans of Liberty Resources Limited, the key criteria are: * Depth of * Thickness more than * Ash content less than 60% * Minimal discontinuities * Isolation from valued aquifers. Economics Underground coal gasification allows access to coal resources that are not economically recoverable by other technologies, e.g., seams that are too deep, low grade, or that have a thin stratum profile. By some estimates, UCG will increase economically recoverable reserves by 600 billion tonnes. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory estimates that UCG could increase recoverable coal reserves in the US by 300%. Livermore and Linc Energy claim that UCG capital and operating costs are lower than those for traditional mining. UCG product gas is used to fire combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plants, with some studies suggesting power island efficiencies of up to 55%, with a combined UCG/CCGT process efficiency of up to 43%. CCGT power plants using UCG product gas instead of natural gas can achieve higher outputs than pulverized-coal-fired power stations (and associated upstream processes), resulting in a large decrease in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. UCG product gas can also be used for: * Synthesis of liquid fuels; * Manufacture of chemicals, such as ammonia and fertilizers; * Production of synthetic natural gas; * Production of hydrogen. In addition, carbon dioxide produced as a by-product of underground coal gasification may be re-directed and used for enhanced oil recovery. Underground product gas is an alternative to natural gas and potentially offers cost savings by eliminating mining, transport, and solid waste. The expected cost savings could increase given higher coal prices driven by emissions trading, taxes, and other emissions reduction policies, e.g. the Australian Government's proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Projects Cougar Energy and Linc Energy conducted pilot projects in Queensland, Australia based on UCG technology provided by Ergo Exergy until their activities were banned in 2016. Yerostigaz, a subsidiary of Linc Energy, produces about of syngas per day in Angren, Uzbekistan. The produced syngas is used as fuel in the Angren Power Station. In South Africa, Eskom (with Ergo Exergy as technology provider) is operating a demonstration plant in preparation for supplying commercial quantities of syngas for commercial production of electricity. African Carbon Energy has received environmental approval for a 50 MW power station near Theunissen in the Free State province and is bid-ready to participate in the DOE's Independent Power Producer (IPP) gas program where UCG has been earmarked as a domestic gas supply option. ENN has operated a successful pilot project in China. In addition, there are companies developing projects in Australia, UK, Hungary, Pakistan, Poland, Bulgaria, Canada, US, Chile, China, Indonesia, India, South Africa, Botswana, and other countries. According to the Zeus Development Corporation, more than 60 projects are in development around the world. Environmental and social impacts Eliminating mining eliminates mine safety issues. Compared to traditional coal mining and processing, the underground coal gasification eliminates surface damage and solid waste discharge, and reduces sulfur dioxide () and nitrogen oxide () emissions.Shu-qin, L., Jun-hua, Y. (2002). Environmental Benefits of underground coal gasification. Journal of Environmental Sciences (China), vol. 12, no. 2, pp.284-288 For comparison, the ash content of UCG syngas is estimated to be approximately 10 mg/m3 compared to smoke from traditional coal burning where ash content may be up to 70 mg/m3. However, UCG operations cannot be controlled as precisely as surface gasifiers. Variables include the rate of water influx, the distribution of reactants in the gasification zone, and the growth rate of the cavity. These can only be estimated from temperature measurements, and analyzing product gas quality and quantity. Subsidence is a common issue with all forms of extractive industry. While UCG leaves the ash behind in the cavity, the depth of the void left after UCG is typically greater than that with other methods of coal extraction. Underground combustion produces and and lowers emissions, including acid rain. Regarding emissions of atmospheric , proponents of UCG have argued that the process has advantages for geologic carbon storage. Combining UCG with CCS (Carbon capture and storage) technology allows re-injecting some of the on-site into the highly permeable rock created during the burning process, i.e. the cavity where the coal used to be. Contaminants, such as ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, can be removed from product gas at a relatively low cost. However, as of late 2013, CCS had never been successfully implemented on a commercial scale as it was not within the scope of UCG projects and some had also resulted in environmental concerns. In Australia in 2014 the Government filed charges over alleged serious environmental harm stemming from Linc Energy's pilot Underground Coal Gasification plant near Chinchilla in the Queensland's foodbowl of the Darling Downs.http://www.governmentnews.com.au/2014/04/queensland-government-hits- underground-coal-gasification-player-linc-energy-environmental-damage-charges/ When UCG was banned in April, 2016 the Queensland Mines Minister Dr Anthony Lynham stated \\"The potential risks to Queensland's environment and our valuable agricultural industries far outweigh any potential economic benefits. UCG activity simply doesn't stack up for further use in Queensland.\\" Meanwhile, as an article in the Bulletin of Atomic Sciences pointed out in March 2010 that UCG could result in massive carbon emissions. \\"If an additional 4 trillion tonnes [of coal] were extracted without the use of carbon capture or other mitigation technologies atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels could quadruple\\", the article stated, \\"resulting in a global mean temperature increase of between 5 and 10 degrees Celsius\\".http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2013/11/12/2923951/untold-story- wyoming-proposed-coal-project/http://www.thebulletin.org/underground-coal- gasification-sensible-option Aquifer contamination is a potential environmental concern. Organic and often toxic materials (such as phenol) could remain in the underground chamber after gasification if the chamber is not decommissioned. Site decommissioning and rehabilitation are standard requirements in resources development approvals whether that be UCG, oil and gas, or mining, and decommissioning of UCG chambers is relatively straightforward. Phenol leachate is the most significant environmental hazard due to its high water solubility and high reactiveness to gasification. The US Dept of Energy's Lawrence Livermore Institute conducted an early UCG experiment at very shallow depth and without hydrostatic pressure at Hoe Creek, Wyoming. They did not decommission that site and testing showed contaminants (including the carcinogen benzene) in the chamber. The chamber was later flushed and the site successfully rehabilitated. Some research has shown that the persistence of minor quantities of these contaminants in groundwater is short-lived and that ground water recovers within two years. Even so, proper practice, supported by regulatory requirements, should be to flush and decommission each chamber and to rehabilitate UCG sites. Newer UCG technologies and practices claim to address environmental concerns, such as issues related to groundwater contamination, by implementing the \\"Clean Cavern\\" concept. This is the process whereby the gasifier is self-cleaned via the steam produced during operation and also after decommissioning. Another important practice is maintaining the pressure of the underground gasifier below that of the surrounding groundwater.

Geographically, it refers to the areas between and surrounding the Euphrates and Tigris rivers (as well as their tributaries). The Aramaic name also refers to the area around the rivers, not only literally between the rivers. The area is considered by Assyrians as their homeland. This area roughly encompasses almost all of present-day Iraq, parts of southeastern Turkey, northwestern Iran, and, more recently, northeastern Syria. The Assyrians are considered to be indigenous inhabitants of Beth Nahrain.Simo Parpola, Assyrian Identity in Ancient Times and Today, Lecture given at the March 27, 2004 historical seminar of the Assyrian Youth Federation in Sweden (AUF) \\"Nahrainean\\" or \\"Nahrainian\\" is the Anglicized name for \\"NahrƒÅyƒÅ\\" (), which is the Aramaic equivalent of \\"Mesopotamian\\".Hugoye: Journal of Syriac Studies Past and Present , Perceptions of Syriac Literary Tradition by Lucas VAN ROMPAY History=Etymology While it may be thought that the name is calqued from Mesopotamia (), the opposite is more probable. The Aramaic name has been attested since the adoption of Old Aramaic as the lingua franca of the Neo Assyrian Empire in the 8th century BCE,Finkelstein, J. J.; 1962. ‚ÄúMesopotamia‚Äù, Journal of Near Eastern Studies 21: 73-92 but the Greek name Mesopotamia was first coined in the 2nd century BCE by the historian Polybius during the Seleucid period.Geoffrey Wigoder, The Illustrated Dictionary & Concordance of the Bible, Sterling Publishing (2005). The name Bayn al-Nahrayn is also found in Arabic (, \\"between the two rivers\\"). Other, less common Classical Syriac variants of the name include B√™·πØ NahrawwƒÅ·πØƒÅ (, \\"between the rivers\\") and Me·π£ øa·πØ NahrawwƒÅ·πØƒÅ (, \\"the middle of the rivers\\"). Modern Culture The term \\"Beth Nahrain\\" is commonly used by both Eastern and Western Assyrians and acts as a united front for an autonomous Assyrian region. The following is a list of political/military organizations developed using the \\"Beth Nahrain\\" name: * Bethnahrain Women's Protection Forces * Bet-Nahrain Democratic Party * Bethnahrin Patriotic Revolution Organization * Bethnahrin Freedom Party People The Assyrians (also referred to as Syriacs, Arameans or Chaldeans) view themselves as the native people of Beth Nahrain. They speak different dialects of Neo-Aramaic depending on their geographical location within Beth Nahrain. Today, Assyrians in Iraq and Iran as well as the Khabur River Valley in Syria speak varieties of Northeastern Neo-Aramaic while the Assyrians in Turkey and Syria mainly speak Turoyo, a dialect of Central Neo-Aramaic. Other prominent ethnic groups present in Beth Nahrain include: Arabs, Armenians, Yazidis, Turkmen, Persians, Kurds and Turks. Geography Beth Nahrain occupies the land between two rivers - referring to the Euphrates and Tigris. The Tigris-Euphrates river system covers 35,600 km¬≤ and forms a major river system originating from the Taurus mountains of Eastern Turkey through Syria and Iraq towards the Persian Gulf.

It is one of the fourteen schools that comprise the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE). Founded in 1855 as the first Normal School in Pennsylvania, Millersville is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools and the Pennsylvania Department of Education. First established in 1854 as the Millersville Academy out of the since-demolished Old Main,Bicentennial Committee, 1961 the Academy specialized in a series of workshop-style teacher institutes in response to the 1834 Free School Act of Pennsylvania.Downey, Dennis B. We Sing to Thee, 2004. History Millersville University was established in 1855 as the Lancaster County Normal School, the first state normal school in Pennsylvania. It subsequently changed its name to Millersville State Normal School in 1859 and Millersville later became a state teachers college in 1927. It was renamed Millersville State College in 1959 and officially became Millersville University of Pennsylvania in 1983. The original Old Main of 1854 In November 1852, the Lancaster County Educational Association met in Strasburg to form an institute for teacher training. The first institute, which led to the Lancaster County Normal School and received major support from Thomas H. Burrowes, was held in January 1853. While the Association was working to organize, Lewis M. Hobbs, a popular teacher of the Manor district, lobbied heavily in Manor township for a more permanent training facility for teachers. Jacob Shenk, a local farmer, donated a tract of five acres (the present-day site of Ganser Library, Biemesderfer Executive Center, and Dutcher Hall) with Hobbs collecting investments from local residents. On April 17, 1855, Lancaster County Normal School opened with James P. Wickersham as principal and a peak of 147 teachers in attendance. The president of the school was Thomas H. Burrowes and vice-president was Lewis M. Hobbs. November 5, 1855, marked the start of the first full session, with a new expansion off the original Academy building that made 96 rooms available for nearly 200 students and their teachers.Graver, Lee. (1955). A History of the First Pennsylvania State Normal School. Completed in 1894, the Biemesderfer Executive Center, also known as the Old Library, is the centerpiece of Millersville University's campus. The Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees designated $27,500 for the construction of the library in 1891, with the contract awarded to Lancastrian D.H. Rapp, who submitted the lowest bid in a blind auction. The Millersville University Library is housed in Ganser Hall. In September 2011, the University closed Ganser Hall for two years for renovations. On August 26, 2013, the Ganser Library reopened as the McNairy Library and Learning Forum at Ganser Hall.

She is the daughter of Merlyn. Roma is the Omniversal Guardian, charged with the safety of the Omniverse. She is assisted in her task by Saturnyne (the Omniversal Majestrix), and the Captain Britain Corps. Publication history Roma first appeared in Marvel UK's Captain Britain series volume 1, in the first issue in October 1976, and subsequently appeared in the second volume of Captain Britain's series. The second volume was reprinted in the U.S. in the Captain Britain trade paperback. In 1978, Chris Claremont introduced Captain Britain to an international audience, fully integrating him into the Marvel Universe via a story that starred Captain Britain and Spider-Man, with Roma in a small role. Initially published as a black & white story in the UK's Super Spider-Man & Captain Britain comic, this was then coloured and reprinted in an American title, Marvel's long-running Marvel Team-Up series, issue #65. Fictional character biography=Captain Britain Captain Britain, then still a baseline human, was working as a research assistant at the Darkmoor Research Centre when the nuclear complex was suddenly attacked by a man named Joshua Stragg (the Reaver). In his efforts to escape, Brian was chased over a cliff. Roma, then calling herself \\"the Lady of the Northern Skies,\\" appeared to him and offered him the chance to become a hero. Her father, Merlyn, was with her during this first encounter with Brian. Roma urged him to choose between two weapons, the Sword of Might, or the Amulet of Right; Roma's decision to offer him salvation and power rode on this choice. Brian subsequently made the correct choice, choosing the Amulet.Captain Britain vol. 1 #1-2 Roma and her father exist in another dimension called Otherworld, operating out of Roma's Starlight Citadel. Captain Britain, or more specifically, his spirit, met them in this dimension after a battle with a villain named Lord Hawk that left him in a coma. Aside from endowing Captain Britain with great physical strength, Roma also originally gave him a quarterstaff, a weapon that could be used for direct attack or emit a protective force field. Merlyn eventually replaced the staff with Captain Britain's Star Scepter.Captain Britain vol. 1 #1-2, #27-32 Roma would eventually replace her father as the Omniversal Guardian and ruler of Otherworld, thinking her father had died. In fact, Merlyn had faked his death so he could manipulate future events while being safe from his enemies.\\"Mighty World of Marvel\\" #13 As the successor to the seemingly deceased Merlyn, she observed Captain Britain from Otherplace.Captain Britain Vol. 2 #4-6 She later brought Captain UK to an alternate Earth and reunited her with her husband.Captain Britain Vol. 2 #14 X-Men/Siege Perilous Roma appeared in human form while reaching out to a recovering and disillusioned Colossus shortly after \\"Mutant Massacre\\" and before \\"Inferno.\\" Colossus had just healed from his injuries inflicted on him by the Marauders when the X-Men were fighting to rescue the Morlocks. Roma approached him and asked him to draw a sketch of her; she offered to pay him by telling him his fortune. When he finished his sketch, she hinted at things that would happen in the X-Men's future, but remained vague enough to anger him. She disappeared from the scene, leaving behind a figurine of him in his armored (steel) form.Uncanny X-Men #225 During this encounter, Roma was really being held captive in her Starlight Citadel by the Trickster (aka the Adversary), a deity who planned on destroying the earth to remake it into whatever image he chose.Uncanny X-Men #225 The X-Men defeated the Adversary, freeing Roma and forcing the Adversary into a portal. Using Forge's spell, it took harnessing the souls of all eight active X-Men and Madelyne Pryor, who was there at the time, to create and shut the portal. Roma repaid them by retrieving their souls from the portal, which had a side effect of making them undetectable to electronic equipment and cameras, effectively making them \\"invisible\\" to their enemies.Uncanny X-Men #227, 229 Roma also bequeathed the X-Men with and made them the guardians of a mystical portal called the Siege Perilous.Uncanny X-Men #229 This portal is a gem that enlarges into a doorway. Individuals walk through the portal to have their lives and deeds judged on a cosmic scale, eventually being reborn if they are deemed worthy. X-Men who have traveled through the Siege Perilous include Rogue (accidentally sucked into it while battling the Master Mold/NimrodUncanny X-Men #246-247), Havok, Psylocke, Dazzler, and Colossus.Uncanny X-Men #251 Excalibur One of the X-Men who sacrificed herself was Psylocke, Captain Britain's sister. The grief over his sister's death united Captain Britain and his girlfriend Meggan with the surviving X-Men Shadowcat and Nightcrawler. Together they saved Rachel Summers, host to the Phoenix Force, and formed Excalibur. To keep the individualistic Captain Britain a part of Excalibur, Roma put a jinx on him. Whenever he tried to act independently of the team, he would make mistakes and fail. Roma had foreseen that Excalibur would become essential to the safety of the Omniverse; only a group with their specific talents could stop an unknown threat. Roma later warned Galactus not to slay Phoenix.Excalibur #25 Roma eventually discovered that Merlyn was still alive.Excalibur #49 Merlyn, in disguise, manipulated Captain Britain into confronting Roma and she removed the jinx and told him about the secret threat. Excalibur encountered the threat shortly afterwards: Necrom, Merlyn's teacher had been planning for millennia to use the Phoenix Force to increase his own power. Roma persuaded Excalibur to destroy Merlyn's tower in the multiversal energy matrix, but prevented Merlyn from killing Excalibur. The combined powers of Excalibur defeated Necrom as Merlyn had planned.Excalibur #50 Roma told Excalibur that from now on, they would be free to determine their own destiny.Excalibur: The Sword is Drawn, Excalibur vol. 1 #1-50 Roma was captured and impersonated by the villain Mastermind, who planned on using the Sword of Might and the Amulet of Right to reshape the Omniverse. Mastermind was defeated by Captain Britain and his friends and Roma gave the throne of Otherworld to Captain Britain, who now wielded both the Sword and the Amulet. Roma would retain her function as Omniversal Guardian though.Excalibur: Sword of Power #1-4 Fantastic Four/Franklin Richards Roma briefly appeared in Fantastic Four, when she sent Gatecrasher to kidnap Franklin Richards, thinking he was too powerful to stay on Earth and with his family.

She summoned Valeria Richards and Franklin Richards to protect them from Abraxas but was unsuccessful, since she was murdered in the process.

The house ‚Äì the oldest domestic wooden structure in downtown Cincinnati in situ ‚Äì was built about 1820 and housed several prominent Cincinnatians, including Martin Baum, Nicholas Longworth, David Sinton, Anna Sinton Taft and Charles Phelps Taft. It now holds a fine art collection, is on the National Register of Historic Places listings, and is a contributing property to the Lytle Park Historic District.  Residents  Portrait of Mr. Taft, by Joaquin Sorolla (1909) The Taft house was first built for Martin Baum in 1820 and then was the residence of Nicholas Longworth. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976, in honor of the murals on its walls that were painted by Robert S. Duncanson under the commission of Nicholas Longworth. Robert S. Duncanson painted the series of eight large- scale landscapes directly on the plaster walls of the art patron and horticulturist Nicholas Longworth's home between 1851 and 1852. Second to the Taft house itself, the murals ‚Äî recognized as the most significant pre‚ÄìCivil War domestic murals in the U.S. ‚Äî are one of the museum's largest pieces of art.Ketner, Joseph D. \\"The Belmont Murals In The Taft Museum\\", Queen City Heritage, Volume 46, No. 1 (Spring 1988), p. 51-63. Duncanson was also the first widely known African-American landscape painters to rise to international acclaim. After Longworth‚Äôs residency, the house was purchased by David Sinton, father of museum co-founder Anna Sinton Taft. David Sinton lived in the house with his daughter Anna, who married Charles Phelps Taft, the half-brother of President William Howard Taft. The Tafts lived in the house from 1873 until their respective deaths in 1931 and 1929. William H. Taft accepted his presidential nomination there from its portico in 1908 adding to its significance in our nation‚Äôs public life. The Tafts were avid art collectors. They bequeathed their home and the collection of art that filled it to the people of Cincinnati in 1927. In the Tafts' deed of gift they stated, \\"We desire to devote our collection of pictures, porcelains, and other works of art to the people of Cincinnati in such a manner that they may be readily available for all.\\" The Taft Museum opened to the public on November 29, 1932.  Museum's Permanent Collection  The museum's collections include European old master paintings, with works by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Thomas Gainsborough, Frans Hals, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Rembrandt van Rijn, Adriaen van Ostade, and J. M. W. Turner, among others, and 19th-century American paintings, including the well-known Duncanson murals. The galleries in the historic house also include Chinese porcelains, European decorative arts, Limoges enamels, watches, sculptures, and furniture.

Its western terminus is an intersection with U.S. Highway 27 (US 27 or State Road 25) in Pembroke Pines, Florida; and its eastern terminus is a trumpet interchange with State Road A1A in Hollywood, Florida. SR 820 is the southernmost of three roads in Broward County that connects US 27 and A1A, the others being Sheridan Street and Griffin Road. SR 820 also serves as the latitudinal baseline for the street grid that incorporates Hollywood, Pembroke Pines, Miramar, West Park, and Pembroke Park. Route description Pines Boulevard begins at an intersection with Okeechobee Road near the western fringes of Broward County development and the Everglades. State Road 820 follows Pines Boulevard east, as the first several miles of the road are newer residential developments, with some schools and grocery shops dotted on the road before an interchange with Interstate 75 (I-75). East of I-75, it passes through some more residential developments before becoming commercial at the intersection of Flamingo Road. CB Smith Park and Pembroke Lakes Mall are located there, which in 2001 was considered \\"most dangerous intersection in the United States\\" by State Farm Insurance. Continuing east, the road is mostly commercial dotted with some residential areas until it reaches University Drive, where Pines Boulevard becomes the northern boundary of North Perry Airport. At this point, the road to the north becomes mostly residential, and at SW 60th Avenue, Pines Boulevard becomes Hollywood Boulevard, and the road begins to form the southern border of Hollywood. Residential developments then dot both sides of the road, with Broward College south campus appearing to the north just west of the interchange with Florida's Turnpike, where SR 820 leaves Pembroke Pines and enters Hollywood, where it stays for the rest of the route. A sign on Hollywood Boulevard where it approaches downtown east of the Florida East Coast railway. SR 820 intersects Interstate 95 just east of the Hollywood Train Station East of the Turnpike, SR 820 becomes commercial again, as it quickly intersects with US 441/SR 7, with the defunct Hollywood Fashion Center on the southeast corner of the intersection. East of the old shopping center, the road again becomes residential, with multi level buildings now lining the main street along with single story houses. It then hits the Presidential Circle, the first of three large traffic circles in the Historic District of downtown Hollywood, with the center currently housing a high rise commercial building. Commercial development dots Hollywood Boulevard for a few more blocks before a few blocks of residential development, where SR 820 hits the interchange with Interstate 95. Commercial development continues east, with the road hitting the City Hall Circle, the second of the three large circles. The road then hits Dixie Highway, entering the Hollywood Boulevard Historic Business District, followed by an intersection with US 1/SR 5 which contains Young Circle, the last of the three circles and exiting the Historic District. From here to the eastern terminus, the road is residential, as it crosses the drawbridge over the Intracoastal Waterway, then ending at a trumpet interchange with SR A1A, providing access to the Atlantic Ocean beaches along State Road A1A. History State Road 820 was formed in 1945 with its current route, and was State Road 518 prior to 1945. The newly designated SR 820 would continue to be known as Hollywood Boulevard for its entire length until its western section, past Seventy-Second Avenue, was renamed Pines Boulevard after the city of Pembroke Pines was founded in 1960. \\"The Most Dangerous Intersection in America\\" In 2001, State Farm Insurance ranked the intersection of Flamingo Road and Pines Boulevard in Pembroke Pines, \\"The Most Dangerous Intersection in America\\". Using data from over a two-year period, the company found that 357 vehicular accidents happened during their study at the intersection, which is where C. B. Smith Park, Pembroke Lakes Mall, a hospital, and two shopping centers are located. This prompted the city to make drastic changes to the intersection, which included lengthening the turning lanes and adding red light cameras. The number of accidents have since dropped significantly at the intersection.

Distribution The tree lives in the cold boreal climate on moist soils in mountains or river basins at elevations of 1900-2400 m. It is very shade- tolerant, frost-resistant, and hardy, surviving temperatures down to ‚àí50 ¬∞C. It rarely lives over 200 years due to the susceptibility to fungal decay in the wood. Description Siberian fir, Abies sibirica, grows 30-35 m tall with a trunk diameter of 0.5-1 m at breast height and a conical crown. The bark is grey-green to grey-brown and smooth with resin blisters typical of most firs. Shoots are yellow-grey, resinous, and slightly pubescent. The leaves are needle-like, 2-3 cm long and 1.5 mm broad on average. They are light green above with two grey-white stomatal bands underneath, and are directed upwards along the stem. They are soft, flattened, and strongly aromatic. The cones are cylindrical, 5-9.5 cm long and 2.5-3.5 cm broad, with small bracts hidden by the scales. They ripen from bluish to brown or dark brown in mid-autumn. The seeds, 7 mm long with a triangular wing 0.7-1.3 cm long, are released when the cone disintegrates after maturity. Varieties There are two varieties: *Abies sibirica var. sibirica. Described above. *Abies sibirica var. semenovii (B. Fedtschenko) Farjon. Endemic in Kyrgyzstan. Branchlets noticeably ridged and grooved. Resin canals marginal. Cones yellow- brown, with broader bracts than those of var. sibirica. Uses Essential oils extracted from the leaves are used in aromatherapy and perfumes. The wood is soft, lightweight, and weak. It is used in construction, furniture, and wood pulp.

After serving two years in the U.S. Army, he worked as a lawyer in Boston. In 1959, he became a fellow at Harvard's Russian Research Center (renamed in 1996 the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies). Government service After publishing his first book, Who Wants Disarmament? (1960), a study of U.S.-Soviet disarmament negotiations, Barnet joined the State Department in 1961 as an aide to John J. McCloy in the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. Activist-scholar Disillusioned by his experience of the inner workings of government, Barnet left government service in 1963 to co-found, with Marcus Raskin, the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS). He served as its co-director until 1978, and remained active at the institute he had helped create until his retirement in 1998. IPS was the first influential politically activist think tank according to Sidney Blumenthal, who said that the structure of IPS served as a model for the ideologically antagonistic Heritage Foundation. From 1969, Barnet was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations foreign policy organization. Author Richard Barnet wrote Roots of War (1972), Global Reach: The Power of the Multinational Corporations (1974), one of the first books critical of the effects of what would come to be known as globalization, Lean Years (1980), an account of the environmental movement and Global Dreams (1994), an analysis of some powerful corporations. He also wrote, with his wife, Ann, Youngest Minds: Parenting and Genes in the Development of Intellect and Emotion (1998). Barnet often contributed to The New Yorker, Harper's, The Nation and Sojourners Magazine, among other publications.

Events James Holmes was the signalman at Manor House signal box. The day before the crash, his infant daughter, Rose, was taken ill and later died; Holmes had been awake for 36 hours and was extremely distressed, having ministered to the child, walked miles trying to find the local doctor (who was away from home attending to another patient) and comforted his distraught wife. He reported to the stationmaster at Otterington, Thomas Kirby, that he would be unable to work the shift on the next night, but Kirby merely asked his superiors for a relief signalman, without stating that the reason was that Holmes had reported himself unfit to work. The Assistant District Signals Inspector at York, already harassed by other emergencies, replied that there was no relief signalman available, and his superior later concurred. Forced to complete his shift, Holmes called at the Otterington signal box before walking to Manor House, asking the signalman there, Henry Eden, to notify him when the train from York arrived; his mother was due on said train, as she planned to stay and tend to Holmes' wife as he worked. He also told the Otterington signalman that he was already exhausted. It was night with a thick mist which later thickened to fog. About three hours into Holmes' shift, two express passenger trains were due from the north. These constituted the up night Scotch Express, which was divided into two separate trains. The first had left Edinburgh on time at 10:30 pm, but the second had been delayed by the late arrival of connecting trains and did not leave until 11:02 pm. After the first portion of the express had passed Northallerton North the signalman there allowed a goods train from Middlesbrough to Starbeck up the main line after it.Rolt, p.198 Holmes let the goods train into his section but then was \\"overmastered by sleep\\". The goods train came to a halt just outside his signal box. Thirteen minutes later, Holmes awoke, rather confused. The Otterington signalman warned him to be ready for the second part of the express, and Holmes saw that his instruments still indicated that there was a train on the line. He had forgotten about the goods train, and thought he had fallen asleep before clearing the instruments after the first express. He cleared the instruments and accepted the second express. He then had second thoughts and telephoned the Otterington signal box, but too late for the Otterington signalman to halt the express. The express crashed at sixty miles per hour into the goods train, which had only just started to move off at walking pace. Nine passengers and the guard of the goods train were killed. 39 other passengers and 4 train crew injured. Nearly an hour later, hot coals from the firebox of the engine of the express train set the wreckage on fire. The express train's Pintsch oil gas lighting system acted as an accelerant and added to the fire. Two of the bodies were incinerated and were not recovered. Men employed to clear the crash site and repair the permanent way reported finding calcined bones and lumps of flesh. Some of the human remains had coins fused to them from the intense heat of the fire. The bodies that could be recovered were moved to Thirsk station and an inquest was opened immediately so that the bodies could be released to the families. Aftermath Holmes was charged with manslaughter and found guilty, but was given an absolute discharge ‚Äì a decision strongly supported by both the jury and by public opinion. The railway company was criticised for its cavalier treatment of Holmes, and there had been contributory negligence; by the Otterington signalman who knew of Holmes' condition and took no action when there was silence from his signal box for nearly a quarter of an hour, and by the crew of the goods train who remained halted outside Holmes' signal box for several minutes without sending a crewman to the signal box in accordance with Rule 55 to ensure that their train was properly protected by the signals and block instruments. Prevention The accident would have been prevented if the line had been fitted with track circuits which would have prevented the block instruments and the signals from being cleared. However, at the time track circuits were relatively new. Although Manor House was a heavily used part of what was to become known as the East Coast Main Line, the need for such aids to safety there would have been regarded as low; there were no junctions, sidings or crossovers to confuse movement, and the block was one of the shortest and straightest in the country. Board of Trade Inspecting Officer Francis Marindin also noted that the many casualties were as a result of the lighter carriages being marshalled between the engine and the heavier Pullman coach behind them. When the crash occurred, the Pullman carriage tore into the lighter carriages at the front of the train.

Its purpose is to support the advancement of science and scholarship in Norway. History The Royal Frederick University in Christiania was established in 1811. The idea of a learned society in Christiania surfaced for the first time in 1841. The city of Trondhjem had no university, but had a learned society, the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters, established in 1760. The purpose of a learned society in Christiania was to support scientific studies and aid publication of academic papers. The idea of the Humboldt-inspired university, where independent research stood strong, had taken over for the instrumental view of a university as a means to produce civil servants. The city already had societies for specific professions, for instance the Norwegian Medical Society which was founded in 1833. However, these societies were open for both academics within medicine as well as physicians outside of academia. The learned society would be open to employed academics only, but from all academic branches. The idea did not come to stay in 1841. Money was a problem; also there were \\"doubts with regards to the adequacy of the scientific powers\\". However, cross-disciplinary cooperation was flourishing. The first scientific congress in Norway was held in 1844. Two hundred people within the natural sciences and medicine convened for the fourth Scandinavian meeting of natural researchers. Finally, in 1857 a source of finances were found: professor of medicine Frants C. Faye.Collett, 1999: p. 59 The academy was founded, and inaugurated on 3 May 1857 under the name . \\"Christiania\\" was later changed to \\"Kristiania\\". The name was taken in the early twentieth century,Collett, 1999: p. 108 and from 1924 \\"i Kristiania\\" was dropped, when Oslo voted to return the name to its original Norwegian name. The economic support from the state was minimal during its first fifty years. As such the academy led a humble existence. In the early twentieth century, Waldemar Christofer Br√∏gger (later the university's first rector) suggested a plan to strengthen the academy. He established the Nansen Foundation, specifically tied to the academy to strengthen its economy. Br√∏gger's goal was to employ own researchers to secure independence from the university, however this never happened. The purpose of the academy remained to advance science and scholarship in general through meetings, seminars and support of research and publications. Nonetheless, the Nansen Foundation and other economic sources were important. They helped in the establishment of other bodies, such as the early Institute for Comparative Research in Human Culture.Collett, 1999: p. 137 The foundations lost some of their importance after World War II. However, an entirely new source of funding was found, as Otto Lous Mohr suggested to use surplus from a state-owned, national lottery.Collett, 1999: p. 187 The establishment of Norsk Tipping was laid down in 1946, and took place in 1947. The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters wished to administer this income through a council of its own, but the Government of Norway refused and created the research council NAVF (, the Norwegian Council of General Research). The academy could merely suggest representatives for this council. Ever since then, the state-driven research councils have been more important than the academy, economically. NAVF and other bodies were merged in 1993 to become the Research Council of Norway. Organisation The General Meeting is the supreme body of the Academy. The board of the Academy consists of its President, Secretary General and Vice-President together with the chairman, vice-chairman and secretary of the two divisions, Mathematics and Natural Sciences and Humanities and Social Sciences. President of the Academy is professor of law, Hans Petter Graver (UiO). Vice presidents are; Gunn Elisabeth Birkelund and Anders Elverh√∏i. King Harald V of Norway is honorary president.. The Academy aims to fulfill its mission by initiating and supporting research, organizing meetings and international conferences, publishing scientific writings and appointing representatives to national and international bodies. Each year, the Academy organizes at least 12 open meetings with topics covering a wide range of academic disciplines.  Prizes and other activities  The academy is responsible for awarding the Abel Prize in mathematics and the Kavli Prize in astrophysics, nanoscience and neuroscience. It also represents Norway in the International Council for Science (ICSU), the Union Acad√©mique Internationale (UAI), the European Science Foundation (ESF) and the All European Academies (ALLEA). The academy is also part of the European Science Academies Advisory Council (EASAC) and one representative from the academy is stationed at the headquarters in Brussels. Its aim is to promote science based governing. The academy has approximately 900 members, both foreign and Norwegian. Prize winners are also added to the member lists upon being awarded.

It is situated just outside the town of Rugeley. Colton is the home to Border Collie Trust GB, a registered charity rescuing and rehoming Border Collies and Collie crosses throughout the UK. There is also a village hall and a small church. There is a bypass that has just been built near Rugeley the town nearest Colton. There is also a park for young children. Colton lies just off the B5013, which runs from Rugeley, local pronunciation 'Rudge-Lee' or 'Rewj-uh-lee', to Uttoxeter ('Utch-eater'). The village is entered by way of a hump-back bridge over the Moreton Brook, which has a ford alongside for large vehicles. It is said that in World War II, a US army lorry took the bridge at speed and overturned, killing two soldiers. St. Mary's Church stands on the right, with St. Mary's School on the left. There used to be a pool on the left a short distance beyond the school, on which people would skate, or slide, during the frequent very cold winters of the 1960s. A hundred yards further on is the Forge, where the Williscroft family would with a steel hoop re-tyre your cart wheel, make you a toboggan for use in the snow on The Martlin Hill, or dig your grave, make your coffin and conduct your funeral. Colton House had a large British Army camp during the early years of World War II. with there being no telephone at Colton House, a soldier, with a bicycle, was permanently stationed a few hundred yards up the road outside the telephone box at the bottom of Martlin Lane, to respond as necessary when the telephone rang, in true Dad's Army fashion. The telephone service in those days was part of the post office, and the soldier on duty at night would be comforted by a tray of cocoa and biscuits brought down the lane by the post-mistress's son. At the foot of Martlin Lane is the 'Pinfold'. Entering the Pinfold from the South is a public footpath which crosses the fields from Rugeley, having left the main B5013 near to the Trent Valley Railway Station. Red bricks can be seen embedded in the ground at points on this walk, and they are believed to have been laid by prisoners taken during the Napoleonic War. Alongside the Pinfold is the village War Memorial. Almost opposite is The Greyhound Inn. Continuing through the village, Malt House Farm is passed, the former home of the late prominent Euro-sceptic Tory MP Nick Budgen. High House (the former village shop) is passed, and if you continue ahead you continue to Blithbury and 'The Bull and Spectacles' Inn. However, turning left takes you further up the village. Modern houses show where a number of older houses have been replaced, until the top of the village is reached, surrounding the 'Dun Cow' Inn. The Manor Farm sits above, and Heath Way leads to the hamlet of Stockwell Heath, whose duck pond has for several generations been referred to tongue-in-cheek as 'Stockwell Heath Docks'.

The manga was serialized by Kodansha in Nakayoshi from February 1998 to March 2002 and the chapters collected into 9 tank≈çbon volumes. It was adapted into a 78-episode anime television series produced by NHK, animated by J.C.Staff, and directed by Hiroaki Sakurai, which was broadcast between March 2000 and February 2002 on NHK's BS2 broadcast satellite network. The series was one of the top-rated anime series during its initial broadcast. The story follows two junior high school students, Miyu and Kanata, who find (and take care of) an abandoned alien baby without anyone discovering they are living together. The anime concluded before the manga did, resulting in different endings for each series. Kawamura later wrote a sequel to the manga, . Plot Miyu Kouzuki is an 8th-grade student whose parents leave for the United States to work for NASA and arrange for her to stay with their long-time family friend, H≈çsho Saionji, a monk who lives in an old temple on a hill overlooking the town of Heiomachi. However, H≈çsh≈ç leaves soon after on a year-long pilgrimage to India, leaving Miyu to stay in the same house with his son, Kanata. Suddenly, a UFO lands in the honden of the temple. Inside is a humanoid alien baby, Ruu, and his cat-like \\"sitter pet\\", WannyƒÅ. They arrived on Earth from their home planet, Otto, when they fall into an interplanetary wormhole (a time warp which can transport objects across several regions, planets and time planes). They cannot return to their home planet because it is too far from Earth; WannyƒÅ asks Kanata and Miyu to allow them to stay in their house, and they agree. Miyu and Kanata learn from WannyƒÅ that people from Planet Otto look identical to human beings, and that WannyƒÅ can also transform into human beings, animals and objects. Miyu and Kanata feel deep love for Baby Ruu, who also cares for them ‚Äì thinking of them as his parents due to their similar looks ‚Äì and they go to great lengths to help and protect him and Wannya. As the story progresses the group are often involved in comedic and funny situations, but their sense of family deepens. Kanata will soon realise that he is in love with Miyu but finds it hard to confess same as Miyu. The story ends with a rescue team from outer space coming to Earth and returning Ruu and WannyƒÅ to Otto safely. Miyu goes to boarding school alone. However, 6 years later Miyu and Kanata reunite, marry and have a daughter named Miu; they also reunite with Wannya and Ruu. In Shin Daa! Daa! Daa!, set many years later, Ruu meets a confused earthling girl called Miu that has arrived through a wormhole. Miu desperately wants to go home and he agrees. Unbeknownst to him, Miu is the daughter of the same people who lovingly cared for him during his stay on Earth, Miyu K≈çzuki and Kanata Saionji. They meet Ran, Ruu's best friend, a robot named Ann and MininyƒÅ, WannyƒÅ's son. Characters ; : The main female character, a blonde, beautiful girl. Her parents leave for the United States to work for NASA at the beginning of the series, arranging for her to stay with their long-time family friend, H≈çsh≈ç Saionji, a monk who lives at and runs an old Buddhist temple atop a hill. H≈çsh≈ç leaves soon after to spend a year in India, leaving Miyu with H≈çsh≈ç's son Kanata alone together. :Miyu often argues with Kanata at the beginning of the series, but finds out from her mother that they were childhood friends and begins to like him more and more, coming to love Kanata as the story progresses. At first, Miyu denies her feelings for him, but soon she begins to realize that she indeed likes him. In the manga, it is revealed that Miyu and Kanata have kissed twice. In volume 9 (chapter 46, page 34), Miyu wanted to tell Kanata her true feelings towards him but could not. She also had a crush on Mizuki Yamamura, Mikan's younger brother; in one episode, when she and Kanata help Mikan in her manga, there was a character whom Miyu admired. Saying that he is her ideal, she went to Mikan's apartment and saw Mizuki. In the manga, Hanakomachi Kurita (Momoka's older brother) has a crush on Miyu, which makes her uneasy. :She feels a deep affection for Ruu, who feels like she is his mother due to their similar looks. Miyu is shown as an ordinary girl with a kind, generous, motherly personality. She is cheerful, with a ready smile, but also has a soft heart that is easily touched. In the episode \\"Nozomu-kun Goes to the Dream World\\", Miyu's deepest dream is to be together with her family (including Kanata's family ‚Äì H≈çsh≈ç and his late wife Hitomi ‚Äì Ruu's family and WannyƒÅ. She seems very caring towards Christine when, in the episode \\"The Hike of Fear\\", she told WannyƒÅ not to hurt Christine. Chapter 41 reveals that Miyu is younger than Kanata. In the manga ending (which differs from the above- mentioned anime) Miyu did not change schools. Although they care for each other, Miyu and Kanata frequently argue, but in Episode 55, they admit their feelings for each other. Years later, she is shown married to Kanata, living with him at the temple. Their daughter, Miu, meets Ruu when she is 12 years old; this story is continued in the manga Shin Daa Daa Daa. :Miyu's name is from Mi (Miki) and Yu (Yume). ; : The male protagonist, who is among the most popular boys in his school ‚Äì especially with the girls, due to his good looks and attitude. Not only does he excel in his studies, he is also good at sports. Shortly after Miyu arrives at the temple, Kanata's father H≈çsh≈ç declares his intent to leave for a year-long trip to India to try to find enlightenment. He promptly leaves Kanata and Miyu alone living in the same house; Miyu begins attending Kanata's school. The two have difficulty keeping their living together a secret, so they use the story that they are cousins as a cover. Kanata learns from Miyu's mother that they were childhood friends; he begins to like Miyu more and more, coming to love her as the story progresses (but he still teases her to mask it). Ruu calls Kanata \\"Papa\\", since he looks similar to his real father. Kanata‚Äôs best friend since childhood is Santa Kurosu. :Kanata is an easygoing person who does not like to talk very much, unlike Miyu. Although he seems quiet and a bit cold, Kanata is a loving, caring person. He has feelings for Miyu, but often makes a joke of it or sticks out his tongue to hide them. Initially, he refuses to express his true feelings for others. He was also often jealous of Seiya Yaboshi in episode 12, where he was mad at and worried about Miyu. He reveals his attraction to Miyu in episode 55 of the anime. :Kanata's favorite food is pumpkin in all its varieties: boiled, squashed, or fried as chips. In \\"The Blackout Halloween\\", it is revealed that Kanata had liked pumpkin since he was a baby, after his late mother fed it to him for the first time. His mother Hitomi died when Kanata was three years old; she was a good friend of Miyu's mother Miki. Kanata loved his mother very much, even though he had only known her for a short time. In chapter 41 of the manga, when Miyu and the others travel back in time, Kanata returns to when his mother was still alive. Miyu (who was wearing a yukata given her by Kanata) meets Kanata's mother; they are both wearing the same yukata. :In the manga, after Ruu and WannyƒÅ return home to Planet Otto, Kanata confesses his love to Miyu and kisses her. Years later, he succeeds his father as the resident priest of Saionji, and is married to Miyu. Their daughter, Miu, meets Ruu when she is 12 years old; this story is continued in Shin Daa Daa Daa. ; also known as Lou : Ruu is an alien baby from Planet Otto, who can levitate and perform telekinesis on objects. He develops a deep love for Miyu and Kanata, thinking of them as his parents, and often helping them. He uses his abilities at inappropriate times, causing great trouble for Miyu and Kanata. Although he is a baby, he understands everyone. Ruu does not like when Miyu and Kanata fight, as he demonstrates in the 25th episode \\"With Ruu-kun at the Department Store\\". In that, Ruu makes peace between his two \\"earth\\" parents. He is also revealed as an ordinary baby, who cries and laughs as \\"earth\\" babies do. To keep others from learning the truth about Ruu's identity, he is referred to as Miyu's little brother (although Ruu denies that, and insists on calling Miyu \\"Mama\\". Ruu believes Miyu and Kanata are his real parents, and does not learn the truth until the end of the series). In Shin Daa! Daa! Daa!, he finally saw and remembered his two \\"earth\\" parents after the accident. Ruu also develops feelings for Miu Saionji (the daughter of his earth parents) and confesses to her throughout the manga. ;Miu Saionji (Ë•øÈÅ†ÂØ∫Êú™ÂÆá) : Miu Saionji is Kanata and Miyu's daughter. She is in 6th grade and is currently 12 years old. She arrives at the planet Otto through a wormhole. Miu develops her feelings for Ruu through the series of the manga. ; : WannyƒÅ (also known as Baumiao, a play on \\"Bow-meow\\") is a cat-like alien \\"sitter pet\\" from Otto, entrusted to take care of Ruu. He can transform into a human being (his most common ones being a young blond man vaguely identified as Miyu‚Äôs relative and whom Mikan once liked, a dark-red-haired woman passed off as a housewife from the neighbourhood, or H≈çsh≈ç), an animal or an object. He develops a passion for mitarashi dango (dumplings in sweet soy-based sauce), and writes about the day's events in his computerized \\"sitter pet\\" diary. WannyƒÅ does all the cooking and cleaning in the house. He addresses Ruu as \\"Ruu-chama\\" (likely a portmanteau of chan, a term of endearment for children, and sama, a title denoting respect). ; : Nicknamed \\"Chris\\", Christine is Miyu and Kanata's pink-haired, half-French (through her mother) and wealthy classmate. She is so infatuated with Kanata that she is prone to romantic fantasies about him, and becomes jealous when she sees him other girls, especially Miyu. When she sees the latter with Kanata, she jumps to conclusions about their situation and expresses her rage by demonstrating superhuman strength, picking up large objects (such as trees and desks) to throw or knocking down whole buildings. When she snaps out of one of her \\"episodes\\", she profusely and politely apologises, proceeding to fix the damage with tools (construction equipment, for example) kept in her magic satchel. Her jealous rampages and dark fantasies are usually shown for comic effect, but these are sometimes used in serious situations. Chris, however, appears oblivious to her supernatural powers; she is for the most part shy, kind, and friendly, often speaking in very formal Japanese. Coming from a rich family, her possessions include a vast estate, a winter lodge and a snow- capped mountain. :In the manga, Chris learns of Ruu's secret early on and promises not to tell, stating that she was ridiculed as a child for her red hair and uncommon appearance. In the anime, however, she does not discover his secret until the last few episodes. Christine's parents are never seen in the anime; the only visible adult in her household is the Hanakomachi butler Mr Shikada (\\"Mr. Deerfield\\" in English translations), who is dressed in a deer costume. He has been doing this for Chris since her childhood to make her happy, because of her love for deer. Her favorite pastimes include skiing and horseback riding. ; : Christine's 3-year-old cousin. Momoka often rides her tricycle, and she is in love with Ruu, declaring that he is her boyfriend, going as far as to saying that she wants to marry him. Momoka has a grudge against Miyu and other older girls; she often calls them obƒÅ-chan, or \\"Madam\\" ‚Äì a title used for an elderly woman or a grandmother, which infuriates Miyu. She appears to like Kanata very much, however, admitting he is cute and calling him \\"Kanata onii-chan\\". Momoka learns Miyu and Kanata's secret about aliens in their house in the episode \\"Momoka's Passport\\", when she saw Ruu fly up to recapture a balloon. From Episodes 4 to 30, she insists that men and women, no matter what their ages are, do not cry, but in Episode 31, it may be revealed that she was lying about that, saying that it's all right to cry, and viewers can tell by the look on her face when she cried with Ruu and Wannya, who are dressed as Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Santa Claus, respectively, in the show's first Christmas episode. ; : Aya is Miyu and Kanata's classmate, who is a very good friend of Miyu; they often go shopping with Nanami. She has greenish hair, with two braids. She likes writing and staging school plays (which she often directs). Much to Miyu and Kanata's displeasure, some of Aya's plays or projects are similar to their current life; they get annoyed when she casts Miyu and Kanata in lead roles. Things become much worse when Aya develops an interest in Ruu, and also features him in her plays. Occasionally, Aya will start speaking French when she gets excited. Sometimes when she gets an idea for a new play, an orange will appear on her head (similar to Mikan's); she says she is in \\"Mikan mode\\" when this happens. ; : Nanami is Miyu and Kanata's classmate. She has short brown hair, and is a very good friend of Miyu; she often goes shopping with her and Aya. Nanami is usually very playful and energetic, but can sometimes get very tired after a hard task. She also has a huge appetite, and likes old-school-style clothes. ; : Santa is Kanata's best friend, who is weird and often comes up with strange ideas. He loves old recordings. Miyu once thought that Santa had fallen in love with a girl, but later finds out that it was the girl's camera he admired. He first met Kanata through a TV show named Cactus Man (named for the main character), which had low ratings and was cancelled early. Kanata liked the show, though, because he felt the hero had more courage than other heroes. One day, while wearing a Cactus Man costume, he meets Santa (who is wearing an identical costume). Soon afterwards, they place their costumes in a time capsule, opening it ten years later with Miyu, Ruu, and WannyƒÅ witnessing them. He has a pen pal, with whom he becomes friends; before she leaves for Germany, the two meet each other in person. :Santa's name is a play on the Japanese pronunciation of \\"Santa Claus\\", though this has no direct relation to his character. At the end of the manga he was dating a celebrity, Kyouko. ; :In his eyes, he is Kanata's rival. Nozomu is a classmate of Miyu and Kanata, who has blond hair. He has a pet bird named Okame, who helps him give out roses to the girls. He first appears at the start of the second season. Because he is continuously stalking Miyu, she begins to think he is an alien; she finds out later that Nozomu is interested in Kanata instead. At the end of the manga Nozomu becomes a magician, with Okame his assistant. :There are some differences in Nozomu's character between the manga and anime. In the manga, he was far more selfish and while he flirted with every girl like he did in the anime, none of them knew he flirted with everyone as they each believed he only flirted with one of them while in the anime he is more universal and open with his flirting as he flirts with every girl he sees, though the girls don't mind (possibly since he is not flirting with each one behind their backs). Also, during the beauty pageant which he competed in with Kanata to see who was the best (Kanata didn't really care but Nozomu did) while taking pictures of Kanata to enter into the competition, in the anime he saw Kanata push Mikan and thought he was attacking her and sent it in to show everyone what a bad person he seemed to be. However, upon earning it was a misunderstanding, he bowed his head and apologized to Kanata, demonstrating he truly did not mean harm and wanted a fair competition. In contrast, the Nozomu in the manga is far more devious and low as he purposely altered the picture to make Kanata look bad, showing he didn't mind cheating to win. ; :A budding manga artist, Mikan often sports a tangerine on her head (as do her relatives, including her pet Scottish fold cat) and her eyes are almost always shut. She is a very good friend of Kanata and Miyu, both of whom she helps; in turn, they help her with her manga. She has a handsome younger brother, Mizuki Yamamura, an inspiration for one of the characters in her manga who helps her with it. Mikan is often in a panic because of deadlines; she visits Kanata for consolation, and nearly finds out Miyu and Kanata's secret several times. Mizuki points out that Mikan never gave up on her dream on becoming a manga artist, despite her father's wish for her to become a baker. So far, Mikan has been successful in her chosen career. Although Mikan is often drawn comically and appears plain and stressed, she is pretty when wearing makeup and relaxed. :An avatar of the manga's author, Mika Kawamura. Her name Mikan means \\"tangerine\\" and Yama \\"mountain\\". ; : Miki is Miyu's astronaut mother, who is obsessed with anything connected with outer space. She is hired by NASA (with her husband, Y≈´) at the beginning of the story, and must leave for the United States. She arranges for her daughter, Miyu, to live with the Saionjis. Her two childhood dreams were to have a beautiful daughter and to become an astronaut, both of which came true. She was friends with Kanata's mother, Hitomi, since they were teenagers. ; : Y≈´ is Miyu's astrophysicist father; he helps his wife with her work and is also hired by NASA. He became interested in astrophysics to further his wife's dream of becoming an astronaut and traveling in space. In episode 40, it is shown that Y≈´ met Miki when they were in college and he asked her to join the astronomy club. ; : Kanata's father is a Buddhist monk, the patriarch of the Saionji household and head priest of its temple. He seems very irresponsible, embarking on a pilgrimage to India soon after Miyu arrives at the Saionji household. In episode 40, it is explained that he met his wife Hitomi when she visited Saionji and asked him to take a picture of her, Miki, and their friends. The two began a long-distance relationship, reuniting after Hitomi had graduated from high school. Devastated by her death when Kanata was a toddler, he bursts into tears whenever she is discussed. This makes it difficult for Kanata to know more about her from his father. ; : Kanata's late mother, who was a very good friend of Miyu's mother, Miki. She died when Kanata was still a child, and was buried on the grounds of Saionji. She seems to have been a kind and beautiful person. While in college, Hitomi encouraged Miki to continue pursuing her dream of becoming an astronaut when the latter doubted herself. ; : Miyu and Kanata's class teacher she possesses numerous talents ranging from cooking to ninja-training. She is also a friend of Mikan. ; :Seiya is a blond alien who visits Earth and takes a liking to Miyu, often shapeshifting as Kanata to get close to her. His kind can read minds through a touch of the hand. He first appears in Episode 12; after touching Miyu's hand, he read her mind and wanted to take Ruu to planet Sharaku (his home planet) to appear on a television programme. People from Planet Otto were rare, but after reading Miyu's hand he understood that Ruu was precious to her and Kanata, causing him to cease pursuit of Ruu. Seiya has a sister, Rui, who saved him from being sucked into a wormhole, and has had a sheltered childhood. His surname, Yaboshi, means \\"night star\\". ; :Rui is Seiya's older sister, who greatly cares for him. Seiya appears annoyed with her but truly cares for her, as seen Episode 28. She works at the Space Police Force cafeteria. ; :Rui's lover, who is Space Police Force's Space Detective. He is an honest yet hot- blooded man. His appearance is an homage to the tokusatsu genre. ; :The eccentric principal of Miyu and Kanata's school, who is extremely fond of monkeys, bananas and video games (especially monkey-based ones). His fascination with the creatures stemms from his friendship with his pet monkey, , from whom he was separated in childhood when Monkichi was sucked into a wormhole. They are later reunited thanks to Miyu, Kanata, Ruu and WannyƒÅ. Monkey dolls and figures adorn his office, where he is often found playing video games; he sometimes organizes school programs with monkey-based themes, much to the chagrin of the students. ; :A rabbit-like alien who becomes Ruu's pet in the second season, he accidentally fell out of a truck from outer space. He is a considerable glutton, and is oftentimes at odds with WannyƒÅ. In the manga he is all white, and debuts late in volume seven; in the anime, his ears and tail are coloured pink. ; :The eldest of the three sisters in the Waruwaru Dan, she is a blonde woman who always put on dark glasses. Because they are poor, the Waruwaru Dan constantly plot to kidnap Ruu to get the TV show prize money. However, they will always fail. She makes various strange machines to help make ends meet; she was once a scientist who studied a space- time distortion on Planet Sharaku. ; :The middle Waruwaru Dan sister, she is a girl who wears Monpe (traditional Japanese work clothes for women). When not trying to kidnap Ruu, she and Guava are unsuccessfully selling various Inventions that most people find useless.. ; :The youngest Waruwaru Dan sister, Guava is always in a round, bright blue costume with bear ears. She is in love with Hikarigaoka. ; :Akira is Kanata's childhood friend, who appears in episodes 33 and 34. She has long, black hair, and violet eyes. Four years before the series‚Äô timeline, Kanata made a promise to her that they would watch the sunset together at Fantasy Park, which came true after she visited him when her father was on a business trip. Akira has a crush on Kanata, demonstrated by their conversation on the ferris wheel; she said to herself, \\"There is no one I like in America\\" when Kanata told her the sunsets must be beautiful in America. In the manga, she wants to feel what Miyu feels for Kanata by giving Kanata a fake kiss. ; :A manga-only character, who appears in chapter 15. Kurita is Momoka's older brother, who falls in love with Miyu at first sight. Kawamura describes him as seemingly nerdy \\"because he is always wearing those plain glasses, he seemes to be a plain-yet-innocent boy\\". Kanata describes him as someone who expresses his feelings honestly. When Kurita's glasses were knocked off accidentally, Miyu sees that he is a handsome boy.

In a span of six years, from 1972 to 1978, he directed nine feature films in such genres as horror and action. Girdler also wrote and produced three of his features, Abby, Sheba, Baby and The Manitou. Career Girdler, born in Louisville, Kentucky, started Studio One Productions in his early 20s and directed his first feature, a low-budget film entitled Asylum of Satan which was briefly released to theaters. Girdler's second effort was a slasher thriller entitled Three on a Meathook. Both Asylum of Satan and Three on a Meathook were filmed in his hometown, and although both films received little notice, they got the attention of Samuel Z. Arkoff and American International Pictures (AIP). Girdler next directed three \\"blaxploitation\\" films. The first, in 1973, was a long-lost thriller titled The Zebra Killer starring Austin Stoker. By coincidence, another Louisville native, Rich Miles, appeared in this picture in a small role as the local cop who discovers some of the bodies. Girdler's next feature was an Exorcist clone titled Abby with Carol Speed in the lead role and co-starring William H. Marshall (from Blacula) and Oscar nominee Juanita Moore. Abby became Girdler's breakthrough film. The picture opened in 1974 to major box office success, earning nearly $9 million. Warner Brothers thought Abby was too derivative of The Exorcist and the film was suddenly pulled from theaters after two weeks. The last \\"blaxploitation\\" film Girdler directed was the Pam Grier vehicle Sheba, Baby and his first effort in the action genre. Sheba, Baby was another major hit in theaters, even though it is often cited as one of Pam Grier's weaker vehicles when compared to her similarly themed action films Coffy and Foxy Brown. Girdler was then finished with his contract with Arkoff and AIP. Girdler's sixth feature film was another action-themed film reminiscent of The Killer Elite, starring Leslie Nielsen, in one of his more serious roles as an agent tracked by the government in the political thriller Project: Kill, which was given a limited theatrical release. Grizzly, released in 1976, was Girdler's most financially successful film. A Jaws clone from start to finish, the film was about an oversized grizzly bear terrorizing a national park. The movie starred Christopher George, Andrew Prine and Richard Jaeckel and went on to become one of the most successful motion pictures of the year, earning an impressive $39 million worldwide. After this triumph, Grizzly's producer and distributor, Edward L. Montoro and Film Ventures International decided to keep the financial profits. Girdler (and the film's screenwriters/producers Harvey Flaxman and David Sheldon, who also worked with Girdler on previous films) sued Montoro and Film Ventures to have the profits returned. Girdler then directed Day of the Animals, another effort for Montoro which is sometimes cited as a sequel to Grizzly. The film had an all-star cast, including Christopher George, Lynda Day George, Richard Jaeckel, and Leslie Nielsen. It was Girdler's second approach to nature-versus-man films, but was not as successful as Grizzly. The Manitou was the last film directed by Girdler. Based on a best-selling novel by Graham Masterton, and starring Tony Curtis and Susan Strasberg, The Manitou was perhaps Girdler's most expensive production. It was acquired by AVCO Embassy Pictures, released in 1978 and was also a major hit in theaters. Death He was killed in a helicopter crash in Manila, Philippines on January 21, 1978, while scouting locations for his 10th film project.

The band started in the early 1990s under the name Manhole. Due to legal reasons they changed it after the release of their first album All Is Not Well. While the music was brutal and powerful, the lyrics of the first album were strongly influenced by singer Tairrie B's hardships as a woman having dealt with a dysfunctional family and violence. Their second (and final) offering was the religious influenced Relief Through Release. Throughout their career, the band has shared the stage with rock big names such as Human Waste Project, Snot, Marilyn Manson, Deftones, Type O Negative, Incubus and Limp Bizkit. After they disbanded, Tairrie B went on to form My Ruin and Brian Harrah went on to play in Professional Murder Music and subsequently The Mercy Clinic which featured Pat Lachman, former vocalist for Damage Plan. Bassist Rico Villasenor went on to play in Downset, as well as Drunk with Power and Demean, both featuring Downset guitarist Brian \\"Ares\\" Schwager.

Batchelder was a truckman employed by the Marshals, and assigned to stand guard at the Boston Court House, where Anthony Burns, an escaped slave captured by slave-hunters, was imprisoned. President Franklin Pierce was determined to turn over an escaped slave from Boston - a center of abolitionist activity - in order to show Southern politicians that Northern states would enforce the Fugitive Slave Act, a key provision of the Compromise of 1850. On the night of May 26, 1854, a crowd of black and white Bostonians, planning to rescue Burns, tried to force the doors of the Court House with axes, and a long plank used as a battering ram. There was a confused struggle as the crowd was turned back by the guards at the Court House. Gunfire broke out between the guards and the crowd. James Batchelder was mortally wounded by a blade of some kind. Accounts vary as to whether he was stabbed more than once. In one account, Batchelder was killed by a blunderbuss. The marshals physically blocked the crowd from forcing their way into the Court House, until Boston police and a military patrol arrived to disperse the crowd and make arrests. Burns was ultimately forced back into slavery in Virginia, with Pierce deploying federal artillery and United States Marines to ensure the enforcement of the law. In his autobiography Cheerful Yesterdays, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, one of the leaders of the rescue party commented \\"There had been other fugitive slave rescues in different parts of the country, but this was the first drop of blood actually shed. In all the long procession of events which led the nation through the Kansas struggle, past the John Brown foray and up to the Emancipation Proclamation, the killing of Batchelder was the first act of violence. It was like the firing on Fort Sumter, a proof that war had begun.\\" References *Willard, Joseph A. Half A Century With Judges and Lawyers. Wm. S. Hein Publishing, . *Runyon, Randolph Paul.

The route extends from an intersection with Sunrise Boulevard (SR 838) near downtown Ft. Lauderdale, north to an intersection with Glades Road (SR 808) near Boca Raton. Like Military Trail (State Road 809) to the east, State Road 845 is a major commuter highway paralleling Florida's Turnpike (State Road 91) and Interstate 95 (State Road 9) and often used as an alternative for the often-congested expressways. The road received its namesake from the parallel high tension power lines for almost its entire length. Route description SR 845 begins at an intersection with SR 838 (Sunrise Boulevard) in the city of Fort Lauderdale. SR 845 runs north along Powerline Road (NW 9th Avenue). The route is a four-lane road until the intersection with NW 13th Street, where it becomes six lanes. Crossing the South Fork Middle River, SR 845 crosses into Wilton Manors. Soon the road crosses into Oakland Park, where it reaches an intersection with SR 816 (Oakland Park Boulevard). A block west of SR 845 is an interchange with Interstate 95 (I-95) at exit 31\\\\. After crossing NW 40th Street, SR 845 crosses under I-95 and begins to parallel the freeway. The route crosses and parallels Tri-Rail tracks. Crossing back into Fort Lauderdale, SR 845 reaches a junction with FL 870 (Commercial Boulevard). Just east of the intersection is exit 32 on I-95 and reaches an intersection with NW 59th Court, which connects to the Cypress Creek station of Tri-Rail. Soon SR 845 reaches Cypress Creek Road (County Road 840), which connects to exit 33\\\\. The route passes west of Pompano Park Racetrack in Pompano Park. Crossing into Pompano Beach, SR 845 crosses SR 814 (Atlantic Boulevard). Continuing north, SR 845 crosses into Deerfield Beach and reaches a junction with SR 834 (Sample Road). Later, the road crosses at-grade with SR 869 (NW 10th Street), which connects to the Sawgrass Expressway, a toll road. Reaching Butler's Corner, SR 845 reaches a junction with SR 810 (Hillsboro Boulevard). SR 810 is the last major junction in Deerfield Beach as the road crosses into Palm Beach County. Now in Boca Raton, the route continues north and reaches Palmetto Park Road (CR 798). After CR 798, the route bends northeast and soon northward to a junction with SR 808 (Glades Road). The junction with SR 808 marks the northern terminus of SR 845 and Powerline Road. Powerline continues north as Jog Road, which crosses through Palm Beach County.  History  On 19 December 2017, the Palm Beach County Board of Commissioners approved a transfer agreement to submit to the Florida Department of Transportation. The agreement relinquished the portion of SR 845 in Palm Beach County to county maintenance, relocating its northern terminus to the Broward-Palm Beach County line at the bridge over the Hillsboro Canal.

Quong Wing was a naturalized Canadian citizen, originally from China, who ran a restaurant in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. In 1912, he attempted to hire two white women, Mabel Hopham and Nellie Lane, to work as waitresses. Consequently, he was charged and convicted under a provincial statute, An Act to prevent the Employment of Female Labour in certain capacities,An Act to prevent the Employment of Female Labour in certain capacities, Statutes of Saskatchewan 1912, c. 17. which prohibited white women or girls from working in businesses owned by \\"Chinamen\\". Wing appealed, arguing that the law was outside the power of the province as laws related to morality were considered criminal matters which is the exclusive authority of the federal government. As well, he argued that the law did not intend to include naturalized citizens. The Supreme Court held in a four to one decision that the law was valid. The Court interpreted the word \\"Chinaman\\" as including all those born in China regardless of subsequent nationality. Justice John Idington, alone in dissent, was the only one concerned with the justification of the law and held the law to be invalid on the basis that citizenship was a matter of federal jurisdiction and so ultra vires of provincial powers.

Thus a holomorphic function is completely determined by its values on a single open neighborhood in D, or even a countable subset of D (provided this contains a converging sequence). This is not true for real-differentiable functions. In comparison, holomorphy, or complex-differentiability, is a much more rigid notion. Informally, one sometimes summarizes the theorem by saying holomorphic functions are \\"hard\\" (as opposed to, say, continuous functions which are \\"soft\\"). The underpinning fact from which the theorem is established is the expandability of a holomorphic function into its Taylor series. The connectedness assumption on the domain D is necessary. For example, if D consists of two disjoint open set, f can be 0 on one open set, and 1 on another, while g is 0 on one, and 2 on another.  Lemma  If two holomorphic functions f and g on a domain D agree on a set S which has an accumulation point c in D, then f = g on a disk in D centered at c. To prove this, it is enough to show that f^{(n)}(c)= g^{(n)}(c) for all n\\\\geq 0. If this is not the case, let m be the smallest nonnegative integer with f^{(m)}(c) e g^{(m)}(c). By holomorphy, we have the following Taylor series representation in some open neighborhood U of c: : \\\\begin{align} (f - g)(z) &{}=(z - c)^m \\\\cdot \\\\left[\\\\frac{(f - g)^{(m)}(c)}{m!} + \\\\frac{(z - c) \\\\cdot (f - g)^{(m+1)}(c)}{(m+1)!} + \\\\cdots \\\\right] [6pt] &{}=(z - c)^m \\\\cdot h(z) \\\\end{align} By continuity, h is non-zero in some small open disk B around c. But then f ‚àí g ‚â† 0 on the punctured set B ‚àí {c}. This contradicts the assumption that c is an accumulation point of {f = g}. This lemma shows that for a complex number a, the fiber f‚àí1(a) is a discrete (and therefore countable) set, unless f ‚â° a.  Proof  Define the set on which f and g have the same Taylor expansion: :S = { z \\\\in D \\\\mid f^{(k)}(z) = g^{(k)}(z) \\\\text{ for all } k \\\\geq 0}=\\\\bigcap_{k=0}^\\\\infty { z \\\\in D \\\\mid (f^{(k)}- g^{(k)})(z)=0}. We'll show S is nonempty, open, and closed. Then by connectedness of D, S must be all of D, which implies f=g on S=D. By the lemma, f = g in a disk centered at c in D, they have the same Taylor series at c, so c\\\\in S, S is nonempty. As f and g are holomorphic on D, \\\\forall w\\\\in S, the Taylor series of f and g at w have non-zero radius of convergence. Therefore, the open disk B_r(w) also lies in S for some r. So S is open. By holomorphy of f and g, they have holomorphic derivatives, so all f^{(n)}, g^{(n)} are continuous. This means that {z \\\\in D \\\\mid (f^{(k)} - g^{(k)})(z) = 0} is closed for all k. S is an intersection of closed sets, so it's closed.

Born to a wealthy landholding and mining family, Kotelawala had a difficult childhood with the suicide of his father and financial difficulties that followed. He was educated at Royal College, Colombo and Christ's College, Cambridge before returning to become a planter and run the family estates and mines. Being from a politically active family, he entered active politics at the age of 35 years having been elected to the State Council of Ceylon. He later served as Minister of Communications and Works in the Second Board of Ministers of Ceylon. With Ceylon gaining independence in 1945, he was elected to Parliament and became a member of the first Cabinet as Minister of Transport and Works. Overlooked for the post of Prime Minister when the first Prime Minister of Ceylon, D. S. Senanayake died suddenly. A year later he succeeded Dudley Senanayake as the third Prime Minister of Ceylon serving until his party lost the general election in 1956. Kotelawala retired from politics thereafter. He joined the Ceylon Light Infantry as a reservist reaching the rank of Colonel; he was granted the rank of General on his deathbed. Early life and education Kotelawela's father, John Kotelawala Snr Kotelawala was born on 4 April 1895 to John Kotelawala Snr, a police inspector, who later turned businessman and Alice Elisabeth Kotalawala (n√©e Attygalle), daughter of Mudaliyar Don Charles Gemoris Attygalle, a wealthy land and mine owner. He had a younger brother Justin Kotalawela and a sister Freda, who later married C. V. S. Corea. The Kotelawalas lived in considerable comfort owing to the considerable land and mine holdings of his grandfather Mudaliyar Attygalle, which his father managed following the death of his grandfather. After he was forced out of the management of the Attygalle estates by the family, Kotelawala Snr started his own business ventures including the Ceylon-Japan Trading Company. In 1907, he was arrested and found guilty of conspiring to murder his brother-in-law, Francis Attygalle. While the murder trail was underway, Kotelawala Snr committed suicide by poisioning himself. Kotelawala was eleven years old when his father died and with this the family fortunes declined, after much funds were spent in the legal defense of his father. Alice Kotelawala who had converted to Christianity, slowly built up the family wealth through careful management of their remaining land holdings and the share of the Kahatagaha graphite mine, which she received from her younger sister Ellen and brother-in-law, Fredrick Richard Senanayake. She was reputed for her social work and was later awarded a MBE in the 1939 Birthday Honours and a CBE in the 1951 Birthday Honours.Ceylon : Young Kotelawala attended Royal College, Colombo, representing the school in cricket, tennis, boxing and football. He played in the Royal‚ÄìThomian. He had to leave owing to involvements in the riots in 1915, embarking on a tour of Europe, with World War I raging. He remained in Europe for five years, spending most of that time in England and France, attended Christ's College, Cambridge to study agriculture. Kotelawala was known as an aggressive and outspoken man who loved sports, horseback riding and cricket and, particularly as a young man, got into physical fights when he was insulted. He was fluent in Sinhala, English and French. After returning to Ceylon, he became a planter, running his family plantation estates and mines, which included the Kahatagaha Graphite Mine in Dodangaslanda. He served as a Justice of the Peace. Military service In a time when serving in the volunteer forces was prestigious and a gentlemanly pursuit, Kotelawala gained a commission as a second lieutenant in the Ceylon Light Infantry on 15 September 1922. That year the regiment received colours from the Prince of Wales. He progressed with promotions to lieutenant on 27 October 1924, captain on 23 August 1929 and major on 1 October 1933. On 1 July 1939 he was appointed second in command of the Ceylon Light Infantry and served till 1 September 1940. He was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel on 1 October 1940 and was posted to the reserve of the Ceylon Defense Force. With the outbreak of World War II in the Far East, the Ceylon Defence Force including the Ceylon Light Infantry was mobilized with the for service with the British Army. Kotelawala as the Minister of Communications and Works, became a member of the Ceylon's War Council and served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Essential Services Labor Corp. He provided his home, Kandawala to function as the officers mess for the wartime RAF station at Rathmalana. He was promoted to Colonel on 2 July 1942, the highest rank that a Ceylonese could achieve at the time and retired in 1945. Early political career Kotelawala as a member of the Board of Ministers of the Second State Council of Ceylon in 1936. As early as 1915 Kotelawala had become involved with political leaders such as Don Stephen Senanayake and his brother F.R. Senanayake, who was married to Kotelawala's mother's sister. They criticized many of the actions of the British colonial officials following the riots in 1915.  State Council  Captain John Kotelawala contested the Kurunegala seat in the 1931 election for the State Council of Ceylon. He gained 17159 votes, a majority of 9045 over his opponent from the Ceylon National Congress. Elected to the State Council, he served as a backbencher in its first term. He was reelected unopposed in the 1936 state council election from Kurunegala and was elected as Minister of Communications and Works, the chair Communications and Works Committee in the Second Board of Ministers of Ceylon. As the Minister, he oversaw the initiation of several major public works projects in the island. In Cabinet The first Cabinet of Ministers of Ceylon When Ceylon received independence and dominion status in 1948, Colonel Kotelawala contested the 1947 general elections from the United National Party (UNP) founded by D. S. Senanayake from the Dodangaslanda electorate and was elected to the newly formed House of Representatives, which was the elected lower house of parliament established under to Soulbury Constitution. Kotelawala was an important member the UNP and was appointed by Senanayake as Minister of Transport and Works, retaining the portfolio of public works which he had held in the second board of ministers. During his tenure major projects such as the Laxapana power project, expansion of the Colombo harbor, expansion of the Ratmalana Airport, construction of the University of Peradeniya and the expansion of road in the island took place. With S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike leaving the UNP and crossing over to the opposition, Kotelawala was appointed Leader of the House in the House of Representatives on 12 July 1951. Sir John Kotelawala as Minister of Transport visiting at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in 1951. When Senanayake suddenly died on 22 March 1952, Kotelawala expected to succeed him as Prime Minister, given he was the leader of the house and the most senior member of the UNP. However, to much of his anger, Lord Soulbury, the Governor-General appointed Senanayake's son and Kotelawala's younger cousin, Dudley Senanayake as Prime Minister on 26 March 1952. An angry Kotelawala threatened resignation and a possible split in the party appeared. After mediation between Kotelawala and Senanayake by senior UNP members including Sir Oliver Goonetilleke, Kotelawala agreed to serve in Dudley Senanayake's cabinet retaining his existing portfolio. Soon after Senanayake called for fresh elections and in the 1952 general elections Kotelawala was re-elected and retained his ministry and the post of leader of the house as the UNP won a majority to form a government. The following year, the Senanayake government faced a major civil unrest with left-wing parties launching the 1953 Hartal in August. On 12 August 1953 civil disobedience, strikes and demonstrations started through out the island by trade unions against the proposed elimination of the subsidy on rice by the government. The country came to standstill with transport and communication stopping due to acts of sabotage. The government implemented emergency regulations and deployed the army to suppress the Hartal and restore order. Badly shaken by the events of the Hartal, Senanayake gravely ill resigned as Prime Minister on 12 October 1953. Kotelawala succeeded Senanayake as Prime Minister; Minister of Defense and External Affairs; and leader of the UNP. Prime minister=Domestic policy His government partially retained the rice subsidy which led to the 1953 Hartal. An ardent anti-communist, he took a hardline stand against triad unions and left-wing parties. He formed the Ceylon Railway Engineer Corps and Post and Telegraph Signals to minimized the effects to transport and communication in the event of trade union action. He hosted in Ceylon Queen Elizabeth and the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh during their Royal Commonwealth Tour in April 1954, using the occasion to request the appointment of a Ceylonese Governor-General when Lord Soulbury's tenor ended. This came to be when Sir Oliver Goonetilleke was appointed Governor-General in July 1954. Kotelawala himself was appointed to the Privy Council during the visit. Foreign policy Sir John Kotelawala meeting Dutch Prime Minister Willem Drees at The Hague in 1955. As prime minister, Kotelawala led Sri Lanka into the United Nations and contributed to Sri Lanka's expanding foreign relations, particularly with other Asian countries. In 1955 he led his country's delegation to the Bandung conference in Indonesia where his performance earned him the epithet Bandung Booruwa (Bandung Donkey) in Sri Lanka, for his lack of knowledge of the presence of the US 7th Fleet in the South China Sea, and his inability to pronounce \\"Formosan\\". His uncontroversial first speech at the conference was written by journalists at the Lake House group, However, he had been influenced by the British Government, as well as by his US-aligned permanent secretary Gunasena de Soyza to make anti-Communist remarks. He made these remarks at a press conference, but subsequently withdrew them. He confessed later in Parliament that he had only made these remarks because he was pressured by de Soyza. At the conference he stated his belief that fashionably Marxist anti-colonialist rhetoric ignored Communist atrocities. In a private conversation with the prime ministers of Pakistan, India, Burma, and China, he asked Chinese premier Zhou Enlai if he wanted to bring Communism to Tibet. Zhou replied that it was impractical and undesirable, and that the PRC had gone to Tibet because it was \\"an integral part of the Chinese state\\" and because it had been threatened by \\"imperialist intrigues\\" from the British and Russian empires. Electoral defeat His government had to deal with economic problems and ethnic conflicts. Although his parliamentary term was valid till 1957, he had Parliament dissolved in 1956 calling for fresh elections. However the UNP faced a major defeat in the 1956 general elections by a group of more radically chauvinistic Sinhalese parties under the leadership of Solomon Bandaranaike. The UNP was only able to win eight seats in parliament. Final years in Parliament Kotelawala retained his parliamentary seat having been reelected from the Dodangaslanda electorate, however he returned the party leadership to Dudley Senanayake. He did not contest the 1960 general elections, instead he supported the candidacy of A. U. Romanis, his personal chauffeur, as the UNP candidate for Dodangaslanda. Romanis won both general elections in 1960 and remained a member of parliament till 1964. Later life Kotelawala retired from politics shortly after his electoral defeat. He bought the Brogues Wood estate at Biddenden in Kent, where he lived for several years. He eventually returned to Ceylon. When the post of Governor- General appeared vacant with completion of William Gopallawa's first term, he was hopeful that he would be nominated to the post by the United National Party which was in the government at the time. However Dudley Senanayake in his second term as Prime Minister did not name a successor for Gopallawa and allowed him to have a second term. Defence university Kotelawala was a strong supporter of the military and maintained close links with the army. He was the first Chairman of the Ceylon Light Infantry Association in 1974 and was the President of the Ceylon Ex Servicemen's Association from 1948 to his death. In 1978, the commanders of the armed forces identified a need to establish a Defence university to cater to the academic training of its officers. Although the government approved it, funds were limited and no location was provided by the government. In 1979, Lieutenant General Denis Perera, Commander of the Sri Lankan Army approached Kotelawala with the proposal of donating his home Kandawala and its 50 acres estate to the state to establish a Defence university. Six months later in 1980, having reviewed the proposal and consulted his heirs, Kotelawala agreed to donate Kandawala following his death. Shortly after he signed a deed of gift with the President, transferring Kandawala and a formal ceremony to establish the institution was scheduled for 11 October 1980. Death On 29 September 1980 he suffered a stroke at Kandawala and was taken to the cardiac unit of the Colombo General Hospital. On 1 October, President J. R. Jayewardene visited Kotelawala and conferred on him the honorary rank of a General of the Volunteer Force of the Army in recognition for his long service to the country, which was acknowledged by Kotelawala who was on his deathbed. The honor was planned to be awarded on 11 October at the ceremony establishing the proposed Defense Academy. He died on 2 October 1980 at the Colombo General Hospital. On 5 October, Kotelawala's coffin which was kept at Kandawala was moved to Parliament House to lay in state, before final rites at Independence Square with full military honours. Personal life He married Effie Manthri Dias Bandaranaike daughter of F. H. Dias Bandaranaike and Maria Frances Dias Bandaranaike nee Senanayake. Effie Bandaranaike was the niece of Don Stephen Senanayake. Although the marriage was not successful, ending in divorce, it produced a daughter Lakshmi Kotelawala who married Henry Gerald Kotalawala. Kotelawala was known for his flamboyance and the company he kept. He would entertain guests at his home at Kandawala and his cottage in Nuware eliya. Even as Prime Minister he resided at Kotelawala. Legacy In 1985 a national defence academy for training of officers for all three Sri Lankan defence services was established at his estate Kandawala, which he had left to the country in his will for this purpose. It has been named General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) is a defence university offering undergraduate and post graduate study courses to officers of the defence services in Sri Lanka in various disciplines. Statues of Sir John Kotelawala have been erected in many parts of the island, including one at the Old Parliament Building, Colombo. Many schools, libraries and public buildings have been named in his honor. In 1993, the Sir John Kotelawala Museum was opened at Kandawala by the President.

He is the founder and former CEO of Better Place, which had developed a model and infrastructure for employing electric cars as an alternative to fossil fuel technology. The company went bankrupt in 2013, having spent over $850 million while deploying less than 1000 cars. Prior to founding Better Place, Agassi was President of the Products and Technology Group (PTG) at SAP AG until 2007. In 2003, at the age of 36, Agassi was named one of the top 20 'Global Influentials for 2003' by CNN-Time magazine.http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1006324,00.html In 2008, he was named in one of TIME‚Äôs ‚ÄúHeroes of the Environment\\". In 2009, Agassi was included in TIME magazine's 100 most influential people list.Salzman, Alan. In 2010, Foreign Policy magazine included Agassi on its annual list of the 100 most influential global thinkers. Throughout the 90s, Agassi started and successfully sold a number of technology startups, in the areas of enterprise software, internet technology, multimedia and small business administration. Agassi has a bachelor's degree in computer science and has been awarded a large number of patents in software, automotive and energy infrastructure. Software entrepreneurship  Shai Agassi in 2006 After graduating from Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Agassi set out as a software entrepreneur. He founded TopTier Software (originally called Quicksoft Development) in Israel in 1992 and later moved the company's headquarters to California. Agassi served the company in various capacities including chairman, chief technology officer, and then CEO. He was directly involved in all critical phases of the company's development, including its strategic plan, technical direction and financing, management of two acquisitions, and negotiation of OEM agreements with companies such as SAP, Baan Corporation, and Microsoft. TopTier was a leading enterprise portal vendor when SAP acquired the company in April 2001 at a price of US$400 million. In addition to TopTier Software, Agassi co-founded several other companies with his father, Reuven Agassi, including Quicksoft Ltd., a leading multimedia software localization and distribution company in the Israeli market; TopManage, a developer of small business software that was also acquired by SAP in April 2002 (which became SAP Business One, the small business offering by SAP); and Quicksoft Media, a multimedia production company that ceased operations in 1995.  SAP executive  He wished to be the next CEO of SAP after Henning Kagermann vacated that space in 2007. However, Mr. Kagermann's contract as CEO was extended until 2009 by the supervisory board. This led Agassi to resign.Agassi, Shai. (2007-03-28) \\"New Challenges & Farewell\\", SAP Community Network At SAP he was responsible for SAP's overall technology strategy and execution. In this leadership position, he oversaw the development of the integration and application platform SAP NetWeaver, SAP xApps packaged composite applications, SAP SRM, and SAP Business One. Before his appointment to the SAP Executive Board, Agassi was CEO of SAP Portals and later of the combined company SAP Markets and SAP Portals, which previously operated as a fully owned subsidiary of SAP AG. He was appointed to the SAP Executive Board in 2002. Together with the head of the Application Platform & Architecture (AP&A;) group, Peter Zencke, Agassi co-led the Suite Architecture Team, which aligns the software architecture across all SAP solutions. Better Place In January 2008, the Israeli government announced its support for a broad effort to promote the use of electric cars, embracing a joint venture between Better Place, Renault and its partner, Nissan Motor Company. Renault and Better Place were to work on the development of electric cars which could be powered by exchangeable batteries. Agassi initially raised $200MM for this project. Investors included VantagePoint Venture Partners, Israel Corporation, Israel Cleantech Ventures, Morgan Stanley, and private investors led by Michael Granoff of Maniv Energy Capital. In 2009 he raised an additional $135 million for Better Place Denmark, including an investment from DONG Energy, the leading utility in Denmark. Following the announcement in Israel, Better Place had launched its network in Denmark, Australia and in two US locations - Hawaii and Northern California. The company said it was in talks with more than 25 countries around the world, but only in Israel and Denmark were battery swap stations built. In early 2010, Better Place raised its Series-B round at an amount of $350MM led by new investors from HSBC, Morgan Stanley, and Lazard, as well as all previous investors. In November 2011, the company raised its third equity financing round of $200 million from a group of investors including GE, UBS bank and others. Agassi was ousted as CEO of Better Place in October 2012.https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/better-place-founder-agassi- ousted-by-board-1.5173784 On 26 May 2013, Better Place filed for bankruptcy in the Israeli courts. Less than 1,400 cars were deployed in Israel, after spending about US$850 million in private capital. The bankruptcy receivers sold off the remaining assets in November 2013 for only $450,000.

He is best known for his portrayals of Necros in the 1987 Bond film The Living Daylights, Max's henchman in the 1996 film Mission: Impossible, and as one of Hans Gruber's henchmen, Tony, Die Hard, in 1988. Life and career Wisniewski was born in Berlin, Germany, to a Polish father and a German mother, and spent the early part of his life dancing before turning to acting. Wisniewski made his big-screen debut in Gothic (1986), a film about Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, in which Wisniewski plays the role of Fletcher. Probably his biggest film came the following year in 1987 Bond film The Living Daylights. The Wisniewski portrays lethal hitman Necros, who over the course of the film impersonates a Cockney milkman, an American jogger, an Austrian balloon salesman, and a doctor in Morocco. His next mainstream role was as one of Hans Gruber's (Alan Rickman) henchmen, Tony, in the 1988 film Die Hard. Wisniewski disappeared from the big screen only to reappear in the TV shows Superboy, Mann & Machine and Northern Exposure where he played Arthur, the bear. He reappeared on the big screen in the 1995 science fiction film Death Machine playing Weyland, and again in 1996 in a non-speaking role as Max's companion in another box office smash, Mission: Impossible. Wisniewski soon starred in a string of German films, after which he reappeared to UK audiences in an episode of the TV series Lock, Stock...The Series based on the gangster film by Guy Ritchie, where he played mullet-wearing Heinrich who accidentally commits suicide by shooting himself in the head playing a film game. Two years later he was in an episode of the ITV hit series Ultimate Force alongside popular soap opera star Ross Kemp playing Serbian terrorist Savo Glasnovic. Wisniewski hit the screens (although his face is never seen) in the UK again in 2008 after a six-year break when he co-starred in Mark Tonderai's cat-and- mouse thriller Hush. Wisniewski has also appeared in two music videos. He was in the video \\"Venus\\", sung by the girl group Bananarama, and also appeared as a soldier in the background of Elton John's video \\"Nikita\\", where can be seen as Elton John's Bentley Continental pulls up to the security gate. In 2001 Wisniewski turned his hand to directing, making the short film Inspiration, starring English actors Danny Webb and Christine Adams. Another Andreas Wisniewski, credited in the bio-pic Surviving Picasso alongside Anthony Hopkins, is a different actor. Wisniewski has kept a low profile since this time to spend time with his family and children and to concentrate on Buddhism. He made a rare British TV appearance in ITV's police drama The Bill. He appeared on 10 July 2008 in the episode Gun Runner: Pay and Spray, in which he played a short one-minute role as a Russian criminal 'Dimitri' purchasing guns and ammunition. Fifteen years after his first appearance in a Mission: Impossible-film, he had another non-speaking part in 2011's Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Ghost Protocol, playing the same character from the first film of the series- though working for a different employer, he and Ethan smile as they recognise each other, and he makes Ethan wear a near-identical mask as in the first movie.

Variation in grip has a major influence on the outcome of a delivery. Below is the grip for an inswing delivery. To produce the grip for an outswinging delivery, you simply have place your fingers on the other side of the seam. For a right hander you would slightly angle the seam so that it is faced towards first slip. For a pace bowler there are many variations of grip that can be adopted to produce different results. A cross-seam delivery for example is one that is used commonly in all formats of the game. when bowled a cross-seam delivery can either land on the smooth leather side of the ball and skid on possibly keeping low or zipping off the pitch. It could also land in the seam making the ball bounce up sharply and unexpectedly surprising the batsman. Overall this is a very useful grip to use, once mastered it has a place in any fast bowler's arsenal.

He set up the Wragge Museum in Stafford following a trip around the world. He was a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and in 1879 was elected Fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society in London. To the end of his life, he was interested in Theosophy and spiritualism. During his tour of India he met with Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian, the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement in Islam who had claimed to be the Mahdi, the messianic redeemer awaited by Muslims. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle sought him out in New Zealand to ask for his views on spiritualism before writing The Wanderings of a Spiritualist in 1921. After training in law, Wragge became a meteorologist, his accomplishments in the field including winning the Scottish Meteorological Society's Gold Medal and years later starting the trend of using people's names for cyclones. He travelled widely, giving lectures in London and India, and in his later years was an authority on Australia, India and the Pacific Islands. Early years thumb Wragge was originally named William, but this was changed to Clement (Lindley was the name of his great uncle). Both of his parents died when he was young: his mother at five months and his father, Clement Ingleby Wragge, at five years following a fall from his horse. He was raised for a number of years by his grandmother, Emma Wragge (formerly Ingleby) at Oakamoor, Staffordshire who taught him the rudiments of cosmology and meteorology. Emma's husband George had died in 1849 and had managed the Oakamoor works of the Cheadle Brass Wire Company before it was sold to Thomas Bolton in 1852. Wragge became an avid naturalist at a young age, being surrounded by the beauty of the Churnet valley. He was educated initially at the Church school in Oakamoor, and then his formal education was at Uttoxeter Thomas Alleyne's Grammar School. Wragge hated being a boarder at Uttoxeter and ran away, but was returned to the school where he excelled. Upon the death of his grandmother in 1865 his uncles George and William decided that he should he move to London to live with his Aunt Fanny and her family in Teddington. He was considered by his aunt to be spoilt and he rebelled against the harsh treatment. There he later boarded at the Belvedere school in Upper Norwood and at the end of his education he improved his Latin in Cornwall. He then followed in the footsteps of his father, studying law at Lincoln's Inn. He also attended St Bartholomew's Hospital alongside medical students to watch operations. Wragge travelled on the continent of Europe extensively with his Uncle William of Cheltenham. His second cousin was Clement Mansfield Ingleby, a partner in the family law firm Ingleby, Wragge, and Ingleby (which later became known as Wragge & Co of Birmingham), and later a literary scholar. At the age of 21 Wragge came into the inheritance left to him by his parents and a legacy and family silver left to him by his aunt on his mother's side of the family. He decided to take eight months break from Lincoln's Inn to visit the Egypt and the Levant. In October 1874 Wragge together with a friend Gaze Hoclen departed London on a Thomas Cook tour travelling to Paris by rail and on to Marseilles, where he sailed to Egypt on the 'Neiman'. He travelled up the Nile and took part in an archeological dig. He then toured Palestine, Jerusalem and the Holy sites, where he met a group of Mormons who interested him. He promised to visit their new city being built at Salt Lake in the American West. After much deliberation, he decided not to return to the United Kingdom with his friend and booked a passage through Cooks on the 'John Tennant' via India to Australia, then sailed from Newcastle, Sydney in late August 1875 across the Pacific to San Francisco. Once in San Francisco he travelled by rail across the wild west to Toronto via Salt Lake City. Whilst in Salt Lake City he met briefly with Brigham Young as was his right as a visitor. Later, he wrote a number of articles about Mormons and their religion. In Toronto he met with his cousin Edmund Wragge who became a famous railway engineer in Canada, South Africa and Great Britain. He returned home to Oakamoor to face his Uncle George (of Ingleby, Wragge and Ingleby solicitors) who now had Oakamoor Lodge as a country retreat from his practice in Birmingham and was very displeased with his behaviour. He made the far reaching decision that the law was not for him, and he surrendered his articles and was trained as a midshipman at Janet Taylor's Nautical Academy in London. In 1876 he sailed to Australia, working his passage to Melbourne. He was a good singer and enjoyed the sea shanties sung when hauling up the sails. He visited his Ingleby relations in Adelaide, including Rupert Ingleby QC, and obtained a position with the Surveyor-General's Department in South Australia, participating in surveys of the Flinders Ranges and Murray scrub land. He married on 13 September 1877 Leonora Edith Florence d'Eresby Thornton (her much older sister was married to Rupert Ingleby) and returned to Oakamoor, England on the 'Hesperus' in 1878 with his wife, where he went straight to his lodgings in Oakamoor. Meteorology Wragge needed experience in weather reading so he set up two weather stations weather station in North Staffordshire in 1879 at Oakamoor railway station for low level readings, and a high level station at Beacon Stoop in the Weaver Hills in North Staffs, not far from Parkhouse farm, Farley, where he moved after a time at Farley Cottage. These readings were made continually until 1883 and the results were sent to him at Ben Nevis when he was in Scotland. He became a prolific writer and was a weekly contributor in the Cheadle Herald newspaper from 1879 to 1885 and Good Words and the Midland Naturalist, who supported his work. He became a firm friend of W.H.Goss the porcelain manufacturer in Stoke-on-Trent, a fellow member of the North Staffordshire Naturalist and Archeological Field Club. During 1881 after learning of the Scottish Meteorological Society's plans to establish a weather station on Ben Nevis, Wragge offered to make daily ascents and take meteorological observations. This offer was subsequently accepted with Wragge climbing to the top of the mountain on most days between 1 June and mid October, while his wife took comparable readings near sea level at Fort William. As a result of these series of observations, Wragge was awarded the Society's Gold Medal at a meeting in March 1882. After a second series of observations were undertaken in 1882 a Summit Observatory was opened in 1883. Wragge applied for the job of Superintendent, but was unsuccessful, possibly because he had a growing family and it needed someone to spend weeks away from home. He decided to return to Australia and left taking his wife, his now famous, faithful dog 'Renzo' and his cat who caused some havoc on the voyage. Wragge's wife Leonora gave birth to a daughter, Leonora Ingleby, (later renamed Emma) in Oakamoor 1878 and Clement Lionel Egerton in 1880. His third child Rupert Lindley was born in August 1882 in Scotland. Wragge left for Australia soon after in 1883. His first male child, Clement Lionel Egerton, who was born in Farley, Staffordshire in 1880, would later enlist with the 2nd Light Horse Regiment of the First Australian Imperial Force and die from wounds at Gallipoli on 16 May 1915. Wragge in his garden at Capemba, Taringa, circa 1902 During 1884, moved to the outskirts of Adelaide, South Australia and set up a private meteorological observatory. He subsequently set up a weather station on Mount Lofty, before during 1886 he became a prime mover in the founding of the Royal Meteorological Society of Australia. His activities subsequently caught the attention of the Queensland Government, who commissioned him to write a report on the development of a meteorological organisation in Queensland that could help stem the shipping losses from cyclones. The Government was impressed with his work and on 1 January 1887 he was appointed Government Meteorologist for Queensland. Within three weeks of his arrival in Brisbane, 18.305 inches of rain fell, earning him the nickname \\"Inclement\\" Wragge. Wragge built a home, Capemba, at Taringa (now 217 Swann Road). He quickly caused disquiet amongst meteorologists and astronomers from the other Australian colonies when he started producing charts and predictions not only for Queensland, but for other areas of the continent. He further inflamed them by inscribing his reports Meteorology of Australasia, Chief Weather Bureau, Brisbane and by claiming that while he and his staff were engaged entirely in meteorological research, weather men in other colonies were government astronomers whose time was also filled with postal and telegraph duties. In the 1880s and 1890s Wragge set up an extensive network of weather stations around Queensland, and developed a series of storm signals to be used upon telegraphed instructions from Brisbane to Cape Moreton, Double Island Point, Sandy Cape, Bustard Head, Cape Capricorn, Flat Top Island, Cape Bowling Green, Cape Cleveland, Cooktown, Thursday Island and Karumba. He also set up an international service with New Caledonia, by which he received data on the newly laid cable from Noum√©a. Between 1888 and 1893, Wragge trained Inigo Owen Jones who became a renowned long-range weather forecaster. In 1895, Wragge set up a weather station near the summit of Mount Wellington, Tasmania, and 1897 established another on Mount Kosciuszko. He also attended international conferences in Munich (1891) and Paris (1898 and 1900). Wragge was also responsible for the convention of naming cyclones. His original idea was to name them after the letters of the Greek alphabet but he later used the names of figures from Polynesian mythology and politicians. Politicians to have cyclones named after them by Wragge included James Drake, Edmund Barton and Alfred Deakin. Other colourful names he used included Xerxes, Hannibal, Blasatus and Teman. After Wragge's retirement, the practice of naming cyclones would cease for sixty years. In 1898 Wragge began publishing Wragge's Australian Weather Guide and Almanac, which contained not just meteorological information, but contributions on geology, bush craft, agriculture, mining, water supplies and postal information. In an effort to break the drought of 1902 he purchased a number of Stiger Votex Cannons, which were supposedly able to bring rain from the clouds. Test firings at Charleville on 26 September were unsuccessful. Wragge was not there to see the actual experiment, having left town after an argument with the local council. Today, two of the cannons are on display in Charleville. Wragge resigned from the Queensland Government in 1903 when his funding was decreased following the Federation of Australia. Later years Wragge in his later years in the gardens at Birkenhead Wragge travelled for a number of years after finishing with the Queensland Government. In 1904 he visited the Cook Islands, New Caledonia and Tahiti to examine local fauna, and wrote a report on caterpillars and paper wasps for the government in Rarotonga. He applied unsuccessfully for the job of (Australian) Commonwealth Meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology in 1908 before returning to New Zealand. He lived for a time in Dunedin before settling at 8 Awanui Street (previously named Arawa St and prior to that Bath St), Birkenhead, Auckland with his de facto wife Louisa Emmeline (known as Edris) Horne, an Anglo-Indian theosophist. There he founded the Wragge Institute and Museum which was later partly destroyed by fire, including very sadly most of his written works and diaries, and also the well known visitor attraction ‚Äì Waiata tropical gardens. During his tour to India in 1908, Wragge met Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who had claimed to be the Promised Messiah foretold in the Bible and Islamic scriptures. The dialogues between the two are recorded in the Malf≈´zƒÅt, the discourses of Ghulam Ahmad. Some of his followers believe that Wragge had converted to Islam and stayed a Muslim until his death. Proof of his conversion is cited by Ahmadiyya Muslim scholars in the form of letters written to Mufti Muhammad Sadiq, a companion of Ghulam Ahmad, by Prof. Wragge after his meeting with Ghulam Ahmad at Lahore. However, more personal family records suggest that Wragge remained a theosophist up until his death in 1922.Wragge family papers, Auckland Institute and Museum Library Clement Wragge died on 10 December 1922 in Auckland from a stroke.

Lasca is derived from English draughts (American checkers) and the Russian draughts game Bashni (Towers). History Emanuel Lasker became familiar with the Russian version of columns draughts, called bashne, in the 19th century, while participating in chess tournaments in Moscow and St. Petersburg. According to the memoirs of contemporaries, when in Moscow, Lasker stayed in the house of D. I. Sargin, a famous historian, researcher, and popularizer of board games. By the time he met Lasker, Sargin was regularly editing columns on draughts (towers) in several Russian newspapers and magazines. The mutual influence of these famous researchers on each other is quite obvious, since Sargin is the author of the fundamental work \\"The Antiquity of the games of checkers and chess\\", and Lasker's book \\"Board games of Nations\\" was repeatedly reprinted. Public presentation of a new kind of columns draughts was at that time done by a strong marketing company using the brand in the person of Lasker, the current world champion. In 1911, factory kits for the game of Lasca, including a game board, sets of draughts of four colors and a booklet describing the rules of the game, were widely sold in Europe and the United States. –≠. –õ–∞—Å–∫–µ—Ä –∏–≥—Ä–∞–µ—Ç –≤ \\"–ª–∞—Å–∫–∞\\" (1911).jpgE.Lasker play his game Lasca. ‚Äî New game // Ogonjok : Magazin/ ‚Äî 1911. ‚Äî ‚Ññ 39. ‚Äî –°. 17. –†–µ–∫–ª–∞–º–∞ –õ–∞—Å–∫–∏ –≤ –≥–∞–∑–µ—Ç–µ.jpg Advertisement for Lasca in a paper Lasca-historisch-web.jpgOriginal set for Lasca, booklet with description of rules and box Description The game is played on a 7√ó7 board; as with draughts and most descendant games, play takes place only on alternating squares, so that only 25 of the 49 squares are actually used. The playing pieces are known initially as soldiers; when they reach the last row of the board, they become officers, with the same ability as kings in English draughts to move and jump backward. Rules The major difference between Lasca and other draughts variants is that instead of pieces being removed from the board when they are jumped, they are placed under the piece that jumped them, forming a column. A column is under the control of the player whose piece is on top, and has the move and jump capabilities of that piece (so that, for instance, a column with a black officer on top is under Black's control, and can move and jump in either direction.) If a column is itself jumped, only the top piece is removed to go under the column doing the jumping. There are a few other changes in the rules, as well. Capturing is mandatory when possible; this means that a clever player may be able to force his opponent to capture several pieces of his color, then capture his opponent's piece from the top, leaving a powerful column composed of several pieces of his own color. A player wins the game when: * the opponent has no legal move, or * all the opponent's pieces have been captured, or * the opponent resigns.

The bowling action can be broken down into a number of parts: *Grip *Approach *Bound (pre delivery stride) *Delivery stride **Back foot contact **Front foot contact *Point of release *Follow through There are certain principles that apply to all parts of the bowling action, such as balance, athleticism and keeping the movement flowing in a narrow corridor directed towards the batsman. Coaching books describe idealised bowling actions. But good coaches are well aware that many successful bowlers employ their own unique styles and some give birth to new, improved technique (for example, Bart King). The above links all describe the most commonly taught techniques. Approach The approach is the motion of the bowler prior to bowling the ball. It is also known as the run-up. A spinner's approach differs from that of a medium pace or fast bowler, but certain principles remain the same: * Balance: lack of balance in the approach translates into lack of balance in the later stages of the action and so absence of accuracy. * Consistency: a consistent approach allows the later phases of the bowling action to be consistent. Moreover, inconsistency is likely to lead to bowling no-balls. * Head still and upright. The strides of the bound, back foot contact, front foot contact and the first stride of the follow through should all be in line to give a balanced action that flows towards the target. Medium pace and quick bowlers usually employ a straight approach that is aligned toward the target. Spin bowlers, on the other hand, tend to have more varied approaches. Other recommended elements of the approach are: * Starting with shorter strides then lengthening to cruise in to the bound. * Leaning slightly forward, running on the balls of the feet. * Running with the hands pumping, tucked into the side. This tucked in run up is intended to set the pattern for the whole delivery, keeping everything in a tight corridor flowing towards the target. Some bowlers choose to sacrifice this to cover the ball with the non-bowling hand to disguise the grip. * Long enough to hit the desired cruise speed and arrive balanced at the bound. Some bowlers, especially chest on bowlers tend to run through the crease. This adds the speed of the approach to the speed at which the ball is released. In contrast, side on bowlers tend to be more similar to javelin throwers. The lower part of their body brakes between front foot contact and point of release causing a whip like effect. Hence side on bowlers tend to have slower approaches. Bound The bound is a jump that allows the bowler to transition from the run-up to the back foot contact position. For a chest on bowler not much transition is needed. So, many chest on bowlers have a low, short bound. In contrast, side on bowlers need to rotate their bodies through ninety degrees and so tend to have a longer, higher bound. A high bound can lead to the knee on the back foot collapsing and so lose momentum. Delivery stride Delivery stride is the stride during which the delivery swing is made, whether the ball is released or not. It starts when the bowler's back foot lands for that stride and ends when the front foot lands in the same stride.Laws of Cricket Appendix D Back foot contact Back foot contact is position of the bowler at the instant when the back foot lands on the ground just prior to delivering the ball. For a right-handed bowler, the back foot is normally the right foot. An alternative name for back foot contact is coil. ;Alignment To avoid back injury it is important that the hips and shoulders are aligned at back foot contact. This can be done in any of the following positions: * Side on: the back foot is parallel to the bowling crease causing the hips to be side on. The non-bowling arm is positioned in front of head so causing the shoulders to align with the hips. A classic example of a side on bowler is Dennis Lillee. * Chest on: the back foot points straight down the track towards the target, aligning the hips parallel to the bowling crease. The non bowling arm is positioned to the side of the head. This aligns the shoulders and chest parallel with the bowling crease and hips. Malcolm Marshall is an example of a chest on bowler. * Mid-way: the back foot is in between the side on and chest on position. A fine example of a mid-way bowler is Allan Donald. * If the bowler's back foot is behind parallel to the bowling crease, the bowler loses momentum and speed when delivering the ball. This is because the bowler's back foot bends at the knee and causes momentum to be lost and the bowler then has to go back and lift their whole body back upright. An action that fails to align hips and shoulders at back foot contact is termed a mixed action. ;Other coaching points * The body should be upright or just slightly leaning back. Leaning back too far causes momentum to be lost as it takes too long to transfer from back foot contact to front foot contact. * Head still and looking at the target. * Ball held close to the chin. This tucked in position allows the ball to be brought through in an arc that is aligned with the target. This is obviously important for accuracy, but is also important for power. * The non-bowling arm should also be inside or close to the line of the trunk. Traditionally the non-bowling arm is held vertically. More recent bio-mechanical theories have suggested that the non-bowling hand touching the bowling shoulder provides a shorter lever, permitting greater pace for quick bowlers. Shoaib Akhtar uses this technique. Front foot contact Front foot contact is the position of the bowler at the moment when the front foot hits the ground just prior to delivering the ball. For a right- handed bowler the front foot is normally the left foot. Point of release The point of release is the position of the ball in relation to the body at the moment when the ball is released. It is crucial for the arm to be stiff, not bent, and the wrist rather looser, to ensure smooth release of the ball, and sufficient bounce off the pitch. Otherwise, the action will resemble chucking. The left shoulder ought to be somewhat towards the stumps, the arm beside the bowler falling away, having just before this stage been pointing directly at the stumps. For fast bowlers at the point of release the back of hand will be facing in the opposite direction of the batsmen facing the pending delivery. The front of the upright wrist and tips of the index and middle fingers all point to the target. For spin bowlers the wrist may well be at various angles at release point. This is because one is trying to create drag on a particular side of the ball, not propel it straight as per the section above. Follow through James Anderson in his follow through while bowling to Michael Clarke. The follow through is the motion of the bowler after releasing the ball.

A viperfish is any species of marine fish in the genus Chauliodus. Viperfish are characterized by long, needle-like teeth and hinged lower jaws. A typical viperfish grows to lengths of . Viperfish stay near lower depths () in the daytime and shallower depths at night, primarily in tropical and temperate waters. Viperfish are believed to attack prey after luring them within range with light-producing organs called photophores, which are located along the ventral sides of its body, and with a prominent photophore at the end of a long spine in the dorsal fin reminiscent of the illicium of the unrelated deepsea anglerfishes. The viperfish flashes this natural light on and off, at the same time moving its dorsal spine around like a fishing rod and hanging completely still in the water. It also uses the light producing organ to communicate to potential mates and rivals. Viperfish vary in color from green, silver, to black. A viperfish uses its fang-like teeth to immobilize prey and would not be able to close its mouth because of their length, if it were not able to fold and curve them behind its head. The first vertebra behind the head of the viperfish absorbs the shock of biting prey. As with other deepsea fish, they are able to endure long periods with minimal food. Viperfish are believed to live from 30 to 40 years in the wild, but in captivity they rarely live more than a few hours. Some species of dolphins and sharks are known to prey upon viperfish. Scientists believe they can swim at a speed of two body lengths per second, but this is not yet an official speed. Although it may appear to be covered in scales, it is covered by a thick, transparent coating of unknown substance. Extremely large, fang-like teeth give the fish a slightly protruded lower jaw which makes catching prey easy. The viperfish is lined with three different types of photophores, which some speculate are used to lure prey. They have microscopic spheres without a pigment layer that are scattered over the dorsal side, large spheres with a pigment coat, reflectors, and lens and large, bell-shaped organs with a pigment coat, reflectors, and lens that are grouped together in rows along the dorsal surface. Photophores can also be seen along the ventral and lateral surface of the fish.  Habitat  Because viperfish live in bathypelagic environments inaccessible to humans, little is known about their habits. They are found from a depth of 1,000 to 4,000 meters with an average temperature of 4 degrees Celsius. Viperfish are thought to engage in a daily vertical migration, as they have been observed in the mesopelagic region at night, which lies directly above the bathypelagic region. More direct observation is needed to confirm this assumption.  Feeding  Viperfish do not appear to have any preferred prey. Stomach contents of captured individuals have contained lanternfish, bristlemouthes and other fish, suggesting that they attack and swallow whatever random prey they encounter. With their dark coloration, they can appear invisible and have been observed to remain motionless for hours ready to strike on unsuspecting prey.Deep Sea Creatures. ‚ÄúViperfish‚Äù 2014. Web. Prey is captured and killed by being pierced by the viperfish's long teeth, and then swallowed whole. The photophores along the viperfish's belly are thought to help lure prey, though further observation is needed to confirm this hypothesis. The first vertebra, immediately behind the head, acts as a shock absorber. The viperfish uses this light organ to attract its prey through bioluminescence. By flashing the light on and off, it can be used like a fishing lure to attract smaller fish.  Species  There are currently nine extant recognized species in this genus: * Chauliodus barbatus Garman, 1899 * Chauliodus danae Regan & Trewavas, 1929 (Dana viperfish) * Chauliodus dentatus Garman, 1899 * Chauliodus macouni T.

It was founded in 1003 on the site of a Roman fort by the future Saint Heribert, Archbishop of Cologne, close adviser of Emperor Otto III. Heribert died in 1021 and was buried in the Romanesque church he had had built here. The theologian Rupert of Deutz was abbot during the 1120s. The abbey had extensive properties, but its strategic position by the Rhine exposed it to involvement in fighting, and it was destroyed in the 14th century and again in the 16th. It was dissolved during the secularisation of the Napoleonic era, but the abbey church, now known as Alt St. Heribert, became a parish church in 1804. In World War II it was heavily damaged and only the ground floor and remnants of the Romanesque cellar were preserved. Reconstruction took place in the 1970s. Today the former abbey accommodates an old people's home run by Caritas. Notable are the mural paintings by the artist Werner Weber. The former abbey church of Alt St. Heribert is now used by the Greek Orthodox community of Cologne, and has been superseded as a Roman Catholic parish church by Neu St. Heribert, which now houses the shrine of Saint Heribert.

Kv√¶√∞i can have hundreds of stanzas plus a chorus sung between every verse. History It is generally thought that Faroese ballads, as elsewhere in Europe, began to be composed in the Middle Ages, but very little medieval Faroese writing survives, so the ballads' medieval history is obscure. The subject matter of Faroese ballads varies widely, including heroic narratives set in the distant past, contemporary politics, and comic tales. The most archaic-looking layer, however, is the heroic narratives. It was once thought that these derive independently from Viking-Age oral narratives, and this may be true of a few, but it has since been shown that most derive directly from written Icelandic sagas or occasionally r√≠mur. The traceable origins of Faroese balladry, then, seem to lie between the fourteenth century (when the relevant Icelandic sagas tended to be composed) and the seventeenth (when contacts with Iceland diminished).For a general introduction, see Michael Chesnutt, 'Aspects of the Faroese Traditional Ballad in the Nineteenth Century', in The Stockholm Ballad Conference 1991: Proceedings of the 21st International Ballad Conference, August 19‚Äì22, 1991, ed.

Faroese ballads began to be collected by Jens Christian Svabo in 1781‚Äì1782, though Svabo's collection was not published in his lifetime; the most prominent of Svabo's successors was Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb. The Danish historians Svend Grundtvig and J√∏rgen Bloch began the process of a complete, standard edition of the ballads, which eventually gave rise to the F√∏roya kv√¶√∞i/Corpus Carminum F√¶roensium, published between 1941 and 2003.F√∏roya kv√¶√∞i = Corpus carminum F√¶roensium, Sv.

In the last volume, Marianne Clausen presented a large collection of music transcriptions of kv√¶√∞i melodies, based on sound recordings.

It is loosely based on the life of Joey Coyle, who, in 1981, discovered $1.2 million that had fallen out of an armored van in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The film depicts Coyle's struggles with keeping the money over a five-day period. It stars John Cusack in the leading role, with a supporting cast that includes Michael Madsen, Debi Mazar, Benicio del Toro, Maury Chaykin, Michael Rapaport, James Gandolfini, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Fionnula Flanagan. The film is based on \\"Finders Keepers\\", a three-part series of articles written by Mark Bowden for The Philadelphia Inquirer that detailed Coyle's real-life experiences. After an unsuccessful pre-production in December 1983, the film's executive producers Gordon Freedman and Matt Tolmach acquired the rights to Coyle's story in 1990, and the project continued development at The Walt Disney Studios with Men√©ndez attached to direct. The film was shot on locations in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with principal photography beginning in February 1993 and concluding after eight weeks. Coyle, who acted a consultant on the film, died by suicide on August 15, 1993, three weeks before the film's theatrical release. In response, Disney chose to quietly release the film, under its adult film banner Hollywood Pictures, on September 10. The film received mostly negative reviews from critics, and grossed more than $1 million against an estimated production budget of $11 million. Plot On a Friday morning in Philadelphia, a cart containing $1.2 million in $100 unmarked bills falls out of an armored van as it leaves the Federal Reserve Bank. Joey Coyle (John Cusack), a struggling longshoreman, finds the cart laying on the side of a road, and decides to keep the bags of money. Joey reveals the discovery to his friend Kenny Kozlowski (Michael Rapaport), who is driving his father's car. After Kenny refuses to be incriminated, Joey decides to keep the money for himself. Upon returning home, he stashes a large portion of the money in his closet, and tries to keep it a secret from his mother (Fionnula Flanagan), siblings Billy (James Gandolfini) and Eleanor (Elizabeth Bracco) and niece Katie (Ashleigh Dejon). After he decides to investigate, South Philadelphia Police Detective Pat Laurenzi (Michael Madsen) discovers that the armored truck‚Äôs faulty latch is to blame for the money falling out of the vehicle. News reports of the money's disappearance attract significant attention among local residents. That night, Joey meets with his former girlfriend, investment banker Monica Russo (Debi Mazar), asking how he can make a large deposit without attracting the attention of the Internal Revenue Service. Monica initially scoffs at the notion that he would have a large sum of cash laying around, but ultimately deduces that he found the money that was reported missing. Joey then goes to his favorite bar and buys rounds of drinks for its patrons, claiming to have won earnings from a horse racing bet. He confides the truth to Dino Palladino (Benicio Del Toro), a bookmaker who agrees to help launder the money. Although he is unable to comprehend how the laundering scheme works, Joey agrees to the terms proposed by Dino's boss Vincente Goldoni (Maury Chaykin). The following Saturday, Laurenzi finds a homeless boy who reveals that he saw someone take the money and identifies the make and model of the car belonging to Kenny's father. At the bar, some of the patrons begin to question how Joey got the money, and their suspicions are heightened when Laurenzi walks in and asks questions. Worried that the detective will discover the car Kenny was driving, Joey drives the vehicle into a river. Fearful of his family snooping around the house, he attempts to hide the remainder of the money in an attic, but falls through the ceiling. When his mother and siblings realize what has happened, Joey offers to share the money with them, but they strongly object to keeping something that is not rightfully theirs. The next day, Joey brings the money to Monica‚Äôs office and dumps it in her desk, requesting that they meet again later that night. He then goes to Goldoni‚Äôs office with a gun and forces Dino to give him back his first batch of cash, but is furious when he discovers that Goldoni has changed the money into nickels and quarters. After recovering the car from the river, Laurenzi confronts Kenny, who confirms that Joey found the money. On Monday afternoon, Joey returns to the bar and watches a news report identifying him as the thief. The other patrons label him as a hero and vow to protect his identity, much to the frustration of Billy. Dino attempts to shoot and kill Joey in the bar's restroom, but is subdued by Billy, who then urges his brother to leave town. Monica arrives with the remainder of the money and airline tickets to the Bahamas. The two spend a night at a hotel where Monica bleaches Joey‚Äôs hair and counts the cash obsessively. At the bar, Dino is confronted by Laurenzi, and to avoid being implicated, he arranges for the detective to have the money that Joey tried to launder returned without question. The following morning, Joey and Monica go the airport and are unknowingly pursued by Laurenzi, who searches the terminals. After being informed that his suitcase containing the cash is too big to carry onboard the plane, Joey purchases a pair of pantyhose from a gift shop and stuffs the money down his pants. Once through the security checkpoint, he goes to a restroom and transfers the money into a small duffel bag. As he and Monica attempt to board the plane, Laurenzi notices them standing in line and raises his gun. Joey attempts to flee, but he and Monica are quickly surrounded by other police officers and arrested. An epilogue reveals that the armored car company recovered all but roughly $196,000 of the stolen money. Joey was charged with theft, conspiracy and receiving stolen property, but was acquitted of all charges by reason of temporary insanity. Cast In addition, Joey Coyle makes an uncredited appearance as a dockworker in the film's opening scene. The film is dedicated to Coyle, who died on August 15, 1993. Historical context On February 26, 1981 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Joey Coyle, an unemployed longshoreman, had been travelling with his friends John Behlau and Jed Pennock, when he discovered two white bags reading \\"Federal Reserve Bank\\" on the side of a road outside Purolator Armored Services. Both bags had fallen from one of Purolator's armored vans, and contained a total of $1.2 million in $100 bills that had come from casino earnings. That night, Philadelphia Police Detective Pat Laurenzi, began a neighborhood search after two eyewitnesses reported the make and model of the vehicle that Behlau was driving, a 1971 Chevrolet Malibu, and a person with their hands full entering the vehicle before it drove off. The FBI was later brought in to aid the investigation. Coyle, a drug addict, spent most of the money on methamphetamine and gave away portions of the cash to family, friends and strangers. He later met with another friend, Carl Masi, who learned from a radio scanner that police had issued a search for Belhau's car. After abandoning the vehicle in Gloucester City, New Jersey, Masi warned Coyle to turn the money in to police. Coyle refused, and days later he met Masi's friend Mario ‚ÄúSonny‚Äù Riccobene, a person with suspected mafia connections who instructed him on how to properly handle the money. Coyle gave Riccobene $400,000, hoping the latter would have $100 bills laundered down to smaller denominations by playing at a casino. After more than 500 tips from eyewitnesses, Laurenzi received a police report of Behlau's car in Gloucester City. Belhau and Pennock later turned themselves in to the police, both revealing that they and Coyle had found the money. On March 3, 1981, Coyle decided to leave town, fearing that he would be caught by police, or that the mob would come to collect the remainder of the money. He turned to another friend, Francis A. Santos, who bought him a plane ticket and spent the night with him in New York City. A day later, Coyle and Santos were arrested by FBI agents at the John F. Kennedy International Airport. At the time of his arrest, Coyle was attempting to check in for a flight to Acapulco, Mexico. He was carrying $105,000 in 21 envelopes (each containing $5,000) that were stuffed inside a pair of cowboy boots he was wearing. Roughly $1,003,400 of the missing money was recovered. Belhau and Pennock were not charged. Coyle was charged with theft, conspiracy and receiving stolen property, and was facing up to seven years in prison. His lawyer argued that his actions upon discovering the money were motivated by insanity and not greed. In February 1982, a jury found Coyle innocent by reason of temporary insanity. On August 15, 1993, Coyle was found dead by suicide in his Philadelphia home, his body hanged by an electrical cord. He had recently received a sixth drug conviction and was to be sentenced the following September. While the film is based on actual events, some historical inaccuracies have been noted. The film omits Coyle's drug addiction, and many of its supporting characters are composites of actual people. The film is based on \\"Finders Keepers\\", a three-part series of articles written by Mark Bowden for The Philadelphia Inquirer. Bowden later adapted the articles into a 2002 book titled Finders Keepers: The Story of a Man who Found $1 Million. Production=Development Interesting in adapting Joey Coyle's story to film originated in December 1983, when a New York-based production company known as The Film Writers Company expressed interest in producing a film detailing his discovery of the money. Screenwriters Mark Kram and story editor David Loucka were scheduled to meet with Coyle, and tour South Philadelphia during pre-production. Coyle signed a contract with the production company in which he would receive an estimated $100,000, plus a percentage of the film's profits, but development plans ultimately fell through. The film's executive producers Gordon Freedman and Matt Tolmach spent three years trying to acquire the film rights to Coyle's experiences. They met Coyle's lawyer Harold Kane, who informed them that the rights had been optioned. Freedman and Tolmach secured the rights in 1990, after bidding against another competitor. Director Ram√≥n Men√©ndez and producer Tom Musca joined the project shortly thereafter. Both are credited with co- writing the screenplay with Carol Sobieski; Sobieski, who died on November 4, 1990, was given a posthumous credit. The film continued development at The Walt Disney Studios under the working title Found Money. The studio also acquired the rights to \\"Finders Keepers\\", a 1986 three-part series of articles written by Mark Bowden for The Philadelphia Inquirer. Disney allocated a production budget of $11 million, and paid Coyle $70,000 to act as a consultant alongside Bowden. During pre-production, Men√©ndez and Musca traveled to Philadelphia and interviewed various people related to Coyle. The director stated that he wanted the story to illustrate \\"what it means for a kid like that to find money.\\" The filmmakers chose to omit Coyle's drug addiction and bouts with depression, and many characters were composites of actual people. In conceiving wardrobe ideas for the film, costume designer Zeca Seabra met with Coyle, his friends and Pat Laurenzi, the police detective who investigated the stolen money. To prepare for the role, John Cusack befriended Coyle in the fall of the 1992. Filming Principal photography began on February 1, 1993. The opening scene was shot on location on Pier 80 in the Port of Philadelphia. Due to budget restraints, the remainder of filming took place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Scenes set in Joey's neighborhood were shot in Lawrenceville. St. Kieran‚Äôs Catholic School doubled for interior scenes set in the South Philadelphia Police Department, while PNC Financial Services served as Monica‚Äôs investment office, with the company's employees appearing as extras. The scene in which Joey finds the money was filmed in Duquesne, Pennsylvania at the Duquesne Steel Works, an inoperative steel mill. Principal photography concluded after eight weeks of filming. Release Coyle died by suicide on August 15, 1993, three weeks before the film's theatrical release. In response, Menendez and producer Tom Musca traveled to Philadelphia to console Coyle's family and friends and discuss making an appropiate tribute for the film. Disney chose to quietly release the film with little marketing and promotion under its adult film label Hollywood Pictures. Money for Nothing was released on September 10, 1993, to 449 theaters. After 113 days (16 weeks) of release, the film grossed $1,039,824 in the United States and Canada, failing to recoup its $11 million budget. Home video Buena Vista Home Entertainment released the film on DVD on November 11, 2003, under its Hollywood Pictures Home Video banner. A Blu-ray disc version was released on May 10, 2011, by Mill Creek Entertainment. Mill Creek also released it on DVD, as part of a \\"Triple Feature\\" bundle pack with two other comedies, Disorganized Crime (1989) and Another Stakeout (1993). On June 4, 2019, Kino Lorber Corporation re-released the film on Blu-ray. Reception=Critical response Upon release, the film received mostly negative reviews from mainstream critics. Online reviewer James Berardinelli wrote, \\"There's nothing horrible about Money for Nothing. It has a story to tell, and it accomplishes that aim, albeit in a workmanlike fashion. However, with everything being so straightforward and unremarkable, I can't say it's worth the time or money.\\" Megan Rosenfeld of The Washington Post felt that the film \\"gets close to being a deft modern fable but flirts with cheap comedy too often ... \\" Brian Lowry of Variety felt that the filmmakers \\"never bring much life to this production, in part because Joey‚Äôs efforts are so inept and misguided from the get-go.\\" John Petrakis of the Chicago Tribune praised Cusack's \\"excellent performance\\", but concluded, \\" ... Money for Nothing might have been another Melvin and Howard. But in a short-sighted attempt to hedge their bet, [the filmmakers] water down their main character, which dilutes their story, weakening their film. And that, as they say, is just too bad.\\" Glenn Kenny of Entertainment Weekly described Cusack's portrayal of Coyle as being \\"so utterly dense that Money for Nothing is literally painful to watch ‚Äî even in the privacy of one‚Äôs home ‚Äî whenever he‚Äôs on screen.\\" Eli Kooris of The Austin Chronicle, wrote, \\" ... while the stellar cast keeps the film from being a complete failure, the slow story and convoluted tone leave the viewer all but broke in the end.\\" One positive review came from the Sun-Sentinel's Candice Russell, who wrote, \\"Based on a true story, the drama is laced with hilarious highs of humor. At its core, however, is a hard sense of realism that is to be applauded. The filmmakers never take the easy way out.\\" Another review by Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times praised Cusack's performance, and noted that the film \\"further confirms [Cusack]'s versatility. He plays a working-class Irish-American as if he were born and bred in South Philly and, most important, suggests that Joey is foolish and unlucky rather than simply stupid and greedy.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:1993 films Category:American crime comedy films Category:American films Category:Hollywood Pictures films Category:Fictional portrayals of the Philadelphia Police Department Category:Films based on newspaper and magazine articles Category:Films directed by Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Category:Films scored by Craig Safan Category:Films set in Philadelphia Category:Films shot in Pennsylvania Category:Crime films based on actual events Category:1990s crime comedy films Category:1993 comedy films ","title":"Money for Nothing (1993 film)"},{"id":"3553918","text":"Johor FM is a Johor-state Malay language radio station operated by Radio Televisyen Malaysia out of the Johor state capital Johor Bahru in Malaysia.

In Canada, the federal Minister of Transport selects the local chief executive board member and the rest of the board is appointed at the recommendation of port users to the federal Minister; while all Canadian port authorities have a federal or Crown charter called Letters Patent. Numerous Caribbean nations have port authorities, including those of Aruba, British Virgin Islands, Bahamas, Jamaica, Cayman Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, St. Lucia, St. Maarten, St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Central and South America also have port agencies such as autoridad and consorcio (authority and consortium). In Mexico, the federal government created sixteen port administrations in 1994‚Äì1995 called Administraci√≥n Portuaria Integral (API) in Spanish, as result of the Lay de Puertos of 1993. These are organized as variable capital corporations (Sociedad An√≥nima de Capital Variable or S.A. de C.V.), with the intent of creating more private investment in a state owned sector. Port authorities are usually governed by boards or commissions, which are commonly appointed by governmental chief executives, often from different jurisdictions. Most port authorities are financially self-supporting. In addition to owning land, setting fees, and sometimes levying taxes, port districts can also operate shipping terminals, airports, railroads, and irrigation facilities.  Port authorities and districts  The distinction between inland and being marine is occasionally open to discussion. No distinction is made here between river and Great Lakes ports.

It consisted of two commuter railway lines to promote and service new suburban neighbourhoods outside of the then city limits. Both lines were laid as loops. The longer Don Loop ran north of the city limits, and the shorter Humber Loop ran west of the city limits. The railway was never profitable and it only ran for two years. Today, as part of a rails-to-trail project, the Beltline Trail lies on the right-of-way of the Don Loop. Routes The railway consisted of two separate loops both starting and ending at Union Station. The larger Don loop went east on the tracks of the Grand Trunk Railway via The Esplanade to the Don River. It then turned north following the river passing the Don Valley Brick Works on its west side before journeying up a steep grade through the Moore Park Ravine (called \\"Spring Valley\\" in Belt Line brochures). It then turned west at the north edge of the Mount Pleasant Cemetery along Merton St. At Yonge Street it turned northwest travelling through Forest Hill until just north of Eglinton Avenue West. There, it turned west again before returning to Union Station via the Grand Trunk Railway (today's Barrie line) line west of Caledonia Road. A complete trip around the Don Loop was approximately . A second, smaller Humber loop headed west along the northwest rail corridor of the Grand Trunk Railway through Parkdale. It turned west just north of St. Clair Avenue and then turned south at Lambton Mills, just east of the Humber River. It ran south following the edge of the Humber River valley. It followed a route paralleled by the South Kingsway just west of High Park. It returned east along Lake Ontario via the tracks of the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway. A complete trip around the Humber Loop from and returning to Union Station was approximately . According to Lyman B. Jackes, there was a spur line north of St. Clair Avenue to link the two loops so that Belt Line trains could operate from one loop to the other. However, according to R.L.Kennedy, such a connection was proposed but never built. History Entrepreneur James David Edgar lead a group of investors to develop suburban land and build a railway to service these proposed suburban residential developments. The company would promote properties in Moore Park, Forest Hill, Fairbank and Fairbank Junction, areas along the Belt Line. As a result of a booming real estate market in the late 1880s, two related companies were founded. The Toronto Belt Land Corporation was incorporated on July 16, 1889 to subdivide and sell land in the new suburbs, and the Toronto Belt Line Railway Company was founded on March 23, 1889 to build a commuter railway to connect these new suburban areas to the city. A pamphlet by the Toronto Belt Land Corporation described the railway's mission as: \\"to economize time by rapid transit, and to carry men, women and children with comfort, safety and speed beyond the cramped and crowded city to the airy uplands; whence having enjoyed the rest and refreshment of commodious homes and spacious grounds, they can return on the morrow to renew, with quickened energies, the task of life.\\" The railway was to support a suburban lifestyle. The cost of railway construction was $462,000, much higher than investors had expected. There were also lawsuits over land acquisitions and difficult negotiations with the City over access through the Don Valley. The real estate boom busted before the railway could be completed resulting in bankruptcy for the company. The Belt Line was then taken over by the Grand Trunk Railway. By 1891, 90 workers were building the Don Loop east of Yonge Street, and 140 workers to the west. Passenger service first began on July 30, 1892, under the full control of the Grand Trunk Railway. Six trains per day (reduced to three per day in July 1894) were operated in both directions on each of the two loops. The heaviest usage was excursion travel on Sundays. The line used five 4-4-2 tank steam locomotives built at the GTR's Point St. Charles shops. According to an August 1892 article in the Toronto Mail, the passenger coaches resembled an improved version of those used on the New York elevated railway at that time. The railway ceased on November 17, 1894 after 870 days of passenger service. The railway never made a profit. There were a number of reasons for this - the fare prices were too high at the time (5 cents per station, with every additional station adding 5 more cents, to a maximum fare of 25 cents), there was insufficient population and ridership, and the country was experiencing a financial depression in the 1890s. The success of the enterprise depended on the rapid development of suburban properties, and a monopoly of transportation service to the developing areas. The drive to develop these new communities was blunted by the depression of 1893, and it took longer to open up the new neighbourhoods than the developers had hoped. Also, electric streetcars of the Toronto Railway Company along with radial railways such as the Metropolitan Street Railway were providing more direct routes to downtown. Shortly after passenger trains stopped operating, parts of the Don Loop sat unused for several years. In 1906, the relatively short section in the Don Valley south of Winchester St. (across from Riverdale Park) was used as part of a new line by the Canadian Northern Railway connecting Toronto to Parry Sound. In 1910, the Grand Trunk Railway rebuilt the portion of the Don Loop between Fairbank Junction and Mount Pleasant Road for freight service. This was to support the delivery of fuel and building supplies by rail for use in residential areas neighbouring the eastern end of the spur. The tracks on the steep grade (4%) in the Moore Park Ravine were pulled up during World War I due to a shortage of iron. A 1921 engineering report said that few sections of the Humber Loop had good track in place. Wooden bridges had deteriorated. Adjacent home-owners had extended their back yards onto the right-of-way. There were municipal seizures due to defaulting on tax payments. The Grand Trunk Railway went bankrupt in 1923 and became part of Canadian National Railways. The Belt Line was eventually sold on December 31, 1943 to Canadian National Railway (CNR) for $410,000 CAD. Three of the five 4-4-2T commuter tank locomotives specially built for the Belt Line were eventually used on the Thousand Islands Railway in Gananoque, Ontario.Douglas N W, Smith, \\"By Rail, Road and Water to Gananoque\\", Pictures: Pages72, 104. Trackside Canada, 1995 Part of the right-of-way of the Humber Loop was used by the Toronto Suburban Railway between 1925 and 1931. Canadian National Railway used part of the Humber Loop, which became the Lambton Spur, to service local industries until about 1960-1970, with the final segment from Weston Road to Symes Road closing on February 26, 1980. In the 1950s the TTC subway yard at Davisville opened at Yonge St. The Belt Line spur was used to deliver new subway cars on flat cars to the upper Davisville Yard until the Greenwood Yard opened in 1965. The service east of Yonge Street bridge was terminated in the 1960s when that bridge was closed. The last commercial organization to use the spur east of Yonge Street was Dominion Coal whose coal silos were built in 1928. The switch connecting the spur to the unloading siding was removed when the Mount Pleasant bridge over the Belt Line was rebuilt in 1976. The silos were demolished in 2001. Part of the right-of-way of the Don Loop was expropriated to build the Spadina Expressway, which terminated freight service east of Allen Road to Yonge Street in 1970. This split the remaining spur close to its origin at Caledonia, which was used to service light industry in the Caledonia Road area until about 1988. In the 1970s, CNR tried to sell the right-of-way of the former Don Loop for housing since the land was quite valuable. Most home owners adjacent to the line wished to buy the land to extend their backyards. A local citizen, Esther Carin, successfully lobbied city council to turn the section east of Allen Road into a walking trail. The land was purchased by the city in 1972 as part of a land swap with CN that included the Metro Toronto Convention Centre on Front Street. Later, a trail on the west side of the Allen would be established as well. Today, the Beltline Trail is a 9 km walking and cycling trail. Stations All the stations listed below were used by the Belt Line, but those marked \\"(TBL)\\" (and perhaps a few others along other GTR lines) were used exclusively by Belt Line trains. The stations built for Belt Line passengers were of a standard design with two variations - large and small size. The station size, where known is indicated. None of the stations exists today.

This important role earned it the title of Crossroads of the American Revolution. Not all of the population of New Jersey advocated independence; Governor William Franklin, the illegitimate son of Benjamin Franklin, was a loyalist who supported the Stamp Act. Many of the colonists had emigrated from England and felt a sense of loyalty to the King of England and the English government. On January 8, 1776, Governor Franklin was arrested for opposing the Revolution. Others such as slaves joined sides with the British in return for promises of freedom. For example, Colonel Tye was a slave who escaped and joined the British army, leading constant raids against the people of New Jersey.Streissguth, Thomas (2002). New Jersey. San Diego: Lucent Books, Inc. . Throughout the Revolutionary War, there were many clashes between the Americans and British within the colony of New Jersey. In total, there were 296 engagements that occurred within New Jersey, more clashes than occurred in any other colony during the war. Prewar tensions Following the French and Indian War, tensions erupted between the Americans and the British, in part, over who should pay for the war that resulted in the immense territorial gains for the British with their conquest of Quebec and French Canada. After Parliament issued the Sugar Act, the Stamp Act, and the Tea Act, furious protests and outbreaks occurred. One such outbreak occurred in Greenwich Township, New Jersey in Cumberland County. On December 22, 1774, a group of 40 colonists entered the cellar of loyalist Daniel Bowen and quickly stole and burned chests of tea. Declaration of Independence New Jersey representatives Richard Stockton, John Witherspoon, Francis Hopkinson, John Hart, and Abraham Clark were among the men who signed the United States Declaration of Independence. These men, just like all the others, took tremendous risks in order to fight for independence and all went on to serve their newly founded country for the rest of their lives. Distinguished lawyer Richard Stockton, New Jersey-born and College of New Jersey graduate, sacrificed his royal judicial title and his considerable international economic interest in order to be an elected delegate for New Jersey at the General Congress. John Witherspoon was a Scottish immigrant. He came to New Jersey to serve as the sixth president of the College of New Jersey. He was a world-renowned Presbyterian minister and became a leading member of the Continental Congress. Witherspoon went on to become one of the leaders of the new national Presbyterian church. Francis Hopkinson was somewhat of a renaissance man for his time. He was articulate in several fields of the arts and a very impressive scientist. Perhaps the capstone of his career was his appointment by President George Washington to the federal bench. John Hart was a prominent landowner and judge of the Hunterdon County court. Like Stockton, he sacrificed his high standing with the royal court and dedicated his life to the New Jersey Assembly. After signing the Declaration of Independence, he went on to become the speaker of the New Jersey Assembly. The last of the men, Abraham Clark, was native to Elizabethtown. He was slightly different from his fellow New Jersey representatives as he jumped from job to job working as a farmer, surveyor, transporter, legal adviser, and finally politician. He was well liked in all these fields and had become a prominent member of society, but he found his home in government. He held numerous political positions at all the various levels of government. Battles Besides being the location of several important battles, New Jersey was also helpful in disrupting British supply units. Forts on the Delaware River could attack British supply troops as they sailed to Philadelphia. Men in whaleboats crossed the Hudson and raided New York City and Long Island, and captured shipping in the Sandy Hook staging area outside New York Harbor. Ships based in south Jersey ports raided British shipping at sea. New Jersey also had several ironworks that provide iron and iron products, such as cannon, for the war effort, besides its food production. The Ford family in Morristown ran a black powder mill that supplied needed powder for the early war effort. The Continental army encamped three years in New Jersey, in the winters of 1777 at Morristown, 1778‚Äì79 at Middlebrook (near Bound Brook), and in 1780 again at Morristown. Large parts of the Continental forces wintered in other years in NJ. Raids from British-held New York City from across the Hudson into New Jersey happened very frequently. The British sent men into New Jersey looking for supplies, firewood, cattle, horses, sheep and pigs, and looking to capture leading patriots. Battle of Fort Lee Thomas Davies of the British invasion at the Palisades on the morning of November 20, 1776, near Fort Lee, New Jersey. The war did not start well for the Continental Army. After difficult losses in the Battle of Brooklyn, General George Washington led his troops towards Manhattan with the British in pursuit. On November 16, 1776, Fort Washington, at the northern tip of Manhattan Island, fell to the British. On the morning of November 20, 1776, British soldiers under Charles Cornwallis captured Fort Lee after a hasty retreat by the American soldiers stationed there under the command of General Nathanael Greene. After gaining control of the Manhattan area, the British ferried up the Hudson River in barges. Washington had dashed off to warn the Americans about the advancing British, and the fort was evacuated. Much equipment and supplies were captured by the British. Washington then led his 2,000 troops from Fort Lee in a retreat through present-day Englewood and Teaneck across the Hackensack River at New Bridge Landing. Washington continued his retreat through early December, passing through Princeton on the way to the Delaware River. Ten Crucial Days Military map by William Faden with troop movements during the Ten Crucial Days The \\"Ten Crucial Days\\" were the days from December 25, 1776 to January 3, 1777, when several decisive battles, namely the battles of Trenton, Assunpink Creek and Princeton, were fought between the Continental Army under George Washington and the British army, mostly under Charles Cornwallis. Washington badly needed a victory to prove his army's hope of winning and thus boost morale. It is considered is one of the most significant military offensives in history. According to George Otto Trevelyan: \\"It may be doubted whether so small a number of men ever employed so short a space of time with greater and more lasting effects upon the history of the world.\\" Frederick the Great called them ‚Äúthe most brilliant in the world‚Äôs history.‚Äù President Coolidge called them ‚Äúa military exploit of unparalleled brilliancy.\\" Battle of Trenton The Capture of the Hessians at Trenton, December 26, 1776 by John Trumbull On the night of December 25‚Äì26, 1776, the Continental Army under the command of General George Washington made their crossing of the Delaware River. They took the Hessians stationed in Trenton by surprise; the Hessians were not prepared for an attack during a bad storm. In the ensuing Battle of Trenton in the morning of December 26, the Continental Army defeated the Hessians. The Americans attacked in groups, one down the two main streets from the North east, the other along the river road. The American cannons denied the Hessians the ability to form up in the streets. The Hessians unsuccessfully attempted to retreat and were completely surrounded by the Continental Army. As a result of the battle, the Americans captured nearly 900 Hessian soldiers within 90 minutes. In addition, they took the supplies that had been placed in Trenton for use by the British army. Washington then had the soldiers recross safely back into Pennsylvania. The battle helped to increase the waning confidence of the Continental Congress. Battle of the Assunpink Creek On January 2, 1777, Cornwallis had hoped to engage Washington's army at Trenton after George Washington recrossed the Delaware River, resulting in the Battle of the Assunpink Creek, also known as the Second Battle of Trenton. Cornwallis's initial results were failures. After recapturing Trenton, he ordered charges on defenses fortified by Washington at Assunpink Creek. The Americans, from their defenses, fired volleys at the advancing troops, striking heavy casualties in the British army. Later that night, Washington moved the majority of his army on a surprise attack upon British troops stationed at Princeton. At the same time, he left a few troops to stall Cornwallis by creating false signals (campfires, loud noises, fortification repair) to give the impression that the Continental Army was still stationed in Trenton. Battle of Princeton The Death of General Mercer at the Battle of Princeton, January 3, 1777 by John Trumbull On January 3, 1777, the Continental Army commanded by Washington defeated the British army under Cornwallis at the Battle of Princeton. The initial contact at Princeton was between General Hugh Mercer's advance corp moving toward the Stoney Brook along Quaker Bridge road, against British Col. Charles Mawhood, who was leading most of the 55th regiment and other additional troops toward Trenton. As Mawhood crossed the Stoney Brook, both sides spotted the other. Both sides moved to a nearby hill above the Princeton Road (now 206). Mawhood opened fire as the Americans came over the ridge, and followed with a bayonet charge. Mercer's men, armed mostly with rifles, were driven off, and Mercer was wounded by bayonets (he died several days later). More American militia moved up to engage Mercer, while another column led by General Sullivan moved on the town from the south. The advancing Militia were also repelled by Mawhood's regiment, although Mawhood was outnumbered 3 or 4 to one, but he and his men stood steadfast. Washington himself lead up more Continentals and encouraged the militia to return to the fight. After a few volleys Mawhood was forced to retreat across the Stoney Brook. After driving in a detachment of the 55th regiment, Sullivan marched into Princeton. Most of the remaining British forces retreated toward New Brunswick but some took up a defensive position in the stone university building, Nassau Hall. The Americans set up cannons facing Nassau Hall of Princeton University, and two cannonballs made contact with the walls of the hall. The British soldiers at Princeton were soon forced to surrender to the Americans, and Nassau Hall was recaptured. Cornwallis immediately moved to bring his army to engage Washington. This attempt failed due to a delaying force which damaged the Stoney Point Bridge and delayed the British. These two victories, and the resulting resurgence of the militias from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New York and Connecticut, forced the British out of most of New Jersey, boosting the morale of the Americans. The British were soon forced into an enclave around New Brunswick, giving up the rest of New Jersey.\\"Valis, Glenn. The Battle of Princeton, accessed September 20, 2006 The attempt of the British went to show the Americans that they could not fight. The British army had failed. The British now realized it would be a long war. Battle of Millstone Also known as the battle of Van Nest's Mills, the Battle of Millstone occurred on January 20, 1777. Following the battle of Princeton, Washington's soldiers traveled north following the Millstone River to Somerset Court House (now Millstone, New Jersey), then proceeded to Morristown. From New Brunswick, a British foraging party of a few hundred men also went to Somerset Court House, reaching Van Nest‚Äôs Mill (present day Manville, New Jersey). After seizing flour and livestock, the British unit set up defenses on the Millstone River, including 3 cannons. The militia posted in the area managed to surprise the British party by crossing the cold, waist deep, river and capture many men and to seize back the supplies. General Dickinson Raritan, New Jersey, January 23: \\"I have the pleasure to inform you that on Monday last with about 450 men chiefly our militia I attacked a foraging party near V. Nest Mills consisting of 500 men with 2 field pieces, which we routed after an engagement of 20 minutes and brought off 107 horses, 49 wagons, 115 cattle, 70 sheep, 40 barrels of flour - 106 bags and many other things, 49 prisoners.\\"Valis, Glenn. The Battle of Millstone, accessed March 12, 2006. Battle of Bound Brook The Battle of Bound Brook resulted in a shallow defeat of the Americans stationed at Bound Brook, New Jersey on April 13, 1777. A four-prong attack by 4,000 British upon Bound Brook ensued, and the Americans, who put up a fierce resistance at first, retreated. Around 60 casualties occurred on the American side, while only a single British soldier was killed. On the same day, Nathanael Greene recaptured Bound Brook, but George Washington realized the difficulty of defending the place. Battle of Short Hills After advancing to Millstone, New Jersey, on June 26, 1777, General Howe found that Washington would not move his army out of the strong position on the Watchung Mountains north of Middlebrook. Planning to attack Philadelphia, but unable to go safely through New Jersey with its militia nipping away at his men, he had to move his men back to New Brunswick to board shipping. As the British forces moved back, Washington had some generals move forward, looking for an opportunity to attack a weakened foe. When General Lord Stirling had moved his men to the Short Hills area, suddenly the hunter became the hunted when Howe sent a larger force to attack them. The Americans, though hard pressed, managed to avoid being mangled or destroyed and fought a delaying battle while most of the American force escaped the trap. Washington, who had finally moved out of the Watchung Mountains, moved back and ordered his commands around New Brunswick to do the same. With the Americans moved away from his boarding troops, Howe was able to put his men aboard ships and abandon New Jersey in relative security. The British left New Brunswick and Staten Island to later attack Philadelphia.The Battle of Bound Brook by Weldon Monsport, retrieved January 24, 2006 Battle of Monmouth Washington Rallying the Troops at Monmouth by Emanuel Leutze In 1777, the British retreated to New York City to protect it from an expected French attack. Washington quickly ordered his soldiers to march towards the British and met them at the Battle of Monmouth. On June 28, 1778, the Continental Army under George Washington met a British column under Sir Henry Clinton. George Washington hoped to surprise the rear of the British army and overwhelm them. General Charles Lee led the American attack on the British rear but retreated quickly when the British attempted to flank the Americans. The retreat nearly led to massive disorder, but Washington managed to personally rally the troops to withstand the British counterattacks. The British attempted two attacks to defeat the Americans; both failed. As exceedingly high temperatures continued to increase over , many soldiers fell to sunstroke. After the battle, Charles Lee was court martialed for his poor army command. Over 1,000 British casualties were incurred; the Americans lost about 452 men. This battle inspired the legend of Molly Pitcher.The different tales that related to Molly Pitcher (whose real name is Mary Hays McCauly) tales are now regarded by most historians as folklore rather than history, though real women did actually inspire these stories. Baylor Massacre The Baylor Massacre was an attack on September 27, 1778 upon the 3rd Regiment of Continental Light Dragoons under the command of Colonel George Baylor during the American Revolutionary War. It occurred in the present day town of River Vale, New Jersey. During the night, they were betrayed by loyalists, who informed the British of their location. Using bayonets, the British killed, injured, or took as prisoners 67 of the dragoons. Battle of Paulus Hook Paulus Hook was a peninsula at what is now Jersey City, and a major landing point for anyone going from New York City into New Jersey. Since it was on the Hudson River, the British fleet was able to protect it. The British used it to send raiders into Bergen County. Militia tried to stand guard to prevent or harass these raiders. The Battle of Paulus Hook was fought on August 19, 1779, between Colonial and British forces. The patriots were led by Light Horse Harry Lee, and launched a night attack on the British-controlled fort. They surprised the British, taking several prisoners, but had to withdraw before daylight when the British navy could react. The fort continued to be used as a base of operations against Bergen County patriots. Battle of Connecticut Farms On June 6, 1780, British troops boarded boats on Staten Island bound for Elizabeth, New Jersey. At midnight, 5,000 troops started to land. They expected the Continental Army to give little resistance, believing that they were tired of the war and were poorly fed and paid. They also expected the citizens of New Jersey to welcome them. They were wrong on both counts. Once they began to march into Elizabeth, they were attacked by Lt. Ogden, who was stationed to give an alarm outside of town with a small group of men. Ogden had orders to fire one volley and retreat. That volley wounded British General Stirling in the thigh, and delayed the advance several hours. The New Jersey Brigade of the Continental Army, in and around Elizabeth, moved back toward Connecticut Farms, now Union Township, New Jersey, sending word to Morristown to the main army under Washington. The New Jersey brigade was heavily outnumbered. The warnings to the militia also went out, and they began to form up and march toward the British from as far away as Hopewell, New Jersey. When the British did advance, they were attacked by the militia on the flanks. This drew off significant portions of their forces to protect their supply line and route of travel. General William Maxwell, commanding the New Jersey Brigade, set up a defense at defiles on the road to Connecticut Farms. After a day of hot fighting, the British realized they could not easily breakthrough toward the Hobart Gap leading to Morristown, and, after burning the town, retired back to Elizabeth point. Battle of Springfield The last major battle to take place in New Jersey and the rest of the Northern states during the Revolutionary War was the Battle of Springfield. Baron von Knyphausen, the Hessian general, hoped to invade New Jersey and expected support from the colonists of New Jersey who were tired of the war. His goal was to secure Hobart Gap, from which he could attack the American headquarters situated in Morristown. On June 23, 1780, the British attacked soldiers and militia under the command of Nathanael Greene. General Greene successfully stopped a two- pronged attack from positions held across the Rahway River. The victory prevented a British attack on Morristown and its military stores. Nathanael Greene's personal assistant was Thomas Paine. Final Skirmishes of the American Revolution Several small conflicts and skirmishes took place in New Jersey just before and after the Battle of Yorktown, representing the final conflicts of the American Revolution. The Skirmish at Manahawkin took place on December 30 & 31, 1781 when militiamen clashed with John Bacon and approximately 30 and 40 men, resulting in one death and one injury.Salter, Edward. Centennial History of Ocean County. Toms River, NJ, 1878, page 24 REVOLUTIONARY WAR SITES IN MANAHAWKIN, NEW JERSEY.

Accessed May 14, 2016 In October 25, 1782, after formal hostilities between the United States and Great Britain had paused, Bacon and his men murdered 19 men in their sleep, including Patriot militia Captain Andrew Steelman, in what is known as the Long Beach Island Massacre.

The Affair at Cedar Bridge in Barnegat Township was the last conflict between British allied forces of the American Revolution which took place in December 1782. One Patriot was killed, and four were wounded. Four Loyalists were wounded, including Bacon.Donnelly, Mark and Diehl, Daniel. Pirates of New Jersey: Plunder and High Adventure on the Garden State Coastline 2010, pages 79-80 Support and encouragement generated by newspaper The New Jersey Journal became the second newspaper published in the state. It was edited and printed by Shepard Kollock, who established his press in Chatham during 1779. This paper became a catalyst in the revolution. News of events regarding the war came directly to the editor from Washington's headquarters in nearby Morristown to boost the morale of the troops and their families, and as editor, he conducted lively debates about the efforts for independence with those who opposed and supported the cause he championed. Kollock later relocated the paper twice, first to New Brunswick when the military action shifted there, and later in 1785, when he established his last publication location in Elizabeth under the same name. The Journal ceased publication in 1992. Original New Jersey State Constitution In 1776, the first New Jersey State Constitution was drafted. It was written during the period of the Revolutionary War, and was designed to create a basic framework for the state government. The constitution recognized the right of suffrage for women and black men who met certain property requirements. The New Jersey Constitution of 1776 gives the vote to \\"all inhabitants of this Colony, of full age, who are worth fifty pounds proclamation money.\\" This included blacks, spinsters, and widows. (Married women could not own property under the common law.) It had been held that this was an accident of hasty drafting: the British were at Staten Island when the constitution was proclaimed. The Constitution declares itself temporary, and it was to be void if there was reconciliation with Great Britain.Klinghoffer and Elkis. \\"The Petticoat Electors: Women‚Äôs Suffrage in New Jersey, 1776‚Äì1807.\\" Journal of the Early Republic, 12, no. 2 (1992): 159‚Äì193. Both sides in elections mocked the other for relying on \\"petticoat electors\\" and each accused the other of letting unqualified women (including married women) vote. A Federalist legislature passed a voting rights act which applied only to those counties where the Federalists were strong. A Democratic legislature extended it to the entire state. In 1807, as a side-effect of a reconciliation within the Democratic Party, the legislature reinterpreted the constitution (which had been an ordinary act of the Provincial Congress) to mean universal white male suffrage, with no property requirement. However, they disenfranchised paupers, to suppress the Irish vote. After the war In the summer of 1783, the Continental Congress met in Nassau Hall of Princeton University. It had originally convened in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but mutinous troops prevented the meeting from taking place there. Princeton became the temporary capital for the newly independent nation through these four months. During the brief stay in Princeton, the Continental Congress was informed of the end of the war by the signing of the Treaty of Paris on September 3, 1783. The chief dignitary of the meeting was George Washington, and a portrait was made of Washington during the meeting. On December 18, 1787, New Jersey became the third state to ratify the Constitution. On November 20, 1789, New Jersey became the first state in the nation to ratify the Bill of Rights. New Jersey played a principal role in creating the structure of the new United States Government. When Virginia delegates came up with the Virginia Plan, which called for representation in government proportional to the population of each state, the smaller states refused, fearing that with such a plan they would no longer have a say in government affairs. William Paterson, a New Jersey statesman, introduced the New Jersey Plan by which one vote would be given to each state, providing equal representation within the legislative body. Under the Great Compromise, both plans were placed into use with two separate bodies in the Congress, with the Senate being modeled after the structure in the New Jersey Plan.

His story was made into the 1993 film Money for Nothing, starring John Cusack, as well as a 2002 book by Mark Bowden, Finders Keepers: The Story of a Man Who Found $1 Million. Coyle passed out some of the money, in $100 bills, to friends and neighbors.

Cir. 1996) was a Second Circuit Court of Appeals case involving the petitioner, a boy named Daniel Immediato and his parents, Eugene and Diane Immediato, against the respondent, Rye Neck School District in the village of Mamaroneck, New York. The court held that the school district did not violate Immediato's rights by requiring him to perform community service.  Background  Daniel Immediato felt that the school district's policy of establishing mandatory community service was in violation of his 13th and 14th Amendment rights. The school district required that 40 hours of community service be completed to graduate with no exceptions. Regulations on what could be done for community service were fairly lax, as all work for non-profit organizations with the exception of religious organizations that did no charitable work was accepted as community service. As part of a mandatory senior-year course, students had to complete a form about what community service they did and how it benefited them, and afterwards discuss it with the class. Certain goals had to be reached by certain periods of the senior year.  Complaint  Immediato brought forth the following charges: \\"Specifically, they assert that the program: (1) imposes involuntary servitude upon Daniel, in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment; (2) infringes on Daniel's parents' Fourteenth Amendment right to direct his upbringing and education; (3) infringes on Daniel's personal liberty, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; and (4) violates Daniel's right to privacy, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\"  Result  The school district denied that any violation was made and argued that the court should abstain because of the ruling of Burford v. Sun Oil Co. (that federal court should not hear any case involving complicated state laws that deal with policy issues). The court decided against this Burford abstention but found that none of the charges were true. Immediato proceeded to appeal using the same charges. Immediato's arguments were found to be invalid, and the court stuck with their ruling that the school district did not violate any of Daniel or his parents' Constitutional rights in imposing community service.

After immigrating to the United States in 1940, she taught at Pond Farm and wrote three influential books‚ÄîPottery: Form and Expression (1959), The Invisible Core: A Potter's Life and Thoughts (1973), and ‚Ä¶that We Look and See: An Admirer Looks at the Indians (1979). Artist Robert Arneson described her as \\"the grande dame of potters,\\". Early life Wildenhain was born in Lyon, France, to a British mother, Rose Calmann and a German father, Th√©odore Friedlaender, who was a silk merchant. Her brother was the Israeli typographer Henri Friedlaender. She received a primary education first in Germany, then in Yorkshire, England. At the start of World War I, her family moved to Germany where she completed secondary school. Beginning in 1914, she studied sculpture at the Berlin University of the Arts, then worked as a decorator of porcelain ware at a factory in Rudolstadt. It was at that factory where her passion for the potter's wheel ignited. When she was not working at the factory, she explored the countryside. Shortly after World War I, while in Weimar for a weekend, she happened upon the posted proclamation by architect Walter Gropius about the founding of the Bauhaus school in 1919: \\"\\"a new guild of craftsmen without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between craftsmen and artists\\". Then and there, as she recalled in her autobiography, she decided to become one of the first students to enroll. Bauhaus and after During her time at Bauhaus, Wildenhain studied alongside painters Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky and she worked closely with sculptor Gerhard Marcks (her Formmeister or Form Master) and potter Max Krehan (her Lehrmeister or Crafts Master). In 1925, Wildenhain became the first woman to earn the Master Potter certification in Germany. In 1926, she left the school and moved to Halle- Saale, Germany, where she was appointed head of the ceramics workshop at the Burg Giebichenstein School of Fine and Applied Art. While there, she also became associated with Konigliche Porzellan-Manufaktur (or KPM), now Staatliche Porzellan-Manufaktur, for which she designed the prototypes for elegant, mass-produced dinnerware, most notably the Halle tea set and the Burg-Giebichenstein dinner service (both in 1930). The same year, she married a younger ceramic artist named Frans or Franz Wildenhain (1905‚Äì80), who had earlier been her classmate at the Weimar Bauhaus and served as her apprentice at Burg Giebichenstein. When the Nazis came to power in 1933, Wildenhain was forced to leave her teaching post because of her Jewish ancestry. With her husband (a non-Jewish German citizen), she moved to Putten, Netherlands, where the couple established a pottery shop called Het Kruikje (The Little Jug), and where, until 1940, they lived by making pottery. In advance of the Nazi invasion, Wildenhain was able to leave Holland in 1940 and to emigrate to New York, but her husband's concurrent request was denied. Pond Farm Wildenhain moved from New York to California on May 27, 1940 where she held a teaching position for two years at the California College of Arts and Crafts (CCAC) in Oakland. In the early 1940s, Wildenhain relocated to Pond Farm, a tract of farmland owned by architect Gordon Herr and his wife Jane Herr, where she focused on creating the workshop it would become. After gaining U.S. citizenship in 1945, Wildenhain was able to fund and to sponsor the emigration of her husband (who, in the years of their separation, had been drafted into the German army). The Pond Farm Workshops, as they became known, ran from 1949-1952 and were run by Gordon Herr, Marguerite and Franz Wildenhain, and two other artist colleagues, textile artist Trude Guermonprez (born Jalowetz) and metals artist Victor Ries. Collage artist Jean Varda and sculptor Claire Falkenstein also taught at Pond Farm once per week. In these demanding workshops, focused on using the Bauhaus-style kick wheel, students created hundreds of ceramic forms such as flower pots, bowls, pitchers, cups, and tea pots. During the workshops, the students focused on the mastery of process rather than the glazing and firing of wares. During breaks, students and teachers discussed topics such as nature and music, philosophy, leaf structure, and bookkeeping. The Pond Farm truly functioned as a \\"school for life\\". Many of her students went on to become successful professional ceramicists, and credit Wildenhain with monumental growth in their artistic careers. The Pond Farm Workshops eventually ended for a number of reasons: Herr's dominant leadership style, disregarded requests for communal ownership by the artists, Jane Herr's 1952 death from cancer, and more. Franz also left Marguerite and took a faculty position in the School For American Craftsmen at the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York, while Marguerite continued to live at Pond Farm. Later years In the years that followed, as Marguerite Wildenhain's artistic stature grew, she continued to operate her own summer school, accepting twenty or more students each year. She also published three books (Pottery: Form and Expression; The Invisible Core: A Potter's Life and Thoughts; and That We Look and See: An Admirer Looks at the Indians), lectured at schools throughout the U.S., and took solo expeditions to South and Central America, Europe, and the Middle East. Since her death at age 88, the grounds and buildings at Pond Farm have been preserved, and are now officially a part of the California State Parks system. Pond farm and the Austin Creek Recreational Area were recently taken over by an operating agreement between \\"Stewards of the Coast and Redwoods\\" and the State Parks. Shortly after Stewards took on the responsibility of keeping this State Park open, Pond Farm was designated a \\"National Treasure\\" by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and with this status, plans are moving forward to restore and preserve the studio and home. Ultimately Pond Farm will be accessible for public use in some appropriate form, yet to be determined. Iconography * Charles Crodel: Die T√∂pferin Marguerite Friedlaender, Berliner Sezession, 64.

The building is made with primarily ferrocemento and glass. Ferrocemento is a form of concrete construction made with thin cross-sections of concrete and metal wires (reinforcement) with re-usable forms, which Nervi pioneered in Italy and elsewhere. 2006 Olympics The Torino Esposizioni was converted into a temporary ice rink to host a number of ice hockey events at the 2006 Winter Olympics along with Palasport Olimpico.2006 Winter Olympics official report. Volume 3. pp. 86-7. The temporary arena holds 4,320 people. The boards in the hockey rink are stiffer than in a permanent facility, while the glass has more give. The facility was converted into an ice rink by laying a sand base and refrigeration pipes into the base, and then freezing water ice atop the substrate. This is similar to the temporary outdoor rink the NHL used for its Heritage Classic game in Edmonton. After the Olympics were complete, the arena returned to hosting fairs and exhibitions.  In film  The building appears in a deleted scene from the 1969 film The Italian Job. A portion of the car chase was filmed as a dance between the Minis and police cars with a full orchestra playing \\"The Blue Danube\\" as accompaniment. The scene appears as an extra on home video releases.

It is a beautiful area that offers gardening, education, and relaxation. The arboretum also boasts the unique view of a savannah! The arboretum began in 2001, when Warren Township purchased the Wagner Farm property. In 2002 the town's advisory committee suggested that the site be made into an arboretum, and a nonprofit organization to this end was formed in 2004. In the Spring of 2007, Wagner Farm Arboretum collaborated with The Gardeners of Watchung Hills to open the Community Garden. It was also during this year that the Giving Garden Project (GGP) started and as of 2017 has distributed over 100,000 pounds of produce to the needy. The GGP partners with the Wagner Farm Arboretum ‚ÄúGrowing To Give‚Äù educational program and the local elementary schools to help students plant seeds, learn about the environment and understand the social aspects of giving back to a community. The Children plant seeds in flats and tend them for several weeks in their classrooms. Then in the Spring, they plant the seedlings in the Giving Garden plots. The Children's Garden broke ground in the fall of 2008 and has become a wonderful place for children and adults to explore and relax. In 2014, Wagner Farm Arboretum celebrated its 10th year as a non-profit organization. Over the years since its incorporation, through the leadership of the members of the Board of Trustees, and with the tireless efforts of many volunteers and committee members, the Arboretum has made an impact to the community and environment one step at a time, one seedling at a time, and one helping hand at a time.

It has three car parks and is a few minutes walk away from both Derby's bus and railway stations. The UK's largest, but mainly unoccupied, indoor market, the Eagle Market, adjoins the centre. The market and Derby Theatre, which is accessed through the market, were considered to be part of the centre until 2007, when the centre was known as The Eagle Centre. When the centre was expanded and renamed (see below), the market, owned by the Westfield Group and Herm√®s, but operated by Derby City Council, did not take on the Westfield name; it slightly changed its name from the Eagle Centre Market to simply the Eagle Market and introduced its own branding, separate from both the former Eagle Centre's and Westfield's), making itself distinct from the shopping centre for the first time. A much smaller indoor shopping precinct, St Peter's Way, is also physically connected to Intu Derby. Customers can walk seamlessly between the two. History The centre opened as The Eagle Centre on 20 November 1975, at a cost of ¬£7 million. Several streets of terraced housing built in the early 1820s were demolished to make way for the new centre, including a street called Eagle Street, which gave the name of the new development.

It is primarily used for ice hockey and is the home arena of the Liiga team HPK and the Naisten Liiga team HPK Kiekkonaiset. History In 1963, an artificial skating rinks current capacity is kelinm√§ki. A building was built over the rink after it switched over as city property in 1979. Since then, the building has been called an arena. The arena project started around 1976 because of pressure from HPK. This led to the formation of a committee that was led by HPK chairman, bank manager Seppo Nenonen. The committee made a property plan based on its research, knowing that the project's expenses needed to be in the minimum for it to succeed ‚Äì and success still wasn't certain. All extra spaces had to be cut out: no break rooms and no concession areas. The most important thing was, that the building would be enclosed. The situation was poor. Today, some say that when people complain publicly about the current arena, the forget about the previous times. The arena was planned by the city architectural department led by city architect Heikki Aitola. The planners of the subsequent extension phases have been mostly building architect Seppo Ilmarinen from the city architectural department and his son, architect Petri Ilmarinen. H√§meenlinnan J√§√§halli Oy, the company managing the arena, was founded on February 3, 1992. In the same year, a practice arena was finished and in 1996, the main arena was expanded based on the new requirements by SM-liiga. These requirements stated, that a league arena must hold at least 5,000 people. At the same time, ownership of the arena was switched to the management company. In 2002, a two-track ice exercise center was finished. As a tribute to ten years of the arena company, the arena was renamed as Ritarihalli. The arena was renovated again in 2008 to hold 5,360 spectators and also, merchandise and restaurant areas were refurbished. The arena was a venue for the 2009 Women's World Ice Hockey Championships, with matches being held both in the main and practice rinks.

It was part of the 1980 NCAA Division I-A football season. The game is famous due to a furious fourth quarter rally‚Äîincluding a last-second \\"miracle\\" touchdown‚Äîthat gave BYU a 46‚Äì45 victory over SMU. Thus, the game is known as the ‚ÄúMiracle Bowl‚Äù, especially among BYU fans.https://www.deseret.com/2014/12/19/20554641/miracle- bowl-34-years-later-i-don-t-know-how-you-could-top-this-one Background The Holiday Bowl was a young bowl game at the time, in only its third year. The 1980 Holiday Bowl pitted Brigham Young University (BYU) against Southern Methodist University (SMU). BYU entered the game with an 11‚Äì1 record. After losing the first game of the season (a 25‚Äì21 upset against New Mexico), the Cougars won 11 straight games to claim the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Championship. BYU had overwhelmed most opponents with a high-powered pass- oriented offense led by future NFL quarterback Jim McMahon. The Cougars led the NCAA in total offense (535.0 yards per game), scoring (46.7 points per game), and passing offense (409.8 passing yards per game) during the 1980 regular season. In contrast, SMU entered the game with an explosive run-heavy offense, nicknamed the \\"Pony Express.\\" The Mustangs were led by two star running backs, Craig James and Eric Dickerson. Both James and Dickerson went on to careers in the NFL; Dickerson achieved superstar status with the Los Angeles Rams from 1983‚Äì1986, and with the Indianapolis Colts from 1987‚Äì1991. The Mustangs entered the game with an 8‚Äì3 record, impressive considering they played in the tough Southwest Conference (SWC). Game summary BYU had never won a bowl game in school history, having lost the 1974 Fiesta Bowl and 1976 Tangerine Bowl as well as the first two Holiday Bowls in 1978 and 1979. For the first 56 minutes of the 1980 Holiday Bowl, it seemed the Cougars were destined for another defeat. BYU's defense couldn't handle SMU's offense, as James ran for 225 yards and Dickerson added 110. With just four minutes left in the game, the Mustangs scored to take a commanding 45‚Äì25 lead. Many BYU fans started leaving the stadium. McMahon screamed at them, declaring that the game wasn't over yet. He promptly threw a touchdown pass to Matt Braga, and BYU recovered an onside kick. The Cougars quickly marched down the field, ending the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run by Scott Phillips. SMU's lead had now been trimmed to 45‚Äì39. The Cougar defense forced the Mustangs to punt on their next possession. BYU's Bill Schoepflin blocked the punt by SMU's Eric Kaifes with 13 seconds left. The Cougar offense took over at the 41-yard line, with a last chance to win the game. After throwing two incomplete passes, McMahon launched a Hail Mary into the end zone as time expired. Smothered by four SMU defenders, BYU tight end Clay Brown somehow managed to leap above them and haul in the football, scoring one of the most miraculous touchdowns in college football history. With the score tied, BYU's Kurt Gunther kicked the winning extra point to give the Cougars a miracle 46‚Äì45 victory. BYU scored 21 points in the last 2:33. McMahon completed 32 of 49 passes for 446 yards to share MVP honors with SMU's James. The final statistics were remarkably even: SMU racked up 25 first downs and 446 total yards; BYU finished with 23 first downs and 444 total yards. http://byucougars.com/files/media_guides/m-football/2010/tradition/bowl-1980.htmlhttp://sltrib.cougarstats.com/games.php?show=details&game;_id=397http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865616975/1980-Miracle- Bowl-In-a-battle-between-the-Mormons-and-Methodists-did-the-Catholics-win.html Scoring summary *SMU - Dickerson 15-yard run touchdown *SMU - James 45-yard run touchdown *SMU - Safety *SMU - Garcia 42-yard field goal *BYU - Brown 64-yard pass touchdown from McMahon (Gunther kick) *SMU - James 3-yard pass touchdown from McIlhenny (Garcia kick) *SMU - Garcia 44-yard field goal *BYU - Sikahema 83-yard punt return touchdown (pass failed) *SMU - Dickerson 1-yard run (pass failed) *BYU - Brown 13-yard pass touchdown from McMahon (pass failed) *SMU - Garcia 42-yard field goal *BYU - Phillips 1-yard run touchdown (pass failed) *SMU - James 42-yard run touchdown (Garcia kick) *BYU - Braga 15-yard pass touchdown from McMahon (Pass failed) *BYU - Phillips 1-yard run touchdown (pass to Phillips) *BYU - Brown 41-yard pass touchdown from McMahon (Gunther kick) Legacy In 2003, ESPN's \\"Page 2\\" feature listed the 1980 Holiday Bowl as one of the top 10 greatest bowl games ever played.ESPN.com - Page 2 - The List: Greatest Bowl Games The game was placed in NCAA Football video games as a \\"College Classic\\", challenging players to recreate the ending.

Biography In the early 1970s, Hoffman worked in radio and earned a degree in mass communications from California State University, Northridge. During the late 1970s, Hoffman joined MCA Records as catalog research and development coordinator. For the next decade, he was responsible for compiling hundreds of budget cassette releases for MCA's Special Products division. His primary focus was on jazz and big band recordings. In 1985 he worked on a series of releases aimed at the CD market which bore the title \\"From the Original Master Tapes.\\" This series included works of artists such as Buddy Holly, Bill Haley and John Coltrane. He was later fired from MCA, and has plied his trade with the Dunhill Compact Classics and Audio Fidelity labels, owned by Marshall Blonstein, former vice president of Ode Records. Hoffman has also worked with other labels on occasion, including Analogue Productions, Rural Rhythm, Razor & Tie, and S&P.;http://www.stevehoffman.tv/discography/index.php Steve Hoffman co-wrote and recorded as a musician (drums and guitar) the surf rock instrumental \\"Cecilia Ann\\" with childhood friend Charles \\"Frosty\\" Horton, under the moniker of The Surftones. The track was recorded to provide an opener for a sixties surf rock anthology assembled by Hoffman in 1989, and gained popularity when it was covered by the Pixies, also as an opener on their 1990 album Bossanova. Approach Hoffman's method of transferring tapes is minimalist. The adjustments he makes depend on the quality of the tape source and the equalization choices of the mixing engineer. While he avoids compression, limiting, and noise reduction, he does add \\"colorations\\" through subtractive equalization and up to five layers of vacuum tube distortion.Tape Op Magazine > Articles > Steve Hoffman[Mono And Stereo: Interview With Steve Hoffman The Picks' overdubs In February 1984, Hoffman sent what are known as safety copies of several Buddy Holly master recordings to John Pickering of The Picks who took them to Sound Masters studios in Houston, Texas. There, the reunited group overdubbed new vocal parts onto at least 60 recordings, and sent them back to Hoffman at MCA. The belief was that, under Hoffman's influence, MCA would have issued these \\"new\\" recordings as an album, perhaps to commemorate the 25th year since Holly's death. This did not occur, and Hoffman was subsequently fired from MCA. In 1992, Pickering approached Viceroy Records to arrange a deal for nationwide distribution of these overdubbed recordings, but MCA made it clear that Pickering did not have legal clearance to release such recordings.

It is primarily used for ice hockey, and is the home arena of Ilves and Tappara of the Finnish Liiga. The ice hall, designed by the architect Jaakko T√§htinen was built for the 1965 World Ice Hockey Championships and opened the same year. The current capacity of the ice hall for hockey games is 7,300 spectators (5,629 seats, 1,359 standing, 312 suites). Tampere ice stadium is the third biggest ice hall in the Finnish ice hockey league. As there are several ice hockey venues in Tampere, this primary one is usually called \\"Hakamets√§n j√§√§halli\\" (after the district where it is located) or, more precisely, \\"Hakamets√§ 1\\" to distinguish it from the two smaller halls nearby. History Tampere Ice Stadium is the first and the oldest ice hockey arena in the country. Finland was awarded the opportunity to host the 1965 ice hockey World Championships, and Helsinki was to build an arena for the tournament. However, Helsinki did not manage to finish the project in time, and Tampere was asked to build an arena and host the games instead. The first game in the arena was an all-star game between Tampere and the rest of Finland, played on January 29, 1965. The score was tied at 4‚Äì4. The first league game was played by the local teams Ilves and Tappara on January 31, with Ilves taking a 5‚Äì3 win. Originally, the spectator capacity of the Tampereen j√§√§halli was 10,200 people, with only 1,573 seats on the eastern side of the rink. The ice hall has also served as one of the venues of the IIHF World Championship in 1982, 1991, 1997 and 2003 and also for the IIHF Women's World Championship in 1992. Besides ice hockey, the venue has been used to host several other sports events, including the European and World Championships of boxing, wrestling, judo, and karate, and international matches of volleyball. Over the years there have also been several concerts by both domestic and international artists in the hall. Features An inside view.The stands in the arena are of a rather rectangular shape, and are composed of a single level main stand and an overhanging balcony on the western side. On the eastern side there are 20 suites as well as facilities for the media. The standing places are located in the corners of the stands. Currently, the majority of the seats are padded, with some unpadded plastic seats remaining on the balcony. In 2007, a new video screen cube was installed in the arena. Of note is the fact that the balcony hanging over the stand B blocks the view to the screen from the uppermost rows. This has been augmented by placing TV monitors under the balcony, mirroring the output of the screen. There are several bars, restaurants and fast food stalls around the ice hall, as well as fan shops and the VIP clubs of the two local hockey teams. Future In the late 1990s and the early 2000s there were plans to build a new multi-purpose arena in Tampere, following the example of the Hartwall Areena built in Helsinki in 1997. However, these plans did not come to fruition, and the Hakamets√§ arena continues to serve as the primary hockey venue in the city. In May 2010, the Tampere City Council approved plans for the Tampereen monitoimiareena which is currently under construction.

Under the policy, each television network in the U.S. had a responsibility to air \\"family-friendly\\" programming during the first hour of the prime time lineup (8 to 9 p.m. Eastern Time). The hour disappeared in 1977 after the policy was overturned in court; however, the concept has continued to be used by some viewers who still believe that the 8:00 p.m. time slot in primetime has an obligation to have family-friendly programming.  Background  In 1974, there was widespread public criticism regarding the amount of sex and violence then on American television. Although there are several examples, there was one television scene that caused a particularly strong backlash. The 1974 NBC television movie Born Innocent featured a lesbian rape scene, and was even briefly shown in daytime promotional spots for the film. The scene drew much outcry upon its first airing and was blamed for the real-life rape of a young girl, which led to a case before the California Supreme Court. In January 1975, then-FCC chairman Richard E. Wiley addressed the Senate and House Communications and Commerce Subcommittees, stating that all three networks agreed to adopt a \\"family viewing hour\\" in response to the criticism. The National Association of Broadcasters took the gesture one step further, decreeing that local stations also air family friendly programming in the 7 p.m. time slot, a time that networks were forbidden from programming under the Prime Time Access Rule and were thus up to the individual stations to program. The president of CBS at the time wanted to go through with the measure but would only agree if NBC and ABC consented, citing a possible decline in ratings (the network had been #1 in U.S. households since the mid-1950s) if they were the only network to try the new policy. By the end of 1974, each network executive agreed to endorse the Family Viewing Hour, and to implement it by the fall 1975 season. Indeed, many television series suffered from the Family Viewing Hour mandate. All in the Family, which was the runaway top-rated show in the U.S. since 1971, was moved to 9 p.m. on Mondays after five seasons leading the Saturday night lineup. Producer Norman Lear, citing an infringement on creative freedom and on his First Amendment rights, mounted a lawsuit. With the support of varying guilds, including the WGA, he won the case. The show's cast responded by recording a satirical, never-aired rendition of the show's theme song, retitled \\"These Are the Days\\". On November 4, 1976, United States district court Judge Warren J. Ferguson declared the Family Viewing Hour unconstitutional. Ferguson stated while the idea was good in theory, the FCC had overstepped its bounds in having it instituted; the FCC privately lobbied the three major networks to adopt the policy instead of holding public hearings on the matter, and Ferguson ruled on those grounds that the Family Viewing Hour had no binding merit. The decree made by the National Association of Broadcasters in 1975 was also overturned, giving stations free rein on what to air in the pre-prime time slots.  Use of the concept today  After the Family Viewing Hour was declared unconstitutional, the networks continued voluntarily to offer family-friendly programs such as The Cosby Show and Happy Days in the early primetime hours, so some families still believed in the concept. Due to this point of view, in 1989, Michigan housewife Terry Rakolta started a highly public letter-writing campaign to persuade advertisers to stop sponsoring the Fox network sitcom Married... with Children after watching the episode \\"Her Cups Runneth Over\\" with her three youngest children. Consequently, two companies completely withdrew sponsorship from the show, while other companies, including The Coca-Cola Company, simply reduced sponsorship. Starting in the 2000-2001 season, ABC stopped showing commercials for R-rated films during the first hour of primetime. In 2003, The New York Times reported that FCC commissioner Kevin Martin called to bring back the Family Hour. In 2001, the Parents Television Council (PTC) campaigned for the FCC to reuse the Family Hour voluntarily following its report The Sour Family Hour. Over the years, the PTC has run numerous reports claiming that the so- called \\"Family Hour\\" of 8:00 p.m. (7:00 p.m. in Central and Mountain Time Zones) is becoming more unsuitable for family viewing, having released a report in September 2007. Bernard Goldberg and Zell Miller have used the term \\"family hour\\" in their books to describe the early primetime hours as well. The advent of streaming television has rendered the concept of a strictly defined \\"family hour\\" difficult to enforce, given that the technology provides consumers with the ability to view adult-themed programming (including sexual content, violence and language that far exceeds what has ever been allowed on commercial broadcast television) at any time of the day.

The chinrest may be made of ebony, rosewood, boxwood, or plastic. It was invented by Louis Spohr in the early 19th century, about 1820; historically, this has been explained as a response to increasingly difficult repertoire which demanded freer left hand techniques than had previously been used; however, Spohr intended his small block attached to the bout to protect the tailpiece, which he reportedly broke with his vigorous playing. However, after being promoted by prominent violinists of the day, such as Pierre Baillot and Giovanni Battista Viotti, it gained quick acceptance among most violists & violinists and is today considered a standard part of the viola and violin. Chinrest attachment Chinrest clamp wrench The chinrest is attached to the instrument by one or two metal clamps that hook over the edge of the back. One or two turnbuckles or machine screws provide slight clamping tension to hold the chinrest in place. In most cases, two screws are joined by a metal bar that conforms to the back edge of the instrument, whereas \\"Hill-style\\" clamps are used in a pair, each clamp having its own foot and its own screw, with no bar joining them. The clamps and the chinrest itself are usually padded with cork, leather, or felt where they contact the instrument to minimize damage to the wood. For side-mount chinrests, the clamp is placed on the bass side of the instrument; center- mount rests are placed so that the chinrest straddles the tailpiece. The latter may be considered a safer installation, as the clamps get support from the bottom block, and there is less chance that overtightening will cause damage. A special pin wrench may be used for easy adjustment of the clamp tension without damaging the rib of the violin. The clamps of some modern chinrests are adjusted with a Torx or small Phillips screwdriver, or with a hex key. Types Spohr's original design called for a small block of wood to be centered over the tailpiece, but soon evolved. Today, there are at least 50 different types of chinrests available. Most common models of chinrests in ebony and rosewood One of the most popular type of chinrest is the \\"Guarneri\\" type, whose attachment is centered over the tailpiece with the cup for the chin to the left of the tailpiece. Some players prefer a chinrest with the cup centered over the tailpiece. The \\"Flesch\\" chinrest is of this type. As described in the preceding section, some chinrests attach to the left of the end button. Chinrests are available in different heights and shapes. Violin and viola pedagogue Susan Kempter advocates having a luthier customize the chinrest by shaping it to fit the player's jaw properly and either raising or reducing the height until it fits the player's neck height as well. Other considerations The chinrest should be placed so it does not touch or buzz against the tailpiece or belly of the instrument. Pressure from the chinrest against the player's skin can result in a common irritation known as \\"fiddler's neck\\" or \\"plague\\". It can also be caused by bacteria or fungus living on the wood or by an allergic reaction to the metals used in the chinrest. Some players prefer to use a cloth, such as a handkerchief, to cover the chinrest, to avoid this irritation and make playing more comfortable. Several types of padded fabric slipcovers are also commercially available. They may not only cover the chinrest cup, but also extend to provide a barrier between the metal clamp hardware and the skin‚Äîbeneficial if the hardware is plated with nickel and the player is allergic to the metal. Hypo-allergenic chinrests (with plastic or titanium fittings) are also available. Vociferous debate may be elicited in some circles by suggesting that a violin sounds better without a chinrest, or that better technique and posture is developed without it. The chinrest did not significantly increase the playability of the violin. It has been suggested that Paganini played without a chinrest, and there is significant evidence to suggest; he played mostly on a short-necked violin more akin to the Baroque instrument, and used gut strings, and is always depicted in his famous posture--that is further suggestion he isn't using a chinrest. A few professionals today (notably Regina Carter) also eschew the use of a chinrest on their modern instruments.

In practice, this means applying colour and materials to military equipment of all kinds, including vehicles, ships, aircraft, gun positions and battledress, either to conceal it from observation (crypsis), or to make it appear as something else (mimicry). The French slang word camouflage came into common English usage during World War I when the concept of visual deception developed into an essential part of modern military tactics. In that war, long-range artillery and observation from the air combined to expand the field of fire, and camouflage was widely used to decrease the danger of being targeted or to enable surprise. As such, military camouflage is a form of military deception. Camouflage was first practiced in simple form in the mid 18th century by rifle units. Their tasks required them to be inconspicuous, and they were issued green and later other drab colour uniforms. With the advent of longer range and more accurate weapons, especially the repeating rifle, camouflage was adopted for the uniforms of all armies, spreading to most forms of military equipment including ships and aircraft. Many modern camouflage textiles address visibility not only to visible light but also near infrared, for concealment from night vision devices. Camouflage is not only visual; heat, sound, magnetism and even smell can be used to target weapons, and may be intentionally concealed. Some forms of camouflage have elements of scale invariance, designed to disrupt outlines at different distances, typically digital camouflage patterns made of pixels. Camouflage patterns also have cultural functions such as political identification. Camouflage for equipment and positions was extensively developed for military use by the French in 1915, soon followed by other World War I armies. In both world wars, artists were recruited as camouflage officers. Ship camouflage developed via conspicuous dazzle camouflage schemes during WWI, but since the development of radar, ship camouflage has received less attention. Aircraft, especially in World War II, were often countershaded: painted with different schemes above and below, to camouflage them against the ground and sky respectively. Military camouflage patterns have been popular in fashion and art from as early as 1915. Camouflage patterns have appeared in the work of artists such as Andy Warhol and Ian Hamilton Finlay, sometimes with an anti-war message. In fashion, many major designers have exploited camouflage's style and symbolism, and military clothing or imitations of it have been used both as street wear and as a symbol of political protest. Principles A-7D Corsairs in a disruptive pattern, countershaded with white, on a disruptively painted surface, Thailand, 1972. Military camouflage is part of the art of military deception. The main objective of military camouflage is to deceive the enemy as to the presence, position and intentions of military formations. Camouflage techniques include concealment, disguise, and dummies, applied to troops, vehicles, and positions. Vision is the main sense of orientation in humans, and the primary function of camouflage is to deceive the human eye. Camouflage works through concealment (whether by countershading, preventing casting shadows, or disruption of outlines), mimicry, or possibly by dazzle. In modern warfare, some forms of camouflage, for example face paints, also offer concealment from infrared sensors, while CADPAT textiles in addition help to provide concealment from radar. Compromises A Ferret armoured car with \\"Berlin camouflage\\" meant to hide it against that city's concrete buildings. Such terrain-specific patterns are rare. While camouflage tricks are in principle limitless, both cost and practical considerations limit the choice of methods and the time and effort devoted to camouflage. Paint and uniforms must also protect vehicles and soldiers from the elements. Units need to move, fire their weapons and perform other tasks to keep functional, some of which run counter to camouflage. Camouflage may be dropped altogether. Late in the Second World War, the USAAF abandoned camouflage paint for some aircraft to lure enemy fighters to attack, while in the Cold War, some aircraft similarly flew with polished metal skins, to reduce drag and weight, or to reduce vulnerability to radiation from nuclear weapons. No single camouflage pattern is effective in all terrains. The effectiveness of a pattern depends on contrast as well as colour tones. Strong contrasts which disrupt outlines are better suited for environments such as forests where the play of light and shade is prominent, while low contrasts are better suited to open terrain with little shading structure. Terrain-specific camouflage patterns, made to match the local terrain, may be more effective in that terrain than more general patterns. However, unlike an animal or a civilian hunter, military units may need to cross several terrain types like woodland, farmland and built up areas in a single day. While civilian hunting clothing may have almost photo- realistic depictions of tree bark or leaves (indeed, some such patterns are based on photographs), military camouflage is designed to work in a range of environments. With the cost of uniforms in particular being substantial, most armies operating globally have two separate full uniforms, one for woodland/jungle and one for desert and other dry terrain. An American attempt at a global camouflage pattern for all environments (the 2004 UCP) was however withdrawn after a few years of service. On the other end of the scale are terrain specific patterns like the \\"Berlin camo\\", applied to British vehicles operating in Berlin during the Cold War, where square fields of various gray shades was designed to hide vehicles against the mostly concrete architecture of post-war Berlin.  Other functions  Croatian army uniform (right) had by 2008 diverged from the former Yugoslavian army pattern, apparently for cultural reasons such as political identification. Camouflage patterns serve cultural functions alongside concealment. Apart from concealment, uniforms are also the primary means for soldiers to tell friends and enemies apart. The camouflage experts and evolutionary zoologists L. Talas, R. J. Baddeley and Innes Cuthill analyzed calibrated photographs of a series of NATO and Warsaw Pact uniform patterns and demonstrated that their evolution did not serve any known principles of military camouflage intended to provide concealment. Instead, when the Warsaw Pact was dissolved, the uniforms of the countries that began to favour the West politically started to converge on the colours and textures of NATO patterns. After the death of Marshal Tito and the breakup of what had been Yugoslavia, the camouflage patterns of the new nations changed, coming to resemble the camouflage patterns used by the armies of their neighbours. The authors note that military camouflage resembles animal coloration in having multiple simultaneous functions. Snow camouflage Finnish artillery during the Winter War, showing improvised snow camouflage made from bedsheets and whitewash Seasons may play a role in some regions. A dramatic change in colour and texture is created by seasonal snowy conditions in northern latitudes, necessitating repainting of vehicles and separate snow oversuits. The Eastern and northern European countries have a tradition for separate winter uniforms rather than oversuits. During the Second World War, the Waffen-SS went a step further, developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, as well as white winter oversuits. Movement While patterns can provide more effective crypsis than solid colour when the camouflaged object is stationary, any pattern, particularly one with high contrast, stands out when the object is moving. Jungle camouflage uniforms were issued during the Second World War, but both the British and American forces found that a simple green uniform provided better camouflage when soldiers were moving. After the war, most nations returned to a unicoloured uniform for their troops. Some nations, notably Austria and Israel, continue to use solid colour combat uniforms today. Similarly, while larger military aircraft traditionally had a disruptive pattern with a darker top over a lighter lower surface (a form of countershading), modern fast fighter aircraft often wear gray overall. Digital camouflage The Canadian Forces were the first army to issue pixellated digital camouflage for all units with their disruptively patterned CADPAT. Digital camouflage provides a disruptive effect through the use of pixellated patterns at a range of scales, meaning that the camouflage helps to defeat observation at a range of distances. Such patterns were first developed during the Second World War, when Johann Georg Otto Schick designed a number of patterns for the Waffen-SS, combining micro- and macro-patterns in one scheme. The German Army developed the idea further in the 1970s into Flecktarn, which combines smaller shapes with dithering; this softens the edges of the large scale pattern, making the underlying objects harder to discern.Pixellated shapes pre-date computer aided design by many years, already being used in Soviet Union experiments with camouflage patterns, such as \\"TTsMKK\\" developed in 1944 or 1945. In the 1970s, US Army officer Timothy R. O'Neill suggested that patterns consisting of square blocks of colour would provide effective camouflage. By 2000, O'Neill's idea was combined with patterns like the German Flecktarn to create pixellated patterns such as CADPAT and MARPAT. Battledress in digital camouflage patterns was first designed by the Canadian Forces. The \\"digital\\" refers to the coordinates of the pattern, which are digitally defined. The term is also used of computer generated patterns like the non-pixellated Multicam and the Italian fractal Vegetato pattern. Pixellation does not in itself contribute to the camouflaging effect. The pixellated style, however, simplifies design and eases printing on fabric. Non-visual A Swedish Visby class corvette, exhibiting both conventional visual camouflage and an anti-radar (stealth) design With the birth of radar and sonar and other means of detecting military hardware not depending on the human eye, came means of camouflaging against them. Collectively these are known as stealth technology. Aircraft and ships can be shaped to reflect radar impulses away from the sender, and covered with radar-absorbing materials, to reduce their radar signature. The use of heat- seeking missiles has also led to efforts to hide the heat signature of aircraft engines. Methods include exhaust ports shaped to mix hot exhaust gases with cold surrounding air, and placing the exhaust ports on the upper side of the airframe. Multi-spectral camouflage attempts to hide objects from detection methods such as infra-red, radar, and millimetre-wave imaging simultaneously. Auditory camouflage, at least in the form of noise reduction, is practised in various ways. The rubberized hull of military submarines absorbs sonar waves and can be seen as a form of auditory camouflage. Some modern helicopters are designed to be quiet. Combat uniforms are usually equipped with buttons rather than snap fasteners or velcro to reduce noise. Olfactory camouflage is said to be rare; examples include ghillie suits, special garments for military snipers made from strips of hessian cloth, which are sometimes treated with mud and even manure to give them an \\"earthy\\" smell to cover the smell of the sniper. Magnetic camouflage in the form of \\"degaussing\\" coils has been used since the Second World War to protect ships from magnetic mines and other weapons with magnetic sensors. Horizontal coils around the whole or parts of the ship generate magnetic fields to \\"cancel out\\" distortions to the earth's magnetic field created by the ship. History=Reconnaissance and riflemen Ship camouflage was occasionally used in ancient times. Vegetius wrote in the 4th century that \\"Venetian blue\\" (bluish- green, like the sea) was used for camouflage in the years 56‚Äì54 BC during the Gallic Wars, when Julius Caesar sent his scout ships to gather intelligence along the coast of Britain. The bluish-green scout ships carried sailors and marines dressed in the same colour. The emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, and the short range of weapons such as the musket, meant that recognition and cohesion were more important than camouflage in combat clothing well into the baroque period. The introduction of infantry weapons with longer range, especially the Baker rifle, opened up new roles which needed camouflaged clothing. In the colonial Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì1763), the rifle-armed Rogers' Rangers wore gray or green uniforms. John Graves Simcoe, one of the unit's later commanders, noted in 1784: 95th Rifles Regiment (1802‚Äì1816) reenactors in rifle green uniform The tradition was continued by British Rifle Regiments who adopted rifle green for the Napoleonic Wars. During the Peninsular War, Portugal fielded light infantry units known as Ca√ßadores, who wore brown-jackets which helped conceal them. The brown color was considered to be more adequate for a concealment in the landscape of most of Portuguese regions, in general more arid than the greener landscapes of Central and Northern Europe. The first introduction of drab general uniform was by the British Corps of Guides in India in 1848. Initially the drab uniform was specially imported from England, with one of the reasons being to \\"make them invisible in a land of dust\\". However, when a larger quantity was required the army improvised, using a local dye to produce uniform locally. This type of drab uniform soon became known as khaki (Urdu for dusty, soil-coloured) by the Indian soldiers, and was of a similar colour to a local dress of cotton coloured with the mazari palm.Oxford Dictionary The example was followed by other British units during the mutiny of 1857, dying their white drill uniforms to inconspicuous tones with mud, tea, coffee or coloured inks. The resulting hue varied from dark or slate grey through light brown to off-white, or sometimes even lavender. This improvised measure gradually became widespread among the troops stationed in India and North-West Frontier, and sometimes among the troops campaigning on the African continent. Rifle fire The Relief of Ladysmith by John Henry Frederick Bacon shows the khaki uniforms used by the British in the Second Boer War. While long range rifles became the standard weapon in the 1830s, armies were slow to adapt their tactics and uniforms, perhaps as a result of mainly fighting colonial wars against less well armed opponents. Not until the First Boer War of 1880/81 did a major European power meet an opponent well equipped with and well versed in the use of modern long range repeating firearms, forcing an immediate change in tactics and uniforms. Khaki-coloured uniform became standard service dress for both British and British Indian Army troops stationed in British India in 1885, and in 1896 khaki drill uniform was adopted by British Army for the service outside of Europe in general, but not until the Second Boer War, in 1902, did the entire British Army standardise on khaki (officially known as \\"drab\\") for Service Dress. The US military, who had blue-jacketed rifle units in the Civil War, were quick to follow the British, going khaki in the same year. Russia followed, partially, in 1908. The Italian Army used grigio-verde (\\"grey-green\\") in the Alps from 1906 and across the army from 1909. The Germans adopted feldgrau (\\"field grey\\") in 1910. By the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, France was the only major power to still field soldiers dressed in traditional conspicuous uniforms. The First World War 8 inch howitzer in WWI pattern, showing disruptive camouflage The First World War was the first full scale industrial conflict fought with modern firearms. The first attempt at disruptive camouflaged garment for the French army was proposed in 1914 by the painter Louis Guingot, but was refused by the army, which nevertheless kept a sample of the clothing. In collaboration with a Russian chemist friend, Guingot had developed a process of painting on weather-resistant fabric before the war and had registered a patent for it.Louis Guingot: Camouflage jacket, note from the Lorraine Museum, Palais des Ducs de Lorraine, France But the casualty rate on the Western Front forced the French to finally relinquish their blue coats and red trousers, adopting a grayish \\"horizon blue\\" uniform. The use of rapid firing machine guns and long range breech loading artillery quickly led to camouflaging of vehicles and positions. Artillery pieces were soon painted in contrasting bold colours to obscure their outlines. Another early trend was building observation trees, made of steel with bark camouflage. Such trees became popular with the British and French armies in 1916. The observation tree was invented by French painter Lucien-Victor Guirand de Sc√©vola, who led the French army's camouflage unit, the first of its kind in any army. He also invented painted canvas netting to hide machine gun positions, and this was quickly taken up for hiding equipment and gun positions from 1917, 7 million square yards being used by the end of the war. The First World War also saw the birth of aerial warfare, and with it the need not only to conceal positions and vehicles from being spotted from the air, but also the need to camouflage the aircraft themselves. In 1917, Germany started using a lozenge camouflage covering Central Powers aircraft, possibly the earliest printed camouflage. A similarly disruptive splinter pattern in earth tones, Buntfarbenanstrich 1918, was introduced for tanks in 1918, and was also used on the Stahlhelm (steel helmet), becoming the first use of a standardized camouflage pattern for soldiers. Camoufleurs Abbott Thayer's drawings in his 1902 patent for countershading ships In 1909 an American artist and amateur zoologist, Abbott Thayer published a book, Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom, which was widely read by military leaders, though his advocacy of countershading was unsuccessful, despite his patent for countershading submarines and surface ships. The earliest camouflage artists were members of the Post- Impressionist and Fauve schools of France. Contemporary artistic movements such as cubism, vorticism and impressionism also influenced the development of camouflage as they dealt with disrupting outlines, abstraction and colour theory.The French established a Section de Camouflage (Camouflage Department) at Amiens in 1915, headed by Lucien-Victor Guirand de Sc√©vola. His camoufleurs included the artists Jacques Villon, Andr√© Dunoyer de Segonzac, Charles Camoin and Andr√© Mare. Camouflage schemes of the First World War and Interwar periods that employed dazzle patterns were often described as \\"cubist\\" by commentators, and Picasso claimed with typical hyperbole \\"Yes, it is we who made it, that is cubism\\". Most of the artists employed as camoufleurs were traditional representative painters, not cubists, but de Sc√©vola claimed \\"In order to deform totally the aspect of the object, I had to employ the means that cubists use to represent it.\\" Other countries soon saw the advantage of camouflage, and established their own units of artists, designers and architects. The British established a Camouflage Section in late 1916 at Wimereux, and the U.S. followed suit with the New York Camouflage Society in April 1917, the official Company A of 40th Engineers in January 1918 and the Women's Reserve Camouflage Corps. The Italians set up the Laboratorio di mascheramento in 1917. By 1918 de Sc√©vola was in command of camouflage workshops with over 9,000 workers, not counting the camoufleurs working at the front itself. Norman Wilkinson who first proposed dazzle camouflage to the British military employed 5 male designers and 11 women artists, who by the end of the war had painted more than 2,300 vessels. French women were employed behind the lines of both the British and American armies, sewing netting to disguise equipment and designing apparel for soldiers to wear. From the Second World War Crusader tank masquerading as a truck in Operation Bertram Printed camouflage for shelter halves was introduced for the Italian and German armies in the interwar period, the \\"splotchy\\" M1929 Telo mimetico in Italy and the angular Splittermuster 31 in Germany. During the War, both patterns were used for paratrooper uniforms for their respective countries. The British soon followed suit with a brush-stroke type pattern for their paratrooper's Denison smock, and the Soviets introduced an \\"amoeba\\" pattern overgarment for their snipers. Hugh Cott's 1940 book Adaptive Coloration in Animals systematically covered the different forms of camouflage and mimicry by which animals protect themselves, and explicitly drew comparisons throughout with military camouflage: Both British and Soviet aircraft were given wave-type camouflage paintwork for their upper surfaces throughout the war, while American ones remained simple two-colour schemes (different upper and under sides) or even dispensed with camouflage altogether. Italian and some Japanese aircraft wore sprayed-on spotted patterns. German aircraft mostly used an angular splint- pattern camouflage, but Germany experimented with different schemes, particularly in the later stages of the war. They also experimented with various spray-on camouflage patterns for tanks and other vehicles, while Allied vehicles remained largely uni-coloured. As they had volunteered in the first World War, women sewed camouflage netting, organizing formalized groups for the work in Australia, Britain, New Zealand and the United States who took part as camoufleurs during the second war. A USAF Superfortress bomber in the typical bare metal finish of the period. The British Middle East Command Camouflage Directorate, consisting mainly of artists recruited into the Royal Engineers, developed the use of camouflage for large-scale military deception. Operations combined the disguise of actual installations, vehicles and stores with the simultaneous display of dummies, whether to draw fire or to give a false idea of the strength of forces or likely attack directions. In Operation Bertram for the decisive battle at El Alamein, a whole dummy armoured division was constructed, while real tanks were disguised as soft-skinned transport using \\"Sunshield\\" covers. The capabilities so developed were put to use not only in the western desert, but also in Europe as in the Operation Bodyguard deception for the Invasion of Normandy, and in the Pacific campaign, as in the Battle of Goodenough Island. The introduction of strategic bombing led to efforts to camouflage airfields and strategic production centres. This form of positional camouflage could be quite elaborate, and even include false houses and cars. With the threat from nuclear weapons in the post-war era such elaborate camouflage was no longer seen as useful, as a direct hit would not be necessary with strategic nuclear weapons to destroy infrastructure. The Soviet Union's doctrine of military deception defines the need for surprise through means including camouflage, based on experiences such as the Battle of Kursk where camouflage helped the Red Army to overwhelm a powerful enemy. Application=Uniforms U.S. Marine wearing newer digital pattern and Chilean Marine wearing older woodland pattern The role of uniform is not only to hide each soldier, but also to identify friend from foe. Issue of the \\"Frogskin\\" uniforms to US troops in Europe during the Second World War was halted as it was too often mistaken for the disruptively patterned German uniform worn by the Waffen-SS. Camouflage uniforms need to be made and distributed to a large number of soldiers. The design of camouflage uniforms therefore involves a tradeoff between camouflaging effect, recognizability, cost, and manufacturability. Armies facing service in different theatres may need several different camouflage uniforms. Separate issues of temperate/jungle and desert camouflage uniforms are common. Patterns can to some extent be adapted to different terrains by adding means of fastening pieces of vegetation to the uniform. Helmets often have netting covers; some jackets have small loops for the same purpose. Being able to find appropriate camouflage vegetation or in other ways modify the issued battle uniform to suit the local terrain is an important skill for infantry soldiers. Countries in boreal climates often need snow camouflage, either by having reversible uniforms or simple overgarments. Land vehicles M901 with MERDC winter verdant camouflage scheme The purpose of vehicle and equipment camouflage differs from personal camouflage in that the primary threat is aerial reconnaissance. The goal is to disrupt the characteristic shape of the vehicle, to reduce shine, and to make the vehicle difficult to identify even if it is spotted. Paint is the least effective measure, but forms a basis for other techniques. Military vehicles often become so dirty that pattern-painted camouflage is not visible, and although matt colours reduce shine, a wet vehicle can still be shiny, especially when viewed from above. Patterns are designed to make it more difficult to interpret shadows and shapes. The British Army adopted a disruptive scheme for vehicles operating in the stony desert of the North African Campaign and Greece, retrospectively known as the Caunter scheme. It used up to six colours applied with straight lines. \\"multi- spectral\\" camouflage system\\" fitted to a Marder armoured vehicle reduces visual, infrared and radar \\"signatures\\", and permits movement The British Army's Special Air Service used pink as the primary colour on its desert- camouflaged Land Rover Series IIA patrol vehicles, nicknamed Pink Panthers; the colour had been observed to be indistinguishable from sand at a distance. Nets can be effective at defeating visual observation. Traditional camouflage nets use a textile 'garnish' to generate an apparent texture with a depth of shadow created beneath it, and the effect can be reinforced with pieces of vegetation. Modern nets tend to be made of a continuous woven material, which is easier to deploy over a vehicle and lack the \\"windows\\" between patches of garnish of traditional nets. Some nets can remain in place while vehicles move. Simple nets are less effective in defeating radar and thermal sensors. Heavier, more durable \\"mobile camouflage systems\\", essentially conformal duvets with thermal and radar properties, provide a degree of concealment without the delay caused by having to spread nets around a vehicle. Active camouflage for vehicles, using heated or cooled Peltier plates to match the infrared background, has been prototyped in industry but has not yet been put into production. Ships British Admiralty dazzle camouflage of World War I Until the 20th century, naval weapons had a short range, so camouflage was unimportant for ships, and for the men on board them. Paint schemes were selected on the basis of ease of maintenance or aesthetics, typically buff upperworks (with polished brass fittings) and white or black hulls. Around the start of the 20th century, the increasing range of naval engagements, as demonstrated by the Battle of Tsushima, prompted the introduction of the first camouflage, in the form of some solid shade of gray overall, in the hope that ships would fade into the mist. Royal Norwegian Navy Skjold class patrol boat disruptively patterned for service close to the coast First and Second World War dazzle camouflage, pioneered by English artist Norman Wilkinson, was used not to make ships disappear, but to make them seem smaller or faster, to encourage misidentification by an enemy, and to make the ships harder to hit. In the Second World War, the Royal Canadian Navy trialled a form of active camouflage, counter-illumination, using diffused lighting to prevent ships from appearing as dark shapes against a brighter sky during the night. It reduced visibility by up to 70%, but was unreliable and never went into production. After the Second World War, the use of radar made camouflage generally less effective. However, camouflage may have helped to protect US warships from Vietnamese shore batteries using optical rangefinders. Coastal patrol boats such as those of the Norwegian, Swedish and Indonesian navies continue to use terrestrial style disruptively patterned camouflage. Aircraft Ukrainian Su-25 painted with earth colours above and sky blue below Aircraft camouflage faces the challenge that an aircraft's background varies widely, according to whether the observer is above or below the aircraft, and with the background, e.g. farmland or desert. Aircraft camouflage schemes have often consisted of a light colour underneath and darker colours above. Other camouflage schemes acknowledge that aircraft may be seen at any angle and against any background while in combat, so aircraft are painted all over with a disruptive pattern or a neutral colour such as gray. Catalina is painted white, but even so it appears dark against the sky. Second World War maritime patrol aircraft such as the Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boat were painted white, as aircraft generally appear dark against the sky (including at night), and hence are least visible when painted in as light a colour as possible. The problem of appearing dark against the sky was explored in the U.S. Navy's Yehudi lights project in 1943, using counter-illumination to raise the average brightness of a plane, when seen head-on, from a dark shape to the same as the sky. The experiments worked, enabling an aircraft to approach to within before being seen, whereas aircraft without the lights were noticed away. The higher speeds of modern aircraft, and the reliance on radar and missiles in air combat have reduced the value of visual camouflage, while increasing the value of electronic \\"stealth\\" measures. Modern paint is designed to absorb electromagnetic radiation used by radar, reducing the signature of the aircraft, and to limit the emission of infrared light used by heat seeking missiles to detect their target. Further advances in aircraft camouflage are being investigated in the field of active camouflage. In fashion and art Postcard of costumes at the 'Dazzle Ball' held by the Chelsea Arts Club, 1919, a peacetime reaction to war. Fashion and the \\"Dazzle Ball\\" The transfer of camouflage patterns from battle to exclusively civilian uses is not recent. Dazzle camouflage inspired a trend of dazzlesque patterns used on clothing in England, starting in 1919 with the \\"Dazzle Ball\\" held by Chelsea Arts Club. Those attending wore dazzle-patterned black and white clothing, influencing twentieth-century fashion and art via postcards (see illustration) and magazine articles. The Illustrated London News announced Camouflage in art Edward Wadsworth: Dazzle-ships in dry dock at Liverpool, 1919, National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario. While many artists helped to develop camouflage during and since World War I, the disparate sympathies of the two cultures restrained the use of \\"militaristic\\" forms other than in the work of war artists. Since the 1960s, several artists have exploited the symbolism of camouflage. For example, Andy Warhol's 1986 camouflage series was his last major work, including Camouflage Self-Portrait. Alain Jacquet created many camouflage works from 1961 to the 1970s. Ian Hamilton Finlay's 1973 Arcadia was a screenprint of a leafily-camouflaged tank, \\"an ironic parallel between this idea of a natural paradise and the camouflage patterns on a tank\\", as the Tate Collection describes it. Veruschka, the pseudonym of Vera von Lehndorff and Holger Tr√ºlzsch, created \\"Nature, Signs & Animals\\" and \\"Mimicry-Dress-Art\\" in 1970‚Äì1973. Thomas Hirschhorn made Utopia : One World, One War, One Army, One Dress in 2005. War protesters and fashionistas Camouflage patterned skirt as a fashion item In the US in the 1960s, military clothing became increasingly common (mostly olive drab rather than patterned camouflage); it was often found worn by anti-war protestors, initially within groups such as Vietnam Veterans Against the War but then increasingly widely as a symbol of political protest. Fashion often uses camouflage as inspiration ‚Äì attracted by the striking designs, the \\"patterned disorder\\" of camouflage, its symbolism (to be celebrated or subverted), and its versatility. Early designers include Marimekko (1960s), Jean-Charles de Castelbajac (1975‚Äì), Stephen Sprouse (using Warhol prints, 1987‚Äì1988), and Franco Moschino (1986), but it was not until the 1990s that camouflage became a significant and widespread facet of dress from streetwear to high-fashion labels ‚Äì especially the use of \\"faux- camouflage\\". Producers using camouflage in the 1990s and beyond include: John Galliano for Christian Dior, Marc Jacobs for Louis Vuitton, Comme des Gar√ßons, Chanel, Tommy Hilfiger, Dolce & Gabbana, Issey Miyake, Armani, Yves Saint- Laurent. Companies closely associated with camouflage patterns include 6876, A Bathing Ape, Stone Island, St√ºssy, Maharishi, mhi, Zoo York, Addict, and Girbaud, using and overprinting genuine military surplus fabric; others use camouflage patterns in bright colours such as pink or purple. Some, such as Emma Lundgren and St√ºssy, have created their own designs or integrated camouflage patterns with other symbols. Restrictions Some countries such as Barbados, Aruba, and other Caribbean nations have laws prohibiting camouflage clothing from being worn by non-military personnel, including tourists and children. Civilian possession of camouflage is still banned in Zimbabwe.

In particular chapter 2, Land Use and Design Maps shows Black Mountain as within Palo Alto. It is located on the border between Rancho San Antonio Open Space Preserve and Monte Bello Open Space Preserve, with the summit located in the former. Early Spanish explorers commonly named tree- or chaparral-covered summits which look black in the distance Loma Prieta, from the Spanish (loma-hill, prieta-dark). The Spanish also called the middle portion of the Santa Cruz Mountains the Sierra Morena meaning (morena-brunette, sierra-mountain range), extending from Half Moon Bay Road (California State Route 92) south to a gap at Lexington Reservoir, and which includes a summit called Sierra Morena. There are over 100 \\"Black Mountains\\" in California. History After extensive logging operations in the nineteenth century, Italian farmers and winemakers settled on the flanks of Montebello Ridge. Dairies in the Santa Cruz Mountains supplied much of the milk for San Francisco and the Peninsula. There was a large dairy near what is now the Montebello Open Space Preserve's main parking area on Page Mill Road, and cattle freely grazed the slopes of Black Mountain. Ranch buildings dotted the landscape. Oseo Perrone, a physician and immigrant from Mattarana, La Spezia Province, Italy, came to San Francisco in 1881, became interested in viticulture and purchased a large ranch at on Black Mountain in 1885 where he, and then his nephew of the same name, began production of Montebello Winery (now Ridge Vineyards) wine in 1892. George Morell, founding publisher of the Palo Alto Times and a Trustee of Stanford University, bought the Black Mountain Ranch on the mountain's summit in 1940. \\"Nature in the raw\\" is what led Mr. Morell to buy Black Mountain Ranch, according to his essay, \\"History of Black Mountain and Monte Bello Ridge,\\" written in 1959. Morell donated the land comprising the former Johnson, Winship, Morell ranches to Stanford University. In 1975, when the Black Mountain Ranch lands were acquired by the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District (MROSD) from Stanford, a commune of about 100 people, called \\"The Land\\", were evicted. The Land lived along the Canyon Trail from Page Mill Road to Indian Creek and built a variety of dwellings on platforms scattered amongst the oak woodlands and secluded canyons. A large ranch building was used as a central dining hall, and maintained a woodworking shop, a stained-glass workshop, and a food store selling bulk items. Commune members grew their own food in gardens, engaged in artistic pursuits, and gathered for holiday dinners and celebrations. Three creeks, each with an interesting history, spring from Black Mountain and flow to southwest San Francisco Bay. Stevens Creek originates in the Montebello Open Space Reserve on the west flank of the mountain and flows southeast then north to the Bay. Stevens Creek was originally called Arroyo San Jos√© de Cupertino by Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza, who camped along the creek on his expedition from Monterey to San Francisco. Anza completed the first overland route to San Francisco Bay when he and Father Pedro Font sighted the bay from a prominent knoll near the entry of Rancho San Antonio County Park. In Anza's diary on March 25, 1776, he states that he \\"arrived at the \\"Arroyo San Jos√© de Cupertino\\", which is useful only for travelers. Here we halted for the night, having come eight leagues in seven and a half hours. From this place we have seen at our right the estuary which runs from the port of San Francisco.\\" The Arroyo San Jos√© de Cupertino became Cupertino Creek, but was later re-named for Elijah Stephens (how his name was misspelled is unknown), a South Carolina-born blacksmith and trapper who settled on Cupertino Creek in 1848. Stephens renamed his property at the base of Black Mountain \\"Blackberry Farm\\". Stephens is notable for being the captain of the Stephens-Townsend-Murphy Party, the first wagon train to cross the Sierra Nevada (two years before the ill-fated Donner Party). Adobe Creek, originally named Yeguas Creek then San Antonio Creek, flows down Black Mountain's north flank to the Bay at the Palo Alto Flood Basin, just west of the Bay Trail on the levee separating it from Charleston Slough. The founders of Adobe Systems, a software company, lived next to Adobe Creek in Los Altos, and named their company after the creek. The upper watershed of Adobe Creek is protected by the Hidden Villa, a nonprofit educational organization founded by Frank and Josephine Duveneck, who purchased the land in 1924 and offered it as a gathering place for discussion, reflection, and incubation of social reform. Over the following decades, the Duvenecks established the first Hostel on the Pacific Coast (1937), the first multiracial summer camp (1945), and Hidden Villa's Environmental Education Program (1970). Permanente Creek, named R√≠o Permanente by early Spanish explorers because of its perennial flow, descends the east flank of Black Mountain then courses north to the Bay at the Mountain View Slough. Permanente Creek is also the namesake for Kaiser Permanente. Bess Kaiser and her spouse, industrialist Henry Kaiser, had a lodge on the creek's headwaters above the large Permanente Quarry and Cement Plant, and, in 1945, Bess felt that the name of their attractive and dependable stream would be a good name for their medical program at the shipyards. That medical program became Kaiser Permanente. Habitat and wildlife Rainfall on the summit of Black Mountain averages per year, much higher than the Santa Clara Valley which lies in its rain shadow. From its name, Black Mountain's dark summit was once covered with forest or chaparral instead of the current grasslands. Evidence of a large historic Coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) forest includes the \\"Skid Road Trail\\" in the Stevens Creek valley west of Black Mountain. Nineteenth century loggers used oxen to drag huge firs and smaller Tanbark oak (Lithocarpus densiflorus) trees along the trail. \\"Skids\\" were flat-topped logs doused with water to reduce friction. Although the summit today is mostly grassland and oak, the Stevens Creek valley contains the last remaining Douglas-fir forest in Santa Clara County. Until the 1975 conversion of Black Mountain to open space by the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District, forest succession was inhibited by grazing dairy cattle. Today, saplings sown by large remnant Douglas-fir trees are distributed widely over the mountain in an example of forest succession. The Monte Bello ridge's grasslands include California poppy, checker mallow, purple owl's-clover, bluedicks, and blue-eyed grass. Large mammals on the ridge include coyotes, bobcats, deer, badgers and mountain lions. Common raptors include red-tailed hawks, northern harriers, and American kestrels, and less commonly, rough-legged hawks, prairie falcons, merlins, and golden eagles can be seen during fall and spring migratory seasons. Monte Bello hosts a wide variety of owl species, including great horned, barn, pygmy, long- eared, western screech, and northern saw-whet. Secretive Virginia rails (Rallus limicola) inhabit the sag pond at the beginning of the Canyon Trail. Geology The geology of the mountain is complex and has features different from the rest of the Santa Cruz Mountains. The San Andreas Fault runs along the base of Monte Bello Ridge, of which Black Mountain is the highest point at . It is the second highest summit on the Sierra Morena portion of the Santa Cruz Mountains, after Castle Rock at . Everything west of the San Andreas fault rides to the northwest on the Pacific Plate's Salinian Block, which is made up largely of Mesozoic-era granitic rocks, similar to those of the Sierra Nevada, and overlain by more recent sedimentary rocks of marine origin. East of the fault, the North American Plate rides to the southeast, and here the bedrock is the Franciscan Assemblage, made up of rocks common in the Bay Area such as sandstone, basalt, and metamorphics. On the very summit of Black Mountain are Calera limestone rocks which are relatively unique in the Bay Area. Microfossils in the limestone deposits suggest that the mountain originated as a seamount at 22 degrees north in the tropical Pacific about 100 million years ago and was transported to Los Altos by the Pacific Plate. These rocks occur as jagged gray boulders and outcrops just southwest of the radio towers on the summit, as well as in the large Permanente Quarry downhill east of the preserve where the limestone is mined to produce cement. Calera is the Spanish word for 'limekiln', reflecting how limestone was burned historically to produce lime, a key ingredient for mortar. The summit is also unusual as it is higher than the Skyline Ridge to the west, allowing a view of the ocean on a clear day. Small quantities of gold and mercury have been mined from the mountain. Legend has it that a lone Indian eked out a living on gold extracted from a \\"lost mine\\". The location has since been lost. Black Mountain today View from the highest point of the trail connecting Montebello Road and Page Mill Road. The mountain is a popular destination for hikers and mountain bikers. The summit is most easily accessed from the Monte Bello parking area on Page Mill Road, via a route from about . The summit can also be reached from the northwestern entrance of Rancho San Antonio on Rhus Ridge Road in Los Altos Hills by a route from about . This strenuous hike is not recommended for novice or beginning hikers. The summit can also be reached by Montebello Road which begins near the Stevens Creek Reservoir. This maintained road can be followed most of the way to the summit. It has an average grade of 15% and while it is open to motor vehicles the traffic is comparatively light. On the summit there are two broadcasting stations. One is a private radio station owned by Stanford University, and the other is owned by the Federal Aviation Administration. There are several wineries along Montebello Road, including Ridge Vineyards, Fellom Ranch Vineyards and Picchetti Brothers Winery.

According to United States Geological Survey maps of the area, the tunnel does not enter Virginia. It is one of only two mountain vehicular tunnels in the United States that cross a state line, the other being the East River Mountain Tunnel on Interstate 77 and U.S. Route 52 between Virginia and West Virginia. Overview The tunnels consist of two tubes, each 4,600 feet (1,402 m) long. Each tube carries two lanes of traffic. An \\"illumination zone\\" is included at each portal to allow drivers' vision to adjust to the lower light level in the tunnel. The speed limit in the tunnel is 45 mph (70 km/h); lane changes are prohibited. Trucks carrying Class 1 hazardous cargo (i.e., explosives) are prohibited from using the tunnels, while other hazardous cargo and wide loads are directed to a pull-off area and sent through one at a time with an escort. The overall construction cost, including the four-lane approach roads at both portals, was $280 million. The tunnel replaced a 2.3-mile (3.7 km) stretch of U.S. 25E between Middlesboro, Kentucky and Cumberland Gap, Tennessee that became known as \\"Massacre Mountain\\" due to the large number of travelers killed on the twisting mountain road over the Cumberland Gap pass. Project history Even in the late 1970s, road traffic through the park had increased to the point of being unmanageable, and the project to replace the surface road began in 1980. However, construction did not begin until 1991. Early on, it was decided that widening the existing surface road to four lanes would adversely affect the historically sensitive areas in the park, making a tunnel the only viable choice. As a part of the plan, the existing road through Cumberland Gap has been removed and restored as a wagon path similar to that used by early 19th-century travelers. Construction was administered by the Eastern Federal Lands Highway Division of the Federal Highway Administration for the National Park Service, with funding provided by both agencies as well as the states of Kentucky and Tennessee. While the project was in the planning phases, Kentucky and Tennessee both began widening their portions of U.S. 25E leading to Cumberland Gap to four lanes. Construction inspection, project management and engineering services were administered by Vaughn & Melton Consulting Engineers. The first step in construction was the boring of a pilot tunnel underneath the mountain, which revealed some unexpected construction challenges. The boring revealed underground springs and streams that would result in leakage of 450 gallons (1,700 L) per minute of water into the tunnel, regardless of outside weather conditions. To eliminate leakage into the tunnel, the tubes were lined with a thick PVC layer. Construction of the actual tubes began on June 21, 1991. Excavation continued simultaneously from both sides, and the tunnels were joined on July 9, 1992. The tunnels opened to traffic on October 18, 1996. The southbound tunnel was briefly closed in 2006-2007 for construction. In 2012, the tunnel was partially closed to replace some of the crushed limestone road base with granite.

It provided service from Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and St. Ignace, Michigan, westward through Marquette, Michigan to Superior, Wisconsin, and Duluth, Minnesota. A branchline stretched northward from Nestoria, Michigan up to the Keweenaw Peninsula and terminating at Houghton, Michigan, with two branches extending further to Calumet, Michigan and Lake Linden, Michigan. The first predecessor of the DSS&A; began operations in 1855. The railroad fell under the control of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) in 1888 and was operated from 1888 until 1960 as an independently nameplated subsidiary of the CPR. In 1949, a reorganization of the DSS&A; took place, creating new heralds and designating the company a railroad instead of a railway. In 1961, the DSS&A; was folded into the CPR-controlled Soo Line Railroad. Since 2001, the remaining operating trackage of the former DSS&A; has been operated by the Canadian National Railway (CN). Short stretches of original DSS&A; trackage are still operated between Trout Lake and Munising Junction, from Ishpeming to Baraga, and between White Pine and Marengo Junction. Independent railroad DSSA locomotive, circa 1887 The development in the 1850s of hematite iron ore mines in the Upper Peninsula hills above Marquette encouraged the development of numerous railroad plans for spur lines and connecting routes between mines, local boom towns, and the shores of the Great Lakes. While most of the Upper Peninsula's iron ore and Keweenaw copper was shipped to the rest of the United States by lake boat, the inability of water-based shippers to offer service to northern Michigan in winter encouraged railroad promoters to launch numerous plans for lines in the Upper Peninsula. A preserved DSS&A; boxcar at the Mid-Continent Railway Museum, North Freedom, Wisconsin. By the 1870s, a maze of corporate charters and tiny stub lines had been created or built in the central Upper Peninsula, primarily to carry iron or copper ore from the mines down to smelters and docks on the shores of Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. In 1879-81, venture capitalists led the construction of the Detroit, Mackinac & Marquette (DM&M;), a standard- gauge mainline from St. Ignace, on the Straits of Mackinac, to Marquette on Lake Superior. The roadbed included a surveyor-straight east-west section, the ancestor of today's \\"Seney stretch\\". Although the state of Michigan granted the DM&M; more than 1.3 million acres (5,300 km¬≤) of state land, almost 9000 acres-per-mile (23 km¬≤/km) as a construction subsidy, by 1886 the new DM&M; went into receivership. The DM&M; was reorganized by venture capitalist James McMillan of Detroit, who led the rapid consolidation of the DM&M; and many of the UP's smaller railroads during the early 1880s. The new Duluth, South Shore & Atlantic went into operation as a merger of these lines in December 1886. Canadian control The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), a transcontinental line, took control of the Duluth, South Shore & Atlantic in 1888. In 1892-94, CPR funds financed the construction of the DSS&A; westward from the Keweenaw Peninsula to Duluth. During the 1890s, the timber industry reached the peak of its operations on the Lake Superior shoreline properties adjacent to the DSS&A;'s new mainline, with irreplaceable old-growth white pines falling to the lumbermen's saws and axes. After white pines were exhausted, local cutters began to turn to high-quality hardwoods such as sugar maple, and then to pulpwoods such as paper birch and aspen. At the height of the railroad's operations in 1911, the DSS&A; operated of track, of which were main line and were branch lines and trackage rights. The railroad operated 3,121 pieces of rolling stock, including 82 locomotives, 67 passenger cars, 35 cabooses, and 2,957 freight cars. In 1913 the DSS&A;'s freight operations peaked at almost 1 million short tons (900,000 metric tons), of which more than half were forest products. In the late 1910s, timber yields began to decline all over the Upper Peninsula. This was a blow from which the DSS&A; could not recover as an independent nameplate. Its story from 1920 onwards was that of the American railway industry as a whole, with negative factors intensified by unfavorable local business conditions in northern Michigan. In 1957, the State of Michigan opened the Mackinac Bridge, a long suspension bridge carrying an all-weather hard road across the Straits of Mackinac into the Upper Peninsula. The DSS&A; responded by ending its remaining passenger rail service in January 1958. In 1961, its Canadian owners merged it with the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie, and the DSS&A; became part of the Soo Line. Nicknames and challenges The DSS&A;'s own \\"official\\" nickname for itself was \\"South Shore\\", referring to the railroad line's route along the south shore of Lake Superior. However, the DSS&A;'s allegedly poor-quality service throughout much of the 20th century inspired angry customers to impose several uncomplimentary backronyms on the struggling railroad, such as \\"Dead Slow Service & Agony\\" and \\"Damn Slow, Shabby Affair\\". Dissatisfied workers, meanwhile, suggested that the railroad's initials stood for \\"Damn Small Salary & Abuse\\". The DSS&A;'s thinly settled service area made it difficult for the railroad to raise adequate revenue to maintain its trackage in good condition, especially in winter. The region served by the railroad receives more snowfall in one year than other sections of the United States east of the Rockies receive in several years combined. From 1957 through 2005, the average snowfall on the Keweenaw Peninsula has been per year. Every winter, the DSS&A; had to plow this snow off its tracks.

Green Run hosts a very diverse student population many of which come from the large concentration of military families that have moved into the area within the past couple of decades. The school was the largest high school in Virginia when it opened in 1979, with 247,000 feet of space. When it was first opened, it had the largest enrollment in the state. Due to changing demographics and the ensuing addition of new schools, the school is now one of the smallest in Virginia Beach when it comes to student body population. Construction cost totaled $11.4 million. The current head principal of the school is Dr. Christopher Todd Tarkenton. In April 2010, it was announced that Green Run High School was one of three high schools nationwide to be awarded the 2010 College Board Inspiration Award winners for improving their academic environments and helping under-served students achieve equitable access to higher education. The prize includes a $25,000 award presented by The College Board. College Board Press Release, April 2010 On July 13, 2012, President Obama visited Green Run as part of his Presidential Campaign. In 2016, Green Run's high school NJROTC chapter won second place in the National High School NJROTC SOP & Drill Competition, and in 2017, Green Run's NJROTC won first place of all the high schools in the competition. In September 2013, Green Run Collegiate High School was established as a charter school with an International Baccalaureate program. Green Run Collegiate shares space with Green Run High School.

One circle west to Australia, then south and back to Latin America. Further north, water moves east to Central America, and then joins a larger movement further north, which loops south, west, north, and east between North America and Japan. Two smaller loops circle in the eastern and central North Pacific. The Great Pacific garbage patch, also described as the Pacific trash vortex, is a gyre of marine debris particles in the central North Pacific Ocean. It is located roughly from 135¬∞W to 155¬∞W and 35¬∞N to 42¬∞N.See the relevant sections below for specific references concerning the discovery and history of the patch. A general overview is provided in Dautel, Susan L. \\"Transoceanic Trash: International and United States Strategies for the Great Pacific Garbage Patch\\", 3 Golden Gate U. Envtl. L.J. 181 (2007) The collection of plastic and floating trash originates from the Pacific Rim, including countries in Asia, North America, and South America. The gyre is divided into two areas, the \\"Eastern Garbage Patch\\" between Hawaii and California, and the \\"Western Garbage Patch\\" extending eastward from Japan to the Hawaiian Islands. An ocean current about 6,000 miles long, referred to as the Subtropical Convergence Zone, connects the two patches, which extend over an indeterminate area of the widely varying range, depending on the degree of plastic concentration used to define the affected area. The vortex is characterized by exceptionally high relative pelagic concentrations of plastic, chemical sludge, wood pulp, and other debris trapped by the currents of the North Pacific Gyre.For this and what follows, see Moore (2004) and Moore (2009), which includes photographs taken from the patch. It is estimated that 1.15 to 2.41 million tonnes of plastic are entering the ocean each year from rivers. More than half of this plastic is less dense than the water, meaning that it will not sink once it encounters the sea. Despite the common public perception of the patch existing as giant islands of floating garbage, its low density (4 particles per cubic meter) prevents detection by satellite imagery, or even by casual boaters or divers in the area. This is because the patch is a widely dispersed area consisting primarily of suspended \\"fingernail-sized or smaller bits of plastic\\", often microscopic, particles in the upper water column known as microplastics. Researchers from The Ocean Cleanup project claimed that the patch covers 1.6 million square kilometers. The plastic concentration is estimated to be up to 100 kilograms per square kilometer in the center, going down to 10 kilograms per square kilometer in the outer parts of the patch. An estimated 87,000 metric tons of plastic inhabit the patch, totaling 1.8 trillion pieces. 92% of the mass in the patch comes from objects larger than 0.5 centimeters, while 94% of the total objects are represented by microplastics. Some of the plastic in the patch is over 50 years old, and includes items (and fragments of items) such as \\"plastic lighters, toothbrushes, water bottles, pens, baby bottles, cell phones, plastic bags, and nurdles.\\" It is estimated that approximately \\"100 million tons of plastic are generated [globally] each year\\", and about 10% of that plastic ends up in the oceans. The United Nations Environmental Program recently estimated that \\"for every square mile of ocean\\" there are about \\"46,000 pieces of plastic.\\" The small fibers of wood pulp found throughout the patch are \\"believed to originate from the thousands of tons of toilet paper flushed into the oceans daily.\\" The patch is believed to have increased \\"10-fold each decade\\" since 1945. Research indicates that the patch is rapidly accumulating. A similar patch of floating plastic debris is found in the Atlantic Ocean, called the North Atlantic garbage patch. History alt=Map showing the oceans' five major gyres The patch was described in a 1988 paper published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The description was based on research by several Alaska-based researchers in 1988 who measured neustonic plastic in the North Pacific Ocean. Researchers found relatively high concentrations of marine debris accumulating in regions governed by ocean currents. Extrapolating from findings in the Sea of Japan, the researchers hypothesized that similar conditions would occur in other parts of the Pacific where prevailing currents were favorable to the creation of relatively stable waters. They specifically indicated the North Pacific Gyre.\\"After entering the ocean, however, neuston plastic is redistributed by currents and winds. For example, plastic entering the ocean in Korea is moved eastward by the Subarctic Current (in Subarctic Water) and the Kuroshio (in Transitional Water, Kawai 1972; Favorite et al. 1976; Nagata et al. 1986). In this way, the plastic is transported from high-density areas to low-density areas. In addition to this eastward movement, Ekman stress from winds tends to move surface waters from the subarctic and the subtropics toward the Transitional Water mass as a whole (see Roden 1970: fig. 5). Because of the convergent nature of this Ekman flow, densities tend to be high in Transitional Water. Also, the generally convergent nature of water in the North Pacific Central Gyre (Masuzawa 1972) should result in high densities there also.\\" (Day, et al. 1988, p. 261) (Emphasis added) Charles J. Moore, returning home through the North Pacific Gyre after competing in the Transpacific Yacht Race in 1997, claimed to have come upon an enormous stretch of floating debris. Moore alerted the oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer, who subsequently dubbed the region the \\"Eastern Garbage Patch\\" (EGP). The area is frequently featured in media reports as an exceptional example of marine pollution. The JUNK Raft Project was a 2008 trans-Pacific sailing voyage made to highlight the plastic in the patch, organized by the Algalita Marine Research Foundation. In 2009, two project vessels from Project Kaisei,/ Ocean Voyages Institute; the New Horizon and the Kaisei, embarked on a voyage to research the patch and determine the feasibility of commercial scale collection and recycling. The Scripps Institute of Oceanography's 2009 SEAPLEX expedition in part funded by Ocean Voyages Institute/Project Kaisei also researched the patch. Researchers were also looking at the impact of plastic on mesopelagic fish, such as lanternfish. Alt URL In 2010, Ocean Voyages Institute conducted a 30-day expedition in the gyre which continued the science from the 2009 expeditions and tested prototype cleanup devices. in July & Aug 2012 Ocean Voyages Institute conducted a voyage from San Francisco to the Eastern limits of the North Pacific Gyre north, (ultimately ending in Richmond British Columbia) and then made a return voyage which also visited the Gyre. The focus on this expedition was surveying the extent of tsunami debris from the Japanese earthquake-tsunami. Mitigation At TEDxDelft2012, Boyan Slat unveiled a concept for removing large amounts of marine debris from oceanic gyres. Calling his project The Ocean Cleanup, he proposed to use surface currents to let debris drift to collection platforms. Operating costs would be relatively modest and the operation would be so efficient that it might even be profitable. The concept makes use of floating booms that divert rather than catch the debris. This avoids bycatch, while collecting even the smallest particles. According to Slat's calculations, a gyre could be cleaned up in five years' time, amounting to at least 7.25 million tons of plastic across all gyres. He also advocated \\"radical plastic pollution prevention methods\\" to prevent gyres from reforming. In 2015, The Ocean Cleanup project was a category winner in the Design Museum's 2015 Designs of the Year awards. A fleet of 30 vessels, including a 32-metre (105-foot) mothership, took part in a month-long voyage to determine how much plastic is present using trawls and aerial surveys. The 2012 Algalita/5 Gyres Asia Pacific Expedition began in the Marshall Islands on 1 May, investigated the patch, collecting samples for the 5 Gyres Institute, Algalita Marine Research Foundation, and several other institutions, including NOAA, Scripps, IPRC and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. In 2012, the Sea Education Association (SEA) conducted research expeditions in the gyre. One hundred and eighteen net tows were conducted and nearly 70,000 pieces of plastic were counted. In 2012, researchers Goldstein, Rosenberg and Cheng found that microplastic concentrations in the gyre had increased by two orders of magnitude in the prior four decades. On 11 April 2013, artist Maria Cristina Finucci founded The Garbage Patch State at UNESCO ‚Äì Paris in front of Director General Irina Bokova. On 9 September 2018, the first collection system was deployed to the gyre to begin the collection task. This initial trial run of the Ocean Cleanup Project started towing its \\"Ocean Cleanup System 001\\" from San Francisco to a trial site some 240 nautical miles (260 miles) away. In June 2019, Ocean Voyages Institute, the same organization behind the 2009, 2010 & 2012 expeditions, conducted a cleanup in the gyre and removed over 84,000 pounds of polymer nets and consumer plastic trash from the ocean. In May/June 2020, Ocean Voyages Institute conducted a cleanup expedition in the Gyre which removed over 170 tons (340,000 pounds) of consumer plastics and ghostnets from the ocean Utilizing custom designed GPS satellite trackers which are deployed by vessels of opportunity, Ocean Voyages Institute is able to accurately track and send cleanup vessels to remove ghostnets. The GPS Tracker technology is being combined with satellite imagery increasing the ability to locate plastic trash and ghostnets in real time via satellite imagery which will greatly increase cleanup capacity and efficiency. Sources of the plastic In 2015, a study published in the journal Science sought to discover where exactly all of this garbage is coming from. According to the researchers, the discarded plastics and other debris floats eastward out of countries in Asia from six primary sources: China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Thailand. In fact, the Ocean Conservancy reported that China, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam dump more plastic in the sea than all other countries combined. China alone is responsible for 30% of worldwide plastic ocean pollution. Efforts to slow land generated debris and consequent marine debris accumulations have been undertaken by the Coastal Conservancy, Earth Day, and World Cleanup Day. According to National Geographic, \\"About 54 percent of the debris in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch comes from land-based activities in North America and Asia. The remaining 20 percent of debris in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch comes from boaters, offshore oil rigs, and large cargo ships that dump or lose debris directly into the water. The majority of this debris‚Äîabout 705,000 tons‚Äîis fishing nets.\\" In September 2019, when research revealed that much ocean plastic pollution comes from Chinese cargo ships, an Ocean Cleanup spokesperson said: \\"Everyone talks about saving the oceans by stopping using plastic bags, straws and single-use packaging. That's important, but when we head out on the ocean, that's not necessarily what we find.\\" Constitution alt=Map of gyres centered near the south pole (click to enlarge) The Great Pacific garbage patch formed gradually as a result of ocean or marine pollution gathered by ocean currents.For this and what follows, see For gyres generally, see It occupies a relatively stationary region of the North Pacific Ocean bounded by the North Pacific Gyre in the horse latitudes. The gyre's rotational pattern draws in waste material from across the North Pacific, incorporating coastal waters off North America and Japan. As the material is captured in the currents, wind-driven surface currents gradually move debris toward the center, trapping it. In a 2014 study researchers sampled 1571 locations throughout the world's oceans, and determined that discarded fishing gear such as buoys, lines and nets accounted for more than 60% of the mass of plastic marine debris. According to a 2011 EPA report, \\"The primary source of marine debris is the improper waste disposal or management of trash and manufacturing products, including plastics (e.g., littering, illegal dumping) ... Debris is generated on land at marinas, ports, rivers, harbors, docks, and storm drains. Debris is generated at sea from fishing vessels, stationary platforms, and cargo ships.\\" Constituents range in size from miles-long abandoned fishing nets to micro-pellets used in cosmetics and abrasive cleaners. A computer model predicts that a hypothetical piece of debris from the U.S. west coast would head for Asia, and return to the U.S. in six years; debris from the east coast of Asia would reach the U.S. in a year or less. While microplastics make up 94% of the estimated 1.8 trillion plastic pieces, they amount to only 8% of the 79,000 metric tons of plastic there, with most of the rest coming from the fishing industry. A 2017 study concluded that of the 9.1 billion tons of plastic produced since 1950, close to 7 billion tons are no longer in use. The authors estimate that 9% was recycled, 12% was incinerated, and the remaining 5.5 billion tons remains in the oceans and land. Size estimates Visualisation showing how mass accumulates in gyres.The size of the patch is indefinite, as is the precise distribution of debris because large items are uncommon. Most debris consists of small plastic particles suspended at or just below the surface, evading detection by aircraft or satellite. Instead, the size of the patch is determined by sampling. Estimates of size range from (about the size of Texas) to more than (about the size of Russia). Such estimates, however, are conjectural given the complexities of sampling and the need to assess findings against other areas. Further, although the size of the patch is determined by a higher-than-normal degree of concentration of pelagic debris, there is no standard for determining the boundary between \\"normal\\" and \\"elevated\\" levels of pollutants to provide a firm estimate of the affected area. Pacific Ocean currents have created 3 \\"islands\\" of debris. In August 2009, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography/Project Kaisei SEAPLEX survey mission of the Gyre found that plastic debris was present in 100 consecutive samples taken at varying depths and net sizes along a path of through the patch. The survey found that, although the patch contains large pieces, it is on the whole made up of smaller items that increase in concentration toward the gyre's centre, and these 'confetti-like' pieces that are visible just beneath the surface suggests the affected area may be much smaller. 2009 data collected from Pacific albatross populations suggest the presence of two distinct debris zones. In March 2018, The Ocean Cleanup published a paper summarizing their findings from the Mega- (2015) and Aerial Expedition (2016). In 2015, the organization crossed the Great Pacific garbage patch with 30 vessels, to make observations and take samples with 652 survey nets. They collected a total of 1.2 million pieces, which they counted and categorized into their respective size classes. In order to also account for the larger, but more rare debris, they also overflew the patch in 2016 with a C-130 Hercules aircraft, equipped with LiDAR sensors. The findings from the two expeditions, found that the patch covers 1.6 million square kilometers with a concentration of 10‚Äì100 kg per square kilometer. They estimate an 80,000 metric tons in the patch, with 1.8 trillion plastic pieces, out of which 92% of the mass is to be found in objects larger than 0.5 centimeters. NOAA stated: Photodegradation of plastics Washed-up plastic waste on a beach in Singapore The patch is one of several oceanic regions where researchers have studied the effects and impact of plastic photodegradation in the neustonic layer of water. Unlike organic debris, which biodegrades, plastic disintegrates into ever smaller pieces while remaining a polymer (without changing chemically). This process continues down to the molecular level. Some plastics decompose within a year of entering the water, releasing potentially toxic chemicals such as bisphenol A, PCBs and derivatives of polystyrene. As the plastic flotsam photodegrades into smaller and smaller pieces, it concentrates in the upper water column. As it disintegrates, the pieces become small enough to be ingested by aquatic organisms that reside near the ocean's surface. Plastic may become concentrated in neuston, thereby entering the food chain. Disintegration means that much of the plastic is too small to be seen. In a 2001 study, researchers found concentrations of plastic particles at 334,721 pieces per km2 with a mean mass of 5.1 kg (11.3 lbs) per km2, in the neuston. The overall concentration of plastics was seven times greater than the concentration of zooplankton in many of the sampled areas. Samples collected deeper in the water column found much lower concentrations of plastic particles (primarily monofilament fishing line pieces). Effect on marine life and humans NOAA's marine debris removal in 2014 The United Nations Ocean Conference estimated that the oceans might contain more weight in plastics than fish by the year 2050. Some long-lasting plastics end up in the stomachs of marine animals. Plastic attracts seabirds and fish. When marine life consumes plastic allowing it to enter the food chain, this can lead to greater problems when species that have consumed plastic are then eaten by other predators. Animals can also become trapped in plastic nets and rings, which can cause death. Plastic pollution affects at least 700 marine species, including sea turtles, seals and sea lions, seabirds, fish, and whales and dolphins. Cetaceans have been sighted within the patch, which poses entanglement and ingestion risks to animals using the Great Pacific garbage patch as a migration corridor or core habitat. Affected species include sea turtles and the black-footed albatross. Midway Atoll receives substantial amounts of marine debris from the patch.  Direct harm to species  Of the 1.5 million Laysan albatrosses that inhabit Midway Atoll, nearly all are likely to have plastic in their gastrointestinal tract. Approximately one-third of their chicks die, and many of those deaths are from plastic unwittingly fed to them by their parents. Twenty tons of plastic debris washes up on Midway every year with five tons ending up in the bellies of albatross chicks. Fish and whales may also mistake the plastic as a food source. Indirect harm via the food chain On the microscopic level, debris can absorb organic pollutants from seawater, including PCBs, DDT and PAHs. Aside from toxic effects, some of these are mistaken by the endocrine system as estradiol, disrupting hormone levels in affected animals. These toxin-containing plastic pieces are also eaten by jellyfish, which are then eaten by fish and then by humans. Spreading invasive species Marine plastics facilitate the spread of invasive species that attach to floating plastic in one region and drift long distances to colonize other ecosystems. Debris affects at least 267 species worldwide. Increasing microplastic concentrations have released the insect Halobates sericeus from substrate limitation. A positive correlation between H. sericeus and microplastic was observed, along with increasing H. sericeus egg densities.

It is primarily used for ice hockey and is the home arena of HC Davos. It holds 7,080 people, of which 3,280 are seated. Every year the Spengler Cup is played in this arena. Major renovation of the arena started at the conclusion of the 2017-18 season to upgrade most of the stands and the concourse. The seating capacity will not be increased and the total cost should be around CHF 27 million.https://www.planetehockey.com/news-des-surcouts-a-prevoir-sur-la- patinoire-de-davos,90163.html Construction began in 2018 and is expected to be completed by 2021. https://www.nau.ch/news/schweiz/davoser-eisstadion-wird- saniert-65313998 Speed skating The open natural ice rink beside the arena, Eisstadion Davos, was in the past (up until 1997) the venue for many international speed skating events and many speed skating world records have been broken here. It still continues to be used for Swiss Championships in speed skating. It is an outdoor, natural, ice rink (as opposed to ice rinks that are indoor and/or use artificial ice) and lies 1,560 metres (almost one mile) above sea level. For the high velocities achieved in speed skating, high altitudes are favorable due to lower air drag, and since the ice conditions produced were also often very favorable, many World Records were set in Davos, beginning with Peder √òstlund who set four records in 1898. The arena also had a reputation for variable conditions, the sun or warm winds could play havoc with ice conditions throughout a championship. Bandy Bandy has also been played at the Eisstadion. Apart from local games, the 1913 European Bandy Championships was held at the site and a four nation bandy tournament was held here in 2014. Ice hockey At the beginning of the 20th century HC Davos played home games at an outdoor ice rink. The first attempt to cover the ice rink came around 1970. Soon after work began on the wooden enclosure, the project was stopped because of a lack of funds. In 1979 HC Davos, qualified for the Nationalliga A and a covered rink was necessary. Construction finished on the wooden structure, allowing the team to participate in the 1979/80 season. It was not until the 1981/82 season that the arena was then \\"closed\\" by glass panes. In 1998 the west tribune was renovated and instead of a big standing area, a two-level section with plastic seats was built. At that time the arena could hold up to 7,680 people. In summer 2005 a new, modern, tribune was built, which included the restaurant ‚ÄúNordside‚Äù, VIP rooms, a sector for sponsors, and new changing rooms were built in the northern sector. Capacity was subsequently reduced by the new construction to 7,080 people. The renovations continued in 2006 with small investments in the security of the southern and eastern tribune and screens for advertising. In January 2007 the indoor ice-hockey rink was renamed \\"Vaillant Arena\\" after the Vaillant Group paid three million Swiss francs to help fund future renovations.

His music is often classified as R&B;, jazz fusion or worship music. Biography Born and raised in Athlone, Cape Town, South Africa, during Apartheid, Butler started singing and playing acoustic guitar as a child. Racial segregation and poverty during Apartheid has been the subject of many of his records. His first single was the first by a black artist played by white radio stations in the racially segregated South Africa and earned a Sarie Award, South Africa's equivalent to the Grammy Awards. He began touring at the age of seven when he joined a travelling stage show, and was later signed up to perform on a string of hit recordings, turning him into a local teen idol. In 1975 his cover of \\"Please Stay (song)\\" by The Drifters reached number 2 in South Africa. The same year his cover of \\"I Love How You Love Me\\" by The Paris Sisters reached number 4. \\"I'll be Home\\" reached number 16 in 1976. In 1978 he found the inspiration and encouragement to begin expressing himself as a composer and songwriter when he joined Cape Town's best known jazz/rock outfit, Pacific Express. Two albums were recorded with the Express personnel, and some Pacific Express songs were later released on the 1988 7th Avenue album. All three releases were issued by Mountain Records. Butler was signed to CCP Records, a predecessor to Jive Records in 1977. He left the label to join Mountain Records after a few years. The manager of Mountain Records, Paddy Lee-Thorp was also Butler's manager and in the early 1980s they signed Jonathan to Jive Records and he moved to the United Kingdom, where he remained for seventeen years. His international breakthrough came in 1987 with his Grammy-nominated hit single, \\"Lies\\" which reached #27 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart, and his cover version of the Staple Singers song \\"If You're Ready (Come Go with Me)\\", which he performed with Ruby Turner. His single \\"Lies\\", also reached the UK Official Singles Chart, peaking at number 18, spending 12 weeks, in total, in the Top 100. In 2001, Butler was featured in a compilation album that was a jazz tribute to Bob Marley produced by Lee Ritenour, A Twist of Marley. Butler's contribution to the album was a jazz cover of No Woman No Cry. Butler maintained a loyal following in the 1980s and 1990s, in South Africa, the United States and Europe. In 2006, Butler was a featured vocalist on the album Gospel Goes Classical, produced by University of Alabama at Birmingham music professor Henry Panion. This recording, featuring arrangements by Panion, Tommy Stewart, Michael Loveless, and Ray Reach, rose to No. 2 on the Billboard Gospel chart, and No. 3 on the Classical Crossover chart. He was also nominated for a Grammy Award for his single \\"Going Home\\". Also in 2008, Butler guest-starred on George Duke's Album Dukey Treats, alongside the late Teena Marie on the track Sudan, talking about the disasters of Darfur.

The Rostyle wheel was especially popular during the 1960s and 1970s. The wheels had a characteristic pressed steel form with raised 'spokes', and were painted aluminium-grey on the spokes and rim and black between the spokes to imitate the open space of true magnesium alloy wheels. They were designed for use without the need of hubcaps or wheel covers but usually had a centre cap carrying the emblem of the car manufacturer. In the United States, the wheel style was manufactured in Lansing, Michigan, by the Motor Wheel CorporationMustang Classics, Publications International Ltd and found fame in the 1960s and 1970s on Muscle cars like the Pontiac GTO, Ford Torino, Shelby Mustang, Plymouth Barracuda and AMC Javelin. In an American context the wheel style was known as the \\"Magnum 500\\". Hence, the first British cars with \\"Rostyle\\" wheels were referred to in early road tests as having \\"Magnum style\\" wheels. The first appearance of Rostyle wheels on the Rover P5B met with descriptions of them by some testers as \\"raffish\\" and \\"gaudy\\" Rover 3 & 3.5 litre 1958 - 1973, a selection of contemporary road tests, Brooklands Books and ill-befitting a luxury saloon. At that time, some Rover road testers also referred to the wheels as \\"Ro-style\\", suggesting that the name, if not the style, may have first been developed specifically for wheels fitted to Rovers. Although this surfaces as \\"fact\\" on forums it is not correct. The name \\"Rostyle\\" is a portmanteau word deriving from \\"R-ubery O-wen\\" (the manufacturer of the wheels) and \\"Style\\": \\"ROstyle\\": \\"Rostyle\\". The firms MG and Rover, amongst other British sporty cars in the 1960s often specified Rostyle wheels as original equipment instead of ones made of light alloy or wire spoked wheels. Chromium-plated Rostyle wheels were made for Jensen, Rover and, famously, the Ford Cortina 1600E, originally designed for Ford Chairman Len Crossland's wife. Rostyle wheels were the only wheel option on the Range Rover for many years following its introduction. These 16-inch Rostyles were used on the Range Rover until 1986 when they were replaced by alloy wheels. The Rostyles then became optional fitment to the short wheelbase Land Rover (the wheels were not strong enough for use on the long wheelbase models). The Land Rover maintained its optional Rostyle wheels until 1995, becoming the last vehicle to offer them from new. As well as in Britain, similar wheels were made under license in Germany, Argentina and Australia. (Rubery, Owen and Kelmsley at first, and later RO Holdings (ROH), Woodville, South Australia, and are still manufacturing world class wheels at this facility (2020) Special masks must be made to paint the wheels of restored cars to resemble the originals.

Brooks-Baker promoted it during several election cycles, ending with the 2004 presidential election, the last before his death.  History  Every four years for a number of election cycles, Harold Brooks-Baker publicized his theory during the presidential election campaign, touring the talk circuit and expounding upon it. He gave examples of Presidents whose losing opponents did not have royal blood (Ronald Reagan vs. Walter Mondale), or where the winner simply had \\"more royalty\\" (John F. Kennedy vs. Richard Nixon).The New York Times: Chronicle. October 28, 1996. Based on his theory, Brooks-Baker predicted that John Kerry would defeat the incumbent President George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election because while sharing a number of royal bloodlines Kerry had more royal ancestors than Bush.The Guardian: Kerry's royal roots will give him victory, says Burke's. August 17, 2004. However, Bush was re-elected and Brooks-Baker died a few months later.USA Today: Royal authority Harold Brooks-Baker dies. March 6, 2005. The conclusions of Brooks- Baker would be picked up by conspiracy theorist David Icke and incorporated into his formulation of a world history controlled by Illuminati, whom he saw as a race of Reptilian humanoids that included the royal houses of Europe.  Criticism  Brooks-Baker was not known for the reliability of his information. His obituary in The Daily Telegraph would say of him: \\"[H]is great advantage for journalists was that he was always available to make an arresting comment; his disadvantage was that he was often wrong\\". Critics of the theory point out that perhaps a third of all Americans may be descended from John, King of England (1199‚Äì1216), and that the odds of being distantly related to other royalty are even higher. This is an effect of a phenomenon known as pedigree collapse which occurs due to the doubling of the number of a person's ancestors with each generation. In theory, each person has over one thousand ancestors after ten generations and one million after twenty, far exceeding the number of persons actually living in most regions at any point in time. In fact, most people are descended from the same ancestors multiple times through different lines while anyone living at the time of King John could have tens of millions of descendants in the present day. There remains a factual question as to whether the number of each candidate's royal ancestors or percentage of \\"royal blood\\" can be accurately estimated without being able to trace every branch of the candidate's family tree for an indefinite length. However, the relevance of such descent is also questioned due to the relatively small degree of inheritance a person receives from such distant ancestors. For instance, a person ten generations removed from a royal ancestor would have less than one thousandth of that ancestor's DNA and this amount would be halved with each subsequent generation. Thus, even if being a twenty-seventh generation descendant of King John could confer some advantage on a presidential contender, it is unclear how it would have any measurable effect.The New York Times: Royal Genes Too Diluted to Help Bush. July 21, 1988. The central claim that until 2004 the winner was always the most royal is called into question by four instances in which successive elections were contested by the same two candidates, with different results. In 1800, 1828, 1840 and 1892, the victorious candidate had lost to the same opponent in the previous election.

The marina is to the left. Deep Cove refers to the community in the easternmost part of the District of North Vancouver, in British Columbia, Canada, and is also the geographic name of the small bay beside the town. It is affectionately referred to as \\"The Cove\\" by local residents. Located at the foot of Mount Seymour, Deep Cove faces due east, fronting onto Indian Arm, a branch of the Burrard Inlet. The area is the traditional territory of the Tsleil-Waututh and Squamish Nations. Deep Cove is from downtown Vancouver. History Deep Cove, or Deepwater as it was first known, is a traditional clamming and fishing area of the Tsleil-Waututh nation who lived in the area since time immemorial. British and Spanish naval explorers scouted Indian Arm in the late eighteenth century, and by the mid- nineteenth century, whales were being caught and flensed on the Cove's shores. Deep Cove became a popular summer resort for Vancouver residents in the 1910s, with cabins, logging and granite quarrying featuring in the local history. For many years, the focal point of the community included a yacht club, dance hall and general store. The population slowly grew in the 1960s and 1970s, when access to the area improved following the completion of the Second Narrows Bridge to Vancouver in 1960. However, Deep Cove held on to its rural feel, and a large, open horse paddock sat adjacent to Gallant Avenue in this period. Today, the Cove remains a popular attraction in the district, drawing visitors from neighbouring Cove Cliff, Dollarton, Parkgate, Indian Arm and Woodlands areas. Recreation Deep Cove offers kayaking activities from the marina, among other sports. With its proximity to forests, mountains, skiing, hiking, parks and the water, Deep Cove is well known among outdoor recreation enthusiasts. The Deep Cove Bike Shop, a local institution, brought the first mountain bikes to Vancouver in the early 1980s. Deep Cove is a popular small boat centre, with a Rowing Club, kayak rentals and lessons, and a marina. The bay in front of the community is one of the few in Indian Arm which has both a sheltering shape and the shallow bottom required for overnight anchorage of pleasure vessels. The Baden-Powell Trail leading up to the lookout point, Quarry Rock, is a popular spot for visitors, especially in the summer. The Cultural Centre houses the First Impressions Theatre Company in the 130-seat air-conditioned Shaw Theatre, the Seymour Art Gallery, and the Deep Cove Heritage Society. Education Deep Cove is served by three community schools, Cove Cliff Elementary, Seycove Secondary and Sherwood Park Elementary School, as well as two other schools in the surrounding area. Students participating in the French immersion program attend Argyle Secondary School, Windsor Secondary School, Sherwood Park Elementary School, or Dorothy Lynas Elementary School. A number of childhood learning and care facilities serve the residents as well. As the teaching philosophies and practices differ, the common banner term of \\"Preschool\\" or \\"Pre-K\\" are appropriate.

Built from 1978 through 1984, and officially shut down on September 30, 2014,Last Light at NSLS the NSLS was considered a second-generation synchrotron. The NSLS experimental floor consists of two electron storage rings: an X-ray ring and a VUV (vacuum ultraviolet) ring which provide intense, focused light spanning the electromagnetic spectrum from the infrared through X-rays. The properties of this light and the specially designed experimental stations, called beamlines, allow scientists in many fields of research to perform experiments not otherwise possible at their own laboratories. History Ground was broken for the NSLS on September 28, 1978. The VUV ring began operations in late 1982 and the X-ray ring was commissioned in 1984. In 1986, a second phase of construction expanded the NSLS by , which added offices, laboratories and room for new experimental equipment. After 32 years of producing synchrotron light, the final stored beam was dumped at 16.00 EDT on 30 September 2014, and NSLS was officially shut down. During the construction of the NSLS, two scientists, Renate Chasman and George Kenneth Green, invented a special periodic arrangement of magnetic elements (a magnetic lattice) to provide optimized bending and focusing of electrons. The design was called the Chasman‚ÄìGreen lattice, and it became the basis of design for every synchrotron storage ring. Storage rings are characterized by the number of straight sections and bend sections in their design. The bend sections produce more light than the straight sections due to the change in angular momentum of the electrons. Chasman and Green accounted for this in their design by adding insertion devices, known as wigglers and undulators, in the straight sections of the storage ring. These insertion devices produce the brightest light among the sections of the ring and thus, beamlines are typically built downstream from them. VUV ring A beamline for synchrotron light at Brookhaven. The VUV ring at the National Synchrotron Light Source was one of the first of the 2nd generation light sources to operate in the world. It was initially designed in 1976 and commissioned in 1983. During the Phase II upgrade in 1986, two insertion wigglers/undulators were added to the VUV ring, providing the highest brightness source in the vacuum ultraviolet region until the advent of 3rd generation light sources. X-ray ring The X-ray ring at the National Synchrotron Light Source was one of the first storage rings designed as a dedicated source of synchrotron radiation. The final lattice design was completed in 1978 and the first stored beam was obtained in September 1982. By 1985, the experimental program was in a rapid state of development, and by the end of 1990, the Phase II beamlines and insertion devices were brought into operation. Design Electrons generate the synchrotron radiation that is used at the end stations of beamlines. The electrons are first produced by a 100 KeV triode electron gun. These electrons then proceed through a linear accelerator (linac), which gets them up to 120 MeV. Next, the electrons enter a booster ring, where their energy is increased to 750 MeV, and are then injected into either the VUV ring or the X-ray ring. In the VUV ring, the electrons are further ramped up to 825 MeV and electrons in the X-ray ring are ramped to 2.8 GeV. Once in the ring, VUV or X-ray, the electrons orbit and lose energy as a result of changes in their angular momentum, which cause the expulsion of photons. These photons are deemed white light, i.e. polychromatic, and are the source of synchrotron radiation. Before being used in a beamline endstation, the light is collimated before reaching a monochromator or series of monochromators to get a single and fixed wavelength. During normal operations, the electrons in the storage rings lose energy and as such, the rings must be re-injected every 12 (X-ray ring) and 4 (VUV ring) hours. The difference in time arises from the fact that VUV light has a larger wavelength and thus has lower energy which leads to faster decay, while the X-rays have a very small wavelength and are high energy. This was the first synchrotron to be controlled using microprocessors. Facilities The UV ring has 19 beamlines, of which 13 are operational. The X-ray ring has 58 beamlines, of which 51 are operational. The beamlines are operated and funded in numerous ways. However, since the NSLS is a user facility, any scientist that submits a proposal may be granted beamtime after peer-review. There are two types of beamlines at the NSLS: Facility Beamlines (FBs), of which there are 18, and Participating Research Team (PRT) beamlines, which currently total 46. FBs are operated by the NSLS staff and reserve a minimum of 50 percent of their beamtime for users and PRT beamlines reserve 25 percent of their beamtime for users. Each X-ray beamline has an endstation called a hutch. These are large enclosures made of radiation shielding materials, such as steel and leaded glass, to protect the users from the ionizing radiation of the beam. On the X-ray floor, many of the experiments conducted use techniques such as X-ray diffraction, high-resolution powder diffraction (PXRD), XAFS, DAFS (X-ray diffraction anomalous fine structure), WAXS, and SAXS. On the VUV ring, the endstations are usually UHV (ultra-high vacuum) chambers that are used to conduct experiments using XPS, UPS, LEEM, and NEXAFS. In some beamlines, there are other analytical tools used in conjunction with synchrotron radiation, such as a mass spectrometer, a high-power laser, or a gas chromatography mass spectrometer. These techniques help supplement and better quantify the experiments carried out at the endstation. Achievements and statisticsNobel prizes= In 2003, Roderick MacKinnon won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for deciphering the structure of the neuronal ion channel. His work was in part conducted at the NSLS. In 2009, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas A. Steitz , and Ada E. Yonath won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for imaging the ribosome with atomic resolution through their use of x-ray crystallography at the NSLS and other synchrotron light sources. =User statistics= The National Synchrotron Light Source hosts more than 2,200 users from 41 U.S. states and 30 other countries every year. In 2009, there were 658 journal publications and 764 total publications including journal publications, books, patents, thesis, and reports. NSLS-II Between 2013 and 2015, the NSLS will be phased out of operation after more than 30 years of service. It will be replaced by the NSLS-II, which is designed to be 10,000 times brighter.

This was Jiang Wen's first foray into directing after years as a leading man. The film is based loosely on author Wang Shuo's novel Wild Beast. Synopsis The film is set in Beijing during the Cultural Revolution. It is told from the perspective of Ma Xiaojun, nicknamed Monkey (played by Xia Yu; some of Monkey's experiences mimic director Jiang's during the Revolution),\\"Interview with Jiang Wen.\\" CNN. July 23, 2007. Retrieved on September 19, 2012. who is a teenage boy at the time. Monkey and his friends are free to roam the streets of Beijing day and night because the Cultural Revolution has caused their parents and most adults to be either busy or away and the school system is extremely nonfunctional. Most of the story happens during one summer, so the main characters are even more free because there is no school. The events of that summer revolve around Monkey's dalliances with his roguish male friends, and his subsequent angst-filled crush on one of the older female characters, Mi Lan (Ning Jing). Mi Lan falls instead for Monkey's friend, Liu Yiku. The film reflects Monkey, reminiscing as an older man, and his struggle with remembering his youth. Framed by his adult life in 1990s Beijing, portrayed in black and white, and presented in snippets of memory in color, the viewer is asked to question the accuracy of Monkey's memory and wrestle with the truth of the time. Production The film was a co- production between three Chinese studios, and US$2 million (about $ when adjusted for inflation) of the budget was generated from Hong Kong. Derek Elley of Variety said that the film alters \\"some 70% of the original\\" novel and adds \\"a mass of personal memories.\\"\\"In the Heat of the Sun.\\" Variety. Sunday October 16, 1994.

In contrast to the Cultural Revolution-set films of Chinese 5th-generation filmmakers (Zhang Yimou, Chen Kaige, Tian Zhuangzhuang) which put the era into a larger historical setting, In The Heat Of the Sun is mellow and dream-like, portraying memories of that era with somewhat positive and personal resonances. It also acknowledges, as the narrator recalls, that he might have misremembered parts of his adolescence as stated in the prologue: \\"Change has wiped out my memories. I can't tell what's imagined from what's real\\", as the director offers alternative or imagined versions to some events as people seek to romanticize their youthful memories.The film was commercially successful in China. Critic Raymond Zhou talked about the ambiguity in Jiang Wen's movies: \\"Ambiguity is a major characteristic. Since two of his four features wax nostalgic about the 'Cultural Revolution' (1966-76), a period that evokes painful memories for many Chinese‚Ä¶\\" As a member of the liumang generation, too young to be sent to the countryside in the Culture Revolution yet old enough to have knowledge of life under Mao, Jiang has experienced the Maoist past, but has not been visibly scarred by it. Vukovich wrote that the film however did cause some controversy in China for its perceived \\"nostalgic\\" and \\"positive\\" portrayal of the Cultural Revolution.Vukovich, page unstated (Google Books PT148). According to Vukovich, the film \\"received much less attention than any fifth- generation classics\\" despite the \\"critical appreciation in festivals abroad\\". Vukovich stated that in Western countries \\"the film has been subjected to an all too familiar coding as yet another secretly subversive, dissenting critique of Maoist and Cultural Revolution totalitarianism\\", with the exceptions being the analyses of Chen Xiaoming from Mainland China and Wendy Larson. Reviews and critics Immediately after the film's release, major critics praised it as the most important work in Chinese cinema since Zhang Yimou's Hong gaoliang/ Red Sorghum (1987). In the Heat of the Sun resonates with Zhang's film not only in reinventing cinematic language but also in retelling a key moment in China's history. Awards and recognition Well received in China and the Chinese-speaking world but very obscure in the United States, the film won the 51st Venice Film Festival's Best Actor Award for its young lead actor Xia Yu (Xia was then the youngest recipient of the Best Actor award at Venice) as well as the Golden Horse Film Awards in Taiwan for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor. American director Quentin Tarantino also gave high praises to the film, calling it \\"really great.\\"Quentin Tarantino Interview - KILL BILL And Others by New Cinema Magazine. It was the first People's Republic of China film to win Best Picture in the Golden Horse Film Awards, in the very year where Chinese-language films from the mainland were first allowed to participate. The film was a domestic box office hit in 1995, beating the Hollywood blockbusters like The True Lies, Lion King and Forrest Gump.  References  * Bao, Ying.

The first location opened in 1996 at 401 Bleecker Street, on the corner of West 11th Street in the West Village neighborhood of Manhattan. The bakery is known for its desserts, especially its cupcakes.  History  The original Magnolia Bakery was opened in 1996 by Jennifer Appel and Allysa Torey. The bakery began making cupcakes with leftover cake batter, and the cupcakes subsequently became very popular with customers. In 1999, co-owner Jennifer Appel left the business after a disagreement about expansion plans. Appel opened Buttercup Bake Shop at 973 Second Avenue in the Midtown East section of Manhattan. In 2006, Allysa Torey sold Magnolia Bakery to Steve Abrams, who is now the CEO of the company.  Cupcakes  The bakery is sometimes credited with helping to start a 1990s \\"cupcake craze\\". Co-owners Jennifer Appel and Allysa Torey published a book in 1999 entitled The Magnolia Bakery Cookbook: Old-Fashioned Recipes from New York's Sweetest Bakery. The exterior of the original bakery, as well as its cupcakes, were featured in \\"Lazy Sunday\\", a Saturday Night Live Digital Short broadcast in December 2005. The bakery was also featured on Sex and the City; in the film Prime, in which one of the characters throws Magnolia pies at his ex-girlfriends; and in The Devil Wears Prada, in which the character Andy says at one point that she needs to get to the bakery to pick something up for her boyfriend. The sitcom Spin City also has Charlie Sheen's character bringing Magnolia Cupcakes to Heather Locklear's character. On October 16, 2008, Conan O'Brien bought a cupcake for each member of his audience during a taping of Late Night. It was also briefly mentioned in the third season of Veronica Mars, the title character affectionately mentioning a picture of her father \\"stuffing cupcakes in [his] face at Magnolia Bakery.\\"  Locations  Magnolia's Cupcakes in South Korea Magnolia Bakery has expanded from its original location with additional stores in the U.S. and internationally. In 2011, Magnolia Bakery CEO Steve Abrams stated that he had plans to open approximately three stores a year, adding that he would work with franchisees to expand overseas. The company's U.S. locations include stores in New York City, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington, DC. A franchise in Honolulu that featured Magnolia's first sit-down, full-service restaurant in the U.S. closed on October 27, 2018. Magnolia Bakery's first non-U.S. store opened in Dubai in 2010, with two additional franchises opening in Dubai and one in Abu Dhabi. Other international franchises are currently operating in Saudi Arabia, which has eight locations as of October 2020; Qatar, which has four locations; Amman, Jordan; Daegu, South Korea; Taguig City, Philippines (where it is known as M Bakery); and Mexico City, Mexico. A store also opened in Moscow, but then closed on July 1, 2016. . In November 2019, the company opened its first outlet in India. In May 2018, CEO Steve Abrams announced the launch of up to 200 new Magnolia stores across the United States. The company also plans to open branches in Manila and Sao Paulo.. Magnolia launched its first outlet in India in November 2019 in the city of Bangalore.

Biography Soglo served in the French army in Indochina. He had a French wife. After Benin achieved independence in 1960, Soglo was given the rank of colonel in the army and became the chief of staff under President Hubert Maga. On October 28, 1963, Soglo took control of the country to prevent a civil war.. Soglo had previously declared loyalty to Maga's government. He established a provisional government with himself as chairman after dissolving the national assembly. After reorganizing the government, he gave up power in January 1964 and allowed former premier Sourou-Migan Apithy to become president. Soon Apithy and other political leaders began massive feuds over policies. After repeatedly encouraging the various political forces to agree to dialogue, Soglo again overthrew the government in November 1965 and served as President of Benin under a military government until December 1967, when a group of younger army officers overthrew him.

He is best known as the co-founder, keyboardist and lead vocalist of the band Savatage, which he co-founded with his younger brother Criss Oliva. Since 1996 he has also been a songwriter, musician and vocalist in Trans-Siberian Orchestra. Producer Paul O'Neill, who had worked with many of the rock world's biggest acts, referred to Oliva in numerous interviews as the single greatest vocalist/musician he has ever worked with.Orangeleader, Texas, April 28, 2011 Biography=Early life Jon and Criss's family moved around a lot during their childhood, living in California for four years until moving to Florida with his family in 1976. Much like his brother Criss, Jon found music his calling during the family's time in California. Starting off with his father's piano, Jon dabbled in guitars, pianos and drums before buying \\"a really ugly bass\\". Jon and Criss continued their musical exploits and played a block party, playing Kiss, Deep Purple and ZZ Top covers. Although originally the guitar player of the brothers, Jon quickly realized Criss's talent was superior to his and stuck to singing and swapped with his brother and played bass. Having been kicked out of high school in 1978, Jon needed a job, and was lucky enough to join a band called Metropolis, a band playing Bad Company and Alice Cooper cover songs. This gave Jon his first touring experience as the band played bars and clubs in various parts of Florida, but Jon quickly grew tired of the bars and clubs, leaving the band later that year. Jon and Criss re-united to form Avatar, out of their two most recent bands, Alien and Tower respectively. Avatar would later become Savatage. Earning the envy of most other Floridan bands due to their \\"awesome equipment\\", Avatar was originally a five-piece, with Jon on drums and vocals, and Criss on guitar. The band slowly drifted apart until Jon and Criss remained, and the two got jobs at \\"The Pit\\", a practice shack where they met Steve Wacholz. Wacholz was very familiar with the Oliva brothers, who he first met in 1977. He saw Criss play at a local high school and was blown away. Very soon after, he auditioned for Jon's band, Alien. When he got to the audition, Wacholz recognized Criss and Jon as part of the band who had impressed him so much at the high school show. Steve would eventually join a new version of Avatar, joined later by bass player Keith Collins, who originally knew the band as they hired his equipment. Jon felt restrained by playing instruments and subsequently stuck to being the band's lead vocalist. Avatar initially received exposure via a free Tampa Bay music publication called Music Magazine, who recommended the band to Tampa radio station WYNF, who were holding a contest for a spot on an LP. Avatar opened both sides of the LP with tracks \\"Rock Me\\" and \\"Minus Love\\". WYNF also gave the fledgling band concerts. In late 2006, footage was released onto the internet of an early performance by Avatar at a gig in a Clearwater, Florida parking lot and was prominent in featuring an early version of the song \\"Holocaust\\", which would later be released on Savatage's first album and a cover of Van Halen's \\"Eruption\\" and VH's version of \\"You Really Got Me\\". Avatar's rising local stardom enabled them to record an LP with Par Records. An initial EP, entitled City Beneath the Surface sold 1000 copies, and Par Records invited Avatar back to the studio to record a full album. However, there was an issue with a European band called Avatar who disagreed to the usage of the name, and the band needed to find a solution and fast, as the album was due to be pressed the following day. Jon and Criss were playing cards with their wives when they got a phone call and after initial tweaking, they finally arrived at Savatage. That full album was Sirens, the first Savatage record. Savatage The new name did not change the band's attitude or rave reviews. Quickly, Atlantic Records were becoming interested in the band, and label reps flew in from New York to see the band perform. Atlantic quickly got Savatage signed to a deal, but Savatage finished out their deal with Par, releasing EP The Dungeons Are Calling in 1984. The band's first release for Atlantic was unleashed in 1985, entitled Power of the Night, the album was produced by Max Norman, who had produced the legendary Ozzy Osbourne albums Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman as well as producing Megadeth's hit 1992 album, Countdown to Extinction among others. During this time, the band hired Johnny Lee Middleton to replace Keith Collins on bass duties due to musical differences. Savatage were finally getting exposure, but in 1986, the band released Fight for the Rock, a stab at mainstream success that was driven primarily by Atlantic. Jon himself refers to the record as Fight for the Nightmare. The material was written mostly by Jon and Criss in the kitchen of the apartment the band was staying in. Some of the songs were written in the studio, such as \\"Lady In Disguise.\\" Atlantic put a lot of pressure on the band to become a radio friendly band and this resulted in the two covers of Free's \\"Wishing Well\\" and Badfinger's \\"Day After Day\\". Fans were confused by the sudden shift in sound the band took and sales did not meet expectations. Jon had however described the album as a good \\"musical and life experience\\". Jon then met Paul O'Neill, who saw that Savatage had the potential to be a big act. 1987's Hall of the Mountain King was released to critical acclaim and is cited by many fans as being one of the band's best works. Two music videos were released and received rotation on MTV, for \\"24 Hours Ago\\" and the title track. On the resulting tour, Savatage supported Megadeth and Dio, but Jon had many conflicts with Dave Mustaine, who at the time was a serious substance abuser. After hanging out with Mustaine on a 24-hour basis, after the tour, Jon entered rehab. Jon altered the band's direction into a more progressive sound, and the resulting record was Gutter Ballet, released in 1989. Many of the songs on the album Jon came up with while in rehab, including \\"Thorazine Shuffle\\" and \\"Mentally Yours\\". The song \\"Gutter Ballet\\" was one of the last to be recorded, and was in fact recorded with just Jon and Criss in the studio. After seeing a performance of the Phantom of the Opera in Toronto, Jon was so inspired he wrote \\"Gutter Ballet\\" in the studio. Two videos were filmed for the album and again received MTV airplay: \\"When the Crowds are Gone\\" and the title track. In 1991, the band created their first rock opera, Streets. The record did not do as well as the band would have liked, however, as it was released around the time that grunge exploded onto the mainstream music arena. But a video for \\"Jesus Saves\\" was recorded and again got airplay and got a new audience to appreciate the band. Jon has stated that his favorite song of all-time was recorded on Streets: Tonight He Grins Again. However, after a tour in support of the album, Jon Oliva left the band. The official reason given was to concentrate on his side- projects Doctor Butcher and his Broadway-bound musical Romanov as well as continuing co-writing Savatage material with his brother Criss and producer Paul O'Neill. Jon's last show was at the first ever Tampa Music Awards in 1992 and in 2006, footage was released onto the internet of this last performance. However, as of 2007, Romanov is in the hands of the Pace Theatrical Group and has gone through several rewrites, but has yet to see the light of day. Jon hand-picked his Savatage replacement, former Wicked Witch lead vocalist Zachary Stevens and the band recorded their follow-up to Streets, Edge of Thorns in 1993. For the first time, Savatage began to enjoy mainstream recognition, including increased radio play and a world tour. Jon since admitted that he never wanted to be Savatage's only vocalist, and said he left to \\"take care of myself\\". Originally, Jon was to leave the band, then return as a lead vocalist on the follow-up record to Edge of Thorns.ProgPowerUK II programme. Interview with Jon Oliva, page 9. Around this same time, Jon was approached by one-time Savatage guitarist, Chris Caffery, who recorded with the band on Gutter Ballet. Jon and Chris wrote some songs together and eventually, this became Doctor Butcher. Along with drummer John Osborn, the three went into the studio and made the album for about $8,000. Doctor Butcher played a couple of shows in the Tampa area in 1993, one of which included an appearance by Criss Oliva who joined the band on stage for a rendition of \\"Sirens\\". Jon however was hurt that Atlantic Records chose not to release the Butcher record, and also that Edge of Thorns was getting a spot in the US Top 100. He was happy for the band, but had mixed emotions, and began to think that he might have been the one holding Savatage back. However, tragedy struck when Criss Oliva was killed in a car accident by a drunk driver on October 17, 1993.Tony Green, \\"Associates mourn Savatage star\\", St. Petersburg Times (Florida), October 19, 1993, p. 6B Jon chose to continue the band, although he has since admitted that the band was pretty much over after Criss's death, but only kept going because of his memory and to \\"keep his music alive\\". Savatage's 1994 album Handful of Rain is considered Jon Oliva's tribute to his brother. He recorded the album along with Stevens and Alex Skolnick, formerly of Testament. Even though the other Savatage members are credited, Oliva plays the majority of the instruments. Jon made a return to the fore of Savatage on their live release Japan Live '94 which saw him take up lead vocal duties for the first time since 1992, performing a duet on \\"Gutter Ballet\\". Oliva returned to perform vocal duties for Savatage's 1995 album Dead Winter Dead, supplying vocals to the tracks \\"I Am\\" and \\"Doesn't Matter Anyway\\". However, Jon was not prepared for the success the band would finally achieve, albeit indirectly. The track \\"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\\" became a huge hit around Christmas time that year on many radio formats. The song was re- released in 1996 by the new side project of the band, the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. Oliva has stated however that he was saddened about the success of the record, citing the fact that the same song was released by both bands, yet TSO's rendition became a bigger hit. This led Jon to believe that the biggest barrier to success was the Savatage name. He was featured on the album WWF Full Metal in 1996, singing the song \\"We're All Together Now\\" with several WWE professional wrestlers as part of the Slam Jam. An instrumental loop of the track was used as bumper music for the federation's RAW is WAR program until 2002. While featured in other musical projects, he remained involved in every song Savatage recorded, including 1998's The Wake of Magellan, where he was featured as lead vocalist on tracks \\"Another Way\\" and \\"Paragons of Innocence\\". Shortly after wrapping the recording of The Wake of Magellan, he produced and sang back up vocals for Tampa/Clearwater band Dave's Not Here as a favor to former 98Rock jockey and Dave's Not Here lead vocalist, Todd T. Riley. In 2000, Oliva contributed the song \\"Perfect Christmas Night\\" to the Jim Carrey vehicle The Grinch. In 2001, after Stevens left the band citing family reasons, Oliva returned to provide lead vocals for Savatage's new album, Poets and Madmen. It was his first appearance as a lead vocalist on a Savatage studio record in 10 years. Jon Oliva's Pain Oliva on stage in 2007 After touring and writing with TSO, Oliva formed his own band Jon Oliva's Pain (often known as JOP) in 2003. JOP released an album entitled 'Tage Mahal in 2004 on the SPV label, then subsequently signed to AFM Records in March 2006 for the release of their second album Maniacal Renderings which was released on September 4, 2006. JOP's third recording was released on May 6, 2008 and was titled Global Warning. In the last two recordings, JOP has re-worked and re-recorded songs from a collection of old recordings with his brother Criss Oliva. Health issues In April 2016, Oliva suffered a mild stroke from which he fully recovered.

Built from 1858 to 1864, no battles were fought there and no troops were stationed there. Advancing military technology, including iron clad ships and long range guns, made the fort obsolete before it could be used. The fort is now a park, accessible only by boat. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. . History Fort Gorges as seen from Portland harbor. Following the War of 1812, the United States Army Corps of Engineers proposed that a fort be built on Hog Island Ledge, in Casco Bay at the entrance to the harbor at Portland, Maine. It was part of the third system of US fortifications. Named for the colonial proprietor of Maine, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, it was constructed to support existing forts, including Fort Preble in South Portland and Fort Scammel built on nearby House Island in 1808. Congress, however, did not fund construction of Fort Gorges until 1857. The walls of the fort were begun the next year, and when the American Civil War broke out in 1861, work quickly advanced. The fort was designed by Colonel Reuben Staples Smart. The chief architect in charge of construction was Thomas Lincoln Casey, who later became Chief of Engineers. It is similar in size and construction to Fort Sumter, but is built of granite instead of brick. The fort was completed in 1865 as the war ended. Modern explosives made the fort obsolete by the time it was completed. A modernization plan was begun in 1869, but funding was cut off in 1876, with the third level of the fort still unfinished. During the modernization project, sod-covered sand was added to the top level of the fort to protect gun encasements and powder magazines from attacks. The Fort's armament consisted of thirty-four 10-inch Rodman guns mounted in the fort's casemates. In 1898, all guns were removed from the fort except a large 300-pounder () Parrott rifle which was on the top of the fort but not mounted. The 300-pounder Parrott rifle still remains in place and is one of the largest surviving specimens of Civil War vintage artillery. The fort was last used by the Army during World War II, when it was used to store submarine mines. It was acquired by the city of Portland in 1960 and placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. It is now open to the public as a park, and is accessible only by private boat or hired water taxi. Visitors are recommended to carry a flashlight to enter the powder magazines. The fort is in need of restoration. Friends of Fort Gorges initiated a $250,000 fundraising campaign for money to make critical repairs to the facility in the Summer of 2019. Portland developer Mike Dugay has proposed converting the location into a commercial space to include a bed and breakfast, restaurant, and brewery.We kayaked to an abandoned fort in Portland, Maine, that's only accessible by private boat, and it's now completely overrun by nature Retrieved October 12, 2019 See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Portland, Maine * Seacoast defense in the United States * List of coastal fortifications of the United States References * This article contains public domain text from * This article contains public domain text from External links * *Friends of Fort Gorges Website *Article and photos of the fort - Fort Tours *Article and photos of the fort * Gorges Category:Buildings and structures in Portland, Maine Category:Casco Bay Category:Islands of Portland, Maine Category:Parks in Portland, Maine Category:1858 establishments in Maine Category:Forts on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in Portland, Maine ","title":"Fort Gorges"},{"id":"3554503","text":"American High School (AHS) is a public secondary school located in Fremont, California, United States.

Born a United States citizen, the son of (Charles) Silas Baker (1888‚Äì1943),Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 2013, pg 44 a Washington, D.C. attorney, and his wife, Elizabeth Lambert, he attended Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut and Harvard University, in the same class as Ted Kennedy. He married (and divorced) a French aristocrat, Irene Le Gras du Luart de Montsaulnin, and they had two daughters; Nadia Elizabeth (b. 1965), who married Gregory, Jonkheer van Loudon, and Natasha Yolande D. (b. 1968). In 1997 he remarried to Catherine Neville-Rolfe. Brooks-Baker preferred to be known as \\"Brookie\\" (to the extent that the record of his death in 2005 was made under both his real name and 'Brookie Brooks-Baker'). He adopted the \\"Brooks-\\" part of his surname voluntarily, perhaps because of a dispute with French authorities about his children's middle names. He became a bond trader and settled in London in the 1960s. In 1974 Brooks-Baker and his business partners took over Debrett's, publisher of several titles on British aristocracy including Debrett‚Äôs Peerage & Baronetage. In 1984 he moved to Burke's Peerage Partnership as director of publishing. The partnership had been in poor financial health for years and had already sold its flagship publication, Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage. Brooks-Baker was never associated with Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, but oversaw the publication of books about genealogy and the aristocracy including Burke's Presidential Families of the United States of America. The company's major business was genealogical research. As public relations for Burke's, he was a frequent commentator on the British Royal family and aristocracy in the British press. He was famous for his ostentatious and oft-disputed pronouncements regarding British royalty, and for his advocacy of the most royal candidate theory of U.S. presidential succession. In 1986, he also controversially endorsed in a letter written to the British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, a claimed British royal ancestral connection with the Muslim prophet Muhammad. The Daily Telegraph would say in his obituary, \\"[H]is great advantage for journalists was that he was always available to make an arresting comment; his disadvantage was that he was often wrong.\\" He was once investigated by the FBI for an alleged scam in which he took money from people by claiming he would help them verify whether they were related to a billionaire who had died without known heirs. He was often credited as 'H. B. Brooks-Baker'.

It provides for fluorescence, diffraction, and transmission imaging with hard X-rays at a spatial resolution of 30 nm or better. A dedicated source, beamline, and optics form the basis for these capabilities. This unique instrument is not only key to the specific research areas of the CNM; it will also be a general utility, available to the broader nanoscience community in studying nanomaterials and nanostructures, particularly for embedded structures. The combination of diffraction, fluorescence, and transmission contrast in a single tool provides unique characterization capabilities for nanoscience. Current hard X-ray microprobes based on Fresnel zone plate optics have demonstrated a spatial resolution of 150 nm at a photon energy of 8-10 keV. With advances in the fabrication of zone plate optics, coupled with an optimized beamline design, the performance goal is a spatial resolution of 30 nm. The nanoprobe covers the spectral range of 3-30 keV, and the working distance between the focusing optics and the sample are typically in the range of 10‚Äì20 mm. Image:Nanoprobe.jpg Modes of operation Transmission. In this mode, either attenuation or phase shift of the X-ray beam by the sample can be measured. Absorption contrast can be used to map the sample‚Äôs density. Particular elemental constituents can be located using measurements on each side of an absorption edge to give an element-specific difference image with moderate sensitivity. Phase-contrast imaging can be sensitive to internal structure even when absorption is low and can be enhanced by tuning the X-ray energy. Diffraction. By measuring X-rays diffracted from the sample, one can obtain local structural information, such as crystallographic phase, strain, and texture, with an accuracy 100 times higher than with standard electron diffraction. Fluorescence. Induced X-ray fluorescence reveals the spatial distribution of individual elements in a sample. Because an X-ray probe offers 1,000 times higher sensitivity than electron probes, the fluorescence technique is a powerful tool for quantitative trace element analysis, important for understanding material properties such as second-phase particles, defects, and interfacial segregation. Spectroscopy. In spectroscopy mode, the primary X-ray beam‚Äôs energy is scanned across the absorption edge of an element, providing information on its chemical state (XANES) or its local environment (EXAFS), which allows the study of disordered samples. Polarization. Both linearly and circularly polarized X-rays will be available. Contrast due to polarization is invaluable in distinguishing fluorescence and diffraction signals and imaging magnetic domain structure by using techniques such as linear and circular dichroism and magnetic diffraction. Tomography. In X-ray tomography, one of these modes is combined with sample rotation to produce a series of two-dimensional projection images, to be used for reconstructing the sample‚Äôs internal three-dimensional structure. This will be particularly important for observing the morphology of complex nanostructures. In summary, a hard X-ray nanoprobe provides advantages such as being noninvasive and quantitative, requiring minimal sample preparation, giving sub-optical spatial resolution, having the ability to penetrate inside a sample and study its internal structure, and having enhanced ability to study processes in situ. Another important distinction from charged-particle probes is that X-rays do not interact with applied electric or magnetic fields, which is an advantage for in-field studies. The design of the nanoprobe beamline aims to preserve these potential advantages.

It is close to Biebrza National Park. The village has a population of 610. History First records of Trzcianne come from the 13th century. The name probably comes from reeds () surrounding the river that flowed through the village. According to the records of Aleksander Jagiellon, Grand Duke of Lithuania, the first Catholic church in Trzcianne was built before 1496. It survived for ca. 100 years. The current, fourth church in Trzcianne was built in 1846 and consecrated in 1860. The vast majority of Trzcianne's population in the 20th century were Jewish.The first Jews arrived in Tzcianne in the 18th century. It was a shtetl, in the 1909 census, 98% of Trzcianne‚Äôs population was Jewish. There is still an old Jewish cemetery in the village, but it is not tended by anyone. According to the 1921 census, the village was inhabited by 1.434 people, among whom 33 were Roman Catholic, 1.401 Mosaic. At the same time, 33 inhabitants declared Polish nationality, 1.401 Jewish.

Then, they gathered together more than 1000 local Jews in the neighboring village of Zubole. The Jews were kept in the gravel pit and then in a barn for almost a week before the series mass executions took place. 400 to 700 Jews were murdered. The rest of the Jews were released. In autumn of 1941, a ghetto was created in Trzcianne. It lasted until November 2, 1942, when the Jews from the ghetto were sent to the Bogusze transit camp. A few weeks later, with Jews from surrounding town and villages, they were sent to Treblinka and Auschwitz death camps. Right before the Second World War, there were about 2500 Jews living in the village, only 25 Trzcianne Jews survived the Holocaust.

He served as a United States Representative and United States Senator, and helped found the Whig Party. Early life Swift was born in Amenia, New York, the son of Job Swift and Mary Ann (Sedgwick) Swift. In 1786, at the age of five, he moved with his father to Bennington, Vermont. He attended the common schools in Bennington before attending Litchfield Law School in 1801. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1806. He began the practice of law in Bennigton before moving to Manchester to practice law. In 1809 he moved to St. Albans to practice law. He also engaged in banking and farming in the area. Political career He held various political positions in Vermont, and was elected to the Vermont State House in 1825. He served in the State House until 1827. He was then elected to serve Vermont as a National Republican Party candidate in the United States House of Representatives. He served in the Twentieth and the Twenty-first Congresses from March 4, 1827 to March 3, 1831. While in Congress, he was on the executive committee of the Congressional Temperance Society. He declined renomination. In 1833 he was elected as an Anti- Jacksonian candidate to the United States Senate, serving from March 4, 1833 to March 3, 1839. While in the Senate, Swift was a strong opponent of President Andrew Jackson and helped found the Whig Party. Swift was not renominated for a second term in the Senate and returned to St. Albans where he continued to work as a lawyer and farmer until his death. He died on November 11, 1847 in St. Albans, Vermont and is interred in Greenwood Cemetery in St. Albans. Family life Swift married Rebecca Brown on October 26, 1809.

He won the Tony Award for Scenic Design six times in his career. Biography The son of a Rabbi, Aronson was born in Kiev, in the Russian Empire (in present-day Ukraine), and enrolled in art school during his youth. Aronson became an apprentice to the designer Aleksandra Ekster, who introduced him to the directors Vsevolod Meyerhold and Alexander Tairov, who influenced him. These three theatre and art veterans were advocates of the Constructivist school in Russia, as opposed to Stanislavski's form of Realism, and they convinced Aronson to embrace the Constructivist style. Aronson worked for some years in Moscow and Germany. In Berlin he exhibited at the seminal Van Diemen Gallery \\"First Exhibition of Russian Art\\", alongside the Constructivists El Lissitzky and Naum Gabo, which introduced Constructivism to the West. He wrote two books in Berlin, on Marc Chagall and Jewish graphic art, before he obtained an Immigrant Visa for America in 1923. He moved to the Lower East Side in New York City and began designing sets and costumes for the more experimental of the city's Yiddish theatres, including the Unser Theater, the Schildkraut Theatre, and most notably Maurice Schwartz's Yiddish Art Theatre. He achieved fame in New York's Jewish community when he designed Schwartz's 1926 revival of Abraham Goldfaden's play The Tenth Commandment. Although he shunned politics, Aronson produced sets for the Communist affiliated ARTEF (Arbeiter Teater Farband, Workers' Theatre Union), such as Lag Boymer and Jim Kooperkop in 1930. However, he soon after left the Yiddish Theatre to prevent his work's \\"ghettoization\\", and debuted on Broadway, in 1932, with a revival of Vernon Duke and Yip Harburg's Walk a Little Faster. During the 1930s, he worked on productions by the Group Theatre, including works by Clifford Odets and Irwin Shaw. From 1934 to 1952, Aronson designed scenes, costumes, and lighting for thirty-four plays and three musicals on Broadway (including his design for what is considered to be the first \\"concept musical\\", Kurt Weill and Alan Jay Lerner's Love Life), but those successes were overshadowed by his work for the original 1953 production of The Crucible and the 1955 The Diary of Anne Frank (a play by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett based on Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl). He continued work on Broadway into the 1960s and 1970s with musicals including Do Re Mi, Fiddler on the Roof (for which Aronson returned to his earlier experience with Jewish theatre), Cabaret, Zorba, Company, Follies, A Little Night Music, and Pacific Overtures. He won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Set Design three times. Aronson designed sets for the Metropolitan Opera and ballet companies, including the production of The Nutcracker choreographed by Mikhail Baryshnikov. He was also a non-theatrical artist, working as a painter and sculptor. At the time of his death in 1980, he was a member of New York's theatre and art community and one of its designers. Aronson's wife was Lisa Jalowetz, who worked on many of Aronson's shows as his assistant. In 1979, a year before his death, Aronson was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame. Comments by Directors and Designers \\"For Company, Harold Prince and Aronson had discussed at length a Francis Bacon painting * of a figure in motion behind a steel-and-glass coffee table. They decided that it captured the 'frantic, anxious, driven' quality of urban life, and ... Aronson presented Prince with that famous chrome-and-glass backdrop. ... Aronson had made a study of how many buttons he pushed on an average day in New York City ... Prince ... was delighted to find that Aronson had given him two working elevators to play with.\\" \\"Michael Bennett ... was astonished that Aronson 'didn't do three projects at once', as many designers did, but instead 'watched every line change every night.' The veteran lighting designer Tharon Musser ... felt that she learned more from Aronson than from any other set designer in her long career. 'His design concepts were so strong that if someone went against them, the show would be ruined.'

The city is located in the vicinity of Islamabad, and controlled under the Capital Territory Police (CPT) to ensure the law and justice in the city. Nilore was established in 1967 as a research site for nuclear technology. It became a secret city and became one of the major research site for the integrated nuclear development to develop the atom bomb in the 1970s. It was closed to the public in the 1970s by the Ministry of Defence, and starting in 1972, the Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers acquired the entire city and immediately removed the local residents as they were paid heavy compensation. By 1973, the city communities had been removed, and fences and checkpoints had been established. Its relatively low population made acquisition affordable for the Ministry of Defence and the city was re-constructed by the Corps of Engineers. Facilities and institutes were expanded and new houses, homes, and facilities were built for the scientists and engineers who began their government research under extreme secrecy. Since then, Nilore's given nicknames include \\"Northern atomic city\\", \\"secret valley\\" and the \\"city behind the fence\\". Nilore hosted an apex scientific research in the 1960s led under Abdus Salam, and the scientific research and development still plays a crucial role in the city's economy and culture in general. Nilore is known for having one of the premier educational facilities and the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science & Technology (PINSTECH) and the Pakistan Institute of Engineering & Applied Sciences (PIEAS) are located at Nilore where they key research takes place. Since the 1990s, the city has been opened for the public and classified facilities were immediately closed by the government and re-located at unknown locations.

It is primarily used to run the clock down, either at the end of the first half or the game itself, to preserve a lead. Although it generally results in a loss of a yard and uses up a down, it minimizes the risk of a fumble, which would give the other team a chance at recovering the ball. The play is meant to keep the defense from seriously challenging for possession of the ball. The rules penalize rough play after the ball is dead, which in this play usually occurs a fraction of a second after the snap. Especially when the outcome of the game is all but certain, defenses will often give little resistance to the play as a matter of sportsmanship as well as to reduce the risk of injuries, penalties, and possible supplemental discipline. (Referees and leagues have in recent years given increasingly severe penalties for unnecessary roughness on quarterbacks and headshots in general.) The quarterback is generally not touched. The formation offers maximum protection against a fumble; should the center-quarterback exchange result in a fumble, a running back is lined up on either side of the quarterback, both to recover any fumble and protect the vulnerable kneeling player from being injured by defensive players who get through the line. Also, a player is lined up directly behind the quarterback, often much farther than a typical tailback would line up. This player's responsibility is to tackle any defensive player who may recover a fumble and attempt to advance it. Because of this essentially \\"defensive\\" responsibility, the tailback in this formation may actually be a free safety or other defensive player who is adept at making tackles in the open field. Even though the play itself takes very little time, the rules of American football dictate that it does not stop the game clock (as with any play where the ball carrier is tackled in bounds). With the 40-second play clock in the NFL and NCAA, along with the two-minute warning in the NFL, a team can run off over two minutes with three straight kneel-downs if the defensive team has no more timeouts. The winning team can storm the field if up to 40 seconds remains in the game (25 in XFL). In such situations, even before the game is technically over (i.e. the game clock will still be running), it is common for opposing coaches, team staff and players (including those not on the field for the final play) to shake hands with each other, and for media and other accredited persons to come onto the field as well to commence interviews. In the XFL, as many as three straight \\"victory formations\\" from 75 seconds left in regulation can be done. The play is often known as a \\"victory formation\\", as it is most often run by a winning team late in the game in order to preserve a victory. In the case of a close game, the winning team would be trying to avoid a turnover which might be the result of a more complex play. In the case of a more lopsided contest where the winning team's overall point differential has no prospect of affecting their playoff qualification prospects, the play can be run as a matter of sportsmanship (since the winning team forgoes the opportunity to run up the score) and to avoid further injuries and/or penalties. In terms of statistics, a kneel by the quarterback is typically recorded as a rushing attempt for ‚àí1 or ‚àí2 yards. Other sports also use the term \\"victory formation\\" for a play designed only to run down the clock with little chance of injury, such as a Jammer in roller derby skating behind or only lightly challenging the pack while the final seconds of the bout tick down. Strategy The quarterback kneel is mainly used when the team in the lead has possession of the ball with less than two minutes on the game clock. With the 40-second play clock in the NFL and NCAA, two minutes (120 seconds) is in theory the maximum amount of time that can be run off on three consecutive quarterback kneels; this assumes it is first down and the defense has no timeouts remaining. A team cannot run more than three consecutive quarterback kneels as doing so on fourth down turns the ball over to the opponent and guarantees them at least one opportunity to score. The decision to run the quarterback kneel depends on the amount of time remaining in the game, the down, and the number of timeouts the defense has remaining. For example, if there is one minute remaining on the game clock on first down, and the defense has one timeout left, the offense may use two successive quarterback kneels to completely run out the clock, and if the defense uses its timeout the offense can simply run a third kneel to run out the clock. However, if there is one minute remaining on the game clock on third down, then regardless of how many timeouts the defense has, quarterback kneels will not completely run out the clock and the offense must try to make a first down. The XFL allows this to happen if up to 75 seconds remain; there is a 25-second play clock. The quarterback kneel is also often used at the end of the first half by a team which feels they have little chance of scoring before halftime due to poor field position. It is also sometimes run at the end of the second half of a tie game by a team content with sending the game into overtime. Less commonly, the play is sometimes run at the end of the game by a losing team which is hopelessly behind and wishes to avoid injury, but is unwilling to cut the game short by forfeiting. A team that is in field-goal range and either tied on the score or trailing by 1 or 2 points can also use one or more kneeldowns in order to run time off the clock before attempting a field goal. A quarterback in this situation may also run several yards to his left or right before kneeling down in order to get a more favorable spot for the field goal attempt, in order to try and get the ball closer to the goal line and/or to get the ball to a particular set of hash marks if the team's kicker prefers to kick from a specific side of the field. Ideally, the clock would run out during the field goal attempt, thereby preventing the opposing team from getting an opportunity to score again. In several instances (including twice by the Philadelphia Eagles in the 2017 NFL season), a quarterback kneel has been purposefully initiated on a point after touchdown try at the end of the game after a game-winning or defensive touchdown was scored at the end of regulation; NFL rules used to require the try to be executed between the offense and defense, even if the offense intends to decline the unnecessary points to avoid further insulting or annoying their opponent. This occurred prominently in the 2018 \\"Minneapolis Miracle\\", where eight New Orleans Saints players on offense and defense had to return to the field from the locker room to 'oppose' the try against the victorious Minnesota Vikings after referee imploration to complete the try. Quarterback Case Keenum merely knelt the ball down before tossing it in the air and celebrating the Viking victory, with the Saints giving no effort to strip the ball (as a defensive runback for a two-point conversion would not have assured a tie or victory). The rule was changed for 2018 onward, to omit the try if it would have no impact on the outcome of the game. In rare instances, a team will use the quarterback kneel to avoid running up the score in a lopsided contest, even though there may be significant time remaining on the clock. This occurred in the 2011 edition of the Magnolia Bowl between the LSU Tigers and Ole Miss Rebels. With five minutes remaining and LSU leading 52‚Äì3, Tigers' head coach Les Miles ordered third-string quarterback Zach Mettenberger to kneel on first and goal from the Ole Miss one-yard line, and to kneel on the next three plays. Miles felt another touchdown would further embarrass Ole Miss coach Houston Nutt, who announced his resignation, effective at the end of the season, 12 days before the Rebels hosted first-ranked LSU. The Tigers had already secured the largest margin of victory in series history. In Canadian football, which use slightly different rules, kneeling with time left is not necessarily a viable strategy. Unlike in American football, in Canadian football every quarter must end with a play even in situations where the game clock expires after the end of the previous play. However, a quarterback kneel is by far the most common play for winning teams to run with \\"zeros on the clock\\" at the end of a game, barring exceptional (but not unheard-of) situations where the head-to-head point differential in the opposing teams' season series (a key factor in tiebreakers) remains in doubt. History Prior to the mid-1970s, teams leading in the final moments of games generally ran quarterback sneaks (which brought the risk of injuries on low-yardage plays) or dive plays to the fullbacks or other running backs to run time off the clock, as some coaches considered kneeling cowardly or even unsportsmanlike. However, the Miracle at the Meadowlands, on November 19, , in which defensive back Herman Edwards of the visiting Philadelphia Eagles recovered a botched handoff between quarterback Joe Pisarcik and running back Larry Csonka of the New York Giants, provided a nationally televised spur for change. With 31 seconds remaining, the Giants led 17‚Äì12 and the Eagles were out of timeouts. As Pisarcik attempted to hand it to Larry Csonka, it was awkwardly fumbled; Edwards scooped it up and ran it 26 yards for the Eagles' improbable The play generated tremendous controversy, ridicule, and criticism toward the Giants nationwide and specifically offensive coordinator Bob Gibson for failing to use the supposedly foolproof quarterback-kneeldown play. In the week following the game, both the Eagles and Giants developed specific formations designed to protect the quarterback behind three players as he fell on the ball. Previously, quarterbacks executing a similar \\"kill the clock\\" play simply ran a quarterback sneak from a tightly packed conventional offensive formation. The Eagles made the playoffs and the Giants finished at The \\"victory formation\\" spread rapidly throughout football at nearly all levels, as coaches sought to adopt a procedure for downing the ball in the final seconds which would reduce the risk of turnovers to the absolute minimum possible. Within a season or so, it had become nearly universal. In 1987 the NFL rule allowing quarterbacks to simply kneel and not have to fall down and risk a hit from the defense took effect. One of the revived XFL's most significant officiating controversies in 2020 occurred as a direct consequence of a mistimed quarterback kneel. While leading 32‚Äì23 over the Seattle Dragons, Houston Roughnecks quarterback P.J. Walker kneeled on fourth down at his own 21-yard line with three seconds remaining on the clock. Officials mistakenly declared the game over, thus depriving the Dragons the chance to run at least one offensive play in which (due to the XFL's three-point conversion rule) they should have had a chance to tie the game and force overtime. The league quickly admitted the mistake and largely avoided further scrutiny after, along with nearly all other professional sports leagues, it cancelled the remainder of its season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Defense Although in most instances a losing team will concede defeat when the other team is in the victory formation and taking the quarterback kneel, there are instances where the trailing team will try to make a defensive play in an attempt to regain possession of the ball, particularly when the losing team is behind by a touchdown or less and there is enough time to make more than one play. Formation adopted for the quarterback kneel play after the Miracle at the Meadowlands This had happened on the play preceding the Miracle at the Meadowlands. Due to the extreme difficulty and unlikelihood of causing a legal turnover when compared to the risks of injury, penalty and supplemental discipline, defenses generally do not attempt to disrupt the kneeldown as the Eagles did in 1978. By the 1980s, a \\"gentlemen's agreement\\" emerged in which defenders did not rush the offensive team with high intensity, as long as the offense made no attempt to advance the ball. One prominent exception occurred to another Giants quarterback in 2012. In Week 2, an interception of a Tampa Bay Buccaneers pass with six seconds left had apparently secured a 25-point fourth-quarter comeback and 41‚Äì34 Giant victory. However, in the ensuing \\"victory formation\\" play, instead of the usual nominal contact between the lineman, the Buccaneers stacked the line of scrimmage and forcefully pushed the Giants' line back in an attempt to cause Giants' QB Eli Manning to fumble. Manning was knocked back by his own center as he took the snap and fell down. Giants coach Tom Coughlin angrily confronted his Tampa Bay counterpart, Greg Schiano, at midfield once the game was over.Garafalo, Mike, \\"Coughlin to Schiano: 'You don't do that in this league'\\", USA Today, September 17, 2012. Accessed September 17, 2012. Undaunted, Schiano employed a similar strategy the next week at the end of the Buccaneers' game against the Dallas Cowboys. In the next season, with the Philadelphia Eagles leading the Buccaneers, Chip Kelly had quarterback Nick Foles attempt a shotgun formation kneeldown to avert Schiano's aggressive technique, which succeeded. On occasions especially in major games, the defense has made it clear they will not concede and have attempted to aggressively rush the keel down. In Super Bowl XLIX, the Seattle Seahawks, who were at their opponents' goal line as time ran out, attempted to rush the New England Patriots offensive line on two occasions, in the first instance causing an offside penalty and in the second, an on-field altercation between the two sets of players, leading to the first (and as of 2020 only) Super Bowl ejection of Seahawks player, Bruce Irvin. On the third kneeldown attempt, no rushing attempt was made. Several years later, the San Francisco 49ers also tried to rush the kneel on each down of the final possession of Super Bowl LIV, forcing Patrick Mahomes to instead run back on his first three kneel-downs and to reel back on fourth down and throw a long pass to expire the last five seconds of the game and seal the victory for the Kansas City Chiefs. These \\"kneels\\" had a combined loss of 15 yards and dropped Mahomes' game yards from 44 to 29, which affected the margins for Vegas bettors.https://uproxx.com/sports/patrick-mahomes-super-bowl-prop-bet-bad- beat-rushing-yards-kneel-video/ Aside from trying to attempt a defensive play, teams that are losing but behind by a touchdown or less in the final two minutes will sometimes use their time-outs if the team does a quarterback kneel. As teams are allowed three time-outs per half‚Äîthe clock stops on a time out and restarts on the snap‚Äîthey will try to preserve them for situations such as this, thereby forcing the winning team to run a play and gain a first down or, in the very least, take time off the clock. If there is still enough time left on the clock and the winning team attempts another quarterback kneel, the defensive team's strategy may repeat itself until it either runs out of time-outs, time runs out, or (most desirably) the team forces a punt or turnover, though in 2016, the Baltimore Ravens, leading in a game against the Cincinnati Bengals after three plays, ran off the remaining twelve seconds of clock off in a punt formation with Sam Koch purposefully holding the ball in the end zone while multiple holding calls were made against the Ravens offense. The play ended with Koch touching his toe to the back end zone line after time expired and taking an intentional safety (offensive fouls at the end of the game do not result in a replay of a down, unlike their defensive equivalents). The intentional holding aspect of the play was made illegal after the 2016 NFL season. Rules The 2011 NFL Rules state in Rule 7, Section 2, Article 1(c): \\"An official shall declare the ball dead and the down ended ‚Ä¶ when a quarterback immediately drops to his knee (or simulates dropping to his knee) behind the line of scrimmage\\". The 2011 and 2012 NCAA Rules state in Rule 4, Section 1, Article 3(o): \\"A live ball becomes dead and an official shall sound his whistle or declare it dead ‚Ä¶ When a ball carrier simulates placing his knee on the ground.\\" The same rule is used by the British American Football Association. The 2011 CFL Rules state in Rule 1, Section 4: \\"The ball is dead ‚Ä¶ When the quarterback, in possession of the ball, intentionally kneels on the ground during the last three minutes of a half\\". The Statistical Scoring Rules, Section 5(e) states: \\"When a quarterback voluntarily drops to one knee and concedes yards in an effort to run out the clock, the yards lost will be charged under Team Losses.

He is most famous for his torture at the hands of the Chalcedonian Byzantines, for his witness of the Arab invasion of Egypt, and for having built the monastery that carries his name in Mount Qalamoun. He carries the label \\"confessor\\" because he endured torture for his Christian faith, but was not a martyr. The manuscripts of the Coptic text known as the Apocalypse of Samuel of Kalamoun give his name as the author.  Early Life  Samuel was born in 597 AD in the city of Daklube, Egypt, to a non-Chalcedonian priest called Arselaos. He spent most of his early years as a disciple of Saint Agathon. While at the Monastery of Saint Macarius, a Byzantine imperial envoy attempted to convince the desert monks to confess the Chalcedonian faith. St. Samuel became zealous and seized the imperial letter and rent it into pieces saying \\"Excommunicated is this tome and everyone who believes in it, and cursed is everyone who might change the Orthodox faith of our Holy Fathers.\\" Seized with anger, the envoy ordered Samuel to be beaten with pins and to be hanged up by his arms, and that his face be smitten. One of the strikes enucleated one of his eyes. Samuel was also beaten by Cyrus, the Chalcedonian patriarch of Alexandria. The latter also ordered Samuel to be driven away from the Nitrian Desert. After leaving Scetes, Samuel dwelt in Mount Qalamoun, currently in the Upper Egyptian governorate of Minya. At Mount Qalamoun, Samuel founded a monastery that carries his name, and still exists to this day. Samuel also suffered at the hands of sun-worshiping Berbers who took him captive for some time. In his captivity, he met and befriended Youannis the Archpriest of Scetes, who was also captured by the Berbers. When the Berbers failed to convince Samuel to worship the sun, they tied his leg with an iron chain to that of a maiden, and sent them to attend the camels, hoping that the maiden would seduce Samuel and win him as a sun-worshipper. Yet, Samuel did not deny his faith and remained strong in his Christian faith. Eventually, after healing his master's son who was on the verge of death, he was released and permitted to return to Mount Qalamoun. After his return, he prophesied about and witnessed the Arab invasion of Egypt in 641 AD. Samuel the Confessor departed on 8 Koiak 412 AM (17 December 695 AD).

All WWF \\"scratch\\" logos and references to the initials WWF had to be blurred or edited out. However, the words \\"World Wrestling Federation\\" were not edited, and the old WWF logo was not blurred. In addition, the UK exclusive WWE Tagged Classics did not have any edits or censoring of the WWF initials. Some of the early WWE home video releases were also not edited (such as The Rock Just Bring It; the 2002 editions of Backlash and Insurrextion also featured the WWE digital on-screen graphics inserted on top on the old WWF one). Some of the videos/DVDs in question were just renamed with the WWE logo. In 2012, the WWE and the World Wide Fund came to an agreement which allowed WWE to use the Scratch logo in past photos and videos, thus ending the blurring on 'Attitude Era' PPVs and shows; in return, the WWE is not permitted to use any WWF logos in new, original footage. In late 2012 WWE announced FremantleMedia announced as new UK distributor, Nov 2012 that FremantleMedia would be handling all future WWE DVD, Blu-ray, and digital-file-based releases in Europe, replacing Silver Vision. Their official UK websitehttp://www.wwedvd.co.uk/ launched in January 2013 along with their initial releases - Night Of Champions 2012, Hell In A Cell 2012, Top 100 RAW Moments and The Attitude Era, all of which were issued on DVD and Blu-ray. Expansion of the video library With the expansion of the WWE Video Library, content has also been released from the vast library archives, including classic WWF, AWA, WCW, ECW, WCCW, and NWA content. Formats Content has been released exclusively in the DVD and UMD format (for selected documentaries only, until the format was discontinued) since mid-2005 (SummerSlam 2005 was the last VHS release). WrestleMania XXIV is the company's first show, and the first sports related event, to be released on Blu-ray Disc, being released in stores on May 20, 2008 as a 2-disc set; it was also the only pay-per-view released on UMD. Some content (primarily pay-per-views) are also available on Video CD format through certain licensors in some developing markets. Deal With Warner Home Video On November 19, 2014, WWE and Warner Bros. (the former corporate sibling of WCW) announced a multi-year deal for Warner Bros. Home Entertainment to distribute WWE titles in the home video market. The deal came as a result of the success the two had with Scooby-Doo! WrestleMania Mystery, as well as a Flintstones crossover and a sequel to the Scooby-Doo crossover. Additionally, despite remaining top-sellers, WWE Home Video releases had been in a decline in recent years due to streaming media services such as WWE's own WWE Network. The Warner deal took effect January 1, 2015, retaining the WWE Home Video banner. List of releases The following is a complete list of WWE Home Video releases on DVD.

Overview The quad-edge data structure: * represents simultaneously both the map, its dual and mirror image. * can represent the most general form of a map, admitting vertices and faces of degree 1 and 2. * is a variant of the earlier winged edge data structure. The fundamental idea behind the quad-edge structure is the recognition that a single edge, in a closed polygonal mesh topology, sits between exactly two faces and exactly two vertices. Thus, it can represent a dual of the graph simply by reversing the convention on what is a vertex and what is a face. Details The quad-edge structure gets its name from the general mechanism by which they are stored. A single Edge structure conceptually stores references to up to two faces, two vertices, and 4 edges. The four edges stored are the edges starting with the two vertices that are attached to the two stored faces. Uses Much like Winged Edge, quad-edge structures are used in programs to store the topology of a 2D or 3D polygonal mesh. The mesh itself does not need to be closed in order to form a valid quad-edge structure. Using a quad-edge structure, iterating through the topology is quite easy. Often, the interface to quad- edge topologies is through directed edges. This allows the two vertices to have explicit names (start and end), and this gives faces explicit names as well (left and right, relative to a person standing on start and looking in the direction of end). The four edges are also given names, based on the vertices and faces: start-left, start-right, end-left, and end-right. A directed edge can be reversed to generate the edge in the opposite direction. Iterating around a particular face only requires having a single directed edge to which that face is on the left (by convention) and then walking through all of the start-left edges until the original edge is reached.

Bean Spasms, Padgett's first collection of poems, was published in 1967 and written with Ted Berrigan.\\"Ron Padgett\\", Poets.org He won a 2009 Shelley Memorial Award.\\"About the Author: Ron Padgett,\\" Coffee House Press. Accessed May 31, 2014. In 2018, he won a Frost Medal from the Poetry Society of America.  Early life and education  Padgett‚Äôs father was a bootlegger in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He influenced many of Padgett's works, particularly the writer's refusal to obey rules, follow instructions, or even to follow his own emerging patterns. This would later be described as a stubborn streak of boyishness, allowing a wry, pickled innocence in his poetry. By the age of 13, Padgett started writing poetry. In an interview, the poet said that he was inspired to write when a girl he had a big crush on did not return his affection. In high school, Padgett became interested in visual arts while continuing to write poetry. He befriended Joe Brainard, who also became a leading poet but was focusing on visual arts at that time. They co-founded the avant-garde literary journal The White Dove Review. Collaborating with fellow Central High students Dick Gallup and Joe Brainard, along with University of Tulsa (TU) student-poet Ted Berrigan, Padgett solicited work for the White Dove from Black Mountain and Beat Movement writers such as Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, LeRoi Jones, E. E. Cummings, and Malcolm Cowley. Notably, The White Dove Review printed \\"The Thrashing Doves\\" by Jack Kerouac, \\"My Sad Self (for Frank O'Hara)\\" by Allen Ginsberg, \\"Crap and Cauliflower\\" by Carl Larsen, and \\"Redhead\\" by Paul Blackburn, among many others. After five issues, Padgett and his fellow editors retired the White Dove. In 1960, Padgett left Tulsa for New York, having been drawn to the New York School,Kline, Joshua.

During this period, he was interested in Pound, Rimbaud, the Black Mountain poets, and the Beats. In the same year, Padgett studied at Columbia University, where he earned a B.A. in 1964. In an interview, Padgett said that he went to Columbia partly because Ginsberg and Kerouac had gone there. He then studied creative writing at Wagner College with Kay Boyle, Howard Nemerov, and Koch. He was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship and studied 20th-century French literature in Paris from 1965 to 1966.  Career  Padgett was a poetry workshop instructor at St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery, New York, NY, from 1968 to 1969 and a poet in various New York City Poets in the Schools programs from 1969 to 1976. He was director of publications for Teachers & Writers Collaborative from around 1982 to 1999. He was also editor of Teachers & Writers Magazine from 1980 to 2000. Padgett was a cofounder and publisher of Full Court Press, for whom he edited from 1973 to 1988. He has lectured at educational institutions, including Atlantic Center for the Arts and Columbia University. He has also been the host of a poetry radio series and the designer of computer writing games.  Poetry  Padgett is the author of over twenty poetry collections, including Great Balls of Fire (1969, reissued 1990); You Never Know (2001); How to Be Perfect (2007); How Long (2011); and Collected Poems (2013). Several of Padgett's poems, including two written expressly for the film, are featured in the 2016 film Paterson,Lopez, N., \\"Meet the Poet Behind Adam Driver's New Film Paterson\\", Town & Country, Dec 29, 2016. which is about a poet named Paterson who lives in Paterson, N.J. The film's director, Jim Jarmusch, is a friend of Padgett. Like Padgett, Jarmusch studied poetry under Kenneth Koch at Columbia University. Padgett has collaborated with the poet Ted Berrigan and the artists Jim Dine and George Schneeman. He has also taught poetry writing to children.  Other works  Padgett is also the author of several collections of prose, including Blood Work: Selected Prose (1993), Ted: A Personal Memoir of Ted Berrigan (1993), and The Straight Line: Writing on Poetry and Poets (2000). His works on education and writing include The Teachers & Writers Handbook of Poetic Forms (editor), The Teachers & Writers Guide to Walt Whitman (editor), Educating the Imagination (co-editor), and many others. He was also the editor of the three-volume book called World Poets (2000). Padgett also translated French texts such as those written by authors Blaise Cendrars and Guillaume Apollinaire. Awards and honors In 1996, he was awarded a grant from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award. His book How Long was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2012 and his Collected Poems won the L.A. Times Book Prize in 2013. He was also the recipient of grants and awards for his translations, which include those given by the National Endowment for the Arts, the New York State Council on the Arts, and Columbia University‚Äôs Translation Center. *2013 Los Angeles Times Book Prize (Poetry) winner for Collected Poems *2015 Robert Creeley Award *2018 Robert Frost Medalist  Personal life  Padgett and his wife, Patricia Padgett, who also grew up in Tulsa, live in the same East Village railroad flat into which he moved in 1967.

Among Shaw's comic-book work is Hanna-Barbera's The Flintstones (for Marvel Comics and Harvey Comics), Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew (for DC Comics), and Simpsons Comics (for Bongo Comics). He was also the first artist for Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog comic book series. Biography Shaw began selling his artwork while still in his teens after choosing a career as a cartoonist. Throughout the 1970s, he contributed numerous stories to various underground comix. He also found work as an inker and then as a writer and penciller for a line of Hanna-Barbera comics which were originally published by Marvel Comics. Eventually, in 1978, he was hired to the Hanna-Barbera staff and became layout supervisor and character designer on NBC's The New Fred and Barney Show (starring the Flintstones) Saturday morning cartoon series. Shaw's first published work appeared in the underground comic book, Gory Stories Quarterly, He and Roy Thomas co-created Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! which first appeared in a special insert in The New Teen Titans #16 (Feb. 1982), followed by a series published from 1982 to 1983. Shaw both wrote and drew for Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog early on in the series' run. Most recently, he has become involved in the long-running litigation between Ken Penders and the publishers over copyright and character ownership. Shaw at the 1982 San Diego Comic-Con Shaw's work in TV animation includes producing and directing The Completely Mental Misadventures of Ed Grimley for Hanna-Barbera, starring Martin Short and Camp Candy for DiC, starring John Candy. He was also awarded four Emmy Awards for his work as a story director/storyboard artist on CBS' Jim Henson's Muppet Babies (Marvel Productions). Shaw has also worked on dozens of other cartoon series, including Krypto the Superdog, Johnny Test, What's New, Scooby-Doo?, Duck Dodgers, American Dragon: Jake Long, Teamo Supremo, Jimmy Two-Shoes, Class of 3000, Fantastic Four, Richie Rich, Popeye and Son, The Smurfs, The Snorks, Garfield and Friends and The Bungle Brothers segments of Tex Avery's The Kwicky Koala Show and many others.

A traiteur is Native Creole healer or a traditional healer of the French- speaking Houma Tribe, whose primary method of treatment involves using the laying on of hands. An important part of Creole folk religion, the traiteur combines Catholic prayer and medicinal remedies. They are called to treat a variety of ailments, including: earaches, toothaches, warts, tumors, angina, and bleeding. In the past, they substituted for trained physicians in remote rural areas of Acadiana. Most traiteurs consider their healing abilities a gift from God, and therefore refuse to accept payment in exchange for their services. Traiteurism is a very old tradition that is dying out, and very few traiteurs now exist. Traditionally, the rituals of the traiteur are passed down to the opposite gender. So a male must pass it down to a female, and vice versa. The traiteur must be asked to perform the treatments and will rarely offer them outright unless the need is great, and they can not ask for a payment of any kind, although it is acceptable to accept gifts for treating a person. However gifts for a true traiteur are never required. In Southern Louisiana, the co-existence of conventional medicine and traiteurs offers patients a range of resources for treating illness. Traiteurs and their patients do not view the two systems as conflicting. For example, if treating someone with a Coup-de-Soleil, or sunstroke, one would perform the ritual, then have the patient drink as much water as they could while lying down and then wiping the patient with a towel dampened in cool water. When a traiteur becomes ill, he goes to the doctor, yet he also employs week-long ceremonial candles (which are highly commercialized), Catholic Novenas (a Catholic rite involving nine days or weeks of recitation of a series of prayers), native traditional herbs, and perhaps a visit by another traiteur to get well. Some will use herbal remedies if they are known, the herbal remedies begin to cross over into voodoo being that both originated with the Creole people. Switching from one healing system to another is common among these practitioners and their patients, whose religious syncretism is matched by syncretism among medical systems. Another example of this fluidity is evident in the language with which the patients label their illnesses. Lousay A., a healer, is shown at his weekly home \\"clinic\\" hours one Saturday treating patients. One woman describes her condition as la mal angle, Louisiana French for shingles, while another woman explains that she has herpes zoster,\\" the medical term for the virus. Even in language, the traditional and the biomedical is heard to exist side by side without conflict. The rituals involved with traiteurism are simple and time-honored, and they are careful to not transgress the teachings of the Catholic Church. The methods of the traiteurs are purported to be able to work on a person regardless of faith, should one be so moved as to ask for a treatment. In popular culture * In the Band of Brothers episode \\"Bastogne\\", Cajun medic Eugene Roe tells fellow medic Ralph Spina that his grandmother was a traiteuse. This detail was invented for the show and has no basis in the real Eugene Roe's family history. * A video game of the same name is being created by Raconteur Games, though it does not specifically focus on Cajun folklore.

This show is also very well known to the Channel 8 viewer's community as the show with the \\"hot kiss\\" by Tay Ping Hui and Jeanette Aw. Synopsis Tay Ping Hui plays Wen He, a man who returns to Singapore with his daughter after spending some years in America, having contracted bone cancer. On his first day back, he bumps into Wen Qing, played by Jeanette Aw, who shouts at him angrily. Later, he sees an advertisement for a laksa eating competition. He decides to go as he was brought up eating laksa (his father started the family business selling laksa). There, he meets Wen Qing again. They go into the final round together, and Wen He eventually beats Wen Qing, which makes her hot temper flare up again. Wen Qing returns home and vents her anger on her two siblings, Wen Xin (Le Yao) and Wen Quan (Andrew Seow), and also on her father, Wen Shui (Ye Shipin). Later, Wen He finds the family unit and rings the doorbell. Wen Shui answers. Wen He is actually the adopted son of Wen Shui, although the rest of the family does not know this. He keeps his bone cancer a secret. Wen Shui welcomes him; however Wen Xin and Wen Quan do not. When Wen Qing realises who Wen He actually is, she gets even more upset and finds him a thorn in the flesh and cannot wait to kick him and his daughter out of the house. But Wen Shui is adamant about keeping Wen He and his daughter, and thus Wen Qing cannot do anything about it. Wen Qing runs the laksa stall. Wen Shui suggests for Wen He to assist her in running the stall as he was a chef back in the United States. There, he gets to know another stallkeeper by the name of Ding Zhenzhu (Cynthia Koh), who secretly has a crush on him. However, Wen He loves Wen Qing even though he is not supposed to. He is still under the impression that he is Wen Shui's real son. Wen Quan also has a hot temper like Wen Qing. He was initially an AVP at a premier bank, but however, he is soon kicked out and in need of finding a job. He demands the \\"secret recipe\\" of the laksa from Wen Shui, although Wen Shui keeps insisting there is no such thing, as the popularity of his laksa is based on the heart put into making it. Wen Quan turns the house over in an effort to find the \\"secret recipe\\". One day, however, he finds a letter which tells him that Wen He is not Wen Shui's flesh and blood. He releases this truth to the whole family, who then try to accept the fact. Now that Wen Qing and Wen He know that they are not blood-related, they start thinking about their relationship. One night, while Wen Qing is looking at an old picture of herself, she sees a cockroach on the floor and screams. Wen He rushes in, intent on helping her get rid of the cockroach. After a few seconds, Wen He locates the cockroach and places his hands directly over it, trapping it. In a moment of panic, Wen Qing places her hands directly above his in an effort to make sure the cockroach does not get away. They suddenly realise that their hands are in contact, and stare at each other confusedly. Wen Qing plucks up the bravery to kiss Wen He. At first, he moves away, but then surrenders to his feelings and they share a passionate and intimate kiss. The kiss kick-starts their relationship. However, Zhenzhu is unaware of this relationship and still harbours a crush on Wen He. On her birthday, Wen He happens to have a bracelet which he wants to give to Wen Qing after Wen Qing's bracelet broke. Zhenzhu thinks it is a birthday present and eagerly takes it. This makes Wen Qing angry and jealous. That night, Wen He tries to make it up to her by buying another bracelet and explaining himself. He is successful. However, Wen Xin happens to be standing near the lift lobby when Wen He puts on the bracelet for Wen Qing. She unwittingly discovers their relationship and leaks it out to Wen Shui. Wen Shui is very unhappy, and shouts at them. Wen Qing refuses to give in, due to her stubborn nature. Wen He moves out temporarily to ease the pressure. Meanwhile, Anqi (Teo Ser Li), Wen He's ex-wife, comes to Singapore to claim custody of her daughter. The Wens refuse to let her take the child back to Britain. Wen He unknowingly has an affair with Zhenzhu under the influence of alcohol. Soon after, Zhenzhu discovers she is pregnant. When Wen He finds out, he has no choice but to take responsibility. Wen Qing discovers what happened, and hits the roof. However, Zhenzhu miscarriages. Wen Qing reluctantly forgives Wen He. During the argument with the Wens, Anqi accidentally lets out the fact that Wen He has bone cancer. The Wen family is shocked. Wen Qing especially is sad, and her mind is in a chaos, trying to decide what to do. One day, Wen Qing comes in and comforts Wen He, who smiles and reassures her that he will be fine. Wen Qing leaves. Fifteen minutes after she leaves, Wen Qing starts to feel disoriented, and his vision becomes blurry. He dies peacefully, sitting in his chair. Later, Wen Qing comes back in to bring him out for dinner. When she discovers that he is dead, she weeps sorrowfully. On the day of his funeral, Wen He's daughter carries his photograph, while the rest of the Wen family stand behind her as they walk towards the coffin. When they have all finished paying their last respects, Wen Qing comes to the coffin. Her fingers brush the glass as she looks into the face of Wen He. She stares for a long, long while, and the tears start to fall.

David Faber during the Squawk on the Street in 2007 Squawk on the Street, which debuted on December 19, 2005, is a business show on CNBC that follows the first 90 minutes of trading on Wall Street in the United States. Originally airing as a one-hour program, the show doubled its airtime to two hours on July 19, 2007 (due in part to Liz Claman's departure from the network).mediabistro.com: TVNewser This replaced the first hour of Morning Call (later renamed The Call on August 8, 2007), which aired one hour later and had its airtime reduced in half. On October 17, 2011, Squawk on the Street was expanded to 3 hours, from 9am to noon ET. The Call was canceled as a result of this program's expansion. On May 19, 2014, Squawk on the Street reverted to 2 hours (9am to 11am ET) as a new program, Squawk Alley, debuted on that day. About the show Squawk on the Street, which is seen at 9:00am ET, is broadcast live at the New York Stock Exchange. Mark Haines and Erin Burnett were the original co-anchors at the NYSE. Haines (the original host of Squawk Box), died on May 24, 2011, 18 days after Burnett left CNBC (May 6, 2011) to host CNN's Outfront (see below Mark Haines). David Faber (who also hosts and contributes to his \\"Faber Report\\" segments) originally reported from CNBC Global Headquarters, while Haines and Burnett were in the \\"Squawk Nest,\\" or \\"Luxury Box\\" (as Haines called it) above the NYSE. Contributors include Bob Pisani (NYSE), Bertha Coombs and Scott Wapner.

Mad Money host Jim Cramer joined Quintanilla and Lee as a contributor for the first hour, with Hobbs joining Quintanilla and Lee as a third anchor for the duration. The following year (2012), Faber was moved from the network's Englewood Cliffs studio to a new trading-floor studio set (which replaced the old above-the-floor set that had been used since 2005) at the NYSE. The trading-floor studio set located in Post 9 at the NYSE, which debuted in 2012, is shared with Squawk Alley and Closing Bell. On April 1, 2013, Lee was removed from her anchoring duties on Squawk on the Street and continues on as anchor of Fast Money and Options Action.

From the 1860s he developed Merton Park as a garden suburb in Merton, Surrey. In his will, he left funds and part of his estate at Merton for the establishment of a horticultural institute. This institute, the John Innes Centre, continues to bear his name today. Family Innes was born on 20 January 1829 in Hampstead, Middlesex (now London Borough of Camden). He was the sixth of seven children of West Indies merchant John Innes (1786 - 1869) and his wife Mary Reid (1792 - 1849), a daughter of brewer Andrew Reid. The family owned sugar plantations in Jamaica and imported rum into England. They supported the anti-slavery campaign in the West Indies and eventually sold all the business interests. Innes was educated at boarding school in Brighton. Career Innes's early career was as a wine merchant in the City of London, but, in 1864, he founded the City of London Real Property Company with his older brother James. The company developed and managed office buildings in the City, but also purchased farm land in Merton in 1864 and created the Merton Park Estate Company. For his own home, Innes purchased Manor Farm. Around 1872, Innes became Lord of the Manor of Merton. On the Merton land, Innes developed a garden suburb with wide roads of houses designed by architect H G Quartermain between 1870 and 1904. In the 1890s, Innes's own house was rebuilt to a Quartermain design as the Manor House. As part of the promotion of the suburb, Innes arranged for the local railway station to renamed from Lower Merton to Merton Park in 1887. Innes was chairman of trustees of a charity established by William Rutlish, Embroiderer to Charles II, on his death in 1687. The charity's function was to provide funds to educate the poor children of the parish of Merton, but by the 1890s the charity had accumulated a considerable excess of funds. Innes used some of this excess to establish Rutlish School. John Innes remained a bachelor until his death on 8 August 1904 and was buried in the churchyard of St Mary the Virgin, Merton Park. He left most of the grounds of the Manor House to be converted into a public park for the benefit of the residents of the parishes of Merton and Morden. He left funds and his home, Manor Farm in Watery Lane, and its grounds for the creation of the horticultural institute which still bears his name, the John Innes Centre. His bequest to the nation was to be used for either a school of horticulture that would provide \\"technical instruction in the principles of the science and art of horticulture and the application thereof to the industry or employment of gardening\\", or a public museum for the collection of paintings and other works of art. In 1906, the trustees asked the Charity Commissioners to prepare a scheme and by 1908 the scheme was approved by both trustees and Board of Agriculture. On 12 January 1909 the scheme came into force and in 1910 the John Innes Horticultural Institution opened. The John Innes institute moved from Merton Park in 1945 and is now located in Colney, Norfolk, a world leader in plant science and microbiology. John Innes compost, now widely used in gardening, was developed by the centre. The grounds of Innes's home south of Watery Lane are now the site of Rutlish School, John Innes Park and John Innes Recreation Ground. The Manor House in Watery Lane, is used by the school and a blue plaque identifying it as his former residence was placed there in 1978.English Heritage - list of plaques A local conservation group, the John Innes Society, is dedicated to safeguarding and improving the built and natural environment in and around the Merton Park area.

It was created and written by Frank Provo and John Pickard. The show was seen on NBC. Storyline Actress Ann Flood starred as Elizabeth \\"Liz\\" Fraser Allen, a successful writer who had returned to her New England hometown of Strathfield to run her family's newspaper, the Strathfield Record. Her father, Ben Fraser, Sr. had suffered a heart attack, thus causing Liz, who had been living and working in Washington, D.C. to come home, leaving her D.C. fiance, Bruce Crawford. Another former beau, from her earlier days in Strathfield, Dr. Buck Weaver, eventually married his secretary, Maggie Barker. Her family included a brother Ben, Jr. who worked a family farm, was married to Italian Rose Corelli; had three children, including a son, named Dan, and didn't have much to do with the newspaper; and a sister Emily, who was married to Jim Benson and, after Jim's death, to Frank Teton. Jim and Emily had a daughter, named Lyddy, who worked with her aunt Liz on the newspaper. Liz's first adversary was wealthy Enid Chambers, who was the first wife of the man she would eventually marry, David Allen. Her later adversary was alcoholic actress, Lynn Franklin, who, despite her own marriage to Tom Jennings, was very much in love with David and wanted him for herself. Famous actors Several actors featured on From These Roots found fame in later shows. These include Henderson Forsythe (Jim Benson), who went on to fame as Dr. David Stewart on As the World Turns; Charlotte Rae (Hilda Furman), who played Molly the Mail Lady on Sesame Street during the show's third season; and then played her more well-known role of Edna Garrett on Diff'rent Strokes and The Facts of Life; Vera Allen (Kass), later played roles on Another World and Search for Tomorrow; Billie Lou Watt (Maggie Barker Weaver) who played Stu Bergman's second wife, Ellie Harper, on Search for Tomorrow; Audra Lindley (Laura Tompkins), best known as the first landlady, Helen Roper from Three's Company and its spin-off The Ropers (as well as Liz Matthews #3 on Another World; Millette Alexander (Gloria Saxon) later played roles on As the World Turns, Guiding Light and three roles on The Edge of Night; Robert Mandan (David Allen) who later played pompous and philandering stockbroker Chester Tate on Soap, the highly ineffective Colonel Fielding on the television adaptation of the movie, Private Benjamin and created the role of Sam Reynolds on Search for Tomorrow; Barbara Berjer (Lynn Franklin) who continued serial work, most notably on As the World Turns and Guiding Light; Richard Thomas (Richard), well known as John-Boy Walton #1 from The Waltons as well as other serial roles; Craig Huebing (Tom Jennings), later of General Hospital; Joseph Mascolo (Jack Lander), known for his roles as Stefano DiMera on Days of Our Lives and Massimo Marone on The Bold and the Beautiful; John Karlen, later known as Willie Loomis #2 on Dark Shadows; and Harvey Lacey of Cagney & Lacey; and John Colenback (Jimmy Hull) who played Henderson Forsythe's son, Dr. Dan Stewart, on As the World Turns. The show was directed by Joseph Behar, and Don Wallace and Paul Lammers, who were producers as well, along with Eugene Barr. It was also known for a storyline dealing with the show-within-a-show performance of Madame Bovary, which heavily featured the show's villainess, Lynn Franklin. A dispute between Wallace and Lammers with actress Julie Bovasso which ended up getting the latter fired from the show. Bovasso, who played Rose Corelli, Ben Fraser, Jr.'s wife, had a disagreement with a specific line's meaning, and she walked off the set. A line producer stepped in for her and did her roles that day. Bovasso was later fired and actress Tresa Hughes took over as Rose until the show's end in 1961. Cancellation The show was cancelled in 1961 because not many people felt at home with this kind of drama, which was unusual for serials of that time. This soap opera was more literary than most that were on the air at that time. The owner of the show, Procter and Gamble, sold the show to network NBC, which cancelled the program. As such, all the stories were wrapped up and ended happily. Ben, Sr. who had become Strathfield's mayor, had cleaned up the town of organized crime; Kass, the Fraser's lovable maid, had received a great big settlement from her late husband's estate; Lyddy had announced she was engaged; and Liz and her husband, David had achieved mutual success as writers.

Stecker also played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, New Orleans Saints, and Atlanta Falcons. He earned a Super Bowl ring with the Buccaneers in Super Bowl XXXVII. Mainly used as a backup for most of his career, Stecker started 14 games during his five years with the Saints, and also often served as a kick returner for both Tampa Bay and New Orleans. On April 20, 2010, Stecker announced that he was retiring from football,Tom Ziemer, \\"NFL: Stecker retires after 11-year run\\", Madison.com, April 15, 2010. although later in 2010, he worked out for, but did not sign with, the Green Bay Packers.Greg Bedard, \\"Packers' Jennings vents frustrations\\", Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, October 13, 2010.

His number, 27, has been retired. College career Stecker began his college career at Wisconsin in 1995. He spent two years with the University of Wisconsin, recording three 100-yard games, a 100-yard kick return for a touchdown, and a 63-yard punt return for a touchdown. In 1997, he transferred to Western Illinois after the emergence of future Heisman Trophy winner Ron Dayne pushed Stecker from his starting role with the Badgers. During the 1997 season, Stecker recorded 2,293 rushing yards en route to winning the Gateway Football Conference player of the year award. Stecker finished his career at Western Illinois as the school's all-time leading rusher, with 3,799 yards in just two seasons.

The show centered on a Miami Beach detective agency set on a houseboat and featured Troy Donahue as Sandy Winfield II; Van Williams as Kenny Madison (a character recycled from Bourbon Street Beat); and Lee Patterson as Dave Thorne. Diane McBain co-starred as socialite Daphne Dutton, whose yacht was berthed next to their houseboat. Spanish actress Margarita Sierra also had a supporting role as Cha Cha O'Brien, an entertainer who worked at the Boom Boom Room, a popular Miami Beach hangout at the Fontainebleau Hotel, directly across the street from Surfside 6. Surfside 6 was in fact a real address in Miami Beach, where an unrelated houseboat was moored at the time; it can also be seen in the sweeping aerial establishing shot of the Fontainebleau in 1964's Goldfinger. Description Cha Cha (Margarita Sierra) and Sandy (Troy Donahue) work on a dance routine. Surfside 6 was one of four detective TV series produced by Warner Bros. around that time, the others being 77 Sunset Strip (set in Los Angeles), Hawaiian Eye (set in Hawaii), and the aforementioned Bourbon Street Beat (set in New Orleans). Plots, scripts (changing the names and locales), characters, and almost everything else crossed over from one series to another, not a difficult feat since they were all actually shot on the studio's backlots in Los Angeles. Surfside 6 had a memorable theme song, written by Jerry Livingston and Mack David. The theme has often been parodied in popular culture. The lyrics varied from week to week, but \\"Surfside 6\\" and \\"In Miami Beach!\\" stayed intact. When the women were introduced, the melody picked up with back-up singers singing \\"Cha Cha Cha\\" when the announcer introduced Margarita Sierra, who vamped exaggeratedly and winked at the camera during this brief weekly sequence. In its first season, Surfside 6 was aired opposite the CBS sitcoms Bringing Up Buddy and The Danny Thomas Show and NBC's Western Tales of Wells Fargo starring Dale Robertson. In the second year, Surfside 6 competed against Danny Thomas and The Andy Griffith Show on CBS and NBC's short-lived, but highly acclaimed 87th Precinct starring Robert Lansing, a series about a fictitious New York City police precinct.

One paper described it as like \\"replacing a violin with a fiddle\\". It was given a Monday night slot at 8:30. In June it was given a timeslot of Monday 8.30 pm Reception According to one critic Surfside 6 \\"was one of TV's weakest shows. For the most part poorly written and not exactly endorsed by the Actors Studio. But the teenagers loved it.\\" The Los Angeles Times called it \\"inept\\". The show managed to be renewed for a second season. By April 1962 the show had been cancelled. Follow-up After the show was cancelled, Troy Donahue moved over to the cast of Hawaiian Eye to replace Anthony Eisley. Donahue played hotel social director Philip Barton. Also, a book was released, Surfside 6 by Jay Flynn (US, Dell 8388, October 1962). Margaret Sierra died in 1963 of a congenital heart condition. Van Williams went on to his own short-lived TV series (which later became a cult classic), The Green Hornet, which co-starred Bruce Lee, in 1966, four years later. The houseboat was damaged in 1964 when Hurricane Cleo hit Miami.

The Imperial forces loyal to Emperor Go-Daigo led by Kusunoki Masashige and Nitta Yoshisada attempted to intercept the Ashikaga forces led by Ashikaga Takauji in Settsu. The Ashikaga invaded from Kyushu after consolidating their forces at the Battle of Tatarahama and attacked the Imperial force at the Minato River from land and sea. The Imperial force was surrounded and destroyed by Ashikaga, killing Kusunoki and causing Yoshisada to retreat, and allowing the Ashikaga to march to Kyoto. The Battle of Minatogawa was a major defeat for the Imperial loyalists but became famous in Japanese mythology for the loyalty displayed by Kusunoki to the Emperor in the face of certain death and defeat. Background In February 1336, the defeat of the rebellious Ashikaga clan in the Nanboku-ch≈ç Wars forced Ashikaga Takauji to flee the capital Kyoto for the island of Kyushu. With this position of strength, the Imperial general Kusunoki Masashige had attempted to persuade Emperor Go-Daigo to seek peace with the Ashikaga. However, believing that the threat of the Ashikaga clan could be eliminated, Go-Daigo refused and ordered Nitta Yoshisada to assemble the force to defeat the Ashikaga armies. Yoshisada launched his campaign as ordered, but when Akamatsu Norimura sided with the Ashikaga he was led into a protracted siege defending Shirohata Castle in Harima Province. With the Imperial forces distracted by the siege, the Ashikaga had time to regroup and consolidate its forces in Kyushu by winning the Battle of Tatarahama against Imperial loyalists in April. Immediately, Takauji launched the counter- invasion against the Imperial forces, advancing into Honshu by land and sea. Yoshisada was informed of Takauji's advance and ended the siege at Shirohata Castle, attempting to find a better defensive position against the Ashikaga invasion by retreating to Hyogo. Battle Emperor Go-Daigo ordered Kusunoki to gather his force and to reinforce Yoshisada in Settsu despite the strategic flaws of the plan. Kusunoki proposed that the Emperor and Imperial forces hide on Mount Hiei near Kyoto, allowing the Ashikaga to enter the city and attacking from the mountain, trapping them and forcing them to defend the city while harassing their supply route. Go-Daigo rejected the proposal, refusing to leave Kyoto, and after failing to argue for the strategy, Kusunoki ordered his eldest son, Kusunoki Masatsura, back to his domain to continue the war before advancing to successfully join Yoshisada. The Imperial force had no naval force to prevent itself from being surrounded, but chose a defendable position near the Minato River and extended its troop east to attempt to prevent a landing from sea to the south. The Ashikaga force chose to encircle and destroy the Imperial force. The main land force led by Ashikaga Tadayoshi attacked the Imperials from the west to tie down Masashige, with Shoni Yorihisa launching a side attack from the south and Shiba Takatsune circling from the north to attack from behind. The landing of Hosokawa Jozen further to the east forced Yoshisada to avoid an encirclement by pulling back and Kusunoki was quickly surrounded with Takauji landing his naval force between two Imperial forces without any interference. Abandoned by the main Imperial force, the Kusunoki clan force was quickly overwhelmed and Kusunoki Masashige, his brother Kusunoki Masasue, and all his clansmen were subsequently killed. Yoshisada was forced back to Kyoto which was quickly abandoned as undefendable and Go-Daigo retreated to the religious sanctuary of Mount Hiei, which he had previously refused to do. The unimpeded force of Ashikaga clan entered Kyoto and enthroned Emperor K≈çmy≈ç, beginning the Northern Court-Southern Court rivalry of the Nanboku-ch≈ç period as Go-Daigo fled Kyoto to Yoshino. Cultural Significance The Battle of Minatogawa and series of battles are recorded with drama and exaggeration of accounts in Taiheiki, a historical epic which provides the wealth of information known to this period. During the Edo period, Kusunoki, despite only commanding a fraction of the Imperial force, became a figure of loyalty for choosing to sacrifice himself for the Imperial family against the impossible odds, with Tokugawa Mitsukuni writing the epitaph and Minatogawa Shrine consecrated in 24 May 1872 to cement his fame. The battle was commonly taught as a morality tale until the end of World War II, and Captain Goro Nonaka criticized the use of Ohka by 721st Naval Air Group comparing it to this battle as a sign of futility.

It is a non-denominational Church, which means it is often identified as being an Evangelical church and its doctrines resemble Charismatic and Pentecostal teachings. History Lighthouse Evangelism was founded on April 16, 1978. Pastor Rony Tan, with 8 other members commissioned by Jubilee Presbyterian Church conducted their first service at Chip Bee Centre. 24 people were present, most of them came as a result of the nine pioneers' door-to-door evangelism. The church has two church buildings, also known as healing centres. One is in Tampines and the other is in Woodlands. Lighthouse Evangelism Tampines (LET) was completed in 1992 and the first Sunday Service was conducted on August 9, 1992. At that time, the strength of the church was 700. LET could accommodate approximately 2,000 people in total. On August 9, 2003, Lighthouse Evangelism Woodlands (LEW) was opened and its inaugural service held. LEW was constructed to accommodate the church's growing congregation as by then, some people had to be turned away from the Sunday morning services in LET despite the fact that additional chairs were laid. The new LEW healing centre cost US$21 million (SGD 35 million) and it could accommodate approximately 4,000 people in total. In 2005, Lighthouse Evangelism's combined weekly attendance hit the 10,000 mark and as of August 2007, the church had a combined weekly attendance of 12,000. As of 2011, Lighthouse has an average service attendance of 15,000. The church is currently headed by Pastor Pacer Tan, who succeeded Pastor Rony Tan as the senior pastor of the church in 2018. Pastor Pacer is the son of Pastor Rony. Controversies=Pastor Rony Tan's Videos On February 8, 2010, Senior Pastor Rony Tan was called up by the Internal Security Department over video clips posted on the church's website. The video clips showed interviews with two church members who were ex-Buddhists and Pastor Rony Tan's comments in the video clips (including suggestions that Buddhism and Taoism were satanic) were deemed 'highly inappropriate and unacceptable' by the Ministry of Home Affairs as they \\"trivialised and insulted the beliefs of Buddhists and Taoists\\". The video clips have been taken down from the church's website and an apology has been issued by Pastor Rony Tan.

Biography Tsin Ting arrived in Hong Kong in 1949 with her brother after China came under communist rule. Left to fend for herself after her brother left for Taiwan, she sang in nightclubs to earn some money. In 1953, she recorded a Cantonese song, \\"One Day When We Were Young\\", on one side of a 78 but refused to do the other after finding her command of the language not up to par. In 1954, she auditioned for EMI Path√© when they were recruiting new talent but was told by composer Yao Min who auditioned her that her vocals lacked power and energy. She was offered instead, a part in the chorus. In 1956, she was signed on as a solo artist after Miriam Wang, the chief executive, took notice of her. Her first record was two songs from the Shaw & Sons film Narcissus, where she dubbed for actress Shih Ying. Her self-taught ability to read music was an added bonus as this saved valuable studio time. Film studios soon began using her to dub their musical films. During a recording session, director Li Han-hsiang (Li Hanxiang) heard her singing at the studio, dubbing a song for actress Yu Suqiu in the Shaw movie Lady in Distress (1957). Impressed with her voice, he had her dub for film star Lin Dai in his next film Diau Charn. The film was a great success all over Southeast Asia and won several Asian Film Festival awards. Thereafter, when Li went on to film The Kingdom And The Beauty, Tsin Ting was roped in to dub for Lin Dai once again. Tsin Ting dubbed many of Shaw Brothers' Huangmei Opera movies from the 1950s to the 1960s. The most notable was The Love Eterne (1963), where she sang for lead actress Betty Loh Ti (L√® D√¨ Ê®ÇËíÇ) in the role of Zhu Yingtai. The pathos and emotional impact of her singing, along with Loh Ti's excellent acting, moved viewers to tears. She left Shaw Studio as a contract singer in 1970 but continued recording albums on EMI in the 1970s, Wing Hung in the 1980s, and Polygram in the 1990s. In 2000, Tsin Ting made a remarkable career resurgence with soldout concerts at the Hong Kong Coliseum with Liu Yun, Tsui Ping and Wu Yingyin; she repeated the feat two years later with Liu, Wu and Billie Tam. In 2006, she was the guest singer at a Donald Cheung concert singing a famous Bai Guang classic and then duetting with Donald. This is available on DVD.

The movie The Fire Within from Louis Malle is based on this book. The movie Oslo, August 31st directed by Joachim Trier, released in 2011, is also largely based on Will O' the Wisp although the narrative takes place in contemporary Norway.

He came back strongly after two knee reconstructions, where he missed the entire 1996 season (and much of 1997). But he returned midway through 1997 to display incredible toughness in defence. He was, however, criticised for being a bad influence on some players with his heavy drinking and partying lifestyle. He was criticised by Jason Akermanis on The Footy Show, who later said that it was \\"no coincidence\\" that after Lawrence left the club at the end of 2000, the Brisbane Lions won a premiership the next year.

The film was directed by San Francisco filmmaker William C. Jersey and was nominated for Best Documentary Feature in the 1967 Academy Awards. The film was commissioned by the Lutheran Church in America. The film is shot in \\"cin√©ma v√©rit√©\\" style. It chronicles the relationship between the minister, L. William Youngdahl, and his white and black Lutheran parishioners. Youngdahl was the son of former Minnesota governor and federal judge Luther Youngdahl. The film includes a meeting between Youngdahl and a black barber, Ernie Chambers, who tells Youngdahl that his Jesus is \\"contaminated.\\" At one point another Omaha Lutheran minister, Walter E. Rowoldt of Luther Memorial Lutheran Church, says, \\"This one lady said to me, 'pastor', she said, 'I want them to have everything I have, I want God to bless them as much as he blesses me, but', she says, 'pastor, I just can't be in the same room with them, it just bothers me'.\\" Rowoldt and other ministers also discuss the concern that blacks moving into white neighborhoods will decrease property values. The attempt to reach out does not succeed and Youngdahl resigns as minister of the church. In 2005, A Time for Burning was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Chambers completed law school and was elected to the Nebraska Legislature in 1970. By 2005 he had become the longest-serving state senator in Nebraska history.

Common examples of the former include combat sports such as cockfighting and dog fighting and some forms of hunting and fishing. Activities characterized as blood sports, but involving only human participants, include the Ancient Roman gladiatorial games. Etymology According to Tanner Carson, the earliest use of the term is in reference to mounted hunting, where the quarry would be actively chased, as in fox hunting or hare coursing. Before firearms a hunter using arrows or a spear might also wound an animal, which would then be chased and perhaps killed at close range, as in medieval boar hunting. The term was popularised by author Henry Stephens Salt. Later, the term seems to have been applied to various kinds of baiting and forced combat: bull-baiting, bear-baiting, cockfighting, and later developments such as dog fighting and rat-baiting. The animals were specially bred for fighting. In the Victorian era, social reformers began a vocal opposition to such activities, claiming grounds of ethics, morality and animal welfare. Current issues=Online videos Many online video-sharing websites such as YouTube do not allow videos of animal bloodsports to be shown on the site. Animal fighting Cockfight Limitations on blood sports have been enacted in much of the world. Certain blood sports remain legal under varying degrees of control in certain locations (e.g., bullfighting and cockfighting) but have declined in popularity elsewhere. Proponents of blood sports are widely cited to believe that they are traditional within the culture. Bullfighting aficionados, for example, do not regard bullfighting as a sport but as a cultural activity. It is sometimes called a tragic spectacle, because in many forms of the event, the bull is invariably killed and the bullfighter is always at risk of death. Hunting and recreational fishing Animal rights and animal welfare advocates have extended the term blood sport to various types of hunting. Trophy hunting and fox hunting in particular have been disparaged as blood sports by those concerned about animal welfare, animal ethics and conservation. Recreational fishing has sometimes been described as a blood sport by those within the recreation. In fiction Blood sports have been a common theme in fiction. While historical fiction depicts real-life sports such as gladiatorial games and jousting, speculative fiction, not least dystopic science fiction suggests variants of blood sports in a contemporary or future society. Some popular works themed on blood sports are Battle Royale, The Hunger Games, The Running Man, The Long Walk, Fight Club, Death Race 2000, Amores Perros, Bloodsport, Danganronpa, and The Most Dangerous Game. Blood sports are also a common setting for video games (Unreal Tournament, Street Fighter, etc.), making up much of the fighting game genre. Developed science fiction universes such as Star Wars and Doctor Who feature different blood sports.

It is committed to a strong version of the perpetuity theory of Baptist origins, attributing an unbroken continuity and unique legitimacy to the Baptist movement since the apostolic period. It includes belief in the exclusive validity of Baptist churches and invalidity of non-Baptist liturgical forms and practices. It led to intense debates and splits in the Baptist community. History The movement began in the Southern United States in 1851, shaped by James Robinson Graves of Tennessee, and Ben M. Bogard of Arkansas.J. Kristian Pratt, The Father of Modern Landmarkism: The Life of Ben M. Bogard (Mercer University Press; 2013) The movement was a reaction to religious progressivism earlier in the century. At the time it arose, its proponents claimed Landmarkism was a return to what Baptists had previously believed, while scholars since then have claimed it was \\"a major departure\\". In 1859, the Southern Baptist Convention approved several resolutions disapproving of Landmarkism, which led to adherents gradually withdrawing from the Southern Baptist Convention \\"to form their own churches and associations and create an independent Landmark Baptist tradition.\\" The main baptist groups adhering to Landmark principles and doctrines in the present day are the churches of the American Baptist Association (founded by Ben Bogard), Baptist Missionary Association of America, and the Interstate & Foreign Landmark Missionary Baptist Association.  Major personalities = The Great Triumvirate  J.R. Graves = James Robinson Graves = Through his Tennessee Baptist newspaper, James Robinson Graves popularized Landmarkism, building for it a virtual hegemony among Baptists west of the Appalachians. He and Amos Cooper Dayton, who was also influential, were members of the First Baptist Church of Nashville, Tennessee. Graves was especially popular in the states of the lower Mississippi River Valley and Texas. In 1851, Graves called a meeting of like-minded Baptists at the Cotton Grove Baptist Church near Jackson, Tennessee, to address five questions: > # Can Baptists with their principles on the Scriptures, consistently > recognize those societies not organized according to the Jerusalem church, > but possessing different government, different officers, a different class > of members, different ordinances, doctrines and practices as churches of > Christ? # Ought they to be called gospel churches or churches in a religious > sense? # Can we consistently recognize the ministers of such irregular and > unscriptural bodies as gospel ministers? # Is it not virtually recognizing > them as official ministers to invite them into our pulpits or by any other > act that would or could be construed as such recognition? # Can we > consistently address as brethren those professing Christianity who not only > have not the doctrine of Christ and walk not according to his commandments > but are arrayed in direct and bitter opposition to them? The majority of the gathered Baptists resolved these questions by non- recognition of non-Baptist congregations, and then published their findings as the \\"Cotton Grove Resolutions\\". The \\"Cotton Grove Resolutions\\" essentially comprise the organizational document of the Landmark Baptist movement. = James Madison Pendleton = James Madison Pendleton was a Baptist pastor from Kentucky whose article An Old Landmark Re-Set, a treatise against pulpit affiliation with non-Baptist ministers, gave the movement its name. His Church Manual was also influential in perpetuating Landmark Baptist ecclesiology. Although Pendleton was the only native Southerner in the Landmark Triumvirate, he was in favor of emancipation and opposed secession. As a result, his influence among Southern Baptists declined precipitously in the days leading up to the American Civil War and he took a pastorate in Pennsylvania during the war. J.M. Pendleton = Amos Cooper Dayton = Amos Cooper Dayton's major contribution to Landmarkism was the novel Theodosia Ernest (1857), which expressed religious issues and was first published in The Tennessee Baptist.  Other influential Landmark Baptists  * John Newton Hall (1849‚Äì1905), publisher of the Kentucky Baptist Flag newspaper, was a forceful advocate of both Landmarkism and the Gospel Mission Movement. * Benjamin Marquis Bogard, after leading a schism out of the Arkansas Baptist State Convention became the most popular leader of Landmarkism into the twentieth century. * Samuel Augustus Hayden led a schismatic movement in Texas that many have associated with Landmarkism. * Thomas Treadwell Eaton championed Landmark sentiment in Kentucky and led the charge against anti-Landmark scholar William Heth Whitsitt. * John T. Christian prolifically defended the Landmark Baptist conception of Baptist successionism. * James Milton Carroll wrote one of the most enduring Landmark Baptist works, The Trail of Blood, a history of the Baptist movement. * A number of prominent Southern Baptist leaders were also Landmark Baptists although their primary contributions to Baptist history lay in fields other than ecclesiology.

Similar in appearance to a briefcase, they are primarily used to hold and transport official departmental papers. Red boxes are one modern form of despatch boxes, which have been in government use for centuries. Despatch boxes with a very different design remain in use in the chamber of the lower house of the British and Australian parliaments. Those boxes hold religious books for swearing-in new members of the chamber, but are also used as lecterns by front bench members. Ministerial boxes According to HM Treasury: Historical and famous red boxes The boxes are used by ministers on a daily basis while in government and thus become an important memory of their time in office, with many opting to buy and keep their red boxes. Many boxes owned and used by famous political figures from British history have been sold at auction. Those boxes represent some of the most important possessions of former prime ministers. Margaret Thatcher's ministerial dispatch box was sold at auction by Christie's in 2015 for ¬£242,500. Winston Churchill's red box was sold by Sotheby's in 2014 for ¬£158,500, 25 times the estimated price. Red boxes are often gifted to the outgoing President of the United States as a symbol of the relationship between the US and UK governments. George W. Bush received one such box from Tony Blair. Design  The boxes are manufactured by Barrow & Gale or Wickwar & Co to a design that has stayed the same for over a century. The boxes are constructed of slow-grown pine, lined with lead and black satin. The lead lining, which has been retained in modern boxes, was once meant to ensure that the box sank when thrown overboard in the event of capture. Also bomb-proof, they are designed to survive any catastrophe that may befall their owner. Each box takes three days to finish. They are wrapped in leather and employ a bespoke print, which is applied after curing and staining. Each box embossed in gold print with the royal cypher of the reigning monarch, the title of the owner and recipient of the red box, with the recipient's title given precedence. Each is also given a unique number to aid identification and control of the contents. Another unique feature of the boxes is the location of the handles on the bottom, opposite the hinges and the handle, so that when placed on a desk, the lock faces the recipient, who has the key and the authority to access the contents of the box. That also ensures the box is locked before being carried. Colour Two reasons have been given for the use of red as the predominant colour of the despatch boxes used in government. One is that Prince Albert preferred the colour because it was the predominant one on the arms of the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. However, it is also claimed that the practice began in the late 16th century, when Queen Elizabeth I's representative, Francis Throckmorton, presented the Spanish ambassador, Bernardino de Mendoza, with a specially-constructed red briefcase filled with black puddings. Today, although 'red box' has now come to be synonymous with the despatch boxes, other colours are also used, to denote the many different functions of the boxes in Parliament. Black is used for those boxes prepared for government whips and for discretion when boxes are designed for travel. A blue box with a red stripe is used specifically for confidential papers only seen by the prime minister, their private secretary, and intelligence officials. This box is known as \\"Old Stripey\\" due to the red stripe. Permanent secretaries, who are civil servants rather than MPs or Lords, have similar boxes but coloured green. These have exactly the same function as the ministerial red boxes. Barrow and Gale have also made available despatch boxes in green for members of parliament. William Hague, while Leader of the Opposition, had a blue box made for him with lettering denoting his office. It is not known whether a blue box is in use today. Cost One box cost ¬£865.43 to make in 2010. Between 2002 and 2007, the British government spent ¬£57,260 on new boxes. Budget box Gladstone's red box There is an annual custom of the Chancellor of the Exchequer holding up a red box to the press in Downing Street to symbolise the new budget of the UK government. Rather than containing the new budget, the red box contains the chancellor's speech and notes. The red box of William Ewart Gladstone, was made by Wickwar & Co for his first budget in 1853. Gladstone served as Chancellor of the Exchequer on four separate occasions and held the post for longer than anyone in the UK's history. Gladstone's red box was used by every subsequent chancellor until 2011, with the exceptions of James Callaghan (1964‚Äì1967) and Gordon Brown (1997‚Äì2007), who had new ones commissioned in 1965 and 1997 respectively: 51 chancellors for over 150 years. Gladstone's budget box was used by Alistair Darling (2007‚Äì2010) and by George Osborne in June 2010. It was then retired due to its fragility. It now normally resides in the Churchill War Rooms in Whitehall. The budget of the spring of 1868 was infamous for Chancellor George Ward-Hunt opening his dispatch box to find that he had left his speech at home. Since March 2011, a new budget box commissioned by The National Archives has been used. Royal red boxes Red boxes are delivered to the British sovereign every day (except Christmas Day and Easter Sunday) by government departments, via the Page of the Presence. The Queen's role as head of state means that she needs to keep abreast of what is happening in Parliament and the governments of all the other Commonwealth countries, as well as current events from around the world. Documents to which the monarch must give her signature and royal assent are delivered to her in red despatch boxes, which the Queen addresses daily. Singapore Early in the independence of Singapore, ministers had red boxes similar to the British ones, but with the coat of arms of Singapore. Education Minister Heng Swee Keat, formerly principal private secretary to Lee Kuan Yew, revealed in a Facebook post that Lee continued using the red box throughout his life until 4 February 2015, the day before his final hospitalisation. Sri Lanka Until the late 2000s the Minister of Finance used a red box with the national emblem to carry the Cabinet's annual budget plans, similar to the budget box of the British government.

A portion of the road is designated State Road 809 (SR 809), but most of the road within Palm Beach County is locally maintained and signed as County Road 809 (CR 809), while the Broward County section exists without either designation. Military Trail, like the paralleling Congress Avenue and Jog and Powerline Roads, is a popular commuting alternative to often-congested Interstate 95 (I-95), Florida's Turnpike, and U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in both counties. The state-maintained segment currently begins at an intersection with Lake Worth Road (SR 802) in Greenacres and terminates at PGA Boulevard (SR 786) in Palm Beach Gardens. CR 809 exists in two sections‚Äì‚Äìbetween PGA Boulevard and Jupiter and between Lake Worth Road and the Broward County line. These sections of Military Trail were part of SR 809 until 2004, when the state route was truncated, although there is seldom signage for the county road. Route description=Broward County Military Trail is an continuation of Andrews Avenue Extension, which itself is a continuation of Andrews Avenue (CR 811A) built in the 2000s. At an intersection with Sample Road (SR 834), Andrews Avenue transitions to Military Trail. For the first , the road is cosigned as Northwest 9th Avenue in the Deerfield Beach numbering system, before jogging to the east and intersecting Southwest 10th Street, which is an eastward extension of the Sawgrass Expressway (SR 869. Shortly after crossing Hillsboro Boulevard (SR 810), Military Trail bridges the Hillsboro Canal and enters Palm Beach County. Although this segment of Military Road is unnumbered, it is maintained by the City of Deerfield Beach from Northwest 54th Street to Hillsboro Boulevard and county-maintained elsewhere. Palm Beach County The southern segment of CR 809 begins at the Hillsboro Canal bridge. In Boca Raton. Throughout Palm Beach County, the road has a speed limit of and has three lanes in each direction, primarily serving shopping centers, malls, restaurants, businesses. Military Trail intersects Palmetto Park Road (CR 798), but not Glades Road (SR 808) due to an elevation change. Glades passes over Military Trail due to it being very close to the Tri-Rail tracks and Interstate 95, so access is provided by nearby service roads, which also serve the Boca Town Center. Military Trail also intersects Yamato Road in Boca, which exists east of CR 809 as SR 794 and west as CR 794\\\\. Still in Boca, Military Trail also intersects Clint Moore Road. As it enters Delray Beach, Military connects with Linton Boulevard (CR 782) and West Atlantic Avenue (SR 806), which provides access to downtown Delray. In Boynton Beach, the road intersects Woolbright Road (CR 792), Boynton Beach Boulevard (SR 804), and Gateway Boulevard. In Delray and Boynton, Military Trail also provides access to the many country clubs located off the road. In Greenacres, Military Trail intersects with Lake Worth Road (SR 802) and CR 809 transitions to SR 809. Signage along Lake Worth (SR 802) Road showing the transition of Military Trail to SR 809) SR 809 begins at the intersection of Military Trail and Lake Worth Road. SR 809 intersects Southern Boulevard (US 98 and SR 80) in a diamond interchange. For the next mile, SR 809 acts as the western border of Palm Beach International Airport, until intersecting with Belvedere Road. One mile north of the northern end of the airport, it intersects Okeechobee Boulevard (SR 704), a major intersection in the city. Continuing north, Military Trail passes by Northwood University to the east, and north of Community Drive, SR 809 becomes a service road for housing developments. Following an intersection with 45th Street (CR 702), SR 809 leaves West Palm Beach and enters Riviera Beach. There, it intersects with the Bee Line Highway (SR 710) and Blue Heron Boulevard (SR 708) at the outskirts of the West Palm Beach VA Medical Center. Continuing into Palm Beach Gardens, SR 809 ends at PGA Boulevard (SR 786). At PGA Boulevard, SR 809 terminates and Military Trail once again becomes CR 809. This designation continues for just under north to Indiantown Road (SR 706) in Jupiter. History Historically, SR 809 was long, extending from Palmetto Park Road (CR 798) to Indian Town Road (SR 706). With the exception of the section between Lake Worth Road and PGA Boulevard, the road was converted to a county road in 2004. Military Trail is named for the trail blazed by U.S. Army Tennessee and Missouri Volunteer forces, from a Fort in Jupiter, south to a Fort in Fort Lauderdale during the Second Seminole War.

Its products are shipped to all US states, overseas possessions and 195 countries. The Bakery was the recipient of the President's \\"E\\" Award.In Memorium - L. WILLIAM (BILL) McNUTT, JR. Early history The Collin Street Bakery in Corsicana, Texas The bakery was founded in 1896 by August Wiederman, an immigrant from Wiesbaden, Germany. With the help of local entrepreneur Tom McElwee, the bakery soon outgrew its original building, and required a new one in which the second floor was turned into a hotel. Celebrities such as Enrico Caruso and Will Rogers were sighted at the bakery, and in 1914 the Ringling Brothers Circus passed through town and ordered dozens of fruitcakes as Christmas gifts to be mailed to friends and family across the globe. In this way, the bakery entered the mail-order business. Lee William \\"L. W.\\" McNutt, Sr. (1895-1972), Harry Cook, and Bob Rutherford purchased the bakery in 1946 from August Wiederman. Mail order sales In reference to the mail order business started in 1947, bakery employees copied names and addresses from a myriad of phone books for \\"prospecting\\" list. Lee William McNutt, Jr. (1925-2006), initiated a direct marketing campaign to international customers. Under his direction, the bakery began accepting orders by mail, phone, fax, and online. He also pioneered the use of a computerized database and fine-tuned shipping methods to make delivery of the cakes more efficient. The third generation CEO, Robert Pritchett \\"Bob\\" McNutt (born 1957) has continued to refine all of these methods adopted by his father, L. W. McNutt. Thomas Max McNutt (born 1990), a graduate of Texas A&M; University in College Station, is the bakery vice president. A fourth-generation family member, he ran unsuccessfully for the Texas House of Representatives in the Republican primary election held on March 1, 2016. He lost by 222 votes to the long-term incumbent Byron Cook, also of Corsicana. Notable clients The descendants of the Ringling circus continue to order cakes. Monaco's Princess Caroline also places an annual order, continuing her mother, Princess Grace's tradition of a Christmas DeLuxe fruitcake for their family and friends. Hilton Hotels are a longtime customer, as is Master Builders, S.A. of Brussels, Belgium. Also counted in the above group is Madison Square Garden and Vanna White. The company rejected an order from Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini following the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis. The DeLuxe Fruitcake is shipped to all countries except Cuba and Iran. Collin Street Bakery Fraud and Movie In 1998, Collin Street Bakery hired a bookkeeper, Sandy Jenkins. Jenkins was promoted to the controller in 2004 when he earned approximately $50,000 per year. Before being caught in 2013, Jenkins embezzelled over $16 million. A movie about the scandal starring Will Ferrell and Laura Dern is in production. The film is titled Fruitcake. Statistics Fruitcake accounts for 98 percent of the bakery's total sales. The company sells about 3 million pounds of fruitcake each year, which equates to 1.5 million individual cakes. The majority of orders are placed by mail during October and November. Despite the heavy demand, the bakery does not have a distributor but sells its branded goods only through its well-known mail-order system, as well as at its two Corsicana stores and locations in Waco and Lindale. In the past some specialty supermarkets, such as the defunct Amarraca in Pittsburgh's North Hills, have sold a private label version of the fruitcake. As of 2018 you can purchase the fruitcakes in HEB, Tom Thumb and Albertson in North Dallas area. ReferencesExternal links * The Collin Street Bakery * Noland, Claire. (2006, September 16). L.W.

This article discusses the calculation of this premium in general. For further detail, see for discussion of the mathematics, Financial engineering for the implementation, as well as generally. Premium components This price can be split into two components: intrinsic value, and time value. Intrinsic value The intrinsic value is the difference between the underlying spot price and the strike price, to the extent that this is in favor of the option holder. For a call option, the option is in- the-money if the underlying spot price is higher than the strike price; then the intrinsic value is the underlying price minus the strike price. For a put option, the option is in-the-money if the strike price is higher than the underlying spot price; then the intrinsic value is the strike price minus the underlying spot price. Otherwise the intrinsic value is zero. For example, when a DJI call (bullish/long) option is 18,000 and the underlying DJI Index is priced at $18,050 then there is a $50 advantage even if the option were to expire today. This $50 is the intrinsic value of the option. In summary, intrinsic value: : = current stock price ‚àí strike price (call option) : = strike price ‚àí current stock price (put option) Time value The option premium is always greater than the intrinsic value. This extra money is for the risk which the option writer/seller is undertaking. This is called the time value. Time value is the amount the option trader is paying for a contract above its intrinsic value, with the belief that prior to expiration the contract value will increase because of a favourable change in the price of the underlying asset. The longer the length of time until the expiry of the contract, the greater the time value. So, : Time value = option premium ‚àí intrinsic value Other factors affecting premium There are many factors which affect option premium. These factors affect the premium of the option with varying intensity. Some of these factors are listed here: * Price of the underlying: Any fluctuation in the price of the underlying (stock/index/commodity) obviously has the largest effect on premium of an option contract. An increase in the underlying price increases the premium of call option and decreases the premium of put option. Reverse is true when underlying price decreases. * Strike price: How far is the strike price from spot also affects option premium. Say, if NIFTY goes from 5000 to 5100 the premium of 5000 strike and of 5100 strike will change a lot compared to a contract with strike of 5500 or 4700. * Volatility of underlying: Underlying security is a constantly changing entity. The degree by which its price fluctuates can be termed as volatility. So a share which fluctuates 5% on either side on daily basis is said to have more volatility than e.g. stable blue chip shares whose fluctuation is more benign at 2‚Äì3%. Volatility affects calls and puts alike. Higher volatility increases the option premium because of greater risk it brings to the seller. * Payment of Dividend: Payment of Dividend does not have direct impact on value of derivatives but it does have indirect impact through stock price. We know that if dividend is paid, stock goes ex-dividend therefore price of stock will go down which will result into increase in Put premium and decrease in Call premium. Apart from above, other factors like bond yield (or interest rate) also affect the premium. This is because the money invested by the seller can earn this risk free income in any case and hence while selling option; he has to earn more than this because of higher risk he is taking. Pricing models Because the values of option contracts depend on a number of different variables in addition to the value of the underlying asset, they are complex to value. There are many pricing models in use, although all essentially incorporate the concepts of rational pricing (i.e. risk neutrality) , moneyness, option time value and put-call parity. The valuation itself combines (1) a model of the behavior (\\"process\\") of the underlying price with (2) a mathematical method which returns the premium as a function of the assumed behavior. The models range from the (prototypical) Black‚ÄìScholes model for equities, to the Heath‚ÄìJarrow‚ÄìMorton framework for interest rates, to the Heston model where volatility itself is considered stochastic. See Asset pricing for a listing of the various models here. As regards (2) the implementation, the most common approaches are: * Closed form, analytic models: the most basic of these are the Black‚ÄìScholes formula and the Black model. * Lattice models (Trees): Binomial options pricing model; Trinomial tree * Monte Carlo methods for option pricing * Finite difference methods for option pricing The Black model extends Black- Scholes from equity to options on futures, bond options, swaptions, (i.e. options on swaps), and interest rate cap and floors (effectively options on the interest rate). The final three are numerical methods, usually requiring sophisticated derivatives-software, or a numeric package such as MATLAB. For these, the result is calculated as follows, even if the numerics differ: (i) a risk-neutral distribution is built for the underlying price over time (for non-European options, at least at each exercise date) via the selected model; (ii) the option's payoff-value is determined at each of these prices; (iii) the payoffs are discounted at the risk-free rate, and then averaged. For the analytic methods, these same are subsumed into a single probabilistic result; see . Post crisis After the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, counterparty credit risk considerations must enter into the valuation, previously performed in an entirely \\"risk neutral world\\". There are then three major developments re option pricing: *For discounting, the overnight indexed swap (OIS) curve is now typically used for the \\"risk free rate\\", as opposed to LIBOR as previously; see and Multi-curve framework. *Option pricing must consider the volatility surface, and the numerics will then require a zeroth calibration step, such that observed prices are returned before new prices can be calculated. To do so, banks will apply local- or stochastic volatility models, such as Heston mentioned above (or less common, implied trees). *The risk neutral value, no matter how determined, is then adjusted for the impact of counterparty credit risk via a credit valuation adjustment, or CVA, as well as various of the other XVA which may also be appended.

He is famous for his controversial attempts to create a human-ape hybrid by inseminating three female chimpanzees with human sperm (with no result). Biography Ilya Ivanovich Ivanov was born in the town of Shchigry, Kursk gubernia, Russia. He graduated from the Kharkov University in 1896 and became a full professor in 1907. He worked as a researcher in the Askania-Nova natural reserve, also for the State Experimental Veterinary Institute (1917‚Äì1921, 1924‚Äì1930), for the Central Experimental Station for Researching Reproduction of Domestic Animals (1921-1924), and for the Moscow Higher Zootechnic Institute (1928‚Äì1930). Around the start of the 20th century, Ilya Ivanov perfected artificial insemination and its practical usage for horse breeding. He proved that this technology allows one stallion to fertilize up to 500 mares (instead of 20‚Äì30 by natural fertilization). The results were sensational for their time, and Ivanov's station was frequented by horse breeders from many parts of the world. In the course of a general political shakeup in the Soviet scientific world, Ivanov and a number of scientists involved in primate research and experiments lost their positions. In the spring of 1930, Ivanov came under political criticism at his veterinary institute. Finally, on December 13, 1930, Ivanov was arrested. He was sentenced to five years of exile to Alma Ata, where he worked for the Kazakh Veterinary-Zoologist Institute until his death from a stroke on 20 March 1932. The renowned physiologist and psychologist Ivan Pavlov wrote an obituary for him. Human-ape hybridization experiments The most controversial of Ivanov's studies was his attempt to create a human-ape hybrid. As early as 1910, he had given a presentation to the World Congress of Zoologists in Graz in which he described the possibility of obtaining such a hybrid through artificial insemination. In the 1920s, Ivanov carried out a series of experiments to create a human/nonhuman ape hybrid. Three female chimpanzees were inseminated with human sperm, but he failed to create a pregnancy. In 1929 he organized a set of experiments involving nonhuman ape sperm and human volunteers, but was delayed by the death of his last orangutan. Orango opera His work was one of the sources of inspiration for the unfinished satirical opera, Orango whose Prologue was sketched in 1932 by Dmitri Shostakovich with a libretto by Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy and Alexander Osipovich Starchakov but the whole was later abandoned and discarded. The manuscript was found by Olga Digonskaya, a Russian musicologist, in the Glinka Museum, Moscow in 2004 and orchestrated by Gerard McBurney; this work was premiered on 2 December 2011 in Los Angeles, California by the Los Angeles Philharmonic under Esa-Pekka Salonen (conductor) and staged by Peter Sellars (director). In popular culture The first season, episode one, of the 2011 sci-fi and horror dramatized documentary television series, Dark Matters: Twisted But True, features a segment, titled \\"Ape-Man Army\\", in which the theories of Ivanov on human-ape hybridization are dramatized.

In December 1860 he married Juanita Lopez, a daughter of the Paredon Blanco settler Jose Francisco Lopez. The couple had three daughters. The eldest, Ida, became the mother of the later Los Angeles County Sheriff Eugene Biscailuz. As a deputy city marshal, at the end of 1861, Warren assisted J. E.

Parts of the right of way for the second South Pennsylvania Railroad were reused for the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Initial promotions The first South Pennsylvania Railroad was originally chartered as the Duncannon, Landisburg, and Broad Top Railroad Company on May 5, 1854. Its intended route began in Duncannon, passed through Landisburg and Burnt Cabins, and ended on the Juniata River via the Broad Top Mountain coalfields. On May 5, 1855, it was renamed the Sherman's Valley and Broad Top Railroad Company, and the planned eastern terminus was changed from Duncannon to the mouth of Fishing Creek, in Perry County near Marysville, in order to connect with the Pennsylvania Railroad. Another amendment to the charter on May 12, 1857, allowed it to connect with the Allegheny Portage Railroad and the Pittsburgh and Connellsville Railroad. Around this time, two miles of the proposed route were in fact graded. On March 31, 1859, it was given the grandiose name of Pennsylvania Pacific Railway Company, with the rights to extend into Maryland and Virginia. On April 1, 1863, it was renamed as the South Pennsylvania Railroad Company. Despite feverish promotion, including plans for 200 miles (322 km) of line from Marysville to West Newton (on the Youghiogheny River), no further work was completed. The two miles (3 km) of grading were sold off in 1872 and the charter became dormant on May 31, 1879. Vanderbilt syndicate=New York Central and Pennsylvania Railroad competition The unused charter of the defunct South Pennsylvania Railroad was revived in the 1880s as a weapon in a growing war between the New York Central Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad, the two major Eastern railroad systems. William H. Vanderbilt, who controlled the New York Central, learned that the Pennsylvania had obtained control of the New York, West Shore and Buffalo Railway, a newly built railroad whose line paralleled the route of the New York Central between New York City and Buffalo. Vanderbilt viewed the West Shore project as a Pennsylvania Railroad incursion into prime New York Central territory and a threat to the Central's supremacy in the area. To retaliate, Vanderbilt allied himself with Pittsburgh capitalists, including Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick, who were anxious to break the Pennsylvania Railroad's freight monopoly in Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania. Vanderbilt, the Pittsburghers, and other investors formed a syndicate to finance and build a new mainline railroad across the Alleghenies that would connect Pittsburgh with Harrisburg, and, working jointly with the Reading Railroad, would form a route to the East Coast. The group used the long-inactive charter of the South Pennsylvania Railroad as their vehicle to begin constructing the railroad.http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/America/United_States/_Topics/history/_Texts/HARROC/14*.html The route Rays Hill Tunnel during construction of the railroad tunnel in the 1880s. Andrew Carnegie is present in the middle of the image. The tunnel was later used by the Turnpike until bypassed in 1968. The new route for the railroad was surveyed beginning in 1881, and construction began soon after. The alignment, which had first been surveyed in the 1840s by Colonel Charles Schattler of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and then dismissed as a possible route for the Pennsylvania, crossed the spine of the Appalachians in southern Pennsylvania. It connected Harrisburg with the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, a Vanderbilt subsidiary, at Port Perry.https://archive.triblive.com/news/some-of-regions-historical-news- follows-railroad-that-never-was/ The so-called \\"southern route\\" of the South Pennsylvania was a treacherous one, as it crossed six mountain ridges, required nine tunnels, and involved numerous curves and steep grades. Construction continued into 1885 with considerable work done in drilling the tunnels and grading the portion of the route through the mountains. But as expenses rose, Vanderbilt began to have second thoughts and began looking for a graceful way out that would protect the investments made by his syndicate partners. He proposed a truce and buyout by the Pennsylvania, but the Pennsylvania's president, George Roberts, refused to meet his price. Cessation of work Banker J. P. Morgan, who was the New York Central's principal banker and a Vanderbilt ally, was also concerned about the financial effects of competition. He brokered an agreement in which the New York Central bought the West Shore Railroad, halted construction on the South Pennsylvania (including a bridge over the Susquehanna River at Harrisburg), and agreed to sell its right-of-way to the Pennsylvania. However, legal action prevented the Pennsylvania from taking control of the line, and the South Pennsylvania remained in limbo for almost 20 years. In the meantime, two short sections, including the Quemahoning Tunnel, were later used for local short line railroads (the Pittsburgh, Westmoreland and Somerset Railroad among them), but the majority of the line, including several unfinished tunnels, remained unused. It eventually came to be known as \\"Vanderbilt's Folly\\".British Broadcasting Corporation \\"Vanderbilt's Folly\\" In 1893, the Southern Pennsylvania Railway, a Pennsylvania Railroad subsidiary which had charter rights along the route, initiated court proceedings to take ownership of part of the South Pennsylvania grade. In 1895, it obtained title to the grade east of Mount Dallas. A little surveying and repair work was done on the route that year, but it was never used, and the grade was sold to the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission in 1938. In 1904, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad bought the South Pennsylvania grade west of Mount Dallas, organizing it under the name of Fulton, Bedford and Somerset Railroad. No railroad was ever built on the right-of-way, and it was also sold to the turnpike commission. Pittsburgh was originally a branch line until Carnegie and others intervened and persuaded Vanderbilt to discard the original alignment which was to go to Wheeling via Connellsville and Brownsville. Maps, letters and other documents including tunnel designs are open to the public in the state archives in Harrisburg. Pennsylvania Turnpike The route was revived during the Great Depression, when plans were made to build a superhighway across Pennsylvania. In 1937 the new Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission bought the old line from the two railroads, and in 1938 construction began between Carlisle and Irwin. Two of the workers from the South Pennsylvania Railroad project (one contractor and one laborer) also worked on the Turnpike despite the 54-year time difference in construction.Pennsylvania Highways: Pennsylvania Turnpike. Pahighways.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-23. The turnpike's original route was opened in October 1940, using six of the railroad's nine tunnels (subsequent route re-alignments have caused some of these tunnels to be abandoned), while the original Allegheny Mountain Tunnel wasn't used due to structural concerns and the Quemahoning Tunnel and Negro Mountain Tunnel were bypassed because advances in engineering since the 1880s allowed for bypasses. The highway engineers did not use most of the railroad's other grading, however, since they could afford steeper grades and shorter alignments. Because of this, relics of the \\"ghost railroad\\" may still be found all across the Alleghenies. Pittsburgh with Harrisburg.

Collegiate career A prolific frontcourt scorer while in college, Walker led the Virginia Cavaliers to their first Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament championship and its first NCAA Tournament berth in 1976. He was the only Cavalier to receive the Everett Case Award as the ACC Tournament's Most Valuable Player following Virginia's championship run, until Joe Harris in 2014. Enjoying one of the finest individual seasons ever by a Cavalier player during the 1975-76 season, Walker scored 21 points and grabbed seven rebounds in the 1976 tournament championship game against the University of North Carolina. Walker's scoring average of 22.1 points during the 1975-76 season ranks as the sixth best in Virginia history and his 1,849 career points is sixth on the all-time Cavalier list. He was a first-team Academic All American in 1976. His number 41 was retired by the school. The Portland Trail Blazers took him in the first round of the 1976 draft, the fifth overall pick. Playing career His playing career averages were 7.0 points and 3.1 rebounds during eight years with Portland, Seattle and Houston. He won two championship rings (with Portland and Seattle) in his first and third seasons. He was a starter for the Sonics in 1981-82 and the next season for the Houston Rockets. After ending his NBA career in 1984, Walker played 11 matches in Italian Pro League in Milan and then enrolled in Stanford Graduate School of Business, graduating in 1987 with an MBA. He worked for seven years at Goldman Sachs and also started his own money management business, Walker Capital, before returning to the NBA in the early 90s as a part-time television announcer and consultant for his former team, the Seattle SuperSonics, owned by Barry Ackerley. Front office Following the 1993-94 NBA season, Walker was named by Ackerley to be President and General Manager of the team. The Sonics continued their run of success for the next four seasons with a roster built primarily around Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp, Detlef Schrempf, Sam Perkins, Nate McMillan and Hersey Hawkins, with Hawkins as a Walker acquisition. In 1997-98, the Sonics won the Pacific Division with a record of 61-21 and Walker finished second in Executive of the Year voting. The Sonics average cost per win was 6th best in the league at $850 thousand per victory for the 1999-2000 season. During the 2003 season, Walker engineered a trade with the Bucks for star guard Ray Allen, along with Flip Murray, Kevin Ollie and a first-round pick that became Luke Ridnour, to the Sonics for Gary Payton and Desmond Mason. In 2004-05 the Sonics won the Northwest Division with a record of 52-30, the fourth Division Title that the Sonics won while Walker was team President, with a roster composed exclusively of players he acquired. During his 12 years as president, the Sonics selected future NBA starters and reserves Eric Snow, Mark Blount and Earl Watson, all in the second round. He signed free agents including Terry Cummings, Aaron Williams, Ruben Patterson, Reggie Evans, Antonio Daniels, Damien Wilkins and Jim McIlvaine, who despite fan derision helped the Sonics win its division in each of his first two years. Walker supervised the drafting of Rashard Lewis, who became an All-Star in 2005. He also served as President of the WNBA Seattle Storm, who won the WNBA championship in 2004.

They are most notable for featuring David Wojnarowicz, a famous artist, as a member.  History  In 1980, Brian Butterick, Jesse Hultberg and David Wojnarowicz worked as busboys at New York City's Danceteria on West 37th street, before the club was closed down for not having a liquor license. The Danceteria staff party was held at TR3 in Soho in December, 1980, and was 3 Teens Kill 4 No Motive's first performance. The poet Max Blagg chose the name from a New York Post headline, and performed with them along with others from Danceteria. Julie Hair joined the band for their 3rd show adding her rhythm machine making 3 Teens Kill 4 a stripped-down, 4-person ensemble. The band's signature style of found-sounds played on hand-held tape recorders, toy instruments, spoken word and multi-vocals, in a pop music context took shape. The low-tech tape sounds achieved the same results as sampling, and tape-looping, which were just starting to enter the pop music genre. As the band's only released album was getting started, the inclusion of Doug Bressler expanded the instrumentation to actual guitars as well as toys and Casios. Guitar, bass, keyboard, percussion, tape players, and toys were passed around on stage. Clarinet and flute were also used as was a microphone sewed into a glove, and a can of Beans. The band's performances had an anarchic intensity that relied on ambiance, and surprising sounds, more than actual music. In 1982, Alan Mace and Bobby Bradley, the managers of the Pyramid club, financed the self-titled, independently released album, 3 Teens Kill 4 No Motive. A cover of Chaka Kahn's Tell Me Something Good (written by Stevie Wonder), included the newscast of the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan. 3 Teens Kill 4's deconstructed version was typical of the harsh, reality-based attitude in their songs. Apart from rock clubs, they performed in non-rock venues such as the Civilian Warfare Gallery, Wigstock, and White Columns. The East Village, Manhattan was in its heyday of art and music. In 1983, Wojnarowicz left the band pursuing visual art, writing and film-making. He continued to collaborate on various projects with the members of 3 Teens Kill 4 before his death in 1992. In 1984, Bill Gerstel joined the ranks and for the first time the band had a drummer. They continued recording and performing for the next 3 years sharing the stage with a long list of artists from this era. DNA, James Chance, Bush Tetras, Soundgarden, Wall of Voodoo, Glenn Branca, Sonic Youth, ESG, Certain General, The Del-Byzanteens, Suicide, and Madonna. The band dispersed in 1987. All of the members continued writing, performing, producing art and recording. 3 Teens Kill 4 reunited in 2010 at the Mudd Club/Club 57/New Wave Vaudeville show at New York's Delancey Street Lounge. That night included the Bush Tetras, Tish and Snooky, The Comateens and Richard Lloyd from Television. In 2011, a multi-media show of music, dance, film, slides and live art called In Peace & War: 3 Teens Kill 4 had 3 nights at New York's HOWL Festival. The band was joined on stage by choreographer Ishmael Houston-Jones and Antony of Antony and the Johnsons along with numerous other artists, dancers and singers. The rarely seen film Beautiful People by Wojnarowicz was screened. In 2016, Bill Gerstel, the band's very human drummer, died after a long battle with cancer. In 2018, the re-released album 3 Teens Kill No Motive was included as a sound installation at the Whitney Museum's retrospective for David Wojnarowicz called History Keeps Me Awake At Night. The exhibit continued in 2019 in Europe. The band did their last performance on September 26th, 2018 for the closing of History Keeps Me Awake At Night at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Beloved co-founder Brian Butterick (aka Hattie Hathaway) died on January 30th 2019 after a 6-month battle with lung cancer.

The function of this premolar is assist the mandibular first molar during mastication, commonly known as chewing. Mandibular second premolars have three cusps. There is one large cusp on the buccal side (closest to the cheek) of the tooth. The lingual cusps (located nearer the tongue) are well developed and functional (which refers to cusps assisting during chewing). Therefore, whereas the mandibular first premolar resembles a small canine, the mandibular second premolar is more alike to the first molar. There are no deciduous (baby) mandibular premolars. Instead, the teeth that precede the permanent mandibular premolars are the deciduous mandibular molars. Anatomy: The mandibular second premolar most commonly has three cusps but can have two as well. The three cusp variety has one large cusp on the buccal with two smaller lingual cusps. The mesiolingual cusp is twice the size of the distolingual cusp. Viewed from the occlusal (looking down onto the biting surface of the tooth) the tooth is rather square in outline, particularly on the lingual. The occlusal table (the area bounded by the cusps, cusp ridges, and marginal ridges) is rectangular. The groove pattern is shaped like a ‚ÄúY‚Äù with the tail pointed to the lingual and placed between the distolingual and mesiolingual cusps one third of the distance form the distal to the mesial. The contacts with the adjacent teeth are positioned buccal to the midpoint. Viewed from the buccal the buccal cusp tip is centered mesiodistally. The buccal cusp ridges exhibit slight concavities that extend over the buccal surfaces as developmental grooves into the gingival embrasure. The contacts with adjacent teeth are in the occlusal third of the tooth with the distal height of contour slightly closer to the gingival than the mesial height of contour. The root is generally straight with slight curvature to the distal in the apical third. Viewed from the mesial or distal the buccal height of contour is in the gingival third of the tooth. The lingual height of contour is in the middle third of the tooth (not the middle third of the lingual cusp). When divided into thirds from the buccal height of contour to the lingual height of contour, the buccal cusp is at the contact between the buccal and middle thirds and the central groove is at the contact of the middle and lingual thirds. The two cusp variety generally has a groove pattern shaped like a ‚ÄúU‚Äù or ‚ÄúH‚Äù. Viewed from the occlusal it is more rounded in general and its lingual cusp is positioned slightly to the mesial, while the occlusal table remains squared. Viewed from the buccal the buccal cusp is centered over the root as in the three cusp variety. Viewed from the mesial or distal its heights of contour are similar to the three cusp variety. Sometimes, premolars are referred to as bicuspids. Even though the terms are synonymous, \\"bicuspid\\" refers to having two functional cusps, and the mandibular second premolar is an example of a premolar with three functional cusps. Thus, \\"biscupid\\" is technically not as accurate as \\"premolar\\". In the universal system of notation, the permanent mandibular premolars are designated by a number. The right permanent mandibular second premolar is known as \\"29\\", and the left one is known as \\"20\\". In the Palmer notation, a number is used in conjunction with a symbol designating in which quadrant the tooth is found. For this tooth, the left and right second premolars would have the same number, \\"5\\", but the right one would have the symbol, \\"‚îê\\", over it, while the left one would have, \\"‚îå\\". The international notation has a different numbering system than the previous two, and the right permanent mandibular second premolar is known as \\"45\\", and the left one is known as \\"35\\". It is a very common condition in orthodontics for a patient to have one or both mandibular second premolars congenitally absent. References * Ash, Major M. and Stanley J. Nelson, 2003.

Hamill currently serves as the forwards coach of St Kilda. Early life Having played rugby league, rugby union and basketball as a junior, Hamill first played Australian rules football in the Australian Capital Territory for the Tuggeranong Bulldogs Football Club. He attended Fadden Primary School, Marist College, Melrose High School and Phillip College (now Canberra College). He went to Melrose High School with Essendon and Richmond player Justin Blumfield. AFL career=Carlton Football Club Hamill was recruited late in the 1994 AFL Draft, with the 79th overall pick. Making his senior debut in 1996 with the Carlton Blues, Hamill was a favourite among supporters for his strong marking and goalkicking. He was a key part of the Blues 1997 pre-season premiership side and was also part of Carlton's runner up team in 1999. He played with Carlton from 1996 to 2000 with 92 games and 114 goals. At the end of the 2000 season he was traded to St Kilda, after having an argument with Carlton president John Elliott. St Kilda Football Club At the end of 2000 he moved to St Kilda, among other big name signings, such as Fraser Gehrig and Steven Lawrence. He was named captain of the Saints for the 2003 season and his influence for the team was unquestionable. He had a tough, uncompromising style, always committing himself to the contest. As a result, he sustained many injuries over his career, and midway through 2005 he missed a large part of the season with an assortment of hip, shoulder, and knee injuries. Due to the same array of injuries, he missed the entire 2007 season. Doctors advised Hamill that he should retire from the game due to the toll it takes on his body. Although he had the desire to continue, many coaches and medicos told him he was unable to continue. After seeking a trade mid season, he decided to retire, closing the book on an illustrious career at both Carlton and St. Kilda. Retirement On 3 October 2007 Hamill announced his retirement from AFL football. Hamill played 190 AFL matches with Carlton and St Kilda. In a career crippled by injury towards the end, he was remembered for his uncompromising attack on the football. He was a member of preseason premiership sides at both clubs. \\"The decision to retire has been one of the hardest to make in my football career. However, I felt it was in the best interest of the club moving forward\\", Hamill said. \\"This will now allow a younger player to step up and cement themselves in the St Kilda side ... I would like to thank my family and close friends for their support over the journey. I am grateful to the Carlton Football Club for providing me with the opportunity to play and develop as a footballer\\", he said. \\"Their inspirational leaders taught me to crave success and dedication to a cause, which will stay with me forever. I would also like to express my gratitude to Grant Thomas whose efforts did not go unnoticed by the playing group during his six years as coach.

He was an investigator of Nazi war crimes after World War II and the chief prosecutor for the United States Army at the Einsatzgruppen Trial, one of the 12 military trials held by the U.S. authorities at Nuremberg, Germany. Later, he became an advocate of the establishment of an international rule of law and of an International Criminal Court. From 1985 to 1996, he was adjunct professor of international law at Pace University. Biography=Early life, education, and army service Ferencz was born in Transylvania, which was part of Hungary at that time. A few months later, it was ceded to Romania under the Treaty of Trianon (1920), the result of World War I. When Ferencz was ten months old, his family emigrated to the United States which, according to his own account, was to avoid the persecution of Hungarian Jews by the Romanians after they had gained formal control of Transylvania. The family settled in New York City, where they lived on the Lower East Side in Manhattan.USHMM: Chief prosecutor Benjamin Ferencz presents his case at the Einsatzgruppen Trial, USHMM photograph #41618.

URL last accessed 2006-12-12. After his studies, he joined the U.S. Army, where he served in the 115th AAA Gun Battalion, an anti-aircraft artillery unit. In 1945, he was transferred to the headquarters of General Patton's Third Army, where he was assigned to a team tasked with setting up a war crimes branch and collecting evidence for such crimes. In that role, he was sent to the concentration camps that had been liberated by the U.S. army. Nuremberg trial prosecutor Benjamin Ferencz On Christmas 1945, Ferencz was honorably discharged from the Army with the rank of sergeant. He returned to New York, but was recruited only a few weeks later to participate as a prosecutor in the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials in the legal team of Telford Taylor. Taylor appointed him chief prosecutor in the Einsatzgruppen Case‚ÄîFerencz's first case. All of the 22 men on trial were convicted; 13 of them received death sentences, of which four were eventually carried out. In a 2005 interview for The Washington Post he revealed some of his activities during his period in Germany by way of showing how different military legal norms were at the time: Ferencz stayed in Germany after the Nuremberg Trials, together with his wife Gertrude, whom he had married in New YorkHarvard Law School: Benjamin Ferencz : Speaker's biography from the Pursuing Human Dignity: The Legacies of Nuremberg for International Law, Human Rights & Education conference, November 2005.

In 1956, the family‚Äîthey had four children by then‚Äîreturned to the U.S., where Ferencz entered private law practice as a partner of Telford Taylor.Ferencz, B.: Telford Taylor: Pioneer of International Criminal Law , Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 37(3), pp. 661 ‚Äì 664; 1999. URL last accessed 2006-12-13. While pursuing claims of Jewish forced laborers against the Flick concern (the subject of the Flick trial), Ferencz observed the \\"interesting phenomenon of history and psychology that very frequently the criminal comes to see himself as the victim\\". Role in forming the International Criminal Court Experiences just after World War II left a defining impression on Ferencz. After 13 years, and under the impression of the events of the Vietnam War, Ferencz left the private law practice and henceforth worked for the institution of an International Criminal Court that would serve as a worldwide highest instance for issues of crimes against humanity and war crimes. He also published several books on this subject. Already in his first book published in 1975, entitled Defining International Aggression-The Search for World Peace, he argued for the establishment of such an international court. From 1985 to 1996, Ferencz also worked as an adjunct professor of international law at Pace University at White Plains, New York. An International Criminal Court was indeed established on July 1, 2002, when the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court came into force. Under the Bush administration, the U.S. signed the treaty, but didn't ratify it. The administration of George W. Bush concluded a large number of bilateral agreements with other states that would exclude U.S. citizens from being brought before the ICC.Coalition for the International Criminal Court: 2006. Status of US Bilateral Immunity Acts. 2006. URL last accessed 2006-12-12. Ferencz has repeatedly argued against this procedure and suggested that the U.S. join the ICC without reservations, as it was a long-established rule of law that \\"law must apply equally to everyone\\", also in an international context. In this vein, he has suggested in an interview given on August 25, 2006, that not only Saddam Hussein should be tried, but also George W. Bush because the Iraq War had been begun by the U.S. without permission by the UN Security Council. In 2013, Ferencz stated once more that the \\"use of armed force to obtain a political goal should be condemned as an international and a national crime.\\" Later years In 2009, Ferencz was awarded the Erasmus Prize, together with Antonio Cassese; the award is given to individuals or institutions that have made notable contributions to European culture, society, or social science.Stichting Praemium Erasmianum: 2009: Antonio Cassese, Benjamin Ferencz .

The city's Deputy Mayor Saskia Bruines (International Affairs) traveled to Washington to symbolically present the street sign to Ferencz. On May 7, 2017, Ferencz was interviewed on CBS's 60 Minutes. In 2018, Ferencz was the subject of a documentary on his life, Prosecuting Evil, by director Barry Avrich, which was made available on Netflix. On January 16, 2020, The New York Times printed Ferencz's letter denouncing the assassination of the Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, unnamed in the letter, as an \\"immoral action [and] a clear violation of national and international law\\".

Pictured in the foreground is a synthesizer keyboard and a number of vinyl records; both of these items are key tools that producers and DJs use to create hip hop beats. Hip hop production is the creation of hip hop music in a recording studio. While the term encompasses all aspects of hip hop music creation, including recording the rapping of an MC, a turntablist or DJ providing a beat, playing samples and \\"scratching\\" using record players and the creation of a rhythmic backing track, using a drum machine or sequencer, it is most commonly used to refer to recording the instrumental, non-lyrical and non-vocal aspects of hip hop. Music production Hip hop producers may be credited as the record producer or songwriter, they may also supervise recording sessions. Hip hop instrumentals are colloquially referred to as beats or musical compositions, while the composer is called either a programmer, songwriter or beat maker. In the studio, the hip hop producer often functions as both the composer and as a traditional record producer. They are sometimes called Orchestrators, P. Diddy is an example of one, and they are ultimately responsible for the final sound of a recording and providing guidance to the artists and performers. As well as advising the audio engineer on the selection of everything from microphones and effects processors to how to mix vocal and instrumental levels.  History = 1980s  The Roland TR-808 drum machine was introduced in 1980, and consisted on an analog machine with step programming method. The 808 was heavily used by Afrika Bambaataa, who released \\"Planet Rock\\" in 1982, in addition to the electro hip hip groundbreaking classic \\"Nunk\\" by Warp 9, produced by Lotti Golden and Richard Scher, giving rise to the fledgling Electro genre. An especially notable artist is the genre's own pioneer Juan Atkins who released what is generally accepted as the first American techno record, \\"Clear\\" in 1984 (later sampled by Missy Elliott). These early electro records laid down the foundations that later Detroit techno artists such as Derrick May built upon. In 1983, Run-DMC recorded \\"It's Like That\\" and \\"Sucker M.C.'s,\\" two songs which relied completely on synthetic sounds, in this case via an Oberheim DMX drum machine, ignoring samples entirely. This approach was much like early songs by Bambaataa and the Furious Five. Kurtis Blow was the first hip hop artist to use a digital sampler, when he used the Fairlight CMI for their 1984 album \\"Ego Trip\\", specially on the track \\"AJ Scratch\\". The E-mu SP-12 came out in 1985, capable of 2.5 seconds of recording time. The E-mu SP-1200 promptly followed (1987) with an expanded recording time of 10 seconds, divided on 4 banks. One of the earliest songs to contain a drum loop or break was \\"Rhymin and Stealin\\" by the Beastie Boys, produced by Rick Rubin. Marley Marl also popularized a style of restructuring drum loops by sampling individual drums, in the mid 1980s, a technique which was popularized by the MC Shan's 1986 single \\"The Bridge\\" which used chops of \\"Impeach the President\\" on two Korg Delay/sampling triggered by a Roland TR-808. The Akai MPC60 came out in 1988, capable of 12 seconds of sampling time. The Beastie Boys released Paul's Boutique in 1989, an entire album created completely from an eclectic mix of samples, produced by the Dust Brothers using an Emax sampler. De La Soul also released 3 Feet High and Rising that year.  1990s-present  Public Enemy's Bomb Squad revolutionized the sound of hip-hop with dense production styles, combining tens of samples per song, often combining percussion breaks with a drum machine. Their beats were much more structured than the early more minimal and repetitive beats. The MPC3000 was released in 1994, the AKAI MPC2000 in 1997, followed by the MPC2000XL in 1999 and the MPC2500 in 2006. These machines combined a sampling drum machine with an onboard MIDI sequencer and became the centerpiece of many hip hop producers' studios. The Wu Tang Clan's producer RZA is often credited for getting hip hop attention away from Dr. Dre's more polished sound in 1993. RZA's more gritty sound with low rumbling bass, sharp snare drum sounds and unique sampling style based on Ensoniq sampler. With the 1994 release of The Notorious B.I.G.'s Ready to Die, Sean Combs and his assistant producers ushered in a new style where entire sections of records were sampled, instead of short snippets. Records like \\"Warning\\" (Isaac Hayes's \\"Walk On By\\"), and \\"One More Chance (Remix)\\" (Debarge's \\"Stay With Me\\") epitomized this aesthetic. In the early 2000s, Roc-a-Fella in-house producer Kanye West made the \\"chipmunk\\" technique popular. This had been first used by 1980s electro hip-hop group Newcleus with such songs as \\"Jam on It\\". This technique involves speeding up a vocal sample, and its corresponding instrumental loop, to the point where the vocal sounds high-pitched. The result is a vocal sample that sounds similar to the singing of the popular cartoon singing animals \\"Alvin and the Chipmunks\\". West adopted this style from J Dilla and the Wu-Tang Clan's RZA, who in turn was influenced by Prince Paul, the pioneer of the style of speeding up and looping vocal samples to achieve the \\"chipmunk\\" sound. Kanye West has used the \\"chipmunk\\" effect in many of his songs, and has been used in many other artists' music in the 2010s. During the course of the 2010s, many chart- topping hits revolved around music producers using digital audio workstation software (for example FL Studio) to create songs from sampled sounds. Some prominent music producers include Sonny Digital, Mike Will Made It, Metro Boomin, WondaGurl, Zaytoven, Lex Luger, Young Chop, DJ L Beats, Tay Keith, and the birth of music producing groups such as 808Mafia, Winner's Circle, and Internet Money.  Elements =Drum beat The drum beat is a core element of hip hop production. While some beats are sampled, others are created by drum machines. The most widely used drum machine is the analog Roland TR-808, which has remained a mainstay for decades. Digital samplers, such as the E-mu SP-12 and SP-1200, and the Akai MPC series, have also been used to sample drum beats. Others yet are a hybrid of the two techniques, sampled parts of drum machine beats that are arranged in original patterns altogether. The Akai MPC serieshttps://www.engadget.com/2017/01/22/akai-mpc-live-mpc-x/ and Ensoniq ASR-10 are mainstays for sampling beats, particularly by The Neptunes. Some beat makers and record producers are sound designers that create their own electronic drum kit sounds, such as Dr. Dre, Timbaland, DJ Paul & Juicy J, Swizz Beatz, Kanye West and The Neptunes. Some drum machine sounds, such as the 1980s-era TR-808 cowbell, remain as historical elements of hip hop lore that continue to be used in 2010s-era hip hop.  Sampling  Sampling is using a segment of another's musical recording as part of one's own recording. It has been integral to hip hop production since its inception. In hip-hop, the term describes a technique of splicing out or copying sections of other songs and rearranging or reworking these sections into cohesive musical patterns, or \\"loops.\\" This technique was first fully explored in 1982 by Afrika Bambaata, on the Soulsonic Force tape Planet Rock, which sampled parts of dance act Kraftwerk and experienced vast public acclaim.Marisa Brown.

The technique took a bi-coastal turn when discovered by a young Dr. Dre, whose first gig was the DJ of Afrika Bambaata- esque electrofunk group, the World Class Wreckin' Cru. In 1988, Dre began his use of sampling in hip-hop when he produced the N.W.A album Straight Outta Compton, a landmark in the genre of gangsta rap.Steve Huey.

On September 7, 2004, however, a U.S. Court of Appeals in Nashville changed the nature of musical copyright infringement by ruling that a license is needed in every case of sampling, where previously a small portion of the song could be copied without repercussion.9/10/2004 8:57:27 pm, foxxylady. \\"CAN HIP HOP LIVE WITHOUT SAMPLING?\\", SixShot.com.

As a result, more major producers and artists have moved further away from sampling and toward live instrumentation, such as Wu-Tang's. There were often questions of originality and authenticity that followed the use of sampling.

Samplers  Because hip hop production revolves around sampling, a sampler/sequencer combination device such as Akai's MPC line of grooveboxes usually forms the centerpiece of a hip hop production studio. Although mostly replaced by Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) by today, classics like the E-mu Systems SP-1200, Akai MPC60, Akai MPC3000 or Ensoniq ASR-10 still see use today due to their workflow and sound characteristics.  Turntables  The most widely used turntables in hip hop are Panasonic's Technics series. They were the first direct-drive turntables, which eliminated belts, and instead employed a motor to directly drive the platter on which a vinyl record rests.Trevor Pinch, Karin Bijsterveld, The Oxford Handbook of Sound Studies, page 515, Oxford University Press The Technics SL-1100 was adopted by early hip hop artists in the 1970s, due to its strong motor, durability and fidelity. A forefather of turntablism was DJ Kool Herc, an immigrant from Jamaica to New York City. He introduced turntable techniques from Jamaican dub music,Nicholas Collins, Margaret Schedel, Scott Wilson (2013), Electronic Music: Cambridge Introductions to Music, page 105, Cambridge University Press while developing new techniques made possible by the direct-drive turntable technology of the Technics SL-1100, which he used for the first sound system he set up after emigrating to New York in the 1970s. The signature technique he developed was playing two copies of the same record on two turntables in alternation to extend the b-dancers' favorite section, switching back and forth between the two to loop the breaks to a rhythmic beat. The most influential turntable was the Technics SL-1200.Six Machines That Changed The Music World, Wired, May 2002 It was adopted by New York City hip hop DJs such as Grand Wizard Theodore and Afrika Bambaataa in the 1970s. As they experimented with the SL-1200 decks, they developed scratching techniques when they found that the motor would continue to spin at the correct RPM even if the DJ wiggled the record back and forth on the platter. Since then, turntablism spread widely in hip hop culture, and the SL-1200 remained the most widely used turntable in DJ culture for the next several decades.  Synthesizers  Synthesizers are used often in hip hop production. They are used for melodies, basslines, as percussive \\"stabs\\", for chords and for sound synthesis, to create new sound textures. The use of synthesizers was popularized by Dr. Dre during the G-funk era. In the 2000s, Jim Jonsin, Cool and Dre, Lil Jon, Scott Storch, and Neptunes continue to use synths. Often in low-budget studio environments or recording rooms constrained by space limitations, the composer would use virtual instruments instead of hardware synthesizers. In the 2010s, virtual instruments are becoming more common in high-budget studio environments.  Recording  In hip hop, a multi-track recorder is standard for recording. The Portastudio cassette recorder was the law in the in-house recording studios in the 1980s. Digital ADAT tape recorders became standard during the 1990s, but have been largely replaced by Digital Audio Workstations or DAWs such as Apple's Logic, Avid's Pro Tools and Steinberg's Nuendo and Cubase. DAW's allow for more intricate editing and unlimited track counts, as well as built-in effects. This allows songwriters and composer's to create music without the expense of a large commercial studio. = Vocal recording = Generally, professional producers opt for a condenser microphone for studio recording, mostly due to their wide- range response and high quality. A primary alternative to the expensive condenser microphone is the dynamic microphone, used more often in live performances due to its durability. The major disadvantages of condenser microphones are their expense and fragility. Also, most condenser microphones require phantom power, unlike dynamic microphones. Conversely, the disadvantages of dynamic microphones are they do not generally possess the wide spectrum of condenser microphones and their frequency response is not as uniform. Many hip-hop producers typically used the Neumann U-87 for recording vocals which imparts a glassy \\"sheen\\" especially on female vocals. But today, many producers in this musical genre use the Sony C-800 tube microphone, vintage microphones, and high-end ribbon microphones tuned for flattering, \\"big\\" vocal expression. Many classic hip-hop songs were recorded with the most basic of equipment. In many cases this contributes to its raw sound quality, and charm.  Digital audio workstations  DAWs and software sequencers are used in modern hip hop production for the composer as software production products are cheaper, easier to expand, and require less room to run than their hardware counterparts. The success of these DAWs generated a flood of new semi-professional beatmakers, who license their beats or instrumentals preferably on digital marketplaces to rap artists from all around the world and caused the creation of a new niche market. Some Beatmakers oppose complete reliance on DAWs and software, citing lower overall quality, lack of effort, and lack of identity in computer-generated beats. Sequencing software often comes under criticism from purist listeners and traditional producers as producing sounds that are flat, overly clean, overly compressed, and less human because it's all computer-generated. Popular DAWs include the following: *Ableton Live * Acoustica Mixcraft *Adobe Audition *Apple's Logic Pro *Avid Technology's Pro Tools *Cakewalk SONAR *Steinberg Cubase *Image-Line's FL Studio *Propellerhead Software Reason *Sony ACID Pro *Apple's GarageBand *Motu Inc. Digital Performer *Cockos REAPER *Ardour  Live instrumentation  Live instrumentation is not as widespread in hip hop, but is used by a number of acts and is prominent in hip hop-based fusion genres such as rapcore. Before samplers and synthesizers became prominent parts of hip hop production, early hip hop hits such as \\"Rapper's Delight\\" (The Sugarhill Gang) and \\"The Breaks\\" (Kurtis Blow) were recorded with live studio bands. During the 1980s, Stetsasonic was a pioneering example of a live hip hop band. Hip hop with live instrumentation regained prominence during the late-1990s and early 2000s with the work of The Goats, The Coup, The Roots, Mello-D and the Rados, Common, DJ Quik, UGK and OutKast, among others. In recent years, The Robert Glasper Experiment has explored live instrumentation with an emphasis on the instrumental and improvisational aspect of hip hop with rappers such as Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Q-Tip, and Common as well as neo-soul singer Bilal Oliver. The drummers of hip hop Throughout history the drum set has taken numerous identities. It is the instrument that makes jazz \\"swing\\" and rock 'n' roll \\"rock.\\" With a new age of pop music on the rise within the past decade, it is easy to assume the drum set has been replaced by electronic sounds produced by an engineer. In reality, the drum set is the reason behind the production of these electronic beats, and live drummers contribute to modern day hip-hop much more than what meets the ear. An example of a drummer recording on a hip-hop record is Kendrick Lamar's album titled To Pimp A Butterfly which was released in 2015. Robert Sput Searight, drummer of Snarky Puppy, performed on the track's titled \\"For Free\\" and \\"Hood Politics.\\" The non-musician may find the use of a live drummer on a hip-hop recording unnoticeable, however, these musicians should receive credit for their work. The list below names some of the most influential drummers of the hip-hop genre.  Hip hop drummers  thumb * Questlove * J Dilla * Pharrell Williams * Tony Royster Jr * Chris Dave * Karriem Riggins * Adam Deitch  Instrumental hip hop  Instrumental hip hop is hip hop music without vocals. Hip hop as a general rule consists of two elements: an instrumental track (the \\"beat\\") and a vocal track (the \\"rap\\"). The artist who crafts the beat is the producer (or beatmaker), and the one who crafts the rap is the MC (emcee). In this format, the rap is almost always the primary focus of the song, providing most of the complexity and variation over a fairly repetitive beat. Instrumental hip hop is hip hop music without an emcee rapping. This format gives the producer the flexibility to create more complex, richly detailed and varied instrumentals. Songs of this genre may wander off in different musical directions and explore various subgenres, because the instruments do not have to supply a steady beat for an MC. Although producers have made and released hip hop beats without MCs since hip hop's inception, those records rarely became well-known. Jazz keyboardist/composer Herbie Hancock and bassist/producer Bill Laswell's electro-inspired collaborations are notable exceptions. 1983's Future Shock album and hit single \\"Rockit\\" featured turntablist Grand Mixer D.ST, the first use of turntables in jazz fusion, and gave the turntablism and record \\"scratching\\" widespread exposure. The release of DJ Shadow's debut album Endtroducing..... in 1996 saw the beginnings of a movement in instrumental hip hop. Relying mainly on a combination of sampled funk, hip hop and film score, DJ Shadow's innovative sample arrangements influenced many producers and musicians. In the 2000s and 2010s, artists such as RJD2, J Dilla, Pete Rock, Large Professor, MF Doom, Danny!, Nujabes, Madlib, Wax Tailor, Denver Kajanga, DJ Krush, Hermitude, and Blockhead have garnered critical attention with instrumental hip hop albums. Due to the current state of copyright law, most instrumental hip-hop releases are released on small, independent labels. Producers often have difficulty obtaining clearance for the many samples found throughout their work, and labels such as Stones Throw are fraught with legal problems.

Here a=1, b=100, and the minimum value of zero is at (1,1). In mathematical optimization, the Rosenbrock function is a non-convex function, introduced by Howard H. Rosenbrock in 1960, which is used as a performance test problem for optimization algorithms. It is also known as Rosenbrock's valley or Rosenbrock's banana function. The global minimum is inside a long, narrow, parabolic shaped flat valley. To find the valley is trivial. To converge to the global minimum, however, is difficult. The function is defined by f(x, y) = (a-x)^2 + b(y-x^2)^2 It has a global minimum at (x, y)=(a, a^2), where f(x, y)=0. Usually these parameters are set such that a = 1 and b = 100. Only in the trivial case where a=0 the function is symmetric and the minimum is at the origin. Multidimensional generalisations Two variants are commonly encountered.

For small N the polynomials can be determined exactly and Sturm's theorem can be used to determine the number of real roots, while the roots can be bounded in the region of x_i < 2.4. For larger N this method breaks down due to the size of the coefficients involved. Stationary points Many of the stationary points of the function exhibit a regular pattern when plotted. This structure can be exploited to locate them.

It stars Scott Marlowe and Gigi Perreau. Background The producer of the film, Elmer Rhoden Jr., was president of the Kansas City, Missouri-based Commonwealth Theaters, a prominent chain of motion picture theaters with stretched through Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota. Back in 1956, Rhoden Jr. had seen that teenagers were the best new audience for films (as television was drawing most adults out of theaters), and had come up with the idea of starting his own small film complex in Kansas City to produce low-budget teen exploitation films for these audiences, primarily for showing in drive-in theaters. Already, such teen films as Rebel Without a Cause, Earth vs. the Flying Saucers, I Was a Teenage Werewolf, and Rock Around the Clock had been huge successes. With $45,000 raised with the help of local businessmen, Rhoden Jr. hired Kansas City filmmaker Robert Altman to make the juvenile delinquency melodrama The Delinquents, which was sold to United Artists and released in 1957, grossing $1,000,000 and also firmly establishing Altman as a film director. After the success of The Delinquents, Rhoden Jr. put up about $170,000 for a second film in Kansas City. Rhoden Jr. began with thinking up a title and nothing else (The Cool and the Crazy) and, because Altman was directing television shows in Hollywood, Rhoden Jr. hired Kansas City writer and a friend of Altman's - Richard C. Sarafian - to write the screenplay for the film. Plot The Cool and the Crazy tells the story of Ben Saul, a reform school graduate who is transferred to a Kansas City high school. There, Ben's clowning in class ticks off the local gang of tough guys, but he soon wins all of their admiration when he begins buying them beer, taking them to dances, giving them \\"kicks,\\" and then finally turning them on to marijuana. Ben is working as a frontman for a local marijuana ring, but the local police detective is hot on his trail. When a marijuana-crazed addict teenager whom Ben has sold the drug to dies trying to hold up a filling station for drug money, the police question him and events begin to spiral out of Ben's control. In the dramatic (or melodramatic) finale, Ben ends up killing the pusher for more marijuana only to find that there is none, and gets his just deserts in a fiery car wreck. Then there is an obligatory moralizing segment, where a policeman screams at the surviving addicts, \\"Is this what you call 'kicks'?! Sooner or later, if you don't wise up you're all gonna wind up like this, one way or the other.\\" Cast Scott Marlowe as Bennie Saul. Richard Bakalyan as Jackie Barzan. Gigi Perreau as Amy. Dickie Jones as Stu Summerville. Shelby Storck as Detective Lt. Sloan. Marvyn J. Rosen as Eddie. Caroline von Mayrhauser as Miss Ryan. John V. Quijas as one of the fellows (Black Sweater) Production The film was shot in about two or three weeks on-location in Kansas City sometime in the latter part of 1957. The locations included a Kansas City high school, where most of the students got a chance to be in the film, a run-down Aberdeen Hotel in downtown Kansas City, a greasy spoon called Pat's Pig, Penn Valley Park and the Indian Scout Statue overlooking the city, the Blue Note Club, the renowned Kansas City Jazz hall, and several real homes and neighborhoods. Rhoden Jr. had cooperation from many local businesses and also from the Kansas City Police Department, who were contacted for several reasons. While standing on the street between takes, actors Dick Bakalyan and Dick Jones were actually arrested for vagrancy by Kansas City police. They spent several hours in the local jail before someone explained that they were just acting for a film. Like with The Delinquents, Rhoden Jr. had The Cool and the Crazy post- production and editing executed under professional conditions in Hollywood by Helene Turner. Rhoden Jr. also now had enough money to order an original music score, which was written and conducted by veteran film composer Raoul Kraushaar. Kraushaar's score featured recurring versions of the film's theme song, some which were done in a fast tempo and beat, and other versions that were performed in a slower, bluesier style. Rhoden Jr. had apparently already worked out a distribution deal with American-International. AIP made no mention of the drug plot in the trailer or on the poster, and tagged on disclaimers at the beginning and end assuring parents that this was a film made for the purpose of warning teenagers about drugs. The film was released in the spring of 1958, with the \\"gala world premiere\\" in Kansas City, which was accompanied by a live radio broadcast, house lights, live music, a dance contest, and a parade of the Kansas Citians involved in the film. Legacy The Cool and the Crazy was a great box-office success, grossing more than $5,000,000 for AIP and was hailed as one of the most popular delinquency films of 1958. The Cool and the Crazy has recently gained a devoted cult following for its rabid anti-marijuana message and Dick Bakalyan's performance. It first began to be shown on television in the 1970s, when it first began to attract its following, and was released on video the next decade.

He became interested in meteorology while working on the family farm. He was for many years a synodsman of the Brisbane diocese of the Church of England. Inigo married Marion Emma Comrie at Crohamhurst on 11 January 1905. Meteorology The Queensland Government meteorologist Clement Lindley Wragge was so impressed with Inigo's ability as a schoolboy that he recruited him as an assistant in 1888. Jones studied the variation in sunspot cycles that had been discovered by Eduard Bruckner, and came to the conclusion that anomalies were caused by the interaction of the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. This became the basis of his long-range weather forecasts, although he never claimed to be able to make day-to-day predictions. Although Jones failed to have his methods recognised as soundly based by any substantial body of accredited scientific opinion, he was widely recognised for his successes, especially by farmers. Inigo Jones became a full-time forecaster and lecturer in 1927 and founded the privately operated Crohamhurst Observatory in south- east Queensland. An Australian Senate hearing was told in 1938 that Jones was a \\"wonderful patriot\\" and that he was \\"held in the highest esteem by the big man and also the small man on the land\\". At the 11 January 1939 meeting of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science (ANZAAS) his ideas on cyclical variations theory was severely discredited, especially by Edward Kidson, the New Zealand government meteorologist, and yet farmers credited and worked their farms using his long-range forecasts. Later life Jones died at home on his farm at Crohamhurst, Queensland and was buried in the nearby Peachester cemetery. Legacy His assistant Lennox Walker expanded Jones' theories and continued marketing long range forecasts until 2000, when he passed the business over to his own son Hayden Walker. His Crohamhurst Observatory was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 2008.

A small target area is irradiated by a pair of deuteron beams to study the effects of intense neutron flux (produced by the interaction of deuterons with a stream of lithium) on materials. The International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility, also known as IFMIF, is a projected material testing facility in which candidate materials for the use in an energy producing fusion reactor can be fully qualified. IFMIF will be an accelerator-driven neutron source producing a high intensity fast neutron flux with a spectrum similar to that expected at the first wall of a fusion reactor using a deuterium-lithium nuclear reaction. The IFMIF project was started in 1994 as an international scientific research program, carried out by Japan, the European Union, the United States, and Russia, and managed by the International Energy Agency. Since 2007, it has been pursued by Japan and the European Union under the Broader Approach Agreement in the field of fusion energy research, through the IFMIF/EVEDA project, which conducts engineering validation and engineering design activities for IFMIF. The construction of IFMIF is recommended in the European Roadmap for Research Infrastructures Report, which was published by the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI).  Background  The deuterium-tritium fusion reaction generates mono-energetic neutrons with an energy of 14.1 MeV. In fusion power plants, neutrons will be present at fluxes in the order of 1018 m‚àí2s‚àí1 and will interact with the material structures of the reactor by which their spectrum will be broadened and softened. A fusion relevant neutron source is an indispensable step towards the successful development of fusion energy. Safe design, construction and licensing of a fusion power facility by the corresponding Nuclear Regulatory agency will require data on the plasma- facing materials degradation under neutron irradiation during the life-time of a fusion reactor. The main source of materials degradation is structural damage which is typically quantified in terms of displacements per atom (dpa). Whereas in the currently constructed large fusion experiment, ITER, structural damage in the reactor steels will not exceed 2 dpa at the end of its operational life, damage creation in a fusion power plant is expected to amount to 15 dpa per year of operation. None of the commonly available neutron sources are adequate for fusion materials testing for various reasons. The accumulation of gas in the material microstructure is intimately related to the energy of the colliding neutrons. Due to the sensitivity of materials to the specificities in the irradiation conditions, such as the Œ±-particle generation/dpa ratio at damage levels above 15 dpa per year of operation under temperature controlled conditions, material tests require the neutron source to be comparable to a fusion reactor environment. In steels, the 54Fe(n,Œ±)51Cr and 54Fe(n,p)54Mn reactions are responsible for most of the protons and Œ±-particles produced, and these have an incident neutron energy threshold at 0.9 MeV and 2.9 MeV respectively. Therefore, conventional fast fission reactors, which produce neutrons with an average energy around 1-2 MeV, cannot adequately match the testing requirements for fusion materials. In fact the leading factor for embrittlement, the generation of Œ±-particles by transmutation, is far from realistic conditions (actually around 0.3 appm He/dpa). Spallation neutron sources provide a wide spectrum of energies up to the order of hundreds of MeV leading to potentially different defect structures, and generating light transmuted nuclei that intrinsically affect the targeted properties of the alloy. Ion implantation facilities offer insufficient irradiation volume (maximum values of a few hundreds ¬µm layer thickness) for standardized mechanical property tests. Also the low elastic scattering cross section for light ions makes damage levels above 10 dpa impractical. In 1947, Robert Serber demonstrated theoretically the possibility of producing high energy neutrons by a process in which high energy deuterons are stripped of their proton when hitting a target, while the neutron continues on its way. In the 1970s, the first designs for high energy neutron sources using this stripping reaction were developed in the USA. In the 1980s, the rapid advances in high-current linear accelerator technology led to the design of several accelerator-driven neutron sources for satisfying the requirements of a high-flux high-volume international fusion materials testing facility. The Fusion Materials Irradiation Test (FMIT) facility based on a deuterium-lithium neutron source was proposed for fusion materials and technology testing. The deuterium-lithium reaction exploited for IFMIF is able to provide an adequate fusion neutron spectrum as shown by the comparison of IFMIF with other available neutron sources. In an experiment with 40 MeV deuterons from a cyclotron impinging on lithium, the neutron spectrum and the radioactivity production in the lithium were measured, and sufficient agreement with calculated estimates was found.U. v.

Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Report FZKA-6764 (2002) Download  Description  IFMIF will consist of five major systems: an accelerator facility, a Li target facility, a test facility, a post-irradiation examination (PIE) facility and a conventional facility.IFMIF International Team, IFMIF Comprehensive Design Report, IEA on- line publicationIFMIF Intermediate Engineering Design Report: IFMIF Plant Design Description document (not available on-line; delivered upon request at ifmif-eveda@ifmif.org) The whole plant must comply with international nuclear facility regulations. The energy of the beam (40 MeV) and the current of the parallel accelerators (2 x 125 mA) have been tuned to maximize the neutron flux (1018 m‚àí2 s‚àí1) while creating irradiation conditions comparable to those in the first wall of a fusion reactor. Damage rates higher than 20 dpa per year of operation could be reached in a volume of 0.5 l of its High Flux Test Module that can accommodate around 1000 small test specimens. The small specimen testing techniques developed aim at full mechanical characterization (fatigue, fracture toughness, crack growth rate, creep and tensile stress) of candidate materials, and allow, besides a scientific understanding of fusion neutron induced degradation phenomena, the creation of the major elements of a fusion materials database suited for designing, licensing and reliably operating future fusion reactors. The main expected contributions of IFMIF to the nuclear fusion community are to:A. Moeslang, Development of a Reference Test Matrix for IFMIF Test Modules, Final report on the EFDA Task TW4-TTMI-003D4, (2006) # provide data for the engineering design for DEMO, # provide information to define performance limits of materials, # contribute to the completion and validation of existing databases, # contribute to the selection or optimization of different alternative fusion materials, # validate the fundamental understanding of the radiation response of materials including benchmarking of irradiation effects modelling at length-scales and time-scales relevant for engineering application, # tests blanket concept and functional materials prior to or complementary to ITER test blanket module testing.  IFMIF Intermediate Engineering Design  The engineering design of the IFMIF plant is intimately linked with the validation activities and was conducted during the first phase of the so-called IFMIF Engineering Validation and Engineering Design Activities project (IFMIF/EVEDA). The IFMIF Intermediate Engineering Design Report was established in June 2013 and adopted by the stakeholders in December 2013. The IFMIF Intermediate Engineering Design defines the major systems in outline.  Accelerator facility (LiPac)  The two accelerator CW deuteron beams of 5 MW each impinge in an overlapping manner at an angle of ¬±9¬∞ with a footprint of 200 mm x 50 mm and a steady time profile on the liquid Li jet, with the Bragg peak absorption region at about 20 mm depth.  Target facility  The target facility, which holds the inventory of about 10 m3 of Li, forms and conditions the beam target. The Li screen fulfills two main functions: to react with the deuterons to generate a stable neutron flux in the forward direction and to dissipate the beam power in a continuous manner. The flowing Li (15 m/s; 250 ¬∞C) is shaped and accelerated in the proximity of the beam interaction region by a two-stage reducer nozzle forming a concave jet of 25 mm thickness with a minimum radius of curvature of 250 mm in the beam footprint area. The resulting centrifugal pressure raises the boiling point of the flowing Li and thus ensures a stable liquid phase. The beam power absorbed by the Li is evacuated by the heat removal system and the lithium is cooled to 250 ¬∞C by a serial of heat exchangers. The control of impurities, essential for the quality of the liquid screen, will be done through a tailored design of cold and hot trap systems, and purities of Li during operation better than 99.9% are expected. On-line monitoring of impurities will detect impurity levels over 50 ppm. Based on numerical analyses carried out in the last three decades, the beam-target interaction is not expected to have a critical impact on jet stability.  Test facility  The Test Facility will provide high, medium and low flux regions ranging from ‚Ä∫20 dpa/full power year (fpy) to ‚Äπ1 dpa /fpy with increasingly available irradiating volumes of 0.5 l, 6 l and 8 l that will house different metallic and non-metallic materials potentially subjected to the different irradiation levels in a power plant. More specifically, in the high flux region, fluences of 50 dpa in ‚Äπ3.5 years in a region of 0.5 l, together with power plant relevant fluences of ‚Ä∫120 dpa in ‚Äπ5 years in a region of 0.2 l, are planned. The high flux region will accommodate about 1000 small specimens assembled in 12 individual capsules independently temperature controlled that will allow not only mechanical characterization of the candidate structural materials tested, but also an understanding of the influence in their degradation with material temperature during irradiation.  Post-irradiation facility  The Post-Irradiation Examination facility, an essential part of IFMIF, is hosted in a wing of the main building in order to minimize the handling operations of irradiated specimens. It will not only allow testing irradiated specimens out of the different testing modules, but also characterizing metallographically the specimens after destructive testing.  IFMIF Engineering Validation Activities  Fig. 7. LEBT image of the deuteron injector of the Linear IFMIF Accelerator Prototype Accelerator (LIPAc) under installation in Rokkasho, Japan. To minimise the risks in constructing IFMIF, the IFMIF/EVEDA project has constructed or is constructing prototypes of those systems which face the main technological challenges that have been identified throughout the years of international cooperation in establishing a fusion relevant neutron source, namely 1) the Accelerator Facility, 2) the Target Facility, and 3) the Test Facility. An Accelerator Prototype (LIPAc), designed and constructed mainly in European laboratories CEA, CIEMAT, INFN and SCK‚Ä¢CEN under the coordination of F4E and under installation at Rokkasho at JAEA premises, is identical to the IFMIF accelerator design up to its first superconductive accelerating stage (9 MeV energy, 125 mA of D+ in Continuous Wave (CW) current), and will become operational in June 2017. A Li Test Loop (ELTL) at the Oarai premises of JAEA, integrating all elements of the IFMIF Li target facility, was commissioned in February 2011, and is complemented by corrosion experiments performed at a Li loop (Lifus6) in ENEA, Brasimone. A High Flux Test Module (two different designs accommodating either Reduced Activation Ferritic-Martensitic steels (RAFM) or SiC), with a prototype of the capsules housing the small specimens were irradiated in the BR2 research reactor of SCK‚Ä¢CEN and tested in the cooling helium loop HELOKA of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, together with a Creep Fatigue Test Module manufactured and tested at full scale at the Paul Scherrer Institute. Detailed specific information on the ongoing validation activities is being made available in related publications.

Modifications The general steps manufacturers undergo to convert a van differ greatly from one manufacturer to another. Modifications fall into two categories, the first is where the individual in a wheelchair is the driver and the second is where the individual in a wheelchair is a passenger. Conversions generally involve the following: *Some portion of the floor is lowered typically from the rear seats forward to the firewall *Floors are typically lowered 10\\" to 14\\" on a minivan for side entry accessibility and a standard 10\\" for a rear entry *An ADA compliant accessible van must meet certain requirements such as; a door height opening of 56\\" or greater, a ramp width of at least 30\\" in width, with ramp edges 2\\" high, and finally a ramp angle of a 6:1 ratio or rise *A rear entry converted minivan is widely used by NEMT or Non-Emergency Medical Transportation providers as the rear entry conversion provides the easiest provision to transport and accommodate wheelchair passengers *Rear entry converted vans are typically manufactured with a manual ramp, are ADA compliant and will accommodate 99% of all wheelchairs, scooters and people *Seating is modified to allow wheelchair access. In certain cases the front seats are removable allowing a wheelchair to be positioned in either the front driver or passenger position or ride amidships. Second row seats are removed altogether providing the lowered floor footprint allowing room for the wheelchair user to turn and sit in a forward-facing direction *Means of external access added (This is most often a ramp, lift, or rotating seat) A rotating seat or (Turney Seat) will lower outside the vehicle allowing the individual to ambulate from the vehicle seat to the wheelchair or vice versa. Turney Seats are not typically found on a lowered floor accessible van as they are utilized by people with reduced mobility not seated in a wheelchair 100% of the time *Suspension in the rear of the vehicle is typically raised via taller springs to allow extra weight and increased ground clearance partially compensating the lowered floor. Higher quality vehicles typically raise all four corners of the vehicle to preserve OEM driving characteristics. *A power kneeling system is often added to side entry conversions to reduce the slope of the ramp, however, is not necessary in all cases. The geometry of newer models allows the vehicle to maintain OEM ground clearance and ADA standards without a kneeling system. While power chair users are able to ingress and egress effortlessly because of the powered wheelchair, wheel slipping is a severe safety issue and so ramp angle is critical. *Most kneel systems are very simplistic in design as a stainless steel cable pinches the frame to the rear axle creating a lower angle for entry and exit. A modern system by FR Conversions retracts the suspension into the chassis body rather than compressing it, providing an exceptionally low effort entry for manual wheelchair users. Kneel systems are often recommended when the primary passenger is an unattended manual wheelchair user, usually is the driver of the vehicle or the typical usage evaluation indicates multiple entries / exits daily. NEMT, commercial or accessible Taxis are usually manual ramp, non- kneeling configurations. *Gas tanks and fuel lines may be modified, brake lines and mufflers rerouted, door panels extended, electrical systems modified, etc. Modifications are far more extensive in a side-entry conversion versus a rear entry. Typical converted vehicles come with a 3 year 36,000-mile warranty. One modern conversion (FR Conversions side entry Crosswind) comes with a 10 year 100,000-mile warranty. *Vehicle is certified to meet safety requirements of the country in which it is to be used. *Crash testing and or certification is not mandated by any governing authority. However any credible manufacture will crash test and certify with NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) to meet all vehicle safety crash test standards. *Tie- down points are added or referred to as L-track which is the receiver that the tie-downs or commonly used Q-Straint 4 point tie down system click(s) into in order to secure the wheelchair occupant. Regular and independent users of the same vehicle often use a docking lock device where an installed pin on the wheelchair docks into a crash-tested locking receiver. These devices, made by EZLock and Q-Straint, greatly facilitate loading and unloading. They are required for unattended wheelchair drivers. All wheelchair users must be secured with traditional seat belts while in the moving vehicle. Passenger conversions on buses or a full size van involve the following: *The floor is reinforced and floor applique is added. *Typically \\"L\\" track is installed on the floor, and in some cases ( in the Pro Master) on the walls, to accommodate tie downs, seat and shoulder belts. *Seats are added *AMF-Bruns of America, Q'Straint (or Wheelchair) tiedowns/securements are installed *Lift platform installed, can be in the side, rear or under the vehicle. *Windows installed (in some cases) *Van lining (finishing) Entry configurations There are two types of entry configurations: side-entry and rear-entry. The entry location impacts wheelchair seating positions, parking options, the ability to accommodate other passengers, and storage availability. Side entry Advantages of a side-entry configuration include: ability to drive from a wheelchair or sit in the front passenger position in a wheelchair or driver position; enter and exit curbside away from traffic; and more storage space. Disadvantages of this style are that it requires a handicap parking space or extra room for ramp deployment and that some driveways are not wide enough to accommodate the vehicle. About 65% of personal use wheelchair-accessible vehicles employ a side-entry configuration. Side entry vehicles can accommodate 5 passengers at most and typically are typically limited by total maximum load because of the extra weight of the conversion and often cannot seat more than 2-3 passengers based on total weight. Rear entry A rear- entry configuration can be used for attended applications in which the wheelchair occupant is not driving the vehicle but rather riding as a passenger. Rear entry vehicles are simpler, much less costly, require virtually no extra maintenance. Ride and drive quality are very similar to an unconverted vehicle. They will fit into any garage. Other advantages of a rear-entry vehicle is that, with the exception of parallel parking, no extra room is required for a ramp, and the side passenger doors aren‚Äôt blocked. In addition, mid-passenger seats can be mounted next to the wheelchair position. Other advantages include more ground clearance and more room for long wheelchairs and/or leg rests. One manufacturer (FR Conversions) makes a 48\\" wide RE ramp. The widest in the industry which can handle virtually any wheelchair. Rear entry vehicles are often converted from good used vehicles into a \\"Used / New\\" configuration which is much more affordable and places a wheelchair accessible vehicle within reach of many in need who otherwise could not afford one. It is a great 'starter\\" vehicle for consumers who are unsure of which configuration would work best and is a good entry point from a wheelchair carrier to one where transferring is no longer necessary. Limitations of the rear-entry style are the requirement to enter and exit from a traffic area although no special parking space is required. The inability to drive from the wheelchair and/or have the wheelchair in the front passenger position and less storage space are disadvantages. Rear entry vehicles are available in two configurations. Long cut and short or taxi cut. The long cut handles two wheelchairs the short cut one. Seating can be arranged so rear- entry vehicles can seat up to 6-8 passengers. Types of access=Ramp Ramp based modifications are most commonly performed on minivans. In order to provide access for the wheelchair user, the floor on side-entry vehicles is lowered . In rear-entry configuration, the floor is not lowered but rather removed, and a composite or steel tub is inserted. Ramps come in two styles‚Äîfold-up or in-floor‚Äîand two operating modes‚Äîmanual or motorized. Fold- up ramps fold in half and stow upright next to the side passenger door in a side-entry configuration or inside the rear access doors in a rear-entry configuration. Fold-up ramps present a lower ramp angle than in-floor ramps; however, in side-entry configurations, they are in the way of the passenger entrance when stowed. In-floor ramps slide into a pocket underneath the vehicle's floor and are only available for side-entry configurations. Folding ramps are available in manual or motorized versions for both entry configurations. Older style applications may also have a ‚Äúkneeling feature‚Äù that reduces the angle of the ramp by compressing the suspension of the van on the ramp side, newer ones using complex geometry eliminate the need for kneeling to meet ADA standards although they may employ a retracting system as an option, that eliminates the stress of compressing the suspension. Some other advantages of the fold-out ramp for the side entry vehicle are that an unaccompanied wheelchair driver can \\"Self Rescue\\" in the event of a system failure and not become trapped in the vehicle; ramp deployment onto a sidewalk or over a curb is sometimes only possible with a fold-out ramp because it will deploy out and over the curb; in very snowy climates the ramp remains inside the vehicle, away from the weather. A secondary disadvantage of the side entry fold-out ramp is that they rattle inside the vehicle. Modern, solenoid controlled ramps with actuators on both sides of the ramp are self tightening and eliminate the issue. The primary advantages of the in-floor ramp configuration are that ambulatory passengers have access to the vehicle from the curb side of the vehicle; and the ramp is stowed under the floor. The possible disadvantages are that the ramp is not able to overcome or deploy onto higher curbs, snow and ice may be retained in the ramp\\"tray\\"; not all models are ADA compliant because of the ramp's side edge height; self-rescue is not possible. In addition, portable ramps are available for use with many vehicles and typically do not require any vehicle modification. Portable wheelchair ramps cost much less both to purchase and to maintain. Since they are not attached to the vehicle, they can also be used for handicapped access for other applications. Minivans that are most frequently converted: * Dodge Grand Caravan & Chrysler Town & Country new production of these will end on early 2020. The Dodge Grand Caravan was the most common converted vehicle because of cost and length of the production run, the success, of the chassis. They will continue to be converted in the \\"Used / New\\" space for years to come. * Chrysler Pacifica, replacing the Town and Country and the more popularly priced Voyager (2020) are currently available and expected to replace the volume and position of the Grand Caravan in the wheelchair accessible conversion space. * Toyota Sienna is the second most converted chassis. It is due for some major updates in subsequent model years but is expected to retain its position in the market with several conversion configurations. * Honda Odyssey, a distant 3rd in market share in the market, is available from several converters in a side entry, in floor configuration and considered by some to be the most \\"upscale\\" of the chassis adapted for wheelchair use. Other much less common conversions include a Ford (Braun) and a Honda (VMI) SUVs and a Ford Transit Connect(Mobility Works). Full Size Vans * RAM ProMaster 2500 dominates the market because of its interior volume, capacity, front wheel drive, and ability to handle any size wheelchair. * The Ford Transit Some manufacturers also provide wheelchair accessible versions of their out going vehicles: * Luxgen7 MPVLuxgen V7 * Several converters (Rino & ATC) convert pick-up trucks Platform lifts Full size vans require lifts in the form of a platform that can be raised and lowered from inside the vehicle down to the ground outside. There are many types of lifts available on the market. Mono-arm lifts, double-arm lifts and under vehicle (UVL) lifts. Double-arm and underbody lifts are best-able for bigger vehicles such as minibuses or buses used for public transport. They have a bigger platform and higher load capacity so they are suitable even for heavy electric wheelchairs with a heavy occupant (more than 600lbs in all). A mono-arm Lift is preferable for private transport because it can fit smaller vehicles. A mono-arm lift is lighter and smaller than the other ones and it ensures a clear view when it is installed in the back of the car. Moreover, mono-arm lifts are preferable for the side-door installation because they are thinner than a double-arm. Other types Crane type lifts are combined with seats that turn and lower to the ground as a means of providing wheelchair access to some types of vehicles. Some companies offer the option of a \\"transfer seat\\", in which the front driver's or passenger's seat moves on a track back to the wheelchair's position allowing the wheelchair user to transfer into the OEM front seat and then move the seat back into its original position. The conversion is very simple and does not carry the complicated engineering and electronics typically found in a side-entry conversion. As a result, they are very well suited for commercial and heavy-cycle applications (i.e.-taxi, non-emergency ambulance, paratransit, assisted living, and dial-a-ride) and geographic areas prone to vehicle corrosion from salt and chloride usage on highways in winter seasons.

It was released on June 30, 1999, by Nippon Crown as his debut single, in a box edition. It was also available in a mini CD single edition, without additional material. All of the song's lyrics and music were written and composed by Gackt himself. Musically incorporating violin and modern rock instruments, with mixed pop-art rock sound, and recognizable emotional-metaphorical story, the song suggested his future musical expression.  Summary  In 1999, the 26-year-old Gackt Camui was living in Tokyo, and trying to set up his solo project. He was joined by his fellow Cains:Feel members, You Kurosaki who became the rhythmic guitarist and violinist and Ren Aoba who became the bassist of his live supporting band, also the others not-known members. Of them only Masa Shinozaki continued to be part of the support band. In February, Gackt travelled in Los Angeles, U.S. and France, to complete recording and filming. In April 1999, he held his first performance in 10 months called Gackt Easter Live - Resurrection, which was held in the Omiya Arche. It was a small event where he performed the song \\"Mizerable\\" live for the first time, as well talked with fans and announcing the upcoming national tour. \\"Miz√©rable\\" is the title song from the mini-album Miz√©rable, released one month prior. This was first released as a single box containing a mini CD with the song and instrumental track, along VHS of the title song's promotional video and making of. Nine days later a mini CD single version was released, containing no VHS. The song was included on the 2004 compilation, The Sixth Day: Single Collection.  Reception  The single box of \\"Miz√©rable\\" reached number 3 and charted for a total of 9 weeks, since its release, the single has sold 116,771 copies. It was Gackt's first single to enter the top ten singles chart position. The mini CD single version although managed to enter the charts, it failed to reach the top ten. It peaked at number 72 and charted for 6 weeks.

The species is native to southeastern Australia. Etymology Both the specific name, cunninghami, and the common name, Cunningham's spiny-tailed skink, are in honour of English botanist and explorer Allan Cunningham.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Egernia cunninghami, p. 63). Description It can reach up to 40 cm (16 inches) in total length (including tail), and may be confused with the blue-tongued lizards (Genus Tiliqua). Cunningham's spiny-tailed skink has a distinctive keel on each scale, which gives it a slightly spiny appearance. It is extremely variable in colour, ranging from dark brown to black, with or without blotchy patches, speckles, or narrow bands.Wilson, Steve; Swan, Gerry (2006). A Complete Guide to Reptiles of Australia, Second Edition. Sydney: New Holland Publishing. 512 pp. . Habitat It prefers to live communally in the crevices of rocky outcrops or hollow logs. Diet Cunningham's spiny-tailed skink is a diurnal omnivore, with its diet including insects, flowers, berries, fungi, leaves and young shoots. Conservation status There is currently research being done on the isolated population that inhabits the southern Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia. This population is considered vulnerable due to the fragmented (disjunct) distribution of the \\"colonies\\". There is evidence that at least one of these colonies has totally disappeared. It is more common within suitable habitat along the southeastern coast and ranges of Australia. Reproduction Like some other reptiles, it is viviparous, giving birth to six or more live young in a litter. Inbreeding avoidance Habitat fragmentation can affect a species population by disrupting core processes. One such process is inbreeding avoidance (avoiding inbreeding depression). The impact of habitat alteration (deforestation) on inbreeding was studied in the rock-dwelling Australian lizard Egernia cunninghami. Such populations in deforested areas experience potentially inbreeding-enhancing factors such as reduced dispersal and increased relatedness. However, active avoidance of close kin as mates was observed, as indicated by the substantially lower relatedness in actual breeding pairs compared to potential ones expected if there were random mating. This finding, as well as heterozygous excesses in immature lizards from disturbed (as well as undisturbed) habitats indicted that it maintains outbreeding in the face of increased accumulation of relatives.

Harold Ray Presley was one of six children born to Noah Edward Presley (1890-1969) and his 2nd wife named Christine. He attended local schools, but dropped out of school in the tenth grade. In 1968 he was drafted into the Army and served in Vietnam in the Twenty-ninth General Support Group. After serving four years, he received an honorable discharge and returned to Tupelo. Harold Presley was married, and had two sons and a daughter. Elvis Presley was his first cousin once removed. In 1993 he was elected sheriff of Lee County. During his tenure as sheriff, Presley received numerous awards including the Buford Pusser Award and the \\"Best of the Best Officers\\" for five years. Perceiving a need for battling both the demand and supply of illegal drugs, Mr. Presley initiated the DARE Program in local schools to educate young people, several twelve-step programs in the jail to help recovering addicts, and a tough approach to law enforcement regarding illegal drug sales and use. After earning his own GED, he provided GED classes for training and testing inmates; he also started a work-center program for the inmates in his jail. Presley was as famous for stopping the drug trade and drug traffic in Lee County, Mississippi, as Buford Pusser was for chasing down the State Line Mob and bootleggers in McNairy County, Tennessee, in the 1960s.

It parallels the nearby St. Lucie Canal, a navigable waterway connecting the lake and the ocean.

With the exception of Indiantown on the opposite (northern) side of St. Lucie Canal near the intersection of SR 76 and SR 710, very little human habitation exists along the southwestern of SR 76.

It is variously described, for example, as a walrus or as a three-eyed Loch Ness Monster-like creature.The legend of Mussie likely began around 1916, though legend claims that Canadian pioneer Samuel de Champlain wrote about it in the early seventeenth century. Mussie has become a part of the local culture and a fixture in the local tourism industry. Characteristics A depiction of the Loch Ness Monster, to which Mussie has been compared Mussie's name is a diminutive form of the name of its reported location: Muskrat Lake, a large, deep lake near the village of Cobden, Ontario, and about 75 miles northwest of Ottawa. Muskrat Lake is home to another paranormal phenomenon: local legends state that an Atomic Energy of Canada bus driver saw an extraterrestrial spacecraft landing on a spot atop a hill and leaving. There is indeed a dark-colored, circular outline on this hill where grass does not grow, with no widely accepted cause. There is no single accepted portrayal of Mussie's age, its gender, or even whether it is a single, long-lived creature or a species. Some residents claim that a single, very old Mussie‚Äîor a member of its species‚Äîfirst arrived in the area, then covered by the ocean, about 10,000 years ago. In this tale, glaciers and, later, solid landmasses built up around it, forming the lake, and Mussie was trapped. Mussie's diet, according to self-proclaimed observer Donnie Humphries, consists at least partially of cattails found near the edge of the lake. Descriptions of Mussie's physical appearance are inconsistent. In local folklore, it has variously been portrayed as akin to a walrus; a sturgeon or other fish; or a Loch Ness Monster with three eyes and sharper teeth. Another oft-cited description from local historian James F. Robison is as follows: History Cobden, Ontario during the winter The presence of a large, unusual creature in Muskrat Lake has been the subject of anecdotes since 1916. The creature's name was originally cited as Hapyxelor, alternately spelled Hapaxelor, but changed simply to Mussie, short for The Monster of Muskrat Lake, sometime later. Humphries, a man from Cobden, was a well-known proponent of Mussie's existence. Around the area, many people's knowledge of the creature come from his vehement, albeit inconsistent, tales of observing it once. Some residents claim that, independent of the truth of the Mussie legend, the legend's origins are older: supposedly, early settler Samuel de Champlain wrote of the creature's existence in the early seventeenth century. However, no concrete evidence of such writings has been uncovered, even though Champlain did write of loud screams from sea monsters living in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. Author Michael Bradley and friend Deanna Theilmann- Beann searched for Mussie in the Nepenthe, a boat with sonar technology. With their sonar, they found two creatures they hypothesized could be two marine mammals, three metres long. Bradley concluded that at least one creature compatible with Mussie's description lived in the lake, though he did not investigate the creatures further. Scientists have also surveyed the area and found nothing, though the definitive nonexistence of a Mussie-like creature is difficult to establish because some of the trenches in Muskrat Lake extend to over 60 metres. In culture Mussie has become a cultural mascot of the area, appearing on signs welcoming visitors to Cobden and in front of the Home Hardware store in the village. It is not usually portrayed as fearsome; it is given seasonal accessories to mark holidays, like a Santa Claus hat for Christmas. The creature's economic value through the tourism industry has caused it to be described as \\"recession-fighting\\" in local folk songs. Every year, visitors in the Muskrat Lake area search for Mussie in the lake. So far, none have yet captured conclusive evidence of its existence. In the 1990s, a tourism marketing campaign for the area offered CAN$1 million to anyone who could capture a live specimen, but no one did. Mussie is referenced in travel pamphlets for the Whitewater Region area; one suggests that it can be caught by a fishing rod.

As Iceland has had no standing military of its own since World War II, while Soviet threat heightened and thus requiring standing defences. After the Cold War ended, U.S. forces were constrained by the financial situation and were yearning to leave Iceland. While Icelandic politicians disagreed with such a move. Hence the Agreed Minute, signed in 1994 where both parties compromised and came to an understanding. The Agreed Minute was last renegotiated in 2001. At the time, the U.S. Air Force committed itself to maintaining four to six interceptors at the Keflav√≠k base, supported by a helicopter rescue squad. The Air Force, in order to cut costs, announced plans to remove the four remaining jets in 2003. The removal was then delayed to address Icelandic demands for continued presence of the jets. After an unfruitful series of negotiations and two reshufflings of the Icelandic government the issue lay dormant until early 2006 when the U.S. Air Force issued an official statement that withdrawal of the aircraft was already being prepared. U.S. officials have since then argued that Iceland is in no need of U.S. military presence and the last remaining airmen left Iceland during September 2006.

Measuring 2.200 square meters, it is all that remains of a country retreat, best known as Villa Ludovisi, established in the 16th century by Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte. The Cardinal was a diplomat, intellectual, art connoisseur, collector, and protector and patron of such very different figures as Galileo and Caravaggio. The Casino is often referred to as the Villa Aurora, after the important fresco by Guercino, located in the Villa's main reception room, depicting the goddess Aurora. One of the smaller rooms of the casino boasts the only painting ever executed by Caravaggio on a ceiling, Jupiter, Neptune and Pluto, which reflects, in symbolic imagery derived from Classical mythology, another of the cardinal's interests, alchemy. Del Monte sold the Villa Ludovisi and its extensive grounds to Cardinal Ludovico Ludovisi in 1621. Due to the Ludovisi's family financial duress, the whole park was sold off in the 1880s and built up with hotels and expensive houses, including palazzi for members of the family. The facade of the main casino or Casino Grande (a separate building) is now hidden behind the 19th-century Palazzo Margherita. This building was acquired by the Italian State and became the residence of Queen Mother Margherita. It now houses the U.S. embassy. The only part not sold was the Villa Aurora, which remains in the possession of the Ludovisi family, encircled by high walls and open to the public on written request. Apart from the works by Caravaggio and Guercino, it contains important works of art by Pomarancio, Michelangelo, and a collection of Roman and Greek artefacts.

There are many different definitions of weak solution, appropriate for different classes of equations. One of the most important is based on the notion of distributions. Avoiding the language of distributions, one starts with a differential equation and rewrites it in such a way that no derivatives of the solution of the equation show up (the new form is called the weak formulation, and the solutions to it are called weak solutions). Somewhat surprisingly, a differential equation may have solutions which are not differentiable; and the weak formulation allows one to find such solutions. Weak solutions are important because a great many differential equations encountered in modelling real-world phenomena do not admit of sufficiently smooth solutions, and the only way of solving such equations is using the weak formulation. Even in situations where an equation does have differentiable solutions, it is often convenient to first prove the existence of weak solutions and only later show that those solutions are in fact smooth enough. A concrete example As an illustration of the concept, consider the first-order wave equation: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x}=0 \\\\quad \\\\quad (1) where u = u(t, x) is a function of two real variables. To indirectly probe the properties of a possible solution u, one integrates it against an arbitrary smooth function \\\\varphi\\\\,! of compact support, known as a test function, taking \\\\textstyle\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty u(x,y)\\\\,\\\\varphi(x,t)\\\\,dx\\\\,dt. For example, if œÜ is a smooth probability distribution concentrated near a point (x,t)=(x_\\\\circ,y_\\\\circ), the integral is approximately u(x_\\\\circ,t_\\\\circ). Notice that while the integrals go from ‚àí‚àû to ‚àû, they are essentially over a finite box where \\\\varphi\\\\,! is non- zero. Thus, assume a solution u is continuously differentiable on the Euclidean space R2, multiply the equation (1) by a test function œÜ (smooth of compact support), and integrate: :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\partial u(t, x)}{\\\\partial t} \\\\varphi (t, x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} t \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} x +\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\partial u(t, x)}{\\\\partial x} \\\\varphi(t,x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}t \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} x =0. Using Fubini's theorem which allows one to interchange the order of integration, as well as integration by parts (in t for the first term and in x for the second term) this equation becomes: :-\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty u (t, x) \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\varphi (t, x)}{\\\\partial t} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} t \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} x -\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty u (t, x) \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\varphi (t, x)}{\\\\partial x} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} t \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} x =0. \\\\quad \\\\quad (2) (Boundary terms vanish since œÜ is zero outside a finite box.) We have shown that equation (1) implies equation (2) as long as u is continuously differentiable. The key to the concept of weak solution is that there exist functions u which satisfy equation (2) for any œÜ, but such u may not be differentiable and so cannot satisfy equation (1). An example is u(t, x) = t ‚àí x, as one may check by splitting the integrals over regions x ‚â• t and x ‚â§ t where u is smooth, and reversing the above computation using integration by parts. A weak solution of equation (1) means any solution u of equation (2) over all test functions œÜ. General case The general idea which follows from this example is that, when solving a differential equation in u, one can rewrite it using a test function \\\\varphi\\\\,!, such that whatever derivatives in u show up in the equation, they are \\"transferred\\" via integration by parts to \\\\varphi\\\\,!, resulting in an equation without derivatives of u. This new equation generalizes the original equation to include solutions which are not necessarily differentiable. The approach illustrated above works in great generality. Indeed, consider a linear differential operator in an open set W in Rn: :P(x, \\\\partial)u(x)=\\\\sum a_{\\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2, \\\\dots, \\\\alpha_n}(x) \\\\, \\\\partial^{\\\\alpha_1}\\\\partial^{\\\\alpha_2}\\\\cdots \\\\partial^{\\\\alpha_n} u(x), where the multi-index (Œ±1, Œ±2, ..., Œ±n) varies over some finite set in Nn and the coefficients a_{\\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2, \\\\dots, \\\\alpha_n} are smooth enough functions of x in Rn. The differential equation P(x, ‚àÇ)u(x) = 0 can, after being multiplied by a smooth test function \\\\varphi\\\\,! with compact support in W and integrated by parts, be written as :\\\\int_W u(x) Q(x, \\\\partial) \\\\varphi (x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} x=0 where the differential operator Q(x, ‚àÇ) is given by the formula :Q(x, \\\\partial)\\\\varphi (x)=\\\\sum (-1)^{ \\\\alpha } \\\\partial^{\\\\alpha_1} \\\\partial^{\\\\alpha_2} \\\\cdots \\\\partial^{\\\\alpha_n} \\\\left[a_{\\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2, \\\\dots, \\\\alpha_n}(x) \\\\varphi(x) \\\\right]. The number :(-1)^{ \\\\alpha } = (-1)^{\\\\alpha_1+\\\\alpha_2+\\\\cdots+\\\\alpha_n} shows up because one needs Œ±1 \\\\+ Œ±2 \\\\+ ... + Œ±n integrations by parts to transfer all the partial derivatives from u to \\\\varphi\\\\,! in each term of the differential equation, and each integration by parts entails a multiplication by ‚àí1\\\\. The differential operator Q(x, ‚àÇ) is the formal adjoint of P(x, ‚àÇ) (cf adjoint of an operator). In summary, if the original (strong) problem was to find a Œ±-times differentiable function u defined on the open set W such that :P(x, \\\\partial)u(x) = 0 \\\\text{ for all } x \\\\in W (a so-called strong solution), then an integrable function u would be said to be a weak solution if :\\\\int_W u(x)\\\\, Q(x, \\\\partial) \\\\varphi (x)\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} x = 0 for every smooth function \\\\varphi\\\\,! with compact support in W.  Other kinds of weak solution  The notion of weak solution based on distributions is sometimes inadequate. In the case of hyperbolic systems, the notion of weak solution based on distributions does not guarantee uniqueness, and it is necessary to supplement it with entropy conditions or some other selection criterion. In fully nonlinear PDE such as the Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation, there is a very different definition of weak solution called viscosity solution.

In 1990 GameTek released a version on the NES. GameTek later released four more Feud games for the Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis, 3DO, and PC between 1993 and 1995. Hasbro Interactive, Global Star, and Ubisoft have also released versions starting in 2000. ShareData versions ShareData released the first video game versions of the game show in 1987 on the Apple II and Commodore 64, with two versions of the packaging: one shows a drawing of a just completed round (using the Milton Bradley home game art design), and another shows a full shot of the set from the first Richard Dawson era. The game plays like the Dawson era (with the look similar to the 1976 - 1985 era) with (2 Single rounds, 1 Double Round, and 1 Triple Round - with 300 point rules and Fast Money Win of $10,000) Later in 1989, ShareData released \\"The All New Family Feud\\" on PC, Apple, C64 with rules, gameplay and look based on the Ray Combs era.http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/all-new-family-feud GameTek versions gameplay=NES In the NES version of Family Feud, the game tried to recreate the look and feel from the original Richard Dawson-hosted series, even going as far as to include a Dawson-like host who kissed the female characters in the game. (This differed from the game's packaging, which used the set from the Ray Combs era.) One or two players could play. Just like the show, the object was to come up with answers to survey questions posed to 100 people. Correct answers were worth money, with $200 winning the game and the right to play Fast Money for $5,000, which was played exactly the same way as on the show (at least 200 points needed to win). $5 a point was awarded for unsuccessful playings of the round. A player entered his answers by using the controller to scroll through the alphabet, contained in a string along the bottom of the screen; the answer had to be completed within a time limit. Reasonable similies to correct answers were accepted, and slight misspellings were also recognized. Once a player won, they were given two options. The first was to stop playing, with the other being to continue on. A champion retired after winning over $20,000 automatically unless they were defeated. If a computer-controlled family wins the game, no Fast Money is played with an excuse given to the form of \\"Due to (EXCUSE), the (NAMES) will not be playing Fast Money today\\". Excuses used include \\"tax considerations\\" and \\"a birth in the family\\". This is a carry-over from the ShareData versions of the game. SNES/Genesis and 3DO/PC The versions that followed used the Combs set, with the SNES and Genesis version using a host resembling Combs and the 3DO and PC versions featuring a host resembling Dawson (as he had returned to the series by this point). The later versions also added options to where a player could play a game without facing an opponent and whether or not they wanted to play the Bullseye Round, which had been added to the show in 1992 and was included in each of the later releases. The Bullseye Round was played as it was during the last two seasons of the Combs Feud, where a $5,000 starting bank was used and up to $15,000 could be added depending on how many questions a team answered correctly. The later version games played for points instead of dollars, with 300 winning the game. After a win, a player received a code to use if they wanted to stop playing but pick up where they left off. Five wins meant automatic retirement regardless of how much money a player won. Next Generation reviewed the 3DO version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"It's a blast if you have a bunch of folks with whom to play, however, in the final analysis, whether or not you like it probably depends on whether or not you like the television show.\\" Hasbro, Global Star, and Ubisoft versions In 2000, Family Feud was released for the PlayStation and PC by Hasbro Interactive. Louie Anderson, who was the host at the time, is the host of the game, appearing as a Full-motion video character. The game focuses on reliving the same aspect of the game show, in order to provide a better experience. The IBM PC version also features the ability to upload portraits of one's face, and placed in a three-dimensional animated body. This brought the whole experience closer, and it is often considered to be a good feature of the game. The PC version would later be released in the United Kingdom in 2001 under the show's UK name Family Fortunes. The only differences between both is that Family Feud host Louie Anderson is replaced with then-Family Fortunes host Les Dennis, and the graphics have been changed to resemble the Family Fortunes set used at the time of the game's release. In 2006, Global Star versions for the PlayStation 2, PC, and Game Boy Advance were made. Although the box art uses the 2006‚Äì2007 season's logo (the first time it was publicly seen before John O'Hurley was announced as host), the first set design in the game is the one from the 2005‚Äì2006 season (Richard Karn's final year). Other sets that can be unlocked are the original 1976‚Äì85, 1988‚Äì94, 1994‚Äì95, and 1999‚Äì2002. Well-known game show host Todd Newton does the voiceover in addition to hosting the game. In 2009, Ubisoft released Family Feud 2010 Edition for the Wii, Nintendo DS, and PC. The game uses the 2009 set and features customizable family avatars plus a predictive text input tool for faster answers. In a unique twist, the Wii version requires players to swing the Wii Remote down to hit the buzzer during Face-Offs. The game uses four-member families (much like the 1994‚Äì1995 season) as opposed to the usual five; like Ubisoft's Price Is Right video game, there is no host featured - all voiceover work is done by Terence McGovern. In 2010, Ubisoft released Family Feud Decades for the Wii. The game uses sets and survey questions from the past four decades, using the 1976, 1988, 1999, and 2009 sets. Family Feud 2012 was released in 2011 and features Steve Harvey within the game. In addition to the home games, a DVD set titled All-Star Family Feud was released on January 8, 2008 and featured a total of 15 celebrity episodes from the original ABC/syndicated versions on its four discs. It was re-issued as The Best of All-Star Family Feud on February 2, 2010.

Starfleet's USS Voyager stranded on the other side of the Galaxy, once again encounters a race of cybernetic organisms called the Borg as the ship journeys back to Earth. These two episodes were broadcast on the United Paramount Network (UPN) in the year 2000, and later released on DVD. Plot=Part I Seven of Nine dreams of a beautiful forest. However, she finds that the forest in her dream is a real subconscious realm inhabited by the minds of certain Borg drones during regeneration periods. Few drones possess the recessive gene required to experience the realm called Unimatrix Zero. In the surreal, utopian Unimatrix Zero, Borg of various species and ages (including children) from throughout the massive geography of the Collective exist as their individual, unassimilated selves and interact with one another as such. While out of regeneration, they revert to normal drones and have no memory of their time spent together there. The Borg Queen knows about Unimatrix Zero, considering it a disease, and destroys drones discovered capable of visiting it. However, the process of detecting affected drones is time consuming, and she is eager to find a faster method of finding and deactivating them. Those who are detected are deactivated, dismembered, and studied in an effort to speed up the search. Seven of Nine journeys with Captain Janeway to the subconscious realm and reverts to acting more like an individual. It turns out that she used to visit Unimatrix Zero when she was still part of the collective. Her forgotten lover Axum has made contact with her so that she may help them; the inhabitants of Unimatrix Zero have developed a masking nanovirus which would inoculate them against being detected by the queen, but it can only be administered from the corporeal world. Seven soon becomes overwhelmed and discouraged by her new-found emotions and denies them at first, although she eventually comes to terms with them. If Unimatrix Zero cannot be stopped in the real world, the Queen plans to destroy it from within. Assimilated drones attack the subconscious \\"unassimilated\\" drones constantly. As Voyager plans to help the Unimatrix-drones, the Borg Queen contacts the ship. She knows of Voyagers recent communications with the Federation and offers Janeway transwarp technology, if Voyager is accommodating and ceases helping the Unimatrix-drones. Janeway refuses. After being blackmailed by Chakotay (he promises to have the Doctor remove her from command), Captain Janeway, Tuvok and B'Elanna penetrate the Borg cube to reach the central plexus and administer the nanovirus. Voyager distracts the Cube while they infiltrate the cube but are caught. Voyager leaves them to be assimilated. Part II The Janeway, Tuvok, and Torres drones are un-connected to the Collective as the Doctor had inoculated them with a neural inhibitor, protecting their individuality. They proceed with their plan to help Unimatrix Zero. However, Tuvok's inhibitor wears off, and the Collective eventually overcomes his mind. The Borg Queen confronts Janeway, demanding that the drones of Unimatrix Zero submit themselves for reassimilation. The Queen destroys several of her own ships, each housing thousands of lives, because only a handful within are \\"offline\\" and therefore suspected of being the newly sentient drones from the dream realm. Janeway calls her bluff, pointing out that such a tactic would essentially require her to destroy the entire Collective. Having discovered a means of sending Borg as drones into Unimatrix Zero, she then threatens to release a Borg-modified form of the nanovirus from within Unimatrix Zero which would kill every affected inhabitant's corporeal drone, unless Janeway agrees to speak with them. The captain thus informs her crew that Unimatrix Zero can no longer exist. Chakotay realizes that she means destroying the matrix so the Queen can't reach the affected drones as easily, as well as cutting the Queen's only way to spread the nanovirus. The drones within are informed beforehand. Seven is forced to say goodbye to her lover, who is on a Borg ship far away in the Beta Quadrant. Meanwhile, Voyager, aided by a Borg sphere crewed by liberated drones, manages to rescue the away team. The episode ends as the independent Borg, who now, like the Queen, have the advantage of being self-aware, take command of any vessels they can, rebel, and start a civil war with the Collective. Background The Borg are a Star Trek villain species that are famous for their line \\"resistance is futile.\\" TV Guide named the Borg #4 in their 2013 list of the 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time.Bretts, Bruce; Roush, Matt; (March 25, 2013). \\"Baddies to the Bone: The 60 nastiest villains of all time\\". TV Guide. pp. 14 - 15. The Borg were introduced in 1989 in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Q Who\\" (S2E16) and went on to be a recurring narrative in many Star Trek television shows and feature films. One famous Borg-centric television episode was The Best of Both Worlds, also a two-part showing which was one of the most popular TNG episodes. The Borg become a bigger part of Voyager in 1997, during season three culminating in the two part 3-4 season cliffhanger \\"Scorpion\\" which leads to actress Jeri Ryan joining the prime cast of Voyager from then on, playing the recovering ex-Borg character Seven of Nine Releases \\"Unimatrix Zero\\" was included as part of the DVD collection, Star Trek: Fan Collective ‚Äì Borg released on March 7, 2006. Reception IGN rated the Borg Queen as the 24th best character of Star Trek overall, and her story running from the film Star Trek: First Contact and into her encounters with Captain Janeway of the USS Voyager and Seven of Nine are noted as is the events at the Unimatrix. IGN notes she was played by two different actresses, Alice Krige and Susanna Thompson. The Borg cubes are rated as the 2nd best spacecraft of Star Trek by Space.com in 2017. SyFy recommend this episode for their Seven of Nine binge-watching guide. In 2019, Nerdist suggested watching \\"Unimatrix\\" as part of an abbreviated binge- watching guide featuring USS Voyager's confrontations with the Borg. In 2020, SyFy Wire ranked \\"Unimatrix Zero\\" as one of the seven essential episodes about Borg to watch as background for Star Trek: Picard. In 2020, Space.com recommended watching this episode as background for Star Trek: Picard.

History The Mitchell Camera Corporation was founded in 1919 by Americans Henry Boeger and George Alfred Mitchell as the National Motion Picture Repair Co. Their first camera was designed and patented by John E. Leonard in 1917, and from 1920 on, was known as the Mitchell Standard Studio Camera. Features included a planetary gear-driven variable shutter (US Patent No 1,297,703) and a unique rack-over design (US Pat No 1,297,704). George Mitchell perfected and upgraded Leonard's original design, and went on to produce the most beloved and most universally used motion picture cameras of the Golden Age of Hollywood under the name of The Mitchell Camera Company. The company was first headquartered on Sunset Blvd in Los Angeles, then building a new factory in West Hollywood and moving there in 1930, and finally moving operations to their final factory location in Glendale, California in the 1940s. Mitchell Camera Corporation was privately and quietly purchased in mid 1929 by William Fox of Fox Film Studios, just before the Great Depression began, though George Mitchell continued working with the company until he retired in the 1950s. Although William Fox had lost control and possession of his own Fox Film Studios and theaters empire in March of 1930, he apparently quietly retained possession of the Mitchell Camera Company, as William Fox's two daughters still owned the Mitchell Camera Company when the company closed operations and ceased in the late 1970s. Technology Mitchell Camera also supplied camera intermittent movements for Technicolor's Three-Strip camera (1932), and such movements for others' 65mm and VistaVision conversions before later making complete 65mm and VistaVision cameras (normal and high speed). Mitchell also made a pin-registered background plate projector with a carbon arc lamphouse which was synchronized with the film camera. One of the first MPRPPs (Mitchell Pin Registered Process Projector) was used in Gone with the Wind. Two- and three-headed background projectors evolved for VistaVision effects. George Mitchell received an Academy Honorary Award in 1952. The Mitchell Camera Company received an Academy Award for Technical Achievement in 1939, 1966 and 1968. Models *1935 model Mitchell NC CameraMitchell Standard 35mm camera - The original Mitchell rackover pin-registered studio camera, introduced in 1920 as a hand-cranked silent film camera. (The rackover device allowed the camera portion with its side-mounted viewfinder to be \\"racked over\\" upon its base by turning a handle on the rear of the camera base. By racking to the right, the operator would focus the lens upon a ground glass element seen through the viewfinder. By racking back to the left, the camera with its film would be brought into position to record the view of the now focused lens. This standard model came with a 4-lens turret, a matte box on rails mounted to the front of the camera, and options included a veeder film footage counter, behind the lens iris, 4-way adjustable frame mattes, automatic or hand dissolve, internal matte disk with 9 pre-cut mattes including 1/2 frame, circles, keyhole, binocular, and oval. Various improvements and available options on this model took place over subsequent years, including a frames- per-second film speed meter, addition of a side-view parallax finder with upright view, various electric motors including variable speed, constant speed, and synchronized motors. The talking pictures introduced in 1926 soon required this somewhat noisy camera to run quieter with the so-called \\"silent\\" film movements, and soon thereafter a higher-speed \\"silent\\" movement and follow-focus devices were made available. *Mitchell FC 70mm Fox Grandeur Studio Camera - Introduced in 1929, this camera was the first successful early widescreen attempt. The original 1929 Mitchell 70mm FC studio cameras are not to be confused with the later Mitchell 65mm Model FC and BFC 1957 2nd generation studio cameras. The original Mitchell FC Fox Grandeur 70mm studio camera is an enlarged version of the late 1920s Mitchell Standard 35mm Studio Camera. The FC Fox Grandeur camera was adapted to accept 4-perf 70mm film stock. These cameras were originally developed in 1928 and ordered from Mitchell Camera Corporation by William Fox through his Fox-Case Corporation (Theodore Case, along with his assistant Earl Sponable, was the developer of the \\"MovieTone\\" sound on film system). It is unknown if the letters; \\"FC\\" model designation, originally stood for Fox-Case or for Fox Camera. After a prototype was produced by George Mitchell in 1928, the first three Mitchell 70mm FC Fox Grandeur production cameras were delivered to Fox-Case in New York in mid May 1929, then forwarded to William Fox's Fox Film Studios (camera serial numbers FC-1, FC-2, and FC-3). Camera Number FC-1 was subsequently returned to the Mitchell factory with a possible reason being that it was then removed from its studio L-Base, and made into a sync-sound audio on film recording camera, with the synced sound footage to be later synchronized to the photo recording camera's footage for editing and release prints. A total of eight or nine 70mm Fox FC Grandeur cameras had been delivered to Fox- Case/Fox Film Studios by April 1930 when \\"The Big Trail\\" began shooting. Fox Studios abandoned the 70mm Grandeur format after \\"The Big Trail\\" failed to financially perform to expectations. Four additional Mitchell FC Grandeur cameras had been delivered to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in February 1930, and one additional Mitchell FC Grandeur camera was delivered to Feature Productions in 1930. Only a few widescreen feature films had been produced in the 70mm Grandeur format, including the Fox MovieTone Follies of 1929, Happy Days, Song O' My heart, and the final spectacular $2 Million US dollar Fox Grandeur film, The Big Trail (Oct 1930), featuring 23 year old Marion Mitchell Morrison using his screen name of John Wayne for the first time, in his first starring role. MGM produced two features; their renamed \\"Realife\\" productions of Billy The Kid 1930, and The Great Meadow, released in 1931. \\"The Big Trail\\" was the final Grandeur film of Fox Studios, as the format was not used by Fox afterwards. The failure of the large studios to agree upon a widescreen format, and due mostly to the financial problems caused by the Great Depression, along with the costs of upgrading theaters to widescreen that were yet upgraded from silent to sound, spelled the end of widescreen until more than 20 years later when nearly all of the original Mitchell FC Grandeur cameras were sought out to be retooled and modified in the 1950s to become cameras such as the 65mm Todd-AO, MGM 65, Ultra Panavision 70 cameras, etc. Only two of the original Mitchell FC 70mm Fox Grandeur cameras, both from the 1929/1930 70mm Fox Grandeur widescreen attempt, are still known to exist in original and unmodified condition, ie; camera serial numbers FC-2 and FC-8, as these two cameras somehow ended up in the military in the 1940s. Later versions of this 70mm camera were also supplied to the US Military in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. *Mitchell GC - Introduced for the military in 1940, and based on the Standard 35mm Studio model, but without the studio special effects options, the GC is a High-speed camera system, able to run at variable speeds up to 128 frames per second. *Mitchell NC/BNC (\\"Newsreel Camera\\"/\\"Blimped Newsreel Camera\\") - Improved model designed to run quietly for production sound-shooting, introduced in 1932. This camera became the de facto standard for Hollywood Production for the greater part of the 20th century. Mitchell NC and BNC camera heads became \\"donors\\" for Cinema Products Corporation XR35 cameras, which incorporated many of CP's improvements to the basic Mitchell production sound camera, and which were formerly available as separate features from Cineam Products Corp. Three Mitchell BNC cameras were employed by Desilu Productions in the groundbreaking multiple-camera setup used to film its CBS-TV situation comedy I Love Lucy. *Mitchell SS - Single- system camera - Used mainly by the U.S. Army Signal Corps units during WW-II; was a highly modified NC which included an RCA optical sound recording galvanometer and a \\"sound translation point\\" which was separate from the camera's main film drive sprocket. *Mitchell VistaVision camera - Production camera for sound shooting using Paramount's VistaVision process (The Ten Commandments, 1956 and later; (earlier VistaVision productions used converted Stein and/or converted Technicolor Three-Strip cameras). VistaVision was used by George Lucas in Star Wars for its larger negative while avoiding costly 65mm special-effects shots. *2nd Generation Mitchell 65mm FC/BFC (\\"Fox Camera\\"/\\"Blimped Fox Camera\\") - Not to be confused with the original 1929 1st generation Mitchell FC Fox 70mm Grandeur cameras, this is an updated 65mm version of the original Fox Grandeur FC, with improvements adapted from the 35mm NC and BNC. It was introduced with the improved Todd-AO system (South Pacific, 1957, and later). *Mitchell R35 camera - a pin-registered, hand- holdable and tripod-mountable reflex 35mm camera with multiple magazine mounting positions and an available sound blimp. Proprietary R35 lens mount. Succeeded by the R35R (industry-standard BNCR mount) and the R35RC (BNCR mount and crystal-controlled motor). *Mitchell NCR/BNCR camera - Reflex version of NC/BNC *Mitchell 16 camera - a pin-registered 16mm camera with the versatility of the Standard, and the high speed of the GC *Mitchell R16 camera - a pin- registered reflex 16mm camera which was relatively silent and was available in double-system (Model R16DS) and single-system (Model R16SS) models for newsgathering and newsfilm production. This relatively expensive model found use mainly with CBS's 60 Minutes. The single-system model incorporated a Davis (tight) Loop drive system, unique in all single-system production cameras. The double-system model simply eliminated the Davis (tight) Loop drive system, and the lower sprocket, thereby reducing the complexity of the internal gearing and lowering the camera's acoustic noise signature. *Mitchell Tripod - Wood base tripod introduced about 1920, this tripod was manufactured and sold by Mitchell until the 1970s with very little change, other than the addition of a \\"Baby\\" shorter version introduced in 1928. *Mitchell Hand Cranked Pan/Tilt Head - Introduced with the above wood tripod about 1920, and known through the 1920s as the Mitchell Standard Tripod Head. *Mitchell Friction Pan/Tilt Head - By August of 1920, George Mitchell had invented the Friction Head, and filed for patent by 1921. Taking time to perfect it, the well known Friction Pan/Tilt Head was introduced in 1928. The Friction Head very quickly became the standard professional motion picture camera pan/tilt tripod head, replacing earlier hand-cranked types. *Mitchell Panoramic Friction-Tilt Stills Camera Head and Tripod - Sometime during the 1920s, apparently between 1921 and 1928, George Mitchell also created and marketed a lightweight 2-stage tripod with a tilting head that was especially created for the cinema photo- stills photographers. The camera support head featured a multiple plate friction controlled 90 degree tilt mechanism, sight levels on both the base platform and the tilt platform of the head, and featured enclosed and under- glass 360 degree graduated panoramic charts for both the base and the tilt platforms. The bottom stage legs of the adjustable height tripod are reversible, allowing for a choice of either rubber feet or ground spikes. Licensed Derivatives Certain early models were licensed to Newall in the U.K. Unlicensed Derivatives Certain models were copied in whole or in part by the U.S.S.R., mostly models which were intended for filming animation or special effects process plates, or for high-speed filming. In a few cases, the U.S.S.R. added spinning mirror-shutter reflex focusing and viewing, thereby deleting the Mitchell-designed rackover focusing mechanism and the Mitchell-designed side viewer. Though the Eastern Bloc standard for camera film is Kodak Standard perforations, that standard was rejected by the very Bloc which proposed it. U.S.S.R. professional cameras consequently require film stocks that are incompatible with Western Bloc camera film, which always uses Bell & Howell perforations. Eastern Bloc (KS) camera film will pass undamaged through a Western Bloc (BH) professional camera, but the images will not be registered accurately. Conversely, Western Bloc (BH) camera film will not pass undamaged through a U.S.S.R. professional camera (KS), as the perforations used for registration will be damaged. 16mm and 65/70mm films were standardized late in the standardization cycle so these U.S.S.R. cameras in these gauges are indeed compatible with Western Bloc camera films. Legacy Production (sound) models in 16mm, 35mm (4- and 2-perf) and 65mm (5-perf) served as a basis for early Panavision cameras in those gauges. Literature * Ira B.

She joined DC Comics in 1976 as publisher, and five years later was promoted to president. In 1989, she stepped down as publisher and assumed the title of editor-in-chief while retaining the office of president. After 26 years with DC, she left the company in 2002. Early life Jenette Kahn grew up in Boston. Her father was a rabbi. Her brother, Si Kahn, is a singer- songwriter and activist. She was an avid comics fan, a practice supported by her parents, with particular favorites being Batman, Superman, Little Lulu, Uncle Scrooge, and Archie. Career After graduating from Radcliffe College with a degree in art history, Kahn eventually founded three magazines for young people. The original publication, Kids, was entirely written by children for one another. Its subject matter included drug abuse, diversity, animal protection, and the environment. Kahn's second magazine was Dynamite, for Scholastic Inc.. Kahn followed with Smash for Xerox Education Publications.  DC Comics  Kahn was 28 years old on February 2, 1976, when she became publisher of DC Comics, a division of Warner Bros. and home to over five thousand characters, including Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. Sol Harrison served as the company's president. Kahn stated in a 2012 interview that \\"I can't really say that Sol and I had much of a working relationship. He, more than anybody, resented my being hired because he felt that the job [of publisher] was rightfully his.\\" In February 1981, she became president following the retirement of Harrison.Levitz (2010) p. 455 She was the youngest person in the company to become president of a division, and the first woman. Furthermore, before Kahn began her new position, she was instrumental in dissuading the head of Warner Publishing from simply ending National's publishing in favor of simple license maintenance, and kept it a going concern. To mark her new direction for the company, Kahn officially renamed National Periodical Publications to DC Comics, complete with a bold new company logo, nicknamed the DC Bullet, designed by Milton Glaser. Furthermore, she moved to centralize editorial from its individual fiefdoms to place the characters in a more interactive DC Multiverse with a more systematic approval process for the artistic staff to produce fewer and commercially sounder titles. To that end, Kahn sought to hire young staff to revitalize the content such as an unsuccessful attempt to Marvel Comics mainstay artist, John Buscema, and a successful recruitment of major Marvel writer, Steve Englehart. Later in her administration, Kahn's recruitment goals became easier for the fact that Marvel Comics' Editor-in-Chief, Jim Shooter, was proving alienating to much of his company's creative staff and they consequently proved receptive to Kahn's offers including major talents like Roy Thomas, Gene Colan, Marv Wolfman, and George Perez. Kahn initiated the \\"DC Explosion\\" of new titles and formats which was followed in 1978 by a company downturn referred to as the \\"DC Implosion. Along with editor and executive vice president Paul Levitz and managing editor Dick Giordano, Kahn then revitalized the company through the remainder of the decade and the 1980s, including the introduction of \\"Dollar Comics\\" publications, as well as limited series to allow for more flexible arrangements for the talent. Kahn supported creators' rights in an industry in which royalties and other traditional publishing rights were not the norm, thus giving the talent a stake in the commercial success of their work that the industry's traditional work-for-hire arrangements never encouraged. In 1989, she assumed the title of editor-in-chief while retaining the office of president but stepped down as publisher.Levitz (2010) p. 567 Kahn oversaw the launch in 1993 of the Vertigo imprint and of Milestone Media, a minority- founded and ethnically diverse line of comic books that DC published for several years and from which Static Shock, the animated show on The WB television network, was developed. Kahn is credited with overseeing a successful period of reinvention for DC's classic characters, including the death and rebirth of Superman. Giordano commented that Kahn had no editorial restrictions on creators, as far as he could tell. Under Kahn's leadership, DC became known for pushing boundaries in subject matter by addressing issues of domestic violence, sexual orientation, gun violence, homelessness, racism, and AIDS in the company's mainstream titles. One exception to this editorial stance was Kahn cancelling an issue of Swamp Thing where the title character interacts with Jesus, which led to the writer and artist Rick Veitch quitting, citing censorship concerns. She oversaw a diversification of the originally overwhelmingly male staff at DC, to the point where when she left, almost half the employees were women. Kahn left DC Comics in 2002 after 26 years with the company to pursue a career as a film producer.Levitz (2010) p. 638  Double Nickel Entertainment  Kahn is a partner in Double Nickel Entertainment, a film production company she co-founded with Adam Richman after leaving DC Comics. Double Nickel's first film was The Flock (2007) starring Richard Gere and Claire Danes and directed by Andrew Lau. Its second was Gran Torino (2008), starring Clint Eastwood, who also directed. In addition, Kahn serves on the boards of Exit Art and Harlem Stage, and is an advisor to The Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company. She is a founding member of The Committee of 200, a nationwide forum of key women in business. Her first book, In Your Space, was published by Abbeville Press in 2002. Awards Kahn received the Library of Congress Living Legends award in the \\"Writers and Artists\\" category in April 2000 for her significant contributions to America's cultural heritage. She received an Inkpot Award in July 2010. President Ronald Reagan honored Kahn for her work on drug awareness, and she has been honored by the Clinton Administration, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the United Nations, and the Department of Defense for her work on land mines. The FBI honored Kahn for her efforts on gun control, as did former Governor Douglas Wilder of Virginia, who credited her with helping to pass stricter gun control legislation in his state. She was honored by the World Design Foundation for outstanding creative achievements. Kahn created The Wonder Woman Foundation in honor of Wonder Woman's 40th Anniversary. In its three years of existence, the foundation contributed more than $350,000 in grants to women over 40 in various categories.

Soares lost the use of his legs after contracting childhood polio at the age of nine. He used crutches until he was in high school, when he switched to a wheelchair because he says it gave him greater mobility and he said the girls liked it.Quote from Murderball Soares began playing rugby in 1969 and, as of 2005, was the only player to have participated in 13 consecutive United States National Championships. He was a member of the U.S. wheelchair rugby team that won the gold medal at the 1996 Summer Paralympics in Atlanta, Georgia. He was also a finalist in singles and a champion in doubles at the 1996 U.S. Open for wheelchair tennis in the Quad \\"A\\" Division. Soares was cut from the U.S. team in 1996 and lost a lawsuit in an attempt to make a point soon after. Soares then applied to coach the United States team, but was rejected. Due to wishing to continue with rugby Soares went on to coach the Canadian wheelchair rugby team, leading them to victory against the until then-undefeated United States team in Gothenburg, Sweden. Soares was fired by the Canadian wheelchair rugby team in 2005, and moved on to coach the British team. Soares was released by the Great Britain Team in June 2008. In 2010 Soares began coaching the German national team. During his work for them, he failed to improve the German's IWRF World Ranking, instead they dropped at the 2010 World Wheelchair Rugby Championships from 7th to 10th place.

History The United Office Building was designed by architect James A. Johnson of Esenwein & Johnson, one of the most successful architectural firms in Buffalo at the time. It was built by Frank A. Dudley, president of the United Hotels Company of America (later United Hotels of America), and completed in 1929 on the eve of the Great Depression. The building is one of the most important landmarks in downtown Niagara Falls. It is constructed of steel and brick with a terra-cotta facade. The building's Mayan Revival art deco elements of sculpture and pressed terra-cotta brick draw inspiration from the iconography of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures. Note: This includes and Accompanying six photographs The upper five stories of the building include two floors of approximately 3,000 square feet and three top floors of approximately 1,000 square feet each, which were constructed to house mechanical and elevator equipment. The United Office Building, at 20 stories, was the tallest building in Niagara Falls until 2005, when it was surpassed in height by the nearby Seneca Niagara Casino and Hotel. The top floors have views of the American and Horseshoe Falls of Niagara Falls. Renovation The building was abandoned in the 1980s and was vacant for over 15 years. In 2004, the USA Niagara Development Corporation, a subsidiary to the State's Economic Development Agency, purchased the building for one dollar. Carl Paladino's Ellicott Development Co. undertook extensive renovations of the building, totaling $10 million (). In 2010, after the renovation, the building was renamed The Giacomo Hotel and Residences, and now houses 27 apartments, office space, and a 38-room hotel, the Giacomo. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.

Intending to loosely represent the 1988-89 season of the National Football League, the game uses the teams and play formations of that particular era while avoiding usage of the players' names, due to a lack of an NFLPA license, which was given to Tecmo's Tecmo Bowl. The player could play one of four options, either Interconference, AFC and NFC game or the Super Bowl (specifically Super Bowl XXIII). Along with the option to choose a package to play during the game, players can directly control the entire team at once. This game was one of the first NFL video games on a gaming system. The game employs a Top-Down system for the actual gameplay and allows players to assign handicaps to a human opponent that is not equally skilled as they are.

Early life Browne was born Joy Oppenheim in New Orleans, Louisiana, the oldest of five children born to Nelson Oppenheim, a life insurance salesman, and Ruth Strauss, a teacher. Browne spent much of her childhood in Denver, Colorado and graduated from Rice University in Houston, Texas with a bachelor's degree in behavioral science. Career Browne did her graduate work at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, earning an M.A. and Ph.D. in psychology. She was a licensed clinical psychologist who was first on the air in Boston at WITS, where she hosted a program called Up Close and Personal in the late 1970s. She later hosted call-in shows on radio stations in San Francisco and New York City. Her syndicated show was one of the longest-running call-in therapy shows in the United States. Browne took a no-nonsense approach to callers, trying to zero in on a problem without getting caught up in a caller's long stories or digressions. Browne was also known for her \\"one-year rule\\", which states that people who have lost a spouse or long-time partner due to break-up, death, or divorce should wait at a minimum one year before resuming romantic relationships.

In perceiving a sequence of consecutive stimuli, subjects tend to overestimate the elapsed time between two successive stimuli when the distance between the stimuli is sufficiently large, and to underestimate the elapsed time when the distance is sufficiently small. In different sensory modalities The kappa effect can occur with visual (e.g., flashes of light), auditory (e.g., tones), or tactile (e.g. taps to the skin) stimuli. Many studies of the kappa effect have been conducted using visual stimuli. For example, suppose three light sources, X, Y, and Z, are flashed successively in the dark with equal time intervals between each of the flashes. If the light sources are placed at different positions, with X and Y closer together than Y and Z, the temporal interval between the X and Y flashes is perceived to be shorter than that between the Y and Z flashes.TAU- AND KAPPA-EFFECTS. Elsevier's Dictionary of Psychological Theories. Oxford: Elsevier Science & Technology, 2006. Credo Reference. 29 May 2008 The kappa effect has also been demonstrated with auditory stimuli that move in frequency. However, in some experimental paradigms the auditory kappa effect has not been observed. For example, Roy et al. (2011) found that, opposite to the prediction of the kappa effect, \\"Increasing the distance between sound sources marking time intervals leads to a decrease of the perceived duration\\".Roy, M., Kuroda, T., & Grondin, S. (2011). Effect of space on auditory temporal processing with a single-stimulus method. Advances in Sound Localization, 95-104 In touch, the kappa effect was first described as the \\"S-effect\\" by Suto (1952). Goldreich (2007) refers to the kappa effect as \\"perceptual time dilation\\" in analogy with the physical time dilation of the theory of relativity. Theories based in velocity expectation Physically, traversed space and elapsed time are linked by velocity. Accordingly, several theories regarding the brain's expectations about stimulus velocity have been put forward to account for the kappa effect. Constant velocity expectation According to the constant velocity hypothesis proposed by Jones and Huang (1982), the brain incorporates a prior expectation of speed when judging spatiotemporal intervals. Specifically, the brain expects temporal intervals that would produce constant velocity (i.e., uniform motion) movement. Thus, the kappa effect occurs when we apply our knowledge of motion to stimulus sequences, which sometimes leads us to make mistakes.Dr. Molly J. Henry, Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences; Leipzig, Germany Evidence for the role of a uniform motion expectation in temporal perception comes from a study in which participants observed eight white dots that successively appeared in one direction in a horizontal alignment along a straight line. When the temporal separation was constant and the spatial separation between the dots varied, they observed the kappa effect, which follows the constant velocity hypothesis. However, when both the temporal and spatial separation between the dots varied, they failed to observe the response pattern that the constant velocity hypothesis predicts. A possible explanation is that it is difficult to perceive a uniform motion from such varying, complicated patterns; thus, the context of observed events may affect our temporal perception. Low-speed expectation A Bayesian perceptual model replicates the tactile kappa effect and other tactile spatiotemporal illusions, including the tau effect and the cutaneous rabbit illusion. According to this model, brain circuitry encodes the expectation that tactile stimuli tend to move slowly. The Bayesian model reaches an optimal probabilistic inference by combining uncertain spatial and temporal sensory information with a prior expectation for low-speed movement. The expectation that stimuli tend to move slowly results in the perceptual overestimation of the time elapsed between rapidly successive taps applied to separate skin locations. Simultaneously, the model perceptually underestimates the spatial separation between stimuli, thereby reproducing the cutaneous rabbit illusion and the tau effect. Goldreich (2007) speculated that a Bayesian slow-speed prior might explain the visual kappa effect as well the tactile one. Recent empirical studies support this suggestion. Motion in different contexts The kappa effect appears to depend strongly on phenomenal rather than physical extent. The kappa effect gets bigger as stimuli move faster. Observers tend to apply their previous knowledge of motion to a sequence of stimuli. When subjects observed vertically arranged stimuli, the kappa effect was stronger for sequences moving downward. This can be attributed to the expectation of downward acceleration and upward deceleration, in that the perceived accelerated downward motion causes us to underestimate temporal separation judgments. Related illusions If observers interpret rapid stimulus sequences in light of an expectation regarding velocity, then it would be expected that not only temporal, but also spatial illusions would result. This indeed occurs in the tau effect, when the spatial separation between stimuli is constant and the temporal separation is varied. In this case, the observer decreases the judgment of spatial separation as temporal separation decreases, and vice versa. For example, when equally spaced light sources X, Y, and Z are flashed successively in the dark with a shorter time between X and Y than between Y and Z, X and Y are perceived to be closer together in space than are Y and Z. Goldreich (2007) linked the tau and kappa effects to the same underlying expectation regarding movement speed. He noted that, when stimuli move rapidly across space, \\"perception strikingly shrinks the intervening distance, and expands the elapsed time, between consecutive events\\". Goldreich (2007) termed these two fundamental perceptual distortions \\"perceptual length contraction\\" (tau effect) and \\"perceptual time dilation\\" (kappa effect) in analogy with the physical length contraction and time dilation of the theory of relativity. Perceptual length contraction and perceptual time dilation result from the same Bayesian observer model, one that expects stimuli to move slowly. Analogously, in the theory of relativity, length contraction and time dilation both occur when a physical speed (the speed of light) cannot be exceeded.

The Gatekeeper is a trilogy of books written by Christopher Golden and Nancy Holder based on the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Volume 1: Out of the Madhouse=Plot summary While Giles is in Manhattan for a librarian's meeting, the Scooby Gang finds that Sunnydale is suddenly overrun by demons. Meanwhile, Giles' hotel room in Manhattan is ransacked and he gets assaulted, which leads to him ending up in the hospital. Michaela Tomasi, a fellow Watcher, tries to warn him of something but disappears. Eventually Giles makes it back to Sunnydale. There they discover that portals from another realm are opening in Sunnydale which caused the drastic increase in the demon population. Giles figures that there must be something wrong at the Gatehouse, a huge mansion that is infested with demons but kept under control by Jean-Marc Regnier, a wizened sorcerer called the Gatekeeper. Giles, Buffy, Xander and Cordelia fly to Boston where the Gatehouse is located, while Willow, Oz and Angel remain in Sunnydale to ward off demons and the Sons of Entropy that seem to be stalking the Slayer. After Angel captures two Sons of Entropy, he learns, by beating them, that their boss, Giacomo Fulcanelli, also known as Il Maestro, is planning on opening the gates to other dimensions to let the demons run loose on the earth with the sons of Entropy as their kings and their immediate plan is to take over the Gatehouse in order to do this. Oz takes off to Boston to warn Buffy of the Sons of Entropy. Meanwhile, in the Gatehouse the gang is fighting off hordes of demons and they somehow manage to survive. Xander locates the Gatekeepers who manages to regain control of the Gatehouse by securing the demons in their rooms with his magic. The Gatekeeper is frail and on the verge of death, only by immersing himself in the Cauldron of Bran the Blessed, can he continue to live past his 138 years. To keep the Gatehouse in order they must find his son who is somewhere in Europe. They decide to take the ghost roads, which is a realm Ghosts wander endlessly if they cannot move on. These ghosts only allow those touched by the supernatural to pass, even though grudgingly. They envy the living. Oz takes the ghost road back to Sunnydale to get Angel, when they make it back to the mansion they discover that it's under attack. The spell fuelled by her friends and Angel's love must work its magic with the Gatekeeper's help in order to save Buffy's life Continuity *Supposed to be set late in Buffy season 3. Volume 2: Ghost Roads=Plot summary In search of Jacques Regnier, the Gatekeeper's son, Buffy, Angel and Oz take off to London via the ghost roads while the rest of the gang returns to Sunnydale. The trio in England run into every possible problem; another fake Watcher leads them into a trap and the Sons of Entropy are hot on their heels. Back in Sunnydale the ghost ship the Flying Dutchman has arrived and are taking human prisoners aboard, including Giles. Meanwhile, Il Maestro pleads to his lord Belphegor to spare Micaela, his adopted daughter, from the pain and suffering humans will have to deal with when the evil breaks loose. Spike and Drusilla are busy keeping Jacques Regnier hidden until the Sons of Entropy give them what they want. Angel learns that Il Maestro is in Florence and the trio sets off for it. Buffy's mom is kidnapped by the Sons of Entropy and they plan to use Joyce as bait to bring the Slayer to them. Back in Sunnydale Willow, Xander and Cordelia must figure out how to save Giles from the Flying Dutchman or he will be brought into hell when the boat leaves Sunnydale and no one makes it in to hell without dying first. In Boston the Gatehouse has become under attack again and though the Gatekeeper is weak he can still fend off the Sons of Entropy. Buffy, Angel and Oz infiltrate the Sons of Entropy base in Florence and are then captured by Il Maestro's men. There they learn that Il Mastero is an ancient sorcerer named Fulcaneli who was believed killed a long time ago. They manage to escape with the help of Micaela who realizes that what her father is doing is very wrong.

Jacques, the new heir, escapes from Fulcanelli and joins Buffy's entourage. Oz and Angel lead Jacques through the Ghost Roads and back to the Gatekeeper's house where an assault is being conducted on Xander and his abilities. Further complicating things is Oz, who has become a werewolf at the most inopportune moment. But Jacques arrives and his powers are restored to him.

Some fans consider them stories from the imaginations of authors and artists, while other fans consider them as taking place in an alternative fictional reality. However unlike fan fiction, overviews summarising their story, written early in the writing process, were 'approved' by both Fox and Joss Whedon (or his office), and the books were therefore later published as officially Buffy merchandise.

When the distance from one stimulus to the next is constant, and the time elapsed from one stimulus to the next is also constant, subjects tend to judge the distances, correctly, as equal. However, if the distance from one stimulus to the next is constant, but the time elapsed from one stimulus to the next is not constant, then subjects tend to misperceive the interval that has the shorter temporal interval as also having a shorter spatial interval. Thus, the tau effect reveals that stimulus timing affects the perception of stimulus spacing. Time is also a perceived quantity and subject to its own illusions; research indicates that in the tau effect, perceived stimulus spacing follows perceived (phenomenal) time rather than actual (physical) time. In different sensory modalities The tau effect can occur with visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli. In touch, the tau effect was first described by Gelb (1914). It was later given its name by Helson (1930) and characterized in detail by Helson and King (1931). In addition to the unimodal (i.e., purely visual, auditory, or tactile) tau effect, crossmodal tau effects can occur. For instance, Kawabe et al. (2008) showed that the time intervals between auditory tones could affect subjects' perceptual judgements of the spatial interval between visual flashes in a manner consistent with that predicted by the tau effect. Theories based in velocity expectation Physically, traversed space and elapsed time are linked by velocity. It is logical, then, to consider that the tau effect occurs as a consequence of the brain's assumption regarding stimulus velocity. Indeed, different theories regarding the brain's expectations about stimulus velocity have been put forward in an effort to explain the tau effect. Constant velocity hypothesis According to the constant velocity hypothesis proposed by Jones and Huang (1982), perception incorporates a prior expectation for constant speed. Therefore, given the temporal intervals marked by sequential stimuli, the brain expects spatial intervals that would yield constant velocity movement (i.e., uniform motion). One limitation of this theory, pointed out by Goldreich (2007), is that it does not explain why even two stimuli pressed in rapid succession against the skin are perceived as closer together the shorter the temporal interval between them is. In the absence of a third stimulus that creates a second spatial and temporal interval, the constant velocity hypothesis can have no bearing on this two-stimulus situation. Low-speed expectation According to a tactile Bayesian perceptual model put forward by Goldreich (2007), the brain expects that tactile stimuli tend to move slowly. The Bayesian model reaches an optimal probabilistic inference by combining uncertain spatial and temporal sensory information with a prior expectation for low-speeds. The expectation that stimuli tend to move slowly results in the perceptual underestimation of the spatial separation between rapidly consecutive stimuli (\\"perceptual length contraction\\"), thereby reproducing the tau effect and related illusions. Unlike the constant velocity hypothesis, the Bayesian model replicates the underestimation in perceived distance that occurs even when only two stimuli are presented in rapid succession. For the case of two taps to the skin, the Bayesian model perceives the length between taps, l*, to be a function of the actual length, l, and the elapsed time, t: The parameter tau (œÑ) is proportional to the observer's spatial uncertainty (specifically, it is the spatial standard deviation divided by the low-speed prior standard deviation). Consistent with this model, Tong et al. (2016) showed that stimulus pairs consisting of weaker taps, which are localized with greater uncertainty than stronger taps, result in more pronounced length contraction. Modeling the tau effect that occurs in the perception of 3-tap sequences, Goldreich and Tong (2013) compared the Bayesian model with a low-speed expectation to a Bayesian model with a low-acceleration expectation ‚Äî similar to the constant-velocity hypothesis. They found that the low-speed prior model provided better fits to the human tactile tau effect data. When time is inaccurately perceived (i.e., because of the kappa effect), the Bayesian observer model judges stimulus spacing to follow perceived time rather than actual time, consistent with reports from human subjects. Related illusions A spatial perceptual illusion that seems to be closely related to the tau effect is the rabbit illusion. In the tactile rabbit illusion, a rapid sequence of taps delivered first near the wrist and then near the elbow creates the sensation of sequential taps hopping up the arm from the wrist towards the elbow, although no physical stimulus was applied between the two actual stimulus locations. Like the tau effect, the rabbit illusion has been observed not just in touch, but also in audition and vision. If observers interpret rapid stimulus sequences in light of an expectation regarding velocity, then it would be expected that not only spatial, but also temporal illusions would result. This indeed occurs in the kappa effect: When the temporal separation between stimuli is constant and the spatial separation is varied, the observer's temporal interval judgment is influenced by the spatial distance between consecutive stimuli. Specifically, longer spatial intervals are perceived to occupy longer temporal intervals. The kappa effect is therefore the temporal perceptual analog of the tau effect. Goldreich (2007) linked the tau, rabbit, and kappa effects to the same underlying expectation regarding movement speed. He noted that, when stimuli move rapidly across space, \\"perception strikingly shrinks the intervening distance, and expands the elapsed time, between consecutive events\\". Goldreich (2007) termed these two fundamental perceptual distortions \\"perceptual length contraction\\" (tau effect, rabbit illusion) and \\"perceptual time dilation\\" (kappa effect) in analogy with the physical length contraction and time dilation of the theory of relativity. Perceptual length contraction and perceptual time dilation result from the same Bayesian observer model, one that expects stimuli to move slowly. Analogously, in the theory of relativity, length contraction and time dilation both occur when a physical speed (the speed of light) cannot be exceeded.

Phasing out began in 2003, when the Australian National Heritage List and the Commonwealth Heritage List were created and by 2007 the Register had been replaced by these and various state and territory heritage registers. Places listed on the Register remain in a non-statutory archive and are still able to be viewed via the National Heritage Database. History The register was initially compiled between 1976 and 2003 by the Australian Heritage Commission,The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, pp. 9‚Äì13 after which the register was maintained by the Australian Heritage Council. 13,000 places were listed. The expression \\"national estate\\" was first used by the British architect Clough Williams-Ellis, and reached Australia in the 1970s.Heritage of Australia, pp. 9‚Äì13 It was incorporated into the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 and was used to describe a collection of buildings and sites that were worthy of preservation for a variety of reasons. It covered natural environments as well as European history and Aboriginal culture. Process of listing Anyone could suggest that a certain site should be listed on the Register of the National Estate. A nomination form was provided and was then submitted to an expert group for evaluation. If a place was accepted for listing, the nomination was declared in the Commonwealth Gazette and newspapers. The Heritage Council eventually made a decision after the public has had time to comment and raise possible objections. The listing, if it took place, was based on an assessment of the values of the nominated place, whether \\"aesthetic, historic, scientific, or social significance, or other special value\\". A listing on the Register required that a Commonwealth Minister or authority should not take any course of action that would adversely affect the listed subjects unless there was no alternative; in the latter case, the Minister was obliged to take steps to minimise any effect on the listed subject. The listing did not impose any legal obligations on private owners, companies, State governments or local governments. The Australian Heritage Council had to be consulted if any government wanted to take a course of action that might have an adverse effect on a listed subject. The Council itself could not make decisions on a proposed course of action; such decisions were made by the Federal Minister or the relevant authority contemplating the course of action.  Criteria  Evaluation of nominated places was based on the following criteria:  Criterion A: Its importance in the course, or pattern, of Australia's natural or cultural history  A.1 Importance in the evolution of Australian flora, fauna, landscapes or climate. A.2 Importance in maintaining existing processes or natural systems at the regional or national scale. A.3 Importance in exhibiting unusual richness or diversity of flora, fauna, landscapes or cultural features. A.4 Importance for association with events, developments or cultural phases which have had a significant role in the human occupation and evolution of the nation, State, region or community.  Criterion B: Its possession of uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of Australia's natural or cultural history  B.1 Importance for rare, endangered or uncommon flora, fauna, communities, ecosystems, natural landscapes or phenomena, or as a wilderness. B.2 Importance in demonstrating a distinctive way of life, custom, process, land- use, function or design no longer practised, in danger of being lost, or of exceptional interest  Criterion C: Its potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Australia's natural or cultural history  C.1 Importance for information contributing to a wider understanding of Australian natural history, by virtue of its use as a research site, teaching site, type locality, reference or benchmark site. C.2 Importance for information contributing to a wider understanding of the history of human occupation of Australia.  Criterion D: Its importance in demonstrating the principal characteristics of: (i) a class of Australia's natural or cultural places; or (ii) a class of Australia's natural or cultural environments  D.1 Importance in demonstrating the principal characteristics of the range of landscapes, environments or ecosystems, the attributes of which identify them as being characteristic of their class. D.2 Importance in demonstrating the principal characteristics of the range of human activities in the Australian environment (including way of life, philosophy, custom, process, land use, function, design or technique).  Criterion E: Its importance in exhibiting particular aesthetic characteristics valued by a community or cultural group  E.1 Importance for a community for aesthetic characteristics held in high esteem or otherwise valued by the community.  Criterion F: Its importance in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period  F.1 Importance for its technical, creative, design or artistic excellence, innovation or achievement.  Criterion G: Its strong or special associations with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons  G.1 Importance as a place highly valued by a community for reasons of religious, spiritual, symbolic, cultural, educational, or social associations.  Criterion H: Its special association with the life or works of a person, or group of persons, of importance in Australia's natural or cultural history  H.1 Importance for close associations with individuals whose activities have been significant within the history of the nation, State or region. End of the register The Register of the National Estate was frozen in February 2007. In 2003 the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975, which had established the RNE, was repealed. In its place the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) and the Australian Heritage Council Act 2003 provided for a new system of heritage protection for nationally significant places. In 2006 the EPBC Act and the Australian Heritage Council Act 2003 were amended to freeze the RNE, and to allow five years to phase out statutory references to the RNE. As a result of these changes: *On 1 January 2004, the Australian Heritage Council took over responsibility for the RNE from the former Australian Heritage Commission. *On 19 February 2007, the database was frozen; no more additions or removals of places were allowed. *On 19 February 2012, all references to the RNE were removed from the legislation. In February 2012, the Register was replaced by the Australian National Heritage List for places of outstanding heritage value for Australia and the Commonwealth Heritage List for heritage places that are owned or controlled by the Commonwealth of Australia, together with a collection of state and territory heritage registers that most were in existence for many years. The RNE is maintained on a non-statutory basis as a publicly available archive and educational resource.

Summary Snoopy and his brother Spike facing off against each in the sack race event. This video game is a collection of six events that uses various characters from the Peanuts series (Donald Duck in the Japanese version) as opponents. Events include boot throwing (similar to hammer throwing), pizza balancing, and sack racing, among others. In the background, landmarks unique to Italy are shown (i.e., Leaning Tower of Pisa) and the structures using Roman architecture (i.e., the Colosseum) are shown while the player competes at the six events. Playing the \\"River Jump\\" event requires impeccable timing; like in the long jump event in the Track & Field video game Dewey (in the Donald Duck version), always pushes the lagging player ahead of the leader, allowing him to catch up. A majority of the game seems to be ported from the Commodore 64 video game Alternative World Games by Gremlin Interactive. The graphics in the game tend to flicker while the color palette can be weird for certain events in the game. For example, the Japanese version had Donald Duck developing green skin or his trademark blue hat suddenly becoming black. Development Snoopy's Silly Sports Spectacular is a loose port of Alternative World Games, a 1987 title for the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum. Kemco had signed a deal with British developer/publisher Gremlin Graphics for the console rights to several of their computer games (such as Monty on the Run). However, this was the only title of theirs to be re-released back to the West. Two songs in the game were previously used in the Japanese Famicom version of Spy vs. Spy II: The Island Caper, the most notable being the menu theme. Licensing After the release of the Family Computer Disk System title, Roger Rabbit, Kemco still had the rights to release Disney-based video games in Japan, while the Who Framed Roger Rabbit licensed expired, making them choose Donald Duck and release a video game starring him in Japan.Donald Duck at Hardcore Gaming 101 As Japanese video game company Capcom USA held the Disney license in North America, Kemco decided to license Snoopy instead for the North American version.

Covering , the site has a gross floor area of , approximately the size of the Canary Wharf development in London. As of 2011, the site contained some of the tallest buildings in Hong Kong ‚Äî including the tallest commercial building in Hong Kong, the 118-story International Commerce Centre and the loftiest residential tower in Hong Kong, The Cullinan ( high).  Location and accommodation  Union Square is located at 1 Austin Road West, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong. It occupies part of the 340 hectares of land reclaimed from Victoria Harbour in the 1990s to construct a highway and rail link to the new Hong Kong International Airport, and it integrates the Kowloon Station of the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway. The built area includes 5,866 residential units (totalling ), 2,230 hotel rooms, and 2,490 serviced apartments with of combined hotel and serviced apartment space and of office space. This development has a shopping mall, Elements. The name Union Square is not well known and is seldom used, and as such, people tend to refer to its constituent parts, such as the Elements mall, the ICC, the W Hotel and the various luxurious private apartment complexes. Planning and concept The contract to build and operate the airport railway was awarded to MTR Corporation in 1992. The master plan for Union Square, comprising the massive air rights development surrounding Kowloon Station, was laid out by TFP Farrells. The architects envisioned a three-dimensional mixed-use urban quarter, with numerous towers sitting atop a massive podium. According to Sir Terry Farrell, MTR Corporation initially wanted a dispersed train station with discreet entrances, but he argued for a grand station hall concept with layered space oriented around Kowloon Station providing a central focal point. Transport infrastructure occupies the underground level and first floor ‚Äì loading facilities and platforms for MTR trains on the Tung Chung and Airport Express lines occupying the sub-terranean level; while the ground level has bus stations, parking garage entrances and mechanical rooms. The Elements Mall on the upper decks takes up , with retail space occupied by luxury brands, chain stores, a cinema, a supermarket, restaurants, and an ice rink.http://zolimacitymag.com/vertical-city-part-iii-west-kowloon-walled-city/ On the roof of the Union Square shopping mall, three storeys above the ground, is a pseudo ground level public place with walkways, gardens and a central plaza surrounded by outdoor caf√©s and bars. Entrances to the various building complexes of Union Square are located on this level. Although Union Square was conceived as an interconnected space centred on transport infrastructure, it was criticised in a 2013 University of Hong Kong study as being cut off from its surroundings, especially for pedestrians. Paul Zimmerman said Union Square is \\"an island of the rich disconnected from its surroundings\\", and a lesson for future urban planners. This concern is shared by Farrell, who said there were pre-determined site constraints, and little could be done to mitigate them.

The residential complex has its own underground car park for residents. There are a lot of greenings within the estate, and the whole estate area is non-smoking. Residents need to show their resident cards before entering the estate. Visitors cannot enter without permission. Sorrento Sorrento () is a residential complex occupying the northern edge of Union Square.Wong & Ouyang (HK) Ltd.. \\"More than half-a-century of architectural design experience in Hong Kong\\", section \\"The Sorrento\\", p. 34, September 2009 The complex was built by The Wharf Estate Development Ltd. and MTR Corporation. It contains five residential towers completed in 2003 and was designed by Wong & Ouyang (HK) Ltd. The towers are named Sorrento 1 through Sorrento 6. As in many buildings in Hong Kong, tower 4 is omitted because, in Cantonese, \\"4\\" is a homophone for \\"death\\". All five towers follow the same design but reducing in height consecutively with the tallest being Sorrento 1, and the shortest, Sorrento 6. Sorrento 1 is 256 metres (841 feet) tall with 75 floors. It is the 2nd tallest residential building in Hong Kong and the 5th in the world. There are a total of 2,126 units in Sorrento. Between Sorrento 2 and Sorrento 3 is a gap, where a foot bridge connects the residential complex to Kowloon Station and Elements. The Harbourside The Harbourside () is a tall residential skyscraper in Union Square, phase 4 of the Kowloon Station development. Construction of the 74-storey complex began in 2001 and was completed in 2004 under the design by P & T Architects & Engineers. The Harbourside appears to be a one-wall building from a distance. However, there are actually three towers joined in the base, middle and top. The gaps between the towers help relieve the stress caused by wind since the complex has a large surface area, allowing it to act as a sail. All floors are used for residential purpose. The Harbourside is the 91st tallest building in the world when measured up to the highest architectural point. The Arch The Arch () is an 81-floor 231-metre (758 feet) tall skyscraper completed in 2006 in Union Square. It is the third-tallest residential building in Hong Kong, consisting of four towers: Sun Tower, Star Tower, Moon Tower, and Sky Tower. The Star Tower is connected to the Moon Tower, while the Sky Tower is connected to the Sun Tower. The Sun and Moon Towers joined on the 69th floor and above to form an arch, hence the name \\"The Arch\\". Sun Hung Kai Properties, the developer of the project, was criticised for its sales tactics of The Arch in 2005, for the practice of \\"internal sales\\" in unfinished units, the absence of sale price-lists, and also for hyping sales for flats in The Arch by announcing inflated prices (per square metre) achieved. A buyer apparently paid HK$168 million (HK$31,300 per square foot) for a penthouse. Sweeteners were allegedly given (discounts given to the same purchaser on other units bought), but were excluded from the calculation. This allowed the company to raise prices of the next batch of 500 units by 5‚Äì10 percent. However, Sun Hung Kai Properties denied the allegations. The Cullinan The Cullinan (), phase 6 of Union Square, is a residential complex developed by Sun Hung Kai Properties. It is the tallest residential complex in Hong Kong, with 68 storeys and a height of 270 metres (886 feet). It consists of two towers, the North Tower and the South Tower, both of which were completed in 2008 and 2009 consecutively. The residential complex was named after the 3,106-carat (621.2 g) Cullinan Diamond, the largest diamond in the world, found in 1905. The Cullinan complex was planned to be 45 storeys until the cancellation of Union Square phase 5. The number of floors was then increased to the current 68. International Commerce Centre The International Commerce Centre (ICC), phase 7 of Union Square, is a 118-floor, 484-meter (1,588 ft) commercial skyscraper completed in 2010, owned and jointly developed by MTR Corporation and Sun Hung Kai Properties. It is currently the world's fourth tallest as well as the tallest building in Hong Kong. The five-star Ritz-Carlton Hotel currently occupies floors 102 to 118. Shopping complex Elements, the shopping mall in Union Square, occupies . As of 2008, it had a total of 123 shops, with an ice rink, and the 1600-seat multiplex Grand Cinema which is currently the largest cinema complex in Hong Kong.MCL, Shaw ready Hong Kong's largest cinema complex Access Union Square can be accessed easily by public transportation, including MTR, Kowloon Motor Bus and minibus.

The show was supposed to serve as a vehicle for actress Mel Gorham, using her life as its basis. Pilot Synopsis The pilot of Union Square follows Mel, a small time actress who decides to quit her job working at a Miami gift shop and become a Broadway star. Armed with her wits and her large dog named Bird, Mel heads for New York City to stay with her friend Lana. She is later shocked to find that Lana and her boyfriend, Micheal (Michael Landes) broke up, resulting in Lana moving out. Mel tries to reason with Michael to let her stay with him until she can get an apartment of her own. Despite consistently telling her no, she persists and follows him to the Union Square Diner. Michael used to be a lawyer but gave it up to focus on his passion of becoming a playwright, but writes instructional manuals to make money. At the diner, she meets Carrie, a musician, who works at the diner as a waitress; Suzanne, a snarky real-estate agent; Albie, the other waiter at the diner who can be dim-witted, Jack Pappas, the hunky head chef of the diner who is known for his womanizing, and Vince, the owner of the diner. Mel goes on an audition for a Neil Simon play, but misplaces her lucky locket. She goes to the audition anyway with Michael finding it later on. However, Michael only dropped it off to her as a means of avoiding Lana, who was going to come by the diner to check on Mel. After not only failing to get the part but getting so nervous she throws up on Neil Simon, Mel reluctantly concedes she might have rushed her dreams a little. Michael cheers her up just as Lana comes to the diner. Lana reveals that Michael was not a passionate lover and didn't seem to care about their relationship. Mel helps Michael make Lana jealous and Michael agrees to let Mel stay with her, mostly out of fear for what she might have her dog do to him if he said anything to the contrary. Changes from the Pilot After poor test screenings for the pilot, the producers retooled the show and replaced Gorham with Constance Marie, who played a struggling actress named Gabriella Diaz. Once Gorham was replaced, the show was retooled into an ensemble cast format. Landes was also dropped from the program since his plot line was no longer relevant to the show's new premise. The show instead centered on the goings on around the diner and some of the ways the group helped each other with their ambitions, goals or plans.

Like The Single Guy, Union Square attempted to capitalize on attractive singles in their 20s and 30s enjoying New York City life, which both Seinfeld and Friends (as well as other NBC programs) had turned into successes. The show also featured guest appearances from actor David Krumholtz, who appeared on two episodes, as did actress Rhea Perlman, and Mario Lopez, who guest starred as a child that Suzanne sponsored. Despite these advantages and the fact that it had the #7 spot in the ratings for the 1997‚Äì98 season with almost 20 million viewers, it lost a large portion of its lead-in audience from Friends, and was cancelled after 14 episodes had been made.

It often incorporates controlled-environment agriculture, which aims to optimize plant growth, and soilless farming techniques such as hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. Some common choices of structures to house vertical farming systems include buildings, shipping containers, tunnels, and abandoned mine shafts. The modern concept of vertical farming was proposed in 1999 by Dickson Despommier, professor of Public and Environmental Health at Columbia University. Despommier and his students came up with a design of a skyscraper farm that could feed 50,000 people. Although the design has not yet been built, it successfully popularized the idea of vertical farming. Current applications of vertical farmings coupled with other state-of-the-art technologies, such as specialized LED lights, have resulted in over 10 times the crop yield than would receive through traditional farming methods. There have been several different means of implementing vertical farming systems into communities such as: Paignton, Israel, Singapore, Chicago, Munich, London, Japan, and Lincolnshire. The main advantage of utilizing vertical farming technologies is the increased crop yield that comes with a smaller unit area of land requirement. The increased ability to cultivate a larger variety of crops at once because crops do not share the same plots of land while growing is another sought-after advantage. Additionally, crops are resistant to weather disruptions because of their placement indoors, meaning less crops lost to extreme or unexpected weather occurrences. Lastly, because of its limited land usage, vertical farming is less disruptive to the native plants and animals, leading to further conservation of the local flora and fauna. Vertical farming technologies face economic challenges with large start-up costs compared to traditional farms. In Victoria, Australia, a ‚Äúhypothetical 10 level vertical farm‚Äù would cost over 850 times more per cubic meter of arable land than a traditional farm in rural Victoria. Vertical farms also face large energy demands due to the use of supplementary light like LEDs. Moreover, if non- renewable energy is used to meet these energy demands, vertical farms could produce more pollution than traditional farms or greenhouses.  Techniques of Vertical Farming  Indoor Hydroponics of Morus, Japan  Hydroponics  Hydroponics refers to the technique of growing plants without soil. In hydroponic systems, the roots of plants are submerged in liquid solutions containing macronutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, as well as trace elements, including iron, chlorine, manganese, boron, zinc, copper, and molybdenum. Additionally, inert (chemically inactive) mediums such as gravel, sand, and sawdust are used as soil substitutes to provide support for the roots. The advantages of hydroponics include the ability to increase yield per area and reduce water usage. A study has shown that, compared to conventional farming, hydroponic farming could increase the yield per area of lettuce by around 11 times while requiring 13 times less water. Due to these advantages, hydroponics is the predominant growing system used in vertical farming. Aquaponics with catfish  Aquaponics  The term aquaponics is coined by combining two words: aquaculture, which refers to fish farming, and hydroponics‚Äîthe technique of growing plants without soil. Aquaponics takes hydroponics one step further by integrating the production of terrestrial plants with the production of aquatic organisms in a closed-loop system that mimics nature itself. Nutrient- rich wastewater from the fish tanks is filtered by a solid removal unit and then led to a bio-filter, where toxic ammonia is converted to nutritious nitrate. While absorbing nutrients, the plants then purify the wastewater, which is recycled back to the fish tanks. Moreover, the plants consume carbon dioxide produced by the fish, and water in the fish tanks obtains heat and helps the greenhouse maintain temperature at night to save energy. As most commercial vertical farming systems focus on producing a few fast-growing vegetable crops, aquaponics, which also includes an aquacultural component, is currently not as widely used as conventional hydroponics.  Aeroponics  Aeroponically-grown chives The invention of aeroponics was motivated by the initiative of NASA (the National Aeronautical and Space Administration) to find an efficient way to grow plants in space in the 1990s. Unlike conventional hydroponics and aquaponics, aeroponics does not require any liquid or solid medium to grow plants in. Instead, a liquid solution with nutrients is misted in air chambers where the plants are suspended. By far, aeroponics is the most sustainable soil-less growing technique, as it uses up to 90% less water than the most efficient conventional hydroponic systems and requires no replacement of growing medium. Moreover, the absence of growing medium allows aeroponic systems to adopt a vertical design, which further saves energy as gravity automatically drains away excess liquid, whereas conventional horizontal hydroponic systems often require water pumps for controlling excess solution. Currently, aeroponic systems have not been widely applied to vertical farming, but are starting to attract significant attention.  Controlled-environment agriculture  Controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) is the modification of the natural environment to increase crop yield or extend the growing season. CEA systems are typically hosted in enclosed structures such as greenhouses or buildings, where control can be imposed on environmental factors including air, temperature, light, water, humidity, carbon dioxide, and plant nutrition. In vertical farming systems, CEA is often used in conjunction with soilless farming techniques such as hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics.  Types of Vertical Farming = Building-based Vertical Farms  Abandoned buildings are often reused for vertical farming, such as a farm at Chicago called ‚ÄúThe Plant,‚Äù which was transformed from an old meatpacking plant. However, new builds are sometimes also constructed to house vertical farming systems. For example, a company named \\"Vertical Harvest\\" built a three-story hydroponic greenhouse next to a parking lot in Jackson, Wyoming, and aims to grow 100,000 lbs of produce annually.  Shipping-container Vertical Farms  Recycled shipping containers are an increasingly popular option for housing vertical farming systems. The shipping containers serve as standardized, modular chambers for growing a variety of plants, and are often equipped with LED lighting, vertically stacked hydroponics, smart climate controls, and monitoring systems. Moreover, by stacking the shipping containers, farms can save space even further and achieve higher yield per square foot. Currently, there are many commercial shipping-container vertical-farming units on the market, such as the ‚ÄúGreenery‚Äù from Freight Farms and the ‚ÄúTerraFarm‚Äù from Local Roots.  Deep Farms  A ‚Äúdeep farm‚Äù is a vertical farm built from refurbished underground tunnels or abandoned mine shafts. As temperature and humidity underground are generally temperate and constant, deep farms require less energy for heating. Deep farms can also use nearby groundwater to reduce the cost of water supply. Despite low costs, a deep farm can produce 7 to 9 times more food than a conventional farm above ground on the same area of land, according to Saffa Riffat, chair in Sustainable Energy at the University of Nottingham. Coupled with automated harvesting systems, these underground farms can be fully self-sufficient. A company named ‚ÄúGrowing Underground‚Äù claims to have built the world's first underground farm, and is growing greens in a refurbished World War II bomb shelter 33 meters under Clapham, London. Their products are available in local supermarkets such as Whole Foods, Planet Organic, and M&S.; History= Proposal of Vertical Farming  Dickson Despommier, professor of Public and Environmental Health at Columbia University, founded the root of the concept of vertical farming. In 1999, he challenged his class of graduate students to calculate how much food they could grow on the rooftops of New York. The student concluded that they could only feed about 1000 people. Unsatisfied with the results, Despommier suggested growing plants indoors instead, on multiple layers vertically. Despommier and his students then proposed a design of a 30-story vertical farm equipped with artificial lighting, advanced hydroponics, and aeroponics that could produce enough food for 50,000 people. They further outlined that approximately 100 kinds of fruits and vegetables would grow on the upper floors while lower floors would house chickens and fish subsisting on the plant waste. Although Despommier's skyscraper farm has not yet been built, it popularized the idea of vertical farming and inspired many later designs. At the TED2016 conference in Vancouver, Astro Teller ‚Äî the head of Google X ‚Äî revealed that the secretive moonshot lab once tried to create an automated vertical farming system. X made progress in automated harvesting and efficient lighting technology, and managed to grow some greens. But the Google lab couldn't grow staple crops like grains and rice using the technique. As a result, X ultimately killed the project.  Implementations of Vertical Farming  Developers and local governments in multiple cities have expressed interest in establishing a vertical farm: Incheon (South Korea), Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates), Dongtan (China), New York City, Portland, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Seattle, Surrey, Toronto, Paris, Bangalore, Dubai, Shanghai, and Beijing. In 2009, the world's first pilot production system was installed at Paignton Zoo Environmental Park in the United Kingdom. The project showcased vertical farming and provided a solid base to research sustainable urban food production. The produce is used to feed the zoo's animals while the project enables evaluation of the systems and provides an educational resource to advocate for change in unsustainable land-use practices that impact upon global biodiversity and ecosystem services. In 2010 the Green Zionist Alliance proposed a resolution at the 36th World Zionist Congress calling on Keren Kayemet L'Yisrael (Jewish National Fund in Israel) to develop vertical farms in Israel. Moreover, a company named \\"Podponics\\" built a vertical farm in Atlanta consisting of over 100 stacked \\"growpods\\" in 2010 but reportedly went bankrupt in May 2016. In 2012 the world's first commercial vertical farm was opened in Singapore, developed by Sky Greens Farms, and is three stories high. They currently have over 100 nine meter-tall towers. In 2012, a company named The Plant debuted its newly developed vertical farming system housed in an abandoned meatpacking building in Chicago, Illinois. The utilization of abandoned buildings to house vertical farms and other sustainable farming methods are a fact of the rapid urbanization of modern communities. In 2013 the Association for Vertical Farming (AVF) was founded in Munich (Germany). By May 2015, the AVF had expanded with regional chapters all over Europe, Asia, USA, Canada and the United Kingdom. This organization unites growers and inventors to improve food security and sustainable development. The AVF focuses on advancing vertical farming technologies, designs and businesses by hosting international info-days, workshops, and summits. In 2015 the London company, Growing Underground, began the production of leafy green produce underground in abandoned underground World War II tunnels. In 2016, a startup called Local Roots launched the \\"TerraFarm\\", a vertical farming systems hosted in a 40-foot shipping container, which includes computer vision integrated with an artificial neural network to monitor the plants; and is remotely monitored from California. It is claimed that the TerraFarm system \\"has achieved cost parity with traditional, outdoor farming\\" with each unit producing the equivalent of \\"three to five acres of farmland,\\" using 97% less water through water recapture and harvesting the evaporated water through the air conditioning. The first vertical farm in a US grocery store opened in Dallas, Texas in 2016, now closed. In 2017, a Japanese company, Mirai, began marketing its multi-level vertical farming system. The company states that it can produce 10,000 heads of lettuce a day - 100 times the amount that could be produced with traditional agricultural methods, because their special purpose LED lights can decrease growing times by a factor of 2.5. Additionally, this can all be achieved with 40% less energy usage, 80% less food waste, and 99% less water usage than in traditional farming methods. Further requests have been made to implement this technology in several other Asian countries. In 2019, Kroger partnered with German startup Infarm to install modular vertical farms in two Seattle-area grocery stores. Advantages= Agricultural Efficiency  Traditional farming's arable land requirements are too large and invasive to remain sustainable for future generations. With the ever-so- rapid population growth rates, it is expected that arable land per person will drop about 66% in 2050 in comparison to 1970. Vertical farming allows for, in some cases, over ten times the crop yield per acre than traditional methods. Unlike traditional farming in non-tropical areas, indoor farming can produce crops year-round. All-season farming multiplies the productivity of the farmed surface by a factor of 4 to 6 depending on the crop. With crops such as strawberries, the factor may be as high as 30. Vertical farming also allows for the production of a larger variety of harvestable crops because of its usage of isolated crop sectors. As opposed to a traditional farm where one type of crop is harvested per season, vertical farms allow for a multitude of different crops to be grown and harvested at once due to their individual land plots. According to the USDA, vertical farm produce only travels a short distance to reach stores compared to traditional farming method produce. The United States Department of Agriculture predicts the worldwide population to exceed 9 billion by 2050, most of which will be living in urban or city areas. Vertical farming is the USDA's predicted answer to the potential food shortage as population increases. This method of farming is environmentally responsible by lowering emission and reducing needed water. This type of urban farming that would allow for nearly immediate farm to store transport would reduce distribution. In a workshop on vertical farming put on by the USDA and the Department of Energy experts in vertical farming discussed plant breeding, pest management, and engineering. Control of pests (like insects, birds and rodents) is easily managed in vertical farms, because the area is so well- controlled. Without the need of chemical pesticides the ability to grow organic crops is easier than in traditional farming.  Resistance to Weather  Crops grown in traditional outdoor farming depend on supportive weather and suffer from undesirable temperatures, rain, monsoon, hailstorm, tornado, flooding, wildfires, and drought. \\"Three recent floods (in 1993, 2007 and 2008) cost the United States billions of dollars in lost crops, with even more devastating losses in topsoil. Changes in rain patterns and temperature could diminish India's agricultural output by 30 percent by the end of the century.\\" The issue of adverse weather conditions is especially relevant for arctic and sub-arctic areas like Alaska and northern Canada where traditional farming is largely impossible. Food insecurity has been a long-standing problem in remote northern communities where fresh produce has to be shipped large distances resulting in high costs and poor nutrition. Container-based farms can provide fresh produce year-round at a lower cost than shipping in supplies from more southerly locations with a number of farms operating in locations such as Churchill, Manitoba, and Unalaska, Alaska. As with disruption to crop growing, local container-based farms are also less susceptible to disruption than the long supply chains necessary to deliver traditionally grown produce to remote communities. Food prices in Churchill spiked substantially after floods in May and June 2017 forced the closure of the rail line that forms the only permanent overland connection between Churchill and the rest of Canada.  Environmental Conservation  Up to 20 units of outdoor farmland per unit of vertical farming could return to its natural state, due to vertical farming's increased productivity. Vertical farming would reduce the amount of farmland, thus saving many natural resources. Deforestation and desertification caused by agricultural encroachment on natural biomes could be avoided. Producing food indoors reduces or eliminates conventional plowing, planting, and harvesting by farm machinery, protecting soil, and reducing emissions. Traditional farming is often invasive to the native flora and fauna because it requires such a large area of arable land. One study showed that wood mouse populations dropped from 25 per hectare to 5 per hectare after harvest, estimating 10 animals killed per hectare each year with conventional farming. In comparison, vertical farming would cause nominal harm to wildlife because of its limited space usage. Problems= Economics  Vertical farms must overcome the financial challenge of large startup costs. The initial building costs would exceed $100 million, for a 60 hectare vertical farm. Office occupancy costs can be high in major cities, with office space in cities such as Tokyo, Moscow, Mumbai, Dubai, Milan, Zurich, and Sao Paulo ranging from $1850 to $880 per square meter. Since vertical farms are meant to be located in the centers of major cities, owners of vertical farms would have to pay the occupancy costs that any other office in the same zone would have to pay. In Victoria, Australia a hypothetical 10-level vertical farm would have a cost of US$349 per square meter of arable land, whereas a traditional farm in rural Victoria would have a cost of US$0.40 per square meter of arable land. Eventually as vertical farms become more efficient, the startup cost will be overcome, however even a vertical farm with a yield per hectare factor 50 times larger than a traditional farm's yield, it would take 6‚Äì7 years for the vertical farm to break even in costs. Opponents question the potential profitability of vertical farming. In order for vertical farms to be successful financially, high value crops must be grown since traditional farms provide low value crops like wheat at cheaper costs than a vertical farm. Louis Albright, a professor in biological and environmental engineering at Cornell stated that a loaf of bread that was made from wheat grown in a vertical farm would cost US$27. However, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average loaf of bread cost US$1.296 in September 2019, clearly showing how crops grown in vertical farms will be noncompetitive compared to crops grown in traditional outdoor farms. In order for vertical farms to be profitable, the costs of operating these farms must decrease. The developers of the TerraFarm system produced from second hand, 40 foot shipping containers claimed that their system \\"has achieved cost parity with traditional, outdoor farming\\". However urban or island land also has high value, in a PNAS published study, 10 storey vertical wheat farm could produce approximately 1,940 metric tons of wheat on a given hectare of land versus good years typically produce on average 3.2 tons of wheat per hectare (600 times yield), and theoretically these storeys could still be above or below other buildings. Compared with costs of land reclamation on crowded islands, it appears there can be niche markets for even vertical low value per kg cereal farming, although current methods still require enormous energy consumption for lighting, temprerature, and humidity control, not to mention carbon dioxide input and fertilizer costs. Energy Use During the growing season, the sun shines on a vertical surface at an extreme angle such that much less light is available to crops than when they are planted on flat land. Therefore, supplemental light would be required. Bruce Bugbee claimed that the power demands of vertical farming would be uncompetitive with traditional farms using only natural light. Environmental writer George Monbiot calculated that the cost of providing enough supplementary light to grow the grain for a single loaf would be about $15. An article in the Economist argued that \\"even though crops growing in a glass skyscraper will get some natural sunlight during the day, it won't be enough\\" and \\"the cost of powering artificial lights will make indoor farming prohibitively expensive\\". Moreover, researchers determined that if only solar panels were to be used to meet the energy consumption of a vertical farm, ‚Äúthe area of solar panels required would need to be a factor of twenty times greater than the arable area on a multi-level indoor farm‚Äù, which will be hard to accomplish with larger vertical farms. A hydroponic farm growing lettuce in Arizona would require 15,000 kJ of energy per kilogram of lettuce produced. To put this amount of energy into perspective, a traditional outdoor lettuce farm in Arizona only requires 1100 kJ of energy per kilogram of lettuce grown. As the book by Dr. Dickson Despommier \\"The Vertical Farm\\" proposes a controlled environment, heating and cooling costs will resemble those of any other multiple story building. Plumbing and elevator systems are necessary to distribute nutrients and water. In the northern continental United States, fossil fuel heating cost can be over $200,000 per hectare. Research conducted in 2015 compared the growth of lettuce in Arizona using conventional agricultural methods and a hydroponic farm. They determined that heating and cooling made up more than 80% of the energy consumption in the hydroponic farm, with the heating and cooling needing 7400 kJ per kilogram of lettuce produced. According to the same study, the total energy consumption of the hydroponic farm is 90,000 kJ per kilogram of lettuce. If the energy consumption is not addressed, vertical farms may be an unsustainable alternative to traditional agriculture. Pollution There are a number of interrelated challenges with some potential solutions: * Power needs: If power needs are met by fossil fuels, the environmental effect may be a net loss; even building low-carbon capacity to power the farms may not make as much sense as simply leaving traditional farms in place, while burning less coal. Louis Albright argued that in a ‚Äúclosed-system urban farming based on electrically generated photosynthetic light‚Äù, a pound of lettuce would result in 8 pounds of carbon dioxide being produced at a power plant, and 4,000 pounds of lettuce produced would be equivalent to the annual emissions of a family car. He also argues that the carbon footprint of tomatoes grown in a similar system would be twice as big as the carbon footprint of lettuce. However, lettuce produced in a greenhouse that allows for sunlight to reach the crops saw a 300 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions per head of lettuce. As vertical farm system become more efficient in harnessing sunlight, they will produce less pollution. * Carbon emission: A vertical farm requires a CO2 source, most likely from combustion if colocated with electric utility plants; absorbing CO2 that would otherwise be jettisoned is possible. Greenhouses commonly supplement carbon dioxide levels to 3‚Äì4 times the atmospheric rate. This increase in CO2 increases photosynthesis at varying rates, averaging 50%, contributing not only to higher yields, but also to faster plant maturation, shrinking of pores and greater resilience to water stress (both too much and little). Vertical farms need not exist in isolation, hardier mature plants could be transferred to traditional greenhouse, freeing up space and increasing cost flexibility. * Crop damage: Some greenhouses burn fossil fuels purely to produce CO2, such as from furnaces, which contain pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and ethylene. These pollutants can significantly damage plants, so gas filtration is a component of high production systems. * Ventilation: \\"Necessary\\" ventilation may allow CO2 to leak into the atmosphere, though recycling systems could be devised. This is not limited to humidity tolerant and humidity intolerant crop polyculture cycling (as opposed to monoculture). * Light Pollution: Greenhouse growers commonly exploit photoperiodism in plants to control whether the plants are in a vegetative or reproductive stage. As part of this control, the lights stay on past sunset and before sunrise or periodically throughout the night. Single story greenhouses have attracted criticism over light pollution, though a typical urban vertical farm may also produce light pollution. * Water Pollution: Hydroponic greenhouses regularly change the water, producing water containing fertilizers and pesticides that must be disposed of. Spreading the effluent over neighboring farmland or wetlands would be difficult for an urban vertical farm, while water treatment remedies (natural or otherwise) could be part of a solution.

Early life Dallas Stoudenmire was born in Aberfoil, Bullock County, Alabama. He was one of the nine children of Lewis and Elizabeth Stoudenmire. Shortly after the American Civil War began, Stoudenmire enlisted in the Army of the Confederacy, even though he was only 15 years old. Although he was six feet tall, his officers discovered his age and discharged him. He re-enlisted twice moreNOTE: The Civil War Soldiers and Sailors system reports a Pvt D. Stoudenmire Co F of the 17th Alabama Infantry; and a Pvt D. Stowdemire Co C, 6th Alabama Cavalry and eventually was allowed to serve as a private in Company F, 45th Alabama Infantry Regiment. According to surviving records, he stood 6'4\\" (1.94 m) tall by the war's end and was wounded numerous times. He carried two bullets in his body for the remainder of his life. Following the war, Stoudenmire drifted west and served for at least three years with the Texas Rangers. He had a reputation for being handsome, a sharp dresser and a gentleman around ladies. But when intoxicated, he could be extremely dangerous and had a quick temper. He was known for his habit of wearing two guns and being equally accurate with either hand. He disappeared from the records between 1874 and 1878, possibly residing in Mexico for a time. He was able to speak Spanish fairly well, and is known to have worked during the years immediately after the war as a sheep farmer, wheelwright, proprietor, merchandiser and carpenter. Career as a lawman He resurfaced when he served as a town marshal for Socorro, New Mexico. While employed there, his brother-in-law and El Paso, Texas resident, Stanley \\"Doc\\" Cummings, convinced him to take up a job as town marshal in El Paso. The city was seeking to hire an outsider with a \\"rough reputation\\". At that time, El Paso was a remote, lawless boomtown. Stoudenmire traveled to El Paso by stagecoach and was soon hired. This was the beginning of the end of a wild and violent El Paso and the beginning of his fame. Marshal Stoudenmire started his tenure in El Paso on Monday, April 11, 1881. He was the sixth town marshal in eight months. The City Council asked him to take the city jail keys from deputy marshal and town drunkard, Bill Johnson. Witnesses alleged that Stoudenmire approached an intoxicated Johnson asking for the jail keys. Johnson mumbled that he would go home and figure out which keys were his and which were the city's. Stoudenmire became impatient and demanded he hand over the keys right away. When Johnson demurred, the marshal physically turned Johnson upside down, grabbed the keys, then threw him to the ground. Johnson was publicly humiliated. On Thursday, April 14, 1881, only three days into his new job, Stoudenmire became involved in one of the most famous gunfights in Old West history, called the \\"Four Dead in Five Seconds Gunfight.\\" This gunfight was well publicized in newspapers in cities as far away as San Francisco and New York City. The events began a mile (1.6 km) south, at the Rio Grande which divided the U.S. and Mexico. Roughly 75 heavily armed Mexican cowboys galloped into El Paso, looking for two missing young Mexican cowboys, S√°nchez and Jauregui, plus thirty cattle stolen from a ranch just across the river. The missing animals belonged to a wealthy Mexican who hired an armed posse to recover them. El Paso County Constable Gus Krempkau was asked by the Mexican leader to lead them to a possible location. Krempkau agreed. The bodies of the two missing Mexicans were discovered near Johnny Hale's ranch about northwest of El Paso. Hale was a ranch owner and cattle rustler. The bodies were taken back to town. Records indicated that the young Mexican cowboys were searching for the stolen cattle. Two American cattle rustlers, Peveler and Stevenson, were accused of the murders after they were overheard bragging about killing the two cowboys when they found them trailing the herd to Hale's ranch. A large crowd gathered in El Paso, including John Hale and his friend, former town marshal George Campbell. There was animosity and worries among the Americans about the dangerous situation of enraged Mexicans demanding justice for the slain men while being heavily armed within the city limits. Constable Krempkau was fluent in Spanish and was required to interpret for the judge at the inquest now held in court. The two Americans were formally charged with the murders and immediately arrested, being scheduled for trial at a later date. The court was adjourned and the crowd dispersed. The armed Mexicans, now calm, took the two corpses back to Mexico for proper burial. Four Dead in Five Seconds Gunfight On April 14, 1881 Constable Krempkau went into a saloon to retrieve his rifle and pistol. A confrontation erupted with George Campbell over comments allegedly made by Campbell about Krempkau. A heavily intoxicated John Hale, who was allegedly unarmed and upset by Krempkau's role in the investigation, pulled one of Campbell's two pistols and shot Krempkau. Stoudenmire was eating dinner at a restaurant across the street. Hearing the gunfire, he ran out and started shooting, killing first an innocent Mexican bystander, then Hale. When Campbell saw Hale drop dead, he tried to stop the fight. However, Krempkau, believing that Campbell had shot him, fired at him before losing consciousness. One of Krempkau's bullets struck Campbell's gun, which broke his wrist and dropped the gun while the other bullet struck his foot. Campbell screamed, but managed to scoop up his gun again. Stoudenmire whirled and fired, killing him. After the gunfight This gunfight made Stoudenmire a legend, but it eventually had deadly consequences. Although his reputation as a gunman would continue to grow with later gunfights, he had few friends in El Paso, whereas both Campbell and Hale had had many. Eventually, Stoudenmire stood alone in his own defense of his actions . As often was the case, a shooting being justified meant very little in towns of the Old West, and vendettas were common. Three days after the gunfight, on April 17, 1881, James Manning (he and his brothers were friends to Hale and Campbell) convinced former Deputy Marshal Bill Johnson to assassinate Stoudenmire. Johnson was known to have a profound hatred and grudge against Stoudenmire for publicly humiliating him. That same night, Johnson, heavily intoxicated, squatted behind a large pillar of bricks with a loaded double-barreled shotgun and waited. When he heard the voices of Stoudenmire and his brother-in-law, Stanley \\"Doc\\" Cummings, his legs started to wobble and he fell backward, accidentally firing both shells into the air. Stoudenmire quickly pulled out his pistols and fired at Johnson eight times, severing his testicles. Johnson bled to death within a few minutes. This started a feud between Stoudenmire and the Mannings. Within six days of his having started his job as town marshal, Stoudenmire had killed four men, one accidentally. Between the killing of Johnson and the following February, Stoudenmire killed another six men in shootouts during arrests. The city's crime rate dropped dramatically. His reputation, as both a lawman and a gunman, increased. On February 14, 1882, James Manning killed \\"Doc\\" Cummings, supposedly while acting in self- defense after an earlier argument that evening had escalated. Manning claimed that Cummings had pulled his pistol and verbally threatened to kill him outside the saloon when an innocent bystander walked by. Cummings whirled and growled, \\"Now, are you not one of his friends?\\" The bystander squealed his innocence, but Cummings allowed him to go provided that he walked with his arms up in the air into the darkness of night. Cummings then turned and realized that Manning had gone back inside the saloon. Cummings entered and again verbally threatened to kill him. Manning left the bar briefly and appeared in the hallway. Armed with his pistols, Manning snapped, \\"We will settle this for now and all.\\" In an instant, gunfire erupted from both sides. Hit, Cummings staggered out across a wooden sidewalk toppling backward onto the dusty street as he screamed in agony then died. Manning was acquitted in a trial attended by a large number of local residents who were friends of the Mannings. This enraged Stoudenmire. Unfortunately for El Paso, Cummings had been the only man able to confront or control Stoudenmire's fierce temper. He began to publicly confront those responsible for James Manning's acquittal and caused many to avoid coming into town or visiting saloons for fear of running into an enraged Stoudenmire. Despite his prowess and expertise with handguns, and his effectiveness as a lawman, Stoudenmire was still an 'outsider.' He was well respected by the Texas Rangers and the U.S. Marshals. However, locally, he had several things against him. He was not from El Paso, had no family there other than his own family and his now deceased brother-in-law; the Mannings had been in El Paso longer and had many friends in the general population as well as in high places in the city government. Stoudenmire had only two things in his favor; he had dramatically lowered El Paso's violent crime rate more than any who came before him, and people truly feared him. On May 27, 1882, the town council announced the firing of Stoudenmire. He walked into the council hall, drunk, and dared them to take his guns or his job. He pulled and twirled his guns and threatened, \\"I can straddle every God-damned alderman on this council!\\" They attempted to calm him by telling him he could keep his job. However, after sobering up, he resigned on his own on May 29, 1882 and became a proprietor of the Globe Restaurant, which had formerly belonged to Cummings. He was then appointed Deputy U.S. Marshal for Western Texas and New Mexico Territory by U.S. Marshal Harrington Lee \\"Hal\\" Gosling. U.S. marshal and death in shoot-out For a few months, Stoudenmire served well as a Deputy U.S. Marshal. However, the feud was far from over. The Mannings, mainly \\"Doc\\" Manning (d.1925), James Manning (d.1915), and Frank Manning (d.1925), were careful to never confront Stoudenmire alone. Despite their hatred of him, he had shown his skill with a gun on several occasions and this made them wary. On one instance, while standing out in the street, a drunken Stoudenmire mocked them, daring them to come outside and fight him. They remained inside a saloon while other residents attempted to convince Stoudenmire to go away and sleep off his intoxication. Eventually he grew tired, called the Mannings cowards, and left. On September 18, 1882, the Mannings and Stoudenmire met in a local saloon, to make what they would call a \\"peace treaty\\" to end the feud. James Manning, believing things were settled, left. Stoudenmire started off saying, \\"Doc, someone or somebody has been going about telling lies...\\". Doc replied, \\"Dallas, you have not kept your word.\\" \\"Who ever says I have not tells a damn lie,\\" Stoudenmire roared. Manning and Stoudenmire drew their pistols and fired. Stoudenmire's friend tried to push both men, causing Stoudenmire to lose his balance and Doc's bullet hit Stoudenmire in his left arm. A second round barely penetrated Stoudenmire's skin because of papers folded heavily in his shirt pocket. Nonetheless, the second shot knocked Stoudenmire down. As he fell outside the doorway, he pulled one of his pistols with his right hand and shot \\"Doc\\" Manning in the arm. As Stoudenmire was firing, James Manning came from behind Stoudenmire and fired two rounds, one hitting a barber's pole, and the other hitting Stoudenmire behind the left ear, killing him. \\"Doc\\" Manning then commenced beating the dead man over the head with his own gun, before being restrained by James Manning. A funeral ceremony for Stoudenmire was held at El Paso Lodge #130 A.F. & A.M. His wife, Isabella, later had his body shipped to Columbus, Texas for burial. All funeral expenses were paid for by the Masonic Lodge. Stoudenmire is buried in the Alleyton Cemetery in Colorado County, Texas. The Mannings stood trial for the murder, but were acquitted, again with a jury made up mostly of their friends. They continued to live in El Paso, and soon the killing of Dallas Stoudenmire was all but forgotten. When Assistant City Marshal Thomas Moad was killed while investigating a disturbance at a local brothel on July 11, 1883, Frank Manning was appointed to replace him. He only kept the job temporarily, as he often failed to arrest friends and acquaintances. Bibliography * Metz, Leon Claire; 1979. Dallas Stoudenmire: El Paso Marshal.

A Democrat, she served one term in the United States House of Representatives from 1993 to 1995. Schenk was born in 1945, in the Bronx, the daughter of a Holocaust survivor.San Diego Jewish Journal, October 2003 She attended public schools in the Bronx and Los Angeles, and graduated from Hamilton High School. She received her B.A. from U.C.L.A. in 1967 and her J.D. from the University of San Diego School of Law in 1970. There were only three other women in her law class. Schenk did post-graduate study in international law at the London School of Economics. In 1971, with two other female lawyers, Schenk broke the gender barrier at The Grant Grill in the downtown San Diego U. S. Grant Hotel. Women were prohibited during lunch, so a male friend made a reservation and the three women went in to eat, unescorted. They ordered mock turtle soup, a specialty not available in the hotel's other restaurants. After trying to push them out the door, the staff seated them. The three continued to come back until a \\"No women before 3 p.m.\\" sign was removed. The next year, she and other women formed the Lawyers Club of San Diego,History page at Lawyers Club of San Diego website. which worked for passage of the Equal Rights Amendment and on other women's rights issues. Schenk worked as a White House Fellow, under Vice Presidents Nelson A. Rockefeller and Walter Mondale, as a deputy attorney general in the office of the California Attorney General, and as an attorney for San Diego Gas and Electric. California Governor Jerry Brown appointed her deputy secretary, and later secretary, of the California Business, Transportation and Housing Agency from 1977 until 1983. After Brown decided not to run for a third term, she returned to private practice. In 1984, she ran against Republican Susan Golding for San Diego County Supervisor. Late in the race, Golding's campaign allegedly mailed out a piece of literature accusing Schenk of financial irregularities. Schenk lost 45% to 55%. She later sued Golding for slander and won $150,000. In 1992, Schenk won the Democratic nomination to run for Congress from California's 49th congressional district, covering most of San Diego. Redistricting after the 1990 U.S. Census had created an open seat in much of an area previously represented by six-term Republican incumbent Bill Lowery. Schenk won, becoming the first Democrat to represent the area in 40 years. She was defeated for reelection in 1994 by Brian Bilbray, the Republican mayor of Imperial Beach. After serving in Congress, Schenk served in various positions in the California state government under California Governor Gray Davis, including Chief of Staff, from 1998 until Davis was recalled in 2003. As Chief of Staff, she didn't \\"suffer fools\\" and was responsible for much of the \\"centrist\\" policy of the Davis Administration. Currently, Schenk practices corporate law. She sits on the boards of various organizations including The Scripps Research Institute Board of Trustees, and the California High-Speed Rail Authority She remains active in California and national politics. Schenk was married to University of San Diego law professor C. Hugh Friedman, who died on January 29, 2013. Schenk lives in San Diego. Schenk has served on the board of the California High Speed Rail Authority since 2003 when she was appointed by Gov. Gray Davis. She serves as Vice Chairperson in 2011. Lynn Schenk was nominated and inducted into the Women's Hall of Fame in 2012 for the title of Trailblazer, meaning, women who have paved the way for other women, or were the first in their field. The annual Women's Hall of Fame induction is co- hosted by Women's Museum of California (Located in San Diego), Commission on the Status of Women, UC San Diego Women's Center, and San Diego State Women's Studies.

Born in Northampton, he attended Sponne School in Towcester, Northamptonshire. He was primarily a right-arm off- spinner, and also a capable late-order batsman with four first-class centuries, and often fielded at second slip. After initially playing for his home county Northamptonshire, for whom he made his debut in 1997, he moved to Nottinghamshire in 2005. Swann played a single One Day International against South Africa in 2000, before losing his place in the squad. Seven years later he was chosen to accompany England on its tour of Sri Lanka as the team's second spin bowler, alongside Monty Panesar, and subsequently cemented a regular place in England's Test team, playing throughout England's 2‚Äì1 victory in the 2009 Ashes. In December 2009, he became the first English spinner to take 50 wickets in a calendar year, culminating in back-to-back man of the match awards in the first two Tests of the tour of South Africa and rising to third place in the world rankings for bowlers. In March 2010, Swann became the first English off-spinner since Jim Laker to take 10 wickets in a match when he achieved the feat in England's victory in the first Test in Bangladesh. In May, he was named ECB Cricketer of the Year. In 2011 Swann was part of the England team that claimed the No. 1 ranking in Test cricket and between July and October that year was the No. 1 ranked bowler in ODIs. During the 2013‚Äì14 Ashes series loss, he retired from international cricket on 21 December 2013 with immediate effect. After retirement, Swann took part in the BBC television show Strictly Come Dancing. Career=Early years (1998‚Äì2007) Swann began his domestic career for Northamptonshire. As a teenager, he was part of the U-19 World Cup winning side in 1998, a tournament that took part in South Africa (alongside future England players Owais Shah and Robert Key). Swann bowling for Nottinghamshire against Leicestershire in 2007 Against Leicestershire in 1998 he scored 92 and 111, his maiden first-class half- century and century. Touring South Africa and Zimbabwe with the England A-team that winter, Swann took 21 wickets at 25.61 and averaged 22 with the bat. Wisden commented, In 1999, Swann was brought into the England squad for the final Test against New Zealand. He did not play, but featured in an ODI against South Africa following an injury to Ashley Giles. This tour also saw him miss the team bus once due to oversleeping. In domestic cricket, Swann scored his highest first-class score of 183 in 2002, sharing a partnership of 318 with Northants captain Mike Hussey (310 not out). He moved to Nottinghamshire in 2005, and finished the season of 2007 with 516 runs and 45 wickets, leading to his recall to the England side against Sri Lanka. While England fell heavily in defeat during the first match, Swann hit 34 to help seal victory in the second, and took four for 34 and hit 25 in the third as England took a two-one lead in the series. An unsuccessful tour of New Zealand followed, and Swann was unable consistently to occupy a place in the England ODI side. He remained in the squad but faced tough competition from Samit Patel, who had already taken his first ODI five-wicket haul, against South Africa in his third match. Test breakthrough (2008‚Äì2009) Following a loss of form by Monty Panesar, alongside whom Swann had played for Northamptonshire, Swann made his Test debut against India in December 2008, and made an immediate impact, dismissing Gautam Gambhir with his third delivery and Rahul Dravid with his sixth, both lbw, thus becoming only the second player in Test history after Richard Johnson (also for England) to take two wickets in his first Test over. In the Third Test in the West Indies in February 2009, he was brought back into the Test fold following the poor form of Panesar, and in this match collected his first five-wicket haul in a Test, 5 for 57 in the West Indies' first innings, including two wickets in two balls. This was the second-best performance ever by any spinner in Antigua. Swann also collected five wickets in the first of the West Indian innings in the Fourth Test. In addition to a score of 63 not out batting at 9, he took six more wickets in the first home Test of 2009, again against the West Indies, at Lord's. This included three for sixteen in five overs in the first innings, removing Devon Smith, Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Brendan Nash. At the end of the one-day series against the same opposition, the England players were permitted to rejoin their counties in the build-up to the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 tournament. Swann gave a good account of himself in the World Twenty20, bowling tidily for his five wickets \\"while showing the passion for playing for his country that,\\" according to journalist Nick Hoult, \\"endears him to England supporters.\\" The Ashes (2009) The players lined up at the start of the 2009 Ashes. England won the series 2‚Äì1, reclaiming the trophy from Australia. Swann bowling during the third Test of the 2009 Ashes Swann had done enough in the year preceding the 2009 Ashes to be considered England's premier spinner, overtaking Panesar. The pertinent question was not whether Swann would play, but which of Panesar and Adil Rashid, the other two spinners in the England squad, would play with him. He went on to play in all five matches of the series. Panesar was selected for the first Test, but his bowling did not impress and he was dropped for the remainder of the series, leaving Swann as England's only slow bowler. In the first Test at Sophia Gardens, Swann hit a first-innings 47 not out from 40 balls. His bowling was anodyne, failing to pick up a wicket in 38 overs in Australia's only innings, in which they amassed 674 for 6 declared with four centurions, but his second- innings 31 helped England salvage a draw, as Australia were unable to take the final English wicket with Panesar and James Anderson at the crease. At Lord's, Swann was part of England's first-innings slide from 302 for 3 (Andrew Strauss 161) to 425 all out, and was only required to bowl one over in Australia's first innings, as England's seamers combined to bowl Australia out for 215. However, in Australia's second innings, after Michael Clarke and Brad Haddin had briefly made a mammoth 522-run target seem attainable, Swann combined with Andrew Flintoff (5 for 92) to bowl Australia out, taking the key wicket of Michael Clarke bowled for 136. Swann took the final wicket of Mitchell Johnson, bowled for 63, to finish with second-innings figures of 4 for 87 and complete England's first victory against Australia at Lord's since 1934. At Edgbaston, Swann was only required to bowl two first-innings overs, but nonetheless made England's first breakthrough, trapping Simon Katich lbw to end an 85-run opening partnership. With the bat he contributed 24 from 20 balls as England's lower-middle order powered the side to a 113-run first- innings lead, and with England pursuing victory he clean bowled Ricky Ponting with a sharply turning offbreak, but on the final day his bowling was anodyne, failing to take another wicket as Australia drew the match with ease, losing only three wickets on the final day. At Headingley Swann made a duck in England's first-innings collapse to 102 all out, and failed to take a wicket in Australia's total of 445. In the second innings he hit a defiant 62 but could not stave off an innings defeat. England therefore progressed to the Oval with the series level at 1‚Äì1 and with a victory required to regain the Ashes. Swann took 4 for 38, combining with Stuart Broad (5 for 37) to bowl Australia out for 160. He hit a 55-ball 63 in England's second innings, sharing a 13-over partnership of 90 with debutant Jonathan Trott (119). On the final day of the series Swann made England's first breakthrough in the fourth over of the day, trapping Simon Katich lbw. He claimed figures of 4 for 120, taking his tally of wickets to eight in the match, including the final wicket, Mike Hussey caught at short leg by Alastair Cook for 121, to clinch the Ashes series. He finished the series with an aggregate of 249 runs (fourth in England's list) at an average of 35.57, and 14 wickets (second among England's bowlers only to Stuart Broad). Following the Ashes, the two sides faced each other in a seven-match ODI series. After losing the first six, England managed a win in the final fixture; Swann took 5/28 in the match, his first five- wicket haul in ODIs. South Africa and Bangladesh (2009‚Äì2010) Centurion Cricket Ground, where Swann scored his Test-best innings of 85 in December 2009 and was awarded a man of the Match award for his all-round performance. In December, England toured South Africa for a four-Test series. Expected to be a close contest, the series was tied 1‚Äì1. Swann contributed 21 wickets, and was the leading wicket-taker on either side in country not historically suited to spin bowlers. Ashwell Prince suffered in particular against Swann's bowling, and was dismissed three times from five deliveries by Swann. His lower-order batting also proved useful, helping save one match, and his Test- best knock of 85 in the first fixture was the highest score of the England innings. His performance in the second Test meant that Swann finished his first full year of Test cricket ranked third in the world bowling rankings, behind Dale Steyn and Mitchell Johnson. As well as Man of the Match awards in the first and second Tests, Swann received a tied man of the series award along with Mark Boucher. England's next assignment was a tour of Bangladesh in March 2010. The ODI series was a 3‚Äì0 whitewash for England, with Swann taking seven wickets, behind just seamer Tim Bresnan with eight. Even with a weakened side, taking the opportunity to blood new players, England were expected to easily win the two-match Test series. In the first match Swann took his maiden ten-wicket haul in Tests; it was the first time an off-spinner had taken ten wickets in a match for England since Jim Laker took 19 against Australia at Old Trafford in 1956. The pitch at Chittagong offered little for fast bowlers, leaving Swann with the bulk of the work. The performance, claiming 10/217 from 78.3 overs, earned him the Man of the Match award and raised him to second place in the ICC's Test bowling rankings. Claiming six wickets in the second Test to guide England to a 2‚Äì0 whitewash, Swann was named Man of the Series. 2010 World Twenty20 The Kensington Oval in Barbados hosted the final of the 2010 World Twenty20, which England won by seven wickets. Swann was selected in England's 15 man squad for the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 in the West Indies. During the tournament, Swann played in all of England's fixtures, including the final against Australia, where he dismissed Australia captain Michael Clarke for 27 on his way to figures of 1/17 from his 4 overs. In the field he alertly caught Shane Watson in the slips after wicketkeeper Craig Kieswetter parried the ball toward Swann. Swann finished the tournament with 10 wickets at an average of 14.40, with best figures of 3/24 against South Africa in the super eights. Swann's performances won widespread applause for his ability to adapt to the different forms of the game and to retain control over his bowling. In May, he was named ECB Cricketer of the Year. The ECB declared his international career to be a \\"remarkable 12 months in which his attacking offspin and hard-hitting lower-order batting have proved instrumental in one of the most successful years that the England cricket team has ever known.\\" Pakistan (2010) Pakistan toured England in August and September. Swann was ever-present in the four match Test series which England won 3‚Äì1, although he was only needed to bowl two overs in the first Test as the seamers bowled Pakistan out for 182 and 80. Swann also was not required in the first innings of the second Test at Edgbaston, before taking Test-best figures of 6‚Äì65 in the second innings as England took a 2‚Äì0 series lead. At The Oval, Pakistan won by 4 wickets, though Swann did take match figures of 7‚Äì118. In a remarkable Test at Lord's, England won by an innings and 225 runs victory, despite being 102‚Äì7 in their innings, with Swann taking 4‚Äì12 and 5‚Äì62. The latter achievement saw his name go on the Lord's honours board for the first time, however the match was overshadowed by newspaper allegations of Pakistan players being involved in spot-fixing. 2010‚Äì11 Ashes England toured Australia during the winter for the away Ashes series, England won the series 3‚Äì1 with Swann playing a vital role in holding up an end. He had success in the second test at Adelaide taking 7 wickets in the match and a match winning 5 wicket haul. He finished the series with 15 wickets at an average of 39.80, economy of 2.72 and a strike rate of 87.6, these figures are much greater to that of the several Australian spinners, Xavier Doherty and Michael Beer, with the latter making his debut in the final test at Sydney. Graeme Swann played a pivotal role in England's series success down under, with control and his wicket taking abilities when needed. He ended 2010 as England retained and then won the Ashes series in Australia, as the second highest-ranked bowler in world cricket, and the highest ranked spin bowler. World Cup and 2011 English season Swann bowling against Sri Lanka at Lord's in June 2011 Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka hosted the 2011 World Cup between February and April. England selected three spinners in their 15-man squad including Swann. England were knocked out in the quarter-finals. With 12 wickets from seven matches, Swann finished as England's highest wicket-taker in the tournament. Sri Lanka toured England in May. In the first Test Swann took 7/82 to help England to an innings victory. After winning the first match, England drew the second and third to win the series. Swann was the second-most productive bowler in the series, taking 12 wickets in the series at an average of 23.58, and was ranked as the second best Test bowler in the world. England won the following five-match ODI series 3‚Äì2. Swann took eight wickets and in the process rose to the No. 1 spot in the ICC's ODI bowler rankings. It was the first time since Steve Harmison in 2004 that an England bowler had held the No. 1 position in either Test or ODI cricket. India toured in July. By winning the first three Tests, England deposed India as the No. 1 ranked Test team and took their place. England's seam attack troubled India's batsmen, leaving Swann little to do and he was restricted to four wickets at a cost of more than 80 runs each from the first three matches. However, in the final Test Swann's fortunes changed and he took nine wickets, including his 11th five-wicket haul in Tests, to help England to an innings victory and take the series in a 4‚Äì0 whitewash. A batch of new faces in India's squad for the subsequent ODI series was expected to prove a new challenge, however England won the series 3‚Äì0. Swann was leading wicket-taker in the series, with eight. When the West Indies toured in September for two T20Is. Both the regular captain and vice-captain, Stuart Broad and Eoin Morgan respectively, were injured at the time and Swann led the team in their absence. England toured India in October for five ODIs. After taking two wickets from four matches, and England lost the series 5‚Äì0, Swann dropped to third in the ICC's ODI bowler rankings. Tours of UAE and Sri Lanka 2012 The new year began with England's tour of the UAE where they played three Tests and five ODIs against Pakistan. England lost all three Tests as their batsmen struggled to adapt to Asian pitches, particularly the bowling of off-spinner Saeed Ajmal. On surfaces that suited spin bowling, 75 wickets in the series fell to spinners. He claimed 13 wickets at an average of 25.07, and dropped to sixth in the ICC's Test bowling rankings. England bounced back to complete a 4‚Äì0 whitewash in the subsequent ODI series, and Swann contributed two wickets from three matches. Swann was one of 144 players who put their names forward for the auction ahead of the 2012 Indian Premier League; though he was one of three players given the highest possible reserve price of $400,000 he was not bought by any of the franchises. England toured Sri Lanka for two Tests beginning in March. The series was drawn 1‚Äì1 and Swann took ten wickets in England's victory in the second Test. His worth to the team was recognised when the Professional Cricketers' Association named Swann England's Most Valued Player of the winter and gave him a ¬£2,000 prize. Speaking of the award, Swann said \\"It is nice to win any award but it is especially pleasing to win one where you are compared to your team-mates on hard statistics\\". Elbow problems and recovery (2012‚Äì13) Swann batting during the 2013‚Äì14 Ashes in Australia South Africa's tour of England was billed in the press as the clash of the two best Test teams in world cricket. Though England had lost to Pakistan and drawn with Sri Lanka in the winter, English conditions were expected to favour their seam bowlers and spin would play a less significant role in the series. At Headingley England opted for an all pace bowling attack, leaving Swann out of the side for the first time in 43 Tests. In the event Kevin Pietersen was called on to bowl 16 overs in the match and took 4 wickets with his part-time off-breaks and Swann was immediately recalled to the side. England lost the three-Test series 2‚Äì0, and South Africa took over as the No. 1 ranked Test team. Swann finished with 4 wickets (as many as Pietersen in one match) at an average of 77. Swann was rested for the final three matches of the five game ODI series against South Africa which followed due to a problem with his elbow and was replaced in the team by Kent spinner James Tredwell had previously filled in for Swann in ODIs when the latter was unavailable or rested. In September and October, Sri Lanka hosted the 2012 ICC World Twenty20. England were the defending champions but were knocked out in the Super 8 stage after losing three out of their five matches. Swann played in all five matches, managing seven wickets and was the team's joint second-highest wicket-take behind fast bowler Steven Finn. A recurrence of an old elbow injury prevented Swann from joining England on the tour of New Zealand in March 2013. Panesar took his place as lead spinner in the side, but managed just 5 wickets costing 70 runs each as England drew the three-Test series 0‚Äì0. After undergoing surgery on his elbow, Swann was fit enough to return to the side when New Zealand toured England in May and June 2013. On 21 December 2013, Swann announced his retirement from all cricket with immediate effect. At this point, England were 3‚Äì0 down in the Ashes 2013-14 series. Bowling style Swann is noted for being an attacking spinner, generally delivering the ball with plenty of flight and bounce. He is also capable of subtle changes of pace. Unlike many contemporary off-spinners he does not bowl the doosra. Instead, his variations include a well-developed arm ball, and also a flatspinner/slider delivery that he has nicknamed his \\"flying saucer ball\\" that rotates around its vertical axis and generally bounces straight on. Swann also noted that he has a very different grip to the textbook grip of simply resting the tip of the index and middle fingers on the seam. He jams the seam as far as their second knuckles and almost coming out like a googly on the back of the hand on release. Because of this, he can spread the two fingers very wide apart. Commentator Peter Roebuck suggested in March 2010 that Swann's success has been due as much to his attitude as skill: Strictly Come Dancing From 8 September 2018 Swann participated in the sixteenth series of Strictly Come Dancing with professional dance partner Oti Mabuse. Personal life Swann married his wife Sarah on 29 January 2010. They live in Nottingham with their three children, Wilfred (born 17 February 2011), Charlotte (born 18 October 2012) and Jessica (born 2016). He also has an interest in football and revealed on the BBC's Football Focus that he supports Newcastle United and Blyth Spartans. He is the lead singer of the rock band Dr Comfort and the Lurid Revelations which plays cover songs in gigs around Nottinghamshire. On 2 April 2010 he was stopped by police in West Bridgford, Nottingham following a party and was arrested after providing a positive breath test. He was charged in June, to appear in court in August, and initially told court that he was on his way to purchase screwdrivers in order to rescue his cat from under the floorboards. Due to his cricketing commitments, the trial had several adjournments before he was cleared in February 2011, on the grounds that the blood sample could not be used as evidence. Swann became a summariser for the BBC's Test Match Special in February 2014.

Always on the Left and always unconventional (\\"I belong to the non-existent party of poets\\"), he is the author of a single novel (To kivotio - Mission Box) which is widely considered to be among the classic modern Greek works in the second half of the 20th century. Life Alexandrou was born in LeningradEKEBI.gr to a Greek father (Vasilis Vasiliadis) and a Russian mother (Polina Antovna Vilgelmson). Aristotle Vasiliadis (who at that time had yet not adopted the name Aris Alexandrou) and his parents moved to Greece in 1928, initially residing in Thessaloniki and shortly thereafter in Athens. He graduated from highschool in 1940, taking the university entrance exam at the engineering school (following his father's wishes) and failing. After that, he was admitted to the Athens University of Economics and Business. In 1942 he decided to drop out of the university and devote himself to work as a translator. At the same time, he joined a small resistance group (this was the time of the Nazi occupation of Greece). This small group was integrated in the communist youth resistance movement; Alexandrou was not able to cope with the hierarchical organization of the communist party and therefore left the party a few months later. The fact that he was no longer actively involved in the Party did not stop the British authorities (after the liberation of Greece and their installation there as a de facto ruler) from arresting him and sending to the El Tampa camp, wherein he remained up to April 1945. Furthermore, even though he did not participate in the ensuing Greek Civil War (1946-1949) he was arrested due to his refusal to disavow his political beliefs. From July 1948 up to October 1951 he was exiled to the camps of Moudros, Makronisos and Agios Efstratios. In November 1952 he was court-martialled for draft-dodging (while he was in exile). The initial verdict was 10 years in prison; Alexandrou did time in the prisons of Averof, Aighina and Gyaros. The review board reduced his sentence down to 7 years, and he was finally discharged in August 1958. After being discharged from prison he married Kaiti Drosou. In 1967 (after the junta of April 21) they decided to move to Paris to avoid possible new arrests. Alexandrou died in Paris on July 2, 1979, from a heart attack, having lived to see his only novel published in French translation. Poetry, prose and translations Many of Alexandrou's poems were written while he was in exile, and focus on socialism, writing, as well as more personal issues. Mayakovsky's influence is strong and made explicit. His only novel (Mission Box) is about the Greek civil war, ostensibly still going on in September 1949. However the locations mentioned are fictitious. The setting is the following: A team of soldiers on the communist side (which was fighting against the government side) had to carry out an all-important operation: to transport a mission box from one city to another. The mission goes haywire, and at the end the narrator (who was a member of this team) is arrested (not knowing by whom, but initially assuming that it was by \\"his\\" side). The book is made up of the \\"apology\\" that he writes out on a daily basis on the sheets of paper that his captors provide him with. Mission Box is also very interesting for its elaborate prose. The last chapter is a 45-page long sentence (and actually a question since it ends with a question mark) reminiscent of the final chapter of Ulysses. Most of Alexandrou's translations are from the Russian: this was how Alexandrou made ends meet throughout most of his life. His translations consisted mainly of prose writings (Dostoyevsky, Gorky, Ehrenburg among many others) but he also translated poems (for example Mayakovsky, Akhmatova).

Further success was limited and there were no other Illegal Records/I.R.S. releases for Wazmo Nariz. Wazmo Nariz's next recording was the Big Records release Tell Me How To Live.Wazmo Nariz at Trouser Press. The album cover was designed by Rick Landerman, who also designed logos and posters for him. Again, success was limited and five years went by before another recording was released, this time a 12\\" single \\"Yahoo Eeeee\\".

In keeping with Wazmo's quirky reputation, the album cover for \\"Things Aren't Right\\" (displayed on the show) has a cover photo that is slightly off- center. Nariz's trademark was his tendency to wear two neckties side by side. Wazmo has worked with Stan Ridgway under his real name, Larry Grennan, along with his drummer Bruce Zelesnik. Zelesnik performed as a permanent member of Stan's band starting in 2002.

It was previously called called the Kuparisaaren j√§√§halli (Copper Island Ice Rink) and locals often use the old name in conversation. The arena first opened in 1971 and has undergone renovation and expansion several times. It is located approximately three kilometres (roughly two miles) south-east of downtown Vaasa. Use The arena is principally used for ice hockey and serves as home ice to premier-level teams Vaasan Sport of the Liiga and Vaasan Sport Naiset of the Naisten Liiga, as well as Korsholm-Mustasaari Hockey Team (KoMu HT) which plays in the fourth-tier II Divisioona. Vaasa Arena features four ice surfaces, making it the only four-rink arena in Finland. The main arena has a seating capacity of 3,957 for hockey games and is used for all of Vaasan Sport‚Äôs home games. The three other pads of ice serve as training rinks, hosting most of the games for Vaasan Sport Naiset, KoMu HT, and other teams and junior organizations, but there is limited area for spectators. The training rink facilities are also made available to the public on a regular schedule. In addition, the figure skating club Vaasan Luistinkerho (VLK, ) and the synchronized skating club Wasa Team Skaters use the facilities at Vaasa Arena. The arena facilities are also used for rink bandy, curling, and various ball sports. The main arena is used for exhibitions and concerts.

Two days later, on 19 December 2017, the Vaasa City Council approved a budget for the renovation of Vaasa Arena, including the replacement of the main arena‚Äôs wood-arch roof structure. A total of eight million Euros over three years was allocated for the project, with he city of Vaasa contributing half of the project costs and Mustasaari contributing just under 25%. Building permits for the project were approved in June 2018. Renovations broke ground in April 2020, with the deconstruction of the main arena's old roof structure to make way for the construction of a new metal-trussed roof. Other elements include a new restaurant area, totally new outer walls on three sides, and an increase of the maximum capacity to approximately 5,000 for ice hockey events. Renovations were scheduled to be completed by 30 September 2020, but the project was slightly delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the arena construction completion date was pushed to October 2020. Prior to the pandemic, the first Liiga match in the updated building was set to be played on 10 October 2020.

He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm off-spin bowler. He played for Durham County Cricket Club up until his retirement. Smith originally played for Harrold CC and Bedford School (where he captained England opening batsman Alastair Cook). He played minor county cricket for Bedfordshire as a schoolboy, until he moved to Nottinghamshire in 2002. Primarily an opening batsman, at times Smith has been played slightly further down the order, especially during the Twenty20 cup. Smith is an exciting fielder and has taken some great catches (Twenty 20 Cup Finals day vs Surrey) and has fielded as 12th Man for the full England side whilst at Trent Bridge. Though having played three times during Nottinghamshire's 2005 title-winning season, he was unable to establish himself within the Championship team, and subsequently joined Durham County Cricket Club, thus returning to his University town: Smith is a graduate of Durham University, where he successfully captained Durham UCCE and gained a 2:1 (Hons) in Biochemistry. During the course of the 2008 season, Smith has established himself in the Durham championship side, primarily batting at No 3, and recently recorded his maiden 1st class double-hundred (201 not out) against Surrey, sending Durham to the top of the County Champion Division 1 as a result. Durham went on to win the County Championship for the first time in their history, and Smith's runs saw him named 2008 Player of the Year ahead of more recognisable names such as Shiv Chanderpaul and Steven Harmison. Smith was appointed as the new captain of Durham on 14 November 2008, succeeding Dale Benkenstein. Durham County Cricket Club continued their success in 2009, with Smith leading them to a successful defence of their County Championship Title in his first year in charge. Away from the playing side, Smith is a keen journalist and writes for All-Out Cricket as well as ad-hoc commentary for Sky and the BBC, he also enjoys watching Football and supports non league side Rushden & Diamonds.

Its title () means \\"The Beautiful Troublemaker\\". Loosely adapted from the short story \\"Le Chef-d'≈ìuvre inconnu\\" (The Unknown Masterpiece) by Honor√© de Balzac,Apparently, it also includes elements from the short stories \\"The Liar\\" and \\"The Figure in the Carpet\\", and the novella The Aspern Papers by Henry James. and set in present-day France, it tells how a famous old artist is stimulated to come out of retirement and do one last painting of a beautiful young woman. The film won the Grand Prix at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival. Plot A young would-be artist Nicolas, with his partner Marianne, are introduced by the art dealer Porbus to the aged painter Frenhofer, inactive for many years, who lives in a grand ch√¢teau in the south of France with his young wife Liz. Conversations are desultory, until Nicolas suggests that Frenhofer might like to paint the attractive Marianne. She is excited at the chance to be immortalised by a master, while he thinks she may be what he needs to complete his last piece, abandoned ten years ago when Liz was his model. Work starts early next morning in Frenhofer's isolated studio, consisting of continual pen and wash studies on paper of Marianne in different positions, as he tries to capture the uniqueness of her body and the character of the woman within it. Over long days together their relationship varies, sometimes staying distant and sometimes getting relaxed. He progresses to working in oils on canvas, one day overpainting an unfinished study of Liz. When she sneaks into the studio one night and sees it, she is furious and hurt at the symbolism. As the object of Frenhofer's concentrated attention all day, mostly in silence, Marianne has time to rethink her relationship with Nicolas and decides she no longer needs him. Eventually Frenhofer finishes his picture, which the film audience never sees. Once complete, the image is too powerful for Liz and for Marianne. Frenhofer hides it in a recess, which he seals with bricks and mortar, and quickly paints an innocuous version in which the face of the model is unseen. Porbus is invited to a celebratory party, after which Nicolas and the changed Marianne go their separate ways.

Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert added the film to his Great Movies collection in April 2009. The film holds an approval rating of 100% on review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes based on 29 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.08/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"A sensual and hypnotic masterpiece, La Belle Noiseuse luxuriates in its four-hour run time while holding audience attention\\".

Brought up in Loftus, Redcar and Cleveland,[Yorkshire Evening Post : Football guru to promote Yorkshire tourism] he moved to Leeds to study at the age of eighteen. It was there that he started his teaching career in a primary school. He began training the children of the school using techniques derived from Brazilian football. He soon began an after school club that would become the first of a now worldwide chain of soccer schools. In 1997, he borrowed ¬£5000 from a teachers' union to fund a trip to Brazil, where he spoke with Zico and Rivelino, and watched them coach. Having developed a close friendship with Brazil midfielder Juninho, Clifford used the knowledge he had learned and his own initiative to create a syllabus.  Coaching career  Once back in England, Clifford blended his academic knowledge of coaching and his experience as a teacher to develop his own coaching programme. In 1998, he started a Brazilian-style soccer school for youngsters in Leeds, teaching Brazilian skills as well as introducing his students to futebol de sal√£o, unheard of in England at the time. Clifford then set out to train his first batch of young footballers with his new methods, with a notably different philosophy, preferring to concentrate on improving ball skills and close control and an even greater emphasis on fitness and physical strength. He has since expanded his \\"Brazilian Soccer Schools\\" school franchise to other regions and countries, even expanding overseas to the likes of Hong Kong, Nigeria, South Africa, United States, Australia, the Netherlands, Thailand, Canada, Malaysia, Bermuda, Singapore, Mexico and Poland. Clifford is well regarded in the football industry; however, he failed to emerge onto the professional scene after being recruited by Sir Clive Woodward in December 2004, to become his assistant coach at Southampton. After falling out with the coaching establishment there, he returned to his own non-league club, Garforth Town, as manager. In 2003 Clifford purchased the Northern Counties East Football League First Division club Garforth Town. At the time of the purchase Clifford expressed the desire to take the club, then at the tenth level of the football pyramid, into the FA Premier League within twenty years. The club has made good progress, gaining two promotions during Clifford's two full seasons as manager. Clifford has managed to attract a number of his high-profile friends to play for the team including: Lee Sharpe, S√≥crates and Careca. The club now plays in the Unibond First Division North league. In April 2009, Clifford guided his team to the final of the West Riding County Cup to face Bradford Park Avenue. Heavy underdogs Garforth won 5‚Äì4 on penalties to claim the cup, a trophy which has been held by Leeds United among others. After three seasons of managing Garforth Town, Clifford made the decision to step aside as manager of his club. This was to focus and develop more quickly his SOCATOTS and Brazilian Soccer Schools programmes. In 2001 Clifford also introduced his pre-school coaching programme SOCATOTS, the first such programme in the world to teach basic ball skills, movement and co-ordination exercises to children from as young as six months old. The programme also teaches language, numeracy and colour identification and the children attend with their parents who are an integral part of the classes. This programme, like Clifford's Brazilian Soccer Schools is also a franchise and is running throughout the UK as well as internationally in places such as the Netherlands, Canada, Dubai, Poland and Singapore. He lauds Everton coach, Tosh Farrell as \\"light years ahead of anyone else within the academy system\\". Tosh said: \\"Our Under 7, Under 8, Under 9, Under 10 Academy players now use Futebol de Sal√£o in 75% of their training. Our U9‚Äôs who have used the ball for two years are one of the strongest age groups in the club\\". Brazilian Soccer Schools is now the largest football coaching organisation in the world, with over one million children regularly attending sessions around the globe. Players such as Micah Richards and John Bostock are the most successful graduates to date, though there are an estimated 1,700 youngsters working their way through the professional academy ranks. Over the last 12 years, Clifford has worked with Michael Owen, Wayne Rooney and Theo Walcott among others, and following his departure from Southampton, Cardiff City approached him with a view to appointing him in a similar role at Ninian Park. In September 2008, Clifford was approached by a South African consortium looking to purchase Newcastle United Football Club, with the party offering the 38-year-old a role as Academy Director as well as shares in the club. In the same month, he was also approached by Tottenham Hotspur midfielder David Bentley, with the England international asking Clifford to devise an elite training programme and to undertake one-to-one sessions with him. Work commitments, however, saw Clifford turn down the opportunity.  Noted graduates  The following noted players have all graduated from Simon Clifford's BSS system: * Micah Richards, Manchester City, England * John Farnworth, World Champion football freestyler  Other work  Clifford worked as Technical Coach for the two lead actresses of Bend It Like Beckham, Keira Knightley and Parminder Nagra. Clifford also performed the same role in the film There's Only One Jimmy Grimble with Robert Carlyle and Ray Winstone as well as the more recent Kicking and Screaming. He choreographed and advised on the film The Damned United. In November 2008, Clifford was approached by Setanta Sports with a view to him doing a regular blog for the company's website. His first, a critique of the state of the game from grassroots level up, was particularly damning of Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp, while subsequent articles have highlighted problems within the game. In May 2011, Clifford was made an official Yorkshire Patron for his work promoting the region around the world.

History Before the emergence of states which could bear the high costs of maintaining national policing and impartial court systems, local communities operated self-help systems to keep the peace and to enforce contracts. Until the thirteenth century, one of the institutions that emerged was an involuntary collective responsibility for the actions committed by one of the group. This was formalised into the community responsibility system (CRS) which was enforced by a fear of loss of community reputation and of retaliation by the injured community if the appropriate compensation was not paid. In some countries where the political system supported it, collective responsibility was gradually phased out in favour of individual responsibility. In Germany and Italy, collective systems were in operation as late as the sixteenth century. While communities were relatively small and homogeneous, CRS could work well, but as populations increased and merchants began to trade across ever wider territories, the system failed to match the emerging societies' needs for more personal accountability and responsibility. In England, Henry I allowed London to opt out of the CRS and to appoint a sheriff and justices in 1133, and between 1225 and 1232, Henry III assured the merchants of Ypres that none of them \\"will be detained in England nor will they be partitions for another's debts\\".Greif Nevertheless, the idea of imposing liability on another despite a lack of culpability never really disappeared and courts have developed the principle that an employer can incur liability for the acts and omissions of an employee if committed by the employee in the course of employment and if the employer has the right to control the way in which the employee carries out his or her duties (respondeat superior). The imposition of vicarious liability in these circumstances has been justified on the following grounds: *Exercise of control: If penalties are serious enough, it is assumed that rational employers will take steps to ensure that employees avoid injuring third parties. On the other hand, rational employers may choose to rely on independent contractors for risky operations and processes. *Risk spreading: Many consider it socially preferable to impose the cost of an action on a person connected to it, even if a degree removed, rather than on the person who suffered injury or loss. This principle is also sometimes known as the \\"deep pocket\\" justification. *Internalizing the social costs of activities: The employer usually (though not always) passes on the cost of compensating injury or loss to the customers and clients. As a result, the private cost of the product or service will better reflect its social cost. These justifications may work against one another. For example, insurance will increase the ability to do risk spreading, but will reduce incentives for the exercise of control. Modern vicarious liability The general rule in criminal law is that there is no vicarious liability. This reflects the general principle that crime is composed of both an actus reus (the Latin tag for \\"guilty act\\") and a mens rea (the Latin tag for \\"guilty mind\\") and that a person should only be convicted if they are directly responsible for causing both elements to occur at the same time (see concurrence). Thus, the practice of holding one person liable for the actions of another is the exception and not the rule in criminal law. Vicarious liability in English law The primary exception arises through statutory interpretation where the verb used to define the action in the actus reus is both the physical action of the employee and the legal action of the employer. For example, the activity of \\"driving\\" is purely a physical activity performed by the person behind the wheel. But when a cashier takes money as payment for goods, this is only the physical activity of selling. For goods to be sold, the owner of the goods must pass legal title to those goods. In default, the customer would commit the actus reus of theft. So the owner sells the goods at the same time that the employee takes the money. Similarly, only the holder of rights can grant a licence to another or permit another to do something that would otherwise have been unlawful. The verbs \\"possess\\", \\"control\\" and use may also have dual relevance depending on the context. Many of these are strict liability or regulatory offences, but the principle has been used to impose liability on a wide range of activities undertaken in a business or commercial environment. Vicarious liability in the United States This is generally applied to crimes that do not require criminal intent, e.g., those that affect the public welfare but which do not require the imposition of a prison term. The principle is that in such cases, the public interest is more important than private interest, and so the vicarious liability is imposed to deter or to create incentives for employers to impose stricter rules and supervise more closely. In Commonwealth v. Koczwara,155 A.2d 825 (1959) the defendant was the licensed operator of a tavern which was found to have supplied minors with alcohol. The offence became one of strict or absolute liability when applied vicariously because of the need to protect weak and vulnerable members of society, and the omission of words such as \\"knowingly\\", \\"willfully\\" or \\"intentionally\\" in some of the offences indicated a legislative intent to permit this eventuality. In Staples v United States,511 US 600 (1994) the defendant was initially convicted of being in possession of an unregistered machine gun. It was a rifle that had been modified for rapid fire, thereby putting it in violation of the National Firearms Act. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded the case. The majority held that the defendant needed actual knowledge about the nature of his weapon in order for him to be convicted. The dissenting opinion states that it was irrelevant that he did not know about the modification because statutes regulating dangerous weapons are public welfare statutes and can be interpreted to exclude the mens rea requirement of knowledge. Hence, as long as defendants know that they are dealing with a dangerous product or device that places them in a responsible relationship to the public, they should recognize that strict regulations are more likely and assume that the United States Congress would intend to place the burden on the defendant to ascertain at his peril whether his conduct comes within the inhibition of the statute. The courts generally convict employers for the illegal conduct of their employees even though the employers had no knowledge and so were not at fault. But in State v. Guminga395 NW2d 344 (Minn. 1986) 337 where a waitress served alcohol to a minor, the court found that the conviction of her employer violated the Due Process Clause and so was not constitutional under Minnesota law. Consequently, the defendant should only be given civil not criminal penalties. It is noted that this prohibition had been in force since 1905, which had given the legislature many years in which to reform the law. The majority rejected the argument of implied legislative intent. The issue of constitutionality in the form of a substantive due process clause requires a balancing of public interests and personal liberty. Although a statute making employers vicariously liable for their employee‚Äôs actions may serve the public interest by providing deterrence, the private interests affected (i.e. liberty, damaged reputation, etc.) outweigh the public interests, especially when there are alternative means to reach the same end of deterrence, say by civil fines or license suspension.

BBC Sport reported him as one of the greatest centers in NFL history. Langer was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1987. He is one of only five Dolphins players to get elected to the Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility; the others being Dan Marino, Don Shula, Paul Warfield, and Jason Taylor. College career Langer was a native of Little Falls, Minnesota. He spent his early life at Royalton and graduated from the Royalton High School in 1966. He played middle linebacker at South Dakota State University, where in 1969 he was Honorable Mention All-America. He also played on the team's offensive line, alternating between the tackle and guard positions. Langer also excelled as baseball, making a second-team All-America selection as an outfielder in his junior season. He led the team in hitting, field and pitching as the Jacks won a share of the North Central Conference title.https://state.sdstateconnect.org/remembering-jim-langer/ After graduating South Dakota State University with a B.S. in economics, he was signed by the Cleveland Browns as a free agent in 1970, but was cut during training camp. Langer signed as a free agent with the Miami Dolphins and saw limited action for his first 2 seasons. Professional career=Miami Dolphins Langer became the starter at center in the 1972 season. Between 1970 and 1979, he played 128 consecutive games for the Dolphins. Among these games were the 1972 and 1973 Super Bowl victories. In 1972, during the Super Bowl VII he played every offensive snap. The Dolphins win-loss figure in the season was 17-0 when it won the Super Bowl VII. Dolphins were the only unbeaten, untied team in the history of league. In 1973, during the Super Bowl VIII, the Dolphins again became the champions after they defeated the Vikings 24-7. Langer played a decisive role in the game where the ball was run 53 times for 196 yards by the Dolphins. During a 6-year stretch in the mid-1970s, Langer was named AP First-team All-Pro 3 times 1974, 1975, and 1977, and Second-team Team All-Pro thrice, in 1973, 1976, and 1978. He also appeared in the Pro Bowl each of those seasons. Langer played in three Super Bowls with the Dolphins, losing in Super Bowl VI, but winning in Super Bowl VII and Super Bowl VIII. In 1975, he was voted as the Dolphins' most valuable player while serving as an offensive lineman. He played ten seasons with the Dolphins. A knee injury ended his playing days with Miami nine games into the 1979 season with seven games still left. Minnesota Vikings Langer wanted to stay closer to his home, and accordingly asked to be traded to the Vikings in 1980. He was traded to the Minnesota Vikings prior to the 1980 season, playing his final 2 NFL seasons with the Minnesota Vikings before retiring after the 1981 campaign. He played 22 games as a Viking player from his overall 151 games. He also made one of his total 110 starts with the Vikings. His final participation in the NFL was in 1981. By this time, Langer was a six-time Pro Bowler, four-time first-team All-Pro and two-time Super Bowl champion. Post NFL career Around the middle of the decade of 1980s, he worked in the WJON AM 1240 radio station as a broadcaster. He handled the color commentator duties for the football broadcasts of St. Cloud State University Huskies. Langer was inducted to the Dolphins Honor Roll and in the Dolphins Walk of Fame. The Jim Langer Award is presented to the nation's top NCAA Division II lineman each year in his honor. In 2016, the football field of Royalton High School was named after Langer. Out of the 97 high school football fields in America, it was the only field that was an NFL Hometown Hall of Fame field. Personal life He lived in Ramsey, Minnesota, had married Linda and had four children. In 2013, President Barack Obama honored the entire 1972 Perfect Season Dolphins at an event in the White House, but Langer declined to attend for political reasons. He told sports columnist Dave Hyde of Ft. Lauderdale's Sun-Sentinel \\"We've got some real moral compass issues in Washington... I don't want to be in a room with those people and pretend I'm having a good time. I can't do that. If that [angers] people, so be it.\\" According to his wife Linda, Langer died on August 29, 2019 at a hospital near his home in Coon Rapids, Minnesota because of a sudden heart-related issue. To honor his contributions, the Hall of Fame flag was flown at half-staff in Canton, Ohio. Langer's death made him the third player from the 1972 Dolphins team to die in 2019, along with Bob Kuechenberg and Nick Buoniconti.

However, Microsoft's Office for Mac and most other document applications on the platform do not support RTFD.  Microsoft Windows  In contrast to RTF, RTFD files cannot be opened properly by applications on Windows, which does not support the concept of bundles. In Microsoft Windows, RTFD files are displayed as folders. Editing these folders may destroy the data inside the RTFD. In particular editing any of the elements, such as the text file, inside the folder will remove other elements, such as graphics. Any text associated with the RTFD file appears in the Windows folder as an RTF file.

Akoustolith was a patented product of a collaboration between Rafael Guastavino Jr. and Harvard professor Wallace Sabine over a period of years starting in 1911.It was used to limit acoustic reflection and noise in large vaulted ceilings.William J. Cavanaugh, Gregory C. Tocci, Joseph A. Wilkes, Architectural Acoustics: Principles and Practice, Hoboken: John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 2010. 71. Akoustolith was bonded as an additional layer to the structural tile of the Tile Arch System ceilings built by the Rafael Guastavino Company of New Jersey. The most prevalent use was to aid speech intelligibility in cathedrals and churches prior to the widespread use of public address systems. History Akoustolith was first introduced by the Guastavino Fireproof Construction Company, in collaboration with Wallace Sabine of Harvard University, in 1915. The founder of the Guastavino Company, Rafael Guastavino Sr., had immigrated to the United States from Spain in 1881, bringing with him the method of timbrel-vault construction, also known as cohesive construction. The Raphael Guastavino Company's vaulting technique created monolithic assemblies by layering thin bricks and structural tiles with fast-drying mortar. The Guastavino Technique, as it came to be known, consisted of multiple layers of plaster and tile in the construction of masonry vaulting; the first course of tile was set in its position with quick setting mortar creating form-work for the subsequent layers. Tiles were placed in concentric circles in the construction of domes, while in ribbed vaults, ribs served as the general form-work. Upon Guastavino Sr.'s death in 1908, his son, Rafael Guastavino Jr. took over the Guastavino Fireproof Construction Company; he was largely responsible for the company's development of acoustical finishes, including the incorporation and development of Rumford and Akoustolith tiles. Raphael Guastavino Jr. and Wallace Sabine patented Akoustolith in 1916, to be used as a facing for Guastavino's timbrel vaults. The two had previously collaborated in the development of the Rumford tile, a ceramic acoustical finish used in the construction of the St. Thomas Church in New York City. While initially a success, the cost to manufacture Rumford tile led the company to focus on the development of the cheaper and more durable Akoustolith. As a non-ceramic tile, the sound absorption properties produced by Akoustolith's rough and porous surface, was an improvement on the Rumford tile . With the exception of the replacement of the first layer of tiles with the sound-absorbing Akoustolith, the Guastavino method of construction was unaltered. The effectiveness of Akoustolith in the reduction of reverberation led to its use in the construction of ecclesiastical spaces. Following Sabine's death in 1919, Guastavino continued to patent acoustical building products. The Guastavino Fireproof Construction Company remained in business until 1962, its decline is attributed to the increased cost of hand labor in conjunction with the rise of concrete-shell construction. As timbrel-vault construction waned, the installation and production of acoustical materials helped sustain the company. By the late 1920s and early 1930s a considerable portion of the firm's business was related to these products. However, as other corporation began to mass-produce less-expensive acoustical building materials, Guastavino products ceased to be competitive. Composition and Properties Akoustolith developed as an improvement on the earlier Rumford tile. Rumford tiles had previously been made with rich organic soil that burned off during the firing process and created pores, this procedure was ultimately irregular and difficult to control. Consequently, Akoustolith was produced by binding well-sorted pumice particles with Portland cement to create an artificial stone, a process which offered consistency and allowed for a variety of shapes and color. Although sand and Portland Cement were typically used in the production of Akoustolith, the tile patent states that crushed rock or brick could be used as the aggregate, while lime or Plaster of Paris could be used as the binding material. Akoustolith's efficiency in absorbing different pitches was largely dependent upon the dimensions of its particles; its most imperative feature was its use of aggregate graded to a uniform size. Finer grades of aggregate were sieved out, leaving spaces between the particles, creating an intercommunicating pore structure that absorbed sound. According to Guastavino's and Sabine's 1916 patent Akoustolith absorbed \\"much in excess of 15% of sounds in the pitch between the middle C and the third octave above the middle C, which are the characteristic sounds which distinguish articulate speech.\\"U.S. Patent no. 1,197,956, \\"Sound Absorbing Materials for Walls and Ceilings,\\" issued September 12, 1916, p.2, lines 26-30 Designed with a graded porosity to increase their range of absorption, the stone-like finish of Akoustolith tiles consisted of a mix of coarser aggregate to facilitate the absorption of low pitches. Similarly, the bedding face consisted of a mix of finer aggregate to absorb higher pitches. Eventually, different grades of the material were sold; these varied in size and sound-absorption coefficients. Building with Akoustolith Although the production of Akoustolith tile was short-lived, its effectiveness in reducing reverberation in ecclesiastical spaces led to its installation in a variety of building types, including commercial, industrial, and institutional structures. The acoustical and fireproof nature of Akoustolith was advertised, and to a lesser degree, its ability to resist the condensation of moisture. In addition, Akoustolith's aesthetic qualities were touted: the tiles were available in several shades of gray and buff intended to blend with the warm colors of adjacent stone. Resembling a stone-like masonry material, Akoustolith tile was incorporated into several of the Guastavino Company's major building projects, including the 1929 construction of the Buffalo Central Terminal. Completed in the late 1920s, Fellheimer & Wagner's Buffalo Central Terminal was the largest installation of Akoustolith completed by the Guastavino Company. List of Example Projects Fellheimer & Wagner's design of the Buffalo Central Terminal, in New York, was the largest installation of Akoustolith completed by the Guastavino Company. New York architect Bertram Goodhue specified the use of the Guastavino tile in his 1920 design for the Nebraska Capitol. Consequently, the Nebraska Capitol features tiled vaults and domes, and meeting rooms constructed with Akoustolith tiles. Ralph Adams Cram's 1921 design for the Princeton University Chapel employs the Guastavino Company's Akoustolith tile vaulting.

Renowned for his toughness, marksmanship, and investigative skill, he acquired status in the Southwest as the archetypal Texas Ranger. Hamer also led the fight in Texas against the Ku Klux Klan, starting in 1922, as senior captain of the Texas Rangers, and he is believed to have saved at least 15 people from lynch mobs. He was inducted into the Texas Ranger Hall of Fame. His professional record and reputation are not without controversy, particularly with regard to his willingness to use deadly force even in an increasingly modernized society. Hamer has been described by biographer John Boessenecker as \\"one of the greatest American lawmen of the twentieth century\\". Early years Frank Hamer was born in 1884 in Fairview, Wilson County, Texas, where his father operated a blacksmith shop. Growing up in a devoutly Presbyterian family, he was one of five sons, four of whom became Texas Rangers. He grew up on the Welch ranch in San Saba County, and later spent time in Oxford, Llano County, which is now a ghost town; he later joked about being the only \\"Oxford- educated Ranger\\". Although his formal education ended after the sixth grade, as a youth he displayed several unusual abilities, including an extremely high level of intelligence and a near-photographic memory.Boessenecker, p. 9 He excelled at mathematics and developed a deep interest in history, particularly that of the Texas Rangers and the region's Native American tribes, such as the Comanche, Kiowa, and Kiowa Apache.Boessenecker, pp. 9-11 He worked in his father's shop as a youth, and as a wrangler on a local ranch. Hamer began his career in law enforcement in 1905 while working on the Carr Ranch in West Texas when he captured a horse thief. The local sheriff was so impressed that he recommended that Hamer join the Rangers, which he did the following year. He was at home on the open Texas prairie and understood the signs and patterns of nature. He interpreted men in terms of animal characteristics: \\"The criminal is a coyote, always taking a look over his shoulder.\\"Webb, p. 522. Law enforcement career Hamer was a Ranger off and on throughout his adult life, resigning often to take other jobs. He joined Captain John H. Rogers' Company C in Alpine, Texas, on April 21, 1906, and began patrolling the Mexican border. In 1908, he resigned from the Rangers to become the City Marshal of Navasota, Texas, a lawless boom-town wracked by violence; \\"shootouts on the main street were so frequent that in two years at least a hundred men died.\\"Caro, p. 326. Hamer moved in at age 24 and enforced law and order.Sitton, p. 28. In 1911, he moved to Houston to work as a special investigator, where he was seconded to the Sheriff's Office of Harris County. In 1914, he was hired as a deputy sheriff in Kimble County, assigned as the department's livestock theft investigator. Hamer rejoined the Rangers in 1915 and was assigned to patrol the South Texas border around Brownsville. The Rangers dealt with arms smugglers because of the constant unrest in Mexico during the Mexican Revolution. They also tried to control the bootleggers during the Prohibition era and bandits who plagued the border. He left the Rangers again to become a range detective for the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association, commissioned as a Special Ranger. In 1917, Hamer married Gladys (Johnson) Sims, the widow of Ed Sims of Snyder, Texas; she and her brother had been charged in 1916 with murdering Sims. Hamer and Gladys and other family members were stopped at a garage on October 1, 1917 to get gasoline in Sweetwater when they suddenly encountered Gus McMeans of Odessa, Ed Sims' brother-in-law, and the Hamers and McMeans got into a pistol battle. McMeans was a former Texas Ranger and sheriff of Ector County, and he and Hamer \\"were clinched\\"; McMeans died of a shot to the heart and Hamer was wounded. Ten shots were fired in the gunfight, and police collected a total of seven revolvers, two semi-automatic pistols, and three rifles from the two parties. Following this, Hamer left the Cattlemen's Association to accept a position as a federal agent in the Prohibition Unit, where he served for about one year. His service was brief but eventful while stationed in El Paso, the scene of countless gunfights during the Prohibition era. He participated in numerous raids and shootouts, and he was involved in a gun battle with smugglers on March 21 which resulted in the death of Prohibition Agent Ernest W. Walker.Dolan, Samuel K. Cowboys and Gangsters: Stories of an Untamed Southwest (TwoDot Books, 2016) Hamer transferred to Austin in 1921 where he served as Senior Ranger Captain. In 1918, Hamer physically threatened State Representative Jos√© Tom√°s Canales, who was leading an investigation into Texas Rangers accused of abusing residents of the Rio Grande Valley. Canales reported the threat to the governor, but Hamer was not disciplined. He stalked Canales in the capital, and Samuel Ealy Johnson Jr., father of future President Lyndon B. Johnson, was among those who escorted Canales to the early 1919 hearings. Beginning in 1922 Hamer led the fight in Texas against the Ku Klux Klan as senior captain of the Texas Rangers, which was still growing in Texas, and he saved 15 people from lynch mobs throughout his career.John Boessenecker, Texas Ranger: the Epic Life of Frank Hamer, the Man Who Killed Bonnie and Clyde, St. Martin's, 2016 A less successful incident happened during the Sherman Riot of 1930, however. Hamer and a handful of Rangers were charged with protecting the trial of a black rape suspect, George Hughes, in the town of Sherman. A large mob approached the courthouse, and Hamer personally shot and wounded two of the mob's members. However, the mob set fire to the courthouse. Hamer and the Rangers escaped the building, but did not bring Hughes with them or stay around to check on his condition; instead they got into a borrowed car and drove away from Sherman, abandoning the town. If Hughes had survived the fire, he did not survive the mob afterward, who used dynamite on the vault he'd been locked in and strung Hughes's dead body up. Sherman's black district was looted by the mob afterward, with the Rangers unwilling or unable to stop them. In 1928, Hamer put a halt to a murder for hire ring, and his extraordinary means of accomplishing this made him nationally famous. The Texas Bankers' Association had begun offering rewards of $5,000 \\"for dead bank robbers‚Äînot one cent for live ones.\\" Hamer determined that men were setting up deadbeats and two-bit outlaws to be killed by complicit police officers; the officers would collect the rewards and pay the men their finder's fees. But the police refused him support and the Bankers' Association's position was that \\"any man that could be induced to participate in a bank robbery ought to be killed.\\" Hamer wrote a detailed expos√© of the racket, which he termed \\"the bankers' murder machine\\", and he took his article to the press room of the State Capitol and handed out copies. His revelation about the racket resulted in public outrage, an investigation, and indictments.Webb, pp. 533‚Äì38. \\"Hamer Called in Robbery Inquiry\\", April 5, 1928. \\"Bonds on Murder Charge Forfeited\\", Nov. 12, 1928. Upton County News. Transcribed, Texas Genealogy Trails The bankers did not modify the terms of the reward, however, and more bounty murders took place in 1930.Phillips, pp. 254‚Äì55, n. 22. Hamer retired in 1932 after almost 27 years with the Rangers. He left one week before Miriam \\"Ma\\" Ferguson recaptured the governor's office for a second term. She had first been elected after her husband \\"Pa\\" Ferguson had been impeached and forced to resign as governor, and at least 40 Rangers resigned rather than serve again under her. A year later, Hamer gave his reason for retiring: \\"When they elected a woman governor, I quit.\\" The commander of the Texas Rangers allowed him to retain a Special Ranger commission as an active Senior Ranger Captain even after his official retirement. The special commission is listed in the state archives in Austin.Frank Hamer, Texas Ranger Warrant of Authority, 1931. Texas State Library & Archives Commission Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, known as \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\" in 1933 The posse. Top, L to R: Hinton, Oakley, Gault; seated, L to R: Alcorn, Jordan and Frank Hamer. In the early 1930s, Bonnie and Clyde's crime spree generated vast media coverage which embarrassed law enforcement and government officials in a half dozen states. On January 16, 1934, Barrow, Parker, and associate Jimmy Mullens raided Eastham prison farm, freeing Raymond Hamilton, Henry Methvin, Hilton Bybee, and Joe Palmer. Hamilton's brother Floyd wrote that Henry Methvin was not part of the original \\"invited\\" group but fled with them during the general confusion.Guinn, p. 410 n. 248. Barrow had particularly wanted to free Ralph Fults and Aubrey Skelley, but he considered the raid to be successful retaliation against the prison system. Historian John Neal Phillips says that \\"paying back\\" the Department of Corrections for abuse that Barrow had received while imprisoned motivated many of his actions and underlay his crime spree.Phillips. The Texas Department of Corrections received national negative publicity over the jailbreak, which delighted Barrow, who thought that he finally had his revenge. Two guards were shot by the escapees during the breakout, guard Major Crowson fatally. He died in the hospital on January 27 soon after Texas prison administrator Lee Simmons assured him that he would send his killer Joe Palmer to the electric chair. Simmons then turned his attention to restoring the reputation of the Texas prison system. =Hamer leads the hunt= Simmons persuaded Hamer to hunt down the Barrow Gang. Hamer was commissioned as an officer of the Texas Highway Patrol, then seconded to the prison system as a special investigator charged with apprehending Barrow and his colleagues.Simmons, chief of the Dept. of Corrections, wrote in his memoir that Hamer was one of two lawmen whom he had in mind. According to Ranger historian Ben Proctor, two former Ranger captains later said that Simmons had approached each of them first, and that they each turned him down for the identical reason: \\"We don't ambush people, and we don't kill women.\\" Guinn p. 410. Ralph Fults heard the story from one of the Rangers in 1948. Phillips, p. 354 n. 3. Hamer balked at the compensation of $180 a month, less than half his current pay,Guinn, p. 254. but Simmons reiterated that Hamer would collect his fair share of the reward money. He further added to the deal by authorizing Hamer to take whatever he wanted from among the Barrow Gang's possessions when he caught them. Simmons said that he wouldn't presume to tell Hamer how to do his job, but he suggested that Hamer \\"put 'em on the spot, know you're right‚Äîand shoot everybody in sight.\\"Parker; Simmons p. 128. Hamer examined the pattern of Barrow's movements, discovering that he essentially made a wide circle through the lower Midwest, skirting state borders wherever he could to take advantage of the fact that law officers could not pursue suspects across state lines. The circle's anchor points were Dallas, Joplin, Missouri, and northwest Louisiana, with wider arcs outward for bank robberies. Hamer felt that he learned Barrow's statistics, but \\"this was not enough. An officer must know the habits of the outlaw, how he thinks and how he will act in different situations. When I began to understand Clyde Barrow's mind, I felt that I was making progress.\\"Webb, p. 540. In the next couple of months, Barrow, Parker, and Henry Methvin robbed banks in Lancaster, Texas, Poteau, Oklahoma, and the Iowa towns of Rembrandt, Knierim, Stuart, and Everly.Ramsey. Hamer was always following close behind.Guinn, pp. 267‚Äì69. =Shootings propel public outrage= Hamer was tracking the Barrow gang's murders as well as the bank robberies. The gang had killed two Texas Highway Patrol officers at Grapevine, Texas on Easter Sunday, April 1, 1934 which inflamed public sentiment against Barrow and Parker. An eyewitness account gained widespread newspaper coverage, stating that a drunken Bonnie had emptied her gun into the prone body of Patrolman Murphy at Grapevine, laughing as she fired at the way that his \\"head bounced like a rubber ball\\" on the road.Guinn, p. 284. Another story stated that a cigar butt \\"bearing tiny teethmarks\\" was found in the gravel.Phillips, p. 351 n. 21. The lurid newspaper stories and the furor which they created increased the pressure on government and law enforcement to capture the criminals, and Governor Ferguson placed a $500 bounty on Bonnie for her alleged role in the murder of Patrolman Murphy.Guinn, p. 287, Knight p. 147. Popular opinion turned against the criminals even more five days later when Barrow and Methvin killed Constable Calvin Campbell, a 60-year-old single father, near Commerce, Oklahoma. They kidnapped Commerce Chief of Police Percy Boyd and drove him across the border into Kansas, where they released him. He posted their names at the top of the Campbell murder warrants, issued against Barrow, Parker, and John Doe (Methvin) later that week.Knight and Davis, p. 217, n. 12. =Focus shifts to Louisiana= In mid-March, Henry Methvin's family contacted Bienville Parish Sheriff Henderson Jordan about their son, his legal troubles, and his involvement with Barrow. Hamer was a lone wolf by nature, but he eventually formed an inter-jurisdictional posse and created a plan to ambush the gang. Sheriff Jordan and his deputy Prentiss Oakley, an excellent marksman, were the first to join the posse. Hamer brought in fellow former Ranger Maney Gault who had resigned from the Ranger force when \\"Ma\\" Ferguson was elected and now worked for the Texas Highway Patrol. Hamer asked Dallas County Sheriff Smoot Schmid to assign his deputy Bob Alcorn full-time to the case; Schmid sent Alcorn and Ted Hinton, another Dallas County deputy.Guinn, p. 288Hinton remembered Bonnie from the Dallas caf√© where she had waited tables four years before. Alcorn had picked up 16 year-old Clyde in West Dallas for stealing chickens, though he did not arrest him. The two deputies and Schmid had tried to ambush Bonnie and Clyde in late November 1933 near Sowers, Texas. They examined Barrow's abandoned V-8 Ford at Sowers and discovered that the bullets from his Thompson submachine gun had not penetrated its body, so this time Hinton requested a Browning automatic rifle.Cartledge, Rick. \\"The Guns of Frank Hamer.\\" The Sight's M1911 .45 ACP Page The road ended here for Bonnie and Clyde The lawmen confronted Bonnie and Clyde on a rural road near Gibsland, Louisiana at 9:15 a.m. on May 23, 1934, after 102 days tracking them. Barrow stopped his car at the ambush spot and the posse's 150-round fusillade was so thunderous that people for miles around thought a logging crew had used dynamite to fell a huge tree.Guinn, p. 341Dynamiting trees was illegal and logging crews were angered at the sound, thinking that someone was violating the ban. Accounts differ only slightly concerning the last moment before gunfire erupted: Sheriff Jordan said that he was calling out to Barrow to halt as the shooting started, Deputy Alcorn said that Captain Hamer was calling out, and Deputy Hinton wrote that Alcorn called out. All six, however, agreed that Deputy Oakley stood and fired the opening shot from his Remington Model 8, and that his bullet hit Barrow's left temple and killed the outlaw instantly.Guinn, p. 426Guinn bases his description of the ambush on Sandy Jones's exhaustive 1998 inquiry and forensic reenactment. The posse fired off another 100-plus rounds, any number of which would have been fatal to Parker and also to Barrow.Guinn, p. 340. Hamer used a customized .35 Remington Model 8 semiautomatic rifle with a 15-round magazine that he ordered from Petmeckey's Sporting Goods store in Austin, Texas. He was shipped serial number 10045; at least two Model 8s were used in the ambush.Herring, p. 224. The rifle was modified to accept a \\"police only\\" 20-round magazine obtained through the Peace Officers Equipment Company in St. Joseph, Missouri. State, local, and other sources had pledged money to the Barrow reward fund which brought the pre-ambush total to some $26,000, but most reneged on their pledges. Each posse member received a meager $200.23. They were allowed to take some of the goods and belongings of the gang; Hamer took most of the guns.Guinn, p. 352. Hamer had learned a great deal about the lives of Barrow and Parker in the preceding months, and he told reporters that, under other circumstances, he \\"would have gotten sick\\" to see a woman's perforated body in the car; as it was, he did not get sick because he remembered Parker's crimes. \\"I hated to shoot a woman‚Äîbut I remembered the way in which Bonnie had taken part in the murder of nine peace officers. I remembered how she kicked the body of the highway patrolman at Grapevine and fired a bullet into his body as he lay on the ground.\\", although it is possible he did not realize that said incident was reported in an alleged eyewitness report, rather than an official statement of her crimes. I'm Frank Hamer, Chapters 20‚Äì23. Methvin Online Hamer also said that he hated \\"to bust the cap on a woman, especially when she was sitting down, however if it wouldn't have been her, it would have been us.\\" Cox, p. 161. This, however, does not reflect the fact that she had been ambused by armed and ready Texas officers Hamer, Hinton, Alcorn, and B.M. \\"Maney\\" Gault, and Louisiana officers Henderson Jordan and Prentiss Morel Oakley. Later years During the 1930s, Hamer applied his civil peace- keeping skills to working on behalf of various oil companies and shippers, which were resisting unionization of their companies, and he often performed as a strike breaker. The first of these engagements was for the city of Houston during the 1935 Gulf Coast longshoremen's strike. Hamer headed a force of 20 ex-Rangers and sheriffs to prevent sabotage and looting. He was also active the following year during the 1936 Gulf Coast maritime workers' strike. At the outbreak of war in Europe in 1939, he and 49 other retired Texas Rangers offered their services to King George VI to help protect the United Kingdom in case of Nazi invasion. In September 1948, he was called back to Ranger duty to play a small role in the notorious 1948 United States Senate election in Texas.Olson, p. 252; Plantinga, p. 152; Wolff, Henry Jr., \\"Box 13 Is a Black Mark on Texas Politics.\\" The Victoria Advocate, November 8, 2000.Tolchin, Martin. \\"How Johnson Won Election He'd Lost.\\" The New York Times, Feb. 11, 1990. Former Governor Coke Stevenson hired him to accompany him to the Texas State Bank in Alice to examine the tally sheets for ballot box 13, which held ballots for his opponent Representative Lyndon Johnson which he knew to be fraudulent. Outside the bank stood two glowering groups of armed men. Hamer got out of the car, approached the first group, and said \\"git\\" and they left. The second group was blocking the doors of the bank, and he said \\"fall back\\" and they did.Dallek, pp. 332‚Äì34. Hamer retired in 1949 and lived in Austin until his death. Health and death In 1953, Frank Hamer suffered a stroke; he lived two more years but never regained his health.Milner, p. 158. He was buried near his son Billy in Memorial Park Cemetery in Austin. He was wounded 17 times during his life and left for dead four times. He is credited with having killed between 53 and 70Toland, p. 296. people. Popular culture In the 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde, Hamer is portrayed by Denver Pyle. He is depicted as incompetent, while the Barrow gang is shown capturing, teasing, and humiliating him. The ambush at the end of the film is suggested as his personal revenge. After the film's release, his widow Gladys and son Frank Jr. sued Warner Bros.-Seven Arts for defamation of character. In 1971, they received an undisclosed out-of-court settlement.Guinn, p. 364 Kevin Costner portrays Hamer in the 2019 Netflix original film The Highwaymen, which was released to theaters for a short run and began streaming in March 2019.

He is best known for his appearance in the 2005 film Murderball. Zupan was also a part of the 2008 United States gold winning team at the 2008 Beijing Paralympic Games.  Early life  Zupan was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to Thomas and Linda Zupan. He played varsity football and soccer at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL, earning him a scholarship to Florida Atlantic University. Paralyzing accident After a soccer game on October 14, 1993, Zupan got drunk with teammates at a bar and then crawled into the back of friend Chris Igoe's truck to sleep. Some time later Igoe left the bar unaware that Zupan was asleep in the back. Driving drunk, Igoe spun out and Zupan was thrown from the pickup bed, over a fence, and into a canal, where he held onto a branch for 14 hours until being discovered by a passerby.Troopers Overlook Man Hurt In Wreck, October 16, 1993, Miami Herald He went into hypothermia and became paraplegic as a result of the accident. Zupan has incomplete quadriplegia and is able to walk for short distances with crutches.Gimp: When Life Deals You a Crappy Hand, You Can Fold -or You Can Play -  Wheelchair rugby career  After his accident, Zupan graduated from Georgia Tech, became a two-time quad rugby national champion, the 2004 quad rugby player of the year. He was a member of the bronze medal-winning U.S. team at the 2004 Summer Paralympics, and the gold medal-winning team at the 2008 Games. He is a resident of Austin, Texas. When asked if he would \\"turn back the clock on that day\\", Zupan answered \\"No, I don't think so. My injury has led me to opportunities and experiences and friendships I would never have had before. And it has taught me about myself. In some ways, it's the best thing that ever happened to me.\\"  Media personality  Zupan was featured as a customer in TLC's Miami Ink during the first season. Parts of his documentary were shown as background information. He was depicted in an episode of the claymation series Celebrity Deathmatch in a match against Chris Pontius; he won. In August 2007, Zupan's team \\"Superman's Crip-Tonite\\" placed second in Red Bull Flugtag event in Austin, Texas. For their efforts they won a $3,000 prize. Zupan's Flugtag adventure was chronicled in an ESPN.com story by writer Mary Buckheit. He was also in the movie Jackass Number Two, in a skit called \\"Lake Jump\\", where his wheelchair was rigged up with carbon dioxide tanks and pushed off a ramp by Chris Pontius. Before taking off, the tanks triggered, launching him off of the ramp and into the lake. Zupan was featured in a 2008 episode of 30 Days in which former NFL athlete Ray Crockett used a wheelchair for 30 days and at one point attempted to play wheelchair rugby. In the second season of the television show Friday Night Lights, Zupan appeared briefly in the episode \\"Bad Ideas\\" as Steve, a friend who accompanies character Jason Street to a doctor appointment.

Archived from the original on March 14, 2012. also known as Busy Arnold, was an American publisher and an early comic-book entrepreneur whose company Quality Comics published during the 1930s and 1940s period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books. He was also instrumental in the publishing arrangement that led to Will Eisner's newspaper Sunday-supplement comics series The Spirit. Early life and career The Comics Magazine #1 (May 1936), one of the first comic books. Art by Vin Sullivan. Growing up in Rhode Island,. This source erroneously gives Arnold's birth year as 1890, possibly a typographical error. where his habit of talking in class earned him the admonishment \\"busybody\\" from teachers, and the subsequent nickname \\"Busy\\" from classmates, Everett M. Arnold graduated from Brown University with an economics degree in 1921, years later receiving the Brown Alumni Association's Brown Bear Award for service to his alma mater. He found work with the printing press manufacturer R. Hoe and Company, and later spent 12 years as the Eastern sales representative for New York City's Goss Printing Company.Steranko, p. 92 There he sold presses to Waterbury, Connecticut's Eastern Color Printing (future publisher of the first American comic book, Famous Funnies #1, May 1934), and to the McClure Syndicate in Baltimore, Maryland. Circa 1930, either Arnold persuaded Buffalo, New York printer Walter Koessler to invest in a color plant in order to print comics, or vice versa (sources differ). In either event, Arnold became vice president of Koessler's Greater Buffalo Press and learned publishing as the company began printing a large number of color comic newspaper sections. In 1936, Arnold gave either financial or other, unspecified help to the New York City-based Comics Magazine Company, founded by John Mahon and Bill Cook, former employees of Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson's National Allied Publications, the primary forerunner of DC Comics.Comics Magazine Company, 1936 - 1937 at the Grand Comics Database The duo published the premiere issue of The Comics Magazine (May 1936),Some references contend that its feature \\"Captain Bill of the Rangers\\" was comics' first Western, but more than a year earlier, Fun Comics #1 (Feb. 1935) had run the modern-West feature \\"Jack Woods\\" and the Old West feature \\"Buckskin Jim\\". using inventory content from National Allied's submissions. The original features (as opposed to color comic strip reprints, as Famous Funnies published) included the Doctor Occult spin-off Dr. Mystic the Occult Detective (unrelated to the Mr. Mystic that later ran in newspapers), by future Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. Other titles included Funny Pages, Funny Picture Stories, Detective Picture Stories and Keen Detective Funnies. Daniel R. Hanna Sr., publisher of Ohio's Cleveland News, printed the interiors, with Cleveland's Penton Press printing the covers and handling binding and shipping. But the company ‚Äî which would evolve into Centaur Publications ‚Äî would have no hit title. Quality and Connecticut Crack Comics #5 (Sept. 1940), first use of the \\"Quality Comic Group\\" logo (to right of \\"COMICS\\"). Cover art by Gill Fox. The enterprising Arnold, deducing that Depression-era audiences wanted established, familiar comic strips for their hard-earned dimes, rather than untried original material, formed the suitably titled Comic Favorites, Inc.Quality Comics : Comic Favorites, Inc. (Indicia Publisher) at the Grand Comics Database in collaboration with three newspaper syndicates: the McNaught Syndicate, the Frank J. Markey Syndicate, and Iowa's Register and Tribune Syndicate. Hiring cartoonist Rube Goldberg, who had just begun the strip Lala Palooza, and Goldberg's assistant, Johnny Devlin, Arnold in mid-1937 began publishing Feature Funnies, which mixed color reprints of leading comic strips (including Joe Palooka, Mickey Finn and Dixie Dugan) with a smattering of new features.Feature Funnies at the Grand Comics Database His first office was at 389 Lexington Avenue in Manhattan. The new material came from comics \\"packagers\\", small studios that sprang up to produce comics on demand for publishers looking to enter the emerging comic-book field. Initially, Arnold bought from the quirkily named Harry \\"A\\" Chesler shop and from Eisner & Iger, headed by Will Eisner and Jerry Iger. He recalled in an interview for a 1972 history of comics, Arnold began developing an in-house staff, with George Brenner, writer-artist of comic books' first masked adventurer‚Äîthe Comics Magazine Company's the Clock‚Äîamong his first employees. In 1939, Arnold and the owners of the Register & Tribune Syndicate's parent company, brothers John Cowles, Sr. and Gardner Cowles, Jr.'s Cowles Media Company, bought out the McNaught and Markey interests. Arnold became 50% owner of the newly formed Comic Magazines, Inc., the corporate entity that would publish the Quality Comics line. That year Quality released Smash Comics #1 (Aug. 1939), the company's first comic book with exclusively new material. By then, in February 1940, Arnold moved his offices from New York City to the Gurley Building in Stamford, Connecticut, with staffers by now including editor Ed Cronin, Gill Fox, Plastic Man creator Jack Cole, Tony DiPreta, and Zoltan Szenics. \\"Since it was a long round trip for [acclaimed artist] Lou Fine (who was partially crippled) to make each day,\\" Arnold said in the early 1970s, \\"I rented a studio for Lou in the Woodstock Tower in Tudor City, a large Manhattan high-rise complex\\". Quality Comics quickly grew to encompass such top-selling characters as Blackhawk, Doll Man, Plastic Man, Kid Eternity, and Uncle Sam, among others. The name Quality Comics debuted on the cover of Crack Comics #5 (Sept. 1940; see image above). \\"Seemingly never an official publishing title,\\" the Connecticut Historical Society noted, \\"the Quality Comics Group is a trademarked name (presumably taking its name from Stamford's nickname of 'the Quality City') encompassing Comic Favorites Inc., E.M. Arnold Publications, Smash Comics, and any other imprints owned by Arnold\\". A 1954 federal documentArchive of . Reocities archive of original . noted that the Quality Romance Group, owned by Everett M. and Claire C. Arnold, with an office at 347 Madison Avenue, in New York City, published two titles as Arnold Publications, Inc., two titles as Comic Favorites, Inc., and 14 titles as Comic Magazines, Inc. The Spirit Will Eisner's \\"Spirit Section\\" appeared in 20 major newspapers, premiering June 2, 1940, and continuing through 1952.In late 1939, Arnold orchestrated two roughly concurrent events. First, he made Will Eisner an offer to join Quality Comics' art staff. Eisner agreed to a complicated arrangement in which, Eisner recalled, \\"I regarded him as a partner and he thought of me as an employee\\".Will Eisner interview, Alter Ego #48, May 2005, p. 9 Whatever the specific business details, \\"The Eisner-Iger amalgam was dissolved, Iger buying out his partner's share of the organization\\", wrote historian Jim Steranko, who interviewed both Eisner and Arnold in the early 1970s. \\"In the bargain, Eisner took the shop's key men with him: Viscardi [also known as Nick Cardy], [Lou] Fine, Bob Powell, Chuck Cuidera, and others.\\"Steranko, p. 112 Second, Arnold explored an expansion into newspapers, with the idea of a Sunday-supplement comic-book section. Compiling a presentation piece with existing Quality Comics features, he contacted editors he knew from when he was vice president of Greater Buffalo Press. An editor of The Washington Star liked George Brenner's \\"The Clock\\", but not Brenner's art, and was favorably disposed toward a Lou Fine strip. Arnold, concerned over the meticulous Fine's slowness and his ability to meet deadlines, claimed it was Eisner's work. Arnold and Eisner had already been discussing a new feature, which would evolve into The Spirit. In \\"late '39, just before Christmas time, 'Busy' came to me and said that the Sunday newspapers were looking for a way of getting into this comic book boom\\", Eisner recalled in 1979.Panels #1 (Summer 1979), \\"Art & Commerce: An Oral Reminiscence by Will Eisner\\", pp. 5-21, quoted in In a 2004 interview, he elaborated on that meeting: Eisner negotiated an agreement with the syndicate in which Arnold would copyright The Spirit, but, \\"Written down in the contract I had with 'Busy' Arnold ‚Äî and this contract exists today as the basis for my copyright ownership ‚Äî Arnold agreed that it was my property. They agreed that if we had a split-up in any way, the property would revert to me on that day that happened. My attorney went to 'Busy' Arnold and his family, and they all signed a release agreeing that would not pursue the question of ownership\\". This would include the eventual backup features, \\"Mr. Mystic\\" and \\"Lady Luck\\". Martin of the Register and Tribune Syndicate signed a contract for a 16-page weekly section. After Arnold sold it to The Washington Star, The Baltimore Sun and The Philadelphia Record, the syndicate then acted as sales agent. \\"The Spirit Section\\", as it came to be colloquially called, eventually appeared in 20 major newspapers, premiering June 2, 1940, and continuing through 1952. Later career=Comics Arnold's companies became highly successful during comics' World War II boomtime, the period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books. Helping Arnold were wartime paper-quota laws, under which publications begun before the war received far higher allotments than those begun afterward. Postwar, he kept up with changes in taste, renaming Military Comics as Modern Comics (beginning with issue #44, Nov. 1945), turning the superhero series Crack Comics into Crack Western (with #63, Nov. 1949) and changing Kid Eternity into Buccaneers (with #19, Jan. 1950). He bought out the Cowles' brothers interest for $140,000 in 1950; during their 13-year partnership, the Cowles had earned nearly $1.8 million on their original $1,000 investment.Steranko, p. 109 Among his philanthropic efforts around this time, wealthy alumnus Arnold paid the Brown University tuition of college football player Joe Paterno, who attended from 1946 to 1950 before going on to become the College Football Hall of Fame coach of Penn State University. During the 1950s, Quality Comics followed the prevailing comics trends away from superheroes to a wide range of genres. This included a single horror title, Web of Evil, that nonetheless made Arnold's otherwise wholesome company a target, like many other comics publishers, as a supposed factor in juvenile delinquency, as charged by Dr. Fredric Wertham's book Seduction of the Innocent and Congressional hearings led by Senator Estes Kefauver. Together with his staff's individual departures as time went on, Arnold in 1956 closed his company, selling most of its properties to DC Comics. The final Quality titles, including Heart Throbs #46, Robin Hood Tales #6, and Yanks in Battle #4, were cover-dated December 1956. Comics historian Jim Steranko wrote that, \\"Arnold was, without a doubt, one of the most generous comic publishers. He was always very fair with the artists and believed in sharing the wealth. He often delivered an extra bonus to his men in appreciation for their work and loyalty. He was, perhaps, the only publisher who paid his men what they were really worth.\\"Steranko, p. 97 Magazines He started Arnold Magazines, Inc., edited by Alfred Grenet, with editorial offices at 303 Lexington Avenue in Manhattan. Mostly 35-cent digests, his publications included Homicide Detective Story Magazine, which ran stories by John D. MacDonald and William Campbell Gault. It later became Killers Mystery Story Magazine. Among its sister publications were Crime and Justice Detective Story Magazine (which included writers G.T. Fleming-Roberts, Robert Sidney Bowen, Harlan Ellison and Edward D. Hoch) and Terror Detective Story Magazine, each of which ran four issues from 1956 through March 1957. Blazing Guns, a Western digest, ran at least three issues during that time, as did Classic Photography, an innocuous (by modern standards) magazine of photo techniques plus shots of nude and semi-nude women; issue #3 (Spring 1957) featured Bunny Yeager on the cover. The Autumn and Fall 1956 issues were deemed \\"obscene\\" by the Post Office, and not applicable for second-class (standard magazine) mailing rates.\\"ARNOLD MAGAZINES, INC., Publisher of CLASSIC PHOTOGRAPHY Magazine for Order to Show Cause Why Application for Second-Class Entry Should Not be Granted.

The film is based on the novel by Rolf Hochhuth about a woman who commits adultery with a prisoner of war while her husband serves as a soldier during World War II. A Love in Germany, featuring many popular German actors, was produced by German film producer Artur Brauner and German broadcaster ZDF. Synopsis The story takes place in the German village of , at the border to Switzerland. A man and his son visit the village to find out about an incident in the life of the man's mother, Pauline Kropp, in 1941 in this village. However, they are met with mistrust by the local population. In 1941, the owner of the local fruit-and-vegetables shop has been called up. His shop has a key function for the town's supply situation. His customers know from World War I how rationing can make the owner of such a shop very rich if only he's egoistic enough to get corrupted by well-heeled customers who don't care whether their poorer country fellowmen's families starve. So when his wife Pauline starts to run the shop alone, her character is subsequently of public interest for all citizens who are concerned about the well-being of their families during the ongoing war. Pauline, still young and attractive, shares the fate of other soldiers' wives who constantly face the fear her husband might return crippled, maimed or not at all. But because her husband's shop is highly important for the town's community, she gets somebody who can ease her working load, and so a Polish prisoner of war named Stanis≈Çaw must serve her. She obviously finds him handsome and relishes that he has to obey all her commands. Eventually she seduces him; the unlikely couple sometimes celebrate their love even literally in the open. Even when a town's official informs her that her evident bliss leads other women to doubt her integrity she still doesn't let go of her love affair. The town official keeps on warning her that under the prevailing Nazi laws her adultery is punishable as \\"Rassenschande\\". Pauline keeps on putting the Polish POW in lethal danger until he is finally taken to court and sentenced to death. Pauline is imprisoned for two years. Her son and her grandson are appalled when they realise that the official, who initially had warned Pauline but in the end had abandoned her, still lives in this very village. Background The film was shot in the villages of Efringen, Eimeldingen and Tumringen. Some scenes were shot at the Spandau Studios in West Berlin. The production set was designed by Allan Starski and G√∂tz Heymann, costumes were designed by Krystyna Zachwatowicz and Ingrid Zor√©. Reception The film was not received too well by the German public, Der Spiegel, 45/1983 calling it a \\"cinema mishap\\", the Lexikon des Internationalen Films calling it \\"full of clich√©s\\". Andrzej Wajda later reflected on the circumstances of making the film: On Rotten Tomatoes, A Love in Germany holds a rating of 57% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 21 reviews.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/love_in_germany Accolades The film was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film of 1984 by the U.S. National Board of Review of Motion Pictures.

It stars Kevin Costner as an escaped convict who takes a young boy (T.J. Lowther) hostage and attempts escape on the road with the child. Eastwood co-stars as a Texas Ranger in pursuit of the convict. Plot In 1963 Texas, convicts Robert \\"Butch\\" Haynes (Kevin Costner) and Terry Pugh (Keith Szarabajka) escape from the state penitentiary in Huntsville. Fleeing, Pugh stumbles into a house where eight-year-old Phillip Perry (T.J. Lowther) lives with his devout Jehovah's Witness mother and two sisters. Butch follows, and hits Pugh to make him stop molesting the mother. Needing a hostage to aid their escape, Butch grabs the boy, who meekly accompanies them. The trio's journey soon hits an unpleasant note as Butch kills Terry, following the latter's attempt to harm the child. With his partner out of the way, the convict and his young victim take to the Texas highway in an attempt to flee from the pursuing police. Meanwhile, Texas Ranger Red Garnett (Clint Eastwood), riding in Governor John Connolly's airstream trailer, is in pursuit. With criminologist Sally Gerber (Laura Dern) and FBI sharpshooter Bobby Lee (Bradley Whitford) in tow, Red is determined to recover the criminal and the hostage before they cross the Texas border. Also, Red reveals to Sally that he has a personal interest in apprehending Butch alive. Even though Butch doesn't realize it, Red has a history with him. When Butch was a teenager, he stole a car, and Red was the arresting officer. Butch was living with his abusive father, also a criminal, at the time. Due to his age and it being a first offense, Butch was supposed to get a lenient sentence. Red thought juvenile prison was safer for Butch than home, and muses that some of the kids who went through Gatesville turned out ok, and one even became a priest. He also felt that if Butch had been left at home with his father, he would have a rap sheet \\"as long as my arm.\\" Red asked the judge to give Butch a harsh sentence. Years later, Red has come to realize that the harsher sentence only encouraged the very life of crime he feared would happen. Now, Red is hoping that if he can bring Butch in alive, he can redeem himself for his past mistake. Phillip, eight years old, has never participated in Halloween or Christmas celebrations. Escaping with Butch, however, he experiences a freedom which he finds exhilarating, as Butch gladly allows him the kind of indulgences he has been forbidden, including the wearing of a shoplifted Casper the Friendly Ghost costume. Gradually, Phillip becomes increasingly aware of his surroundings, and with constant encouragement from Butch, seems to acquire the ability to make independent decisions on what is wrong and right. Butch slowly finds himself drawn into giving Phillip the kind of fatherly presence which he himself never had. Butch and Phillip try to make it to New Mexico, but find out that the highway they are driving on is unfinished. While asleep in their car in a cornfield, they encounter Mack, a farmer, and his family - Lottie his wife, and his grandson Cleveland. Mack frequently abuses Cleveland, which Butch tries to tolerate, but when Mack figures out who he is he puts a stop to it. He beats Mack and plans on killing him, but Phillip picks up Butch's gun and shoots Butch in the stomach. Phillip walks out of the house, drops the gun into a well, throws the car keys away, and runs across a meadow. Butch follows, and rests at the tree Phillip has climbed. In the following dialogue Phillip apologizes for shooting Butch who tells him he did the right thing. Red's team surrounds the field where Phillip and Butch are situated, and Butch soon sends the boy to his mother, who has arrived by helicopter and who Butch has made promise to take Phillip trick-or- treating every year. Unwilling to leave the already wounded Butch, the boy runs back and hugs him ‚Äì a gesture which, along with his knowledge of Butch's character and background, convinces Red that he can resolve the situation peacefully. His plans are thwarted, however, when Bobby Lee, mistaking one of Butch's gestures to mean he is about to draw a gun, shoots him in the chest, killing him. The move leaves Red angry and frustrated at his inability to save Butch and take him alive. Red punches Bobby Lee and Sally knees him in the groin before walking away. Phillip is then reunited with his mother, and they fly away in a helicopter while Phillip sadly looks through the window at Butch's lifeless body in the meadow.

He was also in the midst of campaigning for the Academy Awards with Unforgiven and saw A Perfect World as an opportunity to work as a director only and take a break from acting. However, when Kevin Costner was approached with the screenplay for the movie, he suggested that Eastwood would be perfect for the role of Texas Ranger Red Garnett. Eastwood agreed, realizing that his screentime would not be as significant, leaving most of the time to work behind the camera. The film was shot in Austin, Texas, and Martindale, Texas, in between San Marcos and Lockhart in the spring and summer of 1993.Hughes, p.84 Reception A Perfect World was released in United States theaters in November 1993, grossing $31.1 million in box office receipts in the United StatesHughes, p.85 with an international gross of $104 million for a total of $135.2 million. The film received largely positive reviews, with a 79% score on Rotten Tomatoes based on 33 reviews. The site's critical consensus states, \\"Despite some formulaic touches, Clint Eastwood's haunting, ambiguous crime drama is smart and gritty, and features a bravura performance from Kevin Costner as a prison escapee on the run\\". The film won considerable praise for its emotional depth and accurate depiction of the psychology of hostage situations. Kevin Costner's subtly nuanced portrayal of the escaped convict Butch Haynes forms the cornerstone of the film's success and has been hailed as one of the actor's finest performances yet.\\"A Perfect World ‚Äì A Film Review\\" by James Berardinelli Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun- Times called it \\"a film any director alive might be proud to sign,\\" while The New York Times hailed it as \\"a deeply felt, deceptively simple film that marks the high point of Mr. Eastwood's directing career thus far.\\" In the years since its release, the film has been acclaimed by critics as one of Eastwood's most satisfying (albeit underrated) directorial achievements, and the scenes between the convict (Costner) and his young captive (T. J. Lowther) have been acknowledged as some of the most delicately crafted sequences in all of Eastwood's body of work. Cahiers du cin√©ma selected A Perfect World as the best film of 1993.

He made his Test debut, Australia v England at Adelaide in January 1898 playing in 18 Test matches until 1904. Howell's finest achievement was taking 10-28 against Surrey during Australia's 1899 tour of England. The Cricket oval at Penrith Stadium is named after Bill Howell. In January 1898, Bill Howell played in his first test match against England at Adelaide Oval and made two trips to England in 1899 and 1902, and to South Africa in 1902. In August that year Tom Dickson convened a meeting of local cricketers at the Commercial Hotel in Penrith and as a result the Nepean District Cricket Association was formed. Its competition trophy was the Lees Shield presented by Local Member Samuel Lees which was to become the property of the first club to win it three times. That honour went to the Castlereagh Club. Locally, in one match Howell took ten wickets for ten runs, and in another hit seven sixes from a seven ball over. While overseas in 1902, his parents, George and Hannah (Colless) Howell died within days of each other. They owned two farms valued at ¬£1,165. After his retirement from international cricket Bill Howell returned to one farm at Castlereagh, while his brother Athol took up the adjoining farm. In 1899, Bill married Neva, the daughter of James and Sarah Hunter of Emu Plains. In 1957, Howell Oval in Penrith was dedicated to the cricketing achievements of William Peter Howell. William Peter Howell was to become renowned as one of Australia's most eminent Test bowlers, despite having to play for most of his career in the same side as that bowling genius, Hugh Trumble. On Australian wickets, the strongly-built farm lad with the biggest of handlebar moustaches used a skillful variation of flight and pace to deceive opposition batsmen into an act of self-destruction. In England, his ability to impart massive spin on the ball enabled him to beat the bat consistently with turn. The snap of Howell's strong fingers caused the ball to literally buzz in its flight towards the awaiting batsman - an appropriate result for a New South Wales beekeeper. Quicker than Trumble, his main weapon was a devastating off-break but Howell also used a quick-turning leg-break as a variation. Even on the hard turf of Australia he could turn the ball more than his colleagues. Howell claimed all 10 Surrey wickets for 28 in his first bowling stint in England in 1899. Howell also appreciated the value of the ball that whips straight on without turning and was of great value to a succession of Australian teams in England, except on a sticky wicket when his break was sometimes too big. When Joe Darling took his team to South Africa for the first time in 1902-03, Howell ensured success for Australia in a three-match Test series by taking 14 wickets at 12.42 in the two games he played. From a 1967 NT News newspaper article about that tour of South Africa: But the highlight of the Australian tour was the devastating off-spin bowling of Bill Howell. Left out of the first match because he was thought to be out of form, Howell played in the next five and took 48 wickets at a cost of just over nine runs each. A farmer from Rooty Hill near Sydney and a man with huge hands, Howell was noted for the amount of work he got on the ball. In South Africa Howell was almost unplayable. Deliveries turning viciously from outside the off-stump sometimes had the effect of making the shaken batsman turn his head first over one shoulder, then the other, wondering what had happened to the ball.

Woot was acquired by Amazon in 2010, and Rutledge resigned his position at Amazon in 2012. Rutledge launched a new daily-deal site, Meh, in 2014. Early life Rutledge grew up in San Antonio and Carrollton, Texas. He was an undistinguished high school student. He then moved to the St. Louis, Missouri area to live with his mother, but returned to Texas to avoid paying some $8,000 in traffic tickets. Origins and Founding of Woot While working at a Dallas-area computer retailer called Resource Concepts, Rutledge began attending the monthly First Saturday swap meets, selling refurbished PC parts from a truck in the wee hours of the morning. In 1994, Rutledge launched his first company, Synapse Micro, wholesaling tech products to primarily mom-and-pop computer shops. In 2004, Rutledge launched Woot as an outgrowth of Synapse Micro, offering a single product a day at steeply discounted prices. \\"I wanted it to be a blog and a store at the same time,\\" Rutledge told Inc. Magazine. To that end, he encouraged the site's copywriters to be entertainingly frank about the shortcomings of the often obsolete products sold on the site. \\"We feel that if we don't do a good job describing what's wrong with a product, people will assume we just don't know. That's where most retailers fail. To them, every product is perfect.\\" After four years of rapid growth, in 2008 Woot was named the #1 Fastest Growing Private Retail Company in America and the #1 Fastest Growing Private Company in the Dallas-Fort Worth Area by Inc.. Acquisition by Amazon In June 2010, Amazon acquired Woot for a reported $110 million. Rutledge remained as CEO. The company's headquarters remained in Carrollton, although the creative and web development team, previously based in St. Louis, moved to the Amazon campus in Seattle. Amazon's ownership of Woot was characterized by increasing complexity of the company's simple business model, moving away from the deal-of-the-day approach to a broader collection of flash sales. Critics claimed that the post-acquisition Woot lost much of its appeal. Woot \\"was just too eccentric to slot smoothly into a big company that thrives on being orderly. So all those crazy edges got hacked off until it did fit,\\" wrote CNET blogger Amanda Kooser in 2013. \\"This approach is all Amazon knows. It's just too bad it had to stomp out a fun little corner of geek commerce and camaraderie in the process.\\" Rutledge largely agreed with these criticisms and took some of the responsibility for them, saying he was \\"unable to represent our needs in a succinct, convincing manner\\" within Amazon. \\"The goal-based tactical needs of Amazon were unable to appreciate a relatively small artful business model with different growth drivers.\\" Founding of Mediocre Laboratories and meh.com Rutledge left Woot in 2012 citing his greater interest in creating and growing new companies than in managing an Amazon subsidiary. His first public project after leaving Woot was A Mediocre Corporation, so named, in Rutledge's words, \\"to lower expectations with the brand\\". Rutledge paid $100,000 for the meh.com domain in June 2014. A Mediocre Corporation launched Meh.com in July 2014, preceded by a Kickstarter campaign describing Meh as a revival of \\"The Classic Daily Deal Site\\". \\"The underlying premise is that we're building a store that you don't need to buy anything from to have fun,\\" Rutledge told Business Insider.

He and his group won the Grammy Award for Best Zydeco or Cajun Music Album in 2008. Simien and several of his other band mates, Danny J. Williams, Stan Chambers and Jose Alvarez won their second GRAMMY in 2013, Dockside Sessions for Best Regional Roots Record, produced by George Receli, (Bob Dylan, White Trash, Lou Garou). Simien is an eighth generation Creole from one of the earliest Creole families documented to have settled in the Mallet area of St. Landry Parish. He was introduced to music via the piano at home, the Catholic Church choir, and in school band programs where he played trumpet. While in his teens, he taught himself to play accordion and formed his first band Terrance Simien & The Mallet Playboys, and began to play the regional zydeco club and church hall circuit. In the early 1980s, Simien was a youth in his early 20s and one of only two (Sam Brothers was the other) emerging zydeco artists leading a band and performing their indigenous zydeco roots music. This was a pivotal time in zydeco music history since the pioneers of the genre were aging and the music was in jeopardy of dying off without the critical presence of emerging artists continuing the traditions.The Houston International Festival Artist Bio Terrance Simien & The Zydeco Experience Upon being asked about his opinion of his debut album in a 1991 interview, Simien said: \\"I think we've done what we set out to do, and that is catch the energy of the live performance. Also give the audience something new that we couldn't do live. But we basically stayed true to what we were doing; we didn't try to make a hit song. We just put out what we've been doing for the past five years on the road, and it couldn't have come out any better than it did. There are some disappointments. You always wish you had more time, more money, more everything.\\" Simien and his group have toured internationally, presenting over 8500 live performances in more than 45 countries, and released dozens of solo recordings and collaborations. He has shared studio and stage with the likes of Paul Simon, Dr. John, The Meters, Marcia Ball, Dave Matthews, Stevie Wonder, Robert Palmer and the roots rockers Los Lobos. Simien has appeared on screen and contributed to the soundtracks of multiple movies, television films and commercials. He appears on the soundtrack of the Disney film, The Princess and the Frog set in the French Quarter of New Orleans, featuring authentic Louisiana music scored by Randy Newman. He has also contributed to the soundtracks of movies, such as, The Big Easy, Exit To Eden and A Murder Of Crows. Simien and his business partner/wife, Cynthia, are active in Creole music education and advocacy. They created the \\"Creole for Kidz & The History of Zydeco\\" performing arts program, which provides informational performances to K-12 students, teachers and parents. Since it was created in 2001, Creole for Kidz has reached nearly 500,000 students, parents and teachers in more than 20 states, Mali, Dominican Republic, Brazil, Paraguay, Canada and Australia. The Simiens understand the importance of mentoring emerging artists and created MusicMatters, Inc., a non-profit for education and advocacy. In 2007, the Simiens helped establish a new Grammy voting category, Best Zydeco or Cajun Music Album.Brasseaux, Ryan A. Cajun breakdown: the emergence of an American-made music.

It is based on a true story of a mob war in South Philadelphia. The film stars James Marsden, Giovanni Ribisi and Brad Renfro and features appearances by Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer, Piper Perabo, Lesley Ann Warren, Tommy Lee, 1980s Italian comedian, singer, actor and director Francesco Salvi and Brian Dennehy. The film was billed as based on a story by \\"Donnie Brasco\\", the undercover name of FBI agent Joseph Pistone, who successfully infiltrated the Mafia, as portrayed in the movie of the same name starring Johnny Depp and Al Pacino. While the film is set in Philadelphia, it was filmed in Pittsburgh, with scenes at Tom's Diner and Bloom Cigar Company in the South Side and Hartwood Mansion. Synopsis Tommy is the son of a Mafia hitman, who, after his father is killed by a rival, moves with his younger brother to live with his aunt, uncle and cousin in Philadelphia. The sole member of his family who is not involved in crime, Tommy joins the Marines and fights in Operation Desert Storm. Becoming disillusioned when the conflict ended with Saddam Hussein still in power. and disenchanted with military service, Tommy assaults an MP, and steals a colonel's Jeep. Arrested when the jeep runs out of gas, the movie opens with Tommy in the brig at a US Marine base. An FBI agent (played by Dennehy) coerces Tommy into infiltrating the family business. The agent tells Tommy that he can protect his brother and cousin in return for evidence against the Sicilian mob trying to take over the heroin trade in the US. Tommy is instructed to wear a wire to record negotiations between his cousin and gang leader, Joey Marcucci and Mafia boss Luciano Reggio.

In a news conference on March 2, President Richard Nixon stated that the United States would \\"not pay blackmail\\". American negotiators seemed confused as to how to best respond to the hostage-takers' demands, and Nixon seemed to believe that the gunmen would give themselves up in exchange for safe passage as others had done when storming the Israeli embassy in Bangkok a year earlier. After twelve hours, the gunmen stated that they had killed Noel, Moore and Eid, the three Western diplomats in their custody. They demanded a plane to take them and their hostages to the United States, which was rejected by both the Sudanese and American governments. The Sudanese government continued to negotiate with the militants, and after three days the gunmen released the remaining hostages and surrendered to Sudanese authorities. In the aftermath it was found that the three deceased diplomats had been taken to the basement and killed.Dershowitz. A. 2002. Why Terrorism Works: understanding the threat, responding to the challenge. R.R. Donnelly & Sons Co, Inc. U.S.  Aftermath  In October 1973, charges against two of the militants were dropped for insufficient evidence. A court of inquiry commenced to try the remaining six in June 1974. The court sentenced the six to life imprisonment before their sentences were reduced to seven years. The US government unsuccessfully lobbied the Sudanese government to put them to death. Sudanese President Gaafar Nimeiry was on an official trip abroad during the incident and condemned it in the strongest terms on his return, stating that the perpetrators rewarded Sudan, which had provided peaceful sanctuary to Palestinian refugees, with the disturbance of Sudan's internal peace. He decided to delegate the punishment of the perpetrators to their compatriots and handed the six to the custody of the Palestine Liberation Organization. The next day, the PLO sent the six to Egypt, where they were to serve their sentences. In protest of Sudan's handling of this situation, the United States withdrew its ambassador to Sudan and froze economic assistance to Sudan in June. A new US ambassador returned to Sudan in November that year, and aid resumed in 1976. Three of the Black September militants disappeared from Egyptian custody and were never recaptured. The remaining three served out their sentences. The United States also tried to prosecute Yasser Arafat in the United States for his role in event. However, John R. Bolton, then Assistant Attorney General at the Department of Justice, in 1986 concluded that they lacked the legal jurisdiction for trying Arafat, as the appropriate statutory laws were not yet in force in 1973.

The nomenclature was launched in 1956, as the 1939-1948 Lincoln Continental was succeeded by the Continental Mark II. From 1958 to 1960, the Mark III, IV and V were marketed by Mercury-Edsel-Lincoln (M-E-L) Division. Following a hiatus, the Mark series was relaunched in 1968 by Lincoln-Mercury; six further generations were produced through 1998. Serving as the flagship of Ford Motor Company, the Mark series has primarily been produced as a two-door coupe (other body styles have been offered through its production). With the exception of the nearly hand-built Continental Mark II, the model line has shared chassis underpinnings with other Ford vehicles, styled with their own interior and exterior body panels (notably the use of continental tire trunklids associated with the brand) Following the 1998 model year, the Mark VIII was discontinued and not replaced, with Lincoln choosing to concentrate on its sedan and SUV model lines; the closest four-door equivalent to the Mark VIII was the LS V8 (and the later MKS). From 2007 to 2020, Lincoln used an \\"MK\\" prefix for its sedans (phased out in favor of conventional names or dropped altogether). From 1958 to 1998, all Mark-series vehicles were produced by Wixom Assembly at Wixom, Michigan.  Background  Before there were series of \\"Continental Mark\\", \\"Lincoln Mark\\", or \\"Lincoln MK\\" models, there were various models built by the Ford organization employing the name \\"Continental\\". These began in the 1930s with a one-off car, a custom personal car that ended up serving the function of a concept car, which Edsel Ford directed his designers to create. It began with the existing design of the Lincoln-Zephyr and was modified extensively. It was called the \\"Continental\\" because it was meant to capture an essence of Continental European luxury. This first car led to a production model, the first of the \\"Lincoln Continental\\" series, which was built from 1939 to 1948. At the time work had begun on the first Continental coupe, Lincoln had previously cancelled the Lincoln K-series coupes, sedans, and limousines, and produced the very limited Lincoln Custom limousine, along with the smaller Lincoln- Zephyr coupes and sedans. Mr. Ford wanted to revive the popularity of the 1929‚Äì1932 Lincoln Victoria coupe and convertible but with a more modern approach, reflecting European styling influences for the Continental. In 1955, Ford Motor Company chose to introduce a new personal luxury car as a successor to the pre-war Lincoln Continental. As it was to be one of the most exclusive and expensive automobiles in the world, Ford chose to create a stand-alone division above Lincoln. The new Continental Mark II of the Continental Division adopted a naming convention of \\"mark number\\", also meaning \\"version number\\" or \\"model number\\"; while used in the European automotive industry, this was also used to identify versions of artillery, tanks, naval vessels, and aircraft, as demonstrated with the Jaguar Mark 1. The name was thus equivalent in original meaning to simply \\"Continental, version 2\\" or \\"Continental, model B\\", although the name \\"Mark\\" later took on a brand-like feel of its own in the minds of many customers, which later branding efforts then expanded upon. In July 1956, the Continental Division was integrated into the Lincoln-Mercury Division, which managed the Continental as a separate marque within the division. The division introduced the Continental Mark III, IV, and V to replace the Continental Mark II; they served as the flagships of the Lincoln-Mercury Division. For 1961, Lincoln was pared down to a single model line. The Continental name was suspended as a marque as the Mark series vehicles were discontinued and Continental became the sole Lincoln model name. For 1968, Lincoln restarted the Continental Mark series with the Continental Mark III as a true successor to the Continental Mark II. Instead of being a flagship model of the standard Lincoln, the Continental Mark III was an all- new car. Based on the Ford Thunderbird, it was strictly a personal-luxury coupe like the Continental Mark II and the 1939‚Äì1948 Continental, thus restarting the series at Mark III. Continental as a stand alone marque without Lincoln badging was resumed for the new Mark III model. While sharing little to no common bodywork, the Mark series would share much of its underpinnings with the Ford Thunderbird for most of its entire production run from 1969 to 1998. The only exceptions were 1977‚Äì1979 when the Thunderbird was downsized to the intermediate Ford Torino platform; and the 1980‚Äì1983 Continental Mark VI, which was based on the Ford LTD/Mercury Marquis and Lincoln Town Car. The 1958‚Äì1960 Continental Mark III‚ÄìV and the 1980‚Äì1983 Continental Mark VI were the only Mark series vehicles ever produced with an available 4-door body style.  First generation (Mark II; 1956‚Äì1957)  The Continental Mark II was a personal luxury car produced by a newly formed Continental Division of the Ford Motor Company for only two model years: 1956 and 1957. The Mark II was available only as a two-door hardtop coupe. The new model eschewed chrome- laden styling of the period. Its understated design evoked a European simplicity of line. The Continental Mark II featured a pre-war Continental- style spare tire hump, shared the new Lincoln Y-block V8 engine and running gear, and was sold and serviced at Lincoln dealerships. Four-door and convertible versions were explored by Ford, but not developed. Most of the car was hand-built to high standards, including multiple coats of paint hand- sanded down, double-lacquered, and polished. The car's price was US$10,000 (US$ in dollars); was as much as a Rolls-Royce or two top-of-the-line Cadillacs at that time. All Mark IIs were equipped with power steering, power brakes, power windows, automatic transmission, motorized radio and antenna, as well as a luxurious interior of imported Scottish, Bridge of Weir leather. The only option available was air conditioning. The 1956 models had small \\"scoops\\" for air intake located on the upper rear fenders. Cool air from the trunk- mounted evaporator coil entered the passenger compartment from four vent registers located in the corners of the roof headliner.  Successor (Mark III, Mark IV, Mark V; 1958‚Äì1960)  Following the cancellation of the Continental Mark II coupe at the end of the 1957 model year, Ford Motor Company sought for ways to improve the profitability of its flagship model line. After the Continental Division was absorbed by Lincoln-Mercury in July 1956, the Continental name was used as Ford's top level marque, sharing bodystyles with Lincoln-branded vehicles. For marketing purposes, the new Mark III was not called a Lincoln, and wore Continental badging on the vehicle. This was done to position Continental-branded vehicles against top-level Cadillacs and Imperials. In a major move to cut production costs, the hand assembly seen on the Mark II coupe was replaced as the Mark III was assembled in the same factory alongside the Lincoln Capri and Lincoln Premiere. In order to distinguish the Continental from Lincolns, stylists gave the vehicle its own roofline. Featuring a reverse-slanted retractable rear window, called \\"Breezeway\\", it was featured in all Continental-branded models (including convertibles). Although released in the middle of the 1958 recession (that would add to the problems with the Edsel), the Mark III would prove far more successful than its predecessor due to a $4000 (nearly 40%) reduction in price; while still expensive, the number of potential buyers was far higher. Due to the production costs of developing the unibody platform, Lincoln would lose over $60 million in total over 1958‚Äì1960 production. While far easier to produce, the Mark III was still advanced for the time. Continentals were still available with air conditioning, this time with dashboard-mounted vents. For the first time, FM radio joined AM radio as an option. Another feature was \\"Auto Lube\\"; as long as the owner kept the oil reservoir full, the car automatically lubricated itself. For 1959, the Mark III became the Mark IV, with two new bodystyles. Intended to compete against formal sedans from Cadillac and Imperial, Lincoln introduced a Continental Town Car and Limousine. To increase rear-seat room, the retractable rear window was replaced by a standard-slant window. Limousine models were distinguished by the use of a rear-seat partition. Other features included dual air- conditioning units and a padded vinyl top. Both models were only available painted in black. The Town Car cost over $9,200 with a total of 214 sold over both years, and the Limousine cost $10,200 with only a total of 83 sold, making it more expensive and perhaps even more exclusive than the Mark II. For 1960, the Mark V was given a minor styling update, with a larger grille and new \\"dagmar bumpers\\". In terms of standard production sedans without an extended wheelbase, the 1958‚Äì1960 Lincolns are some of the largest automobiles ever made. The Continental Mark III‚ÄìV are the longest cars produced by the Ford Motor Company without federally mandated 5-mph bumpers. The 1959 Mark IV and 1960 Mark V Limousines and Town Cars are the heaviest American standard- wheelbase sedans built since World War II. 1960 is the only model year that a Mark series vehicle is mentioned as a Lincoln Continental Mark V in brochures and advertising. The reputation for the Mark III-V‚Äôs \\"excessive styling\\" is perhaps ironic given the enormous amount of styling talent that was connected with the development and modification of Marks of this vintage. Second generation (Mark III; 1969‚Äì1971) The Continental Mark III was manufactured by Lincoln for model years 1969 through 1971. The Mark III was created when Lee Iacocca, president of Ford Motor Company at the time, directed Design Vice President, Gene Bordinat, to \\"put a Rolls Royce grille on a Thunderbird\\". in September 1965. The Mark III was based on the four-door Thunderbird platform, which was first introduced for 1967. It joined the larger 1966 Lincoln Continental 2-door sedan. The Mark III competed with Cadillac's front-wheel- drive Eldorado and Imperial Crown Coupe, which bowed for the 1967 model year and held the upper rung in the personal luxury car market. Introduced on April 5, 1968, as a 1969 model, the Continental Mark III outsold its Cadillac and Imperial rivals each model year. The Mark III took many of its design cues from the mainstream Ford Thunderbird. Distinguishing features included a prominent grille, hidden headlights, and a Continental spare tire hump in the decklid. Differences for the 1969 model year included eight new exterior colors and an optional white leather/vinyl interior, as well as new headrests, steering wheel styling, instrument panel knobs, and color-keyed vinyl boots on the front seat belt anchors varied. A Cartier dash clock was introduced in December 1968. The 1970 model introduced a technical innovation - it was the first American-made vehicle with radial tires as standard equipment.Vaughan, Daniel Conceptcarz.com 1969 Lincoln Continental news, pictures, specifications, and information September 2008 Retrieved July 26, 2015 The 1970 model year cars included the formerly optional vinyl roof and Sure-Track anti-lock braking system. The interior wood trim was upgraded to genuine walnut wood trim (all 1969 models featured either East India Rosewood or English Oak wood appliques depending on the interior color). The Continental lettering on the decklid was bolted on (instead of glued on for 1969). The seat and door trim pattern was changed to a simpler design (instead of the diamond-pattern, button-tufted design of 1969). Also new were a locking steering column, a rim-blow-horn steering wheel, map light off delay device, concealed electric windshield wipers with adjustable intermittent feature, and a three-point restraint system for front outboard occupants. The 1971 model year cars received tinted windows, and an automatic climate control. High-back Twin Comfort lounge seats with two-way power controls were also new.  Third generation (Mark IV; 1972‚Äì1976)  The Mark IV carried over many design themes of the Mark III including the grille and faux spare tire trunk lid, and grew both longer and wider -- sharing its platform with the Ford Thunderbird. In 1972, Lincoln introduced the small oval windows, marketed as opera windows, at the roof rear quarters. The 1973 model year featured front bumpers to comply with new US safety regulations that required all passenger cars to withstand a front and a rear impact. 1974 models featured redesigned rear bumpers under mandatory federal safety regulations. It was the heaviest series of all generations. Mark IVs were powered by a V8 engine. Luxury Group options Beginning in 1973 special Luxury Group packages were offered in various paint, roof, and interior color schemes from year to year. The Silver Luxury Group for 1973 included Silver \\"Moondust\\" metallic paint with a matching silver grained vinyl roof and a silver leather interior. Or, if the buyer preferred a color contrast, Cranberry (deep red) velour or leather interior trim was available. For 1974, a Gold Luxury Group and a Saddle & White Luxury Group (April 1974 introduction) joined the carryover Silver Luxury Group. For 1975, a Blue Diamond Luxury Group and a Lipstick & White Luxury Group joined the three carryover packages from the previous model year. For 1976, in addition to certain ones that carried over from the previous model year, Lincoln offered a dizzying array of new Luxury Group packages: Jade/White, Light Jade/Dark Jade, Red/Rose, Gold/Cream, Black Diamond (March 1976 introduction), and Desert Sand (March 1976 introduction). Lincoln continued to offer similar color-coordinating Luxury Group packages on the Mark V and Mark VI. Designer editions Beginning with the 1976 model year, the Mark IV was available with four unique \\"designer editions\\". The names of three famous clothing designers and one jewelry designer, were available with four exclusive color combinations. Interior seat designs were basically carried over from the \\"luxury group\\" options but featured unique color combinations. The designer names were: Cartier, the French jewelry and fragrance designer, Bill Blass, the American designer, Givenchy, a French clothing designer, and Emilio Pucci, an Italian clothing and accessories designer. The name of the chosen package was embedded in the opera window of the car and also on the dashboard above or near the glovebox. The exterior and interior color combinations changed with each model year. The Bill Blass edition remained with the Mark series through 1992 while the others were not available after the 1983 model year (Emilio Pucci), 1982 model year (Givenchy), and 1979 model year (Cartier). Lincoln used designer editions for other models, as well. The 1980 through 1989 Town Car and the 1982 through 1987 Continental sedan.  Fourth generation (Mark V; 1977‚Äì1979)  Introduced for the 1977 model year, the Continental Mark V was a major revision of the Mark IV. The rounded styling of the previous generation gave way to a sharper-edged look. Interior design remained similar to the Mark IV, with variants in the seat patterns and dashboard trim (while retaining the general dashboard layout of the IV) being the primary differences. As the Ford Thunderbird was downsized and based on the intermediate chassis utilized by the Ford LTD II and Mercury Cougar XR7, the Mark V utilized its own chassis carried over from the Mark IV. The Mark V was larger and more complex than its predecessor, coming just ten inches short of long. The electrical system and mechanical componentry shared less in common with other Ford products, and was harder to service than the corresponding equipment on the Mark IV. The of the Mark IV no longer remained the standard engine of the Mark V, with the 400 becoming standard and the 460 optional, for both the 1977 and 1978 model years. The 460 was not available at all for 1979. After the 1976 model year, the 460 was no longer available in Lincolns sold in California, because it was not able to be emissions-certified for that state. By contrast, the 1977 Continentals were initially available ONLY with the 460 in the 49 states but around mid-production the 400 became standard and the 460 optional, except in California. The March 1977 update of the Lincoln Product Facts Book for 1977 shows these changes in red font. Evidence of a change as early as December 1976 is available. The author of these edits (March 2013) has a 49-state February 21 1977 Continental Town Car, the price sheet of which shows the 460 as an option. Marti reports, however, suggest that almost all 49-state Lincoln buyers chose the 460 after it became optional. Experts from Motor Trend, April 1980, which compared the then-new Mark VI (a Cartier 351-2 model with a 2.73:1 diff) against the Mark V (a Bill Blass model with a 3.08:1 diff): \\"....another automotive era ended in 1979. The press releases summed it up by calling the '79 Continental \\"the last traditionally full-sized American car.\\" The hardware of the matter is that the car is one of the largest mass-produced passenger cars ever to roll off an assembly line. With an overall length of 230.3 inches, a wheelbase of 120.3 inches, and a curb weight of 4,763 pounds, it is a dinosaur, and the changing nature of the times will no longer tolerate such blatantly consumptive machines for personal transportation.... ....The 1979 Mark V was the essence of unconstrained American automotive opulence, conceived in a time when fuel economy and space efficiency were the concerns of lesser cars. ....Though the styling of the Mark V was unchanged from '78 to '79, there were some mechanical and engineering refinements......Weight reduction techniques that included use of plastics, high-strength lightweight steel, thinner glass, and aluminum for such engine parts as the intake manifold and water pump produced a 400-pound weight reduction [from 1978], as compared to the 930 pounds surrendered by the Mark VI models. ....Even with the weight loss, the Mark V is a huge piece of machinery, albeit a desirable one in terms of potential value. It is the last of a breed and has sufficient quality and style to assure eventual classic status It is entirely likely that, in 10 years, the owners of such cars will discover that they have a piece of collectible automotive machinery. ....To drive the Mark V is to be the captain of your own huge, luxurious ship. In an operational sense, the Mark V is massive, smooth and competent only in boulevard or highway applications.....What it was designed to do, it does very well. It isolates the driver and passengers from the outside world, and when you're driving, it makes you feel - and makes other people think you are - rich. Even with its rather straight-lined, sharp-edged styling, the car has a certain rakishness and projects the image of the driver as an elegant rogue. ....This intangible quality is exactly what we found lacking in the Mark VI. It has a more formal look - the result of a more squared-off roof and trunk line - that would tend to make you think of the driver as a successful accountant....The interior produces none of that feeling of decadence. It is light and airy, as opposed to the cocoon feeling of the Mark V, and has a little too much space-age gadgetry and undisguised plastic to fit the traditional definitions of luxury. ....The Mark V is the pinnacle of 60 years of automotive definitions....\\"  Fifth generation (Mark VI; 1980‚Äì1983)  The Continental Mark VI introduced downsizing to the Mark series alongside the introduction of a four-door sedan bodystyle. Based on the success of the Mark V, the Mark VI adopted many of the exterior styling cues of its predecessor, including its oval opera windows, radiator-style grille, \\"Continental\\" spare-tire decklid, hidden headlamps, vertical taillamps, and front fender louvers. Sharing the Panther platform, the two-door Mark VI was derived from the shorter wheelbase of the Ford LTD/Mercury Marquis, with the four-door Mark VI sharing its chassis with the Continental (Town Car). The four-door was distinguished largely by its fenders, opera windows, and decklid; the two-door has a separate roofline from the two-door Town Car. In place of the previous 7.5L V8, a fuel-injected 4.9L V8 was standard (a 5.8L carbureted V8 was offered for 1980). In place of the LED trip computer of the Mark V, the Mark VI became one of the first American automobiles to offer a fully digital instrument panel (VFD), pushbutton keyless entry (a system still in use on Ford automobiles), and an overdrive 4-speed automatic transmission. The Mark VI continued the Designer Editions (Cartier, Bill Blass, Pucci, Givenchy) and introduced the first Signature Series trim.  Sixth generation (Mark VII; 1984‚Äì1992)  For the 1984 model year, to split the model line from the full-size Town Car, the Mark VI was replaced by the Mark VII, shifting the Mark series into the mid-size segment. While marketed as a personal luxury car, the Mark VII sought a role as the technology flagship of Ford Motor Company, featuring a number of comfort, convenience, and performance options introduced during the 1980s. Along with power accessories and leather seating, the Mark VII featured keyless entry, digital instruments, and an onboard computer/message center. The Mark VII was notable for becoming the first vehicle in North America sold with aerodynamic composite headlights after legislation permitted their sale in the United States; in addition, electronic 4-channel anti-lock brakes were sold first on the Mark VII (November 1984, six months before the Chevrolet Corvette). In a shift from the full-size segment, the Mark VII was derived from the Fox platform, becoming a two-door counterpart of the 1982‚Äì1987 Lincoln Continental sedan. The Mark VII was closely related to the 1983‚Äì1988 Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar sharing the doors, windshield and much of the unibody structure but with a longer wheelbase towards the rear. To end the marketing confusion seen since 1969, the Continental Mark VII became the Lincoln Mark VII for 1986. The Mark VII is the final version offered with Designer Editions (Gianni Versace, 1984‚Äì1985; Bill Blass, 1984‚Äì1992) and the first with the sport-tuned LSC (Luxury Sports Coupe). Mark VIIs were manufactured at the Wixom Assembly Plant in Wixom, Michigan through 1992.  Seventh generation (Mark VIII; 1993‚Äì1998)  Released for the 1993 model year, the Lincoln Mark VIII continued the role of the Mark VII as a luxury-oriented grand touring coupe. Slightly larger than its predecessor, the Mark VIII was sized nearly halfway between the Mark VI and the Mark VII in length (with its wheelbase only an inch shorter than the Mark VI coupe). Despite its larger footprint, the curb weight of the Mark VIII remained essentially the same as its predecessor. As the Mark VIII remained a mechanical counterpart to the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar, the Mark Series ended the use of the Fox platform in favor of the all-new FN10 platform (a Lincoln-exclusive variant of the MN12 platform). With its wheelbase stretched to 113 inches (only an inch shorter than the much larger Ford Panther platform), much of the extra interior space was given to the rear seat. In a major change, the Mark VIII was given independent rear suspension, exclusive in rear-wheel drive four seat American cars at the time (except for the Thunderbird and Cougar). The Mark VIII received a minor exterior redesign for the 1997 model year with a larger grille and exterior lights. As with its predecessors, the Mark VIII was assembled at Ford's Wixom, Michigan assembly plant. LSC The 1996 LSC model got 10 hp (7.5 kW) more, true dual exhaust, lower (3.27) gearing and other luxury features. The 1996 LSC was the first car from an American automaker to be equipped with HID headlights, and the 1997 to 1998 models continued the groundbreaking lighting trend with even larger housings for the HID system, and an innovative neon third brakelight across the entire rear decklid. Branding For its entire production run, the Continental Mark series was the most distinguished within the Ford Motor Company divisional hierarchy positioned above Lincoln. Following the discontinuation of the Continental Division in July 1956, the vehicles would remain marketed within the Lincoln-Mercury dealer structure. However, the vehicles themselves were not badged as Lincolns, nor did their identification plates, VINs, and factory paperwork bear the Lincoln division name. As the vehicles remained sold, serviced, and marketed by Lincoln-Mercury dealers alongside Lincoln Continentals, Continental was maintained as a separate marque for the Mark series vehicles, formally referred to as Continental Mark not Lincoln Continental Mark. As the Continental Mark series became more popular, the Lincoln name became colloquially affixed although the Lincoln nameplate did not appear on Continental Mark series vehicles nor did Lincoln Continental Mark appear in marketing, brochures, advertising and window stickers. The only exception to this was the referral of the 1960 Mark V as a Lincoln Continental Mark V in brochures and advertising in preparation for the Continental nameplate to become a sole model series under the Lincoln brand for 1961. Beginning with the 1981 model year, all manufacturers were required to use a 17 character VIN-code. The first three digits is the World Manufacturer Identifier which indicates the country of origin and make of a vehicle. 1981‚Äì1985 Continental Mark VI‚ÄìVII and 1982‚Äì1985 Continental 4-door sedans have the separate VIN-code 1MR which designates Continental as the make instead of 1LN as Lincoln (as is the Town Car). For the 1986 model year, the situation was clarified by Ford Motor Company marketing as the Continental Mark VII was renamed the Lincoln Mark VII (the Mark VIII was always sold as a Lincoln). At this point all Lincoln Continentals and Mark VIIs were assigned the 1LN VIN-code to designate Lincoln as the make.  Continental star  After the Continental Division was integrated into the Lincoln-Mercury Division after the 1957 model year, its four-point star logo - the \\"Continental Star\\" - was brought with it. As of current production, the emblem (in various forms) has remained in use on both Mark-series and Lincoln vehicles since 1958.  Further use of name =MK9, MKR, and Mark X concept cars In the early 2000s, Lincoln produced two personal-luxury concept cars using the Mark Series name. The two-door MK9 (pronounced \\"Mark Nine\\") debuted at the 2001 New York International Auto Show. Intended to explore the Mark Series past the discontinued Mark VIII, the MK9 was a two-door sedan with rear-wheel drive and a DOHC V8 engine The styling of the MK9 influenced several later concepts, including the 2002 Continental concept and the 2003 Navicross. The use of letters to identify different models began during Ford's acquisition of British luxury marques Jaguar, Aston Martin, and to a lesser extent Swedish marque Volvo in the Premier Automotive Group. Letters were used to identify the Jaguar XJ, the Jaguar XK8, the Aston Martin DB7, and the Volvo S60 and Volvo XC70. In 2004, the last car to use the Mark Series name debuted at the Detroit Auto Show. The Mark X (\\"Mark Ten\\") was a two-seat convertible; a first for the Mark Series. Mechanically based on the 2002‚Äì2005 Ford Thunderbird, the Mark X added a power-folding retractable hardtop. Although its Thunderbird origins were apparent above the window line, much of the Mark X was restyled for a contemporary and modern appearance (rather than the retro styling seen on its Ford stablemate). In a break from Mark Series tradition, the Continental spare-tire hump on the decklid was left out of the design of the two concept cars. Another concept car was introduced in 2007, called the Lincoln MKR. It was a premium four door fastback sedan based on the Ford Mustang platform which influenced the design themes of production Lincolns for a number of years. Mark LT (2005‚Äì2008) After the discontinuation of the Blackwood after a single year of production in 2002, Lincoln stayed out of the pickup truck market for three years. In 2005, the division tried again with the Lincoln Mark LT. As with the Blackwood, the Mark LT was based on the crew- cab version of the F-150; a major change from the Blackwood was the availability of all-wheel drive and the use of a conventional pickup box. After the 2008 model year, the Mark LT was rebadged as the Platinum trim level of the Ford F-150 in the United States and Canada, remaining for sale only in Mexico until 2014. Lincoln MK naming scheme During the 1990s, American luxury brands such as Lincoln lost market share to German and Japanese brands. As Lincoln and Cadillac began modernizing their lineups during the early 2000s, they both began to adopt alphanumeric naming schemes used by their competitors. At Lincoln, this started with the 2000 LS, which created some objections by Toyota, the owners of Lexus. As the LS and the Continental were both discontinued in the mid-2000s, the division introduced a new alphanumeric naming scheme that would partly revive the Mark Series. From 2007 to 2015, all newly introduced Lincolns would wear the \\"MK\\" (pronounced \\"emm kay\\") designation; the lone exceptions were the Town Car and the Navigator. After the 2011 model year, the Navigator became the sole non-MK Lincoln as the Town Car sedan was discontinued. However, for 2017 Lincoln discontinued the MKS and brought back the Continental name for its all-new flagship sedan. Since then Lincoln has brought back names for successive model replacements. In popular culture A 1971 Continental Mark III was featured in the 1971 film The French Connection, being driven by its villain Alain Charnier. The fictional detective Cannon drove a Continental Mark III, and later a Continental Mark IV, on the TV series of the same name. A 1977 Continental Mark V was used in the 1996 Alanis Morissette music video for her song \\"Ironic.\\" A 1978 Continental Mark V was driven by Ewing family patriarch Jock Ewing, played by Jim Davis, on the TV series Dallas. Additional Marks were used by other characters later on including J.R. Ewing, played by Larry Hagman, who replaced his Cadillac Allante with a Mark VII in the show's final season. A 1979 Continental Mark V was driven by car dealer (Knots Landing Motors owner) Sid Fairgate, played by Don Murray, in the first season of the TV series Knots Landing. A 1993 Lincoln Mark VIII was driven by drug dealer Rodney Little (Delroy Lindo) in the 1995 crime drama Clockers.

It was released by Sh-K-Boom Records on June 28, 2005 to generally positive critical reception. Amazon.com named it as one of its ten Editors' Picks in Broadway and Vocal Albums for 2005. The album contains songs written by Brown between 1996 and 2004, many of which he wrote independent of any musical. Before the release of the album, some of these songs were played at his live concert performances. Similarly to his other works such as Songs for a New World, the album covers a diverse blend of musical genres including rock, gospel, funk, and jazz. Brown sings his own music throughout the album; he is joined by Lillias White on \\"Coming Together\\" and a chorus (featuring a number of Broadway performers) on several of the songs. Many instrumental parts are performed by his band, the Caucasian Rhythm Kings. In addition to writing and singing, Brown also orchestrated, arranged, and played piano on ten of the album's eleven songs.  Previously unreleased songs  The album contains a few songs which had not previously been released commercially, but which nevertheless were known by Jason Robert Brown's fans. \\"Someone To Fall Back On\\" was originally recorded on The Inaudible Jason Robert Brown, an album that Brown distributed only to family and friends. The song also appeared in some of Brown's live performances. The song eventually made its way into the film Bandslam, directed by Todd Graff. This slightly faster rock-pop version was sung by Aly Michalka. \\"I Could Be In Love With Someone Like You\\" was originally a part of the musical The Last Five Years, but it was replaced with the similar song \\"Shiksa Goddess\\" after the musical's first run, because a lawsuit forced Brown to significantly change the female character described in the song.

He is widely known as \\"Jacob the Jeweler\\" or \\"King of Bling\\".  Early life  Arabo was born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. As a youngster he had an interest in his family's jewelry and time pieces. At age 16, he discontinued his formal education before completing high school and enrolled in a six-month jewelry-making course, which he graduated four months later. By the time he was 17 years old he was designing his own pieces in his own jewelry factory near New York City's diamond district.  Career  Initially selling his pieces from a kiosk in the Kaplan Jewelry Exchange (in the heart of New York City's Diamond District), by the age of 21, Arabo had officially started his own company, called Diamond Quasar, and began designing his own Jacob & Co. branded jewelry. Although he started out offering moderately priced, traditional jewelry, Arabo's design sense soon caught the eyes of celebrities, singers, and artists in the hip-hop and rap music world. In the early 1990s his clientele and business grew, and Arabo became known as \\"Jacob the Jeweler,\\" the moniker first appearing in rap songs by Jay-Z, Nas and other rappers. In 2005 he relocated to a \\"mine-inspired\\" storefront on East 57th Street. The townhouse space is adorned with Arabo's signature five- time-zone watches.  Conviction  In June 2006, Arabo was arrested on charges of money laundering and conspiracy in connection with the Detroit- based Black Mafia Family, as well as for not declaring large cash purchases to the IRS. In October 2007, after admitting to lying to investigators, Arabo and his attorney, Ben Brafman, entered a plea in which the more serious charges of money-laundering were dropped. In June 2008, Arabo was sentenced to two and a half years in prison, fined $50,000, and ordered to forfeit $2 million to the U.S. government. Arabo was released from jail in April 2010. Awards Jacob & Co.'s watch, \\"The World is Yours\\", was a 2006 Travel + Leisure Design Award winner. In popular culture Arabo was featured in the 2004 video game Def Jam: Fight For NY, in which the players' hip-hop characters compete to earn cash with which they can buy jewelry from Jacob the Jeweler. He is also well known in the entertainment industry for his unique jewelry designs and is mentioned in several hip-hop songs as \\"Jacob the Jeweler\\" or just \\"Jacob\\" In 2020, Arabo made a cameo appearance in Drake's \\"When To Say When & Chicago Freestyle\\" music video. Personal life Arabo married his wife, Angela -- who is also Bukharian Jewish -- when he was 24. The couple lives in Forest Hills, Queens, in a brick Colonial house they bought for $1.17 million in 1999.

He played in 15 Test matches between 1899 and 1909 and visited England as a player and team manager on four occasions. An accomplished photographer and author, he wrote an illustrated account of his 1899 and 1905 tours of England, An Australian Cricketer on Tour.Frank Laver, CricInfo. Retrieved 2020-02-01.Laver, Frank (1905). An Australian Cricketer On Tour. Chapman & Hall. Cricket career The son of Jonas Laver, grazier and timber merchant, and Mary Ann, n√©e Fry, Frank Laver was the 78th player to represent Australia. He was a right-hand batsman and right-arm medium pace bowler. In his first season with the East Melbourne Cricket Club, as a gangling six-footer from the country, he took 94 wickets and made three centuries, and held his place in the club for 25 years. In the 1892/93 season he scored more than 1000 runs for his club, including a record 352 not out. Batting with his friend and fellow Test player Peter McAlister in 1903/04 season, Laver scored 341 in a club record score of 2 for 744 in one afternoon's batting. Laver and McAlister later fell out over the management of overseas tours. Pollard described Laver as \\"crude and unorthodox, [who] could thrash even classy attacks. He was a plucky fieldsman whose bowling was highly suited to the heavy atmosphere and damp pitches of England.\\" His first Test match was between Australia and England at Trent Bridge, Nottingham on 1 to 3 June 1899. This match, the first to be played at Trent Bridge, was drawn with England needing 135 runs to win and Australia requiring 3 wickets. Laver's contribution was a modest 3 runs in each innings and a catch. The match was also notable as being W. G. Grace's last Test, and the first for Victor Trumper and Wilfred Rhodes. Laver's fortunes turned in the next Test match, at Lord's in London, where his three wickets in the second innings clinched an Australian victory by 10 wickets. Frank Laver c. 1905 In the 1905 tour of England, Laver was appointed player-manager by the Australian Board of Control, and finished second in the bowling averages, taking 115 wickets at an average of 18.19. Pollard described him as \\"a cricketer of character and perception, [who] could encourage aspiring players to great heights.\\" He was again appointed player-manager for the 1909 tour of England. At the end of the tour Laver refused to produce his records of the trip, insisting that he kept books only for the players' benefit. In the Test match at Old Trafford, Manchester on 26 to 28 July 1909, Laver had, in Wisden's words \\"a great day against England\\", taking 8 wickets for 31 runs in the first innings. \\"English batsmen considered him a very good but not an exceptional bowler, and often wondered why they fared so badly against him\\", said Wisden. This was a record performance in a Test match at Old Trafford, equalled by Fred Trueman in 1952, until Jim Laker's extraordinary 10 for 53 and 9 for 37 in 1956. Laver's last Test match was between Australia and England at The Oval, Kennington, London on 9 to 11 August 1909, another drawn match with England needing 208 runs with 7 wickets in hand. Laver was 8 not out in his only innings, and took 0 wickets for 13 runs in 8 overs. When another manager was appointed to lead the Australians to England in 1912, six senior players declared that they were unavailable unless Laver was reinstated. The Board of Control remained unmoved and, in spite of a heated selectors' meeting in which punches were thrown, Laver remained out favour with the Board. \\"Any suggestion that the players could have a free hand in selecting the manager was so much poppycock\\", declared Moyes. However, he managed a non-Test tour of New Zealand in the 1913/14 season. Altogether, Laver played 163 first-class matches in his career between 1891 and 1914. His nephew Jack Laver played 13 first-class matches for Tasmania between 1946 and 1952. Baseball career Laver was a prominent baseball player and member of first ever Australia national baseball team. He participated in the 1897 Kangaroo Tour of the United States, which was the first time an Australian baseball team had played in the US.http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/laver-frank-jonas-7742 He went on to become the president of the Victorian Baseball League (1915‚Äì19)http://baseballvictoria.com.au/Portals/34/2019/2017-18%20Annual%20Report.pdf and vice-president of the Victorian Baseball Union. He was recognised for his contribution to Australian baseball with his induction into the Baseball Australia Hall of Fame in 2005. Personal life He married Katie Myrtle Adele Major at Kiama, New South Wales in 1914, and had two children. He died of a cerebral haemorrhage. At the time of his death he was living in Kew, Victoria and his occupation was given as a manufacturer. See also * His brother Rudolph Laver ReferencesSources * Moyes, A.

Generally speaking, owning, or renting, land or a building includes the right to use and develop the space above the land without interference by others. This legal concept is encoded in the Latin phrase Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos (\\"Whoever owns the soil, it is theirs up to Heaven and down to Hell.\\"), which appears in medieval Roman law and is credited to 13th-century glossator Accursius; it was notably popularized in common law in Commentaries on the Laws of England (1766) by William Blackstone; see origins of phrase for details.  Air travel  Property rights defined by points on the ground were once believed to extend indefinitely upward. This notion remained unchallenged before air travel became popular in the early 20th century. To promote air transport, legislators established a public easement for transit at high altitudes, regardless of real estate ownership.Paris Convention of 1919 (Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation, Oct. 13, 1919, 11 L.N.T.S. 173) and the Pan American Convention on Commercial Aviation, U.S.-Cuba, Feb. 20, 1928, see 47 Stat. 1901) New technologies have again raised questions about ownership of \\"space\\" and the upward bounds of national sovereignty. With the advent of space travel above earth's atmosphere, the height at which national sovereignty extends and therefore nations can regulate transit is often debated. United States A building is cantilevered over two other buildings in New York City In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has the sole authority to regulate all \\"navigable airspace\\", exclusively determining the rules and requirements for its use.49 U.S.C. 180, 49 U.S.C.A. 18, ¬ß 40103 \\"use of airspace\\" Specifically, the Federal Aviation Act provides that: \\"The United States Government has exclusive sovereignty of airspace of the United States\\" and \\"A citizen of the United States has a public right of transit through the navigable airspace.\\" The \\"navigable airspace\\" in which the public has a right of transit has been defined as \\"the airspace at or above the minimum altitudes of flight that includes the airspace needed to ensure safety in the takeoff and landing of aircraft.\\" The exact altitude(s) at which the airspace over private land can become subject to \\"substantial impairment\\" is often debated. Case law in the past has used the height of in urban or suburban areas,Lacey v. United States 595 F.2d 614 (Fed. Cir. 1979) and above the surface or tallest structure in rural areasCausby v U.S. 75 F.262 Ct.Cl (1948) as the demarcation of where impairment of property rights can occur. At those times this constituted the limits of \\"navigable airspace\\". However, the bulk of more recent decisions, which take precedent, hold that taking can occur regardless of if the flight occurred within navigable airspace or not and only impairment of property need be considered.Branning v. United States 654 F.2d 88 (Fed. Cir. 1981) Held a taking occurred from air travel inside of navigable airspace (600') The present case is a case, as the court foresaw in Aaron v. United States, 160 Ct.Cl. at 301, 311 F.2d at 801, in which \\"the unavoidable damage [reduction of the highest and best use] to a person's property occasioned by [the noise created during] travel in the navigable air space [is] so severe as to amount to a practical destruction of it.\\" This is a case of first impression in which the court may consider the altitude of the flights over the property, but must give primary consideration to the effect of aircraft noise where the Government itself has adopted and published standards of compatibility of use of the subjacent property. Since the subjacent property owner has suffered a diminution of the value of the property in this case, there has been a taking of an easement over and through the airspace subjacent the property of the plaintiff. It is abundantly clear that under the law established by Causby, Griggs, and Aaron a taking has occurred in this case. This is especially important as some aircraft (manned and unmanned) now have no minimum flight altitudes making virtually all airspace \\"navigable\\". Financial compensation is owed property owners when the use of their property is substantially impaired by the federal governmentUS v. Causby 328 U.S. 256 or by state government,Griggs v. Allegheny County, 369 U.S. 84 or by the aerial trespasser.Argent v. U.S. 124 F.3rd 1277,1281 (1997) citing many[10]. Brown v United States 3 F.3d 1100 Ct Cl. (1996). also Branning v. U.S., 654 F.2d 88, 97-8 (1981) Congress has provided authority for the FAA to provide funds to purchase property interests in airspace (navigation easements) near airports to accommodate planes taking off and landing.49 U.S.C ¬ß 40110 The low cost of unmanned aerial vehicles (also called drones) in the 2000s re-raised legal questions regarding whose permission is required to fly at low altitudes: the landowner, the FAA, or both. There has never been a direct challenge to the federal governments vesting of the right for citizens to travel through navigable airspace. As such, the status quo is only permission from the FAA (through regulation) is required. However, existing property rights over private property still allow for civil claims of taking when property use is \\"substantially impaired\\" by the use of the airspace.Branning v. United States, 654 F.2d 88, 97-98 (Ct. Cl. 1981, Aaron v. United States, 311 F.2d 798, 801 Ct. Cl. (1963); Brown v United States 3 F.3d 1100 Ct Cl. (1996). The FAA has also reiterated that it has sole authority to regulate this right.  Railroads and air rights  Railroads were the first companies to realize the potential of making money from their air rights. A good example of this is Grand Central Terminal in New York City, where William J. Wilgus, chief engineer of the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, devised a plan to earn profit from air rights. At first, the railroad simply constructed a platform above the rail yards to allow for the development of buildings overhead. By 1954, the railroad began to realize it could sell more air rights and Grand Central Terminal was proposed to be replaced by a 50-story tower. This is how the Pan Am Building came to be built next to the station, after public protest regarding the demolition of Grand Central Terminal. This approach has been used in Chicago since the construction of the Prudential Building in 1955 above active railroad tracks of the Illinois Central Railroad. In 2017, to the west of the Chicago River, River Point and 150 North Riverside were built above tracks leading to the Amtrak station. Building on platforms over railroad tracks is still potentially very profitable. In the mid-2000s, New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) attempted to sell air rights to the New York Jets so that they could build the West Side Stadium over Manhattan's West Side Yard, near Penn Station, as part of the Hudson Yards Redevelopment. The Hudson Yards mega-development was eventually built over the rail yard. In Brooklyn, the Barclays Center and Pacific Park have been constructed over Atlantic Yards.  Roads and air rights  Similar to railroads, builders of highways have proposed selling their air rights; Boston did this in connection with the Big Dig. The city of Los Angeles funded a $100,000 feasibility study RFP in January 2007 to explore building a freeway cap park in Hollywood. The park would be built above US highway 101 and contain of new parkland.¬ª Community-Wide Hollywood Central Park Meeting  Air rights in development  The owner of the land has the exclusive development rights in the 'space' above his lands. Under common law, building a 'hangover' that breaks the vertical plane of a neighbor's property is a trespass and the property owner has the right to remove the offending structure. The airspace is property and retains developmental rights which can be sold or transferred. Thus in a dense downtown area, each building in the area may have the right to thirty-five stories of airspace above his own property. In one possible scenario, owners of an older building of only three stories high could make a great deal of money by selling their building and allowing a thirty-five-story skyscraper to be built in its place. In a different scenario, a skyscraper developer may purchase the unused airspace from an adjacent landowner in order to develop a broader building. In November 2005, Christ Church in New York sold its vertical development rights for a record $430 per square foot, making more than $30 million on the sale for the right to build in the space over its building.

They found success in Rio de Janeiro, performing as Natalicio and Antenor Lima and dressing in ceremonial Indian costumes. Using classical guitars and playing transcriptions of classical violin and piano works, they were soon playing all over South America. Probably as early as 1943, RCA's Latin American arm signed them to a recording contract. In the early 1950s, they took a break from performing and went back to study the guitar. After returning to the stage later that same decade, they took on the name \\"Los Indios Tabajaras\\" and released an album in the United States on an RCA-owned label Vox. Throughout this period, they had a steady stream of releases on RCA in Mexico and one of these, a Mexican popular tune named \\"Mar√≠a Elena\\" (Lorenzo Barcelata; named after the wife of a Mexican president and recorded in 1958), became a steady seller, a success throughout Latin America and was finally released on a single in the U.S. in 1963. It spent 14 weeks on the Hot 100 in the fall of 1963, four of which were in the top 10 in November 1963, reaching number 6 and had similar success in the United Kingdom. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. Los Indios Tabajaras continued touring throughout the Americas and Europe, and in 1964 they had another two releases, \\"Always in My Heart\\" and \\"Marta.\\" Although \\"Always in My Heart\\" made the Billboard Hot 100, neither of these were nearly as successful as \\"Maria Elena.\\" Their fluent guitar playing caught the ear of American guitarist Chet Atkins and, along with pianist Floyd Cramer, they recorded an instrumental album in Nashville, Tennessee. They also recorded and released material with singer Don Gibson, including a re- recording of Gibson's 1958 hit \\"Oh Lonesome Me\\". RCA released albums by Los Indios Tabajaras into the 1980s. They were produced by Herman Diaz, Jr. until his retirement in 1975. They then worked with RCA producer Ethel Gabriel. Antenor retired from performing in 1979, and died in 1997. Natalicio continued to perform into the 1990s with his wife, Michiko. He died in November 2009.

History Christchurch Girls' High School was established in 1877, four years before Christchurch Boys' High School. The first headmistress was Mrs. Georgiana Ingle (a daughter of Richard Deodatus Poulett-Harris and half-sister of Lily Poulett-Harris). The second principal Helen Connon (later Helen Macmillan Brown) is better known as she was the first woman in any British university to gain an Honours degree. The school's original building on Cranmer Square, which was renamed the Cranmer Centre, features prominently in the 1994 film Heavenly Creatures based on the 1954 Parker‚ÄìHulme murder case involving two students. The school featured in national and international news in 1972 when two students led a \\"walkout\\" from school assembly to protest the inclusion of religion in school morning assemblies. At the time, schools in New Zealand were supposed to be secular but this was largely ignored and students were usually told to bring a note from their parents if they wanted to opt out of the religious component of school assemblies. In June 2020, students complained that posters they had put up promoting the Black Lives Matter movement were removed without adequate explanation. Students reported that some staff had said the posters could damage the walls, but that other posters were allowed to remain, while the staff member who took the posters down reportedly said it was because \\"all lives matter\\". The incident followed similar complaints at two other New Zealand schools, where students had alleged racist motivations for removing posters. Prime MInister Jacinda Ardern, commenting on the issues across the three schools, said that the matters were for schools to deal with, but she did not discourage the students' actions, while Massey University sociologist Paul Spoonley said it was censorship and appeared to be \\"institutional racism ‚Äì racism that has come from the school itself\\". Present day Christchurch Girls' High School, known to many as Girls' High or CGHS, provides boarding facilities for 95 students from years 9 to 13 at Acland House, located 20‚Äì30 minutes walk away from school. The school stands by the Avon River, on a site it has occupied since 1986. Previously, the area was occupied by a mill that was first built in 1861 by William Derisley Wood, which became known as the Riccarton Mill. The February 2011 Christchurch earthquake had a large impact on the school: it caused extensive damage to the current site;Structural Inspection Report ‚Äì 24 June 2011 the old Cranmer Centre site was damaged so badly that it was later demolished ‚Äì and the school's principal at the time, Prue Taylor, lost her husband Brian in the CTV Building collapse. CGHS was the first school to go into lock down during the Christchurch mosque shootings at approximately 1:52pm on 15 March 2019. The current principal is Christine O'Neill, who started the role in July 2019.

It was broadcast for the first time by the IRIB on Thursday 10 September 2002 until Thursday 10 January 2003. It could usually be seen every night at 8:00 p.m. Tehran time on Tehran TV, also known as Channel 5 in Iran. Later due to the popularity of the show, episodes were shown in syndication on various Iranian provincial channels as well as IRIB 1 & IRIB 2 for those living out of the country. It was directed by Mehran Modiri. Summary of the Story On Tiptoes's episodes mostly dealt with the situations that Farhad (Mehran Modiri), an architect living in Tehran would end up in along with members of his family and friends. Farhad was originally from a fictional village in Iran, named Barareh. He had moved to Tehran, when he had been accepted into university. He eventually settled in Tehran and married a woman named Mahtab (Sahar Zakaria). The real story though begins when Farhad's cousin, Davoud (Javad Razavian) moves to Tehran from Barareh to find a job. Davoud has very little in terms of education, and still carries a thick accent, showing his Barareh roots. Farhad's sister, Shadi(Sahar Valad-Beigi) also has come to Tehran to begin her studies in university. Toghrol, an old man who hates anything related to Barareh is a friend of Mahtab's family, and helps maintain the property which Farhad and his wife live on. Farhad and Davoud are often the recipients of severe beatings from Toghrol. Davoud finds employment at the engineering company Farhad works at. Davoud has to be the tea-boy because of his poor educational background. Davoud slowly starts reminding Farhad of his village's culture and ways, which often would give hilarious results. Davoud would eventually marry Yasaman, and soon after Mahtab's brother would become a cast member, eventually marrying Farhad's sister.  Related series  Shabhaye Barareh is the prequel to On Tiptoes. Shabhaye Barareh is set in Barareh and describes Farhad's family more than fifty years ago. The series also has many of the cast members from other Modiri works such as Noghtechin, and Jayezeye Bozorg. In On Tiptoes Modiri plays the role of Farhad, and Shir Farhad(Farhad's father). In Shabhaye Barareh, Modiri is playing the younger version of Shir Farhad. Shabhaye Barareh also features Toghrol, showing him to have had a military career in his youth, hence his strict behaviour and attitude.

On February 26, 2007, Jenkins signed a four-year, $16 million contract extension.\\"Defensive lineman Jenkins extended by Packers\\", Associated Press, February 26, 2007. Retrieved on April 20, 2008. Jenkins batted down nine passes in 2007, the most by a Packers defensive lineman since the team began recording the statistic in 1980. He also finished 2007 with 26 total combined tackles and one sack. In the 2008 season, the Packers decided to start Jenkins rather than Gbaja-Biamila for the second season in a row. He could only play four games though, before he suffered a torn pectoral muscle against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on September 28, 2008. Two days later, he was placed on injured reserve. During his injury-shorted 2008 year, Jenkins had 13 tackles, 2.5 sacks, a pass defended, and a forced fumble. In the 2009 season, Jenkins returned as a starting defensive end because the Packers had switched from a 4-3 to a 3-4 defense. Jenkins started all 16 games in 2009 with 32 tackles, 4.5 sacks, a pass defended, an interception, and three forced fumbles. In the 2010 season Jenkins missed five games with a calf injury. He appeared in 11 games (started six) with 18 total combined tackles, seven sacks, and one pass defended. Jenkins was part of a major role of the Packers' 3-4 defense during their postseason run where they eventually won Super Bowl XLV, their first world championship in 14 years. Philadelphia Eagles The Philadelphia Eagles signed Jenkins to a five-year, $25 million contract on July 30, 2011.Eagles sign Cullen Jenkins In 2011, he recorded 5.5 sacks, 24 hurries, and seven tackles-for-loss. He agreed to a restructured contract on February 21, 2012, with the new contract running through the 2014 season instead of the 2015 season. On February 25, 2013, the Eagles declined his roster bonus, making him a free agent. New York Giants On March 10, 2013, Jenkins was signed to a three-year contract by the New York Giants. Washington Redskins On August 29, 2016, Jenkins signed a one-year contract with the Washington Redskins. After playing one preseason game, he was released on September 3, 2016. He re-signed with the team on September 13.

The first Seal of the County of Los Angeles was established in 1887 and has been changed three times since then. It is used on official county documents, vehicular decals, on buildings, and is displayed on the bear-top shield badge worn by uniformed county officers. It is also featured prominently on the county's flag. The current seal was adopted in 2016 and is identical to a design initially adopted in 2004. Design The current form of the seal, adopted in January 2014, portrays an image of a Native American woman, representing the early inhabitants of the Los Angeles Basin, surrounded by six smaller iconic images, with three on each side. The words ‚ÄúCounty of Los Angeles, California‚Äù surround the seal. The woman stands on the shore of the Pacific Ocean with the San Gabriel Mountains and the sun in the background.About Los Angeles County On her right, there are the engineering instruments of a triangle and a caliper (representing the industrial construction complex of the county and its vital contribution to the exploration of space), a Spanish galleon (specifically Juan Rodr√≠guez Cabrillo's ship the San Salvador, which sailed into San Pedro Harbor on October 8, 1542), and a tuna (representing the fishing industry). On her left, the images of The Hollywood Bowl (representing the County's cultural activities) with two stars above it (to represent the motion picture and television industries), the Mission San Gabriel Arcangel (representing the historic role of the missions in the settlement of the Los Angeles region), and the championship cow Pearlette (representing the dairy industry). History The 1957 to 2004 Los Angeles County seal affixed to the side of an L.A. County Fire Department vehicle in 2005 as it responds to a Louisianan town to assist in post-hurricane disaster recovery efforts. First seal: 1887-1957 The original 1887 county seal displayed grapes, surrounded by the words \\"Board of Supervisors ‚Äì Los Angeles Co. Cal.\\" Second seal: 1957-2004 Former L.A. County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn designed a new seal, which was drawn by Millard Sheets, and adopted by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on January 2, 1957, effective March 1, 1957. It included an image of Pomona, the Roman goddess of fruit trees, and the symbols of a cross and oil derricks. Third and fifth seal: 2004-2014, 2016-present In 2004, the seal was altered. A short time later, on May 25, 2004, the ACLU alleged that the seal's cross (a reference to the Hollywood Cross) was a violation of the Establishment Clause of the Constitution. The Board's new seal had also voluntarily eliminated Pomona and the oil derricks, without references by the ACLU. In the current seal, the stars and an image of the Hollywood Bowl (originally in the middle right column, also where the cross was originally placed) replaced the oil towers. The cross was removed, and replaced with an image of the Mission San Gabriel Arcangel. Some official L.A. County buildings and older county vehicles still use old seals, probably due to lack of effort in removing the seals. Uniformed county officers issued badges before 2004 did not receive new badges when the seal was updated, and thus continue to wear the older design. Occasionally, when a new seal is adopted, old ones may continue to be used until they are no longer usable due to wear, as in Mississippi's case when it adopted a new state seal in 2014. Fourth seal: 2014-2016 On Tuesday, January 7, 2014, the Board of Supervisors voted 3-2 to put a cross back on top of the mission depicted on the County seal, stating that it more correctly reflected the history of the San Gabriel Mission. The cross on the mission was removed during renovation. The ACLU of Southern California expressed opposition, alleging the action would violate both the Californian and United States Constitution.L.A. County supervisors vote to return cross to county seal, Pasadena Star-News, January 8, 2014 A federal lawsuit was filed against Los Angeles County on February 6, 2014. Critics of the change, including Supervisor Sheila Kuehl, stated that the time and money spent defending the county seal was wasted when there were many other issues requiring the Board of Supervisors' attention. Kuehl proposed replacement of the seal with a graphic of a seal as an April Fools' Day joke.https://supervisorkuehl.com/sup-kuehl-proposes-new-county-seal-end-of- controversy/ In April 2016, the addition of the cross to the seal was ruled unconstitutional by U.S. District Court Judge Christina A. Snyder. The county accepted the ruling. As part of the court order, the 2014 seal was covered up at County sites and replaced with the 2004 seal, and badges, uniforms, and materials printed with the 2014 seal were removed and replaced with those depicting the 2004 seal.http://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/bos/bc/1005896_ValidationofReplacementoftheCountySealinUse.pdf#search=%22county%20seal%22 See also *Flag of the City of Los Angeles *List of U.S. county and city insignia ReferencesFurther reading * External links * Category:Los Angeles County, California Category:Official seals of places in California ","title":"Seal of Los Angeles County, California"},{"id":"3556222","text":"Paul Mark Urlovic (born 21 November 1978) is a New Zealand professional footballer who plays as striker for Central United FC in the NRFL Premier Division.

He was one of Gotti's closest lieutenants. Biography Locascio was born to first generation immigrants from Baucina, Sicily. Becoming a made man during the 1950s, Locascio was a bookmaker and loanshark for the Gambino family. Later on, he was promoted to caporegime of a crew in the Bronx, New York. After the December 1985 assassination of boss Paul Castellano, Gotti became the new Gambino boss and Locascio joined his inner circle. When underboss Joseph Armone went to prison in 1987, Locascio became acting underboss; When Gotti reshuffled his administration later on, promoting Salvatore \\"Sammy the Bull\\" Gravano to Armone's position, Locascio became acting consigliere. 1992 conviction On December 11, 1990, Locascio was arrested alongside Gotti and Gravano and indicted for racketeering. At the time of his arrest, Locascio was still publicly identified as the Gambino family's underboss. At this time, Gravano decided to become a government witness and testified against his former associates. On April 2, 1992, Locascio was convicted on racketeering and conspiracy charges, as was Gotti. On June 23, 1992, both Gotti and Locascio were sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. When asked to comment at his sentencing, Locasico made the following remarks: ‚ÄúFirst, I would like to say emphatically that I am innocent... I am guilty though. I am guilty of being a good friend of John Gotti. And if there were more men like John Gotti on this earth, we would have a better country.\\" Gambino captain Joseph \\"Jo Jo\\" Corozzo later replaced Locascio as consigliere. As of December 2011, LoCascio is imprisoned at the Federal Medical Center Devens in Massachusetts. He has no projected release date. In \\"Underboss,\\" the tell-all tome by Salvatore (Sammy the Bull) Gravano, describes an incident in which Locascio, in prison with Gotti and Gravano in 1991, gave him a stolen orange before offering one to Gotti. Gotti became furious and loudly belittled Locascio in front of other inmates. Later, Gravano said, a humiliated Locascio tearfully vowed to murder Gotti, stating, \\"The minute I get out, I'm killing this [expletive].\\" Gravano says he and Locascio then made a pact to kill Gotti at a victory party, assuming they were somehow acquitted. \\"Frankie said, 'Sammy, two things. I'll bring him to the party myself, and I got to be the shooter,' \\" Gravano says in \\"Underboss. According to law enforcement sources and court papers, an infuriated Gotti, who was serving a life sentence in Marion, Ill., reached out to the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang to kill Locascio. Sources said they believe that two members of the white supremacist group were used in 1994 by one of Gotti's associates in a murder-for-hire contract. At some point, federal prison officials in Marion allegedly caught Gotti complaining about the Locascio passage on video cameras, a source said. Without identifying Gotti, prison officials said in court papers \\"a possible 'contract' has been put on Locascio's life by his former Mafia associates. Popular culture In the 1996 television movie Gotti, Locascio is portrayed by actor Raymond Serra. In the film Witness to the Mob, Locascio is portrayed by actor/singer Frankie Valli.

He served two terms as the 18th Mayor of Los Angeles, California. Early life Workman was born in New Franklin, Missouri, the son of David Workman (1797‚Äì1855) and Nancy Hook (1807‚Äì1888). He had two older brothers, Thomas H. (1832‚Äì1863) and Elijah H. (1835‚Äì1906). William, named for his uncle William Workman (1799‚Äì1876), a well-known rancher, farmer and banker in Los Angeles County, was raised in Howard County, Missouri, until the age of 15. David Workman ran a saddlery in Missouri for many years; an apprentice in the mid-1820s was Christopher \\"Kit\\" Carson, who ran away from the Workman business and later became a famed scout and mountain man in New Mexico. David opened a store in Gold Rush-era Sacramento; following a fire that destroyed seven-eighths of the city and destroyed the business, David journeyed south to visit his brother William Workman and was convinced to resettle in the Los Angeles area. In April 1854, the David Workman family, including 15-year-old William, crossed the plains to California. While resting and restocking supplies at Salt Lake City, the family was approached by Brigham Young, leader of the Mormons, about staying there. The family declined and moved on, arriving at William Workman's Rancho La Puente in October. David ran sheep and cattle to the gold mines for his brother, the elder William, but was killed in an accident in late June 1855, falling off a cliff while searching for a stray animal. After his death, David's widow Nancy and her sons moved to Los Angeles, residing on Main Street. Thomas went to work as secretary for noted transportation magnate Phineas Banning, married Alice Woodworth, and died in the explosion of the steamer Ada Hancock in April 1863, leaving no children. Elijah, following the family profession, opened a saddlery in Los Angeles by 1857 and was joined by William shortly afterward. The two continued in partnership for most of the next twenty years, building up, as the Workman Brothers, a substantial business at their Main Street location. William married Maria Elizabeth Boyle (1847‚Äì1933) on October 17, 1867, in Los Angeles. Maria was born in New Orleans, but after her mother died when she was young, was raised for a time by relatives while her father, Andrew A. Boyle (1818‚Äì1871) relocated to San Francisco. Not long after sending for his daughter, Boyle moved to Los Angeles, buying a tract of land east of the Los Angeles River called \\"Paredon Blanco\\" (White Bluffs). Boyle ran a shoe store and also the existing vineyard at Paredon Blanco, as well as served on the City Council during the 1860s. William H. Workman and Maria Boyle had seven children, including Boyle Workman. Political career Workman served several terms on the Los Angeles Common Council, between 1872 and 1880, and was a proxy delegate at the 1872 Democratic National Convention in Baltimore. During his council tenure, he was on the committee that planned the city's first high school, which opened in 1873. He served two terms as Mayor of Los Angeles from December 14, 1886, to December 10, 1888. He was a conservative Democrat at a time of Republican dominance of politics in the growing city. His mayoral term, lasting the two years of 1887 and 1888, occurred during the years known as the \\"Boom of the Eighties,\\" during which several parks, including today's MacArthur Park, were established and a new city hall was built. He was also instrumental in overseeing the revision of the city charter and the transfer of the mayor's duties as city judge to a separate judicial figure. He also served on the city parks commission in the 1890s, when several major parks, including Westlake, Eastlake [now Lincoln] and Hollenbeck, donated by him and Elizabeth Hollenbeck in memory or Mrs. Hollenbeck's husband and Workman's real estate partner, John, in the Boyle Heights neighborhood, and others were created.William H. Workman at LMU He was the treasurer of the city for three terms from 1901 to 1907. During his three terms as treasurer, he assisted in the transfer of municipal water control from private to public ownership and initiated the financial dealings for the early stages of the monumental Los Angeles Aqueduct project. Boyle Heights Workman inherited valuable and productive vineyards and orchards from his father-in-law, Andrew A. Boyle. After Andrew Boyle's death, Workman decided, during the first development boom of the city, which took place from 1868 to 1875, to subdivide much of Paredon Blanco and create the community of Boyle Heights. In spring 1875, the announcement was made publicly, but the collapse of the local economy the following year stunted the growth of Boyle Heights until a new development boom in the late 1880s. By the end of the 19th century, Boyle Heights was a premier residential area of town. Later, it developed into one of the city's most diverse communities and was home to a unique mix of Latinos, Jews, Molokan Russians, Italians, Japanese and other ethnic and religious groups. After the 1950s, the neighborhood became primarily Latino and especially attracted new migrants from Mexico and Central America. The recent opening of the extension of the Metro Gold Line has been welcomed by both optimism for a renewal of the aging community and concern about the loss of its Latino identity through gentrification. In between and after political office-holding, Workman maintained a successful real estate office for many years, was president of the American Savings Bank, and continued to work until his death. William H. Workman died at age 79 of heart failure at his home in Boyle Heights.Los Angeles Times, Mar. 14, 1901, \\"Many Will Mourn His Passing. --- William H.

Situated on Montju√Øc hill at the end of Avinguda de la Reina Maria Cristina, near Pl Espanya, the museum is especially notable for its outstanding collection of romanesque church paintings, and for Catalan art and design from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including modernisme and noucentisme. The museum is housed in the Palau Nacional, a huge, Italian-style building dating to 1929. The Palau Nacional, which has housed the Museu d'Art de Catalunya since 1934, was declared a national museum in 1990 under the Museums Law passed by the Catalan Government. That same year, a thorough renovation process was launched to refurbish the site, based on plans drawn up by the architects Gae Aulenti and Enric Steegmann, who were later joined in the undertaking by Josep Benedito. The Oval Hall was reopened in 1992 on the occasion of the Olympic Games, and the various collections were installed and opened over the period from 1995 (when the Romanesque Art section was reopened) to 2004.

It is one of the largest museums in Spain. History The history of this institution dates back to the 19th century, when, in accordance with the principles that inspired Catalonia's cultural and political Renaixen√ßa (renaissance), a movement particularly active in that century, many projects were launched to help revive and conserve the country's artistic heritage. This process began with the establishment of the Museu d'Antiguitats de Barcelona (Barcelona Museum of Antiquities) in the Chapel of St Agatha (1880) and the Museu Municipal de Belles Arts (Municipal Fine Art Museum) in the Palau de Belles Arts (1891), a palace built to mark the occasion of the 1888 Universal Exhibition. A project to install all these Catalan art collections in the Palau Nacional, launched in 1934 under the initiative of Joaquim Folch i Torres, the first director of Catalonia Museum of Art, was frustrated by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939), when for protection many works were transferred to Olot, Darnius and Paris (where an important exhibit was established). During the postwar period, the 19th- and 20th-century collections were installed in the Museu d'Art Modern, housed from 1945 to 2004 in the Arsenal building in Barcelona's Parc de la Ciutadella, whilst the Romanesque, Gothic and baroque collections were installed in the Palau in 1942. The Palau Nacional, which has housed the Museu d'Art de Catalunya since 1934, was declared a national museum in 1990 under the Museums Law passed by the Catalan Government. In 1992 a thorough renovation process was launched to refurbish the site, based on plans drawn up by the architects Gae Aulenti and Enric Steegmann, who were later joined in the undertaking by Josep Benedito. The Oval Hall was reopened in 1992 on the occasion of the Olympic Games, and the various collections were installed and opened over the period from 1995 (when the Romanesque Art section was reopened) to 2004. The Museu Nacional d‚ÄôArt de Catalunya (Museu Nacional) was officially inaugurated on 16 December 2004. Since 2004, the Palau Nacional has once more housed several magnificent art collections, mostly by Catalan art, but also Spanish and European art. The works from that first museum have now been enriched by new purchases and donations, tracing the country's art history from early medieval times to the mid-20th century: from Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and baroque to modern art. This heritage is completed by the Gabinet Numism√†tic de Catalunya (coin and medal collections), the Gabinet de Dibuixos i Gravats (drawings and engravings) and the library. Collections Apse of Sant Climent de Ta√ºll, a fresco from Church of St. Climent de Ta√ºll  Romanesque Art  Majestat Batll√≥ Frontal from La Seu d'Urgell or of The Apostles It is one of the most important and outstanding collections in the museum, due largely to the series of mural paintings it includes. Indeed, the Museu Nacional Romanesque Collection is unmatched by that of any other museum in the world. Many of the works here originally adorned rural churches in the Pyrenees and other sites in Old Catalonia, or Catalunya Vella, as it is known; they began to be discovered and studied in the early 20th century, particularly after a Pyrenean expedition in 1907 by the Institut d'Estudis Catalans (Institute of Catalan Studies), which later published Les pintures murals catalanes (Catalan Mural Paintings). Years later, the news emerged that a group of foreign financiers and antiquarians had block-purchased most of these paintings to be taken to the United States of America. Although there were no laws in Spain at that time to forbid the expatriation of art, the Junta de Museus (Catalan Board of Museums) was able to successfully intervene in order to rescue, dismantle and transfer works to the Museum of Barcelona (1919‚Äì1923), then housed in the Parc de la Ciutadella, thus conserving and protecting these Romanesque works, considered a completely unique piece of art heritage and also a symbol of the birth and formation of Catalonia. The Romanesque rooms are arranged in chronological and stylistic order, giving visitors a view of the different tendencies in Catalan Romanesque art and featuring works produced, for the most part, in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries. The visit to this section begins with the mural paintings from Sant Joan in Bo√≠, which show clear stylistic influences from the French Carolingian tradition, and then continues with works showing the Italian influence that dominated painting from the late 11th century, doubtless as a result of the influence of the Gregorian Reform. This style is illustrated in such excellent works as the mural paintings from Sant Quirze de Pedret, Santa Maria d'√Äneu and Sant Pere del Burgal. However, the rooms of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya also feature a particularly outstanding example of European Romanesque art: the remarkable, original and extraordinarily expressive paintings from the Apse of Sant Climent de Ta√ºll, including the famous Pantocrator or Christ in Majesty, an undisputed masterpiece from the 12th century that forms tangible evidence of the creative power of Catalan painting. Beside this superb piece stands another magnificent group of works, from Santa Maria de Ta√ºll, the most important example of the interior of a Romanesque church painted throughout, with much of its decoration conserved today. The Romanesque section ends with the paintings from San Pedro de Arlanza and the chapter house of Sigena. The latter features one of the most magnificent pictorial series in this new style, called 1200 art, which swept across Europe in the 13th century. The piece has been conserved in the museum since it was severely damaged by fire in 1936, during the Spanish Civil War. Romanesque rooms also show the techniques that distinguished Catalan art at the time, such as panel painting, wood carving and others that help to complete our aesthetic vision of Romanesque, such as precious metalwork and carving stone. The collection of panel paintings, unique in Europe, is another singular aspect of Romanesque painting, due both to the number and antiquity of the Catalan works conserved (the result of interest in the Romanesque since the late19th century) and to their quality and technical diversity. Particularly outstanding are the frontals of the Apostles (also known as the Frontal of La Seu d'Urgell), Al√≤s d'Isil, Avi√† and Cardet, which are rightly considered paradigms of an original pictorial technique, embodying enormous artistic interest. Moreover, the wood carving collection completes this wide-ranging summary of Romanesque art, featuring fine works of different types, such as Virgin of Ger, the Batll√≥ Majesty and the carvings in the Erill la Vall Descent from the Cross. There are also sculptures in stone that form part of the Museu Nacional Romanesque art collection, particularly a number of works from Ripoll and a large group of elements from ensembles in the city of Barcelona, including the refined marble capitals from the former Hospital de Sant Nicolau. Finally, the Romanesque section also features an important collection of enamels, mostly produced in Limoges, such as the Mondo√±edo Crosier.DDAA. El Rom√†nic a les col¬∑leccions del MNAC.

The Gothic collection features a considerable number of Catalan works accompanied, moreover, by an extraordinary selection of pieces from the other territories that were once ruled by the Crown of Aragon. As a whole, this section presents a broad, representative panoramic view of Gothic art produced in the three large peninsular territories that formed part of the kingdom of Aragon ‚Äì Catalonia, Aragon itself, and Valencia ‚Äì as well as a more anecdotal selection of works from Majorca. The Gothic rooms display works from the late 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, arranged in chronological order, although the pieces are also grouped by school and typological affinity, and several thematic sections have been established. These include the renowned Mural paintings of the Conquest of Majorca, which preside over the first Gothic room. This same room also contains other works on profane themes or from secular sites, including elements from the enteixinats (coffered ceilings) of noble Barcelona houses to amatory caskets. Other works in this and the following rooms, from Castile, Navarre, Aragon and Catalonia, clearly illustrate the predominance of French Gothic models, which endured until the mid-14th century, when competition was finally offered by new Italianate models. This new style, developed in the Italy of Giotto, was adopted and adapted here, working a profound transformation in painting and sculpture not only in Catalonia, but throughout the reigns forming part of the Crown of Aragon. Besides a few Italian examples, the Museu Nacional also features an important selection of Italian, Catalan and Aragonese painting, such as the Triptych of Sant Vicen√ß d'Estopany√†, probably by an immigrant Italian artist, and altarpieces by the Serra brothers (the Serra family were highly influential in steering the course of Catalan painting during the closing decades of the 14th century). Sculpture during this period from the mid-14th century, was also influenced by Italian models, although the French Gothic style continued to exercise its authority. The collection includes works that may be attributed to some of the most outstanding sculptors of the time, such as Jaume Cascalls (see Head of Christ) and Bartomeu de Robi√≥. Catalan sculpture in the late 14th century and the first half of the 15th is represented by two misericords from Barcelona Cathedral carved stalls by Pere Sanglada. From the 15th century, working in the new International Gothic style, Pere Oller and Pere Joan perhaps represent the peak of what was without doubt an important Catalan contribution to sculptural art. Amongst Catalan painters, Llu√≠s Borrass√†, Joan Mates, Bernat Martorell, Ramon de Mur and Joan Antig√≥ are amongst the finest exponents of International Gothic, a style that also coincided with the period when Valencia was flourishing as a centre for art. Valencia is represented in the Museu Nacional by such outstanding artists as Gon√ßal Peris. The Gothic collection also features examples of painting from Aragon, another region that enjoyed considerable influence at this time. The exchange of influences continued, in both directions, during the period that followed when artistic representation became more realistic, and which took its initial inspiration from Jan van Eyck: the Valencian artist Llu√≠s Dalmau painted the universally acclaimed Virgin of the Consellers whilst the Catalan Joan Reixac ‚Äì whose work is well represented at the Museu Nacional ‚Äì directed the most prolific workshop in Valencia. It was also after a period in Valencia that Jaume Huguet, the great Catalan painter working in the second half of the 15th century, made his residence definitively in Barcelona, establishing his dominance and setting up a school there. Complementing a generous selection of Huguet's works, the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya also contains examples from artists active during the same period, such as Pere Garcia de Benabarre, who worked in both Aragon and Catalonia and created another successful formula based on similar cultural components. Besides this central strain in autochthonous painting, the panorama of Gothic art also features various other important episodes, such as the time spent by Antoine de Lonhy in Barcelona, or the later, longer residence in the Catalan capital of the Cordoban artist Bartolom√© Bermejo, who had previously worked in Valencia and Aragon. This journey through the late 15th century continues with such Castilian painters as Fernando Gallego, along with others from Aragon, as Mart√≠n Bernat or Miguel Xim√©nez, and Valencia, principally Roderic d'Osona. Finally, mention the remarkable series of the organ shutters from the Cathedral of la Seu d'Urgell, painted at the end of the 20th century by an artist from Perpignan who is known by various names, including that of the Master of La Seu d'Urgell.Gum√†, Montserrat (ed).

The itinerary begins with art from the Low Countries in the 16th century, in which religious fervour is mixed with detailed depiction of everyday life, as can be seen in the superb collection of panels and triptychs commissioned for private use. In Catalonia during the early Renaissance period, the Gothic forms are found alongside other, new stylistic solutions, as exemplified, for instance, in St Candidus, by Ayne Bru or St Blaise, by Pere Fern√°ndez, works imbued with the humanist feeling and influenced by the modern composition theories that were then emerging in Italy. In the Altarpiece of St Eligius of the Silversmiths, Pere Nunyes clearly shows the influence of this new language, as does the sculptor Dami√† Forment in his interpretation of the Apostles for the Dormition of the Virgin. Towards the end of the 16th century, Spanish painting produced many works of outstanding beauty, such as El Greco's The Bearing of the Cross and St Peter and St Paul, enriched by modern use of colour, the fruit of the lessons the artist had learned in Venice. In this age, the Ecce Homo, Luis de Morales, a contemporary of El Greco, Jacopo Tintoretto or The Bassano, masterfully conveyed the devotional spirit of the Counter- Reformation. The 17th century begins with the frescoes in the Herrera Chapel by Annibale Carracci and collaborators, who decorated the Church of San Giacomo degli Spagnuoli in Rome, and continues with works by other Italian artists such as the Neapolitans Massimo Stanzione and Andrea Vaccaro. However, standing out above all these are the masterpieces from the masters of the Spanish Golden Age, such as the Martyrdom of Saint Bartholomew by Jos√© de Ribera, known as Lo Spagnoletto, St Paul, by Diego Vel√°zquez, and the Immaculate Conception and several still lifes by Francisco de Zurbar√°n. Returning to Catalonia, in his image of St Cajetan, the sculptor Andreu Sala reveals himself to be a worthy follower of the Italian genius Bernini. Entering now the 18th century, Antoni Viladomat's series of canvases devoted to the Life of St Francis, which decorated the main cloister of the former monastery of the Friars Minor in Barcelona, constitutes the only complete set of scenes from monastic life preserved in a museum. Finally, heralding the art forms that would develop in the 19th century, the daring works of Francesc Pla, known as El Vigat√†, illustrate the painterly freedom taken when decorating the interiors of seigniorial mansions belonging to the new, wealthy classes who had made their fortunes in trade and industry. The collection, which reflects the taste of certain sections of society for Renaissance and Baroque art, features (exceptionally, if compared to the rest of the Museu Nacional collections) art produced not only in Catalonia, but also in the rest of Spain, Italy and Flanders, providing an overview of the development of European art during this period. Two later donations made important contributions to this more general vision: the Camb√≥ Bequest and the Thyssen- Bornemisza Collection.Gum√†, Montserrat (coord).

The Camb√≥ Bequest forms a collection of paintings embraces European painting history from the 14th to the early 20th century. It includes representative works of the Gothic and Renaissance periods, together with pieces that illustrate the perfection of the Italian Quattrocento, the sensuality of the great Venetian masters of the Cinquecento, the rising economic prosperity of the Low Countries in the 16th and 17th centuries and the magnificence of the Spanish Golden Age, without forgetting the richness of European Rococo. The artists represented at the Museu Nacional, thanks to this distinguished collection, include many outstanding, universally known names: great Italian painters such as Sebastiano dal Piombo, Tiziano Vecellio (Titian) and Giandomenico Tiepolo; superb exponents of the Flemish School in the form of Peter Paul Rubens and Lucas Cranach; Jean-Honor√© Fragonard and Maurice Quentin de la Tour and their French rococo works; and, finally, Francisco de Goya, whose revolutionary genius rounds off the artistic journey embraced by the Camb√≥ Bequest.

In that same year, 1993, the permanent exhibition of these works was officially opened in a wing of Pedralbes Monastery, converted into a museum by Barcelona City Council. In 2004, the Thyssen-Bornemisza Foundation and the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya reached an agreement under which the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection of Barcelona was to be exhibited permanently at the Museu Nacional, with the dual purpose of complementing the content in the Catalan museum and making the works more widely known and appreciated. The collection comprises paintings and sculptures spanning European art from the Gothic to the rococo period. There are many Italian works, including, most outstandingly, paintings by Fra Angelico, Pietro da Rimini, Taddeo Gaddi, Francesco del Cossa, Bernardino Butinone, Dosso Dossi, Titian, Ludovico Carracci, Tiepolo and Canaletto, among others. Particularly fine examples from the Flemish school are a painting by Petrus Paulus Rubens and a landscape by Salomon Jacobz van Ruysdael, whilst the Spanish Golden Age is represented by Diego Vel√°zquez's Portrait of Mariana of Austria.

This original core of the collection was considerably expanded by acquisitions made by the Council at art exhibitions. As it stands at present, the modern art collection contains a selection of the finest Catalan art from the early 19th century until the 1940s. The first part of this itinerary is devoted to the neoclassical, Romantic and realist movements. Among the most outstanding Catalan neoclassical artists represented here are the painter Josep Bernat Flaugier and the sculptor Dami√† Campeny. In terms of Romanticism, particular mention should be made of Nazarene painters such as Claudi Lorenzale, who focussed on the portrait most notably, and Llu√≠s Rigalt, a precursor of the Catalan landscape tradition, which was continued (now entering the Realist period) by Ramon Mart√≠ Alsina, who introduced Courbet's ideas in Catalonia, and Joaquim Vayreda, founder of the Olot School, among others. Special mention should also be made of Mari√† Fortuny, Catalonia's finest 19th-century painter. Fortuny's genre painting won him international acclaim, although towards the end of his short life he became interested in pictorial innovation, as can be seen in his last works. Also represented here are several painters who worked in the style of anecdotal realism, including Rom√† Ribera and Francesc Masriera, and the Luminists of the Sitges School, disciples of Fortuny. Turning now to sculpture, the Vallmitjana brothers are the most outstanding exponents of the realist tradition. Finally, the section devoted to the 19th century also includes examples from early photographic art, featuring works by A. A. Disd√©ri, Jean Laurent, Le Jeune and Charles Clifford, among others, featuring images of different places from all over Spanish territory.

In painting, the works most clearly identified with this movement, infused with a spirit of renewal, are those by Ramon Casas and Santiago Rusi√±ol, whose Parisian paintings embrace certain elements from French Impressionism. Another important trend is Symbolism, represented here by the paintings of Alexandre de Riquer and Joan Brull, and also seen in certain photographs by the pictorialist Pere Casas Abarca. The second generation of Modernista artists are present in depth and number, too, with works by the likes of Isidre Nonell, Mari√† Pidelaserra, Ricard Canals, Hermen Anglada‚ÄìCamarasa, Nicolau Raurich and Joaquim Mir, among others. It was these and other artists who helped to elevate Catalan painting to reach one of its most brilliant periods around the turn of the 20th century. The collection also includes works by Spanish painters, such as Julio Romero de Torres, Joaquim Sorolla, Ignacio Zuloaga, Dar√≠o de Regoyos and Jos√© Guti√©rrez Solana, the photographer Ortiz-Echag√ºe and the French artists Boudin, Sisley and Rodin. Particularly interesting in the section devoted to Modernista sculpture are the works of Miquel Blay and Josep Llimona, who were clearly influenced by Rodin. The collection of Modernista decorative arts includes some exceptional examples of interior decorative art by Josep Puig i Cadafalch, Gaspar Homar and Antoni Gaud√≠ from, respectively, the Amatller, Lle√≥ Morera and Batll√≥ houses in Barcelona's Passeig de Gr√†cia; objets d'art in various specialities, such as ironwork, ceramics, glasswork and jewellery; not forgetting several items of furniture by Joan Busquets and the architect Josep Maria Jujol.

The movement is represented by the classical compositions of Joaqu√≠n Torres Garc√≠a and Joaquim Sunyer, vaguely influenced by C√©zanne, and the sculptural nudes of Josep Clar√† and Enric Casanovas. Completing this review of Noucentisme are the sculptures by Manolo Hugu√© and the paintings by Xavier Nogu√©s, notably popular in tone. In around 1920, a new generation of artists emerged, one faced by the dilemma of either continuing in the figurative tradition or making the leap to the avant-garde. Some of these, such as the painters Josep de Togores and Francesc Domingo, produced work with a style of its own within the context of international realism, a movement that gained many followers between the wars. Others, such as Torres-Garc√≠a himself, Rafael Barradas and Salvador Dal√≠, found in the Galeries Dalmau the ideal gallery at which to show their more innovative works. The historic avant-garde is very well represented, particularly in terms of sculpture, with works including impressive sculptures by Pablo Gargallo, Julio Gonz√°lez and Leandre Crist√≤fol, whilst in painting the most exceptional figure is Pablo Picasso, represented in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya collection since 2007. Turning now to the field of photography, we should mention such avant-garde artists as Josep Masana, Josep Batlles, Pere Catal√† Pic and Emili Godes, as well as Agust√≠ Centelles for his important graphic work documenting the Spanish Civil War. Finally, the new avant-garde that emerged during the post-war years is represented by Otho Lloyd and Joaquim Gomis, whose pioneering work found its continuation in the Neorealists Francesc Catal√†-Roca, Joan Colom, Oriol Maspons and Xavier Miserachs, among others. = The Carmen Thyssen Bornemisza Collection = In late 2004, to mark the opening of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, the museum received a score of Catalan art works from the Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza collection. In view of the wealth and heterogeneity of this collection, the works loaned to the Museu Nacional focus more on diversity than on unity of discourse, with the object of giving an idea, if overly concise, of the plurality of this collection. The chronological period covered by this section spans from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century, one of the most brilliant moments in the history of Catalan art. Notable amongst the 19th-century pieces is Mari√† Fortuny's Bullfight, Wounded Picador, painted in 1867. As regards the Modernista movement, several of the most important artists from this period are represented, featuring Open-Air Interior (1892) and Ramon Casas and Pere Romeu on a Tandem (1897), both by Ramon Casas; Le Paon Blanc by Hermen Anglada-Camarasa; and The Cathedral of the Poor (in which the Church of the Sagrada Familia, under construction, is seen in the background) and The Abyss. Majorca (1901‚Äì1904) by Joaquim Mir. Equally noteworthy is the presence of Noucentisme, a movement deeply rooted in Catalonia, with paintings by Joaquim Torres-Garc√≠a and Joaquim Sunyer, as well as works by younger artists who continued the Noucentista spirit. Finally, this journey through the history of Catalan modern art leads to the acclaimed Antoni T√†pies. = Cabinet of Drawings and Prints = The collections assembled from the museum's historic holdings to form the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya Cabinet of Drawings and Prints comprise some 50,000 drawings, 70,000 engravings and more than 1,000 posters. The founds combine to offer a rich and wide-ranging journey through the most important movements in the history of Catalan art, particularly since the late 18th century, thanks largely to the establishment in Barcelona in 1775 of the Free School of Design and the Fine Arts. Popularly known as La Llotja, this school quickly became a reference point in the consolidation of the academic style in Catalonia. Representing the period from Neoclassicism to Realism, the Museu Nacional collections of works on paper feature a considerable number of pieces by artists linked to the school in the 19th century, including Josep Bernat Flaugier, Vicent Rod√©s, Claudi Lorenzale and Ramon Mart√≠ Alsina, as well as others by members of certain families, such as the Planella and the Rigalt lineages, who produced various generations of artists. From the preceding periods, we should highlight in particular the contribution made by the most outstanding Catalan baroque painter, Antoni Viladomat, who is represented by many works in the Cabinet of Drawings and Prints. As recently as 2003, moreover, the collection was enhanced by the acquisition of a group of Catalan baroque altar works from C√©sar Martinell's unique collection, which provide an interesting view of Catalan altarpiece art in the 17th and 18th centuries. However, there can be no doubt that one of the true highlights of these collections is the important body of works by Mari√† Fortuny, which include more than 1,500 drawings and 50 engravings, making the Cabinet of Drawings and Prints an essential reference for reconstructing the creative trajectory of this great 19th-century artist. From the same period, moreover, are more than 30 drawings by the history painter Eduardo Rosales, acquired in 1912, and linked to two of his finest and most characteristic historic compositions: The Testament of Queen Isabella the Catholic and the Death of Lucrecia. The Modernista and noucentista movements are also widely represented in the Cabinet holdings. The collections include more than 600 Modernista posters by renowned Catalan and foreign artists. Among the most impressive are those by Ramon Casas, one of the most illustrious of all Modernista artists. Particularly mention should be made of the famous series of charcoal sketches, a veritable portrait gallery of the leading personalities of the era in Catalonia, and which Casas himself donated to the museum in 1909. Turning now to the noucentista movement, we should draw attention in particular to Isidre Nonell, represented in the Cabinet by some 150 pieces. Nor should we forget the collection of posters from the same period, largely acquired by the museum from Llu√≠s Plandiura in 1903. Comprising more than 500 pieces among which foreign artists are also well represented, this invaluable legacy constitutes an incomparable resource for tracing the history of poster art in Catalonia. Finally, though the collection is rather uneven here, mention should be made of the printed works from the avant-garde movement. The sculptor Juli Gonz√°lez is one of the avant-garde artists most amply represented in the Cabinet, thanks to the donation of more than 150 drawings made by his daughter in 1972. On the other hand, the presence of certain great contemporary creative artists such as Dal√≠ and Mir√≥, to mention but two, is little more than anecdotal. Two acquisitions made by the old Museums Board were fundamental to forming the collections contained in the Cabinet of Drawings and Prints. The first was the collection of literary and art critic Raimon Casellas, in 1911; the second, that of Modernista artist Alexandre de Riquer, ten years later. = Numismatic Cabinet of Catalonia = The collections of the Numismatic Cabinet of Catalonia, established in 1932, now comprises more than 134,000 pieces. This rich holding is the result of a long process of acquisition by purchase, donation, legacy or deposit, which began in the first half of the 19th century and continues even today. The coin collection comprises nearly 100,000 pieces, including examples from the main series minted from the 6th century BC to the present. The most important and interesting amongst these are, without doubt, the coins produced in Catalonia, which include many extremely rare and unique pieces. The visit to the Numismatic Cabinet begins with the series of ancient coinage, outstanding among which are those minted on the Iberian Peninsula. These include such important pieces as the coins from the Greek colonies of Emporion and Rhode and the treasure of 897 silver pieces found at the neapolis of Emporion. Dating back to the transition period between the ancient and medieval worlds is the collection of Visigoth coins, including some minted at workshops in Catalan territory, such as Barcino, Tarraco or Gerunda. Practically all the western European kingdoms are represented in the medieval Christian series, although the collections of coins from Catalonia and Aragon are the most notable. They include examples that illustrate, step by step, the historic and economic evolution of these lands. For example, the economic growth that Catalonia enjoyed in the 13th century is reflected in the minting in Barcelona for the first time of silver Peter II Croats. Finally, among the coins minted in the modern and contemporary periods, we should mention particularly those produced in Catalonia during three important historic periods: the Reapers War, the War of the Spanish Succession and the French occupation. The medals collection is formed by more than 9,000 pieces, which range from the earliest, struck in Italy in the second half of the 15th century, to the present. The greater part of this collection is made up of works produced in Spain, mostly by well-known artists and engravers, who created medals of the highest quality. For example, the Museu Nacional medals collection features works by such outstanding 18th-century master engravers as Tom√°s Francisco Prieto and Ger√≥nimo Antonio Gil. During the late 19th century, moreover, particularly after the 1888 Barcelona Exhibition, many Modernista sculptors turned to the art of medal-making, and the examples in the Cabinet fully reflect what was a splendid creative period for the genre, particularly in Catalonia. The leading artist in the field was, without doubt, Eusebi Arnau, but such sculptors as Parera, Blay, Llimona and Gargallo also created medals of the highest quality. The central core of the MNC paper money collection, which embraces a wide range of documents of different types, is formed by its 4,100 examples of banknotes. These include the Spanish series containing all the banknotes issued by the Bank of Spain from 1874 to the present, as well as the series of paper money printed by the Catalan Government and local authorities in the country during the Spanish Civil War. The Cabinet also exhibits a range of different pieces of interest due to their direct or indirect connection with numismatics. These include, amongst other things, tools used for minting coin, coin weights, scales, jettons (counters), pellofes and other types of tokens, stamps, medals and various documentary collections. The building The National Palau of Montju√Øc, known as Palau Nacional was constructed between 1926 and 1929, with the goal of being the main building of the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition, holding an Exhibition of Spanish Art named El Arte en Espa√±a (The Art of Spain). More than 5,000 works came to the Exhibition from across Spain. The Palau Nacional is a huge building (over ) which embodies the academic classical style that predominated in constructions for all the universal exhibitions of the period. Its fa√ßade is crowned by a great dome inspired by St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican City in Rome, flanked by two smaller domes, while four towers modelled on Santiago de Compostela Cathedral stand at the corners of the so-called Sala Oval, or Oval Hall. This great space (2,300 m2), used as the venue for important civic and cultural events, is encircled by tiered seating, preceded by double columns; it also houses a monumental organ, one of the biggest in Europe, waiting for an important restoration work. Many of the most outstanding painters and sculptors of the day, for the most part followers of the Noucentista aesthetic and cultural movement, were commissioned to decorate the interior of the Palau. Entrance from the front is by a huge staircase leading up from Avinguda de la Reina Maria Cristina, flanked halfway by magnificent monumental illuminated fountains designed by Carles Bu√Øgas. Fountains in front of MNAC The first projects to develop the slopes of Montju√Øc, turning the mountain into the city's green lung and a leisure activity centre for the people of Barcelona, date back to the early 20th century. However, these ideas were given decisive momentum when Montju√Øc was chosen as the site for the great International Exhibition organised by the city in 1929. The renowned Modernisme architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch was commissioned to direct the urban development and architectural aspects of this project, and Juan Claude Nicolas Forestier and Nicolau Maria Rubi√≥ i Tudur√≠ landscaped the gardens. Under these plans, the Palau Nacional was to be the central palace for the exhibition. In 1923, the dictator Primo de Rivera seized power, with the result that Puig i Cadafalch was removed from the project. A competition to design and build the Palau Nacional was then won by the architects Eugenio P. Cendoya, Enric Cat√† and Pere Dom√®nech i Roura. The palace was to provide the central venue for a great exhibition entitled Art in Spain and featuring original works and reproductions representing the history of Spanish art, complemented by two extensions: the Poble Espanyol (Spanish Village) architectural site, still open today, and the Palau d'Art Modern (Palace of Modern Art), which was later demolished. In the area around the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya site, moreover, many of the buildings erected for the 1929 International Exhibition remain, whilst others have also been established. All these different elements form a complex that has become one of the most attractive cultural, commercial and leisure centres in the city. The outstanding buildings dating from the time of the International Exhibition include the pavilions housing the Barcelona Trade Fair (Fira de Barcelona), the Estadi Ol√≠mpic Llu√≠s Companys, refurbished for the 1992 Games, the Poble Espanyol and the Teatre Grec, a Greek amphitheatre built in a disused quarry. This gives its name to Barcelona's summer arts festival (GREC).  Library and archive  The library is the most important documentation centre open to the public. Its origins go back to the books referred to by museum technicians in Barcelona when preparing for the 1888 Universal Exhibition. In the early 20th century, the Junta de Museus (Museums Board) decided that the library should be opened to the public, and decisive impetus was given to this initiative when the Special Committee for the Library was set up in 1907. From that year onwards, the library holdings were constantly enriched by legacies and donations from important private libraries. The Museu Nacional Library collections comprise domestic and foreign books and magazines on different aspects of art: monographic works on art and artists; photography; numismatics; local history; a reserve section containing a collection of manuscripts; incunabula such as the 1493 Nuremberg Chronicle; works published pre 1900; and the books of artists and collector's editions. Sections of particular interest include that devoted to exhibition catalogues, established in 1913 and containing printed matter on shows held at galleries in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain and even further afield, and ‚ÄòThe Press‚Äô, established in 1968, which brings together news items published in the daily media and of interest to the artworld. It is thanks to the Museu Nacional publications policy, that many of these works were acquired ‚Äì it aims to promote exchanges and so provide the library with copies of works published by museums and art centres all over the world. The library facilities are designed to provide Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya technical staff, researchers, students, art professionals and all individuals interested in the art world with all the information they seek. The reading room provides access to the library catalogue, the Collective Catalogue of Universities (CCUC), several databases (Princeton University, Index of Christian Art; Bibliography of the History of Art; Art Price), and to databases available on CD-ROM and Internet. Another important element in the Museu Nacional organisational structure is the archive, founded as a department in 1995 to standardise management of the museum's documentary collections. With regard to the origin of these collections, the archive contains both documentation generated by the museum since 1991, when the consortium was set up, and historic documents from institutions that now form part of the Museu Nacional: the Museu d'Art de Catalunya (Art Museum of Catalonia), the Museu d'Art Modern (Museum of Modern Art), the Cabinet of Drawings and Prints, the Numismatic Cabinet of Catalonia, and the Library of Art History. The archive also conserves invaluable historic documentation in the form of the collections built up by different organising committees for fine art exhibitions (1891‚Äì1946). Here, too, are other historic resources related to the world of art and deposited in the museum over the years. Finally, the archive also contains a section devoted to the image, comprising some 350,000 audiovisual documents, mainly photographs, on different supports and in a variety of formats.The museum's library  Museum Network  The Victor Balaguer Museum The Museus secci√≥ are part of Museu Nacional but they go under an independent management and ownership is on the respective councils. Currently three entities comprise: * The Biblioteca Museu V√≠ctor Balaguer: Victor Balaguer Museum Library is located at Vilanova i la Geltr√∫ and was founded in 1884 by Victor Balaguer as a sign of gratitude to the city for support received in his political career. It has a gallery specializing in Catalan painting of the 19th and 20h centuries, including works by Santiago Rusi√±ol, Ramon Casas, Joaquim Vayreda, Ramon Mart√≠ Alsina, Dion√≠s Baixeras, Isidre Nonell, Rafael Durancamps and Xavier Nogu√©s, among others. It also features works from different periods of art history, with an Egyptian collection, pre-Columbian, Filipino, East, archaeological and decorative arts. It also has placed works of art from the Museo del Prado. * The Cau Ferrat: located in Sitges, near the beach of San Sebastian, was the home study of Santiago Rusi√±ol. It was opened as a museum in 1935, and exhibit several collections related to modernism and the artist. There is a large collection of iron, glass and ceramics. As for painting and drawing, man can see works of El Greco, Ramon Casas, Miquel Utrillo, Ignacio Zuloaga, Anglada Camarasa, Picasso and Dar√≠o de Regoyos, among others. One of the peculiarities is the same provision of the works. * The County Museum of la Garrotxa: located in Olot, specializes in Catalan painting and more specifically members of the School of Olot. One can view works by artists such as Ramon Casas, Xavier Nogu√©s, Leonci Quera, Ramon Amadeu, Miquel Blay and Josep Clar√† as well as a collection of Art Nouveau posters.  Educational activities  Educational space at the museum One of the other aspects of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya is the number of services and training proposals and entertainment for families and schools. The museum has an educational service itself, which offers several resources for learning and services tailored to different audiences. Among others, a program is the museum common space of integration aimed at people at risk of exclusion and use the museum as a key integrator and software Museum hosts, aimed at integrating with other training projects related to art. Another of the best known proposals is Museum as an integration space (El Museu espai com√∫ d'integraci√≥, in Catalan), and also A hand of stories (Una Ma de Contes), a joint initiative between Televisi√≥ de Catalunya and Museu Nacional, which explains 20 short stories representing 20 paintings of Museu Nacional permanent collection, with a different look. There are also activities which are encouraged in the relationship between children and artists active. They participated in activities such contemporary artists as Philip Stanton Gino Rubert or Llu√Øsa Jover.Tv3.cat Children Artists in the museum Accessed 04/08/2010  Restoration and Preventive Conservation Centre  Cleaning tests at the Conservation-Restoration Center of the museum The aim of the Department of the Restoration and Preventive Conservation is to ensure the conservation of all the works in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya collections. The Department helps to guarantee the physical conservation of all the museum's holdings, including both works on exhibition and in storage, on deposit or on loan, whilst also seeking to delay as far as possible the ageing process that affects the materials that form the artworks. In addition, the Restoration and Preventive Conservation Department also studies the materials and the technical aspects of works with a view to providing scientific and technical assistance for art historians specialising in different periods, promoting dialogue and interdisciplinary studies. At the centre, professionals from different specialist disciplines study problems affecting the works, or changes they are undergoing, determining the causes of deterioration and doing their utmost to eliminate any risk to the works. In this regard, a key aim is to create a stable environment and to establish the best conditions for exhibiting, storing, handling, packing and transporting works. The centre seeks to minimise deterioration to the collections by ensuring that the most appropriate environmental conditions and exhibition systems are provided, as well as exercising strict control over the movement of objects and the restoration treatments applied to individual works. Most of the activity at the centre is concerned with prevention, but due importance is also attached to reparative treatment and restoration. Restoration work is aimed at improving the aesthetic reading of pieces on which, very often, restorers from much earlier generations have previously intervened, working according to criteria very different from those applied today. Needless to say, restoration is not carried out in the hope of returning works to their original state; but rather, to take into account the passing of time and any work that has already been carried out on the piece, and which now forms part of the history of restoration in Catalonia in general. The center exists due to the impulse that Joaquim Folch i Torres gave to the project when he sent Manuel Grau i Mas in Milan with the objective that was formed by the hand of Mauro Pelliccioli, then director of the restoration laboratories in Milan, attached to the Pinacoteca di Brera art gallery. The Milan laboratories had a decisive influence on how restoration work was carried out all over Europe. Work continues today with a view to establishing the Museu Nacional Department of Restoration and Preventive Conservation as a reference and resource, which may operate separately from the museum itself, in terms both of the working methodologies and the rigour and the criteria that the centre applies. The centre is staffed by scientific personnel devoted to preventive conservation and chemical laboratory work, and by a team of curators and restorers specialising in various disciplines, in accordance with the types of works that form the museum collections: restoration of paint on canvas and transferred painted murals; paint on wooden panels; polychrome wood sculpture; furniture; artwork on paper and photography; and stone, metal and ceramic.

Description The Orchid Thief is based on Orlean's investigation of the 1994 arrest of John Laroche and a group of Seminoles in south Florida for poaching rare orchids in the Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve. The book is based on an article that Orlean wrote for The New Yorker, published in the magazine's January 23, 1995, issue. Plant dealer Laroche was determined to find and clone the rare ghost orchid for profit. Along the way, Orlean becomes fascinated with ghost orchids and meets many orchid enthusiasts. In their and Laroche's struggles and oddities, she gets a glimpse of true passion for the first time in her life. Reception The book received a mixed reception on publication. Most critics noted both the strength of the prose and the compelling subject, while some criticized the overall trajectory of the book. Positive reviews included that of Michael Pearson at the Atlanta Journal- Constitution who called it \\"a rare and exotic tale that shows a journalist's gifts in full bloom.\\" New York Magazine noted the \\"hilariously reported, discursive narrative wanders\\" in many directions, but saw that as a core strength of the work. Critical reviews tended to note the level of tangents in the story and lack of a structure suitable for a book of length. Ted Conover, in a mixed review for the New York Times, noted the giftedness of the storytelling, while noting that Orlean's structure often suffered in her first book-length effort. Writing for the Chicago Tribune, Kristen Lillegard was harsher, noting the lack of forward motion in a story that \\"wilt[ed] under the weight of facts and figures.\\" Film version: Adaptation (2002) The book was adapted by Charlie Kaufman for Spike Jonze's film Adaptation. (2002), with Nicolas Cage as Charlie Kaufman and his fictitious brother Donald, Tilda Swinton as Valerie Thomas, Meryl Streep as Orlean and Chris Cooper as Laroche. The film is a pastiche of the process of adaptation, in which a successful but self-loathing Kaufman painstakingly tries to make Orlean's book into a \\"simple movie about flowers\\" without the formulaic Hollywood tropes or the metaphysical stylings he was acclaimed for in his previous movie, Being John Malkovich. Kaufman struggles with writer‚Äôs block, has sexual fantasies of Orlean and has enlightening discussions with other writers that lead him to ultimately make the script-within-the-film about the film itself, blending his metaphysical stylings to formulaic Hollywood tropes such as narration to communicate his neurotic thought process and a thriller-tinged third act to \\"wow the audience\\". In the film, Orlean is depicted as a sad writer with no fascination until she meets Laroche and has an affair with him. He introduces her to a drug extracted from the ghost orchid that makes the world fascinating and she keeps seeing him after he posted pictures of her naked online. When Kaufman becomes curious about the affair, he gets caught spying on the pair and Orlean wants Kaufman dead to save her reputation. That leads to the thriller sequence of the film in which Donald and Laroche are killed and Orlean is arrested. Kaufman lives to tell the tale and finishes the script.

Best known for his ghost thriller, Nang Nak, he is generally credited as the leader among a \\"New Wave\\" of Thai filmmakers that also includes Pen-Ek Ratanaruang, Wisit Sasanatieng and Apichatpong Weerasethakul. Biography=Education Nonzee is a relative of Lieutenant General Phachoen Nimitbutr (‡πÄ‡∏ú‡∏ä‡∏¥‡∏ç ‡∏ô‡∏¥‡∏°‡∏¥‡∏ö‡∏∏‡∏ï‡∏£), Director of the Signal Department of the Royal Thai Army and the founder of Thailand's first television station, Army TV Channel 5. Nonzee graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in visual communication design from the Faculty of Decorative Arts at Silpakorn University in 1987. Classmates included Wisit Sasanatieng and production designer Ek Iemchuen. He started his career as a director of television commercials and music videos. First films He made his feature-film debut with 1997's Dang Bireley's and Young Gangsters, with a screenplay by Wisit Sasanatieng. The story was set in 1956 in Bangkok and follows the adventures of a gang of young criminals, with the action showing the influence of John Woo films. It was named best picture at the Thailand National Film Awards and was nominated for a Dragons and Tigers Award at the Vancouver International Film Festival. His next film was Nang Nak, a thriller based on a popular Thai ghost story, also scripted by Wisit. A famous ghost story that has been depicted in many Thai films and television series, the story is about a husband comes home from war and takes up living with his wife and newborn son who, unbeknownst to him, have died while he was away. The moodily framed horror film won numerous awards, including best picture at the Thailand National Film Awards. Both Young Gangsters and Nang Nak were hits at the box office and were credited with reinvigorating the Thai film industry. Pan-Asian production With his third film, Jan Dara, Nonzee began a trend of pan-Asian film production in the Thai industry, bringing in Hong Kong actress Christy Chung to star in the erotic drama. He also sought funding from studios outside Thailand. Ahead of its release, Jan Dara was controversial because its sexual subject matter, involving incest, rape and abortion, tested the bounds of Thailand's 1930 Censorship Code. The film was released with the board's cuts for the film's commercial run in Thailand, but it was available uncut for film festivals. Nonzee also became quite active as a producer, putting his name on such films as Bangkok Dangerous by the Pang Brothers; Tears of the Black Tiger by Wisit Sasanatieng; the historical battle epic, Bangrajan by Thanit Jitnukul and Pen-Ek Ratanaruang's Monrak Transistor. He co-founded his own production company, Cinemasia, with his production partner, Duangkamol Limcharoen. She died in 2003. Continuing on his path of pan-Asian production, Nonzee initiated the horror trilogy, Three, in which he and two other directors, Hong Kong's Peter Chan and Korean director Kim Ji-Woon, each directed a segment. Recent work While keeping busy as a producer, he directed 2003's OK Baytong, a topical, contemporary drama about a young man who must leave the Buddhist monkhood and go to Muslim-dominated southern Thailand to attend to the affairs of his sister, who was killed in a train bombing. In 2005, he directed a short film, The Ceiling for the Asian Film Academy, in conjunction with the Pusan International Film Festival. The 18-minute, English-language film starred South Korean actors is the story of a young writer who climbs into the crawlspace above her apartment and spies on the woman living next door.ThaiCinema.org, \\"Nonzee Will Teach Filmmaking in Korea\\" , October 8, 2005. His next film, Queens of Langkasuka, is an epic historical-fantasy involving pirates and three princesses who must protect their realm, Langkasuka.

A point was scored when one player touched the ground with his back, hip or shoulder, or conceding defeat due to a submission-hold or was forced out of the wrestling-area. Three points had to be scored to win the match. One particularly important position in this form of wrestling was one where one of the contestants was lying on his abdomen with the other on his back trying to strangle him (back mount). The athlete on the bottom would try to grasp an arm of the one on top and turn him over onto his back while the athlete on top would try to complete the choke without being rolled. Wrestling was the first competition to be added to the Olympic Games that was not a footrace. It was added in 708 B.C. (Miller, 46). The competitions were held in elimination-tournament style until one wrestler was crowned the victor. The wrestling area was one square plethron or stremma. This event was also part of the pentathlon. Wrestling was regarded as the best expression of strength out of all of the competitions and was represented in Greek mythology by Heracles. Famous wrestlers from antiquity Milo of Croton was one of the most famous wrestlers from this ancient time period. At one set of games, no one challenged him, but as he walked to the skamma he slipped and fell and was harassed by the crowd as they claimed he shouldn't be crowned because he fell. He contested that he should be crowned because he had only fallen once, two short of the required at least three times (Martin, 50). Leontiskos of Messene was also a noted champion. He was not known for his good wrestling skills, but for his superior finger bending skills. He was able to bend right up to the point of disqualification and won two championships with this technique (Martin, 50). Suda writes about the wrestler Kleostratos () of Rhodes who won a victory in wrestling by throttling his opponent.Suda, ¬ßtau.921 The wrestler Topsius () was the brother of the philosopher, Dio of

A comparison of apples and oranges occurs when two items or groups of items are compared that cannot be practically compared. The idiom, comparing apples and oranges, refers to the apparent differences between items which are popularly thought to be incomparable or incommensurable, such as apples and oranges. The idiom may also be used to indicate that a false analogy has been made between two items, such as where an apple is faulted for not being a good orange. Variants The idiom is not unique to English. In Quebec French, it may take the form (to compare apples with oranges), while in European French the idiom says (to compare apples and pears) or (to compare cabbages and carrots). In Latin American Spanish, it is usually (comparing potatoes and sweet potatoes) or commonly for all varieties of Spanish (comparing pears with apples). In some other languages the term for 'orange' derives from 'apple', suggesting not only that a direct comparison between the two is possible, but that it is implicitly present in their names. Fruit other than apples and oranges can also be compared; for example, apples and pears are compared in Danish, Dutch, German, Spanish, Swedish, Croatian, Czech, Romanian, Hungarian, Italian, Slovak, Slovene, Luxembourgish, Serbian, and Turkish. In fact, in the Spanish- speaking world, a common idiom is , that is, to add pears with apples; the same thing applies in Italian () and Romanian (). In Portuguese, the expression is (compare orange with banana).Olimp√≠adas: \\"Est√£o comparando banana com laranja\\", Gazeta do Povo, 15 October 2009 In Czech, the idiom literally means 'to mix apples with pears'. Not all apples are alike. Some languages use completely different items, such as the Serbian (comparing grandmothers and toads), or the Romanian (the grandmother and the machine gun); (the cow and the longjohns); or (the gypsy and the marker), or the Welsh (as different as honey and butter), while some languages compare dissimilar properties of dissimilar items. For example, an equivalent Danish idiom, means \\"What is highest, the Round Tower or a thunderclap?\\", referring to the size of the former and the sound of the latter. In Russian, the phrase (to compare warm and soft) is used. In Argentina, a common question is (What do love and the eye of an axe have in common?) and emphasizes dissimilarity between two subjects; in Colombia, a similar (though more rude) version is common: (to confuse shit with ointment). In Polish, the expression is used, meaning \\"What has (is) gingerbread for a windmill?\\". In Chinese, a phrase that has the similar meaning is (), literally meaning \\"horses and cattles won't mate with each other\\", and later used to describe things that are totally unrelated and incomparable. A number of more exaggerated comparisons are sometimes made, in cases in which the speaker believes the two objects being compared are radically different. For example, \\"oranges with orangutans\\", \\"apples with dishwashers\\", and so on. In English, different fruits, such as pears, plums, or lemons are sometimes substituted for oranges in this context. Sometimes the two words sound similar, for example, Romanian (apples with pears) and the Hungarian (the season with the fashion). Published comparisons=Scientific Oranges, like apples, grow on trees. At least two tongue-in- cheek scientific studies have been conducted on the subject, each of which concluded that apples can be compared with oranges fairly easily and on a low budget and the two fruits are quite similar. The first study, conducted by Scott A. Sandford of the NASA Ames Research Center, used infrared spectroscopy to analyze both apples and oranges. The study, which was published in the satirical science magazine Annals of Improbable Research, concluded: \\"... the comparing apples and oranges defense should no longer be considered valid. This is a somewhat startling revelation. It can be anticipated to have a dramatic effect on the strategies used in arguments and discussions in the future.\\" A second study, written by Stamford Hospital's surgeon-in-chief James Barone and published in the British Medical Journal, noted that the phrase apples and oranges was appearing with increasing frequency in the medical literature, with some notable articles comparing \\"Desflurane and propofol\\" and \\"Salmeterol and ipratropium\\" with \\"apples and oranges\\". The study also found that both apples and oranges were sweet, similar in size, weight, and shape, that both are grown in orchards, and both may be eaten, juiced, and so on. The only significant differences found were in terms of seeds (the study used seedless oranges), the involvement of Johnny Appleseed, and color. The Annals of Improbable Research subsequently noted that the \\"earlier investigation was done with more depth, more rigour, and, most importantly, more expensive equipment\\" than the British Medical Journal study. Economic On April Fools' Day 2014, The Economist compared worldwide production of apples and oranges from 1983 to 2013, however noted them to be \\"unrelated variables\\". In teaching the use of units While references to comparing apples and oranges are often a rhetorical device, references to adding apples and oranges are made in the case of teaching students the proper uses of units. Here, the admonition not to \\"add apples and oranges\\" refers to the requirement that two quantities with different units may not be combined by addition, although they may always be combined in ratio form by multiplication, so that multiplying ratios of apples and oranges is allowed. Similarly, the concept of this distinction is often used metaphorically in elementary algebra. The admonition is really more of a mnemonic, since in general counts of objects have no intrinsic unit and, for example, a number count of apples may be dimensionless or have dimension fruit; in either of these two cases, apples and oranges may indeed be added.

Although Toyota used this fuel injection system in gasoline engines years before, this is among the first diesel engines to adopt such a system. Although the basic construction is similar to a modern gasoline injector, the EFI system in 2L-TE utilize considerably higher injection pressures. The EFI system meter fuel with great precision and succeeded in increasing the engine's efficiency.To improve durability new piston design using alumina-silica ceramic fiber reinforced piston ring grooves, inplace of the cast iron insert normally used were introduced with the 2L-TE making it possibly one of the earliest aplications of Metal Matrix Composites. Like the 2L-T, it is and it is a SOHC (Single Overhead Cam) engine, having 8 valves. It also comes with a Turbo charger. The bore and stroke is .

He was a member of the All Blacks team that won the inaugural Rugby World Cup in 1987. Biography Fox was born in New Plymouth. He attended Auckland Grammar school. During his time with the All Blacks from 1985 to 1993, he wore the number 10 jersey (first five-eighth or fly-half), and was the main goalkicker for the All Blacks. He amassed 645 points from 46 All Black Test Matches (1 try, 118 conversions, 128 penalties, 7 drop goals). He is considered a true pioneer of the modern art of goal kicking,http://www.espnscrum.com/timeline/rugby/player/9902.html in particular the technicalities of leaning the ball forward, which has been adopted by world class kickers since. Many believe he is one of the greatest first five- eighths in All Black history, even though he was not a great runner with the ball in hand. Despite his relatively short height, he made up for this with fantastic distribution skills reinforced by his long-term colleague John Kirwan's then-world-record career statistics playing outside him for Auckland and the All Blacks. His inability to score tries was often a joking point in the team ‚Äì his cause not helped by an overruled attempt against Ireland in 1989 (due to a prior technical infringement by a teammate). Fox was a member of the New Zealand Cavaliers which toured apartheid South Africa in 1986, following the cancellation of the official NZRFU tour in 1985. For participating in the rebel tour Fox was banned from selection in the All Blacks for three tests. The highlight of Fox's career was winning the inaugural Rugby World Cup with New Zealand in 1987, a victory based in part on his accurate kicking. In the 1995 New Year Honours, Fox was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to rugby. Fox remained an integral part of his Auckland club, involved at a coaching level and sharing in their success in the 1999 and 2002‚Äì2003 NPC seasons. Fox is now a commentator on Sky Sports, NBC Sports and in the EA Sports rugby union series. Fox provided commentary on the Rugby World Cup on ABC in 1995, with Al Michaels in 1999 and 2003 and Mike Tirico in 2007.

Notovitch is known for his 1894 book claiming that during the unknown years of Jesus, he left Galilee for India and studied with Buddhists and Hindus before returning to Judea. Notovitch's claim was based on a document he said he had seen at the Hemis Monastery while he stayed there.McGetchin, Douglas T., Indology, Indomania, and Orientalism, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 2009, . p. 133: \\"Faced with this cross-examination, Notovich allegedly confessed to fabricating his evidence.\\" The consensus view amongst modern scholars is that Notovitch's account of the travels of Jesus to India was a hoax.New Testament Apocrypha, Vol. 1: Gospels and Related Writings by Wilhelm Schneemelcher and R. Mcl. Wilson (Dec 1, 1990) p. 84: \\"a particular book by Nicolas Notovich (Di Lucke im Leben Jesus 1894) ... shortly after the publication of the book, the reports of travel experiences were already unmasked as lies.

(2003). The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man: How Reliable is the Gospel Tradition?. Prometheus Books. p. 93. \\"It remains quite clear that Notovitch's Unknown Life of Jesus was a hoax.\\" Notovitch also wrote some political books on the role of Russia in war.La Russie et l'alliance anglaise: √©tude historique et politique. Paris, Plon-Nourrit, 1906.L'Europe √† la veille de la guerre. Paris A. Savine, 1890 Life of Saint Issa Notovitch's 1894 book La vie inconnue de Jesus Christ (Life of Saint Issa) claims that during his unknown years, Jesus left Galilee for India and studied with Buddhists and Hindus there before returning to Judea. Outline of the book Hemis Monastery in 2006 After breaking his leg in India and while recovering from it at the Hemis monastery in Ladakh, Notovitch learned of the Tibetan manuscript Life of Saint Issa, Best of the Sons of Men‚ÄîIsa being the Arabic name of Jesus in Islam, and ƒ´≈õa meaning 'the Lord' in Sanskrit. Notovitch's account, with the text of the Life, was published in French in 1894 as La vie inconnue de Jesus Christ. It was translated into English, German, Spanish, and Italian. Allegations of forgery and alleged confession Notovitch's book generated controversy as soon as it was published. The philologist Max M√ºller expressed incredulity at the account presented and suggested that either Notovitch was the victim of a practical joke or he had fabricated the evidence.Simon J. Joseph, \\"Jesus in India?\\" Journal of the American Academy of Religion Volume 80, Issue 1 pp. 161-199: \\"Max M√ºller suggested that either the Hemis monks had deceived Notovitch or that Notovitch himself was the author of these passages\\"Friedrich M. Mueller, Last Essays, 1901. (republished 1973). . Page 181: \\"it is pleasanter to believe that Buddhist monks can at times be wags, than that M. Notovitch is a rogue.\\" M√ºller wrote: \\"Taking it for granted that M. Notovitch is a gentleman and not a liar, we cannot help thinking that the Buddhist monks of Ladakh and Tibet must be wags, who enjoy mystifying inquisitive travelers, and that M. Notovitch fell far too easy a victim to their jokes.\\" M√ºller then wrote to the head lama at Hemis monastery to ask about the document and Notovitch's story. The head lama replied that there had been no western visitor at the monastery in the previous fifteen years, during which he had been the head lama there, and there were no documents related to Notovitch's story.Bradley Malkovsky, \\"Some Recent Developments in Hindu Understandings of Jesus\\" in the Journal of Hindu-Christian Studies (2010) Vol. 23, Article 5.:\\"M√ºller then wrote to the chief lama st Hemis and received the reply that no Westerner had visited there in the past fifteen years nor was the monastery in possession of any documents having to do with the story Notovitch had made public in his famous book\\" ... \\"J. Archibald Douglas took it upon himself to make the journey to the Hemis monistry to conduct a personal interview with the same head monk. What Douglas learned there concurred with what Mueller had learned: Notovitch had never been there.\\" Other European scholars also opposed Notovitch's account and Indologist Leopold von Schroeder called Notovitch's story a \\"big fat lie\\". J. Archibald Douglas, who was a professor of English and History at the Government College in Agra, then visited the Hemis monastery to interview the head lama, who stated yet again that Notovitch had never been there and that no such documents existed. Wilhelm Schneemelcher states that Notovich's accounts were soon exposed as fabrications, and that to date no one has even had a glimpse at the manuscripts Notovitch claims to have seen. Notovich at first responded to claims to defend himself.D. L. Snellgrove and T. Skorupski, The Cultural Heritage of Ladakh, p. 127, Prajna Press, 1977. But once his story had been re-examined by historians, Notovitch is said to have confessed to having fabricated the evidence. Bart D. Ehrman, a Bible scholar and historian, says that \\"Today there is not a single recognized scholar on the planet who has any doubts about the matter. The entire story was invented by Notovitch, who earned a good deal of money and a substantial amount of notoriety for his hoax.\\" However, others deny that Notovich ever accepted the accusations against him. Fida Hassnain, a Kashmiri writer, has stated: > Notovitch responded publicly by announcing his existence, along with the > names of people he met on his travels in Kashmir and Ladakh. ... He also > offered to return to Tibet in company of recognized orientalists to verify > the authenticity of the verses contained in his compilation. In the French > journal La Paix, he affirmed his belief in the Orthodox Church, and advised > his detractors to restrict themselves to the simple issue of the existence > of the Buddhist scrolls at Hemis.Fida Hassnain. A Search for the Historical > Jesus from Apocryphal, Buddhist, Islamic & Sanskrit Sources. Gateway Books, > Bath, UK. 1994, p. 29. Although he was not impressed with his story, Sir Francis Younghusband recalls meeting Nicolas Notovitch near Skardu, not long after Notovitch had left Hemis monastery.The Heart of a Continent: A Narrative of Travels in Manchuria, Across the Gobi Desert, Through the Himalayas, the Pamirs, and Hunza (1884-1894), 1904, pp. 180‚Äì181. Claims of corroboration in India Pilgrims at Hemis Monastery Although Notovitch had been discredited in Europe, certain individuals in India considered his story to have credibility. Swami Abhedananda claimed to have visited the Hemis monastery in 1922 to verify the reports of Notovich that he had heard the previous year in the U.S. He claimed that lamas at the monastery confirmed to him that Notovich was brought to the monastery with a broken leg and he was nursed there for a month and a half. They also told him that the Tibetan manuscript on Issa was shown to Notovich and its contents interpreted so that he could translate them into Russian. This manuscript was shown to Abhedananda,Swami Abhedananda's \\"Journey Into Kashmir and Tibet\\" rendered into English by Ansupati Dasgupta and Kunja Bihari Kundu. which had 14 chapters, containing 223 couplets (slokas). The Swami had some portions of the manuscript translated with the help of a lama, about 40 verses of which appeared in the Swami's travelogue. The original Pali manuscript‚Äîallegedly composed after Christ's resurrection‚Äîwas said to be in the monastery of Marbour near Lhasa. After his return to Bengal, the Swami asked his assistant Bhairab Chaitanya to prepare a manuscript of the travelogue based on the notes he had taken. The manuscript was published serially in Visvavani, a monthly publication of the Ramakrishna Vedanta Samiti, in 1927 and subsequently published in a book form in Bengali. The fifth edition of the book in English was published in 1987, which also contains an English translation of Notovich's Life of Saint Issa as an appendix. Paramahansa Yogananda wrote that Nicholas Roerich also corroborated Notovich's and Abhedananda's story during his visit to Tibet in the mid-1920s. He also wrote that \\"records of Jesus's years in India were preserved in Puri, according to Bharati Krishna Tirtha, and that after leaving Puri Jesus spent \\"six years with the Sakya Buddhist sect in... Nepal and Tibet\\", before returning to Palestine. He added that \\"the overall value of these records is inestimable in a search for the historical Jesus\\".The Second Coming of Christ, Chapter 5 (Self-Realization Fellowship, 2004) Other authors' references Author Alice Dunbar Nelson includes a review of The Unknown Life of Jesus Christ in her 1895 collection Violets and Other Tales. In 1899 Mirza Ghulam Ahmad wrote Jesus in India (published in 1908) and claimed that Jesus had traveled to India after surviving his crucifixion, but specifically disagreed with Notovitch that Jesus had gone to India before then.J. Gordon Melton, The Encyclopedia of Religious Phenomena, 2007. p. 377Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, Jesus in India, (Jul 1, 2003) pages iv-v (publisher's note) Other authors have taken these themes and incorporated it into their own works. For example, in her book The Lost Years of Jesus: Documentary Evidence of Jesus' 17-Year Journey to the East, Elizabeth Clare Prophet asserts that Buddhist manuscripts provide evidence that Jesus traveled to India, Nepal, Ladakh and Tibet. In his book Jesus Lived in India, German author Holger Kersten promoted the ideas of Nicolas Notovich and Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. Gerald O'Collins classified Kersten's work as the repackaging of the same stories.Gerald O'Collins and Daniel Kendall, Focus on Jesus, Mercer Univ Press 1998. . pages 169-171 In his 2002 comedic novel Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal, absurdist author Christopher Moore parodies the notion that between the ages of 15 and 30, Jesus traveled to Tibet to study Buddhism in a monastery (after first having traveled to Afghanistan), then to India to study Hinduism. Other writings In 1906 Notovitch published a book in Russian and French, pleading for Russia's entry into the Triple Entente with France and England. It is entitled in French: La Russie et l'alliance anglaise: √©tude historique et politique. He also wrote biographies of Tsar Nicolas II and Alexander III.Nicolas Notovitch, L'empereur Nicolas II et la politique russe, Paris : P. Ollendorff, 1895.

Gilbert was born in Cherry Valley, New York. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War of 1846‚Äì48, he served in the US Army. After his regiment arrived in San Francisco, California in 1847, Gilbert was discharged from service and chose to remain in California. In 1849, Gilbert partnered with businessman Edward Kemble and printer G. O. Hubbard to found the Alta California weekly paper, where Gilbert worked as senior editor for the next four years. In September 1849, Gilbert became the youngest delegate to the Constitutional Convention, winning the San Francisco delegate position with 1,512 out of the 1,519 votes cast. He was elected in November 1849 at- large as one of California's first two Representatives in the 31st Congress, and served from September 11, 1850 until March 3, 1851. In 1852, Gilbert wrote an article that charged General James W. Denver with \\"negligence and gross mismanagement\\" in an expedition to aid destitute immigrants, and the increasing conflict between Gilbert and Denver finally led Gilbert to challenge him to a duel. After several missed shots from both men, Denver shot Gilbert in the abdomen, killing him. Gilbert was interred in Laurel Hill Cemetery, San Francisco. Later, after the city banned cemeteries within city- limits, his remains were removed and buried in the Laurel Hill Mound mass grave of Cyprus Lawn Memorial Park in Colma.

She was founder of the Blue Cross and diaconical centre in Star√° Tur√°. Her literary works were translated into 36 languages. During the reign of communist party in former Czechoslovakia, Christian literature written by her was among those frequently confiscated by state security service ≈†tB and at the same time she was blacklisted on the socialist era school curricula. She is now considered to be the Slovak author with the most frequently translated literary works and some literary critics regard her for being a \\"Slovak Kierkegaard\\".* Early life Parents of Krist√≠na Royov√° were descendants of two prominent Lutheran families. Father August Roy, close friend of J.M. Hurban, was member of Slavic society, co-founder of Matica Slovensk√° and Slovak gymnasiums (high schools). Mother was from house of Holuby, her brother Jozef ƒΩudov√≠t Holuby was prominent Slovak botanist, ethnographer, church historian and archaeologist and her other brother Karol Holuby was executed close to present-day ≈†ulekovo village in the revolutionary year of 1848. The childhood of Krist√≠na Royov√° was associated with Lutheran parish in Star√° Tur√°, where local chaplains were at the same time her teachers. Still, the overall education she received had not fulfilled her vast intellectual potential. The great contribution to development of her skills was a one-year study at higher secondary school in Bratislava where she managed to master the German language.

It is also known as the arrowgrass family. It includes 3 genera with a total of 34 known species (Christenhusz & Byng 2016 ). The APG II system, of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system, of 1998), also recognizes such a family and places it in the order Alismatales, in the clade monocots. The species are found in cold or temperate regions in both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere. However APG IV (2016) removed the genus Maundia due to its non-exclusive relationship, and elevated it to the monogeneric family Maundiaceae. Description Sea Arrowgrass Triglochin martima Juncaginaceae are marsh or aquatic herbs with linear, sheathing basal leaves. The flowers are small and green in erect spikes or racemes. The flower parts come in threes, but the carpels are either 3 or 6, joined to a superior ovary. The fruit is a capsule. Example arrowgrasses Triglochin include the Marsh Arrowgrass (Triglochin palustris), the Sea Arrowgrass (Triglochin maritima), and also other species like Triglochin trichophora, Triglochin striata and Triglochin mucronata.  Taxonomy  The genus Maundia was placed within the family Juncaginaceae by the APG II. The newer APG III version (2009), though, suggested it may be necessary to split Maundia off into its own monogeneric family, Maundiaceae, supported by the non-exclusive relationship of the genus to Juncaginaceae. This was achieved in the APG IV (2016), leaving only four genera in Juncaginaceae. References Bibliography   , in * * , in *  External links  * Juncaginaceae in L. Watson and M.J.

He would serve as the 1851-1853 U.S. Representative for the second district of California. Born at Piqua, Ohio, he attended Kenyon College at Gambier, Ohio, and then studied law thereafter being admitted to the bar approximately 1842 and then moved to Dayton, Ohio where he practiced law in the private sector. Here he received a public sector appointment and from 1845 to 1849, he served as the U.S. Postmaster of Dayton. As word of the discovery of gold in California spread eastward, in 1849 he left his Office in Ohio and moved to San Francisco, California. Returning to his legal experience, in 1850, he made an unsuccessful attempt to seek Office as a Judge in the 8th Judicial District. However, in that very year of 1850, the field of politics proved to be far more rewarding. In 1850, he secured Office for the term of 1850-1852 wherein he served in the State of California Assembly. In 1850, he also secured Office for the term of 1851‚Äì1853 in the 32nd U.S. Congress where he would serve as a U.S. Representative for the 2nd District of California; in 1852, he failed in his attempt to seek re-election. Perhaps better known for what he did after his term in Office had ended than during that term in Office, on June 1st of 1853, he fought a duel with the still California Democratic Party U.S. Senator William M. Gwin over the question of alleged mismanagement of federal patronage; no human died in the duel, however, a donkey met an unfortunate fate. (See Entry for William M. Gwin) After failing to get re-election, in 1852‚Äì1853, he left San Francisco, California and moved to Marysville, California where he again returned to his legal background. In 1853, he was appointed Judge to the 9th Judicial District where he served in 1853‚Äì1857. In 1855, the 'Siren Call of Politics' returned to him but he was unsuccessful in an attempt to seek an Office as a U.S. Senator. In 1857‚Äì1860, he left Marysville and returned to San Francisco where he again practiced law in the private sector. In 1860, just after the 1859 discovery of the Comstock Lode, he would leave California forever and would move to Virginia City, Nevada where he would continue the practice of law in the private sector from 1860 to 1870. Then in 1870, he moved still further eastward moving from Nevada to Washington, D.C. where he would practice law before the American-Mexican Claims Commission which was constituted back on July 4th of 1868. Then in 1884, he died while living in Branchville, Maryland. However, despite his travels across the United States, he would be interred at the place of his birth, Piqua, Ohio, at the Forest Hill Cemetery.

He was a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from 1963 to 1971 and from 1973 until his death in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1999, representing Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Riverside counties in California.  Early life  Brown was born in Holtville, California, one of four children of George Edward Brown and Bird Alma Kilgore. Brown graduated from Holtville Union High School in 1935 and attended Central Junior College (now Imperial Valley College) in 1938. He then entered the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he became head of the UCLA Student Housing Association and helped found the University Cooperative Housing Association (UHCA), a student housing cooperative, in 1938. The UCHA was formed in part to allow African American students to live off campus in the Westwood section of Los Angeles, which then did not allow them in the neighborhood. To emphasize the point, Brown took an African American roommate in the first interracial housing arrangement at UCLA. The experience was also the first example of Brown's lifelong association with cooperatives. Shortly after the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor, Japanese Americans were sent to internment camps, an action that offended Brown so much that he helped organize protests in Los Angeles in 1942. Brown's college education was interrupted by the draft, but as a Quaker, he had registered as a conscientious objector, and in 1942, he entered the Civilian Public Service at Camp 21 in Wyeth, Oregon. During his service at Camp 21, Brown realized that he could not change the broader society while he was isolated in Civilian Public Service and rescinded his conscientious objector status in 1944, entering the United States Army, serving in World War II as an instructor and rising to the rank of lieutenant by the time of his discharge in 1946. Once the war ended, he returned to college, finishing his education at UCLA, where he graduated with a BS degree in Industrial Physics in 1946.  Career  For 12 years, he was employed by the city of Los Angeles in the Department of Water and Power in engineering and personnel. In 1958, he became a management consultant. Brown continued his political activism by invigorating the Monterey Park Democratic Club. In 1954, Brown was elected as a member of city council of Monterey Park, and served until 1958. In 1956, Brown became the mayor of Monterey Park, California, until 1958. Brown's activism on behalf of civil rights continued during his term as mayor, as was evidenced by a report that when the first African American family moved to Monterey Park and met with racist protests, Brown drove to the family's home, where he spent the night to protect them.\\"The Politics of Exclusion: the Failure of Race-Neutral Policies in Urban America\\" He was a member of the California State Assembly from 1959 to 1962. His service in the state legislature was marked by a number of innovative legislative proposals. The George Brown Act of 1961 was one of the first comprehensive public employee labor relations laws in the nation.\\"Collective Bargaining in the Public Sector: the Experience of Eight States\\" Other legislative proposals included some of the first bills to ban lead in gasoline, ban the use of the pesticide DDT, and even a whimsical proposal to ban the internal combustion engine. In 1962, Brown won the election and became a member of the United States House of Representatives, where he served from 1963 to 1970. Early Congressional service Brown's Congressional service coincided with the early phases of the Vietnam War. Brown was a strong opponent of the expansion of the conflict and joined a Quaker protest on the steps of the Capitol in 1965, daring police to arrest him with the other anti-war protestors. He was a lone and steady voice and vote against the war. The Fiscal Year 1966 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill passed the House of Representatives 392‚Äì1, with Brown the sole dissenting vote. On February 26, 1966, the Foreign Aid Bill, with its provisions of support for the South Vietnamese government, passed the House 350‚Äì27, with Brown the only liberal voting \\"No\\" (the other 26 votes were conservatives opposed to foreign aid). In March 1966, the fiscal year 1966 Supplemental Appropriations Bill with funding for Vietnam passed the House 393‚Äì4, with Brown joined by Representatives Burton, Conyers, and Ryan. In August 1967, Brown was once again the sole dissenting voice against the fiscal year 1968 Defense Appropriations bill, which passed the House 407‚Äì1.The US Government and the Vietnam War: Executive and Legislative Roles and Relationships, Part IV Brown was involved in other major national policy changes were made , notably the passage of the Civil Rights Act. Brown was a strong and early advocate of the legislation and was present at the signing of the bill (second row, far left in photo).https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:LBJ_Civil_Rights_Act_crowd.jpg Brown also actively supported the farmworker organizing of Cesar Chavez and the mid-1960s grape boycott. 1970 California Senate Democratic Primary In 1970, Republican Senator George Murphy was considered vulnerable and was a top target of the Democratic Party. Representative John V. Tunney entered the race early and painted himself as a young, charismatic and energetic \\"Kennedy- esque\\" candidate, as opposed to the older, established Murphy. However, Brown also entered the race in 1969 though with little money, organization, or, most felt, chance to win. What ensued was one of the most bitter primary elections in California history. Brown touted his long standing opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam, and while Tunney also stated he opposed the war, he favored keeping the draft while Brown opposed it. Brown's mentor was Eugene McCarthy and like McCarthy in 1968, he ran a grass roots campaign. While Tunney stayed in the center-right of the political spectrum, Brown ran unabashedly to the left. Suddenly young voters flocked to the older Brown, and what seemed like an easy nomination for Tunney turned into a dogfight. The invasion of Cambodia and the Kent State killings also helped Brown. Brown made Vietnam and Richard Nixon the focus of his campaign while Tunney toed a middle ground. As Brown edged ahead in the polls, the campaign turned nasty. Tunney falsely claimed that Brown advocated campus violence and was a liberal rogue who could not be trusted in the Senate. The normally-laidback Brown then lashed out at Tunney, calling him a spoiled little rich kid. Tunney then touted his anti-war record, which Brown said was merely political grandstanding. Tunney used a late spending spree on television ads and after a hard-fought nasty campaign, Brown narrowly lost the primary. After the bitter primary, Tunney trailed Murphy in the polls by double digits but quickly made up ground and defeated Murphy handily in the general election. Return to Congress Following his defeat by Tunney in the California Senate race, Brown was awarded a Ford Foundation Fellowship and studied for a time with Ivan Illich at his Intercultural Documentation Center at Cuernavaca in Mexico. The 1970 reapportionment added five new districts to California, and in 1972, Brown sought election to the redistricted 38th congressional district and won. He was elected to the Ninety-third and to the 13 succeeding Congresses (January 3, 1973 ‚Äì July 15, 1999). Being a progressive Democrat from a largely-Republican area, Brown was famous for running in more close elections than any other representatives in the 20th century without being defeated. (A close election is considered by most pundits to be 55% of the vote or less, as most incumbent members of Congress easily top 60% in their races.) Brown topped the 55% mark only eight times in his 18 congressional elections and 60% only three times. He was nearly defeated in numerous elections starting with his first in 1962 for congressional district 29 with 55.7% of the vote. He would then earn 58.6%, 51.1%, and 52.3% in 1964, 1966, and 1968 respectively before he ran for the US Senate. In 1972, he returned to Congress by winning 56% of the vote in the Thirty-eighth district. He would then have his three easiest campaigns by winning 62.6% in 1974, 61.6% in 1976, and 62.9% in 1978. In 1980, the Ronald Reagan landslide almost forced him from office, and he struggled to hold on with 52.5% against Republican John Paul Stark. It was the first of four consecutive elections against Stark, another modern-era record. Brown would triumph with 54% in 1982 and would garner 56.6% in 1984, 57% in 1986, and 54% in 1988. In 1990 he slipped to a meager 52.7% against San Bernardino County Supervisor Rob Hammock, a sign of tough elections to come. In 1992, the famed pilot Dick Rutan held him to 50.7%. The 1996 race was even closer, as he barely defeated San Bernardino County Superior Court Judge Linda Wilde with 50.5%, winning by a plurality of only 996 votes. In his final re- election campaign in 1998, he came up with 55% of the vote. In the 102nd and the 103rd Congresses, he served as chairman of the Committee on Science, Space and Technology, which is now the House Committee on Science. Brown died on July 15, 1999, at the age of 79 in Bethesda, Maryland, from an infection developed following heart valve replacement surgery in May of that year while he was serving his 18th term in the House. At the time of his death, Brown was the ranking Democratic member on the House Science Committee and a senior member of the House Agriculture Committee. He was the oldest serving House member and the longest-serving member of the House or Senate in the history of his home state of California. The Democrat Joe Baca was elected to his seat in a special election. Legislative record A portrait of George Brown Jr. standing on the surface of the Moon. Brown was known as a champion for science. He left behind a deep and expansive legacy that has shaped science and science policy in America. Among some of his many accomplishments during his service on the House Science Committee: * Established the first federal climate change research program in the National Climate Program Act of 1978 * Established the Office of Science and Technology Policy * Established the Environmental Protection Agency * Established the (now defunct) Office of Technology Assessment Consistent with his long-held conviction that the nation needed a coherent technology policy, Brown developed an extensive technology initiative during his term as Chairman of the House Science and Technology Committee (1991-1995). This work articulated his concept of a partnership between the public and private sectors to improve the nation's competitiveness. Such successes and his continuing concern to demonstrate the practical application of advances in science and technology, he instituted the first video conferences in the U.S. Congress between the US and the Soviet Union/Russia, between 1987 and 1990. During these live teleconferences, Members of the House Science and Technology Committee exchanged ideas on science and technology via satellite with counterparts from the Commonwealth of Independent States. This series of broadcasts, hosted by Peter Jennings,Peter Jennings won an Emmy for technical achievement.http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/3.12/meier_pr.html Brown was critical of government secrecy over-reach and sought and gained a seat on the House Intelligence Committee. He pressed for a relaxation of secrecy restrictions on remote sensing satellites, seeing a great potential commercial market in remote sensing. His work eventually brought him into conflict with the intelligence community and he eventually resigned from the committee in protest.https://articles.latimes.com/1987-11-20/news/mn-15367_1_house- intelligence-panel He also was a staunch defender of civil liberties and human rights. In 1992, for example, he led a 60 Minutes investigative team to Central America to expose the use of U.S. taxpayer dollars for the construction of export processing zones in which workers were being grossly mistreated and denied their fundamental human rights as they made apparel and other consumer products exported back to the U.S. His investigation and expose surfaced in the 1992 presidential election campaign and also resulted in the Congress immediately cutting off the use of any taxpayer funds for the development of such export zones (EPZs) anywhere outside of the U.S.  Personal life  Brown's wife was Marta Macias. They had two children. In 1950s, Brown lived in Monterey Park, California. On July 15, 1999, Brown died of an infection following a heart valve replacement surgery, at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland. Legacy Because of his strong commitment to science, Congressman Brown has been honored by several science and policy related organizations and had laboratories, awards, libraries and bills named in his honor, including: * George E. Brown Salinity Laboratory * George E. Brown Jr. Library, National Academies of Science * George E. Brown Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) * H.R. 1022: George E.

Morrall, who also occasionally punted, played 21 seasons in the National Football League as both a starter and reserve. In the latter capacity, he became known as one of the greatest backup quarterbacks in NFL history.Schudel, Matt (April 26, 2014) \\"One of NFL's greatest backup QBs\\" The Washington Post, page B4. Retrieved May 2, 2014 During the 1968 Baltimore Colts season, he filled in for 9 games for an injured Johnny Unitas leading to an NFL championship shutout victory and Super Bowl III, which they lost to the New York Jets. For the 1972 Miami Dolphins season (both under coach Don Shula) he filled in for 11 games for an injured Bob Griese leading to Super Bowl VII and the only perfect season in NFL history. Morrall made Pro Bowl appearances following the 1957 and 1968 seasons. In 2015, Morrall, Griese and Dan Marino were voted to the 50 greatest players in the Miami Dolphins‚Äô 50 year history. Pre-professional career Morrall led Muskegon High School in Muskegon, Michigan to a state football championship in 1951. He attended Michigan State University, where he played under head coaches Biggie Munn and Duffy Daugherty. He played three seasons for the Michigan State Spartans football team, leading them to a 9‚Äì1 record in the 1955 season. He capped his senior year with a victory over the UCLA Bruins in the 1956 Rose Bowl. Morrall also played baseball at Michigan State and played in the College World Series as a shortstop and third baseman. He was offered the opportunity to play professional baseball but chose instead to play football. National Football League career In his more than two decades on the professional gridiron, Morrall played for six different teams, starting with his rookie year in 1956 as a first-round selection by the San Francisco 49ers. On September 16, 1957, he was traded along with guard Mike Sandusky to the Pittsburgh Steelers in exchange for linebacker Marv Matuszak and two first-round draft picks. Despite the high cost of the transaction, the Steelers traded him just over a year later to the Detroit Lions in order to obtain future Hall of Famer Bobby Layne. Morrall was with the Lions for the next six years, having his best season in 1963 by throwing for 24 touchdowns and more than 2,600 yards. The following year, he suffered a season-ending shoulder injury in an October 18 contest against the Chicago Bears. After spending the off-season rehabilitating from his injury, Morrall was dealt by the Lions to the New York Giants for Mike Lucci who had been acquired from the Cleveland Browns, Darrell Dess and a draft pick as part of a three-team transaction on August 30, 1965. The Browns obtained defensive back Erich Barnes from the Giants to complete the trade.\\"Giants Trade For Morrall,\\" United Press International, Tuesday, August 31, 1965. Retrieved December 22, 2018 Enduring his role during the Giants' rebuilding phase, Morrall threw for 2,446 yards and 22 touchdowns that season, but found himself seeing spot duty over the course of the next two years.

Morrall proceeded to lead the Colts to a 13-1 record, then added two playoff victories en route to winning the NFL's Most Valuable Player award, leading the Colts into Super Bowl III. However, in one of sport's greatest upsets, the Colts lost 16-7 to the New York Jets, with a second-quarter interception of a pass by Morrall symbolizing the team's luck on the day. Wide receiver Jimmy Orr was wide open near the end zone, but Morrall inexplicably did not see Orr (despite having successfully run the same play earlier in the year). His throw down the middle was short and intercepted by Jim Hudson to blunt the Colts' momentum. Two years later, Morrall again replaced an injured Unitas in Super Bowl V, and the Colts won 16-13 over the Dallas Cowboys on a 32-yard field goal by Jim O'Brien at the end of regulation. On April 25, 1972, Morrall was claimed on waivers for $100 by the Miami Dolphins, reuniting him with his former Colts head coach, Don Shula. Shula described Morrall as \\"an intelligent quarterback who's won a lot of ball games for me.\\" Morrall in 1976 Morrall replaced the injured Bob Griese for the Dolphins during the team's October 15 win over the San Diego Chargers. The victory gave Miami a 5-0 record, with Morrall building on that win to lead the team to the first undefeated regular season in the NFL since 1942 and only undefeated season ever, starting 11 out of 17 games that year. After notching a win in the team's first playoff game against the Cleveland Browns, Morrall struggled against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship game, leading to the return of Griese. Morrall would remain as a Dolphin quarterback for the next four seasons before finally announcing his retirement on May 2, 1977. Until first Doug Flutie and then Vinny Testaverde almost 30 years later, Morrall was the oldest quarterback to start and win a football game in the NFL. In those 21 seasons, he was part of 255 games, completing 1,379 passes for 20,809 yards and 161 touchdowns. In 2018, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Morrall to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2018. Post-professional career Morrall became the quarterback coach at the University of Miami in 1979. During his time there, he worked with Jim Kelly, Bernie Kosar, Vinny Testaverde and Mark Richt. In 1989, he was elected to the Davie, Florida city council and eventually became mayor. Morrall ran for the Florida House of Representatives District 97 seat as a Republican in 1992 and lost. During a 1989 interview, Morrall was asked what it took to come off the bench and be an effective quarterback and team leader. His response was, \\"When you get the chance to do the job, you have to do the job. That's all there is to it.\\" He died on April 25, 2014 at his son's home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He was 79.

Kebatinan is the inner-directed cultivation of inner peace, rooted in pre-Islamic traditions, whereas kejaw√®n is outer- directed and community-oriented, manifesting in rituals and practices. History A Wayang puppet representing Garuda Java has been a melting pot of religions and cultures, which has created a broad range of religious belief, including animism, spirit cults, and cosmology. Hinduism and Buddhism Indian influences came firstly in the form of Hinduism, which reached the Indonesian Archipelago as early as the first century. By the fourth century, the kingdom of Kutai in East Kalimantan, Tarumanagara in West Java, and Holing (Kalingga) in Central Java, were among the early Hindu states established in the region. Several notable ancient Indonesian Hindu kingdoms are Mataram, famous for the construction of the majestic Prambanan temple, followed by Kediri and Singhasari. Since then Hinduism, along with Buddhism, spread across the archipelago and reached the peak of its influence in the fourteenth century. The last and largest of the Hindu-Buddhist Javanese empires, that of the Majapahit, influenced the entire Indonesian archipelago. Hinduism and Buddhism penetrated deeply into all aspects of society, blending with the indigenous tradition and culture. One conduit for this were the ascetics, called \\"resi,\\" (Sanskrit rishi) who taught a variety of mystical practices. A resi lived surrounded by students, who took care of their master's daily needs. Resi's authorities were merely ceremonial. At the courts, Brahmin clerics and pudjangga (sacred literati) legitimized rulers and linked Hindu cosmology to their political needs. Presently, small Hindu enclaves are scattered throughout Java, but there is a large Hindu population along the eastern coast nearest Bali, especially around the town of Banyuwangi. Islam Java adopted Islam around 1500 CE. Islam was first accepted by the elites and upper echelons of society, which contributed to the further spread and acceptance. Sufism and other versions of Folk Islam were most easily integrated into the existing folk religion of Java. The learned versions of Sufi Islam and Shari\`a-oriented Islam were integrated at the courts, blending with the rituals and myths of the existing Hindu-Buddhist culture. Clifford Geertz described this as abangan and priyayi; \\"the lower class and elite varieties of Javanese syncretism\\". The Kyai, the Muslim scholar of the writ became the new religious elite as Hindu influences receded. Islam recognises no hierarchy of religious leaders nor a formal priesthood, but the Dutch colonial government established an elaborate rank order for mosque and other Islamic preaching schools. In Javanese pesantren (Islamic schools), The Kyai perpetuated the tradition of the resi. Students around him provided his needs, even peasants around the school. Christianity Christianity was brought to Java by Portuguese traders and missionaries, from the Dutch Reformed Church, and in the 20th century also by Roman Catholics, such as the Jesuits and the Divine Word Missionaries. Nowadays there are Christian communities, mostly Reformed in the larger cities, though some rural areas of south-central Java are strongly Roman Catholic.  Theosophy Kejaw√®n is also influenced by Theosophy. Theosophy was a very popular religion among Dutch residents in the Dutch East Indies in the early 20th century. Also many influential Indonesians joined the Theosophical Society. The Theosophical Society \\"played a role in the growth\\" of Kejaw√®n in the early and mid twentieth century, and several kebatinan groups were founded by Theosophists. The kebatinan Budi Setia group, founded in 1949, considered \\"its formal transformation into a theosophical lodge\\". Sedgwick, M. J. (2017). Western Sufism: From the Abbasids to the new age. Islam and kebatinan Although Java is predominately Muslim, kejawen the syncretic Javanese culture, still plays a cultural undercurrent among some Javanese. Some Javanese texts relate stories about Syekh Siti Jenar (also known as Syekh Lemah Abang) who had conflicts with Wali Sanga, the nine Islamic scholars in Java, and the Sultanate of Demak. With the Islamisation of Java there emerged a loosely structured society of religious leadership, revolving around kyais, Islamic experts possessing various degrees of proficiency in pre-Islamic and Islamic lore, belief and practice. The Kyais are the principal intermediaries between the villages masses and the realm of the supernatural. However, this very looseness of Kyai leadership structure has promoted schism. There were often sharp divisions between orthodox kyais, who merely instructed in Islamic law, with those who taught mysticism and those who sought reformed Islam with modern scientific concepts. As a result, the Javanese recognize two broad streams of religious commitment: # Santri or putihan (\\"pure ones\\"), what majority of Javanese people tend to follow are those who pray, performing the five obligatory daily ritual prayers. They are more orthodox in their Islamic belief and practice, and oppose the abangan, who they consider to be heterodox. # Abangan, \\"the red ones\\", who do not strictly observe the Islamic rituals. They have mixed pre-Islamic animistic and Hindu-Buddhist concepts with a superficial acceptance of Islamic belief, and emphasize the importance of the purity of the inner person, the batin. This distinction between \\"the High Islam or scripturalist, shari\`a-oriented Islam of the \`ulama\\" and \\"living local Islam\\" or \\"Folk Islam\\" or \\"popular Islam\\" is not restricted to Java, but can be found in other Islamic countries as well. Ernest Gellner has developed an influential model of Muslim society, in which this dichotomy is central: Bruinessen finds this too limited, and distinguishes three overlapping spheres: # Shari\`a-oriented Islam, # Sufism (mystical Islam, which has its learned and popular variants), # The periphery of local rituals, local shrines, local spirit cults and heterodox beliefs and practices in general. Javanese syncretistic religiousness has a strong popular base, outnumbering the santri and the support for Islamic political parties. Choy relates this to a Javanese apparent openness to new religions, but filtering out only those elements which fit into the Javanese culture. Choy mentions several reasons for this nominal Islamic identity: # The Islamic scholars in Java have been trained in curricula which were geared for social conditions of two or three centuries ago, lacking the ability to impart the spirit and sense of Islam; # The inability to summarise the principles of Islam in understandable basic points which can be applied to daily life; # Kebatinan can be learned and understood without the need to learn Arabic. In the early 20th century, several groups became formalised, developing systemetised teachings and rituals, thus offering a 'high' form of abangan religiosity, as an alternative to the 'high' Islam. Bruinessen opines that the kebatinan-movements is a deliberate rejection of scriptural Islam, which arose out of \\"folk Islam\\". Characteristics A Javanese man meditating under a Banyan tree. Dutch East Indies, before 1940. Aim Kebatinan is derived from the Arabic word batin, meaning \\"inner\\" or \\"hidden\\", or \\"inner self\\". It is a metaphysical search for harmony within one's inner self, connection with the universe, and with an Almighty God. Kebatinan believe in a \\"super- consciousness\\" which can be contacted through meditation. Beliefs Kebatinan is a combination of metaphysics, mysticism and other esoteric doctrines from Animistic, Hinduistic, Buddhist and Islamic origins. Although the Javanese culture is tolerant, and open to new religions, only those qualities are accepted and filtered which fit into the Javanese culture, character and personality. Javanese ideals combine human wisdom (wicaksana), psyche (waskita) and perfection (sempurna). The follower must control his/her passions, eschewing earthly riches and comforts, so that he/she may one day reach enlightened harmony and union with the spirit of the universe. According to Choy, the Kebatinan have no certain prophet, sacred book, nor distinct religious festivals and rituals. Nevertheless, various kebatinan-movements have their own foundational writings and founders. A kebatinan practitioner can identify with one of the six officially recognized religions, while still subscribe to the kebatinan belief and way of life. Membership Although kebatinan is a predominantly Javanese tradition, it has also attracted practitioners from other ethnic and religious groups, such as Chinese and Buddhists, and foreigners from Australia and Europe. President Suharto counted himself as one of its adherents. Their total membership is difficult to estimate as many of their adherents identify themselves with one of the official religions. Official recognition The Indonesian state ideology strives toward a unified nation, recognizing only monotheism. Meanwhile, there is also a tolerance for non-recognized religions. A broad plurality of religions and sects exist. In the middle of 1956, the Department of Religious Affairs in Yogyakarta reported 63 religious sects in Java other than the official Indonesian religions. Of these, 22 were in West Java, 35 were in Central Java, and 6 in East Java. These include also kebatinan-groups, such as Sumarah. This loosely organized current of thought and practice was legitimized in the 1945 constitution, but failed to attain official recognition as a religion. In 1973 it was recognized as Kepercayaan kepada Tuhan Yang Maha Esa (Indonesian: Belief in One Mighty God), but withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Religion and placed under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education and Culture. Practices A variety of practices is being used in kebatinan to acquire ilmu, namely tiraka and tapa or tapabrata. Many Kebatinan followers practice in their own way to seek spiritual and emotional relief. These practices are not performed in churches or mosques, but at home or in caves or on mountain perches. Meditation in Javanese culture is a search for inner self wisdom and to gain physical strength. This tradition is passed down from generation to generation. Meditation There are several tapa: * tapa Ngalong (meditation by hanging from a tree) * tapa Kungkum (meditation under a small waterfall or meeting point of 2-3 rivers / Tempuran / Tjampuhan) Fasting Fasting is a common practice employed by Javanese spiritualists in order to attain discipline of mind and body to get rid of material and emotional desires: * pasa Mutih (abstention from eating anything that is salted and sweetened, only eating/drinking pure water & rice) * pasa Senen-Kemis (fasting on Monday- Thursday) * pasa Ngebleng (fasting for a longer period, usually 3-5-7 days) Animistic worship Kebatinan often implies animistic worship, because it encourages sacrifices and devotions to local and ancestral spirits. These spirits are believed to inhabit natural objects, human beings, artifacts, and grave sites of important wali (Muslim saints). Illness and other misfortunes are traced to such spirits, and if sacrifices or pilgrimages fail to placate angry deities, the advice of a dukun or healer is sought. Other practices Other practices include: * tapa Pati-Geni (avoiding fire or light for a day or days and isolating oneself in dark rooms), * tapa Ngadam (stand/walk on foot from sunset till sunset, 24 hours in Silence) Historical texts Kebatinan and kejawen practices are extensively written about in texts that are held in the Sonobudoyo library in Yogyakarta, and the main Kraton Libraries of Surakarta and Yogyakarta. Many of the texts are deliberately elliptical so that those who do not work with either initiates or teachers are unable to ascertain or understand the esoteric doctrines and practices. In quite a few cases codified texts with secret systems to \\"unlock\\" the meanings are employed. But according to Bruinessen, the writing down of kebatinan teachings was a novelty which appeared with the institutionalisation of the kebatinan-movements in the beginning of the 20th century. Kebatinan organisations The appearance of formal kebatinan movements reflects the modernisation of Indonesia. Kebatinan movements appeared early in the 1900s in urban traditional elite circles, together with the rise of nationalism and the Muhammadiyah, a modernist Islamic movement. Hardopusoro, one of the earliest kebatinan-movements, had strong links with the Theosophical Society. Some remained very elitist, while others also accepted lower urban and rural followings, thereby popularising abangan, or syncretistic Islam, as an alternative to shari\`a-oriented Islam. After Indonesia gained independence in 1949, the kebatinan received political support and attracted large followings. Kebatinan-movements were seen by secular nationalistic elites as allies against the rise of political Islam. The political struggle between the Muslim parties and the Communists and Nationalists lead to a sharper demarcation between syncretistic and shari\`a-oriented Islam, whereby most kebatinan movements affiliated with the Communist or Nationalist Parties. Umbrella organisations representing several hundred kebatinan organisations, lobbied to attain legitimacy and recognition as an official religion. They are registered at the HKP (Himpunan Penghayat Kepercayaan), which is controlled by the PAKEM (Pengawas Aliran Kepercayaan Masyarakat). After the Suharto-era (1967-1998), the kebatinan-movements lost political support, and have become less dynamic, their adherents avoiding public engagement. Altogether several hundred kebatinan-groups are or have been registered, the best-known of which are: * Subud * Sumarah * Pangestu * Sapta Dharma * Majapahit Pancasila Subud Subud was founded in the 1920s by Muhammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjojo. The name Subud was first used in the late 1940s when Subud was legally registered in Indonesia. The basis of Subud is a spiritual exercise commonly referred to as the latihan kejiwaan, which was said by Muhammad Subuh to be guidance from \\"the Power of God\\" or \\"the Great Life Force\\". The aim of Subud is to attain perfection of character according to the will of God. Only when passion, heart and mind are separated from the inner feeling is it possible to make contact with the \\"Great Life Force\\" which permeates everywhere. The name Subud is formed from the words susila (\\"the good character of man\\"), budhi (\\"the force of the inner self\\") and dharma (\\"trust in God\\"). These words are derived from the Sanskrit words susila, bodhi and dharma.SubudBritain, About Subud Muhammad Subuh saw the present age as one that demands personal evidence and proof of religious or spiritual realities, as people no longer just believe in words. He claimed that Subud is not a new teaching or religion but only that the latihan kejiwaan itself is the kind of proof that humanity is looking for. He also rejected the classification of Subud as a kebatinan organization. There are now Subud groups in about 83 countries, with a worldwide membership of about 10,000. Sumarah Sumarah was formed in the 1930s by Pak Hardo, Pak Soekino and Pak Sutadi, without a formal organisation. In those early days, the younger members were taught kanoman, occult practices including invulnerability for knives and guns. This was regarded as essential in the struggle against the Dutch colonial powers. Around 1950, when Indonesia became an independent nation, Sumarah was streamlined and organised by Dr. Surono. The emphasis shifted from magic to \\"surrender to God\\". From 1957 on internal struggles surfaced between dr. Surono and the founders Pak Hardo and Pak Sadina, leading to a change in leadership by dr. Ary Muthy in 1967. Sumarah theology maintains that humankind's soul is like the holy spirit, a spark from the Divine Essence, which means that we are in essence similar to God. In other words, \\"One can find God within oneself,\\" a belief similar to the \\"I=God\\" theory found in Hindu-Javanese literature. According to Sumarah theology, man and his physical and spiritual world are divided into three parts: * The physical body and brain. One section, Sukusma, governs the passions. In the brain, the faculty of thinking has two functions: ** To record memories ** To serve as a means of communion with God * The invisible world, which is situated within the chest. It is the Jiwa, the ineffable soul, which provides the driving forces governing thought and reason. It is here that the deeper feeling (Rasa) is located. * The more elusive and sublime world. The most elusive and sublime world is hidden somewhere near the anatomical heart. Sumarah's conception of God is different from Islam. It has a pantheistic vision of reality, considering God to be present in all living beings. Pangestu Pangestu was founded in 1949. Its doctrine was revealed in 1932 to Sunarto Mertowarjoyo, and written down in the Setat Sasangka Djati by R.T. Harjoparakowo and R. Trihardono Sumodiharjo Pangastu. It describes the way to obtain wahyu, the blessing of God. Sapta Dharma Sapta Dharma was founded in 1952 by Harjo Sapura, after he received a revelation. According to Sri Pawenang, it was God's wish to provide the Indonesian people with a new spirituality in atime of crisis. Its aim is to free man of his passions. According to Sapta Dharma teachings, suji (meditation) is necessary to pierce through different layers of obstacles to reach Semar, the guardian spirit of Java. Theory and practice resemble Hindu Kundalini yoga, aiming at awakening the Kundalini energy and guiding it through the chakras. Majapahit Pancasila Majapahit Pancasila was founded by W. Hardjanta Pardjapangarsa. It is based in Javanese Hindu-yogic practices, c.q. Kundalini yoga, rather than Balinese ritual practice as is prevalent in Parisada Hindu Dharma. According to Hardjanta, his meditation practices also lead to invulnerability for knives, daggers and other weapons. Spread of kebatinan=Malaysia Kebatinan beliefs have spread to some parts of Malaysia, wherein certain individuals have combined it with Islamic concepts (e.g. proclaiming themselves to be new-age Islamic prophets, but delivering messages that are a combination of Islamic and kebatinan beliefs). This has led to the Malaysian Islamic authorities declaring elements of kebatinan to be \\"syirik\\" (shirk) and un-Islamic. Kebatinan interpretations of Islam are widespread in Malaysia among practitioners of silat, traditional healers, and some preachers (such as Ariffin Mohammed and other self-proclaimed Islamic prophets). Netherlands In the Netherlands, the former colonial power in Indonesia, some kebatinan-groups are active. Singapore Since the majority of Singaporean Malays are of Indonesian descent, particularly from Java, many of Kebatinan are still practiced usually among older people. However, the practice is still widespread among some Javanese Silat and Kuda Kepang groups, and also traditional shamans. Suriname It was brought to Suriname by Javanese workers in the late 19th century.

However, unlike benzoates, propionates do not require an acidic environment. Calcium propionate is used in bakery products as a mold inhibitor, typically at 0.1-0.4% (though animal feed may contain up to 1%). Mold contamination is considered a serious problem amongst bakers, and conditions commonly found in baking present near-optimal conditions for mold growth. A few decades ago, Bacillus mesentericus (rope), was a serious problem,Furia, T. E. (1973). CRC Handbook of Food Additives. CRC Handbook of Food Additives. CRC Press. but today's improved sanitary practices in the bakery, combined with rapid turnover of the finished product, have virtually eliminated this form of spoilage. Calcium propionate and sodium propionate are effective against both B. mesentericus rope and mold.Furia, T. E. (1973). CRC Handbook of Food Additives. CRC Handbook of Food Additives. CRC Press. Metabolism of propionate begins with its conversion to propionyl coenzyme A (propionyl-CoA), the usual first step in the metabolism of carboxylic acids. Since propanoic acid has three carbons, propionyl-CoA can directly enter neither beta oxidation nor the citric acid cycles. In most vertebrates, propionyl-CoA is carboxylated to D-methylmalonyl-CoA, which is isomerised to L-methylmalonyl-CoA. A vitamin B12-dependent enzyme catalyzes rearrangement of L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, which is an intermediate of the citric acid cycle and can be readily incorporated there. Children were challenged with calcium propionate or placebo through daily bread in a double‚Äêblind placebo‚Äêcontrolled crossover trial. Although there was no significant difference by two measures, a statistically significant difference was found in the proportion of children whose behaviours \\"worsened\\" with challenge (52%), compared to the proportion whose behaviour \\"improved\\" with challenge (19%). When propanoic acid was infused directly into rodents' brains, it produced reversible behavior changes (e.g. hyperactivity, dystonia, social impairment, perseveration) and brain changes (e.g. innate neuroinflammation, glutathione depletion) partially mimicking human autism. Calcium propionate can be used as a fungicide on fruit. In a 1973 study reported by the EPA, the waterborne administration of 180 ppm of calcium propionate was found to be slightly toxic to bluegill sunfish.

It is the highest point in Norfolk County and the Greater Boston area. The modern name for the hill was given by early European explorers who, while sailing along the coastline, noticed the bluish hue of the exposed granite faces when viewed from a distance (due to Riebeckite). The Blue Hills' eastern slopes face the ocean and lie within Quincy. The area attracted quarrying for its \\"blue granite\\". The name of the Massachusett Indian tribe and their language (and thus the name of the Bay, Colony, Commonwealth/State, etc.) derive from the Massachusett name for the hill: massa-adchu-es-et, where massa- is \\"large\\", -adchu- is \\"hill\\", -es- is a diminutive suffix meaning \\"small\\", and -et is a locative suffix, identifying a place.William Wallace Tooker. Algonquian Names of some Mountains and Hills. 1904. Geography The north and west sides of Great Blue Hill drain into the Neponset River, and thence into Boston Harbor. The south and east sides of Great Blue Hill drain into the Blue Hill River, thence into the Farm River, Monatiquot River, Weymouth Fore River, and into Boston Harbor. Its summit is the highest point in Greater Boston and Norfolk County and also the highest within 10 miles of the Atlantic coast south of central Maine. For this reason, American meteorologist Abbott Lawrence Rotch chose Great Blue Hill as the site for an observatory, which became known as the Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory after its completion in 1885. Rotch conducted ground-breaking studies of the atmosphere at Blue Hill for many years, and meteorological data is still gathered at the site. From the Eliot Tower at the summit, the city of Boston and many of the surrounding hills of the Milton and Canton area are visible. Other information Great Blue Hill, and the Blue Hills Reservation in general, is a popular hiking destination, valued as much for its splendid trails and views as for its proximity to the metropolitan area. There is also alpine skiing available at Blue Hills Ski Area, consisting of eight trails served by a double chair and two surface lifts. There is a steep paved road to the top, with gradients up to 16%, but is generally closed to cars except for employees of the weather observatory. The road is however open to hikers and cyclists. Boston public radio and television stations WGBH-FM-TV take their call letters from Great Blue Hill, which was the original location of the station's FM and TV transmitters. WGBH- FM still transmits from the site, grandfathered at an effective radiated power of 98,000 watts. WGBH-TV moved its antenna to a taller tower in Needham in the 1960s.

The NOAA Weather Radio station serving Greater Boston and adjacent coastal waters, KHB35, transmits atop the hill as well. In 1980, the hill was the subject of a prank by WNAC-TV's news department, where it was alleged that a volcano was erupting.

He spent decades in opposition to a succession of regimes in Guinea, unsuccessfully running against President Lansana Cont√© in the 1993 and 1998 presidential elections and leading the Rally of the Guinean People (RPG), an opposition party. Standing again in the 2010 presidential election, Cond√© was elected president in a second round of voting. When he took office that December, he became the first freely elected president in the country's history. Cond√© was reelected in 2015 with about 58% of the vote. He is a candidate in the 2020 Guinean presidential election. Upon his election in 2010, Cond√© said he would strengthen Guinea as a democracy and fight corruption, but he and his son have since been implicated in a number of corruption scandals, mostly related to the mining industry, and suspected of election rigging. On 30 January 2017, Cond√© succeeded Chad's Idriss D√©by as head of the African Union. He was succeeded by Rwandan President Paul Kagame on 28 January 2018. Early life Cond√© was born on 4 March 1938 in Boke in Lower Guinea. His parents were from Baro, a small town in Kouroussa Prefecture in the Kankan Region of Upper Guinea.. Cond√© left for France at the age of 15. He was active in the National Union of Higher Education (SNESUP), the Association of Guinean students in France (AEGF), and the Federation of Black African Students in France (FEANF), of which he was the Executive Coordinator of African National Groups (NG) from 1967 to 1975, overseeing the activities of the Directorate of FEANF. Cond√© wrote a master's thesis in political science, Le P.D.G. et le peuple de Guin√©e, in 1965. Political career WEF 2012 Cond√© won 19.6 percent of the vote in Guinea's first multiparty presidential election, held on 19 December 1993. Lansana Cont√©, who had been president since a bloodless 1984 coup d'etat, won that election with 51.7 percent of the vote. Cond√©'s supporters alleged fraud in this election after the Supreme Court nullified results in the Kankan and Siguiri prefectures, where Cond√© had received more than 90 percent of the vote.Englebert, Pierre. (2006) Guinea: recent history. In Africa south of the Sahara 2006, 35th ed. London: Routledge. In the 1998 presidential election, Cond√© ran again and received 17.6 percent of the vote, placing third behind Cont√© (56.1 percent) and Mamadou Boye B√¢ (24.6 percent). On 16 December, two days after the poll, Cond√© was arrested and charged with trying to leave the country illegally; he was also charged with attempting to recruit forces to destabilize the government. Controversy during his detention focused on whether he could be represented by foreign as well as domestic lawyers, and whether defense lawyers were being given full access to him in jail. Cond√©'s trial, initially scheduled to begin in September 1999, did not begin until April 2000. Cond√©, along with 47 co-defendants, was charged with hiring mercenaries, planning to assassinate President Cont√©, and upsetting the state's security. Defense lawyers began by calling for the judge to immediately release their clients, then quit, saying that under the circumstances they could not properly make a defense. The trial was thus delayed several times, during which time Cond√© refused to speak in court, and his co-defendants denied all of the charges. The trial finally continued in August, and in mid-September Cond√© was sentenced to jail for five years. However, Cond√© was released in May 2001 when he was pardoned by President Cont√©, with the condition that he was prohibited from engaging in political activities. Following his release, he left Guinea for France, returning in July 2005. Upon his return, some reports indicated that he intended to organize the RPG for the municipal elections held in late 2005, but later stated his intention to boycott them. Following Cont√©'s death and the 23 December 2008 military coup, Cond√© met with Moussa Dadis Camara, the President of the National Council for Democracy and Development (CNDD), on 27 December 2008. After the meeting, Cond√© said that the members of the CNDD junta were \\"patriots\\". Later, however, he opposed the junta and was criticised by Camara. 2010 election Cond√© stood again in the June-November 2010 presidential election. During the first round, he received 18 percent of the votes, while Cellou Dalein Diallo placed first with over 40 percent. On 15 November 2010 Cond√© was declared the winner of the second round with 52.5 percent. Observers of the election noted that his win was surprising given his poor results in the first round. A report prepared by the Carter Center noted several irregularities in voter registration, vote counting and the loss of nearly 1 million voters from the final count. The Carter Center criticized the decision by the Supreme Court of Guinea to proceed to a second round of voting. Despite claims of election corruption, Alpha Cond√© was sworn in on 21 December 2010. In 2011, Palladino Capital 2, an investment company run by South African billionaire Walter Hennig, lent Guinea $25 million allegedly in order to fund the establishment of a state mine. But it soon became evident that the money was not used as intended and the terms were detrimental to Guinea. Furthermore, according to former Guinean Minister of Mines Mahmoud Thiam, the deal included a commitment to support Cond√©'s political campaign. In 2012, after extensive public criticism the loan was returned and the deal was cancelled. After he was elected, Cond√© seemingly attempted to improve the mining law in Guinea, in order to reduce corruption in the sector and increase the country's benefit. However, as revealed in 2016 Samuel Mebiame, who had been involved in bribing high-level government officials in return for mining rights in the country, was also involved in rewriting the mining law in a manner that benefited the companies with which he was working. According to various documents that were leaked to the international NGO Global Witness, mining company Sable Mining was involved in helping Cond√© win the 2010 election in return for mining rights in the country. Global Witness reported that Sable Supported Cond√©'s election campaign, organized logistics and strategic meetings, offered to loan him a helicopter, and paid bribe money to his son, Alpha Mohammed Cond√©, in order to secure mining permits in a number of areas, including Mount Nimba. In an email sent from Alpha Mohammed Cond√© to Sable in August 2010, he said that backing his father's campaign \\"will make my dad all the more comfortable to support our business partnerships\\". Assassination attempt On 19 July 2011, the presidential residence was shelled, resulting in the death of a presidential guard and the injuries of two others; Cond√©, however, survived the assassination attempt.\\"Guinea arrests troops after assassination bid\\", Al Jazeera, 22 July 2011. A former army chief and a member of the presidential guard were arrested hours after the two attacks on his house. The President later spoke to the country saying that \\"My house was attacked last night, but I congratulate the presidential guard who fought heroically from 3:10 until 5:00 before backup arrived.\\" He also added that his plans for reform would not fail. Three days later at least 41 soldiers were arrested for the assassination attempt. A government official said that many of those arrested had ties to the country's previous military rulers. The United Nations reacted by saying that there was a greater need for military reforms in Guinea. The UN Special Representative for West Africa, Said Djinnit, said that the assault showed \\"weaknesses remain in Guinea's defence and security systems [and] reinforces the UN's determination to support the country's military reforms. I saw the damage...[the attack] clearly intended to kill the president.\\" 2013 pre-election violence Cond√© received criticism during week-long protests and violence in late February and early March 2013, after opposition supporters took to the streets of Conakry to protest against his alleged attempts to rig the 2013 parliamentary election. The opposition coalition withdrew from the electoral process in mid-February, mainly due to Cond√©'s insistence on using a South African firm, Waymark Infotech , to draw up the registered voter list. Cond√© with U.S. President Barack Obama, 2014 Cond√© with Russian President Vladimir Putin, 2017 The ensuing violence resulted in at least nine deaths and hundreds injured, many from the alleged brutality of the security forces who reportedly used live ammunition to disperse some of the crowds. Voting finally took place on 28 September but local and international observers claimed the process was significantly flawed, they observed ballot stuffing, voter intimidation, and minors casting votes. These organizational problems and irregularities led to a three-week delay in the announcement of the election results, which in turn led to further tension. At this point regional UN and EU representatives intervened and strongly recommended that the situation be addressed peacefully via the legal system. 2015 election On 17 October 2015, Cond√© was re- elected to a second term with 57.85 percent of the vote, winning an outright majority in the first round of voting. The opposition claimed that the election was marred by fraud and mismanagement. Cellou Dalein Diallo, who received around 30% of the vote, rejected the results, claiming the vote had been rigged. He accused the government of intimidating voters, ballot stuffing, permitting minors to vote, and altering the electoral map. However, he did not file an official appeal. Cond√© was sworn in for his second term on 14 December 2015.\\"Guinea's president sworn in for 2nd term\\", Associated Press, 14 December 2015. 2016 corruption allegations In 2016, French news organization FRANCE 24 released audio recordings that appear to prove that the mining company Rio Tinto paid Guinean government official and close acquaintance of the president a sum of $10.5 million for mining rights in the Simandou mine. President Cond√© says that de Combret acted alone. Audio recordings do not implicate the president as there is no indication in it that he was not simply demanding down payment on the $700 million contract on behalf of the government with no payoff involved. Rio Tinto admitted to the payment in November 2016.  Personal life  Cond√© is a Muslim.Guinea: No more power based on ethnicity He is married to Djene Kaba Cond√©.

He is particular remembered for his broadcasts of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force \\"Kiwis\\" during the Second World War and later for All Blacks matches. Born in Wellington he was educated at St Patrick's College. As a schoolboy, McCarthy recalled meeting VC winner Billy Hardham in 1922; \\"a very silent, simple man\\" living in a flat in Kelburn who had played rugby for Wellington 51 times, and who gave him a historic book on rugby.Haka: The Maori Rugby Story by Winston McCarthy and Bob Howitt, page 67 (1983, Rugby Press, Auckland) A promising rugby union half-back, he played for the Manawatu B and Bush (Now part of Wairarapa-Bush) teams in the 1930s. In 1936 he moved to the South Island's West Coast and played rugby league for the Waiuta club before a shoulder injury ended his playing career. He began a career in radio in 1937 when he began work as programme organiser for the National Broadcasting Service at station 2YD in Wellington. During the Second World War he worked with well-known sports broadcaster Wallie Ingram as a result of a posting to the Army Education and Welfare service. In 1945‚Äì46 he was chosen to broadcast commentaries of the games played in Europe by the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force rugby team, nicknamed the Kiwis. These were the first live rugby broadcasts from the United Kingdom to New Zealand. It was during one of these matches that he coined his catch-phrase \\"Listen... Listen... It's a goal!\\". His last commentary of a rugby test match was the final test of the 1959 British Lions tour. Before the era of television, when radio and rugby were New Zealand passions, he had broadcast 38 tests, creating vivid, unforgettable word pictures. He had also commentated other sports, such as cricket and boxing, and commentated at the 1950 and 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth and 1956 Olympic games.

Their first drummer was the late Bj√∏rn Uglebjerg. He was replaced by S√∏ren Berlev in 1971. At their formation, the guitar playing of Franz Beckerlee was inspired by Jimi Hendrix and the vocals and lyrics of Larsen was inspired by Bob Dylan, while the rhythm playing of J√∏nsson and Berlev owed much to The Beatles. However, they would soon develop their own musical style. The pop sensibility of Kim Larsen, the artistic attitude of Franz Beckerlee and the musical competence of Wili J√∏nsson would prove to be a recipe for success. Gasolin's lyrics were generally written by the entire group, often with the assistance of their friend Mogens Mogensen.  History  Franz Beckerlee and Wili J√∏nsson had known each other since they were boys, and as both played music they wanted to form a band together. While Beckerlee had been brought up without much love by his grandmother and grandfather, he felt warmth in Wili's home.Danish TV- Documentary, aired several times at DR' channels Kim Larsen joined them after reading an ad which was put up at Christiania. He soon became \\"one of the boys,\\" but the band still lacked a drummer. After a while Bj√∏rn Uglebjerg became their first drummer, but was later replaced with S√∏ren Berlev.Danish TV-Documentary, aired several times at DR (broadcaster)' channels. In 1970 Gasolin' released their first single \\"Silky Sally.\\" It was followed by \\"Child of Institution\\" and \\"Johnny The Jackpot.\\" These three singles were sung in English and flopped. Their debut album and all subsequent albums had Danish lyrics and were a success. Although they would occasionally still sing in English, Danish proved to be the language where they could express themselves most eloquently and this was acknowledged by the Danish audience and critics. From 1972 to 1978, Gasolin' was the most popular rock band in Denmark. With producer Roy Thomas Baker, they released classics such as Gasolin' 3, Gas 5 and Efter endnu en dag. Some people consider Gasolin' to be the Danish Beatles, with each album a landmark and like The Beatles, the band broke up at the pinnacle of their success. The reasons for the split-up were the failure to break the international market and personal differences. After the demise, Kim Larsen would go on to become a very successful solo artist. His album from 1983, Midt om Natten, is the best-selling album in Denmark ever. Wili J√∏nsson and S√∏ren Berlev would go on playing music as session musicians and in various bands. Franz Beckerlee works as an artist, but occasionally he played with S√∏ren Berlev in Christianhavns Bluesband and in 1979 he released No Kiddin. In 1991, the CD compilation Rabalderstr√¶de Forever became a hit as was the box set from 2003 The Black Box. In 2006, a movie called Gasolin' 4-ever directed by Anders √òstergaard became the most popular documentary movie in Denmark ever.

Life Yang Jun was from Huayin in Hongnong Commandery (ÂºòËæ≤, roughly modern Sanmenxia, Henan). His niece Yang Yan was Emperor Wu's first wife and empress. As she neared death in 274, she feared that whoever would be empress next would endanger the crown prince status of her developmentally disabled son, Sima Zhong. She therefore asked Emperor Wu to marry her cousin, Yang Jun's daughter Yang Zhi. Emperor Wu agreed, and after her death later during the year, he married Yang Zhi in 276 and created her empress. Yang Jun, as the empress' father, became an increasingly important official in government, and became exceedingly arrogant. In Emperor Wu's later years, when he became obsessed with feasting and women, Yang Jun and his brothers Yang Yao (Ê•äÁèß) and Yang Ji (Ê•äÊøü) became effectively in power. As Emperor Wu grew ill in 289, he considered whom to make regent. He considered both Yang Jun and his uncle Sima Liang the Prince of Ru'nan, the most respected of the imperial princes. As a result, Yang Jun became fearful of Sima Liang and had him posted to the key city of Xuchang. Several other imperial princes were also posted to other key cities in the empire. By 290, Emperor Wu resolved to let Yang and Sima Liang both be regents, but after he wrote his will, the will was seized by Yang Jun, who instead had another will promulgated in which Yang alone was named regent. Emperor Wu died soon thereafter. Crown Prince Zhong succeeded to the throne as Emperor Hui. Yang Jun became Emperor Hui's regent, and became much criticized for spending his energy on making himself secure‚Äîincluding not attending Emperor Wu's burial. Fearful of Emperor Hui's ambitious wife Empress Jia Nanfeng, he ordered that imperial edicts be cosigned by his daughter, Empress Dowager Yang. Yang knew that he had made a lot of enemies, and tried to pacify them by giving widespread promotions, but those promotions only served to show his weakness. His associates, including his brother Yang Ji, tried to persuade him to alleviate the tension by inviting Sima Liang back to the capital Luoyang to serve as coregent, a move that Yang Jun repeatedly rebuffed. Empress Jia, who wanted her hand in governance, was dissatisfied with the situation, and conspired with the eunuch Dong Meng (Ëë£Áåõ) and the generals Meng Guan (Â≠üËßÄ) and Li Zhao (ÊùéËÇá) against the Yangs. She tried to include Sima Liang into the conspiracy, but Sima Liang declined; instead, she persuaded Emperor Hui's brother, Sima Wei the Prince of Chu, to join her plan. In 291, after Sima Wei returned to Luoyang from his defense post (Jing Province (ËçäÂ∑û, modern Hubei and Hunan)) with his troops, a coup went into progress. Empress Jia, who had her husband easily under her control, had him issue an edict declaring that Yang Jun had committed crimes and should be removed from his posts. It also ordered Sima Wei and Sima Yao (Âè∏È¶¨Áπá) the Duke of Dong'an to attack Yang's forces and defend against counterattacks. Quickly, it became clear that Yang was in trouble, particularly after he declined his strategists' suggestion to burn the palace gate to temporarily halt the advance of the imperial guards. Empress Dowager Yang, trapped in the palace herself, wrote an edict ordering assistance for Yang Jun and put it on arrows, shooting it out of the palace. Empress Jia then made the bold declaration that Empress Dowager Yang was committing treason. Yang Jun was quickly defeated, and his clan was massacred. References * Fang, Xuanling.

It is adjacent to Taikoo Place, another office complex developed by Swire. The six-level shopping centre, connected to Tai Koo Station, houses more than 170 shops, restaurants, a cinema and an indoor ice rink. Cityplaza constantly updates its seasonal decoration, and also has frequent art, sport and other exhibitions in the public space near the MTR station. History and development=Phase I Cityplaza was completed in 1982. As there was no MTR connection yet, double decker buses were used as a free shuttle service when the Island Eastern Corridor expressway was finished in 1984. There are six storeys in Phase I, with many locations having changed. The first phase also included an office tower called Mount Parker House which has since been demolished and replaced with the East hotel. The 1/F used to be a Standard Chartered Bank with the remaining space for car parking, until 1987 when a big renovation saw the area converted into retail stores, including Marks & Spencer. After the relocation of Wing On Department Stores, the former space was left unoccupied for over three years. Only in 1999 was it leased to Citysuper Log-On, and later fashion store Uniqlo. Phase II Phase II was completed in 1987. As there was a hole in the southwest corner of 2/F (opposite Cafe de Coral), one could see part of Whimsy's mini roller coaster ride, but this was filled after the latter's closing down in 1990. There were also large neon advertisements in the middle of Phase II, but these were removed after a big renovation in 2002 and 2014. The old food court, including Burger King, Oliver's Super Sandwiches, Mario's, Fairwood, were originally situated next to the ice rink. It was closed in 2001 and replaced by the another food court on the 3rd floor, called Food Republic. In Dec 2016, a new food court, TREATS, opened in the original shop of Maxim's Palace. It provides bread, cheese sandwiches, fresh juices, Hong Kong style barbecued food & noodles, pasta, salad, sushi, sashimi and bento. Two restaurants, Cha Cha Room (dim sum) and Minh & Kok (Vietnamese food) are also situated inside TREATS.  Services  Cityplaza has offered a three-hour free Wi-Fi access. Also, the mall provides two car parks, namely Cityplaza Carpark and Taikoo Shing Stage 10 Carpark.  Entertainment  The shopping centre is host to the oldest ice skating rink in Hong Kong named \\"Ice Palace\\". The cinema, MOViE MOViE Cityplaza was opened in 2017, boasting 6 widescreen theatres, including ‚ÄúMOViEMAXX‚Äù and one luxurious VIP house ‚ÄúMM Moments‚Äù. Transport MTR Tai Koo Station is accessible directly from the second floor of Cityplaza. The companion escalator running from the MTR station to Cityplaza was completed in April 2012. Shoppers can also get to the shopping centre by buses. ;Buses and minibuses Buses and minibuses ;Citybus *77- Tin Wan ‚Üî Shau Kei Wan *77X- Wah Kwai Estate ‚Üí Tai Hong Street *85- Siu Sai Wan ‚Ü∫ Braemar Hill *85A- Shau Kei Wan ‚Ü∫ Braemar Hill (Morning Peak) *85A- Aldrich Bay ‚Üí Braemar Hill (Morning Peak) *85A- North Point (Island Place) ‚Üí Shau Kei Wan (Afternoon Peak) *99- South Horizons ‚Üî Shau Kei Wan *99X- South Horizons/ Ap Lei Chau ‚Üí Tai Hong Street *A12- Airport (Ground Transportation Centre) ‚Üî Siu Sai Wan (Island Resort) ;New World First Bus *2- Grand Promenade ‚Üî Central (Macau Ferry) *81- Hing Wah Estate ‚Üî Lai Tak Tsuen (via Tai Hang) *81A- Hing Wah Estate ‚Üî Lai Tak Tsuen (via Braemar Hill) (Rush Time Service) *82- North Point Ferry ‚Üî Siu Sai Wan (Island Resort) *82X- Siu Sai Wan ‚Ü∫ Quarry Bay *85- North Point (Island Place)‚Üî Siu Sai Wan (Island Resort) *720- Grand Promenade ‚Üî Central (Macau Ferry) (Express) *720P- Tai Koo Shing ‚Üî Central (Gilman Street) (Morning Peak Service) *722- Yiu Tung Estate ‚Ü∫ Central (Exchange Square) ;Cross Harbour Tunnel Bus *102- Mei Foo ‚Üî Shau Kei Wan *106- Siu Sai Wan ‚Üî Wong Tai Sin *110- Shau Kei Wan ‚Ü∫ Tsim Sha Tsui/ Jordan *606- Choi Wan (Fung Shing Street) ‚Üî Siu Sai Wan (Island Resort) *606A- Choi Wan (Fung Shing Street) ‚Üî Yiu Tung (Morning Peak Service) *682- Ma On Shan ‚Üî Chai Wan (East) *682A- Ma On Shan Town Centre ‚Üí Siu Sai Wan Estate (Morning Peak Service) (No Return Trip Service to Ma On Shan.) *682B- Sha Tin ‚Üí Siu Sai Wan Estate (Morning Peak Service) (No Return Trip Service to Sha Tin.) *682P- Ma On Shan/ Wu Kai Sha Station ‚Üí Chai Wan (East) (Morning Peak Service) (No Return Trip Service to Ma On Shan.) *802- Sha Tin Racecourse ‚Üí Siu Sai Wan (Island Resort) (Race Day Service) (No Return Trip Service to Sha Tin.) *N122- Mei Foo ‚Üî Shau Kei Wan (Midnight Service) ;Minibus *18- Hang Hau (North) ‚Üî North Point (Pak Fuk Road) *32- Kornhill ‚Üî Shau Kei Wan *68- Aldrich Bay ‚Üî Quarry Bay Tai Koo *65A- Quarry Bay ‚Üî Chai Wan See also * One Island East * Swire Hotels * Taikoo Place ReferencesExternal links * Category:1982 establishments in Hong Kong Category:Office buildings in Hong Kong Category:Quarry Bay Category:Shopping malls established in 1982 Category:Shopping centres in Hong Kong Category:Swire Group ","title":"Cityplaza"},{"id":"3556689","text":"Bob Stutt is a Canadian puppeteer and writer, who has starred in various children's television programs throughout his career.

However, a drunken hunting party complicates matters. It stars Christopher George, Andrew Prine and Richard Jaeckel. Widely considered a Jaws rip-off, Grizzly used many of the same plot devices as its shark predecessor, which had been a huge box- office success during the previous year. The giant grizzly bear in the film was portrayed by a Kodiak bear named Teddy, who was tall. Plot The film opens with military veteran helicopter pilot and guide Don Stober (Prine) flying individuals above the trees of a vast national park. He states that the woods are untouched and remain much as they did during the time when Native Americans lived there. Two female hikers are breaking camp when they are suddenly attacked and killed by an unseen animal. The national park's Chief Ranger, Michael Kelly (George), and photographer Allison Corwin (Joan McCall), daughter of the park's restaurant owner, decide to follow a ranger to the primitive campsite to check on the female hikers. There, they discover the mangled corpses of the two girls, one of which has been partially buried. At the hospital, a doctor tells Kelly that the girls were killed by a bear. The park supervisor, Charley Kittridge (Joe Dorsey), blames Kelly for the attacks, saying that the bears were supposed to have been moved from the park by Kelly and naturalist Arthur Scott (Jaeckel) before the tourist season began. Kelly and Kittridge argue over closing the park, before deciding to move all hikers off the park's mountain while allowing campers to remain in the lowlands. Kelly calls Scott, who had been traveling with a deer family. Informing Scott about the bear attack, Kelly also tells him to come back. During a search of the mountain, a female ranger stops for a break at a waterfall. Deciding to soak her feet and finally taking off her clothes and showering in the waterfall, she is unaware that the grizzly bear is lurking under the falls, and she is attacked and killed. Kelly recruits the helicopter pilot, Stober, to assist in the search. Flying above the forest, they see what they believe to be an animal, only to discover the naturalist Scott adorned in an animal skin while tracking the bear. Telling them all of the bears are accounted for and this specific bear is unknown to the forest, Scotty informs them that the animal they are looking for is a prehistoric grizzly bear (a fictional Pleistocene Epoch Arctodus ursus horribilis) standing at least tall and weighing between . Kelly and Stober scoff at the notion. At the busy lowland campground, the grizzly bear tears down a tent and kills a woman. Kelly once again insists on closing the park, but Kittridge refuses. The attacks are becoming a national news story, and to counteract this, Kittridge allows amateur hunters into the forest. Now a team, Kelly, Stober, and Scott are disgusted by this development. Later, a lone hunter is chased by the grizzly bear, but he manages to escape the animal by jumping into a river and floating to safety. Later that night, three hunters find a bear cub that they believe is the cub of the killer grizzly bear, so they use it as bait for the mother. However, the grizzly bear finds and eats the cub without the hunters even noticing. Scott thus concludes that the grizzly bear must be a male, as only male bears are cannibalistic. Kelly assigns fellow ranger Tom at a fire lookout tower on the mountain. However, he is attacked by the grizzly bear. The animal tears down the tower and kills Tom. Kelly and Kittridge continue to argue over closing the park. Frustrated by the politics of the situation, Scott sneaks away to track the grizzly bear on his own. On the outskirts of the national park, a mother and her young child are attacked by the grizzly bear. The mother is killed while the child survives, albeit severely mutilated. Stunned by this development, Kittridge finally allows Kelly to close down the park and ban all hunters. Stober and Kelly now go after the elusive grizzly bear alone, setting up a trap by hanging a deer carcass from a tree. The grizzly bear goes for the bait, but suddenly retreats. The men chase the animal through the woods, but it easily outruns them. When they return, they discover the grizzly bear tricked them and took the deer carcass anyway. The next day, Scott, tracking on horseback, finds the remains of the deer carcass and calls Stober and Kelly on the radio. He plans to drag the deer carcass behind his horse and create a trap by leading the grizzly bear towards them. However, the grizzly bear ambushes Scott, killing his horse and knocking him unconscious. He subsequently awakens to find himself alive, but half- buried in the ground. Just as he finishes digging himself out, the grizzly bear returns and kills him. Kelly and Stober discover Scott's mutilated body and, in despair, return to the helicopter to track the grizzly bear from the air. They soon spot the grizzly bear in a clearing and quickly land. The grizzly bear attacks the helicopter, swiping at the craft and causing Stober to be thrown clear. The grizzly bear kills Stober before turning on Kelly, who frantically pulls a bazooka from the helicopter. Before the grizzly bear can reach him, Kelly fires the bazooka at the grizzly bear, exploding him to death. For several seconds, Kelly sadly stares at the burning remains of the grizzly bear, before walking towards Stober's body. Cast * Christopher George as Michael Kelly * Andrew Prine as Don Stober * Richard Jaeckel as Arthur Scott * Joan McCall as Allison Corwin * Joe Dorsey as Charley Kittridge * Charles Kissinger as Dr. Hallitt * Mike Clifford as Pat *Teddy as the grizzly bear Production The idea for Grizzly began when the film's producer and writer, Harvey Flaxman, encountered a bear during a family camping trip. Co-producer and co-writer David Sheldon thought the idea would make a good film following the success of Jaws. Girdler discovered the script on Sheldon's desk and offered to find financing as long as he could direct the film. Within a week, Girdler was able to obtain $750,000 in financing from Edward L. Montoro's Film Ventures International movie distribution company. Grizzly was filmed on location in Clayton, Georgia, with many local residents cast in supporting roles. Catherine Rickman, who played one of the first victims, was actually the daughter of Clayton's mountain man, Frank Rickman. Though unintentional, the casting of George, Prine, and Jaeckel marked the second time this trio of actors starred together in the same film. They had previously played supporting roles in the Western Chisum (1970) starring John Wayne. A Kodiak bear nicknamed Teddy performed as the killer grizzly bear. Teddy was 11 feet tall and was the largest bear in captivity at that time. The bear was rented from the Olympic Game Ranch in Sequim, Washington, where he was kept behind an electric fence. The crew was protected from the bear by a piece of green string running through the shooting locations and a ticking kitchen timer. This resembled (to the bear) an electric fence. Actors and crew members were instructed to always stay on the camera side of the string. The bear did not actually roar, so it was tricked into making the motions of roaring by throwing several marshmallows into its mouth and then holding a final marshmallow in front of its face, but not throwing it. The bear would stretch for it. The sound was artificially produced. The original artwork for the Grizzly film poster was created by popular comic book artist Neal Adams. A movie tie-in novelization by Will Collins (a pseudonym of Edwin Corley) was published in 1976 by Pyramid Books and accompanied the film's release.http://www.fright.com/edge/GrizzlyNovel.htm Reception Critical reception for Grizzly in 1976 was extremely negative, with most critics criticizing the film for being too similar to Steven Spielberg's thriller Jaws. Vincent Canby, from the New York Times, criticized the film's poor plotting, cinematography and editing. He wrote, \\"Grizzly, which opened yesterday at the Rivoli and other theaters, is such a blatant imitation of Jaws that one has to admire the depth of the flattery it represents, though not the lack of talent involved.\\" Donald Guarisco from AllMovie gave the film a negative review, criticizing the film's script, cheap gore, and overuse of clich√©s, and saying, \\"This energetic but clumsy horror effort is too contrived and poorly realized to be worthwhile for most viewers.\\" Film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film two out of four stars, calling it an \\"OK rip-off of Jaws\\". Despite the negative reviews, Grizzly was the top grossing independent film of 1976, earning nearly $38 million worldwide, and held the record until Halloween was released two years later in 1978. The film's executive producer, Edward L. Montoro, president of Film Ventures International distributed the film in the U.S. and Canada and sold the worldwide distribution rights to Columbia Pictures for $1.5 million. Montoro later tried to keep the profits to himself instead of paying the film's director William Girdler and producers/writers David Sheldon and Harvey Flaxman. The three sued Montoro and he was eventually ordered by the Los Angeles County Superior Court to pay Girdler, Sheldon and Flaxman their share of the profits from the distribution of the film. The original music score by Robert O. Ragland has since been largely well received. Ragland commissioned the National Philharmonic Orchestra for the film's theme. The original soundtrack was finally released on CD and MP3 format in September 2018. On the film review website Rotten Tomatoes the film holds a 44% rating based on nine reviews, with an average rating of 4.6 out of 10. Home video Grizzly was released on VHS by Anchor Bay Entertainment. It was released in the LaserDisc format in 1984 by RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video, but only in Japan. The DVD version of Grizzly was first released on December 2, 1998 by Shriek Show, and was re- released on DVD by Scorpion Releasing on August 5, 2014. Scorpion Releasing issued a limited-edition Blu-ray in September 2015 exclusively through Screen Archives Entertainment. On April 21, 2017, RiffTrax released a VOD of the film with comedy commentary by Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett. Sequel A sequel, now known as Grizzly II: Revenge (originally known as Grizzly II: The Predator and Grizzly II: The Concert), was filmed in 1983 in Hungary by director Andr√© Sz√∂ts, but was never released to theaters. Sheldon, the co-producer and writer of Grizzly, wrote the screenplay with his screenwriter wife, McCall, who also reprised her role from the original film. The stars were Louise Fletcher, Steve Inwood, John Rhys-Davies, Deborah Raffin and Deborah Foreman. The cast also included Charlie Sheen, George Clooney and Laura Dern, who were unknown at the time, despite being from families of popular stars. It also featured live performances by Toto Coelo, Landscape III, and other musicians. The main scenes for Grizzly II: The Predator were completed, but before special effects featuring a huge electro-mechanical bear could be used, the executive producer, Joseph Proctor, disappeared with all of the funds, with some sources saying that he was jailed during the time of the filming. Filmed footage of a live bear, however, attacking a live rock concert, was shot in Hungary. Attempts have been made to re-cut and film more scenes but, to date, the film has never been released. A bootleg version with the original workprint was released in 2007. In 2019, GBGB International took over the completion of the film and intended to show a completed version for the first time at the Hollywood Reel Independent Film Festival on February 17 2020.

Holy Forest Academy faculty and staff= Eikichi Onizuka  * *Japanese live-action actor: Takashi Sorimachi, Akira (2012 remake) A 22-year-old, blonde-haired biker, virgin, and former b≈çs≈çzoku, Eikichi Onizuka is the protagonist of GTO. He graduated from a bottom-rung university by cheating and, as such, cannot get a decent job. His primary way of spending time is peeping up girls' skirts at a local mall. He is very athletic and has a second dan black belt in karate. Onizuka decides to become a teacher. His initial training is in the Musashino Public High School, where he meets Nanako Mizuki. His experience taming the rowdy gangs in his assigned class hardens his convictions that teaching is the way to go, and when he learns of Mizuki's problems, he also decides to abstain from sexual experience with schoolgirls, opting to solve their personal issues for them, instead. Unfortunately, he forgets to take the public teachers' civil service exam; as a result, no public high school will accept him, but he is still eligible for private school teaching. He manages to get a job at the Holy Forest Academy, despite the objections of Vice-Principal Hiroshi Uchiyamada, whom he continues to aggravate well into his tenure. One of the conditions of having the job at Holy Forest is that he must sleep at the school ‚Äì in the storage room at the top floor, with roof access ‚Äì and it is here that Onizuka officially starts his career in teaching, when he stops Noboru Yoshikawa from committing suicide. Onizuka is put in charge of class 3‚Äì4, a class so bad it has driven past teachers insane and one to death. Not only does he survive their brutal, bullying tactics, but he also befriends his students, and the backbone to the story of GTO consists of his unique experiences in turning his students around and learning lessons of his own. Onizuka is capable of great feats of strength, such as arm-wrestling over 100 men of exponential strength, (sometimes 3 at once) in a row and winning. He is also an experienced martial artist, as Onizuka is capable of fending off multiple opponents, even if they are well-armed. However, it was revealed around chapter 190 that because of all the physical damage he sustained since he started teaching, it resulted in a clotted blood vessel in his brain, and that a jolt to his head could either turn him into a vegetable, paralyze him, or kill him. In spite of his impressive fighting skills, Onizuka is often roughed up by his students, and others, whenever he behaves badly. It could be speculated that deep down, Onizuka knows when he's acting immature, and allows others to keep him in line. An example of this is when he forces his students to dig for buried treasure during the Okinawa trip. Urumi Kanzaki kicks Onizuka into a hole, and later forces him to wear S&M; garb and has him crawl around on all fours, with Urumi riding on his back. Another example is when Vice-Principal Uchiyamada has Onizuka over for dinner and hits him on the head with a wooden bench after finding out that he was acting lecherous with his daughter at a karaoke bar (Onizuka was playing \\"Where's The Nipple?\\"). His mode of transportation is a Kawasaki Z750RS Z2 motorcycle, and is also the protagonist in the GTO prequel, Shonan Junai Gumi. It is shown throughout the series that Onizuka is also very lucky, as he always manages to squeeze out of tight situations. An example of this is when he must raise 8 million yen to live up to a promise he made to the 3rd year students. He received what he believed to be a winning lottery ticket, but it turned out to be false. However, he was given a raffle ticket which he kept but didn't expect for it to help his predicament, but ended up winning a Mercedes-Benz E-Class car worth the 8 million yen. He gave away the Mercedes in an act of kindness, and while it seemed unlikely for him to get the car back, it was returned to him in the last minute. GTO-Shonan 14 days In Shonan 14 Days, Onizuka revealed on a live television program that he nearly buried one of his students for thinking that she is dead. Although he denied the claim that he did this on purpose, the crowd did not take it and Onizuka was forced to leave Tokyo for a while until the outrage subsides. He goes to Shonan, a place where he grew up. There he met Shiratori, one of Fuyutsuki's friends and he learns that she is a caregiver at the White Swan Youth Home which houses kids from broken homes. He tells her that he is a teacher back in Tokyo and he probably could give her a hand in managing the kids at White Swan. Shiratori invites him to stay with them and help out, and Onizuka obliges in order to help the kids in the same manner he does at school. Onizuka mentioned a little about his dad, who left his mom when he was younger for another woman when he shows Katsuragi his secret place, a place where he goes when he is stressed out or in trouble. Katsuragi thinks that she might have misjudged him and started to think of Onizuka on a different perspective after that. GTO:Paradise Lost The next stage for Eikichi Onizuka: Kissho Academy‚Äôs Class G, a newly established class for young celebrities. But as Onizuka soon finds out, his new teaching assignment is no superstar paradise‚Äîit's a super problem class, feared by all!  Azusa Fuyutsuki  ; * *Japanese live-action actor: Nanako Matsushima, Miori Takimoto (2012 remake) : A 22 year-old female teacher, employed at the same private school as Eikichi Onizuka, Azusa Fuyutsuki is the heroine of the series.

Her quiet manner and moderate ideas are misleading, as she proves to be very tough on her own, which scares the overconfident, zealous Onizuka. To prepare him for the test which would determine his teaching career, she makes a mountain of jelly with eyes of Maguro tuna fish as fruits and imposes an impossibly tough schedule that would have killed anyone or driven them mad. Her field of expertise is Kokugo or Japanese language (English, in the live-action). She falls in love with Onizuka, but as both are quite reluctant to admit their affections and show them in the open, they claim they are \\"just friends\\". This friendship is not something major, except under the eyes of the cunning Suguru Teshigawara, who finds it most aggravating that a woman with her qualifications would fall in love with one with such a crude background as Onizuka. She has difficulty with the female students in her class, due to all the boys having crushes on her, but brings them around fairly quickly, after Onizuka's advice. She has a younger sister named Makoto Fuyutsuki.  Ryoko Sakurai  ; * *Japanese live-action actor: Yumi Shirakawa, Kuroki Hitomi (2012 remake) :Ryoko Sakurai is the director of the Holy Forest Academy. She is a caring woman who believes that Eikichi Onizuka and his \\"methods\\" will work positively for the school, contrary to the beliefs of the faculty. The only time in the series that she did not approve of his behavior is when Onizuka endangered her grandson, Mayu Wakui, but she later admits this is due to his manipulative nature. She is also Daimon Misuzu's former teacher.  Hiroshi Uchiyamada  ; * *Japanese live-action actor: Akira Nakao, Tayama Ryosei (2012 remake) :The vice-principal at the Holy Forest Academy, Hiroshi Uchiyamada is commonly seen throwing fits over two things: Onizuka the \\"parasite\\", and his beloved and frequently-totaled Toyota Cresta. :According to a self-explained biography in the manga, Uchiyamada was born and educated in a small rural town. He was discovered as a prodigy and recommended to become a teacher at the Tokyo College of Education, where he first met his wife-to-be, Ry≈çko. 29 years of hard work eventually earned him his current house and position at the Holy Forest Academy. His daughter is Yoshiko Uchiyamada. :Uchiyamada holds very conservative ideals on how peoples' backgrounds determine their future performance. Despite his attempts to thwart Onizuka's plans, Uchiyamada is not so much a classic villain than merely dogmatically serious about the job of teaching (at least in his mind). He is a not-quite-extreme example of the punishment an ordinary, older middle-aged, Japanese man takes from his home and workplace. He is forced to work with a young man like Onizuka, who easily breaks the rules and does things that don't make sense to him. His superior, Headmaster Ryoko Sakurai, seems to think it is fun to have a presence like Onizuka. At home, his wife, daughter, and dog openly disdain him in his often deluded imaginings, and feels that they're only satisfied with the luxuries that his work earns. :Uchiyamada eventually accepts Onizuka's views of teaching, when the latter yells at and punches Uchiyamada, when he interferes with Onizuka, trying to save Urumi Kanzaki, on the verge of death, for the sake of his job. As Onizuka takes Urumi to an ambulance Uchiyamada contemplates on his 29 years as a teacher and realizes that he had stopped caring for his students and more for his job, and he even decides to save Onizuka from being fired. With Onizuka's help, he also reconciles with his family, though he remains viciously defensive, when Onizuka tries to make a move on his daughter. :A running gag in the manga has Onizuka constantly destroying Uchiyamada's Cresta, mostly as a side effect of rescuing students, such as falling from the top of the school building and landing on the car. Another running gag involves Uchiyamada frequently getting injured, or assaulted by accident, from an oblivious Onizuka.  Suguru Teshigawara  ; * *Japanese live-action actor: Kunihiko Ida, Yano Masato (2012 remake) :Suguru Teshigawara is a ruthless, perfectionist mathematics teacher and a cum laude graduate of Tokyo University. He grew up trying to follow in the footsteps of his successful, older brother and father, the latter of whom is a high-ranking Parliament minister. He dresses very neatly and even wears a white velvet glove ‚Äì his symbol of perfection. :Teshigawara is obsessed with Azusa Fuyutsuki and her dedication and relatively clean, prestigious background ‚Äì far past the point of stalking. The walls of his apartment, which overlooks Azusa's, is completely covered with photos of her, and keeps tabs on her every move in her apartment, with extensive surveillance equipment. He even has a large pillow with a full-body shot of Azusa imprinted onto it. Suguru ends up having to drape white cloth all over the walls to conceal his fetish, when he tries to invite her over to his apartment. :Teshigawara absolutely loathes Eikichi Onizuka, not only because of his poor educational background, but because his students love him, and Azusa appears to love Onizuka more. As a result of his hatred, he pulls in a favor with the head of a local Parent-Teacher Association group, the mother of Hidemi Ohta, a student he tutors, whose father is a member of Japanese Parliament, eventually leading Onizuka to take a national high-school aptitude test, to prove he is capable of teaching. Sadly for Teshigawara, Onizuka places first nationally, keeping his position, much to his dismay and frustration. It is later revealed (exclusive to the manga) that his mental instability and fanatical perfectionism arose from the pressures placed on him by his father, who expected him to never fail at anything. His failures in his love life corroded his sanity which led him to kidnap Azusa and then failing that, to take over the school and declare it an independent country.  Hajime Fukuroda  ; * *Japanese live-action actor: Sugi-chan (2012 version) :The stereotypically macho-muscular gym coach at the Holy Forest Academy, Hajime Fukuroda (more commonly known as \\"Moleface\\", due to a rather large mole on the side of his cheek) is a graduate of a prestigious physical education academy. Fukuroda admires his body and does his very best to keep it, and those of his pupils (the female ones, in particular), in tip-top shape. He even enjoys famously macho theme songs at karaoke bars with his colleagues. However, he also has a closeted sexual longing for young girls ‚Äì in his case, the aforementioned female students. He also as a curious habit of doing pushups when under extreme stress.  Tadashi Sakurai  ; * :The 42-year-old English teacher at the Holy Forest Academy, Tadashi Sakurai is not very fluent at the language he teaches. His last name was changed to Sakurada in the anime, in order to avoid confusion with Headmaster Ryoko Sakurai, with whom he shares no relation. Though he makes few appearances in the earlier volumes of the manga, he gets a more important role when Miyabi Aizawa blackmails him into embezzling the funds for the class trip. :In the manga, Miyabi uses Sakurai's fetish for looking up girls' skirts in the bathroom stalls, with a hidden camera, as blackmail, and his downfall comes at the hands of the police. In the anime, Miyabi blackmails Sakurai with pictures showing him as a cross-dresser, and he simply flees from school. :A flashback in the manga reveals he was bullied a lot during his high school years. He sent a love letter to a girl, but she didn't share Sakurai's feelings, and as a result was beaten up by his male peers for even sending the letter, in the first place. One day, while Sakurai was skipping class, hiding in the boys' washroom stalls, the same girl needed to use the boys' washroom, because the girls' washroom smelled bad. Sakurai was able to watch her, leading to his fetish.  Naoko Moritaka  ; * *Japanese live-action actor: Takizawa Saori (2012 remake) :Naoko Moritaka is the eccentric, school nurse at Holy Forest Academy. Often acting as the teachers' muse, Naoko is quite helpful and knows her trade well, though she seems to derive some erotic pleasure from her regular blood donations. She's extremely attractive, and Azusa Fuyutsuki notes that she's heard \\"quite a few love confessions\\" about her from students. :In the anime, she is replaced by a former street racing queen named Nao Kadena (originally from Shonan Junai Gumi, the prequel to GTO), who took the nursing position at the Holy Forest Academy, in order to help pay for her brother's surgery ‚Äì a result of him racing in her place.  Itagaki  ; :Itagaki was originally one of Headmaster Sakurai's attendants, until he appeared to work for Misuzu Daimon, so as to help her rid the school of any useless teachers and students. However, it was Headmaster Ryoko Sakurai who ordered him to do so, as a ruse for Daimon to keep an eye on her and her actions. He was the one who gives a software CD to Takumi Ishida, a former student from Holy Forest, to shut down Daimon's network and surveillance control over the school.  Misuzu Daimon  ; *Japanese live-action actor: Nishida Naomi (2012 remake) :Misuzu Daimon is the new vice-principal, hired during the second semester, after Vice-Principal Ippachi Maruyama's transfer. She was placed by the board, in order to weaken the position of Headmaster Ryoko Sakurai and to force Eikichi Onizuka to leave. To that end, she deploys a school wide intranet and gives each student and faculty member a palm device. Additionally, she institutes a point system for the faculty, in an attempt to cause Onizuka's resignation and employs a special force in the school known as the \\"Angels\\", to further control the school and its faculty. One particular Angel, Sho Shibuya, regards her as a surrogate mother and the only person he has no animosity towards. She sees school as nothing more than a business, and deems personal things like friendship to be utter nonsense and unrealistic in real life, this outlook on life stems from her time in her high school, where she was always the butt of bullying and cruel verbal abuse by her classmates because of her excellent academic performance, and also due to the escalating rumors that her parents were incarcerated in prison (according to the rumors, they were both arsonists, although this was never explicitly proven). However, through it all she was able to overcome only most of the pain through her teacher at that time; Ryoko, who gave her sincere support. In a moment of weakness, she set her school on fire, and was set to die if it wasn't for Ryoko rescuing her. However, she wasn't able to remember exactly who rescued her at that time, assuming that the fire fighters were the ones responsible for that, but it would only be years later that she would find out the truth from Ryoko herself. Holy Forest Academy students=Class 3‚Äì4 Noboru Yoshikawa = ; * *Japanese live-action actor: Shun Oguri, Taishi Nakagawa (2012 remake) :Noboru Yoshikawa is a student at the Holy Forest Academy, and did not have a good time before Eikichi Onizuka arrived, being the victim of bullying, mostly from Anko Uehara and her group (Miyabi Aizawa replaces Anko's role in the live-action on GTO 1998 Series). He is extremely good with video games and is somewhat of an otaku, but proves to be quite handy with making things. He also has an eye for girls and pays a lot of attention to them, as seen when Aizawa's plan to charge Onizuka with embezzlement when the group tries to identify the girls Aizawa paid to follow her plan. :Anko's bullying is so bad it included bruises over most of his body as well as writing made with permanent marker around his private parts, it makes Noboru attempt to commit suicide twice, both times by leaping off the roof of the school, and both times resulting in him being saved by Onizuka, at the cost of Vice-Principal Hiroshi Uchiyamada's car (note that only the second attempt was caused by Anko's gang in the manga version; Noboru mentions some thugs in Class 2 as the cause of his first attempt). The two strike a quick friendship, which works for Onizuka, as Noboru has plenty of items that he wants to \\"borrow\\". His loyalty to Onizuka is by far the strongest, seen when he willingly sells his game collection to help cover Onizuka's debt. :While on the school trip to Okinawa, he gets room assigned with Anko and her friends by Onizuka. In retaliation for Onizuka and Noboru's antics, he gets tied up and led away into the dense jungle by the girls, but they all end up getting lost and rely on him for help. Despite the abuse, he saves Anko's life after she falls off a cliff, getting separated from the others. As the rest of the events of the manga unfolds, Noboru begins to enjoy Anko's company enough that she begins to feel affectionate to him. = Anko Uehara = ; * *Japanese live-action actor: Yua Shinkawa (2012 remake) :Anko Uehara is an athletic girl with well-off parents who, like Kunio Murai, Miyabi Aizawa and Ruruka Hikita, has her own trio, in which she is accompanied by Naoko Asano and Mayuko Izumi. :Anko is one of the first of the class to start trouble for Eikichi Onizuka, due to her and her friends' constant mistreatment of Noboru Yoshikawa. After the most recent assault on Noboru Yoshikawa leaving him severely beaten and humiliated yet again do they get taught a lesson by Onizuka, who literally spanks them at a karaoke bar and takes pictures of himself committing the act. Afterwards, Anko gets her mother, the president of the local Parent-Teacher Association, who believes her daughter is incapable of wrongdoing, to get Onizuka fired. This backfires, with the help of Noboru and Yoshito Kikuchi, who reveal her cruel, bullying nature in front of the student body and PTA. Anko tearfully confronts her mother about their relationship and perfectionist expectations of her, which leads to some family reconciliation and doesn't get any serious retribution from what she and her friends had done. :She and her friends keep their distance from any other attempts by students to get Onizuka fired, despite giving their verbal support. While still cold to Onizuka, Anko allies with him, after being fed up with Miyabi Aizawa's manipulation of others for her own gain. When Onizuka is framed for embezzling funds for the school trip, she offers her credit card for use, but he flat-out refuses. :On the school field trip to Okinawa, her mean streak towards Noboru continues to persist, even escalating, as he and Onizuka start playing pranks of their own against her and her friends. In an ironic twist, Noboru saves her life, after her own prank fails. During a near-death experience, a flashback reveals her bullying stems from growing up with an abusive, older brother, who in turn, was abused by their father. :Shortly after, she develops feelings for him, and unsuccessfully tries to deny them. It takes an Onizuka scheme to get her to admit it. = Kunio Murai = ; * *Japanese live-action actor: Hiroyuki Ikeuchi, Shintaro Morimoto (2012 remake) :The class \\"jock bully\\", Kunio Murai is not very bright and loses his temper easily. When Eikichi Onizuka arrives at the Holy Forest Academy, Kunio and his gang (consisting of Kouji Fujiyoshi and Tadaaki Kusano) attempt to kill him several times with seemingly innocent pranks, such as a cockroach planted in his school lunch. The plans backfire (such as Kunio eating the cockroach, instead) and he goes insane, nearly ending up with his face impaled on a pair of razor-sharp scissors. Onizuka then takes advantage of Kunio's 27-year-old mother, Julia Murai, after trouncing Kunio at several arcade games. It is later revealed that Julia was carrying her son at the age of 13, and her parents and boyfriend abandoned her, making Kunio overprotective of his mother. :Kunio and his gang befriend Onizuka (inadvertently becoming his \\"partners in crime\\" whenever he is up to his antics), after he saves them from a group of ruffians, but not before Onizuka joins the ruffians and has Kunio bungee-jump off the Tokyo Bay Bridge. Kunio still gets very angry when Onizuka tries to make a pass at his mother, especially with the possibility that Onizuka may very well be his new stepfather. His fear of a new father also rears its head when he suspects his mother may be marrying a man who resembles Dr. Elefun from Astro Boy. = Kouji Fujiyoshi = ; * *Japanese live-action actor: Yuki Yamada (2012 remake) :Kouji Fujiyoshi is part of Kunio Murai's gang, usually tagging along with him and Tadaaki Kusano. He was an unwitting part of Miyabi Aizawa and Tadashi Sakurai's plan to get rid of Eikichi Onizuka, by making him collect money for the annual school trip and then lose it. The money was planted into Onizuka's jacket, which he quickly spent in one night, thus leading to Onizuka being charged with embezzlement. Feeling responsible because he had also stolen some of the money to buy a new watch, Fujiyoshi dropped out temporarily and worked to earn the money back, and his actions helped lead to a school trip to Okinawa, courtesy of Onizuka. :He is also romantically interested in Miyabi, to the point of hijacking a car to get her to take a ride with him. = Tadaaki Kusano = ; * *Japanese live-action actor: Suzuki Nobuyuki (2012 remake) :Tadaaki Kusano is part of Kunio Murai's gang, usually tagging along with him and Kouji Fujiyoshi. He doesn't do much, except help Murai with his mischief. He is quite attracted to Ai Tokiwa, to the point of obsession, even stealing her socks. Unfortunately, Daimon Misuzu's Angels used this to their advantage, and accuse him of also stealing her urine sample. His mother, in stark contrast to Murai's mother, is a rather portly woman that he seems quite ashamed of. = Tomoko Nomura = ; * *Japanese live-action actor: Miki Kuroda, Miyazaki Karen (2012 remake) :A student in Eikichi Onizuka's class, Tomoko Nomura has a large chest (her cup size is F), but is not too bright, leading to people calling her Toro-ko (Toro meaning \\"slow\\" in Japanese; she is nicknamed Slo-mo-ko in the English version). After initially messing up her role in one of Miyabi Aizawa's plans to get Onizuka fired, she is cut off from Miyabi's group. Seeing her rather slow, clumsy nature, Onizuka enters her into a local beauty contest. He even arranges two porn producer friends to dress her up for the competition. Rather than read the given script for the acting category, Onizuka gives her a couple of action figures and she ends up doing an excellent improvised piece (with Vice-Principal Uchiyamada getting an accidental role). In the anime, Onizuka throws a cellphone on stage and she leaves a sentimental message on Miyabi's answering machine instead. She doesn't win, but she gets noticed by several television producers and begins starring in various commercials. Her young male manager, impressed with her natural beauty, and after falling in love at first sight, makes it his lifetime goal to help her succeed. :She was friends with Urumi Kanzaki since childhood, and their close bond likely arose out of their opposite personalities (Tomoko is clumsy and rather docile with a heart of gold, compared to Urumi's intellect and potential to be savagely cruel). :A side- story in the manga features Tomoko and her manager, also called GTO, only it stands for Great Tomoko Oppai (Oppai meaning breasts). In it, Tomoko's manager embarks on one very madcap adventure to save her from her dubious producers. = Miyabi Aizawa = ; * *Japanese live-action actor: Aimi Nakamura, Kawaguchi Haruna (2012 remake) :Miyabi Aizawa is another student in Eikichi Onizuka's class and hates all teachers severely. She is easily the most popular girl in school, though her queen-like manner can irritate anyone. At the beginning, she appears to be the ringleader of the classmates that want to get rid of Onizuka. Like Anko Uehara and Kunio Murai, she has her own crime trio, with Saeko Ijima and Chikako Shirai. She also used Tomoko Nomura for a blackmail trap against Onizuka, but the attempt is foiled and she expels her from the group, putting the blame solely on Tomoko. Originally just out to be rid of Onizuka on principle, she quickly makes it personal, when she loses to the Onizuka-sponsored Tomoko at a beauty contest. :Miyabi is also behind the school trip funds embezzlement, where she blackmails Tadashi Sakurai into asking parents to submit the money in cash, and has Sakurai put Kouji Fujiyoshi in charge of collecting it. This allows her to steal the money from Fujiyoshi by cunningly playing on his family's tight financial situation, then planting it on Onizuka, who manages to lose it all in a step up, involving a faux female student hostess club and drugged drinks. However, Urumi Kanzaki, wanting to aid Onizuka in paying off the debt, cruelly sets her and her two friends up with an S&M; group, where she is narrowly saved from being raped, when Onizuka crashes into their room of their hotel through the window after swinging from a rope, suspended by a blimp, all the way from another skyscraper. Of course, before he could actually save them, he demanded a sincere apology from Miyabi (in the anime, Urumi hires a group of yakuza, instead). :Urumi later insults Miyabi at a carnival, leading her to reveal Urumi's secret. Urumi retaliates by posting a website where it claims to post pictures of Miyabi in the bathroom taken with a hidden camera. Miyabi attempts to commit suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills, but survives. The website is revealed to be a ruse. :Miyabi was the one who led class 2-4 (as they were known then) onto the path of terrorizing teachers (previously, it was only Urumi who would occasionally do the terrorizing). Her motives behind this, however, varies between the manga and the anime. ::In the anime, Miyabi was a model student, who turns this way due to a teacher who indirectly caused one of her closest friends to commit suicide, over an illicit affair between them. This, compounded by her family problems, became the root cause of Miyabi's mistrust (and often outright hate) for all adults. Her personal convictions are shattered, when she was accused of attempting to murder the aforementioned teacher, as well as assaulting a member of the Japanese Board of Education (who she sees as taking only the teacher's side). She is shocked when Onizuka takes the fall for her, by announcing he committed all of the crimes she was accused of. Arriving in time to see Onizuka being led away in handcuffs, Miyabi finally asks Onizuka to forgive her for everything she had done. One would assume that this event has restored in Miyabi the capacity to trust in adults again. :In the manga, Miyabi had a crush on their former, homeroom teacher, ≈ågi, and started to believe that her feelings may be reciprocated, when he invites her to dinner. However, ≈ågi already had a fianc√©, whom he wanted to introduce to Miyabi. Crushed, she takes illicit photographs of herself (knowing that his hobby was photography) and tells the class that he took advantage of her. Things go out of hand when classmate Takumi Ishida takes matters into his own hands and assaults ≈ågi. Distraught over the events (≈ågi and Takumi were fired and expelled, respectively), Miyabi decides to turn the class against all teachers, thus beginning class 2-4's rebellion. :Miyabi's guilt, as well as her deteriorating family situation, makes her colder and distant to friends and classmates, leading to the events in the carnival and her rivalry with Urumi, mentally breaking her down. Her guilt is further compounded when she discovers just how much her friends still care for her. Things take a turn for the worse when she returns to her already broken family, forcing Onizuka to intervene, which results in him and a few students holding Miyabi \\"hostage\\", on the condition that her father demonstrates his love for her. The plot works, but this doesn't please Misuzu Daimon and her Angels, who then expose Miyabi's secret, forcing her to attempt a suicide from the school roof, but before that happens, Takumi, who had flown in from Okinawa, appears on the roof, to try to convincing her not to jump, despite the guilt she feels for all she's done. However, Onizuka accidentally bumps her off the ledge. Miyabi, not willing to end her life, after having settled her guilt, calls out to him, who leaps after her, landing on Uchiyamada's Cresta. = Urumi Kanzaki = ; * *Japanese live-action actor: Honda Tsubasa (2012 remake) :The antithesis to the \\"dumb blonde\\" stereotype, Urumi Kanzaki is a prodigy, with an IQ over 200. She is also a heterochromatic, possessing different colored eyes: one brown and one blue. However, she is psychologically disturbed, having her fair share of hate toward teachers. Her genius is displayed repeatedly by such abstract actions as the detonation of time bombs (i.e. firecrackers in disposable boxes) and making a harmless snake look like a cobra using paper cutouts. Her intellect is also shown through actions, such as shouting curse words in French and being able to speak fluent Mandarin. On the trip in Okinawa, Yoshito Kikuchi noted that she can speak 5 languages, but ironically, she doesn't understand what her Gundam otaku roommates say. :Her hatred for teachers stems from her time in elementary school. Urumi's teacher, Ms. Fujimori, while initially welcoming and receptive, wasn't able to handle her intellect properly, since she went to a second-rate college, and it was her first year teaching. Urumi's constant requests for the teacher's time, both inside and outside of school, as well as the fact that the lessons she wanted to learn from the teacher included extremely advanced, college-level subjects (such as differential calculus) eventually made the teacher snap. When Urumi interrupted Ms. Fujimori's lecture to correct her in front of the whole class, the teacher then told Urumi's secret to her class. While it isn't stated explicitly, it can be deduced that her intelligence is derived from her biological father, when Urumi tells Eikichi Onizuka that her mother had selected a sperm-donor, based on his intellect and nothing more. It is even suggested that her mother took the sperm from an American scientific genius (this information can be gleaned from a scene where Urumi and her mother visited some friends in the United States, and Urumi was led into a dark storage room by a doctor, who explains to her that her father is actually just a bottle of donated sperm); this also explains Urumi's natural, blond hair. Naturally, this caused a great deal of psychological trauma to Urumi, and quite an understandable hatred of teachers. It is still unclear what happened to Ms. Fujimori, as her last appearances in the storyline was begging Onizuka to help Urumi before something terrible happens to her. :She is later found by Miyabi in a small apartment, and hired to torture Onizuka. Formerly a student at Holy Forest for a while, but stopped attending regularly after some time, she begins almost immediately, as she frames him for lechery and sends him to jail overnight, only to appear in class and on his homeroom roster the morning after. Onizuka's frustration with her vastly increases, when Vice-Principal Uchiyamada strictly advises him that he cannot inflict physical harm on her due, to her educational potential. Urumi is eventually able to turn Onizuka into her slave (more-or-less, her \\"genie\\") by threatening to have him arrested, after she fakes her death when he accidentally pushes her off a building. :However, all this changes when she encounters her Ms. Fujimori again, awakening her deepest hatred and causing her to direct her wrath at the student body. Onizuka responds by bringing his biker gang to school and \\"kidnaps\\" her from class. He is finally able to get through to her by almost killing the two of them by jumping over ‚Äì and nearly falling into ‚Äì a gap at a suspension bridge, despite her attempts to convince him that she is not afraid of anything, including death. Onizuka makes her see past her trauma, however bad, just isn't worth messing up the present with (in the manga, he does this by having his biker friends share their life experiences with her). Inspired, she allies with Onizuka, and helps with his troubles. :Despite her switch in allegiance, Urumi continues her feud with Miyabi, until Miyabi reveals her origins to the student body. Urumi retaliates by setting up a web page, where she promises to post pictures of Miyabi in her bathroom (Urumi had earlier placed a hidden camera), after a countdown timer reaches zero. However, the site reveals only a single photograph of Urumi, Miyabi, and Tomoko Nomura during their younger years. Urumi never had any intention of ruining Miyabi; she just wanted to scare her. Urumi attempts suicide at an indoor skiing arena by freezing to death, but Onizuka rescues her. It is after this incident that Urumi considers Onizuka to be her \\"favorite\\". :She grows extremely infatuated with Onizuka, to the point of wanting to elope with Onizuka. Urumi takes a more stereotypical role of a character that prefers the use of violence, in response to jealousy ‚Äì she is often seen beating Onizuka mercilessly every time he tries to fulfill his pervertedness. Urumi states Onizuka should wait for her hormones to start kicking in, because she's sure that she would have a bouncing body by then. Like Noboru Yoshikawa, her loyalty to Onizuka is extremely strong, to the point that she would consider suicide, if he were to die, feeling that her own life is worthless without him around. = Yoshito Kikuchi = ; * *Japanese live-action actor: Yosuke Kubozuka, Takada Sho (2012 remake) :Yoshito Kikuchi is one of Eikichi Onizuka's students. This computer prodigy (scoring the highest without certain \\"aid\\" in the country, on a standardized test) serves as class president and is also notorious for making pornographic composite photos, during Onizuka's arrival at the Holy Forest Academy. He tries to blackmail him into resignation with several pictures posted all across the school for everyone to see. Onizuka catches Kikuchi and instead of punishing him, hires him to make composite pictures of Azusa Fuyutsuki and other female teachers, much to his surprise. :Kikuchi is eventually the second person to befriend Onizuka, and later helps Noboru Yoshikawa prevent Anko Uehara's mother, the president of the local Parent-Teacher Association, from getting Onizuka fired. Kikuchi is an amateur martial artist, having prior experience in judo and other techniques learned from Mayu Wakui (in the live-action, he claims he only knows it, and does not demonstrate this claim). It is revealed after the examinations that he was the one who switched Onizuka's test papers for a perfect score. When questioned about the actual results that Onizuka has, Kikuchi calculates it himself, and is thoroughly surprised at the score (it is unknown whether Onizuka actually did score perfect, or a score befitting his intelligence), and asks him directly, to which his teacher replies that he definitely received a perfect score. :In the manga, a possible relationship is hinted between him and Ai Tokiwa, after some intervention and a forced embrace from Onizuka. In the live-action, Kikuchi has a long distance relationship with Tomoko Nomura. = Mayu Wakui = ; *Japanese live-action actor: Shono Hayama (2012-SP Episode) :The grandson of Headmaster Sakurai, Mayu Wakui attended Holy Forest Academy, until the incident involving Miyabi Aizawa and ≈ågi left their class scarred and traumatized. Continuing with Miyabi's scheming to get rid of Eikichi Onizuka, she calls on Mayu's aid to return to Holy Forest and get him removed. This handsome, mischievous, unprecedented young man accepts and immediately rubs Onizuka the wrong way, which forces Sakurai to chastise his actions. Vice-Principal Hiroshi Uchiyamada takes the opportunity to suspend Onizuka, but the decision is overturned, when Sakurai, who knows her grandson needs to cease his self- destruction, begs Onizuka to try and bring him back onto the straight path. :After unsuccessful attempts to have Onizuka out of the picture, Onizuka decides to settle their feud with a 100-man arm-wrestling match. Onizuka comes out undefeated, with Mayu left as his one hundredth opponent. Already physically and mentally unstable, he collapses. At the hospital, it is revealed he has been taking tryptophan, an emotional stabilizer, to treat his anxiety issues, but exactly what is the cause behind his condition is never revealed (there are several allusions where he speaks with Yoshito Kikuchi on the subject of dying young). There is also the suggestion that his instability is due to some familial or societal factor, when he explains that with enough finances from becoming a teen idol (he is in the same agency as Tomoko Nomura), he can expose those that have harmed him publicly. Additionally, a cover-up involving Mayu may explain his ready access to large sums of money, although he already comes from a wealthy background. :Seeing how Onizuka has proved his worth, Mayu relents and stops his pranking, stating that he's glad to have met Onizuka, but it would have been better if he had known his teacher sooner. Although Mayu does not return to class, he occasionally shows up to assist Onizuka, whenever it appears the odds are against him, in terms of manpower. = Y≈´ki Miyamori = ; *Japanese live-action actor: Utsumi Akiyoshi (2012 remake) :Enrolled in Eikichi Onizuka's class, but never shows up, Y≈´ki Miyamori is the son of the head of the local yakuza. When his \\"friends\\" did not show up for his mother's funeral (he claims they were only \\"friends\\", because of his father's status as a yakuza member), he became withdrawn and isolated, displaying symptoms of hikikomori. Onizuka only knew of his existence when he tried to get some high points in the point system, set up by Misuzu Daimon. One of the criteria to get more than 100 points is to persuade a student who has not attended class for over a year to return, thus, Onizuka sets out to bring Y≈´ki back. :Despite his family background, he is an ordinary boy who likes to play video games and would sneak out every 15th and 20th of each month in order to buy timetables for the bullet train. Onizuka and Noboru Yoshikawa manages to talk him out of his seclusion, saving Onizuka's salary in the process. He strikes a quick friendship with Noboru, when he returns to Holy Forest, and becomes somewhat of a defender of the weak, mostly via namedropping of his father's profession to frighten the school bullies. = Ai Tokiwa = ; *Japanese live-action actor: Bando Nozomi (2012 remake) :A transfer student to Eikichi Onizuka's class during the second semester and one of Misuzu Daimon's \\"Angels\\", Ai Tokiwa is adept at Tae Kwon Do, and holds an extreme grudge towards men, willing injuring them, no matter who it is. When Yoshito Kikuchi sees pass her innocent persona, Ai knocks him out cold, with the notion that he should inform Onizuka of what she's doing. After incurring the wrath of several high school students, they enter Holy Forest to confront Ai, with the intention of beating her to a pulp. Onizuka, with some help from Mayu Wakui and his friends, evens out the odds, while Onizuka heads to settle her personal demons. :Ai reveals that prior to joining the Angels, she was gang raped by her ex-boyfriend and his buddies. Feeling insecure around any boy, Daimon recruited her into the Angels, allowing her to inforce her vengeance back at men. Onizuka sees through this fa√ßade ‚Äì Ai is but a simple, frightened little girl, who only uses violence to deal, rather than cry it out. Realizing the truth, she breaks down and heavily cries. To make things up to her, Onizuka forces an embrace between her and Kikuchi, and though the two don't share mutual feelings for one another, it is hinted through the rest of the manga there is some form of affection and care between them. Ai summarily drops out of the Angels, and her allegiance with Daimon. = Sho Shibuya = ; *Japanese live-action actor: Sh≈´hei Nomura (2012 remake) :Sho Shibuya is a transfer student to Eikichi Onizuka's class and the leader of Misuzu Daimon's \\"Angels\\". In his former school, he was bullied to the point of insanity, reinforced with a flashback where he is stripped down to his underwear, with his classmates and even his teacher writing obscenities and symbols on his body with permanent markers. His own parents even thought of institutionalizing him, but instead, gave total guardianship over to Daimon. For this reason, he has a severe fear of parental abandonment, and keeps a tight, obedient relationship with Daimon (it is implied in another flashback that he was sexually abused by his mother, leading to a murder-suicide attempt that brought Daimon into his life as his counselor, before claiming guardianship status). = Takumi Ishida = ; *Japanese live-action actor: Gaku Sano (2012 remake) :A former student of Class 2-4, Takumi Ishida was expelled from Holy Forest after assaulting their homeroom teacher, ≈ågi, with a baseball bat, when Miyabi Aizawa claimed accusations of rape. Although ≈ågi revealed what really had happened, Takumi, feeling too guilty for his actions, retreated to Okinawa. However, he still kept in touch with Yoshito Kikuchi, using the pseudonym, Sunakujira (Sand Whale, in the English translations), and assists him throughout the series (Kikuchi did not know Takumi was Sunakujira). When Miyabi reveals the rape incident was a lie and attempts to set things right through suicide, Takumi returns to Holy Forest to convince her not to do it. :He assists Itagake Kinoshita, when he is handed a CD program to shut down Misuzu Daimon's network and surveillance control over the school. Takumi questions Itagake's motives behind this, since he was working for Daimon, but shrugs it off, realizing these events mean next to nothing to him. Friends of Onizuka= Ryuji Danma  ; * *Japanese live-action actor: Shirota Yu (2012 remake) :Ryuji Danma is Eikichi Onizuka's drinking buddy and partner during their days known as the \\"Onibaku\\" in Shonan Junai Gumi that GTO is a sequel of. In the years since he went \\"straight\\", Ryuji has set up his own used motorcycle shop and profits greatly from it. He is the one who refers Onizuka to Holy Forest Academy, when he forgets to take the public teachers' civil service exam. :Ryuji is not averse to showing Onizuka some tough love, such as refusing to lend him any money to cover the cost of the school trip to Okinawa ‚Äì at least not until he clears up his own debts with Ryuji, although it can be interpreted that deep down, Ryuji is concerned for his friend's well-being; after all, the deeper the trouble Onizuka is in, the less likely Ryuji will ever see his money again.  Toshiyuki Saejima  ; * *Japanese live-action actor: Naohito Fujiki, Yusuke Yamamoto (2012 remake) :One of Eikichi Onizuka's and Ryuji Danma's old friends from their b≈çs≈çzoku days in Shonan Junai Gumi prequel to GTO, Toshiyuki Saejima is a corrupt police officer, and spends his time selling seized police evidence. He tries to convince Onizuka to buy into his scams, such as selling goods off the locker, Mercedes-Benz vehicles, counterfeit Prada handbags, handguns, poppies, pandas, Chinese immigrants among other things and \\"testing\\" out weapons from crime scenes. He apparently also hires prostitutes on a regular basis, and attempts to get Onizuka to join in his operations, so as cut costs. :Unlike Ryuji and Onizuka, Saejima seems to have difficulty in letting go of his b≈çs≈çzoku ways. Aside from his illegalities, he is willing to execute the psychotic Suguru Teshigawara in cold blood, during his rampage, so as to get a promotion, but also justifying it as \\"protecting the kiddies\\". Despite his ways, deep down, he is a good and reliable friend that Onizuka can count on and will always be there for him, even if it means his job (or his well being). Other characters= Nanako Mizuki  ; * *Japanese live-action actor: Kirari, Tanuichi Risa (2012 remake) :Nanako Mizuki is a student at the Musashino Public High School, in a class of troublemakers that Eikichi Onizuka is assigned to for teacher training. Initially, she agrees to set Onizuka up, seducing him into taking her back to his apartment, where she undresses for him. At that moment, some of the boys from the class take a picture of Onizuka and Nanako together, threatening to release it to the media, if he doesn't pay a large sum of money. However, Onizuka is able to \\"persuade\\" the boys to keep quiet, with a little help from his old biker gang. :Despite the set-up, Onizuka agrees to take Nanako back to his apartment, after she insinuates he might be able to sleep with her. However, this is just a ruse, when she explains that due to her parents having no time for family bonding anymore, because of their tight jobs, Onizuka's small apartment reminds her of the time when her family used to live in these conditions and were much closer. This moment sparked Onizuka's revelation of actively resisting the urge to sleep with his female students. :Onizuka solves her problem by walking into Nanako's home with a sledgehammer, bashing a hole in the wall separating her parents' bedrooms, assuring her the wall will not act as a barrier between Nanako and her parents. Her parents have the physical hole filled, but she realizes that time and her efforts can heal the spiritual rift in their relationship. To show her appreciation, she briefly, and without panties, flashes for Onizuka, promising that he'll be the one to take her virginity. She does not reappear in the manga or anime, after this.  Yoshiko Uchiyamada  ; * *Japanese live- action actor: Erika Mabuchi, Komatsu Mizuki (2012 remake) :The daughter of Hiroshi Uchiyamada, Yoshiko Uchiyamada is into designer handbags, ganguro fashion, and according to her father, \\"single handedly keeps the tanning salon industry alive\\". Although Eikichi Onizuka abstained from any sexual relations with students, he and Yoshiko meet at a karaoke place and strike a quick friendship, the connotations of which severely anger her father. The \\"gap\\" between Yoshiko and her father is already large to begin with, as she openly disdains him for his deluded imaginings and not living up to her own material expectations. :It is implied in the manga that she may not be Hiroshi Uchiyamada's biological daughter, but the meat delivery man's, though this could be argued as another one of Uchiyamada's paranoid delusions.  Julia Murai  ; * *Japanese live-action actor: Rikako Murakami, Yoshida Yo (2012 remake) :Kunio Murai's, 27 year-old Julia Murai carried Kunio at the age of thirteen, and chose to run away to be able to keep him, when her parents disowned her and Kunio's father abandoned her. Julia works as a crane operator at a local construction yard, and is known to wearing skimpy outfits and no bra. On occasion she would also model bridal gowns for her boss (which led her son to think she will be married to a man who looks like Dr. Elefun). Although Eikichi Onizuka swore off relations with female students, their mothers are still available, thus, he attempts to woo her on multiple occasions, even asking her out once.

In 1997 the series won the New Manga Artist Award. Plot The series centers around Mitsuo Shiozu, a lonely high school student who has the psychic ability to see \\"spirits\\" who can use him to interact and communicate with the living world for a purpose. These purposes usually don't go very well for Mitsuo, but the spirits seem to be able to do what they need to do to move on. They also lead Mitsuo to quite a few admirers‚Äìof the male gender. The story is mostly lighthearted, and much of its humor comes from the awkward and embarrassing situations and misunderstandings the characters find themselves in. The manga itself is sh≈çnen-ai yet also a parody on sh≈çnen-ai storylines and stereotypes.  Characters ;Mitsuo Shiozu :The main character of Eerie Queerie, Mitsuo Shiozu is a high school student with special abilities: he can interact with ghosts. Unfortunately, this can work against him, as it leaves him vulnerable to being possessed by ghosts who frequently use his body to fulfill their means. The resulting exploits make up much of the humor in the series. Besides attracting ghosts, Mitsuo inadvertently attracts the attentions of the guys around him, and his na√Øvete only enhances his appeal in their eyes. He develops a crush on Hasunuma as the story progresses, but doesn't realize it consciously. However, Mitsuo becomes incredibly violent and protective whenever someone else flirts with Hasunuma. Mitsuo's character is a parody on a stereotypical uke character. Throughout the manga he tries to prove his masculinity, without succeeding. ;Hasunuma :In Book 1, Mitsuo is possessed by the ghost of a girl, Kiyomi, who, in her lifetime, had a crush on Hasunuma and regrets having never told him. Kiyomi uses Mitsuo's body to make her feelings known to Hasunuma. Of course, his classmates think that it is in fact Mitsuo himself professing his love to Hasunuma, and decide he must be gay (a belief that Mitsuo fights against in vain). Hasunuma, however, apparently realizes the truth of the matter, and dispels the ghost from Mitsuo's body by using charm cards. He turns out to have a decent amount of knowledge about spirits, and therefore proves useful in helping Mitsuo. Hasunuama is a parody on seme a stereotype in Sh≈çnen-Ai stories. :Unknown to Mitsuo (for the majority of the 4 books, at least), Hasunuma is interested in Mitsuo, and looks out for him, once even jumping out of an upstairs window to save him and later crossdressing to protect Mitsuo's reputation. Mitsuo also begins to have feelings for Hasunuma, but attempts to hide them out of fear, uncertainty, and his own fabricated reason of concern for Hasunuma's 'feelings'. :At the end of the series there is a gag comic that refers to the fact that Hasunuma's full name has never been revealed. When he attempts to inform Mitsuo of his full name, Hasunuma's attempts are bleeped out as if he was being censored for bad language. The other characters theorize that his name must be something naughty while Hasunuma asserts that his name is not anything bad and is just a normal name. ;Ichi Shirai :Ichi is a fellow student at Mitsuo's school, introduced in Book 1. He is haunted by his past, and believes himself a murderer because when he played soccer one time, he kicked his ball out into the road. Ichi's secret crush, Natsuko, ran after it to pick it up, and was run over by a truck while attempting to do so. Ichi continues to blame himself for Natsuko's death until Natsuko herself returns as a ghost through Mitsuo, to Ichi, telling him that she forgives him, and entreats him to stop feeling guilty and start playing soccer again. After this, Ichi becomes friends with Mitsuo, and later develops a crush on him. Because of this, he is a rival of Hasunuma's and the two regard each other with suspicion. ;Hibiki Kanau :Kanau is a ghost haunting Mitsuo's high school. He had a tragic death, in which he and his senpai had agreed on committing a double suicide by jumping off a bridge. However, at the last moment, his senpai could not bring himself to do this, and turned away, but by this time Kanau had already jumped. :Kanau is very jealous of Hasunuma's intense love for Mitsuo; the sort of love he was denied in his lifetime. Kanau manages to push Mitsuo out of an upstairs window, but is shocked and guilty when Hasunuma, fearing for Mitsuo, jumps out as well. Eventually, Kanau becomes somewhat of a pet for Mikuni. ;Mikuni :Mikuni is the chief priest at a Shinto temple who makes his debut in Book 2. He possesses incredible spiritual powers and is very arrogant. Mikuni is also the source of much tension as he uses Mitsuo's na√Øvete to make Hasunuma and even Ichi jealous. At one point, Hasunuma, in spirit form, was Mikuni's servant until he was replaced by Kanau when he returned to his body. Mikuni is the most open of the characters because he makes it clear that his interest lies in boys. ;Itsuki :Itsuki makes his debut in Book 3, first appearing to the group when is found half-unconscious outside the shrine. He is a spiritual medium, a profession passed down from his family. His mother, who had died the week before he appears in the book, had been a shrine maiden, and had graduated as a koto player. His late father used to possess his body so he and his mother could speak to each other again. Mikuni attempts to further Itsuki's powers by trying to allow God to possess his body, though it ends in disaster. At one point, he explains through thought that his mother would always have this strange look in her eye that Shino later portrays. ;Shino :Shino also first appears in volume 3, as Mikuni's new shrine maiden. He doesn't speak to anyone, and he's constantly giving rather \\"strange\\" looks towards Itsuki. Later, Shino saves Itsuki when a desk almost falls on his head when Itsuki and Mikuni try to medium God, in the process giving himself a head injury. Itsuki carries Shino out of the \\"shrine of chaos\\", as all sorts of things flew around, and they ended up in the forest, where Shino kisses him, and speaks for the first time. Later, it is discovered that Shino was \\"stalking\\" Itsuki since the ninth grade, and the whole mute thing was part of his plan to intrigue Itsuki. Reception Critical reception for the series was mixed to positive, with Animefringe calling the first volume \\"entertaining\\" and \\"worth the low price\\".Eerie Queerie Vol. 1 Animefringe Anime News Network's Liann Cooper called the series' second volume \\"fun\\" but noted that \\"a series cannot survive on fanservice alone\\".RIGHT TURN ONLY!!

Sengyou proposed criteria for assessing the authenticity of Buddhist sutras at a time when many fake or apocryphal texts were in circulation.Storch 2014: 62 ff. He was particularly focussed on the translator of text, and this made him suspicious of unattributed texts. As Tanya Storch says, \\"Absence of information about the translator was a signal that it might be a compilation by a Chinese person who did not understand Sanskrit and had never studied Buddhism in the west [i.e. India].Storch 2014: 67.

The first entry in the Mother series, it was first released in Japan on July 27, 1989. It is modeled on the gameplay of the Dragon Quest series, but is set in the late 20th-century United States, unlike its fantasy genre contemporaries. Mother follows the young Ninten as he uses his great- grandfather's studies on psychic powers to fight hostile, formerly inanimate objects and other enemies. The game uses random encounters to enter a menu- based, first-person perspective battle system. Writer and director Shigesato Itoi pitched Mothers concept to Shigeru Miyamoto while visiting Nintendo's headquarters for other business. Though Miyamoto rejected the proposal at first, he eventually gave Itoi a development team. A North American version of the game was localized into English, but was abandoned as commercially nonviable. A copy of this prototype was later found and circulated on the Internet under the informal title EarthBound Zero. The game was eventually released worldwide under the name EarthBound Beginnings for the Wii U Virtual Console in June 2015. Mother was noted for its similarities to the Dragon Quest series and its simultaneous parody of the genre's tropes. Many considered its sequel EarthBound to be similar and a better overall implementation of Mother gameplay ideas. Critics disliked the game's high difficulty level and balance issues. Despite this, Mother sold over 150,000 copies and received a \\"Silver Hall of Fame\\" score from Japanese reviewer Weekly Famitsu. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com wrote that Mother importantly generated interest in video game emulation and the historical preservation of unreleased games. The game was later re-released in Japan on the single- cartridge compilation Mother 1+2 for the Game Boy Advance in 2003.  Gameplay  Mother is a single-player, role-playing video game set in a \\"slightly offbeat\\", late 20th-century United States as interpreted by Japanese author Shigesato Itoi. The game eschews traits of its Japanese role-playing game contemporaries: it is not set within the fantasy genre and only enters science fiction for its final sequence. The player fights in warehouses and laboratories instead of in standard dungeons. Instead of swords, assault weapons, and magic, the player uses baseball bats, toy guns, and psychic abilities. The game's protagonist, Ninten, is about 12 years old. Like the Dragon Quest series, Mother uses a random encounter combat system. The player explores the overworld from a top-down perspective and occasionally enters a first-person perspective battle sequence where the player chooses attack options from a series of menus. On their turn, the player selects between options to fight, guard, check enemy attributes, run away, use items, or use offensive, defensive, or healing psychic powers. The player can also set the battle on autopilot with the \\"auto\\" option. Critical hits register with the series' signature \\"SMAAAASH\\" text and sound. The player can press a button to have Ninten \\"check\\" or \\"talk\\" with nearby people, animals, and objects. The game shares similarities with its sequel, EarthBound: there is a game save option through using a phone to call Ninten's father, an option to store items with Ninten's sister at home, and an automated teller machine for banking money. The members of Ninten's party are all visible on the overworld screen at once, and are analogous to EarthBound party members in style and function. Mother world map does not keep locations separate, and instead connects all areas (akin to the Pok√©mon series games). The game's story begins as Ninten discovers a music box and receives the journal of his great-grandfather, who studied psychic powers nearly a century earlier. Ninten is attacked by household items, and ventures outside to find a crazy world with hostile everyday objects and other odd events.  Plot  Mother begins with the story of a young, married, American couple who mysteriously vanish from their small, rural town. Two years later, the husband, George, returned as mysteriously as he vanished, and began a strange study in complete seclusion. His wife, Maria, was never heard from again. Years later, in 1988 (changed to an ambiguous point in the 1980s in later releases), a young American boy named Ninten is attacked at home in a paranormal event. His father explains that Ninten's great-grandfather studied psychic powers, and asks Ninten to investigate a crisis occurring across the world, later revealed to be the work of an invading alien race. After finishing a few tasks, Ninten is warped to the world of Magicant, where the land's ruler, Queen Mary, asks Ninten to find her song, the Eight Melodies, and play them for her. Ninten returns to Earth and befriends a young boy, Lloyd, who is being teased at an elementary school. The two travel to the town of Snowman to deliver a lost hat to Ana, a young girl with psychic powers. Ana tells Ninten she saw him in a dream, and joins the party in hopes of finding her missing mother. Ninten and party exploring the overworld After finding most of the Melodies, Ninten is harassed at a karaoke bar by Teddy, the boss of a local gang. Teddy surrenders after losing to Ninten in a duel, and joins Ninten's party with the intent to avenge the deaths of his parents, who were killed at Holy Loly Mountain. Lloyd stays behind. In a cottage at the base of Holy Loly Mountain, Ana pulls Ninten aside and asks him to be with her always. The two dance and profess their mutual love. When about to leave, the party is attacked by a powerful robot that knocks out the entire party. Lloyd arrives with a tank and destroys the robot, but accidentally attacks the party and critically wounds Teddy, so Lloyd rejoins the party. They take a boat out on Holy Loly Lake and a whirlpool pulls them into an underwater laboratory, where they find a robot who claims to have been built by George to protect Ninten. When the laboratory floods, they leave for the mountain and the robot helps them ascend. Another robot (implied to be an upgraded version of the one fought at the cabin) attacks at the summit, and George's robot self-destructs to destroy it, leaving behind the seventh melody. After learning this melody, the party is warped to Magicant, where Ninten sings the melodies he had learned to Queen Mary. She recalls the rest of the song, thus teaching Ninten the eighth and final melody in the process, and reminisces about an alien named Giygas that she loved as her own child. Queen Mary reveals that she is George's wife, Maria, and vanishes. Magicant, revealed to be a mirage created by her consciousness, vanishes with her. The party is warped back to the top of Holy Loly Mountain. Large rocks block the entrance to a cave inside Holy Loly Mountain, but are cleared by the power of Maria's consciousness. In that cave, they find an area with human prisoners including Ana's mother. They need to defeat the Mother Ship to free the prisoners. The party encounters the ship and a fluid-filled tank that contains Giygas. The alien expresses its gratefulness to Ninten's family for raising it, but explains that George stole vital information from its people that could have been used to betray them, and proceeds to accuse Ninten of interfering with their plans. Giygas offers to save Ninten alone if he boards the Mother Ship, only for Ninten to decline, leading Giygas to attack him in an attempt to put him to sleep. The party begins to sing the Eight Melodies while Giygas tries to quiet the party through his attacks. However, the party persists and finishes the lullaby, causing Giygas to become overwhelmed with emotion at the thought of Maria's motherly love. Giygas swears that they will meet again and flies off in the mother ship. The game ends with Ninten, Ana, and Lloyd facing the player as the credits roll behind them.  Development  Mother was developed by Ape and published by Nintendo. While visiting Nintendo for other work, copywriter Shigesato Itoi pitched his idea for a role-playing game set in contemporary times to the company's Shigeru Miyamoto. He thought the setting would be unique for its incongruence with role-playing genre norms, as daily life lacked the pretense for magic powers and they could not simply give the child characters firearms as weapons. Itoi's project proposal suggested how the natural limitations could be circumvented. Miyamoto met with him and praised the idea, though he was not sure whether Itoi \\"could pull it off\\". As an advertiser, Itoi was used to concept proposals preceding the staffing process, but Miyamoto explained that video game concepts needed people who signed on to \\"make\\" the product. Itoi was overcome with \\"powerlessness\\". Miyamoto was also hesitant to work with Itoi at a time when companies were pushing major celebrity product endorsements, as Itoi's involvement would be for such a game. When the two met next, Miyamoto brought the documentation from a text adventure game and told Itoi that he would have to write similar documentation himself. Miyamoto said that he knew from his own experience that the game would only be as good as the effort Itoi invested, and that he knew Itoi could not invest the appropriate time with his full-time job. Itoi restated his interest and reduced his workload, so Miyamoto assembled a development team. Upon assessing for compatibility, they began production in Ichikawa, Chiba. Itoi had said earlier that he wanted his work environment to feel like an extracurricular club consisting of volunteers and working out of an apartment, which Miyamoto tried to accommodate. Itoi wrote the game's script and commuted from Tokyo, a process he found \\"exhausting\\". Even with asking Itoi to prioritize the development process, Miyamoto received criticism of acquiescing to celebrity and of hiring a copywriter not up for the task. Miyamoto said that his decision to pursue the project was based on his confidence in Itoi. According to Itoi in a 1989 Famitsu interview, the word \\"mothership\\" was the influence for the game's title, although he states the title had other meanings too.https://twitter.com/johntv/status/1132552371790213121/photo/1 Mother was released in Japan on July 27, 1989 for the Famicom (known as the Nintendo Entertainment System outside Japan).  Localization and release  The game was originally scheduled for localization into the English language for a North American release as Earth Bound, but despite the localization work being fully completed and scheduled for release, the project was abruptly cancelled in 1991 due to the game's size and scope making a cartridge release too impractical, as well as due to the impending release of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in North America. The game's localization was a significant undertaking for Nintendo of America, not only for the sheer amount of text that needed to be translated but also necessitating the censorship and adjustment of a large amount of imagery and dialogue to conform with Nintendo of America's policies against gore, drug use, and religious or sexual content. In addition, Nintendo of America's team took the liberties of revising the layout of certain areas to reduce their difficulty, adding a run button (which in actuality simply doubles the game's speed on the overworld), several new features to the in-game menus (i.e. commands that allow the player to examine items and enemies), changing the game's map feature from an item to a Start button command, renaming certain characters and areas to appeal more to American audiences, altering the story so that Ninten and co. learn the eighth melody from George's grave on Holy Loly Mountain (though still retaining the scene where the party is warped to Queen Mary), and altering the ending to explain the fates of the main characters. In this new ending, it is explained that the captured adults are freed from the cave and reunited with their children, and the group parts ways. Lloyd is given a hero's welcome back at his school, Teddy fully recovers, reforms himself, and becomes a performer at the karaoke bar where he was first met, and Ana receives a letter from Ninten, who returns home to his family and takes a much-needed rest. This ending also features a roll call of most of the cast (which would become standard for the Mother series), a new credits sequence, and a post-credits scene where Ninten's father attempts to call him and alert him of something important, acting as a sequel hook. Before its ultimate cancellation in the west, the game was set to be released with an 80-page strategy guide and a separate release of the soundtrack (similarly to the Japanese release) and even received small amounts of advertisement via previews in gaming magazines such as Nintendo Power. While the finished product never saw an official overseas release as originally intended, it was significant in that it was able to motivate Nintendo to start developing their games with international audiences in mind, sometimes going out of their way to make adjustments to their games prior to localization to make the latter process easier. According to Phil Sandhop, the director of Mother's localization, in an interview with LostLevels.org, \\"the Mother project and localizing it really opened up a few eyes at Nintendo. They began working closer with Nintendo of America and the other subsidiaries to produce artwork for games that would be appropriately received anywhere in the world and not need localization.\\" In 1998, a version of the completed, original Mother localization was found. The cartridge was auctioned and the ROM uploaded to the Internet, where it unofficially became known as EarthBound Zero in order to more easily differentiate it from its similarly-titled 1994 sequel. Roughly 26 years after its original Japanese launch, on June 14, 2015, moments prior to the Nintendo World Championships, the publisher hosted a video message from Shigesato Itoi in which he announced that the English version of Mother will be officially released for the first time on the Wii U‚Äôs Virtual Console service, now under the title EarthBound Beginnings. The title was made available for digital download from the Wii U eShop in North America and Europe later that day, the same day as the protagonist from the third entry, Lucas from Mother 3, was released as downloadable content for Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.  Music  The game's soundtrack was composed by Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka. Tanaka was a video game composer working for Nintendo who had previously composed for games such as Super Mario Land and Metroid, while Suzuki was a composer and musician for bands of many different genres. The NES was only able to play three notes at a time, which Suzuki has noted greatly limited what he was able to produce, as he could not create some of the sounds he wanted. An eleven-track album of songs inspired by the game's soundtrack was recorded in Tokyo, London, and Bath and released by CBS/Sony Records on August 21, 1989. The album contained mostly vocal arrangements in English and was likened by RPGFan reviewer Patrick Gann to compositions by the Beatles and for children's television shows. He found the lyrics \\"cheesy and trite\\" but appreciated the \\"simple statements\\" in \\"Eight Melodies\\" and the \\"quirky and wonderful\\" \\"Magicant\\". Only the last song on the album is in chiptune. Gann ultimately recommended the 2004 remastered release over this version. The game's soundtrack contains several tracks later used in subsequent series games.  Reception and legacy  Mother received a \\"Silver Hall of Fame\\" score of 31/40 from Japanese reviewer Weekly Famitsu. Reviewers noted the game's similarities with the Dragon Quest series and its simultaneous \\"parody\\" of the genre's tropes. They thought the game's sequel, EarthBound, to be very similar and a better implementation of Mother gameplay ideas. Critics also disliked the game's high difficulty level and balance issues. Mother sold 150,000 copies. Jeremy Parish of USgamer described the game as a mild-mannered parody (\\"between satire and pastiche\\") of the role-playing game genre, specifically the Dragon Quest series. He noted that Mother, like many Japanese role-playing games, emulated the Dragon Quest style: the windowed interface, first-person perspective in combat, and graphics, but differed in its contemporary setting and non-fantasy story. Parish commented that Atlus's 1987 Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei was similarly set in the modern day, though it devolved into science fiction and fantasy in ways Mother did not. He added that the game has \\"a sense of wonder and magic realism ... in the context of childhood imagination\\", as Ninten can feel more like someone \\"pretending\\" to be a Dragon Quest-style hero than a hero in his own right. Parish said this makes the player wonder which game events are real and which are Ninten's imagination. Parish cited Itoi's interest in entering the games industry to make a \\"satirical\\" role-playing game as proof of the genre's swift five-year rise to widespread popularity in Japan. Cassandra Ramos of RPGamer praised the game's graphics and music, and considered it among the console's best, with \\"rich, ... nicely detailed\\" visuals, Peanuts-style characters, and \\"simple but effective\\" audio. In contrast, she found the battle sequences aesthetically \\"pretty bland\\" and, otherwise, the game's \\"least interesting\\" aspect. Overall, she found Mother \\"surprisingly complex ... for its time\\", and considered its story superior to (but less \\"wacky\\" than) its sequel. She especially recommended the game for EarthBound fans. Parish credited Itoi for the game's vision and compared his ability and literary interests with American author Garrison Keillor. Parish felt that Itoi's pedigree as a writer and copywriter was well suited for the space-limited, 8-bit role-playing game medium, which privileged Mother ahead of other games written by non-writers. USgamer Parish noted how the game's non-player characters would \\"contemplate the profound and trivial\\" instead of reciting the active plot. He added that the game's lack of an official North American release has bolstered the reputation and revere of its immediate sequel. While Parish said Mother script was \\"as sharp as EarthBound\\", he felt that the original's game mechanics did not meet the same level of quality. Mother lacked the \\"rolling HP counter\\" and non-random encounters for which later entries in the series were known. Parish also found the game's balance to be uneven, as the statistical character attributes and level of difficulty scaled incorrectly with the game's progression. Rose Colored Gaming, a company that made custom reproductions of the NES cartridge, noted that the Japanese release's was more challenging than the unreleased English localization. RPGamer Ramos similarly found balance issues, with a high number of battles, difficult enemies, reliance on grinding, and some oversized levels. Parish wrote earlier for 1UP.com that in comparison to EarthBound, Mother is \\"worse in just about every way\\", a clone where its sequel was \\"a satirical deconstruction of RPGs\\". He wrote that the game's historical significance is not for its actual game but for the interest it generated in video game emulation and the preservation of unreleased games. Mother was rereleased in Japan as the single-cartridge Mother 1+2 for the Game Boy Advance in 2003. This version uses the extended ending of the unreleased English prototype, but is only presented in Japanese. Starmen.net hosted a Mother 25th Anniversary Fanfest in 2014 with a livestream of the game and plans for a remixed soundtrack. Later that year, fans released a 25th Anniversary Edition ROM hack that updated the game's graphics, script, and gameplay balance. In April 2016, a film group known as 54&O; Productions announced a Kickstarter campaign to secure funds for a fan-made documentary entitled Mother to Earth. The documentary will focus on the road to Mother's localization in North America, and will include interviews with key people behind the process. After the success of the Kickstarter campaign, the documentary was initially set to be released around December 2018, but was later delayed to Q2 2019.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X00vOi5FAQ  Notes and references =NotesReferences= External links  * Category:1989 video games Category:Game Boy Advance games Category:Mother (video game series) Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Nintendo games Category:Pax Softnica games Category:Role-playing games introduced in 1989 Category:Role-playing video games Category:Video games scored by Hirokazu Tanaka Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games produced by Shigeru Miyamoto Category:Video games set in the 1980s Category:Virtual Console games Category:Virtual Console games for Wii U ","title":"Mother (video game)"},{"id":"3556758","text":"Dang Bireley's and Young Gangsters (Thai: 2499 ‡∏≠‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ò‡∏û‡∏≤‡∏•‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏á or 2499 Antapan Krong Muang; literally: 2499 Gangsters Rule the City) is a 1997 crime drama film about young Thai gangsters in 1950s Thailand. Featuring John Woo- style heroic bloodshed, it was the debut film from director Nonzee Nimibutr and was the first screenplay by director and screenwriter Wisit Sasanatieng. The 2499 in the Thai title refers to the year in the Buddhist calendar when the story starts, corresponding to the Gregorian year 1956. Plot Dang, the son of a prostitute, growing up in 1950s Thailand, compensates for his inferiority complex by boosting up his ego. At the age of 13, he killed a man who was beating his mother. By age 16, he had dropped out of school and started his own protection racket. With his right-hand man Lam Sing, Dang is highly protective of Piak, and is also friends with Pu Bottle Bomb and Pu's sidekick Dum. Dang attracts the attention of a young night club singer named Wallapa, who pressures Dang to stop being a gangster and live a normal life. Dang's mother also wishes that he would stop being gangster and ordain as a Buddhist monk. Dang carves out more territory by killing the local crime boss Mad Dog. Meanwhile, Piak is caught up in a fight between rival school gangs, instigated by Pu and Dum. The fight leads to a falling out between Dang and Pu the beginning of a feud between the two. Following a military coup all the gangsters must leave Bangkok for the countryside, Dang, Lam Sing and Piak go to work for Sergeant Chien, a former policeman turned gangster, at Chien's bar and gambling den next to an American military base. Chien needs more muscle to go against a rival operator, Headman Tek, and brings in Pu and Dum against Dang's wishes. Pu and Dum stir up trouble in the gambling den and reignite their feud with Dang's gang although Sergeant Chein tries to calm them. However Sergeant Chien is killed by a motorcyclist gunman and Pu and Dum go to work with his rival Headman Tek forcing Dang's gang out of the town. Dang returns to Bangkok, where he plans on fulfilling his mother's wishes and taking his oath as a monk. However Pu and Dum show up during the ceremony and gun battle ensues. Lam Sing is killed, and Dang and Piak are wounded, but Pu and Dum are killed. In an epilogue, narrated by an older Piak, it turns out Dang survived his wounds, but continued as a gangster seemingly unable to become a monk, and then died in a car accident at age 24, just like his idol James Dean.

Because it is different from other Thai films in the same era, due to it was made realistically and met international standards. It has been recognized as a film that truly opens a new era for the Thai film industry.

The Kerala-Tamil Nadu border check post is situated here, and is marked by an arch. It is 26 km from Palakkad on the NH 544, 27km from the Coimbatore Railway station and 37km from the Coimbatore International Airport. Location Walayar is a small developing town, located in the Palakkad district of Kerala, India. It is situated in the border between the states of Kerala and Coimbatore city in Tamil Nadu on NH 47 where the Commercial Tax (previously sales tax) Check Post, motor vehicles check post, and excise check posts are located. Due to the high traffic on this route (most of the goods import into Kerala happens through road and predominantly through this road), the place was notorious for the traffic jams. But now the condition has changed with the improvement of National Highway 47 from Walayar to Vadakkanchery. Now the NH is four lane with service roads and other facilities. There is exclusive service road for goods vehicles from the entry point of the check post to the exit point so that passenger vehicles can easily pass through the check post area without any interruption. Widening of NH 47 completed on 2015. Most of the passenger vehicles coming from other states, viz buses, tourist cabs, pilgrims enter Kerala through this gateway. Walayar is considered as the Gateway of Kerala from Mainland india , as other border checkposts are located in ghat section and huge entry like walayar .Also Walayar have railway entry point to Kerala . Due to its location in Tamilnadu border (State with lottery ban) walayar is famous for Kerala Lottery outlets.Many tamils comes to walayar to buy Kerala State Lottery.Similary Toddy is also banned in Tamilnadu and tamils comes to walayar to get Tender desi toddy Walayar has a railway station which is about 100 meters away from NH 47. Walayar came to limelight of late due to the presence of the Sales Tax Check post (supposed to be the most corrupted before and one of the 10 biggest check posts in India). Checkposts There is a misunderstanding that there is only one check post in Walayar. Actually there are five check posts of different Departments of Kerala Government in Walayar as detailed below: #Commercial Tax Check Post-Commercial Tax Department, Kerala #Motor Vehicle Check Post-Motor Vehicle Department, Kerala #Excise Check Post-State Excise Department, Kerala #Forest Check Post-Kerala Forest &Wild; Life Department, Kerala #Rinder Pest Check Post -Animal Husbandry Department, Kerala As far as the entire check posts of all departments are concerned Commercial Taxes check Post stands first in terms of number of officials and in terms of Revenue to the state because it has nearly 200 officials where as all other check post have less than 40 officials. Commercial Taxes comprises 76% of the State Exchequer. Walayar is also famous for lottery shops which are located in abundance here. Exporting timber also is a major occupation. Deer Park There is also a Deer Park located beside the NH 47 which presently now in a poor condition due to lack of facilitation. The Park spread over 110 acres of forest area mainly of Teak plantation started in 1997 got recognition from the Zoo Authority recently with conditions to convert it as a Safari Park providing more amenities for the Deer and other animals and also to the visitors. The Park located 22 km from Palakkad town could be developed as a tourist centre as one can see Deers and other small animals roam about in their natural habitat. This Deer park is also refereed as Jayaprakash Narayan Smrithivanam. Since Walayar is a gateway it is also the main entry point to the main tourists centres of the District like Malampuzha, Kanjirapuzha, Nelliampathy, Silent Valley, Mangalam Dam etc. Industries Malabar Cements Ltd, a Public Sector Undertakings owned by Kerala Government which produces grey cement is one of the landmarks of Walayar. Transportation This town connects to other parts of India through Palakkad city. National Highway No.544 connects to Coimbatore and Bangalore. Other parts of Kerala is accessed through National Highway No.66 going through Thrissur. Coimbatore International Airport is the nearest airport which is about 43 km away.

Initially released in Japan and North America in late 2005, the game was later made available in Europe and the PAL region in early 2006. It is the first strategy-based installment of the series, using tactical, grid-based combat instead of the turn-based battles employed by previous games in the series. The game's music was composed by series veteran Norikazu Miura and features the opening theme \\"Another World\\" performed by Japanese vocalist yoshiko. The game's fantasy story is told in two parts, taking place both before and after the events of Suikoden IV released one year earlier, and features appearances by characters from the title. Players assume the role of Kyril, a young man investigating the power of mysterious weapons called \\"Rune Cannons,\\" which hold strange powers of transformation. Gameplay A battle sequence Suikoden Tactics is a tactical role-playing game and thus shares many traits with the genre. The player controls a young man named Kyril, and advances the plot by completing tactical battles and talking with other characters. The player can also recruit new characters to his cause, which often involves a short sidequest. In towns, the player can gather information, sharpen character's weaponry, learn new skills, and buy equipment. Each character may use special \\"Runes\\" or items to imbue terrain squares with various elements. Characters each have a particular element on which their attack and defence is boosted by a significant amount when they occupy a space with the corresponding element, and the reverse is true if the character occupies a space with an element the character is weak to. Another feature of the battle system in Suikoden Tactics is its use of supporting characters. Such characters have no offensive value, as they can not attack, but impart various effects on the playing field such as healing, stealing, digging, and stat buffing. Aside from that, the elemental runes and weapon runes from previous games return. Elemental Runes all have as their level 1 spell, a magic that turns an area of the playing field of a certain element. Weapon runes in Suikoden Tactics operate differently from previous Suikoden games. Instead of a single attack with infinite uses, weapon runes impart three different attacks that operate similarly to spell runes, as each attack is defined by a certain number of charges before it can no longer be used, although all MP would be recharged upon a level-up. Story The story of Suikoden Tactics begins about seven years before the events of Suikoden IV, and establishes the reason why Kyril is determined to search out and destroy the Rune Cannons. The prequel part of Suikoden Tactics ends with a traumatic event for Kyril, and how Brandeau gains the possession of the Rune of Punishment. The game leaps forward about three years after the events of Suikoden IV takes place. From here on, Kyril begins his investigation on Rune Cannons and eventually leads him north into the Kooluk Empire. Kyril meets a mysterious man, Iskas, who hints at a connection between Rune Cannons and Kooluk. From there, Kyril investigates further about connections between Kooluk and Rune Cannons, and soon leads Kyril to Kika and her pirate crew. Clues turn Kyril's journey north, first to the fortress of El Eal, then finally into the Kooluk Empire itself. During his investigation in the Kooluk Empire, Kyril and his company meets up with a young aristocrat girl named Corselia, who is later revealed as the granddaughter of the Emperor of the Kooluk Empire. It is also here that Iskas finally reveals his real intentions and begins a plot to antagonize Kyril. Soundtrack The music for Suikoden Tactics was composed and arranged by Norikazu Miura, who would go on to also compose the soundtrack of Suikoden V. The opening theme \\"Another World\\" was performed by yoshiko. The music was released first as the Rhapsodia Privilege Collection was released on September 22, 2005. It is a single CD containing selected tracks from the game as well as remixes from other Suikoden soundtracks. It also features a preview of \\"Castle of Dawn,\\" the music for the Ceras Lake castle in Suikoden V, which was at the time unpublished. A week later on September 28, the Rhapsodia Original Soundtrack was released as a full compilation of the music in the game over 2 CDs. Reception Suikoden Tactics was met with a fairly positive response in Japan, selling approximately 64,472 within its first year, enough to qualify it for a re- release under Sony's \\"PlayStation the Best\\" distinction in November 2006 at a budget price. Famitsu gave it a score of two eights, one seven, and one eight for a total of 31 out of 40. The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. GameSpot praised the game's user- friendliness and battle design, stating that the game was \\"fun for veterans and newcomers alike\\", yet found the game's \\"weak story and characters\\" and \\"spotty voice acting\\" to be its low points. IGN also found the game's battle system to be engaging, but ultimately declared the game's plot to be \\"paltry\\", urging the player to \\"[e]xpect more from battles rather than plotlines.\\" Conversely, Game Informer found the game too confusing with haphazard battle scenes, stating, \\"I'd rather have a simple and well-balanced game than a complicated and lopsided one, and Suikoden Tactics definitely has too many short legs.\\" Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine stated that the gameplay \\"works when it's not broken\\", but was hindered by \\"boring\\" story sequences and \\"awful\\" graphics. Eurogamer found the game to be lackluster when compared to other tactical-based role-playing games, particularly those developed by Nippon Ichi Software, declaring that Suikoden Tacticss \\"[b]attles are fun and fairly compulsive but this is a game we've played many times over, usually presented better, executed more beautifully and intertwined with a far superior story.\\" G4's X-Play echoed their sentiment, stating that \\"despite some interesting play mechanics, it's not nearly as deep as some of the other games on the market right now.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Official Japanese website * Official European website Category:Role-playing video games Category:Suikoden Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation 2-only games Category:Tactical role-playing video games Category:Video game prequels Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games with cel-shaded animation Category:2005 video games ","title":"Suikoden Tactics"},{"id":"3556770","text":"The Solothurn S18-1000 20 mm was a Swiss anti-tank rifle used during the Second World War. It was a variant of the earlier S-18/100 with modifications for a higher muzzle velocity, as well as a larger cartridge size. The more powerful ammunition resulted in significant recoil, which was problematic for the gunner, and its size made portability difficult. History 20mm Tankb√ºchse 40 Solo S18-1000 20 mm Solothurn Tankb√ºchse S18-1100, AA-mount The Solothurn firearms company was owned by the German firm Rheinmetall, who used the Swiss company to manufacture arms which were prohibited for manufacture by any German firm under arms limitations imposed at the end of the First World War. In 1940‚Äì1941 the US Army considered adopting the Solothurn S18-1000. The weapon was standardized for limited procurement as 20mm automatic gun T3. In spring 1941 the Solothurn was tested against the Colt .90-cal. (23mm) T4 automatic gun, an aircraft gun. Although not as powerful, the Solothurn was less bulky and complicated and was found more suitable for army use. The plans were to acquire 50 pieces, and later to produce the weapon in the US. However, long contract negotiations resulted in abandonment of the purchase.Zaloga, Delf ‚Äì US Anti-tank Artillery 1941‚Äì45, p 7.

On 28 November 1829, Success revisited Western Australia and ran aground on Carnac Reef, a shoal further to the south, causing extensive damage. Description The sandbank extends about from the coast in a west and north-west direction, and is up to wide. It covers an area of . Two approximately man-made shipping channels, built for the Fremantle Port Authority to carry cargo and other deep water ships to and from Gage Roads through to Cockburn Sound, divide the sandbar.

It had a semi-automatic action in a bullpup configuration. As a result of its large, powerful ammunition, the gun had a tremendous recoil, and its size made portability difficult. The feed was either from a five or (more usually) ten-round magazine that was attached horizontally to the left side of the gun. The gun used 20√ó105mm belted-case ammunition which it shared with the S 18-350 aircraft cannon that was developed from the rifle. A Finnish source gives armour penetration of the gun (probably achieved with the Hungarian APHE-T round, since it was the only type used in Finland) as 20mm at a 60-degree angle at 100-metre distance, decreasing to 16mm at 500 metres. A variant of this design, the Solothurn- Arsenal, was manufactured without license in Estonia before WW2; however only 20 were produced prior to Soviet occupation. In March 1940, with funds collected in Switzerland to help the Finnish war effort in the Winter War, Finland bought twelve S 18-154 anti-tank rifles from Solothurn, though the purchaser was nominally the Swiss army. The weapons arrived into Finland during the spring after the war had ended, but they were later used in the Continuation War. However, the guns were soon found to be obsolete in their intended role. Various models of the S-18 series, including the Solothurn S-18/1000 and the Solothurn S-18/1100 were also used by Switzerland, the Kingdom of Hungary, Nazi Germany, the Kingdom of Italy, Kingdom of Romania, and the Netherlands. The Solothurn firearms company was owned by the German firm Rheinmetall, and used the Swiss company to manufacture arms which were prohibited for manufacture by any German firm, to get around arms limitations imposed upon them at the end of the First World War.

Hamilton made the Top 10 in the United Kingdom with \\"We Will Make Love\\", but in the United States, it was the B-side, \\"Rainbow\\", which made the Top 10. Biography Born as Ronald Hulme in Everton, Liverpool, Lancashire, he was one of the first singer-songwriters of pop music to have come out of the city, and he was the first Liverpool artist to hit the United States music scene with his song \\"Rainbow\\", several years before the Beatles. In 1957, chart success in the U.S. was very unusual for a British performer, and Hamilton commuted from one side of the Atlantic to the other to meet the demands for live performances. A former Redcoat, Hamilton's first hit in the United Kingdom was \\"We Will Make Love\\", which he recorded in 1957 for Oriole Records. However, in the U.S., it was the B-side, \\"Rainbow\\", that became the hit; according to Hamilton himself, it was mistakenly thought to be the A-side of the single. This produced the possibly unique event of a single reaching the Top 10 in the UK, while its flipside achieved the same result across the Atlantic. \\"We Will Make Love\\" peaked at No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart, and \\"Rainbow\\" reached No. 4 on Billboard's Hot 100. The record sold over one million copies, and reached gold disc status. Hamilton followed this success later that same year with another self-penned item, \\"Wedding Ring\\", which reached the Top 20 in the UK. In 1960, he was invited to Nashville, Tennessee and signed up with MGM Records. In Nashville, he recorded \\"Gonna Find Me a Bluebird\\" with the Jordanaires and Chet Atkins. His success with record releases did not improve, and by the early 1960s he had dropped away from the foreground of the pop music scene. He has written many songs which were popular, especially in Asia. \\"Little One\\", a song he wrote for his niece in Canada, was his personal favourite. Other songs such as \\"I Still Belong to You\\", \\"I Had a Dream\\" and \\"Reprieve of Tom Dooley\\" were quite popular. He performed the song \\"I Had A Dream\\" on the television show Six-Five Special. However, this hit has subsequently received little airplay. Hamilton died on 11 October 2008, at the age of 76, at his home in Buckley, North Wales.

The Parable of the Lost Sheep is one of the parables of Jesus. It appears in the Gospels of Matthew () and Luke (). It is about a shepherd who leaves his flock of ninety-nine sheep in order to find the one which is lost. It is the first member of a trilogy about redemption that Jesus tells after the Pharisees and religious leaders accuse him of welcoming and eating with \\"sinners.\\"Richard N. Longenecker, The Challenge of Jesus' Parables, Eerdmans, 2000, , pp. 201‚Äì204. The two parables that follow (in Luke's Gospel) are those of the Lost Coin and the Prodigal Son. The parable of the Good shepherd, a pericope found in John 10:1‚Äì21, derives from it Matthew.  Narrative  In the Gospel of Luke, the parable is as follows: Interpretation Depiction of the Good Shepherd by Jean-Baptiste de Champaigne showing the influence of this parable. The parable shares themes of loss, searching, and rejoicing with the Parable of the Lost Coin. The lost sheep or coin represents a lost human being. As in the analogy of the Good Shepherd, Jesus is the shepherd, thus identifying himself with the image of God as a shepherd searching for stray sheep in Ezekiel . Joel B. Green writes that \\"these parables are fundamentally about God, ... their aim is to lay bare the nature of the divine response to the recovery of the lost.\\"Joel B. Green, The Gospel of Luke, Eerdmans, 1997, , p. 526. The rejoicing of the shepherd with his friends represents God rejoicing with the angels. The image of God rejoicing at the recovery of lost sinners contrasts with the criticism of the religious leaders which prompted the parable. Depiction in art The image from this parable of the shepherd placing the lost sheep on his shoulders () has been widely incorporated into depictions of the Good Shepherd.Walter Lowrie, Art in the Early Church, Pantheon Books, 1947, , p. 69. Consequently, this parable appears in art mostly as an influence on depictions of the Good Shepherd rather than as a distinct subject on its own. Hymns While there are innumerable references to the Good Shepherd image in Christian hymns, specific references to this parable can be recognized by a mention of the ninety-nine other sheep. Perhaps the best-known hymn describing this parable is \\"The Ninety and Nine\\" by Elizabeth C. Clephane (1868), which begins: > There were ninety and nine that safely lay In the shelter of the fold. But > one was out on the hills away, Far off from the gates of gold. Away on the > mountains wild and bare. Away from the tender Shepherd's care. Away from the > tender Shepherd's care.The Cyber Hymnal: The Ninety and Nine.

History  As a result of the defeat of the central-powers during World War I and the subsequent Treaty of Versailles, Germany was forbidden from developing arms. In order to circumvent these limitations many German arms firms opened foreign subsidiaries or bought controlling interests to continue designing and selling arms. One of these companies was the Swiss Solothurn company which was owned by the German firm Rheinmetall.  Design  The S-18/1100 started life as a selective fire variant of the earlier S-18/1000 anti-tank rifle. As a result of its powerful ammunition, the gun had tremendous recoil. Also, its length and weight made portability difficult, so a two-wheeled split-trail carriage was provided. Once towed into position the gun could be fired from the carriage or dismounted and fired from a bipod for the anti-tank role. In the anti-tank role, it was able to penetrate at (30¬∞). In addition to its anti-tank role it was offered with a collapsible high-angle mount with three outriggers so it could function as a light anti-aircraft gun.  Service  In addition to being used by the Swiss, it also saw service with Hungary as the Tankbuchse, Italy as the Fucile anticarro, Germany as the 2 cm PzB785(s) and The Netherlands as the Geweer tp 18-1100.

The associations are overseen by the international Order of St John and its priories (national branches). The first such organisation to be founded was the St John Ambulance Association, which was founded in 1877 in England.The Difference ‚Äì newsletter from St John Ambulance, (Nov 2014) p4 \\"A Brief History of St John Ambulance\\" Its first uniformed first-aiders were founded in 1887 as the St John Ambulance Brigade.M Durrant (1948) American Journal of Nursing 48 (12) pp763‚Äì765 \\"St. John Ambulance Brigade\\" These two have since been merged into a single association. St John Ambulance now have over 40 national organisations, many of which are affiliated with Johanniter International, and over 500,000 volunteers worldwide. The Order of St John owns the brand name. Logos may vary in each country but always contain the eight-pointed white Maltese cross as the essential identifier. Like the Order, St John Ambulance associations accept members of all religions. Their geographic organisation differs from the Order, and they have to contend with the differing national laws, medical practices and cultures of countries. As a result, the role and organisation of St John Ambulance varies by country.  Organisation  The legal status of each organisation varies by country, province, state, county, territory and municipality. In both England and Wales the resident St John Ambulance organisations are simultaneously but separately registered as charities and companies, whereas St John Ambulance South Africa (for example) is a distinct entity registered as a \\"public benefit organisation\\". The presence of St John Ambulance is different among countries: St John Ambulance were traditionally organised with military-style ranks. Some associations have replaced these with civilian titles (e.g. Unit Manager, Superintendent). Johanniter International In the aftermath of World War II, British soldiers established Saint John brigades in Germany. In cooperation with the Johanniter Orden (the Protestant German Order of Saint John), the Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe was founded in 1952. In recent years, more national Saint John societies, not directly linked to the British St John Ambulance, have been founded in Europe, notably in Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Poland. At the international meeting of the governing bodies of the Orders of Saint John in the course of celebrations to mark the Order's 900th anniversary in 1999, the idea to cooperate more intensively within Europe was born. As a result, Johanniter International (JOIN) today links sixteen national Saint John organisations all over Europe. Relationship with the Order Logo of the Order of St John. The Order of Saint John, formally the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem is an international order of chivalry which is headquartered in the United Kingdom. The Order founded the St John Ambulance associations and oversees their work. They also own the rights to the St John name and brand, including the Maltese Cross logo. The Order also oversee the St John Eye Hospital Group, which is separate to the ambulance associations. Most members of St John Ambulance are not themselves members of the Order, and vice versa, so a major presence of the Order does not dictate a major presence of St John Ambulance.

This was copied from British police telephone boxes, from the 1970s and earlier, the larger versions on which the TARDIS is modelled contained a folding canvas stretcher and a first aid kit provided by St John Ambulance. These boxes pre-dated universal radio communication and enabled both patrolling police officers to contact their station and members of the public to call for assistance. If a call came in for the officers the blue light on the roof would flash. The St John logo also appears on the windows of a hut dedicated to first aid at a Church Fair shown in an episode of Jeeves and Wooster.

The median household income was $37,500. History The Mullan Military Road, started in 1859 by Lieutenant John Mullan, connected the upper navigable Missouri River with the Columbia River. This 624-mile road, which passed through what was later to become the town of Benge, was completed in 1862 at a cost of $280,000. The Benge section of the road was completed on May 22, 1861; the wagon ruts were still visible in 2008 just northeast of town at the site of the First Benge School. Although built as a military road, it was used by civilians for both travelers and cargo transport until the Northern Pacific Railroad was completed in 1883.The Mullan Road The town is named after Frank H. Benge, who represented Adams County in the State Legislature in 1904. Benge and his wife donated the land upon which the town site was platted on May 13, 1907. Frank & Mary Crouch Benge and daughters came to Adams County in 1892. They had lived on the current site of Benge for 15 years when the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway surveyed the rail line to pass right through their ranch house. The Benges were paid $5,000 to move their house. They built an 11-room house with the rock excavated from a nearby rail cut. The house became a boarding house and served as a community center for a number of years.The Adams County History Link  References  Category:Unincorporated communities in Adams County, Washington Category:Unincorporated communities in Washington (state) ","title":"Benge, Washington"},{"id":"3556820","text":"Chowringhee Road (also spelt Chourangi Road), located in the Chowringhee neighbourhood of Kolkata, is the arterial road running from the eastern fringes of Esplanade southwards up to the crossing with Lower Circular Road (AJC Bose Road), in the city of Kolkata, West Bengal, India. It is the single most important road of the metropolis of Kolkata. It was officially renamed as Jawaharlal Nehru Road after Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister, but the original name Chowringhee Road is used commonly. History Arguably one of the first roads in the city, prior to the coming of the British, the road used to link the villages of Kalighat and Chowringhee. The village of Chowringhee was named after the hoary saint Chowranginath of the Nath sect of mystical Hinduism who had his 'dera' or camp over there, and the name stuck on in spite of the British rule and was changed after the independence of India during the rule of the Congress regime. After the British started expanding their settlement outside the Fort area in the mid-18th century, the area around Chowringhee was one of the first expansions. And the same area remained their pride and commercial centre until their departure in 1947. During the early British developments around the Chowringhee area, they built huge bungalows and houses all along the eastern end of the road, thus earning Kolkata the sobriquet - 'City of Palaces'. It was a prosperous era of Kolkata, which came to be the second city of the British empire. Rows of huge palatial houses flanked by gardens and the area along the western edge of the road was a huge open area called the Maidan. The Maidan was intentionally kept open and development-free due to security purposes of Fort William. Later there were tanks made on the western stretch of the road at each important crossing right from the Lower Circular Road junction (now the Exide crossing) to the Esplanade near Curzon Park. Of these only a couple exist now - the Manohar Das Tarag and the one at the junction of Park Street and Chowringhee. Of the reclaimed tanks, one was where the Calcutta Information Centre and the Maidan Police Station now stand, another one where the Maidan metro station now stands and still a third on where the Esplanade bus-terminus now stand. The beauty of the road no longer exists and can only be seen in drawings and sketches of the bygone era. With the advent of trams, tram-tracks were laid along the western edge of Chowringhee to connect the southern areas of Tollygunge and Ballygunge to Esplanade. These tracks, also, no longer exist due to trams' slow speed and the advent of metro rail. Of the grand palaces and mansions of the era, only a few still remain - \\"the Oberoi Grand Hotel\\", the \\"Janbazar\\" Building (which was owned by Rani Rashmoni) at the junction of Corporation Street (now S.N. Banerjee Road), \\"The Chowringhee Mansions\\" (now housing several offices) at Kyd Street intersection, the \\"Asiatic Society\\" at the Park Street crossing and the majestic \\"Indian Museum\\" are the well known ones. Some buildings from a later period include the \\"Kanak Building\\" (now housing offices of Citibank and Standered Chartered Bank) at the junction of Middleton Street, \\"Virginia House\\" (housing the headquarters of ITC) and the New Market Watch Tower building. The building at the Lindsay Street intersection, which used to house the famous Italian joint Firpo's, was razed in a blaze in 2002. Chowringhee still remains very much the heart of Kolkata and the place of choice for many large business houses. This saying of old must have been followed by each architect who designed the newer buildings on Chowringhee, showcasing their extravagant self. Examples include the Tata Centre at the intersection of Harrington Street (now Ho Chi Minh Sarani), Jeevan Sudha (at the Middleton Street intersection), Everest House (next to Tata Center), J K Centre, SAIL Building, The Reliance House, the Metro Railway Building, among others. Chatterjee International Center is the tallest building situated on this road. It rises up to a height from the ground and comprises 24 floors. Places of interest Chowringhee Road is not only the commercial heart of the city, but also the cultural heart. The Indian Museum and the Government Art College are located here, along with the afore- mentioned The Asiatic Society. The Bishop's House, housing the residence of the Bishop of Kolkata and the St. Paul's Cathedral, is located here. The M. P. Birla Planetarium is on the junction of Chowringhee Road and Cathedral road and the Victoria Memorial (on Queens Way) is a stone's throw away from here. The neo-cultural centres of Rabindra Sadan, Nandan and the Academy of Fine Arts are next to Chowringhee on Lower Circular Road and the Cathedral Road. The Tipu Sultan Mosque is at the intersection of Chowringhee Road, Chittaranjan Avenue and Lenin Sarani (formerly Dharmotollah Street). The huge expanse of the Maidan is busy throughout the year with fairs and political meetings. Proposed Skyscraper A tall residential skyscraper (65 floors), named The 42 is being built at 42B Jawaharlal Nehru Road between Tata Centre and Jeevan Sudha. Once completed, it will become the tallest building in India outside Mumbai.
