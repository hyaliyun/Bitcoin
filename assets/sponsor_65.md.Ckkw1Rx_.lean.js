Stems (with Rubus fruticosus foliage intertwined) It is a deciduous shrub or small tree growing to 8‚Äì10 m (rarely 20 m) tall, often multi-stemmed, with trunks up to 30 cm (rarely 50 cm) diameter and grey bark; the crown is dense, broad ovoid, with numerous erect branches. The leaves are glossy dark green above, and densely hairy with white hairs beneath, 6‚Äì10 cm long and 3‚Äì5 cm broad, broadest near the middle, shallowly lobed with seven to twelve forward- pointing lobes on each side of the leaf, bluntly pointed at the apex, and serrated margins. The autumn colour is dull grey-brown. The flowers are 10 mm diameter, with five white petals and 20 yellowish-white stamens; they are produced in corymbs 5‚Äì10 cm diameter in late spring. The fruit is a globose pome 10‚Äì12 mm diameter, bright red, maturing in mid autumn. The fruit is dryish, and eaten by thrushes and waxwings, which disperse the seeds.Hansen, K. F. (1985).

It is also closely related to Sorbus intermedia (Swedish whitebeam), which differs in having the leaves grey-white below and more deeply lobed, with the lobes spreading rather than forward-pointing, the fruit oval and less bright red, and in forming a stouter tree with a single trunk and more horizontal branching.

One of the main beliefs of this church was that the use of the fictional drug Somec was evil. Shortly after Garol‚Äôs great grandfather died the small church broke up. Garol then went to school and as he grew older he decided that God did not exist. Eventually he became a brilliant scientist and was put into suspended animation using Somec to extend his life. When he was a young man he discovered that the church was right and that the use of Somec was wrong because most of the people who were on it did nothing to deserve to have their lives extended. As a result, Garol joined a group of revolutionaries that claimed it wanted to take over the government so that it could reform the rules for Somec use. Later, he realized that the people in the group had no real interest in reform but only wanted to guarantee their own supply of the drug.

While he was still a little boy he discovered that he could hear the thoughts of everyone around him except his uncle. Although he was unable to read his uncle's thoughts Peter could sometimes feel hatred coming from Elijah. As a result he started to hate and fear his uncle. One day when Peter stumbles on a wasp‚Äôs nest and gets stung he discovers that he can kill the wasps with his mind. That night he tries to kill his uncle using the same power, but discovers that his uncle is more powerful than he is. Elijah hurts Peter to teach him a lesson and then tells him to never use his power again. At first Peter stops using the power because he is afraid of his uncle but as he grows older and becomes a man he restrains himself out of love and respect for Elijah. Connection to the Worthing Saga This story takes place several years after the events in the story \\"Worthing Farm\\". Orson Scott Card wrote a very different version of this story in chapter 10 of his novel The Worthing Chronicle. In the previous version, Elijah has two children: one of them, Adam, is the one child with telepathic powers, while Elijah's innkeeper brother, Mathew, has the gift to shut his mind to telepathy. One night, while Adam tortured the citizens of the small town of Worthing, Elijah tried to stop his son and Adam attacked him. Mathew eventually saves Elijah from his own son, who flees to another city, where he begins a political career using his gift to manipulate and blackmail others.

Courtesy of A.KR√úSS OptronicA photoelectric flame photometer is a device used in inorganic chemical analysis to determine the concentration of certain metal ions, among them sodium, potassium, lithium, and calcium. Group 1 and Group 2 metals are quite sensitive to Flame Photometry due to their low excitation energies. Analysis of samples by Flame photometer In principle, it is a controlled flame test with the intensity of the flame color quantified by photoelectric circuitry. The intensity of the colour will depend on the energy that had been absorbed by the atoms that was sufficient to vaporise them. The sample is introduced to the flame at a constant rate. Filters select which colours the photometer detects and exclude the influence of other ions. Before use, the device requires calibration with a series of standard solutions of the ion to be tested. Flame photometry is crude but cheap compared to flame emission spectroscopy or ICP-AES, where the emitted light is analysed with a monochromator. Its status is similar to that of the colorimeter (which uses filters) compared to the spectrophotometer (which uses a monochromator).

In addition, a number of primary schools in West Yorkshire bear her name. Biography Ledston Hall, Elizabeth's home, now a listed building Elizabeth was born in April 1682, to Theophilus Hastings, 7th Earl of Huntingdon (1650‚Äì1701) and his first wife Elizabeth Lewis, co-heiress of Sir John Lewis, a wealthy merchant who owned Ledston Hall, in West Yorkshire. Of nine children from this marriage, only Elizabeth and her brother George, later 8th Earl of Huntingdon (1677‚Äì1705) survived into adulthood. Two years after Elizabeth Lewis died in 1688, Huntingdon married Mary Fowler (1664‚Äì1723), the wealthy widow of Thomas Needham, 6th Viscount Kilmorey (1659‚Äì1687). They had two sons and four daughters; Ann (1691‚Äì1755), Catherine (1692‚Äì1739), Frances (1693‚Äì1750), Theophilus, 9th Earl of Huntingdon (1696‚Äì1746), Margaret (1699‚Äì1768) and Ferdinando (1699‚Äì1726). Her father quarrelled with George over the Ledston estate, leading to a legal dispute only resolved in 1703, two years after his death in May 1701. Once this was settled, Elizabeth received Ledston Hall and ¬£3,000 per year; when George died suddenly in February 1705, she also inherited his share of their grandfather's estate. An attractive, young and extremely wealthy lady of reputed wit and warmth, she received several marriage proposals but her correspondence indicates remaining single was a conscious choice. George's titles passed to his half-brother Theophilus; Elizabeth paid for his memorial in St James' Church, Piccadilly, which can still be found in the east gallery, south side. He left an illegitimate son named Henry, who was brought up by Elizabeth and is thought to be the Henry Hastings who was treasurer of the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge from 1745 to 1747. She supervised the education of her siblings and her four half-sisters lived at Ledston Park for many years. In 1726, she arranged Theophilus's marriage to Selina Hastings (1707‚Äì1791), a key figure in the early Methodist movement and founder of the evangelical sect known as the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion. Career Joseph Smith (1670-1756), Provost of The Queen's College, Oxford Her father was closely associated with James II, who destroyed his support base when his religious policies seemed to go beyond tolerance for Catholicism and become an assault on the Church of England. As one of the few to support these policies until the very end, Huntingdon's reputation suffered from being seen as an active persecutor of his own church. Late in life, Elizabeth recorded memories of attending her mother's deathbed in London in December 1688, with widespread panic and rioting in the streets outside over fears of a Catholic invasion. Exclusion from political life meant women like Elizabeth often found an outlet in religion and education, viewed as fitting their 'role' as nurturers and providers of moral guidance. She adopted her father's High Church, Tory beliefs, although she was not a supporter of the exiled Stuarts. Many of her clerical contacts were Nonjurors, those who refused to swear allegiance to William III after the 1688 Glorious Revolution; the vast majority simply felt bound by their oath to James and the issue went away when he died in 1701. They included Joseph Smith, who became Provost of The Queen's College, Oxford and later persuaded her to fund scholarships at the college. Smith was part of a network that combined Tory, High Church beliefs with support for the post-1688 settlement, and was well-known for converting Catholic members of the English aristocracy to Anglicanism. In 1715, he advised Elizabeth to take the Oath of Abjuration, denying the right of James Francis Edward Stuart to the throne. He also provided guidance when she became interested in Methodism; this began as a reform movement within the Church of England and accusations of Jacobitism derived from its rejection of existing structures, rather than support for the Stuarts. Her friend and distant relative Catherine Stanhope married William Wogan (1678-1758), an evangelical on close terms with Methodist leaders John Wesley and George Whitefield. When Catherine died in 1726, her seven year old daughter went to live at Ledston Hall. Elizabeth's distant relative, poet and playwright William Congreve Although women were not officially permitted to become members, she was closely connected to the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge; this brought her into contact with wealthy philanthropist and Non-Juror Robert Nelson (1656‚Äì1715), whose works were apparently read as homilies at Ledston. Together with Lady Catherine Jones, in 1709 she funded a girls' school in Chelsea, supported by the Society. It is thought to be the first in England that had an all-women Board of Governors. The school and its curriculum was run by Mary Astell (1666‚Äì1731), an educationalist sometimes called the first English feminist. Astell was the daughter of a wealthy, upper-class merchant, who shared Elizabeth's Non-Juror connections and political beliefs. She is now best known for her essay 'Some reflections on marriage', in particular her question \\"If all Men are born free, how is it that all Women are born Slaves?\\" Elizabeth was distantly related to poet and playwright William Congreve; he referenced her in the Tatler journal, as did Richard Steele, who wrote \\"...to know her is an immediate check to loose behaviour, and to love her a liberal education.\\" Both referred to her as Aspasia; it is not clear why, since the Greek original was reputedly a high-class courtesan, but her connections clearly extended beyond religious philanthropy. Selina, Countess of Huntingdon (1707‚Äì1791) Unlike her more combative sister-in-law Selina, she was known for her warm nature and as a generous host, despite being personally abstemious. The gardens at Ledston were laid out by Charles Bridgeman, who designed those at St James's and Hyde Parks; she was considered an innovative landlord, encouraging the use of irrigation techniques and fertilisers by her tenants. She owned one of the first personal accounts with Hoare's Bank, which was used for her business dealings, including investments in the early stock market. This was designed to produce cash, since landed wealth was relatively illiquid, and allowed her far greater flexibility in terms of donations. Several primary schools in West Yorkshire still bear her name, including Ledston, Collingham, and Thorp Arch. In 1721, she made a significant donation towards construction of Holy Trinity Church, Leeds, as well as contributing ideas to its design. Early in 1738, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy, performed without anaesthetic, but her health continued to decline. Needing to survive another 12 months to comply with the laws on establishing a trust, she died at the end of 1739, one year and one week later. She was buried in All Saints Ledston, a church dating back to the 7th century. Ledston and its library were left to her nephew Francis, much to the disappointment of Lady Selina, whose own charitable works were rapidly exceeding her resources. Scholarships at Queen's College for northern students were funded by her Wheldale estate, site of Wheldale Colliery from 1868 to 1988. The remainder established the 'Lady Elizabeth Hastings Charities', focusing on education, primarily in the North of England; they still exist and in the decade since 2008, awarded grants totalling more than ¬£2.2 million.

Bernds. It is part of a series of exploitation films about juvenile delinquents produced during the 1950s by American International Pictures. American International Pictures released the film as a double feature with Hot Rod Gang. Plot summary Joyce Martin is a transfer student at her new school. On her first day, she is sized up by the leader of the Hellcats, Connie. For her first test of initiation, Joyce is tricked into wearing slacks to school even though it is verboten by school policy. During class the teacher asks Joyce to be the blackboard volunteer, Joyce reluctantly gets up, and Miss Davis asks her why she is wearing slacks. Humiliated, she cuts class and goes to a nearby coffee shop and meets the coffee shop employee Mike, a college student who takes night classes, as he must financially support himself. Joyce goes to a Hellcats meeting at an abandoned theater where she is officially introduced to the members of the Hellcats. Connie explains to her the premise of the group: the Hellcats are a girl gang who rule the social order of the school. If she is invited to join, she will be popular; if she fails, her life will be very rough. Joyce has passed the first test but must undergo two more before initiation. Good grades aren't allowed and she may only date Hellcat-approved boys. Joyce agrees but she secretly begins dating Mike. The girls meet to go shoplifting the next day. When they stop at the coffee shop afterward, Joyce is rude to Mike. Connie and Dolly tell her she should stay away from him. The next initiation test requires Joyce to go up to Riff, who is with his girlfriend, and ask him to be her date at a dance. To the furor of his girlfriend, he agrees. At the party, they decide to play a game of Sardines. In the dark, a scream is heard. When the lights come on, they find Connie's body on the downstairs landing. She is dead. They agree to get out quickly and not say anything. A couple of boys drop Joyce off near her house. Mike drives by and she jumps into his car. The boys come over and try to beat Mike up but he is able to fend them off. Joyce and Mike go to his apartment. Joyce cries on his shoulder, says it was a terrible party, and eventually falls asleep in his arms. Joyce's father is furious when she finally arrives home. Her mother defends her. Joyce says she will not follow her father's rules. Connie is reported missing and the police start questioning students at the high school. Dolly, now running the Hellcats, reminds them to say nothing. Joyce visits sympathetic teacher Miss Davis, but does not tell her anything. Dolly leaves a note on Joyce's desk summoning her to a meeting that night. Mike gives her a ride to the abandoned theater. She tells him she will only be 10 minutes, just time enough to quit the Hellcats, and he waits outside for her. Two of the Hellcats find the note and go to Miss Davis. They know that there is no meeting and they are worried that Dolly intends to teach Joyce a lesson. Miss Davis calls the police. On the balcony of the theater Dolly confronts Joyce, telling her that she pushed Connie out of jealousy because she was getting too friendly with Joyce. Dolly lunges toward Joyce with a knife but Joyce moves at the last moment and Dolly falls over the balcony to the floor below, dead. The police arrive. Mike rushes in. Miss Davis arrives. Mike takes Joyce home. Miss Davis calls Joyce's parents to tell them what happened. She tells them that Mike is a good guy. Joyce's parents are waiting on the doorstep. They hug Joyce. Joyce's father pats Mike on the shoulder and they enter the house together.

Mary Pickford put up $100,000 for each of the movies. Grofe Jr. had his name removed from the credits, fearing the low-brow nature of this and Hot Rod Gang would reflect poorly on his father. Location The film was shot on Comstock Avenue in Holmby Hills, with Holmby Park in the background.Karie Bible, Marc Wanamaker, Harry Medved, Location Filming in Los Angeles, Arcadia Publishing, 2010, p. 88 Reception In October 1958, at an American International Pictures luncheon for the Theaters Owners Association of America, producer Jerry Wald said that the pictures like High School Hellcats are \\"not the type of picture on which we can build the market of the future. While they may make a few dollars today, they will destroy us tomorrow.\\" Producer James H.

Players compete to acquire six small books for their bookshelf. They do this by partly by answering multiple-choice questions, partly by visiting special spaces on the board: The Bookshop, The Book Corner, The Library and also by chance events triggered by the turn of an Award or Sentence card. Each player takes turns moving round the board until one player has acquired six books: one of each of six categories. Once the player has a book shelf with six books they head for the centre space and if they arrive with book shelf intact they win. The board game was first launched and played at The Hay Festival of Literature in 2007. Equipment Each player is represented by a small coloured bookshelf. This is moved around the board according to the roll of two dice. Each bookshelf can accommodate up to six small books. Each book is colour-coded to represent a category of books: Sci-fi and Fantasy, Crime and Thrillers, Poetry and Plays, Children and Fun, Travel and Adventure, Classics and Modern. Items in the standard edition are: * The board * 6 different coloured bookshelves * 36 books - six of each category colour * A set of small labels (or Dust jackets) - optional for use on the small books * 1200 multiple-choice question cards * 42 Award & Sentence cards * 2 dice * Rules Official Rules Each Player selects a Bookchase Shelf as their playing token and places it near the board centre. For example, the Yellow Shelf is placed on the Travel Adventure space (Yellow) near the centre, the Light Blue Shelf on Crime & Thrillers space (Light Blue) etc. The Bookchase Shelf is used to collect one of each of the six coloured books representing the different categories of Bookchase. Each Player rolls the dice and the highest scorer starts play. If two or more Players tie they roll again until the highest scorer is clear. Play runs clockwise. Each Player rolls in turn. First Player rolls the dice moving this number of spaces in any direction they choose. The idea is to visit each section of the board and claim a book by landing on a Bookchase Runner and answering a multiple-choice question correctly. A Player's turn must always use the exact number rolled. A Player may change direction at the start of each turn and at intersections or ‚Äòdead-ends‚Äô but no backtracking is allowed. As soon as a Player has a Bookchase Shelf with six books, one from each Category they must race for the centre space of the board. An exact number must be thrown to land on this space. Players need to be careful at this stage to avoid hazards. Variations in play Depending on type, age and skill level of players a number of variations of play are possible. The game is designed to allow player customisation and the creation of house rules. Known variations include: Kids, Dash, Expert, and Collector.

Erected in 1916, when the Socialist movement was strong in the city, it was active for only a few years until socialism fell out of favor amidst persecution of socialists and labor unionists including the Anaconda Road Massacre and the lynching of Frank Little. During its brief time of service, the Industrial Workers of the World met here, also holding meetings in Butte's Finlander Hall. Today a sporting goods shop occupies the first floor of the former Socialist Hall. The building is physically outside the boundaries of the Butte-Anaconda-Walkerville National Historic Landmark District, but is included with it for documentation. The Socialist Hall building is a two-story building which \\"is an excellent example of craftsmanship and design in a two-part commercial block style building.\\" It faces east onto Harrison Avenue with a chocolate colored and beige brick facade.

Since 2009, the museum has been part of the Senckenberg Gesellschaft f√ºr Naturforschung with headquarters in Frankfurt/Main. The main field of research is soil biology. In the years 2006 to 2017 the number of visitors was between 25,000 and 34,000, in the year of the 3rd Saxon State Exhibition 2011 it was even 47,000.  History  In 1811 the Ornithological Society of G√∂rlitz was founded on the initiative of the cloth merchant Johann Gottlieb Kretzschmar and the actuary Giese. The Ornithological Society zu G√∂rlitz was founded in 1823 as the Naturforschende Gesellschaft zu G√∂rlitz; it was re- established in 1990 as the Naturforschende Gesellschaft der Oberlausitz. In the years 1858 to 1860, the G√∂rlitz Society established its own museum on the centrally located Marienplatz on the former city moat area on the initiative of the physician and pharmacist W. J. Kleefeld and the Economic Commission Councillor Georg von M√∂llendorff. It was ceremoniously opened by M√∂llendorff on 26 October 1860. After the reconstruction of the museum building, President Walther Freise was able to reopen the collections in 1902. In 2008, the museum was accepted into the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz scientific community. Since 1 January 2009 it has belonged together with the Naturmuseum Senckenberg in Frankfurt am Main and the Senckenberg Natural History Collections Dresden to the network of the Senckenberg Nature Research Society.  Lead  Reinhard Peck was appointed the first museum director of the Naturforschenden Gesellschaft in 1885. After him the botanist Hugo von Rabenau became museum director. After Freise's death in 1921, the biology teacher Oskar Herr took over the museum's management as a part-time member due to a shortage of money. From 1959 to 1995 Wolfram Dunger managed the G√∂rlitz Natural History Museum. In 1995 he handed over the management of the museum to Willi Xylander.  Collection Holdings  In 1819 the first preparations of 181 native land and water birds, 50 exotic birds and a collection of nests and eggs formed the \\"cabinet\\" of the Ornithological Society. In 1827 the collection was extended by 150 North American bird species (by G.S. Oppelt, Fairfield, Canada). In 1837 the coin collection was stolen and in the same year the mineral cabinets were opened. In 1846, three spacious rooms were rented per year for 50 Thalers on the first floor of Petersstra√üe 3 to house the collection. In the same year, visitors could marvel at the collections on two mornings of the week. To protect the collections from unauthorised persons, a padlock was attached to the \\"Kabineths-Th√ºre\\" in 1850. In 1858 the Society for Nature Research received a collection of African plants from Johann Christian Breutel from Herrnhut (an important cryptogamist). In the following year the collection of the entomologist and botanist August Kelch from Ratibor was bought for 200 thalers. In 1860 the pharmacist Reinhard Peck was appointed curator (first museum director in 1885). During his tenure, the collections experienced a significant upswing. The ornithologist and president of the Society Julius von Zittwitz was committed to the expansion of the collections and prepared 1500 birds for the Society himself. Museum director Hugo von Rabenau acquired the Central Asian herbarium of Sintenis and the extensive Schwarzsche K√§f collection. In 1914, the museum received a gorilla from Cameroon as a gift from Hans Sch√§fer, a member of the society. In the same year, Bruno Hecker's egg collection (with 1400 eggs from 363 Central European bird species) was donated to the society. The bird collection of Robert von Loebenstein, one of the most important private bird collections in Upper Lusatia, was also donated to the Society in 1930. However, it no longer found a place in the premises of the museum and was therefore housed in the former Vogtshof (at St. Peter's Church). As of 2014, the collections contain around 6.5 million insects, mites, millipedes, snails, mussels, vertebrates (including 30,000 skulls), plants (around 375,000 specimens), mushrooms and thousands of minerals, rocks and fossils. The objects in the collection are the subject of scientific research by more than 40 museum researchers. The museum has a special scientific library with approximately 151,000 media units (mainly documents from the fields of zoology, soil zoology, botany, ecology, geology and palaeontology). In addition to specialist literature for the research work of scientists, it also offers generally understandable literature from the fields of natural sciences and the history of the region and can be used by the public.  Permanent Collections  The museum displays its exhibits on 1200 m¬≤ of exhibition space: * Dioramas designed close to nature show specially prepared habitats of Upper Lusatia with their typical plants and animals (wolf, sea eagle) - from the pine heaths in the north to the Zittau mountains in the south. * The geology exhibition shows the eventful history of the region: volcanoes, beaches and coal forests. But the Ice Age also shaped the landscape, as the finds of Mammut and Auerochse prove. * The edaphone of the soil is shown on a 30-fold enlarged column of soil. * In the rainforest and savannah exhibitions, large and small, well-known and unknown inhabitants are presented: from the beak to the finger animal, from the harpy to the ostrich, from the gorilla to the tiger. * A vivarium with 70 living animal species from the rainforests and native regions in 12 elaborately designed landscape basins on an area of 100 m¬≤ completes the other permanent exhibitions. Visitors are offered regular show feedings. Rarities such as the black freshwater stingray from Brazil, Madagascan tomato frogs or the Senegal flounderfish, a \\"living fossil\\", can be seen. But also native species like grass snake or the eurasian harvest mouse are represented. In addition, the museum offers play areas, multimedia, interactive learning opportunities and video films. Audio guides in German, English and Polish are available free of charge at the box office. The exhibitions are accessible to disabled visitors. Guided tours, children's events and birthdays can be obtained from the museum's educational department. = Special Exhibitions = Two special exhibitions each extend the museum's programm. The last special exhibitions were: * T. rex & Other Cool Heads - Form and Function of the Skulls (from 8 September 2018) * The Art of Botanical Painting - Watercolours by Tetiana Laskarevska (18 August to 18 November 2018) * Tricture 3D - Your journey to prehistoric times! (from 20 January to 12 August 2018) * Since 2011, a temporary exhibition in the entrance hall has provided information about the 200-year history of the Naturforschenden Gesellschaft der Oberlausitz and the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde in G√∂rlitz. * Mechanical animal world (from 13 May 2017 to 15 October 2017) = Travelling Exhibitions = In recent years, the museum has developed about a dozen international travelling exhibitions and thus presented its own research internationally. These include * The Thin Skin of the Earth - Our Soils (Chamber of Life: Soil Animals and their Biology, Chamber of Crumbs: Soil Types - Their Composition and Use, Chamber of Knowledge: Soils, Soil Biodiversity and Man, Chamber of Secrets: Endangering Soils) * Via Regia - Street of Species (exhibition shows the role of different animal and plant species as commodities, food, hunting goods, exotic attractions and stowaways on the old Via Regia) * Wolves (using the example of the Lusatian wolves to provide scientifically sound information on the biology and ecology of wild wolves) * In the Land of Grasses and Wild Horses - Biological Research in Mongolia * Float. Live. - Animated drops of water (shows in an oversized drop of water film footage of various \\"floating creatures\\" and large photos of plankton and large-format reproductions from \\"Art Forms of Nature\\" by Ernst Haeckel on banners) * Photo exhibitions: Life under Water 2012, 2014 and 2016 * Schwerelos - The World in Water: Photographs by Armin and Birgit Trutnau * Photo exhibition: Giantischklein (scanning electron microscopic animal photographs from the scientific work of the museum) * Out Of Focus: Nature Photographs by Axel Gebauer In 2018 where more than ten travelling exhibitions on tour from G√∂rlitz.

He wanted to create an organization that would protect families following the death of a breadwinner. During a Sunday sermon, Root heard the pastor tell a parable about pioneer woodmen clearing away forests to build homes, communities and security for their families. He adopted the term \\"woodmen\\" for his organization. To complete the name, he added \\"modern\\" to reflect the need to stay current and change with the times, and \\"of America\\" to symbolize patriotism. Originally, Modern Woodmen had a unique set of membership restrictions and criteria. Religiously, the group was quite open, accepting \\"Jew and Gentile, the Catholic and Protestant, the agnostic and the atheist.\\" However, until the mid-1900s, membership was restricted to white males between the ages of 18-45 from the 12 \\"healthiest\\" states -- Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, the Dakotas, Nebraska and Kansas. Residents of large cities were also disqualified from membership, as were those employed in certain professions, such as railway workers, underground miners, gunpowder factory employees, liquor wholesalers and manufacturers, saloon keepers, \\"aeronauts\\", sailors on the lakes and seas, and professional baseball players.Alan Axelrod International Encyclopedia of Secret Societies and Fraternal Orders New York; Facts on File, inc 1997 pp.264 In 1884, the head office was organized in Fulton, Illinois. The first death claim of $698.58 was paid the same year.\\"Beetle, Ax and Wedge\\", Time Magazine, 21 June 1937, . = Foresters drill teams = One of the most unique elements of the organization was its drill teams, which came to be known as the Modern Woodmen Foresters. The first drill team was organized in Hutchinson, Kansas, in 1894. These groups became nationally known for events held from 1890 to the late 1930s, and the Foresters were even honored by Herbert Hoover at the White House. Because each group was differentiated by a different style and color of uniform, their demonstrations were referred to as \\"Rainbow Parades.\\" The Rainbow Parades were hosted by cities across the United States and included 10,000 units of Foresters, with more than 160,000 men participating. The last known Rainbow Parade was held on Michigan Boulevard in Chicago, and it halted traffic for more than two hours while thousands of spectators viewed the scene. = Modern Woodmen Sanatorium = During the tuberculosis (TB) epidemic of the early 1900s, Modern Woodmen opened a 1,000-acre (4.0 km2) facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 1907. The facility cost $1.5 million to build and was named one of the most outstanding institutions for the treatment of tuberculosis by the American College of Surgeons, From 1909 to 1947, the sanatorium provided free treatment to more than 12,000 members. It offered board, lodging, treatment, medicine, dental work and laundering, all at no expense to the patient. Tuberculosis was the leading cause of death among Modern Woodmen members when the society opened the Modern Woodmen Tuberculosis Sanatorium. Following World War II, antibiotics became available and TB declined in the United States. The facility closed in 1947, when TB ranked eighth in leading causes of death. = Home offices = Modern Woodmen's first home office was organized in Fulton, Illinois, in 1884. When the organization moved to Rock Island, Illinois, in 1897, Fulton residents fought to keep Modern Woodmen in their town. The move was blocked three times before it was successful. In 1898, Modern Woodmen officially opened its home office at 1504 Third Ave. In 1967, Modern Woodmen opened a new home office, located at 1701 First Avenue in Rock Island, Illinois, to accommodate its rapid growth. Its home office remains there today, where the organization maintains an active role in the Quad Cities community. In 2008, Modern Woodmen became the naming rights sponsor of Modern Woodmen Park, home of the Quad Cities River Bandits, in Davenport, Iowa.  Fraternalism  Membership dues receipt circa 1923Modern Woodmen is a tax-exempt fraternal benefit society. The membership organization sells life insurance, annuity and investment products to help fund member benefits and social, educational and volunteer programs that meet community needs. As a fraternal organization, the society is organized around a lodge system, called chapters, Summit chapters and youth service clubs. These groups offer fellowship and community service opportunities for members. In 2016, Modern Woodmen members were part of 2,466 chapters, 283 Summit chapters and 782 youth service clubs nationwide. Modern Woodmen members across the United States participate in numerous activities to socialize, learn and volunteer in their communities. Members unite for volunteer efforts that provide money, donations, hand-on labor and other resources to improve lives in their communities. The organization's Matching Fund Program matches money raised by individual chapters for community members or local organizations in need. Modern Woodmen's fraternal expenditures for member benefits and community programs totaled $21.7 million in 2016. These programs included fraternal aid, college scholarships, newborn benefits, orphan benefits, final wishes resources, member discounts and youth educational programs.  Products  Modern Woodmen Bank in Rock Island Modern Woodmen and its subsidiaries provide life insurance and annuity, investment and banking products to the family market. Life insurance in force totaled over $38.9 billion in 2016.

For example, Silvan Tomkins (1962) concluded that there are eight basic emotions: surprise, interest, joy, rage, fear, disgust, shame, and anguish. More recently, Carroll Izard at the University of Delaware factor analytically delineated 12 discrete emotions labeled: Interest, Joy, Surprise, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, Contempt, Self-Hostility, Fear, Shame, Shyness, and Guilt (as measured via his Differential Emotions Scale or DES-IV). Discrete emotion theory states that these specific core emotions are biologically determined emotional responses whose expression and recognition is fundamentally the same for all individuals regardless of ethnic or cultural differences.  History The biological and physiological underpinnings of emotions were discussed by Aristotle in De Anima, by Charles Darwin in The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872), by William James (1884), and by John Dewey (1895). Tomkins' (1962, 1963) idea was influenced by Darwin's concept. He proposed that there is a limited number of pancultural basic emotions or \\"affect programs\\". His conclusion was that there are eight pancultural affect programs: surprise, interest, joy, rage, fear, disgust, shame, and anguish. John Watson believed that emotions could be described in physical states. Edwin Newman and colleagues believed emotions were a combination of one's experiences, physiology, and behaviour. Ross Buck came up with the facial feedback hypothesis, \\"that skeletal muscle feedback from facial expressions plays a causal role in regulating emotional experience and behaviour\\". After performing a series of cross-cultural studies, Paul Ekman and Carroll Izard reported that there are various similarities in the way people across the world produce and recognize the facial expressions of at least six emotions.  Evidence for the theory A study investigated whether the emotions behind specific facial expressions could be identified by people from a group in New Guinea who had had little to no exposure to Westerners and who had never seen a movie. The researchers showed the people pictures of people portraying six different emotions that are known as core emotions: happiness, anger, sadness, disgust, surprise and fear. Researchers found that the people of New Guinea could in fact point out the different emotions and distinguish between them. Various parts in the brain can trigger different emotions. For example, the amygdala is the locus of fear. The amygdala senses fear and it orchestrates physical actions and emotions. From this experiment, researchers concluded that these specific emotions are innate. They also looked at pictures of people ranging in age from infants to elders, and saw that the core emotions look the same, further supporting the discrete emotion hypothesis. Additionally, deaf and blind children show typical facial expressions for these same core emotions. Criticism James Russell and Lisa Barrett have criticized discrete emotion theory on several points. Those include problems in finding correspondences between discrete emotions and brain activity, variability in facial expressions and behavior, and gradations in emotional responses.

Established in the late 1980s, the circuit is highly regarded by motocross enthusiasts in the UK. Set in a valley, much of the circuit winds up and down the steep banks of the valley, with a number of large man-made jumps. The circuit is predominantly hard, chalky soil.  History  =Early History= After staging a number of national-level events in the early 1990s, the circuit was soon selected to stage Grand Prix events, regularly staging the British Motocross Grand Prix for the 125cc and 250cc classes. =Grand Prix Days= The circuit made history in 1995, when the first ever 'double-header' Grand Prix event was staged, with the 125cc and 250cc Grand Prix classes both being held on the same day. This proved a huge success with riders, organisers and fans, with the 'double-header' format now a standard feature of Grand Prix motocross. The day was especially notable for home fans as British rider Paul Malin took a popular home victory in the 125cc class. Belgian star Stefan Everts was a huge fan of the Foxhill circuit, as he took three Grand Prix wins at Foxhill in the 1990s, in 1995, 1996 and 1997. Everts, along with many riders, enjoyed the unique atmosphere at the circuit. With the circuit set in a valley, crowds of over 20,000 fans would perch on the hillsides, creating an exciting atmosphere more akin to a football stadium than a motorsports venue. Everts even claimed that as excited fans cheered and sounded air horns as the riders dropped into the valley on the opening lap, it was impossible to hear the engine on his bike! Grand Prix events were (and still are) often televised live on Eurosport, and at the start of each Grand Prix race a piece of music sampling the opening chords of Hells Bells by AC/DC was played on the TV and also at the circuit on powerful speaker systems. Such was the way that the music added to the occasion, Hells Bells is often seen by UK motocross fans as the de facto theme tune to the circuit. =Watershed and Decline= 1998 was to be watershed year in the history of Foxhill, as the circuit staged a Grand Prix event in May, along with the Motocross des Nations in September. The Grand Prix saw Everts de-throned as the 'King of Foxhill', when French rival Sebastien Tortelli snatched victory in the 250cc class. However, Everts was to reclaim his 'crown' at the Des Nations event in September. Torrential rain over the weekend turned the circuit into a mudbath, with conditions so bad that many of the world's leading riders, including a young Ricky Carmichael, were struggling like junior riders in the severe mud. So bad were the conditions that in the second race of the day, two-thirds of the elite riders got stuck on one of Foxhill's steep hills, dubbed by the media as 'Heartbreak Hill'. None of this was to bother Everts, who was a class apart as he took two race wins, helping the Belgian team onto victory. Whilst the Everts masterclass was to go down in motocross folklore, the real talking point was the terrible weather conditions. So bad were the conditions that it was reported that only the prestige and importance of the event meant that it went ahead. The mud caused problems with both riding teams and spectators becoming hopelessly stuck in the muddy fields after the event. After the Motocross Des Nations event, Foxhill was seemingly cursed by poor weather 1999 saw the Grand Prix once again return to Foxhill, with the circuit completely renovated and rebuilt. Saturday evening saw a severe thunderstorm, which once again turned Sunday's event into a mudbath. Such were the poor conditions that the eventual winner in the 250cc class was Dutchman Remy van Rees, a rider who previously had rarely broken into the world's top 15 prior to the event. Van Rees won by sheer consistency, as most of the world's elite struggled in the conditions. 2000 saw another first, as Foxhill was to stage a 'triple-header' with 125cc, 250cc and 500cc Grand Prix events all taking place on the same weekend, with the opening 125cc race on the Saturday. However, for the third year in a row, torrential rain ruined the event. Only the opening 125cc race took place, before Sunday's racing was cancelled due to safety fears. This was the final Grand Prix event to ever take place at Foxhill. With the circuit waterlogged for three years in a row, the circuit's poor infrastructure was a source of irritation to the Grand Prix promoters (at the time) 'Action Group', who were keen to raise the profile of Grand Prix motocross by moving to circuits with improved infrastructure. Thus the 2000 British Grand Prix was the final Grand Prix to be staged at Foxhill. =New Millennium= After 2000, the British Grand Prix was not staged until 2004. After three years of major events ruined by heavy rain, the Foxhill circuit was dilapidated and worn out. However, it would soon gain a new lease of life as an amateur circuit. Since 2000, a wide range of amateur events, including youth, adult and historic races have been staged at the circuit. Organising bodies have invested in the circuit, and in recent years the circuit and infrastructure have been totally renovated.

The former French Catholic diocese of Apt, in southeast France, existed from the fourth century until the French Revolution. By the Concordat of 1801, it was suppressed, and its territory was divided between the diocese of Digne and the diocese of Avignon. Its seat was at Apt Cathedral, in Vaucluse. History The Chapter of the Cathedral of Apt was founded on 4 August 991 by Bishop Teudericus, in consultation with Prince Guillaume of Provence, Archbishop Annone of Arles, Archbishop Amalric of Aix, and Bishop Ingilram of Cavaillon, out of the clerics who served the cathedral.Alban√®s, Gallia christiana novissima, p. 216. The original charter establishes a corporation composed of a Provost and twelve canons. By March 1247, dignities of the chapter are named in addition to the Provost: the Archdeacon, the Sacristan, the Precentor, and the Operarius.Saint-Marthe, Instrumenta. p. 80. In 1790 the National Constituent Assembly conceived a plan to destroy the influence of the Estates throughout France and bring the whole country under central administration. This was to be done by the creation of some 83 or 84 'd√©partements'. At the same time the Church was to be brought into subordination by abolishing the old ecclesiastical diocesan system and creating new dioceses which would have the same boundaries as the departments. The plan made more than fifty of the 135 Catholic dioceses in France redundant. The details were enacted by the Legislative Assembly, under the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790). The diocese of Apt was one of the dioceses which were declared redundant and were suppressed. The abolition of Catholic dioceses was a violation of Canon Law, and the requirement that the clergy were to be obliged to take an oath to the Constitution in order to hold their jobs and collect their state-supplied salaries brought about a schism. New bishops and priests under the Constitutional system were to be elected by special 'Electors' in each department, who did not need to be Catholics or even Christians. That too was uncanonical and schismatic. The vows of monks and nuns were abolished by the National Assembly, and their property was seized by the State. In 1801 First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte was preparing to end the religious confusion in France by entering into a Concordat with the Vatican. He had plans for the future, and he required a united France in order to carry them out successfully. In separate actions both he and Pius VII called on all bishops in France to submit their resignations. On November 29, 1801, by the bull Qui Christi Domini, Pope Pius VII suppressed all of the Roman Catholic dioceses in France, and immediately reinstituted them under papal authority. This act did away with whatever doubt or ambiguity might still exist as to a 'Constitutional Church' and 'Constitutional dioceses' in France. Apt was not one of the dioceses that was restored. The name of the diocese was revived, however, by Pope Benedict XVI in January 2009, as a titular see for bishops who have no diocese of their own.

The leaves are alternate, ovate to rhombic, long and broad, with a serrated margin and two to six pairs of veins, and a short petiole up to long. The flowers are wind-pollinated catkins long, the male catkins pendulous, the female catkins erect. The fruit is long and broad, composed of numerous tiny winged seeds packed between the catkin bracts.Plants of British Columbia: Betula occidentalisJepson Flora: Betula occidentalis The identity of similar birches in Alaska is disputed; some include them in B. occidentalis, while others regard them as hybrids between Betula neoalaskana and Betula glandulosa.

Plot summary John Tinker spends every winter at his cousin‚Äôs inn in the town of Worthing. While in town, John heals the townspeople with a special gift he inherited from Jason Worthing. On a particularly bad winter when the snow is very deep, John does his best to help the sick people of Worthing, but some of them die anyway. The residents blamed John for the deaths and kill some of the birds that he has also been taking care of. When John finds he was unable to help his nephew, people think he is refusing to help because of the dead birds and run him out of town. After he leaves, a very bad snowstorm hits Worthing, and more than half the people in town die. When the storm finally ends, John returns to Worthing and is beaten to death by the remaining townspeople.

Since 1994 the position has been elected by MLAs using a secret ballot. Previously, the Speaker had been appointed by motion of the house, in practice moved by the Premier of New Brunswick usually after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition. Shirley Dysart was the first Speaker to be elected by his or her peers. The Speaker is usually a member of the governing party. The only recent exceptions have been Robert McCready and Michael Malley. McCready was appointed by motion of Premier Richard Hatfield following the close election of 1978. Hatfield's Progressive Conservative Party had won only 30 seats compared to the 28 seats won by the opposition Liberal Party. McCready was a member of the Liberal caucus and was appointed over the objection of the Liberal Party. The Liberal opposition argued on a point of order before the clerk of the assembly that precedent required that the opposition support the motion appointing speaker, but the clerk allowed the motion to be put and carried by the government. Malley was elected in 2006 while sitting as an independent. Malley had left the government caucus following a cabinet shuffle that had seen the incumbent speaker, Bev Harrison, join the cabinet leaving the post vacant. Malley argued that he should have been included in the cabinet for regional reasons and left the government caucus in protest; to prevent losing control of the legislature in a tenuous minority government situation, the Progressive Conservative caucus supported Malley as speaker. Malley later changed his party affiliation, amid some controversy, back to that of the governing Progressive Conservatives while occupying the speakership.

It is one of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI)'s newest lifeboat stations and is also one of the first to cover a river rather than estuarial waters or the sea. Teddington Lock is the highest tidal point on the Thames. Establishment Following the collision in 1989 between the Marchioness and the dredger Bowbelle that resulted in the loss of 51 lives, the \\"Thames Safety Inquiry\\" recommended a centrally coordinated search and rescue presence on the Thames. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) was chosen to coordinate the services that already existed on the Thames. Since they already had operational duties, they approached the RNLI and asked if they could provide a rescue service. The RNLI recommended the creation of four lifeboat stations on the Thames to cover the tidal area between Teddington and the Channel. On 1 January 2002 Teddington lifeboat station became fully operational. It was thought that the lifeboat stations on the Thames would have to deal with approximately 50 call-outs per year. However, in the first year of operation there were over 800 call-outs. In fact the Thames lifeboat stations accounted for 10% of the total number of \\"shouts\\" that the RNLI responded to. Although Teddington is not the busiest Thames station it was quickly realised that its presence should extend further upstream to Molesey Lock, thereby including Kingston upon Thames within its operational area. In order to deal with this additional area, and to ensure operational effectiveness above and below Teddington Lock, Teddington is equipped with two \\"D Class\\" lifeboats and, unlike the other Thames stations, is run on a purely voluntary basis. Boats =D-477: Spirit of Nuneaton and Bedworth= Spirit of Nuneaton and Bedworth was Teddington RNLI's first ever lifeboat and was the first operational boat for the station. She entered service at Teddington at the station's inception, having been used as a training craft whilst the station was being set up during 2001. Once the station became operational, she was the station's only boat until the arrival of Spirit of the Thames. She left Teddington after the arrival of Spirit of Mortimer and returned to the reserve fleet. =D-576: Spirit of the Thames= This boat entered service at Teddington in June 2002. The boat was purchased from funds raised by Twickenham and Teddington fundraising branch. This boat was the last of the \\"old\\" style D class lifeboats to be built, before the introduction of the IB-1. She was officially named in June 2003. =D-648: Spirit of Mortimer= Spirit of Mortimer entered service at Teddington in May 2005, having made an appearance on the floor of the Barbican Arts Centre during the RNLI AGM. She was purchased from funds raised the Mortimer fund raising branch and was Teddington's first IB-1. She left Teddington on the arrival of the Peter Saw. =D-743: Olwen and Tom= Olwen and Tom entered service at Teddington in December 2010. She was a gift by Peter and Hilary Saw, in memory of the latter's parents, Gwladys Olwen Martin and Thomas Frederick Shelton. She was formally named on 21 May 2011 and is now the number two boat at the station, since the arrival of Peter Saw. = D-785: Peter Saw = Peter Saw entered service at Teddington in October 2015. She was a gift by Hilary Saw, in memory of her husband Peter Henry Saw. Since joining the station, she has been the main station boat and was formally named on 7 May 2016. Crew There are approximately 24 voluntary crew members, including engineers, bankers and designers, few members having any professional seafaring experience. They train every week in order to achieve the high standards of competence and safety expected of the RNLI. In the event of a call-out, every crew member‚Äôs pager is simultaneously activated by the London Coastguard. Twenty-four hours a day, 365 days of the year, the crew aim to launch one or both boats, depending on the nature of the incident, within six minutes of the call to the Coastguard. Their operational target is to be on scene within 15 minutes of the original call. This can be tight if the incident is in Molesey.

The simple plot ‚Äî composed of what are essentially episodes in the life of a pioneer family before the virgin hardwood forest was cut down ‚Äî is told in a third-person narration rich with folklore and suggestive of early backwoods speech. The central character is Sayward Luckett, the eldest daughter in a family who the narrator says \\"followed the woods as some families follow the sea.\\" The book was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1940. The Trees was followed by The Fields (1946) and The Town (1950). A single-volume trilogy was published in 1966. Plot summary Worth Luckett is a \\"woodsy\\" who provides for his family by hunting wild animals for food and trading their pelts for other commodities they need. When Worth notices that the wild game is leaving the woods near their settlement in Pennsylvania, he convinces his wife and family to move to where the animal population is more plentiful. They migrate into the Ohio Valley, in the fictional county of Shawanee, where they construct a log cabin. They are soon joined by other settlers, who form the beginnings of a community. The Lucketts suffer painful losses and hardships during their first few years in the Ohio Valley. Worth's wife, Jary, who was suffering from consumption during the journey, soon dies. The family survives disease, possibly typhoid fever. The youngest child, Sulie, becomes lost in the deep woods; unable to find her, the family gives her up as either dead or taken captive by the Lenape Indians. A grief-stricken Worth abandons his other children to search for her. The second daughter, Genny, marries a neighboring settler. Her husband later runs off with her younger sister, Achsa, causing Genny to suffer a temporary nervous breakdown. Throughout all of this, the oldest daughter, Sayward, holds the remaining family together. She assumes all responsibility for her younger siblings. Sayward marries a settler named Portius Wheeler, a lawyer known as \\"The Solitary.\\" He has migrated from Massachusetts, for unstated reasons. The marriage of Sayward and Portius ultimately appears to be successful. At the book's conclusion, the couple has begun to clear the land of trees surrounding the cabin, in order to plant crops. Portius has come out of his shell and begun practicing law again; and Sayward is expecting their first child. Writing style Richter conducted extensive research both for historical details and to convey the mode of speech of the early 19th-century pioneers of the Ohio Valley, many of whom originally emigrated from Pennsylvania and the Upper South. (For example, they referred to \\"trees\\" as \\"butts.\\") In order to write an authentic dialect to express this, Richter used rare collections of old manuscripts, letters, and records that documented the speech of early 18th- and 19th-century residents. His sources included Historical Collections of Ohio by Henry Howe and Pioneer Pennsylvania, a compilation of archaic Pennsylvanian slang by Henry W. Shoemaker. In addition, he interviewed scholars and former neighbors of pioneer heritage whom he had known in his home state of Pennsylvania and in the Ohio Valley.Esperson, Emma, \\"Biography of Conrad Richter\\", Pennsylvania Center for the Book, Pennsylvania State University, Fall 2011Richter, Conrad, The Awakening Land (1966), p. VII (Foreword) Richter wrote that this early form of spoken language no longer survived in the Ohio Valley. He learned that it was found in some areas of the South and Southwestern parts of the country. He noted that, although it is often mistaken for a \\"native\\" form of speech there, it should be considered \\"a living reminder of the great mother tongue of early America.\\" Richter, Conrad, The Awakening Land (1966), p. VII (Foreword) Major themes =Man vs. Nature= The characters in The Awakening Land deal with the human condition in a setting of great natural challenges as they carve out lives on the frontier. There was a high mortality rate due to disease, warfare, natural disasters, severe weather, and accidents, as well as dangerous animals. They worked to cut down trees and clear the land, to cultivate crops, to care for livestock, and to raise and process all their food. They also had to deal with hostilities from native Indians resisting European-American encroachment. At times they face famine, and natural disasters such as floods. =Family= Sayward values family above all else. She expresses a strong loyalty to the ties of kinship, even if this loyalty is not always returned. Several members of her birth family, such as her father Worth, her brother Wyitt, and her sister Ascha eventually abandon or otherwise leave the family home, with no attempt to maintain communication. Her younger sister, Sulie, is lost to the forest, and eventually becomes assimilated into the Lenape Indian tribe. But Sayward always remembers these absent family members and holds them in her thoughts. When Sayward has problems in her marriage or with her own children, whether due to her husband's infidelity or generational differences, she tries to defuse tensions and ultimately forgives any wrongs committed. =\\"Woodsies\\" vs. Settlement dwellers= Sayward distinguishes between \\"woodsies\\" like her father, Worth, and her brother, Wyitt (itinerant hunters who follow wild game wherever it is to be found), and people like her and her mother, who prefer to live in settlements near other people. > \\"She tried not to read her father's mind too hard, for she would hate to > think he had reasons of his own for wanting her married. A year and a half > was mighty long time, she knew, for one like Worth to be fixed and settled > in one place. . . If she had a man, it might change all that. He could go > off and forget to come home and they would be all right. Never would they > starve or go naked, for their married sister would take them in. He would be > free as a bird to wander. He could see those far places they told about > where the deer had strange black tails.\\" Richter, Conrad, The Awakening > Land, Chapter Seven of The Trees, p. 44 > \\"It was good enough, she felt, just to know they had humans closer around > them. . . They weren't set out any more in these woods only God Almighty > knew how far. . . You might say they were living in a settlement now. She > wished Jary could have hung on long enough to see it.\\" Richter, Conrad, The > Awakening Land, Chapter Eight of The Trees, p. 53 She attributes her father's preference for the \\"woodsy\\" life to his being part Delaware Indian (\\"Monsey\\", also spelled Munsee, in the dialect of this group).

Historical context Since the year 1000 and the Cluny renaissance, medieval society had evolved considerably. Europe had made great technical, artistic and demographic advances. Towns had developed, creating new social classes centred on the trades and commerce.L‚Äôenfance au Moyen-√Çge : la Ville. Site of the biblioth√®que Nationale de France Just as agricultural society had adapted to a feudal and religious system where nobility protected the lands and dispensed justice, so the new classes of craftsmen and merchants needed to be free to develop their business enterprises. With more and more matters of state to attend to, kings and their lords could no longer rule alone, and had to delegate part of their judicial powers to parliaments and other courts of justice. In England, the setbacks that John (considered as illegitimate and as usurping the throne from his brother Richard the Lionheart) faced against the Dauphin (heir apparent) led city-dwellers in 1215 to impose the Magna Carta on the king, a charter that instituted liberty for the cities and parliamentary checks on royal taxation. In France the Capetians held onto their power while favoring the development of strong cities as a counterbalance to strong (often over-strong) nobles. Starting with Philip IV, this was done by favouring the development of villes franches (towns granted special franchises), and by consulting with legislative assemblies known as States-General for making important decisions. In fact, the royal domain was considerably extended and most of the dukedoms progressively became appanages entrusted to the king's sons, avoiding the progressive division of the Capetians' possessions.http://www.cliohist.net. Les Communaut√©s rurales et urbaines : cliohist.net In France, the outset of the Hundred Years' War had been catastrophic and royal power was greatly contested after the defeat at Cr√©cy in 1346. In effect, Philip VI was enthroned to the detriment of Edward III thanks to a series of legal technicalities. In the same way, Charles II of Navarre (called \\"Charles the Bad\\") was a pretender to the throne, his mother Jeanne having been removed in order to avoid a powerful foreigner taking control of France by marriage. In this era the nobility justified the divine essence of its power by chivalrous conduct, especially on the battlefield. Thus, Cr√©cy was a disaster against a very numerically inferior army and Philip VI fled, calling into question the divine legitimacy of the Valois. This disrepute was worsened by the appearance of the Black Death in 1348, supporting the idea that this dynasty was not supported by God. Edward III and Charles of Navarre therefore saw their chance to emphasize their respective claims to the crown of France and attempted to win over the cities then losing hope in the institution of a controlled monarchy. his son Philip at the Battle of Poitiers remains famous and led to Philip's nickname the Bold. In 1356, at the Battle of Poitiers, King John the Good - not wanting to flee as his father had after Cr√©cy - fought heroically and was captured by the English, but acquired an enormous prestige. His son, and Dauphin, Charles, who was able to leave the battlefield, assumed the regency and attempted to negotiate with England. The grandes compagnies (demobilized mercenary soldiers) pillaged the countryside, and to counteract them the Dauphin suggested a permanent army of 30,000 men. To raise such an army, he had to raise taxes, and so he summoned the States-General.

The States-General declared the Dauphin the king's lieutenant and defender of the kingdom in his father's absence and assigned him a counsel of twenty men (twelve nobles, twelve bourgeois and four clerks) as foreseen by the order of 1355. √âtienne Marcel sought to reform the government and the administration of the kingdom.

The ordinance The text of this ordinance consisted of 61 articles. Less rigorous than that of December 1355, it sketched out a controlled monarchy and a vast plan of administrative reorganization. It specified that a purging commission of twenty-eight representatives, of which twelve would be bourgeois, would be put in charge of discharging faulty officials (particularly the collectors of particularly unpopular taxes). Guilty officials would then be condemned and their wills confiscated. The Dauphin renounced all impositions not voted on by the States-General and accepted the creation of a 36-strong counsel of guardianship that immediately started to put in place reforming measures. Six representatives of the States-General entered the king's counsel, which became the counsel of guardianship, to oversee the royal administration closely: finances and particularly the monetary changes and extraordinary subsidies were to be checked by the States-General. The ordinance also foresaw a fixed currency, no tax exemption for the nobility, the abolition of lords' right of requisition, and the taking of forage and horses sheltered from pillaging. In exchange for these measures the cities would furnish one soldier for every hundred homes. Five days after the ordinance was promulgated, almost all those who were royal counselors at that moment were exiled, the members of Parlement and of the Chamber of Accounts had their posts renewed, the officers of justice and of finances were discharged, and a court of appeal created.

The purging committee was set up but only functioned for 5 months. The tax collectors named by the States-General met with hostility from peasants and poor craftsmen. The six representatives on the guardianship counsel were in a minority and the States-General lacked the political experience to keep a permanent check on the Dauphin‚Äôs strength, as he took advice and rediscovered his officials' support. The frequent displacements, costly and dangerous in this era, discouraged the provinces' representatives, and the states became less and less representative. Little by little, only the Parisian middle class came to sit in the assemblies.Edward P. Cheney, The Dawn of a New Era 1250-1435 3√®me Chapitre: The Rise of the Middle Class: The Development of Representative Governmentgeocities.com But at last, the King, John the Good, keeping a good reputation and signing a two year truce with the prosecutors of the Prince of Wales, disavowed the Dauphin and, from his prison at Bordeaux, on 6 April 1357 banned the reforming ordinance from being applied. √âtienne Marcel and Robert le Coq protested to the Dauphin who, feeling confident in his support from the provinces (the provinces were not following the Parisian population's course of action), in the month of August forbade Marcel and his adherents from taking any part in government and announced that he would rule alone. Le Coq withdrew to his diocese; but Marcel remained at Paris, and took advantage of the Dauphin's departure (who had left to call the States-General together outside the capital) to organize resistance. From then on he planned to oppose the reigning branch of the Valois family, another part of the royal, and found in the person of the King of Navarre, Charles the Bad, already claiming the French throne. A \\"coup de main\\" arranged by Marcel enabled the King of Navarre to escape the castle of Ailleux where he was held, and the Dauphin returning to Paris without money, had to once again convene the States-General for 7 November; under pressure from the heads of the people, he granted his brother-in-law one safe conduct and authorization to return to Paris. On 13 January 1358, the States-General reassembled, but almost no nobles and very few churchmen attended. The representatives departed without having been able to come to an agreement on how to find subsidies. The following 23 January, the Dauphin prescribed an order authorizing the States- General to devalue the currency. √âtienne Marcel, noting the failure of his attempts to control the monarchy by legislation, proclaimed he would attempt to control it by force. It does not put back in cause the necessity to have a sovereign one, but it must compose with the one that will leave to him the more of strength. He did question the necessity of a sovereign, but it had to be composed with those who would most check his power. He oscillated between the supposed weakness of the Dauphin and the avarice of Charles the Bad.

Peru and Chile have shared diplomatic relations since at least the time of the Inca Empire in the 15th century. Under the Viceroyalty of Peru, Chile and Peru had connections using their modern names for the first time. Chile aided in the Peruvian War of Independence by providing troops and naval support. In the 19th century, as both countries became independent from Spain, Peru and Chile shared peaceful relations resulting from the formation of economic and political ties that further encouraged good relations. During the War of the Confederation (1836‚Äì1839), Chile and dissident Peruvians formed a military alliance to liberate and reunite the republics of South Peru and North Peru from the Peru- Bolivian Confederation. Later, during the Chincha Islands War (1864‚Äì1866), Peru and Chile led a united front against the Spanish fleet that occupied the Peruvian Chincha Islands and disrupted commerce in the South Pacific. In the 1870s, during the early conflicts prior to the War of the Pacific, Peru sought to negotiate a peaceful diplomatic solution between Bolivia and Chile. Although Peru had a secret defensive alliance with Bolivia, Peru did not declare war on Chile even after Chile invaded the Bolivian port of Antofagasta. War was not declared formally until Chile declared war on both Peru and Bolivia in 1879. Peru declared war on Chile the following day. The war resulted in a Chilean invasion of Peru and the destruction of various Peruvian buildings, cities, a major raid and a two-year occupation of the capital of Peru, Lima. The ultimate result of the war left a deep scar on the three societies involved, and the relations between Peru and Chile soured for over a century, although relations were stabilized to some extent by the 1929 Treaty of Lima. In 1975, the two countries were again on the brink of war, but armed conflict between left-wing Peru and right-wing Chile was averted. Relations remained tense due to alliances during and after the 1995 Cenepa War between Peru and Ecuador, but they have improved gradually, with the neighboring countries entering into new trade agreements in the 21st century. History of diplomatic relations =Rule under the Spanish Empire= After the conquest of Peru by Francisco Pizarro and his troops, Diego de Almagro went on an expedition to explore the lands of Chile that he had been assigned. After finding no gold and little more than farming societies and the fierce attacks of the Mapuche, Diego de Almagro returned to Peru with a broken army seeking to gain some sort of power and prestige. After attempting to overthrow Pizarro in Cusco, Diego de Almagro failed and was sentenced to death. Some time after the events of Almagro, Pedro de Valdivia led an expedition from Peru to Chile, then called \\"Nuevo Toledo\\", that ended in the creation of Santiago de la Nueva Extremadura and the Captaincy General of Chile. The lack of the treasures and natural resources that the Spanish valued (such as gold and silver) for their economy and the constant raids from the local Mapuche made Chile a highly undesirable place. As a result, during the colonial era Chile was a poor and problematic province of the Viceroyalty of Peru, and it took a while before settlers would begin to find the other natural resources of the lands. In order to protect themselves from further attacks and full- scale revolts (such as the Arauco War), and retain official control of the lands, the Viceroyalty of Peru had to finance the defence of Chile by constructing extensive forts such as the Valdivian fort system. In order to prevent other European nations from making colonies in these sparsely- populated areas, the trade of Chile became restricted to directly providing supplies, such as tallow, leather, and wine, to Peru. Moreover, a series of young officers in Chile made careers as governors of this territory, and a few even made it all the way to getting appointed viceroys of Peru (such as Ambrosio O'Higgins and Agustin de Jauregui y Aldecoa). This exchange of goods and supplies between both regions became the first recorded trade of both future nations. =Wars of Independence (1810‚Äì1830)= A series of excellent historical relations followed these times, especially during this period of independence from Spain. From the start of the Spanish conquest, the Incas (and later their mestizo descendants) kept up the struggle for independence from Spain in the viceroyalty of Peru. A series of revolts by people such as T√∫pac Amaru II kept up the spirits for independence in Peru and the rest of South America. Nonetheless, Chile's remoteness greatly helped in making it become one of the first nations to declare independence with the so-called Patria Vieja. Even as this first attempt was thwarted by the Spanish, the spirit of independence continued in Chile. Later, with the aid of Jos√© de San Mart√≠n and the Argentine army, Chile once again became an independent nation. Meanwhile, Peru remained as a stronghold for the remaining Spanish forces whom sought to form a force large enough to re-conquer their lost territories. Jose de San Martin's army which included some Chilean soldiers marched into Lima and proclaimed the independence of Peru. Soon after that, more reinforcements arrived from the Peruvian population and commanders such as Ramon Castilla began to prove themselves as excellent tacticians. The arrival of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and the subsequent victories at the battles of Junin and Ayacucho finally served as the end of Spanish rule in South America. Afterwards, several of these war heroes helped in forming good relations between the newly formed nations as they became prominent politicians in their nations. People like Bernardo O'Higgins, Ramon Freire, Agustin Gamarra, and Ramon Castilla would often seek aid and refuge in either Peru or Chile. After the wars of independence, the mutual concerns of both nations mainly revolved around consolidating their nations as sovereign states. Peru and Chile found themselves in one of the friendliest of positions as they shared no territorial claims and also due to their historic trade. The cultures of both nations also kept close ties as the popular Peruvian Zamacueca evolved in Chile as the Cueca and in Peru as the yet-to-be named Marinera. Still, economic disputes and greed would soon destroy that which was apparently one of the best international relations in the world at that time. =Formation of Peru-Bolivia Confederation (1836)= The formation of large, united South American nations was a popular idea that Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and a series of other prominent leaders of that time sought to form. Nonetheless, the problems began when the leaders could not agree where the center of power of this union would be located. Many of the leaders would soon figure that this union would not happen, and many (such as Jos√© de San Mart√≠n) went back to their regular lives in disappointment. Yet, in order to expand his personal dream of Gran Colombia, Bol√≠var allowed Sucre to form the nation of Bolivia in Upper Peru. This action led to much controversy as the republican government of Peru sought to re-consolidate its power in a region that had belonged to them under the Spanish authorities. This period of time was filled with much political intrigue, and soon a war erupted between Peru and Gran Colombia. The political turmoil in Peru stopped Bolivar's plans to reach Bolivia and keep expanding Colombia, but the warfare ended indecisively. The aftermath of this left Peru consolidated as a state, Bolivia formally recognized as a separate entity by Peru, and the beginning of the dissolution of Gran Colombia into the nations of the New Granada (today, Colombia), Ecuador, and Venezuela. Even though Peru had recognized the independence of Bolivia, the national sentiment among the Peruvian society and its politicians greatly influenced the events that would soon take place. Agustin Gamarra and Andres de Santa Cruz were the leading proponents of a union between these two nations during the 1830s, but each had different views on which nation would command the union. While Santa Cruz favored a Bolivian-led confederation, Gamarra sought to annex Bolivia into Peru. A series of political conflicts in Peru would soon give Santa Cruz the chance to start his plans, and led an invasion of Peru claiming his intentions were to restore order. A series of Peruvians felt betrayed by their own government as the president and several leaders of congress allowed Santa Cruz to divide Peru into two nations: North Peru and South Peru. The Peru-Bolivian Confederation was soon formed, and several leading powers of the day (Such as France and Great Britain) and the United States recognized the nation's existence. Politicians in South America would also form divided opinions about this new nation, but due to the political conflicts in the former states of the Greater Colombia, the main turmoil to this idea centered in Southern South America. Among the most heavily involved in this situation was the Republic of Chile. Famous Chilean leaders such as Bernardo O'Higgins and Ramon Freire openly favored the ideas of the newly self-appointed \\"Grand Marshal\\" Santa Cruz, but at the same time they opposed the regime that at that moment governed Chile. The government in Chile was also deeply divided as to what they should do about this new nation. A series of Peruvians, including Agustin Gamarra and Ramon Castilla, saw the situation as an invasion of Bolivia into Peruvian territory, and they went into exile in Chile in order gain support from the Chilean government. Nevertheless, as far as things concerned Chile, Peru still owed a debt to the Chilean government as a result of this government helping in the liberation of Peru from Spain, and both nations were still under a commercial competition as to which port would become the most important in the southern Pacific coasts (Callao in Peru or Valpara√≠so in Chile). Moreover, Chile saw the creation of this new Peru-Bolivia government as a threat to Chilean independence and sovereignty due to the major influence that the combined territories of Peru and Bolivia were beginning to form in the world, and the many important Chilean figures exiled in Peru that sought to take over and change the current Chilean governmental administration. Even though the Peru-Bolivian Confederation was still very young, the economic and infrastructure plans of Grand Marshal Santa Cruz had made a major impact in the economy of Bolivia, and the nation of South Peru also began to greatly benefit as a result of being free from the control of Lima and staying under the economic policies of Santa Cruz. The only state from this union that did not truly benefit was North Peru, and soon this state would begin to provide the greatest support for Chilean intervention into this situation. =War of the Confederation (1836‚Äì1839)= What eventually led Chile to form a liberation army (composed of Peruvians and Chileans) was the invasion of Chile by Chilean exiles in Peru-Bolivia under the leadership of Ramon Freire, who was under the support of Andres de Santa Cruz. The invasion of Freire failed, but the situation had escalated the bad relations between Peru-Bolivia and Chile. The first attack by the liberation army came without a declaration of war, and Santa Cruz was deeply offended by these actions that Chile was sponsoring. Nonetheless, in order to avoid war, Santa Cruz proposed a treaty of peace that would keep the relations between both nations at ease. Seeing this as a chance at formally setting forth a cause for war, Chile sent their ultimatum to Santa Cruz among which the dissolution of the Peru-Bolivian Confederation was included. Santa Cruz agreed to everything but the dissolution of the confederation, and Chile thus declared war upon the confederation. At the same time, the Argentine Confederation saw this as a chance to stop the meddling of Santa Cruz in northern Argentina and they also declared war upon Peru-Bolivia. The first battles of the war were heavily disputed by both sides, but they mainly came in favor of Santa Cruz. Argentina's first major attempt also became their last as the northern provinces, whom were sympathetic of Santa Cruz, began a major revolt against the war. This left the combined forces of Chile and Peru alone in the war against Santa Cruz and his Peru-Bolivian troops (some under command of former Chilean officers such as Ramon Freire and even a French officer named Juan Blanchet). The first major attack of this liberation army also turned into a major disaster as the people of South Peru completely turned against this liberation force, and Santa Cruz persuaded the commander of these troops to sign a peace agreement confident that Chile would accept it as it stated (along several other things) that the debt of Peru to Chile would be repaid. In Chile, the war at first met much opposition from the Chilean society as they did not approve of the war. Still, after the assassination of an important political figure in Chile, the situation became a matter of national pride. In the Chilean congress, the votes turned against the peace treaty and several of the military officers that had lost at this first battle were court martialed. The second campaign to attack Santa Cruz was better organized with excellent commanders such as the Chilean Manuel Bulnes Prieto and the Peruvian Ramon Castilla. This time they fought and eventually won an important victory in the Battle of Portada de Guias, and thus the liberation force was able to enter the city of Lima. Lima and the majority of the rest of North Peru met the liberation army with much approval, and even appointed Agustin Gamarra as provisional president. The victory was short-lived, though, as the liberation army retreated as they heard of a major army that would arrive soon under the command of Santa Cruz. Meanwhile, in the southern Pacific, a Confederate naval attack on Chile failed, but the victory was of mixed blessings as only one Confederate ship was sunk but the majority of the Chilean ships were badly and heavily damaged. Although Santa Cruz's army began to once again win a series of skirmishes and battles, a series of uprisings took the nation into instability. Santa Cruz could not be everywhere at once, and thus he decided to first finish the war with liberation forces and next deal with the insurrections. What came next was a surprising military defeat of the Confederate troops by the liberation forces as the Confederate forces began to split on opinions and the commanding skills of Manuel Bulnes Prieto proved superior to Santa Cruz, who was killed during the battle. Following this, Peru was once again unified, and Agustin Gamarra attempted to lead an invasion to Bolivia. The attack utterly failed, Gamarra was killed, and Peru and Bolivia entered into another war. Bolivia would once again invade Peru but, without Gamarra, Ramon Castilla became the most prominent military figure of Peru and troops were soon dispatched for the defensive. The success in this defense resulted in Peruvian victories that returned both Peru and Bolivia to the former status quo. Although the relations between Peru and Bolivia would eventually find a \\"friendly point\\" in terms for the defense of both nations, Peru and Chile once again showed heavy improvements in their international relations as Peru soon paid back the Chilean assistance for this war and later in the past debt owed for the original liberation of Peru from Spain. The only major conflict between these nations became trade in the Pacific Ocean, but the lack of a land border left this topic solely as a commercial problem. As far as it concerned the Chilean society, Peru was the nation's closest ally against a possible invasion from Argentina; and as far as it concerned the Peruvian society, Chile had faithfully aided Peru in maintaining its independence. The political leadership of Ramon Castilla in Peru would further bring peaceful relations with Chile. =Chincha Islands War (1864‚Äì1866)= The first major intercontinental event involving these nations erupted as a result of guano, a resource that was heavily demanded in the international market and that western South America (mainly in the territories of Peru, Bolivia, and Chile) had plenty of to sell. The main problem arose out of Spain's belief that Peru was not an independent nation and that it was simply a rebellious state. This deeply angered Peru, but during those times the close ties among the Peruvians and their Spanish relatives did not amount to much trouble. In fact, when Spain sent a \\"scientific expedition\\" team to South America, the people of Chile and Peru greeted them with much cordiality. Nonetheless, for reasons not clear to this date, a fight broke out between two Spanish citizens a crowd of people in Lambayeque, Peru. The \\"scientific expedition\\" suddenly turned aggressive as they demanded the government of Peru to give reparations to the Spanish citizens and a government apology. The response of Peru was simple, according to the government the situation was an internal matter better left for the justice system and no apology was due. Without knowing it, this was the beginning of what would turn out to be a war. As a result of this meeting, the Spanish expedition then made demands for Peru to pay its debt owed to Spain from the wars of independence. Peru was willing to negotiate, but when Spain sent a Royal Commissary instead of an ambassador, the government of Peru was deeply offended and soon diplomatic relations would turn for the worse. For Peru, a Royal Commissary was a custom that applied to the colony of another nation, while an ambassador was the appropriate title for a discussion among independent nations. Aside from this matter of technical names, due to the lack of good diplomacy between the Spanish envoy and the Peruvian minister of foreign affairs, the Spanish \\"scientific expedition\\" invaded the Chincha Islands (Rich in guano) of Peru just off the coast of the port of Callao. No war had been declared, but this action heavily deteriorated relations to a critical point. Meanwhile, the government of Chile sought to avoid a war with Spain and declared neutrality by officially denying provisions of armaments and fuel to Peru and Spain. Still, just as this order was put into effect two Peruvian steamers were heading out of Valpara√≠so with supplies, armaments, and Chilean volunteers. Although this was the only incident that went against the Chilean order, the Spanish fleet (no longer a scientific expedition) took it as a pretext to increase hostilities against Chile. Therefore, a week after refusing to salute the Spanish order to salute the Spanish flag by a gun salute, Chile declared war upon Spain. The first battle of the war went in favor of Chile as the Spanish fleet suffered a humiliating defeat in the Battle of Papudo. Still, in order to achieve such a victory, Chile used the flag of Great Britain in order to ambush the Spanish fleet in Papudo. The Chileans captured the ship they attacked, the Covadonga, and kept it for use in the Chilean navy. In Peru, the situation was still stuck on the controversy over the occupation of the Chincha Islands. The lack of action eventually led to two Peruvian presidents to be overthrown until Mariano Ignacio Prado and the nationalist movement of Peru officially declared war against Spain and offered to aid Chile and form a united front against Spain. By this point, Chile was in much need of assistance as the Spanish fleet had begun its mobilization against the first nation who declared war upon them. Under a policy of punishment to the South American ports of the nations that had defied Spain, the Spanish fleet bombarded and destroyed the port and town of Valpara√≠so. In Europe, the Spanish government was outraged at the Spanish fleet for it had defied orders to return to Spain before any blood was shed. Still, they did very little to stop the actions of Admiral Casto M√©ndez N√∫√±ez. The destruction of Valpara√≠so outraged several other South American nations including Ecuador and Bolivia (whom by this point had also declared war to Spain). Peru soon dispatched its fleet and admirals for the defense of Chile, and soon the Peruvian addition to the Chilean troops would make its mark as under the command of Peruvian admiral Manuel Villar the combined Peruvian and Chilean ships would effectively defend the Chiloe Archipelago from a Spanish bombardment or invasion. Prior to the battle, the Chilean and Peruvian ships had been waiting near the island of Chiloe for two Peruvian ships that were soon to arrive. The Spanish found out about this and dispatched their strongest ships to take care of this, and the ships of Chile and Peru were ambushed in Abtao (an island close to Chiloe). The Battle of Abtao thus took place, and although the result was inconclusive, the Spanish ships retreated after receiving heavy fire from the Peruvian ships Union and America. Later, the Spanish fleet went to bombard and possibly invade Peru by giving a direct attack to the port of Callao. The port of Callao by that point had already received much aid from across South America, and the Peruvian defenders of Callao stood side by side with Chileans, Ecuadorians, and Bolivians. The Battle of Callao would prove to be another disaster for the Spanish fleet as the defenses of Callao proved stronger and defeated them to the point of forcing the complete retreat of the Spanish fleet from South American coasts. All the South American nations viewed the result favorably as Spain was not able to take control of any of the Guano-rich deposits. Still, the greed of guano would soon lead the former South American allies into a war that broke an alliance of nations that had proven stronger united than separated. =War of the Pacific (1879‚Äì1883)= Litoral Department (Antofagasta) ceded by Bolivia to Chile in 1904. -Tarapac√° Department ceded by Peru to Chile in 1884. -Puna de Atacama ceded by Bolivia/Chile to Argentina in 1889/1899 -Tarata occupied by Chile in 1885, return to Peru in 1925. -Arica province occupied by Chile in 1884, ceded by Peru in 1929. -Tacna (Sama River) occupied by Chile in 1884, return to Peru in 1929. National borders in the region had never been definitively established; the two countries negotiated a treaty that recognized the 24th parallel south as their boundary and that gave Chile the right to share the export taxes on the mineral resources of Bolivia's territory between the 23rd and 24th parallels. But Bolivia subsequently became dissatisfied at having to share its taxes with Chile and feared Chilean seizure of its coastal region where Chilean interests already controlled the mining industry. Peru's interest in the conflict stemmed from its traditional rivalry with Chile for hegemony on the Pacific coast. Also, the prosperity of the Peruvian government's guano (fertilizer) monopoly and the thriving nitrate industry in Peru's Tarapac√° province were related to mining activities on the Bolivian coast. In 1873 Peru agreed secretly with Bolivia to a mutual guarantee of their territories and independence. In 1874 Chilean-Bolivian relations were ameliorated by a revised treaty under which Chile relinquished its share of export taxes on minerals shipped from Bolivia, and Bolivia agreed not to raise taxes on Chilean enterprises in Bolivia for 25 years. Amity was broken in 1878 when Bolivia tried to increase the taxes of the Chilean Antofagasta Nitrate Company over the protests of the Chilean government. When Bolivia threatened to confiscate the company's property, Chilean armed forces occupied the port city of Antofagasta on Feb. 14, 1879. Bolivia then imposed a presidential decree that confiscated all Chilean property in Bolivia and made a formal declaration of war on March 18, 1979.\\"Andean Tragedy: Fighting the War of the Pacific\\" Sater, 2007\\" The government of La Paz next called for Peruvian aid in accordance to the defensive alliance both nations had made in 1873, but Peru tried to negotiate a peaceful solution between Bolivia and Chile in order to avoid war. Chile, after finding out about the defensive alliance of Bolivia and Peru, demanded for Peru to remain neutral, and the Peruvian government decided to discuss both the Chilean and Bolivian proposal in a congressional meeting. However, becoming aware that Peru was actively mobilizing its armed forces while discussing peace, Chile declared war on both Bolivia and Peru on April 5, 1879.\\"Andean Tragedy: Fighting the War of the Pacific\\" Sater, 2007 Chile easily occupied the Bolivian coastal region (Antofagasta province) and then took the offensive against Peru. Naval victories at Iquique (May 21, 1879) and Angamos (Oct. 8, 1879) enabled Chile to control the sea approaches to Peru. A Chilean army then invaded Peru. An attempt at mediation by the United States failed in October 1880, and Chilean forces occupied the Peruvian capital of Lima the following January. Chile was also to occupy the provinces of Tacna and Arica for 10 years, after which a plebiscite was to be held to determine their nationality. But the two countries failed for decades to agree on what terms the plebiscite was to be conducted. This diplomatic dispute over Tacna and Arica was known as the Question of the Pacific. Finally, in 1929, through the mediation of the United States, an accord was reached by which Chile kept Arica; Peru reacquired Tacna and received $6 million indemnity and other concessions. During the war Peru suffered the loss of thousands of people and much property, and, at the war's end, a seven-month civil war ensued; the nation foundered economically for decades thereafter. In 1884 a truce between Bolivia and Chile gave the latter control of the entire Bolivian coast (Antofagasta province), with its nitrate, copper, and other mineral industries; a treaty in 1904 made this arrangement permanent. In return Chile agreed to build a railroad connecting the Bolivian capital of La Paz with the port of Arica and guaranteed freedom of transit for Bolivian commerce through Chilean ports and territory. But Bolivia continued its attempt to break out of its landlocked situation through the La Plata river system to the Atlantic coast, an effort that led ultimately to the Chaco War (1932‚Äì35) between Bolivia and Paraguay. In 1883, Chile and Peru signed the Treaty of Anc√≥n in which Peru handed over the Province of Tarapac√°. Peru also had to hand over the departments of Arica and Tacna. These would remain under Chilean control until a later date, when there would be a plebiscite to decide which nation would maintain control over Arica and Tacna. Chile and Peru, however, were unable to agree on how or when to hold the plebiscite, and in 1929, both countries signed the Treaty of Lima, in which Peru gained Tacna and Chile maintained control of Arica. =Military Regimes (1960s, 1970s)= Relations remained sour because of the war. In 1975, both countries were on the brink of war, only a few years before the centennial of the War of the Pacific. The conflict was fueled by ideological disputes: Peruvian General Juan Velasco was a left-winger while Chilean General Augusto Pinochet was a right-winger. Velasco, backed by Cuba, set the date for invasion on August 6, the 150th independence anniversary of Bolivia, and the proposed date when Chile intended to grant this country with a sovereign corridor north of Arica, in former Peruvian territory, an action not approved by Peru. However, he was successfully dissuaded from starting the invasion on that date by his advisor, General Francisco Morales Berm√∫dez, whose original family was from the former Peruvian (currently Chilean) region of Tarapac√°. Velasco later fell ill and was deposed by a group of generals who proclaimed Morales Berm√∫dez president on August 28. Morales Berm√∫dez assured the Chilean government that Peru had no plans for an invasion. Tensions mounted again when a Chilean spy mission in Peru was discovered. Morales Berm√∫dez was again able to avert war, despite pressure from Velasco's ultranationalist followers. =Cenepa War controversy (1995)= In 1995, Peru was involved in the Cenepa War, a brief thirty-three- day war with Ecuador over the Cenepa River sector of the Cordillera del Condor territory in the western Amazon basin. Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and the United States, as the guarantors of the 1942 Rio Protocol that had put an end to the Ecuadorian‚ÄìPeruvian War earlier that century, worked with the governments of Peru and Ecuador to find a return to the status quo and end their border disputes once and for all. However, during the conflict, a series of Peruvian newspapers brought forth information claiming that Chile had sold armaments to Ecuador while the war was taking place. This claim was promptly denied by Chile the following day on February 5, 1995, but admitted that they had sold weaponry to Ecuador on September 12, 1994, as part of a regular commercial exchange that had no aim against any particular nation. Due to lack of further information, Peru's president, Alberto Fujimori, put a momentary end to the scandal. However, the controversy was once again ignited when General V√≠ctor Manuel Bayas, former Chief of Staff of the Ecuadorian Armed Forces during the Cenepa War, made a series of declarations in regards to the armed conflict between Peru and Ecuador. On March 21, 2005, General Bayas was asked by the Ecuadorian newspaper El Comercio if Chile had sold armaments to Ecuador during the Cenepa War, to which he replied: \\"Yes, it was a contract with the militaries during the conflict.\\" Furthermore, General Bayas revealed that Argentina and Russia had also sold weaponry to Ecuador during the conflict. Later that same year, on April 11, Colonel Ernesto Checa, Ecuador's military representative in Chile during the Cenepa War, stated that Chile provided Ecuador with \\"ammunition, rifles and night vision devices\\" during the war. Moreover, the Peruvian government revealed that it held knowledge that during the war at least a couple of Ecuadorian C-130 transport airplanes had landed in Chilean territory to pick up 9mm ammunition, and that the Ecuadorian Air Force had planned three more of those armament acquisition voyages to Chile. Nonetheless, the Peruvian government at that time regarded this as a minor incident due to the fact that the Chilean Sub-secretary of Foreign Relations told the Peruvian ambassador in Chile on February 2, 1995, that the Chilean government would take immediate measures to stop any other possible operations of this nature. In response to the declarations made by General Bayas, on March 22, 2005, the government of Chile denied the claims and stated that the only registered sale of weapons to Ecuador was in 1994. Jaime Ravinet, the Chilean Minister of Defense, assured that any other armament transfer after the 1994 date had been illegal. Ravinet further stated that, after discussing the matter with his Peruvian counterpart, Roberto Chiabra, the situation had been resolved. Yet, the Peruvian government did not find the February 5, 1995, and March 22, 2005, declarations as acceptable or sufficient; and went on to send a note of protest to the Chilean government. Peru added that Chile, as a guarantor of the Rio Protocol, should have maintained absolute neutrality and that this alleged weapons commerce during the Cenepa War goes against resolutions made by the United Nations and the Organization of American States. =Edwin Donayre (2008)= Donayre became the center of an international controversy on November 24, 2008, when Peruvian media showed a YouTube video in which the general said \\"We are not going to let Chileans pass by (...) [A] Chilean who enters will not leave. Or will leave in a coffin. And if there aren't sufficient coffins, there will be plastic bags\\". The video, dated to 2006 or 2007, was recorded during a party at a friend's house attended by army officials and civilians. These comments caused widespread indignation in Chile, making headlines in the El Mercurio newspaper. The Peruvian president, Alan Garc√≠a, called his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet, to explain that these remarks did not reflect official Peruvian policy. Bachelet declared herself satisfied with the explanations.CNN, Peru leader rejects top general's remarks on Chile, November 26, 2008. Retrieved on December 3, 2008.

In 2005, the Peruvian Congress unilaterally approved a law which increased the stated sea limit with Chile. This law superseded the Peruvian supreme decree 781 for same purpose from 1947, which had autolimited its maritime border to geographical parallels only. Peru's position was that the border has never been fully demarcated, but Chile disagreed reminding on treaties in 1952 and 1954 between the countries, which supposedly defined seaborder. The border problem has still not been solved. However, Chile's Michelle Bachelet and Peru's Alan Garc√≠a have established a positive diplomatic relationship, and it is very unlikely any hostilities will break out because of the dispute. On January 26, 2007, Peru's government issued a protest against Chile's demarcation of the coastal frontier the two countries share. According to the Peruvian Foreign Ministry, the Chilean legislatures had endorsed a plan regarding the Arica and Parinacota region which did not comply with the current established territorial demarcation. Moreover, it is alleged that the proposed Chilean law included an assertion of sovereignty over 19,000 sq. meters of land in Peru's Tacna Region. According to the Peruvian Foreign Ministry, Chile has defined a new region \\"without respecting the Concordia demarcation.\\" The Chilean deputies and senators that approved the law said they did not notice this error. For its part, the Chilean government has asserted that the region in dispute is not a coastal site named Concordia, but instead refers to boundary stone No. 1, which is located to the northeast and 200 meters inland. A possible border dispute was averted when the Chilean Constitutional Court formally ruled on January 26, 2007 against the legislation. While agreeing with the court's ruling, the Chilean government reiterated its stance that the maritime borders between the two nations were not in question and have been formally recognized by the international community. Nevertheless, in early April 2007, Peruvian nationalistic sectors, mainly represented by left wing ex-presidential candidate Ollanta Humala decided to congregate at 'hito uno' right at the border with Chile, in a symbolic attempt to claim sovereignty over a maritime area known in Peru as Mar de Grau (Grau's Sea) just west of the Chilean city of Arica. Peruvian police stopped a group of nearly 2,000 people just 10 km from the border, preventing them from reaching their intended destination. Despite these incidents, the presidents of both Chile and Peru have confirmed their intentions to improve the relationships between the two countries, mainly fueled by the huge amount of commercial exchange between both countries' private sectors. In 2007 the Chilean government decided, as a sign of goodwill, to voluntarily return thousands of historical books plundered from Lima's National Library during the Chilean occupation of Peru. Peru is still looking for other cultural items to be brought back home. On January 16, 2008, Peru formally presented the case to the International Court of Justice, in which the Peruvian government sued the state of Chile regarding the Chilean-Peruvian maritime dispute of 2006‚Äì2007. The court is expected to reach a verdict in no less than 7 years. In 2011, prior to new Peruvian President Ollanta Humala's visit to Bolivia in his pre-inauguration Pan-Americas tour, Peru agreed to cede territory claimed by Bolivia against Chile so as to facilitate resolution of the maritime claim. The 1929 Peace and Friendship treaty, which formalized relations between the three states following the War of the Pacific, requires Peru's \\"prior agreement\\" to pursue further negotiations for Chile to cede former Peruvian territory to a third party and settle the conflict. =Recent history= In late 2009, Chile continued a multi-national military exercise dubbed Salitre II 2009,http://salitre2009.fach.cl/inglish_salitre/what_is.htm which concerned the Peruvian government due to the planned scenario of a northern country attacking a southern country (Both Peru and Bolivia are the northern neighbors of Chile; and both Peru and Chile are expecting to receive a formal decision from the International Court of Justice). However, Chile eventually modified the scenario in order to deal with a dictator in a foreign continent. Airmen from Argentina, Brazil, France and the United States participated in the exercise. Afterwards, Peru's Chancellor Jos√© Antonio Garc√≠a Bela√∫nde expressed the Peruvian government's decision to neither attend the event or make any further comments on this internal affair of Chile. Nonetheless, upon the event's conclusion, Chilean congressman Jorge Tarud stated that the military exercise was a \\"loss for Peru\\" based on the idea that Peru used its full diplomatic force in order to prevent the event from taking place. Tarud also added that this was not an offensive exercise but for the maintenance of peace. Yet, Peru's major diplomatic action during this time was its proposal to create a non-aggression pact among all South American nations and to prevent further armamentism (increase in weaponry) from the nations of South America, which Tarud considered to be aimed at Chile. In November 2009 Peru detained a low-ranking air force officer on suspicion of treason for allegedly spying for Chile. Peru cited the incident as its reason for quitting the Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Singapore early that month. Chile has rejected the spying accusations and accused Garcia of overreacting. Chilean officials suggested he timed the espionage revelation to create a scandal at the summit where leaders were holding talks on regional integration. In 2014, the International Court of Justice resolved the Chilean-Peruvian Maritime Dispute of 2006, demarcating the sea border line between the two nations. Both nations are members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, Organization of Ibero-American States, Organization of American States, Pacific Alliance, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, Rio Group and the United Nations.

It is usually attributable to environmental phenomena such as heat waves, cold spells, epidemics and pandemics, especially influenza pandemics, famine or war. During heat waves, for instance, there are often additional deaths observed in the population, affecting especially older adults and those who are sick. After some periods with excess mortality, however, there has also been observed a decrease in overall mortality during the subsequent weeks. Such short-term forward shift in mortality rate is also referred to as harvesting effect. The subsequent, compensatory reduction in mortality suggests that the heat wave affected especially those whose health was already so compromised that they \\"would have died in the short-term anyway\\".The Impact of Heat Waves and Cold Spells on Mortality Rates in the Dutch Population Environmental Health Perspectives Volume 109, Number 5, May 2001 Different institutions and initiatives offer weekly data to monitor excess mortality. Significant efforts to capture short therm mortality data have been made along 2020 due to the pandemic of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and its worldwide effects. Eurostat launched in April 2020 a collection of weekly death data that provide for most of the EU countries weekly death data series (Weekly deaths - special data collection, demomwk) by 5-year age groups and sex an NUTS3 regions within the countries starting from the year 2000. This temporary data collection was established in order to support the policy and research efforts related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Data are transmitted by the National Statistical Institutes on voluntary basis and it is being updated, depending on the country, weekly. The Human Mortality Database project launched in May 2020 a new data series, the Short-term Mortality Fluctuation series (STMF), offering freely available weekly death counts by age and sex for a growing number of countries (34 in October 2020), as well as a visualization tool that captures the excess mortality in a weekly basis. The STMF was established to provide data for scientific analysis of all-cause mortality fluctuations by week within each calendar year in standard formats. As part of the HMD project, is a joint project of two teams based in the Laboratory of Demographic Data at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (MPIDR) and at the Department of Demography of the University of California, Berkeley (UCB). The collaborative network EuroMOMO (European mortality monitoring activity), monitors mortality across 24 European countries in order to detect and measure excess deaths related to seasonal influenza, pandemics and other public health threats. EuroMOMO is hosted and maintained by the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Prevention of Copenhagen, Denmark. They offer regular reports (weekly bulletins), graphs and maps showing the present levels of mortality but the network does not publish openly data. Individual partners may decide to share openly some selected national data, like for instance, MoMo-Spain. The study centre at the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen publishes a weekly situation report and regular scientific articles. Periods of high excess mortality have also been described for the United States.

It is one of 21 tributaries of Laguna de Bay and is regularly monitored by the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA) through one of its 15 river monitoring stations. The river's headwaters can be found in the Sierra Madre Mountain Range, particularly Mount Romelo for which the river is often alternately named. In this part of the river, a number of falls have become popular destinations amongst mountaineers, with a reputation for clear waters and a reasonably easy trek. The river then heads down into the coastal plains, going through the main population area of the municipality of Siniloan before finally emptying into Laguna de Bay. Throughout its watershed, from mountains to lowlands, the Siniloan is dominated by coconut and grasses. The mountain areas are also characterized by forests, while the lowlands are also characterized by rice paddies and residential areas. The Siniloan River sub- basin has a drainage area of . Tourist sites Cascading from the Siniloan's headwaters on Mount Romelo, five falls have become particularly well known among the locals and are frequented by tourists. These are: * Buruwisan Falls * Guiling-Guiling Falls * Lanzones Falls * Binaytuan Falls * Sebakon Falls Buruwisan Falls is the most popular because it is the most accessible among the falls. It has a drop of more or less , giving it a reputation as \\"an excellent training ground for neophyte mountain climbers.\\" The waters of Buruwisan eventually meet the waters of the Lanzones falls, and then lead to the much bigger Binaytuan Falls, which has a more or less drop. Conservation In the latest (December 2005 ) Water Quality Status Report listed on the Laguna Lake Development Authority's site, the Siniloan River was listed as \\"Class D.\\" It also indicated that this status had been \\"improved\\" from \\"worse than Class D\\" since the river was last monitored. According to the Water Usage & Classification for Fresh Water system used by the Philippines' Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Class D Quality freshwater is suitable for agriculture, irrigation, livestock watering and industrial water supply class II. The LLDA's conservation efforts for the major tributaries and watersheds of Laguna de Bay have led to the creation of the Laguna de Bay River Basin Councils, of which the Siniloan River Rehabilitation &. Management Fdn., Inc. (SRRMFI) is particularly tasked with conservation of the Siniloan. Through the SRRMFI, the LLDA implemented a World Bank-funded project in 2006 to control growing populations of the janitor fish (Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus) in Laguna de Bay. Released into the Lake accidentally during a typhoon in the mid-1990s, the species had become a major problem for the freshwater fisheries industry. The project involved paying fisherfolk P10 per kilogram of Janitor Fish, and converting it into feeds for use either in piggeries or in fishpens.

Persons using a treadmill desk seek to change the sedentary lifestyle associated with being an office worker and to integrate gentle exercise into their working day. History Persons with a sedentary lifestyle are at increased risk for heart disease, diabetes, and lower than average life expectancy.Several articles cited suggest that there are health risks associated with a sedentary lifestyle. This claim is corroborated by various medical articles, including the following: The desk treadmill is an exercise machine which office workers may use to get more physical activity during their work day. On the premise of increasing productivity and health, treadmill desks were designed to help users incorporate standing and walking into their work routine. Working models of Edeleson Treadmill Desks Nathan Edelson first proposed the idea of a treadmill desk. and published the first peer reviewed articles on the topic. His lightweight, portable version of a desk for use with a treadmill was patented in 1993. Edelson produced several prototypes that were used in a home and work office since the early 1990s with utilizing treadmills, stationary bicycles, and standing uptight to work. (see photos of prototypes) Dr. Seth Roberts, a professor of psychology from UC Berkeley designed a treadmill desk in 1996, was an early user. The New York Times credits Dr. James Levine, an endocrinologist at the Mayo Clinic, as the popular inspiration for the treadmill desk. He developed the concept as part of his work with non-exercise activity thermogenesis, constructing a treadmill desk by placing a bedside hospital tray over a $400 treadmill. After testing a treadmill desk in 2006 for several months under the supervision of Dr James Levine, Roger Highfield helped popularise the idea in the UK. He now uses one in the Science Museum in London and has advocated their widespread adoption. In 2009, the TrekDesk Treadmill Desk entered the market as the first height adjustable desk with a universal design which fit any existing treadmill. In 2013, novelist Amanda Filipacchi wrote an essay for the Wall Street Journal about buying a LifeSpan Fitness treadmill desk for herself and TreadDesk's the Tread for her partner after reading about Susan Orlean having a treadmill desk . In 2015, Move To Excellence began distributing LifeSpan Treadmill Desks in the Middle East. In 2018, the Director of the Department of Health in Abu Dhabi launched the 10k steps a day challenge while walking on a treadmill desk during the 2018 Arab Health event. Safety and usage specifications The recommended speed for walking on a treadmill while working at a computer is less than 2 miles per hour. To prevent injury, treadmill desks require compliance with the same ergonomic safety standards recommended for any computer desk, including placement such that the user's wrists are flat by the keyboard, their elbows form a 90-degree angle when typing, and their eyes may look forward to the monitor. Treadmill desks are equipped with safety features to minimize the possibility for injury. A safety key attaches the console to an article of clothing on the user. The key can be pulled at any time to immediately stop the treadmill belt. Many treadmill desks are programmed to pause the belt if the user steps off for more than 20 seconds during a workout. A movement indicator is typically printed on the belt of the treadmill to show belt movement. Users who tested treadmill desks reported advice to retain a traditional desk with a seat and to alternate between sitting and walking at different desks while becoming accustomed to the treadmill desk. Additionally, reading email and surfing the Internet were found to be easier to manage than learning to type or write while standing and walking. Talking on the phone while walking can be disruptive in some cases either because of changing the breathing rate of the user or because of the noise from the treadmill itself. A treadmill desk is not intended to provide aerobic exercise, but rather to keep the user's metabolism over the basal metabolic rate. Benefits of behavior modifications According to a study by James Levine at the Mayo Clinic, users can burn an estimated 100-130 calories per hour at speeds slower than 2 miles per hour. According to a 2007 Mayo Clinic study of office workers with obesity, \\"If sitting computer-time were replaced by walking-and-working, energy expenditure could increase by 100 cal/h. Thus, if obese individuals were to replace time spent sitting at the computer with walking computer time by 2‚Äì3 h/day, [...] a weight loss of 20‚Äì30 kg/year could occur.\\" However, when Levine and associates actually conducted a 12-month trial in 2013, findings showed that subjects lost an average of 1.4 ¬± 3.3 kg (3 ¬± 7.2 lbs), with a higher rate of weight loss among obese subjects at 2.3 ¬± 3.5 kg ( 5 ¬± 7.7 lbs). The energy expenditure of using a \\"walk-and- work\\" desk for office workers with obesity. It is not clear if treadmill desks are an effective intervention to reduce sitting. Prolonged sitting is linked to an ‚Äúincreased risk of heart disease, obesity, diabetes, cancer, and even early death.‚Äù A study published in the open-access journal PLOS ONE found that usage of a treadmill desk had a modest negative effect on the ability to recall sequences of numbers, indicating a possible effect on memory. However, the study noted its small sample size (75) and the possibility of an adjustment period as limitations, and the researchers suggested that treadmill desks have considerable benefits as long as the possible, possibly short-term effects on memory are taken into account. Styles and costs There are several types of treadmill desks available on the open market. Treadmill desks fall into three categories: * desks designed to cover a traditional treadmill * treadmills designed to fit under a standing desk * desks fabricated on top of a treadmill by original equipment manufacturer (OEM). In 2013 in the United States a product testing organization tested treadmills priced at $750 and $1500, and recommended that consumers purchase models with safety and personalization features appropriate for the individual users. Various guides to building a treadmill desk are available.

The pier was designed by P. Ashcroft. In its first year of opening the pier was a huge success and made an impressive profit for the time of ¬£581. Five years later a second pier was built close to the Wellington which had a very large financial effect on the profitability of the pier. By 1899 Great Yarmouth Corporation bailed out the failing business for the sum of ¬£1,250 and had plans to improve the entertainment and amusement of the pier. On 13 July 1903 a new Pavilion was opened and a failed Winter gardens was bought from Torquay and was incorporated into the design of the pier. Twentieth century In the early 1970s, the pier was substantially strengthened with major steelwork renovations. It was leased from the local council by entertainer Jim Davidson in 1996. He invested around ¬£750,000 of his own money; this was spent on the inside, but the outside was left as neither the lottery nor local projects would fund it. The theatre stood empty until it was partially demolished in early 2005. By late 2005 the front part of the pier has been totally re-developed as an amusement arcade. Between 2005 and 2010 shows were held at the theatre starring Jim Davidson and Bradley Walsh and featured support vocalists such as Tracy Dean. Since taking over the lease from Davidson, Family Amusements now run the entire Wellington and Wintergardens complex, along with the Britannia Pier further north on the seafront. The Winter Gardens was previously a large children's indoor play area, with cafe and bar. Oddly, the aluminium trussing installed by Jim Davidson as part of the Wintergardens nightclub has been retained - as it looks very futuristic, incorporating curves and other abstract shapes, However the Winter Gardens now stands empty having closed during 2008 due to concerns about structural integrity. The play equipment was removed in 2010 and the 1903 structure awaits its fate. By September 2008 the old theatre at the end of the pier had been converted to become a large bowling alley and bars. The original steel and ironwork has been restored and returned to the new building. The 100-year-old original girders are now visible, having been originally hidden in the theatre roof space. The newer building is so similar to the (demolished) old theatre that many visitors do not realise it is a new building. The ten-lane full-size bowling alley takes up most of the space in what was the old auditorium and stage space. An 80-foot-long stained-glass picture was found during the removal of the original Wellington pier theatre structure; it has been restored and will be the centrepiece of the entrance to the new complex. It depicts ships sailing into the port of Great Yarmouth.

He came to prominence in the early 1970s as a member of pianist Herbie Hancock's band, going on to lead his own electric/fusion groups through the decade. Henderson earned his medical degree and worked a parallel career as a psychiatrist and musician, turning back to acoustic jazz by the 1990s. Henderson's influences include Booker Little, Clifford Brown, Woody Shaw, and Miles Davis. Family influence and early music history Henderson's mother was one of the dancers in the original Cotton Club. She had a twin sister, and they were called The Brown Twins. They would dance with Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson and the Nicholas Brothers. In the film showing Fats Waller playing \\"Ain't Misbehavin'\\", Henderson's mother sat on the piano whilst Waller sang to her. His father sang with Billy Williams and The Charioteers, a popular singing group. At the age of nine he was given an informal lesson by Louis Armstrong, and he continued to study the instrument as a teenager in San Francisco, where he grew up, after his family moved there in 1954, at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. As a young man, he performed with the San Francisco Conservatory Symphony Orchestra. Henderson was influenced by the early fusion work of jazz musician Miles Davis, who was a friend of his parents.R. J. DeLuke \\"Eddie Henderson: Healing with Music\\" at all about jazz They met in 1957 when Henderson was aged seventeen, and played a gig together. After completing his medical education, Henderson went back to the Bay area for his medical internship and residency - and the break that thrust him fully into music. It was a week-long gig with Herbie Hancock's Mwandishi band that led to a three-year job, lasting from 1970-73. In addition to the three albums recorded by the group under Hancock's name, Henderson recorded his first two albums, Realization (1972) and Inside Out (1973), with Hancock and the Mwandishi group. After leaving Hancock, the trumpeter worked extensively with Pharoah Sanders, Mike Nock, Norman Connors, and Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, returning to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1975 where he joined the Latin-jazz group Azteca, and fronted his own bands. He also recorded with Charles Earland (popular for his version of \\"Let the Music Play\\" in 1978), and later, in the 1970s, led a rock-oriented group. While he gained some recognition for his work with the Herbie Hancock Sextet (1970‚Äì1973), his own records were considered too \\"commercial\\".[ Scott Yanow at allmusic.com] Medical career After three years in the Air Force, Henderson enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, graduating with a B.S. in zoology in 1964. He then studied medicine at Howard University in Washington D.C., graduating in 1968. Though he undertook his residency in psychiatry, he practiced general medicine from 1975 to 1985 in San Francisco, part-time for about four hours a day working at a small clinic. Henderson said, \\"The head doctor knew I was into music and he hired me with the stipulation that whenever I get tours I can go and come as I please. They would even pay me when I was gone. It was lovely\\", he recalled. \\"I just wanted to play music. But I never in my wildest dreams thought I'd ever have a chance to play with the big guys.\\" In the 1970s, Henderson recorded a series of fusion albums during the disco era that were later re-released. He recorded two albums on the Blue Note label, Sunburst (1975) and Heritage (1976); three for Capitol Records, Comin' Thru (1977), Mahal (1978) and Runnin' to Your Love (1979); and two for Capricorn Records, Realization (1973) and Inside Out (1974). UK success Henderson's only UK hit was the single \\"Prance On\\" recorded for Capitol which reached No. 44 in the UK Singles Chart in November 1978. The newly introduced 12\\" vinyl single format for this track helped promote it on the disco/club scene at the time. His previous single recorded in 1977, \\"Say You Will\\" / \\"The Funk Surgeon\\" failed to chart in the UK. \\"Cyclops\\" was an instrumental LP track only, although it was so popular at the wrong speed that Capitol pressed a 12\\" vinyl single with the regular version, and the fast version, back to back. In the 1990s, he returned to playing acoustic hard bop, touring with Billy Harper in 1991 while also working as a physician. In May 2002, he recorded So What?, an album of Miles Davis compositions, with Bob Berg on sax, Dave Kikoski on piano, Ed Howard on bass, and Victor Lewis on drums.

Plot introduction A mysterious terrorist organization known as the \\"FFF\\" has detonated a mine which bursts dykes in the Netherlands and caused massive flooding of Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport. Unless their demands are met (i.e. immediate withdrawal of all British military forces from Northern Ireland), they threaten to detonate more mines, flooding Holland beneath a wall of water from the North Sea.

Polygodial‚Äôs primary antifungal action is as a nonionic surfactant, disrupting the lipid-protein interface of integral proteins nonspecifically, denaturing their functional conformation.

Life Tatham was born near Gray's Inn, London, to George and Ann Tatham, and educated at Miss Jolly's school in Great Ormond Street up to the age of 16. Her older sister had died before she was born. Her biographer, a Methodist minister and family friend, states (pp. 3 and 7) that her father's family came from West Witton, North Yorkshire, and kept an upholstery shop in Holborn. Her mother came from Kent.Benjamin Gregory: Memoir of Emma Tatham... with \\"the Angel's Spell\\" and other pieces not published during her lifetime (London, Hamilton, 1859). A transcript of the legend on her gravestone appears on p. 124. The family moved to 7 Addington Square, Margate in 1847, largely for the sake of Emma's health (p. 35). She began to write poetry early, and from the age of 16 to 18, she rapidly wrote an abundance of poems. A collection of these appeared in 1854 as The Dream of Pythagoras and Other Poems and was reprinted at least three times. Thereafter some critics compared her to Mary Shelley. Praise from Arnold Matthew Arnold wrote in praise of her. He compared her with the French poet Eug√©nie de Gu√©rin,Matthew Arnold: Lectures and Essays in Criticism, ed. R. H.

He was the ALP State Secretary of the New South Wales branch from 2004‚Äì07. In February 2009, he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary for Government Service Delivery, a position within the Prime Minister and Cabinet portfolio. He later served as Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development, Minister for Sport and Minister for Social Housing and Homelessness. After former prime minister Kevin Rudd failed in a leadership challenge to Prime Minister Julia Gillard in February 2012, Arbib resigned from the ministry on 2 March, and from the Senate on 5 March. Arbib is currently a senior executive with James Packer's private investment company, Consolidated Press Holdings. He is the President of Athletics Australia and has previously been a board member of the South Sydney Rabbitohs and for Sydney FC. Personal Arbib was born in the Sydney suburb of Chippendale. His father, Eric Arbib, was of Libyan heritage and spoke Italian, moving to Australia in the 1960s and becoming a property developer. His mother, Lola, was born in Sydney. She raised Mark and his brother Scott after the death of their father when they were young. He has a Master of Arts in political science and economic history from the University of New South Wales. He lives in Sydney with his wife Kelli Field and two daughters. He is a supporter of the Sydney Roosters NRL club, Sydney FC A-League club, and is a public Ambassador for Australia's leading Indigenous non-profit education organisation, the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation. Arbib is an avid runner, having completed a number of Ironman triathlons and marathons. His personal best times are 11.09 for the Melbourne Ironman and 2.58.51 for the Sydney Marathon.  Early career While studying, Arbib worked part-time at a Sizzler restaurant in Bondi Junction. When there were moves to remove penalty rates, he negotiated on behalf of the part-time workers and signed up members to the Liquor Trades Union. Later he worked variously as a metal trades assistant, beach inspector and restaurant cook, but became increasingly involved in the trade union movement. In 1989 he had a bit part in the Australian soap opera Home and Away. He joined the Australian Labor Party in 1992 and was elected as President of NSW Young Labor in 1995. He served as Assistant General Secretary from 1999 and was the ALP State Organiser between 1996 and 1999. Career as General Secretary Arbib was elected General Secretary of the Australian Labor Party (NSW Branch) in June 2004. In 2005, he was elevated to the role of national convener of the party's right wing. In 2007, Arbib was Campaign Director for Morris Iemma's successful 2007 state election campaign. Following the 2007 Election victory for the Labor Party, he was credited by former premier Bob Carr as \\"one of the best campaigners in the business.\\" However, the opposition has criticised his role in procuring political donations for the Labor party from business groups. In January 2008, The Sydney Morning Herald quoted an organisation which makes political donations to the Labor Party as saying that Mark Arbib made an art form out of extracting political donations from businesses. Said the donor: \\"There's no doubt Arbib wrote the book in terms of both political donations ... and their importance ... It's fine to take the higher ground and say 'we won't make donations' ... but if you don't you have got zero chance of getting (to see them).\\" Arbib denied the allegations. Arbib was named in the ABC television program Four Corners in relation to political donations to the NSW Labor Party. Arbib was preselected for the number one position of Labor's New South Wales Senate ticket and won a seat at the 2007 federal election. Federal politics From 1 July 2008 to 30 March 2009, Arbib served on the Senate Committees for Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, Corporations and Financial Services, and Education, Employment and Workplace Relations. He was also the co-convenor of a bipartisan parliamentary group: Parliamentarians Against Child Abuse and Neglect (PACAN) and is an Ambassador of the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation. Arbib was a member of the ALP National Executive (from 2004) and a member of the ALP National Executive Committee (from 2007). In February 2009, he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary for Government Service Delivery. In the June 2009 reshuffle, he was promoted to Employment Participation Minister and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Government Service Delivery. On 24 June 2010, Arbib used his power as leader of the NSW right faction to shore up numbers to depose Kevin Rudd, then in his first term as Prime Minister, in favour of Julia Gillard. In August 2010 Arbib stood down from the ALP National Executive to concentrate on his portfolio duties. In November 2010 Arbib was the first Federal Labor Party front bencher to support same-sex marriage. He spoke in favour of marriage equality at Labor's National Conference in December 2011 and has called on the Liberal Party to allow its members a conscience vote. As Minister for Sport, Arbib championed a National Policy on Match Fixing in Sport which included nationally consistent criminal legislation. Arbib argued match-fixing was a threat to the integrity of sport and called for jail time for those found guilty of engaging in serious match-fixing and for the formation of an international WADA-type body to combat match-fixing internationally. During his time as Minister for Sport, Arbib was also a Member of the World Anti- Doping Authority Foundation Board. The United States diplomatic cables leaks revealed that Mark Arbib was in regular contact with staff at the US embassy in Canberra and provided them with inside information and commentary on the workings of the government and the Labor Party. Arbib strongly denied having a special relationship with the United States and was highly critical of Fairfax's reporting of the cables which he claims contained a number of serious factual errors.

His resignation from the Senate was submitted on 5 March. The following day on 6 March 2012, Arbib was replaced as a Senator by former Premier of New South Wales Bob Carr, who on 13 March became the Foreign Minister following the resignation of Kevin Rudd from that position. Post politics Following his career in politics, Arbib joined James Packer's private investment company, Consolidated Press Holdings, as Director of Strategy and Business Development. Arbib represents Consolidated Press Holdings on the board of the South Sydney Rabbitohs. He is also a board member of the Packer Family Foundation which in July 2014 announced a $200 million national philanthropic fund in partnership with the Crown Resorts Foundation. Sporting and philanthropic roles Following his role as Federal Minister for Sport, Arbib has gone on to serve in a number of roles with major sporting organisations. In April 2012 Australian Rugby Union (ARU) announced Arbib would conduct a major review into ARU's corporate governance. The review followed the decision of other major sports, including the Australian Rugby League Commission, Cricket Australia and Football Federation Australia, to review their governance structures. The recommendations contained in Strengthening the Governance of Australian Rugby (the Arbib Review), were endorsed in full by the Board of ARU in October 2012. On 10 December 2012, ARU's State and Territory Member Unions voted in favour of a new constitution adopting Arbib's recommendations. The changes from the Arbib Review established an Independent Board of Directors and reformed the Membership of ARU to better reflect the Rugby Union community across Australia, both amateur and professional. In May 2012 it was also announced that Arbib would join the board of Sydney FC, one of the A League's most successful football clubs. Arbib stepped down from Sydney FC in April 2016 to take up a new role as President of Athletics Australia after having been unanimously appointed to the position by his fellow directors. In his role as President, Arbib is looking to increase the reach and exposure of Athletics, including by making the sport more attractive to broadcasters. Arbib is also a board member of the professional Rugby League Team the South Sydney Rabbitohs, winners of the 2014 Premiership. Arbib is an active supporter of a number of philanthropies. In particular, he is an Ambassador for the Indigenous Marathon Project and for Australia's leading Indigenous non-profit education organisation, the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation. In October 2016, he was elected to the Australian Olympic Committee Board.

For nearly half a century, RHYC's Youth Sailing Program, and, more recently, its Graduate Program, have helped these young men and women develop the skills and attitudes they need to excel in international competition. The success of these is due largely to the work of dedicated volunteers from the RHYC sailing community. Recent awards won by young Hamilton sailors include the E. Aileen Clarke Youth Performance Ranking Trophy awarded to the highest-ranking Club in the 13 and Under Provincial Youth Regatta Series (2005, 2001), and the Unistrut Central Youth Performance Ranking Trophy for winning the 16 and under series in 1998. The Club has also figured prominently in international match racing. In 1978, RHYC's Don Green and his crew took Evergreen to the Bayview Yacht Club in Detroit to recapture the Canada's Cup for Canada.Penny, pp. 77-95. Evergreen's feats are commemorated in The Club's Evergreen lounge. RHYC sailors defended the cup successfully in 1981Penny, pp. 103-106. and 1984.Penny, p. 113. In 2008, RHYC celebrates the 120th anniversary of its founding, the 50th anniversary of its Youth Sailing program, and the 30th anniversary of RHYC yacht Evergreen's victory in the Canada Cup. =Notable Events= * 1895: Lake Yacht Racing Association (LYRA) * 1924: RHYC member Norm Robertson competes as Canada's first Olympic sailor * 1930: Sailing venue for the first British Empire Games * 1978: Don Green (Evergreen) recaptures the Canada's Cup from the Bayview Yacht Club * 1981, 1984: RHYC sailors successfully defend the Canada's Cup * 2002: RHYC hosts the International Europe Class World Championships, a qualifier for the 2004 Athens Olympics * 2003: RHYC hosts the LYRA annual regatta. *2018: Former NHL Goaltender Ray Emery found dead by drowning after a diving accident on July 15, 2018 Notes External links List of Civilian organizations with prefix \\"Royal\\" - Heritage Canada.

He became a captain in the French infantry service, from which he resigned on the outbreak of the 1830 July Revolution. Delvigne revolutionized rifle technology and rendered it proper as a weapon. Chambered magazines The method developed by Delvigne for his rifles, with the lead bullet being supported by a wooden sabot at its base. In 1826 Delvigne invented a new method which greatly simplified the use of rifled guns, and created a rifle known by his name. The problem was that the black powder used at that time would quickly produce a thick layer residue of fouling. After only three or four shots, a typical muzzle-loading rifle could only be reloaded by using a mallet to force the bullet down the fouled barrel. Delvigne addressed this problem by producing a rifle chamber smaller than the bore, with which it was connected by a spherical surface equal in radius to the ball used. The powder was poured from the muzzle into the chamber, upon which the ball rested when dropped into the bore. When forced against the chamber rim by ramming (with three strokes of a heavy ram), the originally undersized bullet would become deformed and flatten, so as to expand in diameter against the inside of the bore, allowing the bullet to press against the rifling grooves. When fired, the bullet would accompany the rifling and spin. This improvement preserved accuracy while reducing the time required to reload a fouled barrel.The Artillerist's Manual by John Gibbon p.125 =Wooden sabots= In an evolution to this first method, Delvigne introduced a wooden sabot at the bottom of the bullet which limited undesirable deformation of the lead bullet, but still allowed it to expand radially to fit the rifling grooves.The Artillerist's Manual by John Gibbon p.125 According to the artillery historian John Gibbon: In all these cases the radial deformation of the ball against the rifling grooves would permit a more efficient spinning of the ball, with the drawback that the deformation rendered the bullet aerodynamically less efficient. =Cylindro-conical bullets= Delvigne further developed cylindro-spherical (left) and cylindro-conical bullets (middle), which received the bullet grooves developed by Tamisier for stability. From 1830, Delvigne started to develop cylindro-conical bullets.\\"Delvigne began experimenting with elongated bullets as early as 1830. He designed a cylindro-conical bullet with a hollow base that would expand to fit the bore\\" in Britannica Online Encyclopedia [www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/156901/Henri-Gustave-Delvigne] The stability of the bullet was further improved by the introduction of the Tamisier ball groovings. However the introduction of ball groovings hampered the expansion of the bullet against the rifling grooves.U.S. Regulars Civil War Archives Delvigne's invention was further improved by the French officer Thouvenin, who induced the deformation of the bullet by placing a stem inside and at the center of the powder chamber. When hit by the ram, the bullet would expand radially against the rifling grooves and at the same time wrap around the stem, giving it a more efficient and aerodynamic shape.John Gibbon, The Artillerist's Manual 1860, p.135 These inventions mark important steps in the improvement of the rifle, and are precursors to the Mini√© ball, to whose development Delvigne contributed.

He has served an LDS mission to Ireland.* He studied violin with Richard Nibley and has played electric violin with singer-songwriter Mark Davis. In 1982 he completed a master's degree from Brigham Young University. He later received a Ph.D. from UCLA in Classics (concentrating on Greek and Indo-European mythology) which he taught for a year at USC. He also taught at UCLA and California State University, Northridge. He has been an independent researcher since 1993, drawing a regular income by working as an ADS specialist for a law office. Compton began his serious work in Mormon history as a Visiting Fellow at the Huntington Library studying the journals of Eliza R. Snow. He found that his Classics background helped his Mormon history work by teaching him respect for these primary documents. While researching, and trying to note people identified in Snow's journals, Compton found that he needed a good list of Joseph Smith's plural wives. Not finding one, he began researching his own list, which eventually grew into his 1997 book, In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith.  Publications  Compton's notable works include In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith, which was awarded the Best Book Award from both the John Whitmer Historical Association and the Mormon History Association. The Mormon History Association also awarded him the 2002 Best Documentary Award for his and Charles Hatch's book A Widow's Tale, The 1884-1886 Diary of Helen Mar Kimball Whitney, and the 1996 Award of Excellence for his article \\"A Trajectory of Plurality: An Overview of Joseph Smith's Thirty Three Plural Wives\\". Compton has contributed publications to the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS), including articles in FARMS Review of Books and Journal of Book of Mormon Studies and as an editor of the 1987 edition of Hugh Nibley's Mormonism and Early Christianity. He has also been published in The Encyclopedia of Mormonism, Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism, American Journal of Philology, Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, Sunstone Magazine, Classical Quarterly, and the Journal of Popular Culture. From 1993‚Äì1998, Compton served on the Editorial Board for the periodical Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought. Starting in 2004, Compton returned to work at Dialogue, this time as the editorial staff's History Editor. Compton has also served on the Board of Editors for the Journal of Mormon History since 2000. Compton's biography of Jacob Hamblin, A Frontier Life: Jacob Hamblin, Explorer and Indian Missionary, was published by the University of Utah Press in September, 2013. His article, \\"'In & through the roughefist country it has ever been my lot to travel'\\": Jacob Hamblin's 1858 Expedition Across the Colorado,\\" (Utah Historical Quarterly, Winter 2012) received the Dale L.

The story was written by Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams, with the latter also providing the art with Dick Giordano. It tells the story of Green Lantern and Green Arrow, who fight drug dealers, witnessing that Green Arrow's ward Roy \\"Speedy\\" Harper is a drug addict and dealing with the fallout of his revelation. Considered a watershed moment in the depiction of mature themes in DC Comics, the tone of this story is set in the tagline on the cover: \\"DC attacks youth's greatest problem... drugs!\\" Plot In the first part (Green Lantern/Green Arrow #85), Green Arrow (Oliver Queen) runs into muggers who shoot him with a crossbow. Strangely, the weapon is loaded with his own arrows. Tracking down the attackers, Green Arrow and his best friend, Green Lantern Hal Jordan, find out that the muggers are junkies who need money for their addiction, and are surprised to find Queen's ward Speedy (Roy Harper) among them. They think he is working undercover to bust the junkies, but Queen catches him red-handed when he tries to shoot heroin. It becomes evident that the stolen arrows are indeed Queen's, which he shares with Harper when they fight crime together. In the second part (Green Lantern/Green Arrow #86), an enraged Green Arrow lashes out at his ward. In shame, Harper withdraws cold turkey, and one of the junkies dies of a drug overdose. Queen and Lantern tackle the kingpin of the drug ring, a pharmaceutics CEO who outwardly condemns drug abuse, and visit the funeral for the dead junkie. Background During the 1960s, Green Lantern was on the verge of cancellation, which gave writer Denny O'Neil a great deal of creative freedom when he was assigned the series. O'Neil recounted that \\"my journalism background and laid-back social activism had led me to wonder if I couldn't combine those things with what I did for a living. ... So this was my chance to see if this idea I had would work. It was a situation where nobody had anything to lose. And I think that writing about things that really concerned me pulled out of me a higher level of craft. Also, it gave me real problems to solve in terms of craft which I hadn't faced before.\\" The first of these \\"socially motivated\\" Green Lantern/Green Arrow stories was written with Gil Kane slated to be the artist, but Kane dropped out and was replaced by Neal Adams. The O'Neil/Adams run met with a high level of media attention and critical acclaim including five Shazam Awards at the May 1971 ceremony, but by the time of \\"Snowbirds Don't Fly\\", Adams felt that they had run out of steam and were producing stories which lacked true relevance. He responded by pushing for a story dealing with drug addiction, an issue both he and O'Neill had been wanting to tackle, and had encountered firsthand: Adams was chairman of his neighborhood drug rehabilitation center, and O'Neil lived in a neighborhood with a large number of addicts. O'Neil recounted, \\"I saw people nodding out from heroin every day on the street. I had friends with drug problems, people coming over at 3 a.m. with the shakes.\\" When Adams first drew the cover showing Speedy with heroin paraphernalia, editor Julius Schwartz rejected it, since it would not have been approved by the Comics Code Authority. (The Comics Code prohibited the depiction of drug abuse, even in a totally condemning context.) O'Neil said that Schwartz \\"was very supportive\\" during his run on Green Lantern, and that he found the Comics Code to be his biggest restriction when confronting social issues. Then, Amazing Spider-Man #96‚Äì98 (May‚ÄìJuly 1971) was published by rival comic publishing house Marvel Comics, which showed major supporting character Harry Osborn struggling with drug addiction. It was the first comic from a major publisher to be published without the Comics Code Authority's seal of approval since 1954, when the Comics Code Authority was founded. Adams said: \\"We could have done it first and been the ones to make a big move. Popping a pill and walking off a roof isn't the sort of thing that really happens [referring to a scene in Amazing Spider-Man #96], but heroin addiction is; to have it happen to one of our heroes was potentially devastating. Anyway, the publishers at DC, Marvel and the rest called a meeting, and in three weeks, the Comics Code was completely rewritten. And we did our story.\\" Questioned why Roy Harper (Speedy) was chosen to illustrate drug abuse, O'Neil said that \\"We chose Roy [Harper] for maximum emotional impact. We thought an established good guy in the throes of addiction would be stronger than we... some character we'd have made up for the occasion. Also, we wanted to show that addiction was not limited to 'bad' or 'misguided' kids.\\" O'Neil's original ending to the story had Speedy overcoming his drug habit on his own and reconciling with Green Arrow. Adams protested that this ending was too anticlimactic. When O'Neil said he disagreed, Adams scripted two new pages on his own and showed them to Schwartz. Schwartz approved of Adams's revision and had it published instead of O'Neil's ending. In a 1975 article for The Amazing World of DC Comics, O'Neil stated that he still felt Adams's conclusion was not as good as the original ending: \\"I disapprove of the implied conclusion of that story. What‚Äôs implied is that a punch in the mouth solves everything.\\" Awards and recognition The \\"Snowbirds Don't Fly\\" arc won the 1971 Shazam Award for \\"Best Individual Story\\". New York Mayor John Lindsay wrote a letter to DC in response to the matter, commending them, which was printed in issue #86. In 2004, Comic Book Resources author Jonah Weiland called the \\"Snowbirds Don't Fly\\" arc the start of an era of socially relevant Green Lantern/Green Arrow comics, a slant which eventually opened up the DC world to other minorities (such as homosexual characters) and climaxed in the character of Mia Dearden (Roy Harper's successor as Green Arrow's/Oliver Queen's sidekick \\"Speedy\\"), who is not only a victim of child prostitution but also later portrayed as HIV positive. Despite her sad fate, she is explicitly portrayed as a positive, pro-active hero by writer Judd Winick.

A Microsoft Windows version, titled I/O Revision II, was released by Asgard on August 29, 2008. The game's soundtrack album, I/O Perfect Audiotracks, and the drama CD I/O Overbrowse Damsel, were both released by Five Records on February 24, 2006.  Reception  Writers for the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu appreciated how new developments occur after clearing each of the game's scenarios, and found that the game's worldview was consistent despite referencing various conflicting texts, such as the Bible and the Epic of Gilgamesh. They also felt that the game's use of themes such as virtual and real, human life and ontology gave the game a \\"cyber-science fiction youth\\" feeling.

MoM is commonly used to report the results of medical screening tests, particularly where the results of the individual tests are highly variable. MoM was originally used as a method to normalize data from participating laboratories of Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) so that individual test results could be compared. 35 years later, it is the established standard for reporting maternal serum screening results. An MoM for a test result for a patient can be determined by the following: :MoM(Patient) = \\\\frac{Result(Patient)}{Median(PatientPopulation)} As an example, Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) testing is used to screen for a neural tube defect (NTD) during the second trimester of pregnancy. If the median AFP result at 16 weeks of gestation is 30 ng/mL and a pregnant woman's AFP result at that same gestational age is 60 ng/mL, then her MoM is equal to 60/30 = 2.0.

History Orthodox Church of Ss. Helen and Constantine along Luba≈Ñska Street in Zgorzelec was built in large part thanks to the support of the local Greek community. The Greek Orthodox cemetery in Kalisz. Greeks, particularly merchants and traders,, have been present in the Polish lands since the Middle Ages, funding a number of Orthodox churches and cemeteries throughout the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. However most of these immigrants eventually assimilated into the diverse groups that trace their heritage from this polity such as Poles, Lithuanians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians.Topolski Jerzy (red) Dzieje Poznania, tom I cz. 1 do roku 1793, Warszawa-Pozna≈Ñ 1988, Pa≈Ñstwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe Most self-identified Greeks in Poland today trace their heritage to the large number of Greek citizens who fled as refugees from the Greek Civil War and were admitted into Poland. They consisted largely of members of former communist partisan units from the Macedonia region of Greece. Most had been farmers before their flight from Greece. In total, from 1949 to 1951, 12,300 people from Greece came to Poland, of whom roughly one-quarter were children. Most refugees arrived by sea through the port at Gdynia. The Polish government chose to settle them in the territories west of the Oder River near the border with East Germany, especially near Zgorzelec. About 200 were also sent to Kro≈õcienko in the southeast, near the Bieszczady Mountains in a formerly ethnic Ukrainian area. Initially, the refugees were celebrated as anti-capitalist heroes and given significant government assistance in building new lives and integrating in Poland. Initially, they found employment on farms, for which they were well suited because of their rural background; however, they later gravitated towards urban areas. Some refugees chose to return to Greece early on. By 1957, still roughly 10,000 remained in Poland. However, suspicions later fell on them of being Titoist agents. A large number were deported to Bulgaria in 1961. A 1985 agreement between the governments of Poland and Greece that enabled Greek refugees to receive retirement pensions at home, led to emigration back to Greece. The refugees belonged to different ethnicities, including half reportedly of Macedonian ethnicity and speaking the Macedonian language. Two Polish experts in Minority Studies, Alfred F. Majewicz and Tomasz Wicherkiewicz, claim that the Polish government cooperated with Greek refugees in forcing Macedonian refugees to adopt Hellenic names, and prevented them from opening their own schools and organisations. In 1950 the refugees from Greece were organized in the Community of Political Refugees from Greece (), based in Zgorzelec. Two years later it moved to Wroclaw and was renamed in 1953 Nikos Beloyannis Union of Political Refugees from Greece (). After the fall of the dictatorship in Greece it changed its name into Association of Greeks in Poland (), but in 1989, an internal schism led to the creation of the Association of Macedonians in Poland (). Minority status In his essay, published by the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, professor Slawomir Lodzinski states: > At present, the full legal protection is limited to this national minorities > which are groups of Polish citizens, are ‚Äúold‚Äù, ‚Äúnative‚Äù and on non- > immigrant origin. This perspective has caused that the groups of Greeks and > Macedonians who have been recognized as national minorities from the 1950s, > from the beginning of the 1990s are not treated as national minorities by > the state. Answering a question by Brunon Synak, President of the Kashubian-Pomeranian Association, at a meeting organized by the Council of Europe in 2002, Mr. Dobies≈Çaw Rzemieniewski, Head of the National Minorities Division in the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration, explained that Greeks and Macedonians are \\"not classified as national minorities since they do not meet the requirement of being traditionally domiciled on the territory of the Republic of Poland\\".

El Centenario had a 2015 census population of 6,068 persons. Since its establishment, El Centenario has grown as a suburb of La Paz. The majority of the working residents commute to La Paz or surrounding areas. In recent years, El Centenario has become a favorite location for United States and Canadian citizens to build new houses, either as vacation homes or as primary residences for retirement. The lower cost of living, when compared to the U.S., especially California or Florida, plus the rapid modernization of Baja California Sur, has made it an increasingly viable alternative to retire. New neighborhoods with growing English-speaking populations include Lomas del Centenario and Haciendas Palo Verde. History El Centenario was founded in the 1960s as an agrarian/fishing ejido by approximately 25 founding families. Each of the original families was delegated land to use for farming and on which to build a dwelling, while the land remained under the ownership of the communal ejido. During the 1990s, due to reforms associated with the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexican ejidos were granted rights to deliver legal ownership of ejido land to the members, thus changing from communal ownership to private ownership. Local tradition El Centenario locals eat nopal cacti as a main ingredient in tacos, which is unique in the La Paz area. This tradition was brought to El Centenario by the founding families when they moved from the interior of the Baja peninsula, where eating nopal is more common. In early fall, El Centenario holds a town nopal-themed festival. A carnival with rides and games is set up in the town center. A nopal cooking competition is organized by the BEDR 55 (Brigada de Educacion para el Desarrollo Rural No. 55), every year in early autumn (October). El Centenario is the town closest to CIBNOR, one of the leading marine biology institutes in Latin America. CIBNOR conducts studies of the Gulf of California ecosystem (also known as the Sea of Cortez) which is one of the most bio-diverse bodies of water in the world. Climate The general year-round climate in El Centenario is similar to that of La Paz, Baja California Sur, and is generally warm, sunny, and dry. The months of July, August, and September are the warmest and most humid, with August and September being the most likely months to receive heavy rainfall. One local weather phenomenon is the Coromuel Wind, which is a steady breeze that blows consistently during late afternoons in El Centenario. The winds are created when the cool marine air from the Pacific side of the peninsula are drawn over the desert to the relatively warmer side of the Gulf of California. Unlike most other parts of the Baja peninsula, there are no high mountains to block this air movement between the two sides of the peninsula. Population El Centenario had a 2015 census population of 6,068 persons. Since its establishment, El Centenario has grown as a suburb of La Paz. The majority of the working residents commute to La Paz or surrounding areas. As of November 2007, many El Centenario residents work at the San Juan De La Costa Mine and the Paraiso Del Mar Resort Development on the El Mogote Peninsula, due to the town's close proximity to these two locations.

The Arsacid dynasty of Iberia was succeeded by the Chosroid dynasty. History Once the Arsacids, in the person of Vologases II (r. 180-191), had consolidated their hold on the Armenian throne by 180, they gained momentum to interfere in Iberia. According to the medieval Georgian chronicles, the king of Armenia, whom Professor Cyril Toumanoff identifies with Vologases II, helped the rebellious nobles of Iberia overthrow his wife‚Äôs brother Amazaspus II of Iberia, last of the Pharnabazids, and replace Amazaspus with his son Rev I, whose reign (189-216) inaugurated the Arsacid dynasty in Iberia.Rapp, Stephen H. (2003), Studies In Medieval Georgian Historiography: Early Texts And Eurasian Contexts, pp. 292-294. Peeters Bvba . Even as the Arsacids set on the thrones of three Caucasian kingdoms ‚Äì those of Armenia, Iberia, and Albania ‚Äì the dynasty was dislodged, in 226, from power in its original homeland and the more powerful and dynamic Sassanid dynasty emerged as new masters of the Iranian Empire. Although the later Georgian chronicles documents this change of power, its account of that period is full of anachronisms and semi-legendary allusions, providing little or no details about the effect of Iranian resurgence on Arsacid Iberia. What we know of that period comes from Classical sources as well as Sassanid inscriptions. By replacing the weak Parthian realm with a strong, centralized state, the Sassanids changed the political orientation of pro-Roman Iberia and reduced it to a tributary state. Shapur I (r. 242-272) placed a vassal, Amazaspus III (r. 260-265), on the throne of Iberia, possibly a rival or anti-king of Mihrdat II. In 284, with the death of Aspagur I, the Iberian Arsacid line ended, and the Sassanids capitalized on a civil strife in the Roman Empire to establish their candidate, Mirian III, of the Chosroid dynasty, on the throne of Iberia.Suny, Ronald Grigor (1994), The Making of the Georgian Nation: 2nd edition, p. 15.

Brinkhous remained active in research until shortly before his death. Education Brinkhous graduated from the University of Iowa Medical School with an M.D. in 1932 and trained in the specialty of pathology there. His mentor, Dr. Harry P. Smith, led a training program that combined clinical aspects of pathology and laboratory research, the latter focusing on aspects of blood coagulation. While in Iowa, Dr. Brinkhous carried out research on hemophilia as part of a research team that included several other physicians interested in coagulation. Brinkhous made the seminal discovery of antihemophilic factor (Factor VIII) and showed that it was lacking in hemophiliac patients. His research in Iowa was disrupted by World War II. During that conflict, Dr. Brinkhous commanded an Army laboratory in Australia, which served as a reference facility for the U. S. military forces in the South Pacific. After the war he returned to Iowa, but did not remain there long. Career at the University of North Carolina In 1946, Brinkhous accepted the chairmanship of pathology at the University of North Carolina (UNC), and held that position until 1973. During his tenure, the department evolved from a two-faculty section, without a strong research presence, into a widely recognized research department. Brinkhous also developed a high quality of teaching and clinical service. He had a leading role in planning and implementing the pathology laboratories for the North Carolina Memorial Hospital that opened in 1952. Brinkhous was influential in the development and staffing of an expanded medical school faculty at UNC, especially in its clinical departments. His philosophy was that excellent teaching and clinical service required associated research programs of high quality. Brinkhous developed a coagulation research program at UNC, which stressed team efforts between researchers who worked in concert but from different perspectives. Throughout his career, Dr. Brinkhous recruited local students to research, many of whom became renowned scientists in their own right. He was an outstanding mentor, who combined friendship and personal concern with a demand for persistent, intense effort. Contributions made by coagulationists at UNC included the demonstration that hemophilia could be controlled by administering plasma containing Factor VIII, and the development of methods to purify and concentrate Factor VIII for use as a therapeutic agent. The partial thromboplastin test was also developed, as now used in hospital laboratories around the world. The team also investigated Von Willebrand disease, and studied the effects of snake venom on blood clotting. That work led to the use of proteases in treating victims of vascular thrombosis. Awards & Honors Kenneth Brinkhous earned many honors, including honorary doctoral degrees from UNC and the University of Chicago; the O. Max Gardner Award of the UNC Board of Governors; election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and to the National Academy of Sciences; and the Gold-Headed Cane Award from the American Society of Pathologists, an organization he had served as President. In 1997 he received recognition from the National Institutes of Health for the longest continuous extramural grant award (1947‚Äì1997). He was the professor and chairman of pathology for UNC from 1946 to 1973, and he was appointed Alumni Distinguished Professor of Pathology in 1961. Brinkhous was affiliated with a long list of organizations that included the American Medical Association (president from 1955 to 1956), the Universities Associated for Research and Education in Pathology (president in 1964), the American Society for Experimental Pathology (president from 1965 to 1966), the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (president from 1966 to 1967), and the American Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists (president from 1973 to 1974).

The archepiscopal see is Chamb√©ry Cathedral, located in the city of Chamb√©ry. The archdiocese encompasses the department of Savoie, in the Region of Rh√¥ne-Alpes. The current archbishop is Mgr. Philippe Ballot, formerly a priest in Besan√ßon. The diocese was created in 1779, from the Diocese of Grenoble, after a complicated earlier history. It became an archdiocese in 1817, even though at that point it was not within French territory. History In 1467, in the ducal chapel built for the Holy Winding-Sheet (Santo Sudario, better known as the Turin Shroud) by Amadeus IX of Savoy, and the Duchess Yolande of France, Pope Paul II erected a chapter directly subject to the Holy See, and his successor Pope Sixtus IV, united this chapter with the deanery of Savoy. In 1515 Pope Leo X published a papal bull making the deanery an archbishopric, but Francis I of France objected, and it was only in 1775 that this deanery was separated from the Diocese of Grenoble by Pope Pius VI, who, in 1779, created it a bishopric with the see at Chamb√©ry. Co-Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Saint-Jean- de-Maurienne The Duchy of Savoy, politically subject to the King of Sardinia, had thenceforth four bishoprics: Chamb√©ry, the diocese of Saint-Jean de Maurienne, diocese of Tarentaise, and Geneva (with residence at the diocese of Annecy). In October, 1792, the commissaries to the Convention formed the constitutional Diocese of Mont-Blanc, with Annecy as the see and Lyons as the metropolitan. The Concordat of 1802 created a Diocese of Chamb√©ry and Geneva, suffragan of the archdiocese of Lyons. A Bull dated 17 July 1817, made Chamb√©ry, once more a city of the Sardinian States, the seat of an archdiocese, with the diocese of Aosta for suffragan; the Dioceses of Annecy (re-established in 1822), Saint-Jean-Maurienne, and Tarentaise (in 1825), soon also became suffragans of Chamb√©ry. After the annexation of Savoy to France, in 1860, this condition continued, except that the Diocese of Aosta was made a suffragan of the archdiocese of Turin. Co-Cathedral of St. Peter in Mo√ªtiers The Cistercian Abbey of Hautecombe, founded in 1135, is one of the burial places of the House of Savoy. The relic known as the Holy Winding-Sheet of Christ was kept at Chamb√©ry until 1598, in which year the Duke of Savoy had it transported to Turin, where St. Charles Borromeo wished to venerate it. Notre- Dame de Myans (antedating the twelfth century), where St. Francis de Sales officiated, and Notre-Dame de l'Aumone at Rumilly (thirteenth century), whither Francis I of France went as a pilgrim, are still places of pilgrimage. The Sisters of St. Joseph, an order devoted to teaching and charitable work, were founded at Chamb√©ry in 1812. On 16 December 2002 the Archdiocese of Chamb√©ry became a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Lyon and ceased to be a Metropolitan.

Santly song At the Moving Picture Ball since they have a similar rhythm, similar subject matter and indeed they list the same silent-era movie stars. However, the song may also be seen as a simple literary archetype having nothing whatsoever to do with the Santly tune, and instead being a reflection upon things in life that, for whatever reason and with whatever lofty components assembled, never seem to work. Furthermore, since United Artists and its cadre were all of the same era and predominantly visible in their day, it's reasonable to conclude that any song written about the era would include Fairbanks, Pickford, Chaplin, et al, not as a borrowed vignette of someone else's work, but from the verified history.

The ethnogenesis of Serbs began in the Byzantine-Slavic environment, part of the wider Byzantine commonwealth. In the 11th and 12th centuries, the Serbs began fighting for independence, revolting against the Byzantines. In the following centuries, Serbia was independent and was mostly in friendly relations with Byzantium. Most of the queen consorts were Byzantine women (such as Eudokia Angelina, Simonida, Maria Palaiologina, Irene Kantakouzene, Helena Palaiologina). Some Byzantine families found refuge in Serbia at the end of the 14th and early 15th century, following Ottoman conquests, such as the Angeloi and Kantakouzenos; notable statesmen in the Serbian Despotate of Greek origin include Janja Kantakouzenos, Dimitrije Kantakuzin and Mihailo Anƒëeloviƒá. Modern history The first mention of a Greek school in Serbia was in 1718, with Stephanos Daskalos as a teacher at Belgrade. The Greek schools were much respected and were attended by children of famous Serbs. The Greek schools invited language teachers from Greece to teach at primary and secondary schools wherever there was a Greek community such as Karlovac, Smederevo, Zemun, Belgrade, Po≈æarevac, Kragujevac, Novi Sad, ≈†abac and others. Serbian Patriarch Kalinik II (1765-1766) was an ethnic Greek, and played a crucial role in the Ottoman abolition of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá in 1766. Rigas Feraios' memorial plaque in front of Neboj≈°a Tower The wedding of Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark and Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, 1923. Several Aromanian families (from Macedonia) were held captives by the Bulgarians in 1916 in Bulgarian-occupied Po≈æarevac (In Serbia) and stayed until 1918 when the Bulgarian front was breached and they returned to Greece.Y. Veligratlis, Interview in Serres, November 17, 2005. They worked at the Serbs' vineyards and in the homes of the Jewish merchant- families. However, a number of Greeks remained in Po≈æarevac, who were involved chiefly in commerce and in hotel enterprises, and with great success at that. Some of them became renowned, rich and eminent citizens of the city. Especially as owners of kafeneia (coffee shops), hotels. They gave Greek names to their kafeneia, such as \\"Itia\\" (willow tree) or \\"Kleousa\\" (weeping willow), \\"Ta Dyo Lefka Peristeria\\" (The Two White Doves), or \\"Kasine\\". The Greeks and Serbs were Orthodox Christians, and consequently their co-habitation was very good. Very frequently, and early on, weddings between Serbs and Greeks. With the passage of time, the second and third generations of the Greek settlers lost the Greek language, mainly because the Greeks were not living isolated or in groups, but very quickly assimilated into the wider Serbian society.Miroljub Manojlovic In May 1945, 4,650 Greek refugees, mostly male members of ELAS, settled in the Magliƒá village with the help of Yugoslav government. From 1945 to 1948, it was a sui generis case of Greek extraterritorial jurisdiction. The Yugoslav conflict with informbiro saw the Greek community divided between loyalty to Yugoslavia and the Comintern, and those who supported the latter left the country. The remaining 800 also emigrated to Greek Macedonia eventually, with only a few remaining. Greek politicians and organizations backed Serbia during the Yugoslav Wars. Greek volunteers fought alongside the Serbs in the Greek Volunteer Guard, a company of the Army of the Republika Srpska (–í–†–°, VRS). Following the Kosovo declaration of independence The Greek minority living in Serbia have turned to Greece to not recognize the unilateral secession in Kosovo by the Kosovo Albanians. They stated that the independence of Kosovo would endanger the stability in the Balkans and weaken the traditional Serbian-Greek relations. The appeal adds that a wrong decision in the matter by the Greek government would \\"ruin what has taken a long time to build between the two countries\\".

Rosenthal and J. Warrack, Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera (London 1974 impression), 327). was a British bass singer who made his career entirely in the United Kingdom, participating in concerts and becoming one of the foremost performers of oratorios and other sacred music. He had equally great success in a broad spectrum of operatic roles, ranging from Wagner to Gilbert and Sullivan, due to the strength and burnished beauty of his well-trained voice.  Early career  Even as a young man, Radford possessed a deep and resonant voice. He studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London, mainly under the conductor Alberto Randegger, but also received lessons from Battison Haynes and Frederic King. He had natural dramatic gifts which from the outset suggested an operatic career, but his early professional life was devoted particularly to oratorio and the concert platform.G. Davidson, Opera Biographies (Werner Laurie, London 1955), 236‚Äì238); see also Eaglefield-Hull 1924 (below).  Concert and Oratorio, 1899‚Äì1915  His debut was at the Norwich Music Festival in 1899.Arthur Eaglefield Hull, A Dictionary of Modern Music and Musicians (Dent, London 1924), 403. He appeared for Henry J. Wood at a Queen's Hall prom on 9 February 1900 in Arthur Sullivan's The Martyr of Antioch.H.J. Wood, My Life of Music (Gollancz, London 1946 edn), 137‚Äì138). He was also a soloist at Wood's Trafalgar Day Centenary Concert of 21 October 1905 (at which Wood's Fantasia on British Sea-Songs was first performed).Wood 1946, 190‚Äì191. In 1906 he became the principal bass soloist in the Handel Festival (The Crystal Palace) concerts, and remained so until the 1920s.Eaglefield-Hull, 1924. On 26 May 1911, he took part in the Sheffield Festival Chorus performance of J. S. Bach's Mass in B minor for the London Music Festival, with Agnes Nicholls, Edna Thornton, Ben Davies and others; on the following day he was with Gervase Elwes and others in the big Leeds Choral Union performance of the St Matthew Passion. He was also in the Leeds Chorus performance of the Mass in B minor, with Carrie Tubb, John Coates and others, in the 'Three B's' Festival' of April 1915, again at Queen's Hall, under Henri Verbrugghen with the London Symphony Orchestra.R. Elkin, Queen's Hall 1893‚Äì1941 (Rider, London 1944), 77.  Operatic career before 1914  As early as November 1900, Henry Wood had engaged Radford for his uncut performance at Nottingham of the first two acts of Tannh√§user (introducing the Paris version of the Venusberg scene for the first time in England), along with Robert Watkin-Mills and others.Wood 1946, 147. In 1904 he made his first appearance at Covent Garden, as the Commendatore in Don Giovanni under Hans Richter.Davidson 1955, 237; Rosenthal & Warrack 1974. He was again engaged for Richter's Ring cycle in 1908, taking the roles of Fasolt in Das Rheingold, Hunding in Die Walk√ºre,Davidson 1955. and (according to another source) Hagen in G√∂tterd√§mmerung.Rosenthal & Warrack 1974. In 1910 he joined the Denhof Opera Company. He was then engaged with the Grand Opera Syndicate at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and he was successively engaged by Thomas Beecham in his productions at various venues, including Covent Garden, Drury Lane and His Majesty's Theatre. In Beecham's production of Wagner's Ring cycle he again played Fasolt, opposite the Fafnir of the younger Norman Allin, who succeeded him as Britain's foremost bass. Among his best-known roles were Mephistopheles (Gounod's Faust), Osmin (Il Seraglio), Sarastro (The Magic Flute), the Father (Charpentier's Louise), Ivan the Terrible and Boris Godunov (title role), which he was the first to sing in English. In April 1914 he was in the first English-language performance of Wagner's Parsifal with English soloists (with the London Choral Society, Carrie Tubb, John Coates, Thorpe Bates and Dawson Freer).Elkin 1944, 64. His (English) Gurnemanz appears in highlights recorded under Albert Coates, with Walter Widdop and Percy Hemming (Amfortas).  Recordings, 1903‚Äì1914  Radford had an early and successful relationship with the gramophone, beginning with a song called 'Ho! ho! hear the wild winds blow' for the Gramophone Company in June 1903. His first 12\\" records were 'It is enough' and 'Lord God of Abraham' from Mendelssohn's Elijah in 1906-7 (supplementing 'For the mountains shall depart', and 'Is not his word like a fire' on 10\\" records): over the next few years he added 'I am a Roamer' (Mendelssohn), 'Nazareth', 'Vulcan's Song' (Philemon and Baucis), and 'She alone charmeth my sadness' (Gounod), 'O ruddier than the cherry' (Acis and Galatea), 'Hear, ye winds and waves' (Scipio), 'Honour and Arms', 'Arm, arm ye brave' (Judas Maccabaeus) (Handel), 'Arise ye subterranean winds' (Purcell), and many of the better and longer ballads of the time.J. R. Bennett, A Catalogue of Vocal recordings from the English catalogue of the Gramophone Company etc, (Oakwood Press, 1955). He recorded the standard bass and tenor duets ('Larboard Watch', 'The Gendarmes', 'Excelsior', 'The moon hath raised her lamp above', and 'Watchman, what of the night'?) with John Harrison, and also recorded English songs in quartette arrangements (e.g., Pearsall's 'O, who will o'er the downs so free?') with John Harrison, Maud Perceval Allen or Alice Lakin, and Edna Thornton.Bennett 1955: see also The Catalogue of 'His Master's Voice' Records up to and including November 1914 (Butcher, Curnow & Co, Blackheath 1914), 109‚Äì110.  After the First World War  Radford continued to record from time to time during the Great War, and was a valuable asset to the promenade concerts in that period.Wood 1946, 302. In 1917, he joined with the company of George W. Byng of the Alhambra Theatre in the first major project to record Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, together with the singers Nellie Walker, George Baker, Ernest Pike, Derek Oldham, Peter Dawson and others.P. Dawson, Fifty Years of Song (Hutchinson, London 1951), p. 126. Besides these, he recorded several new titles from his own repertoire in 1918‚Äì20.Bennett 1955. On 26 March 1919 he appeared at a Royal Philharmonic Society Concert singing 'Wotan's Farewell' (Die Walk√ºre Act 3) under Landon Ronald.R. Elkin, Royal Philharmonic (Rider, London 1946), 146. He appeared in The Dream of Gerontius with the Northampton Musical Society under Charles King on 29 October 1920, with Norah Dawnay and Gervase Elwes: this was to be the last occasion on which Elwes sang the work. The artists (together with W.H. Reed and others) stayed at the Elwes home at Little Billing for the occasion.W. & R. Elwes, Gervase Elwes, The Story of his Life (Grayson and Grayson, London 1935), 265. In 1920‚Äì22, he became a founder Director of the British National Opera Company, and also became an important member of its singing company.Eaglefield-Hull 1924; Davidson 1955; Rosenthal & Warrack 1974. He sang in two Philharmonic Society performances of Beethoven's 9th Symphony, first under Felix Weingartner in March 1924 with Florence Austral, Margaret Balfour and Frank Titterton, and again in October 1925 with Dorothy Silk, Muriel Brunskill and Walter Widdop, under Albert Coates.Elkin 1946, 153, 154. He continued to make recordings for HMV after the advent of the electric microphone in 1925. In late acoustic and early electric sets of Wagnerian passages, he is heard at some length (often opposite the great soprano Florence Austral), as Alberich in Das Rheingold, Wotan in Die Walk√ºre, and Hagen in G√∂tterd√§mmerung,Opera at Home (Gramophone Company, London 1927 Revised edition), 356‚Äì380. as Gurnemanz in Parsifal (HMV D 1025‚Äì29) and as both Hans Sachs and Pogner in Die Meistersinger,Opera at Home 1927, 252‚Äì265. all under the baton of Albert Coates: the recorded sound is mostly disappointing. In 1924 it was stated that in oratorio his voice was best suited to bass parts in The Creation (Haydn) and in the Handel oratorios.Eaglefield-Hull 1924. Radford is said to have suffered from ill-health all his life, and it was this handicap which prevented him from developing his career on the international scene. A photograph of him (but no account of his career) is shown by Michael Scott in his important survey The Record of Singing.M. Scott, The Record of Singing II (Duckworth, London 1979), p.181 fig. 133.

This ceremony blesses the child with a prosperous future and has taken on great significance in Korea. The birthday babies wear a hanbok and a traditional hat: a jobawi or gulle for baby girls and a bokgeon or hogeon (Ìò∏Í±¥) for baby boys. It is similar to the Chinese ritual of Zhuazhou.  History  In the past, the death rates for children were high and many children died before their first birthday, so it was an important milestone for the baby and parents. The whole village used to celebrate a baby's first birthday, sharing food and wishing for long life and fortune for the baby. It could also define who they would be when they grow older.  Doljabi (ÎèåÏû°Ïù¥): fortune telling custom  Doljabi (ÎèåÏû°Ïù¥) The highlight of the dol (Îèå) is a custom called the doljabi (ÎèåÏû°Ïù¥) where the child is placed in front of a table of foods and objects such as string, paint or calligraphy brushes, ink, and money. The child is then urged to pick up an object from the table. It is believed the one selected will foretell the child's future. For example, if the child picks up a paint/calligraphy brush or book, they are destined to be smart. If they pick up money, they will be wealthy; If they pick up food, they will not be hungry. If the child picks up the thread, it is believed they will live a long life. The types of objects placed on the table for the baby to choose has evolved over time as a reflection of society's evolving perception of successful occupations. However, many parents remain more traditional in their selection of objects to place on the table. This is followed by feasting, singing and playing with the toddler. Most often, guests will present gifts of money, clothes, or gold rings to the parents for the child at this time.  'Dol' food  Tteok, rice cake for doljanchi At home family members give thanks to Samshin (three gods who are believed to take care of the baby's life while growing up) by serving plain rice, seaweed soup, and rice cakes. For the party, parents prepare a special 'Dol' table, where food is stacked high to symbolize a life of prosperity for the baby. The table is set mainly with a rice cake of pretty rainbow layers, seaweed soup, and fruits. Miyeok guk (seaweed soup) is served on every birthday after the first birthday to remind people of what their mother went through to bring them into the world.  Modern Doljanchi  The celebration is usually held in buffet restaurants or wedding halls. Parents prepare some prizes for guests and upon entering the party, everyone gets a piece of paper on which a number is written. During the party guests who correctly answer a question about the baby win a prize. The host of the party, or an entertainer, also calls out a number randomly, and the person who has that number receives a prize. Alternatively, guests bet on which item the baby will choose at the Doljabi (fortune-telling game) to win a prize.

Characteristics The adult male is twice the size of the adult female The male cockatoo dwarf cichlid reaches a body length of 8 centimetres. The female is considerably smaller, reaching only 5 centimetres. The body shape is long and of middle height and the mouth is rather big with thick lips. The male is more colorful than the female, usually with red/orange dorsal and caudal fins. The leading 3 or 4 hard rays are elongated, and the ventral fins are clear. In color, the female is quite dull but with a clear black line running along her flanks. Her background color is a pale yellow, but this will become vibrant when mating or brood protecting. In addition, she lacks the elongated dorsal rays of the male and her ventral fins show a black leading edge. There are several color forms which naturally occur in the wild; these include blues, yellows and some reds. Because of selective breeding the colors are now much more pronounced. Both sexes have a dark line leading from the eye to the bottom of the gill flap. Range and habitat The cockatoo dwarf cichlid is found in the Amazon River basin, in tributaries of the Ucayali, Amazon and Solim√µes rivers from the Pachitea River to Tabatinga in Peru and Colombia where it lives in small shallow streams or lagoon-like waters in the rain forest. The fish prefer a water temperature between 24 and 28 ¬∞C. The bottom of these waters is covered with leaves that are used by the fish for hiding. Breeding Female with newly free-swimming fry The female places her eggs inside the roof of a cavity or underneath a leaf. She takes care of the eggs by herself, while the male guards the territory. The eggs are salmon colored. One of the more interesting traits of Apistogramma cacatuoides is that of \\"sneaker\\" males. Due to the aggressive, territorial nature of the males, a submissive male will not develop the full \\"cockatoo\\" finnage nor the full male coloration. He will \\"pretend\\" to be a female and take any opportunities presented to mate with willing females. If the dominant male then dies, this submissive male will then develop the full finnage. Small aquaria (less than 120 litres) should be avoided if more than a single pair is to be kept, as a female will protect an area of approximately 30 centimeters in radius. If breeding is to be attempted in a community aquarium, fast-swimming fish should be avoided as they will poach the fry from the female A. cacatuoides. Maintenance in the aquarium A female and her offspring The cockatoo dwarf is one of the best suited cichlid species for the planted aquarium. But because the male is highly territorial, the fish should be kept in pairs, trios (one male with two females), or harems (one male with many females), and in the company of peaceful tankmates like tetras. In the case of very large Aquariums, more males can be kept together, provided there is plenty of territory, such as wood, heavy planting, and caves. Females also can be highly territorial, not only when in brood care. Water conditions should be maintained in the pH 6.5-pH 8.0 range. These are one of the few South American Dwarf Cichlids that can tolerate alkaline water.

Rager was born in Cairo, though immediately after his birth, his family moved to Mandate Palestine and settled in Jerusalem. In his IDF service he reached the rank of lieutenant colonel and took part in the Six-Day War. Rager had two children: Eviatar Rager (born 1959) and Avishag Goldberger-Rager (born 1970), both of whom reside in Israel. After his discharge he worked in the mass media; among his posts were as European correspondent for Kol Israel, the Israeli national radio service, editor of the periodical HaYom and director-general of the Israel Broadcasting Authority. During that period, he was affiliated with the General Zionists, a centrist political party, and particularly aligned with Yitzhak Rokeach. On behalf of Israel's Foreign Service, Rager was posted to New York as a consul, where he focused on the international efforts to open the gates of emigration from the USSR for Soviet Jewry. Afterwards he was made world president of the State of Israel Bonds. As a business entrepreneur, Rager was among the founders of Kanyon HaNegev (lit. Negev Mall), the Negev's largest commercial center and one of the group established by Canadian developer David Azrieli. Its success was the source of some conflict in Beersheba. Proponents touted the Kanyon's successful businesses and how the modernized facility offered local residents amenities comparable to the Westernized center of the country and abroad, purportedly raising their standard of living. However, the competition badly harmed the businesses of Beersheba's Old City, which have yet to recover. Yitzhak Rager, running as the Likud party's candidate, was elected to the mayoralty in 1989. He was re-elected and served until a total of eight years until his death. Through his efforts, in 1992 Beersheba was designated a prime development area, resulting in major strides in its advancement and the absorption of tens of thousands of new immigrants. In his memory, a principal thoroughfare in Beersheba was renamed Yitzhak Rager Boulevard. It connects Ben Gurion University of the Negev, the Soroka Medical Center, the Beersheba municipality, and the Negev Mall.

It is located 10 km from the provincial capital, Murcia. It borders the towns of Las Torres de Cotillas, Alguazas, Lorqu√≠, Ulea, Archena, Abar√°n, Blanca, Murcia and Fortuna. It has the fourth largest population in the region after Murcia, Cartagena and Lorca, with over 60,000 inhabitants. It is located 10 km north of the capital. The N-301 highway, that runs from Madrid to Cartagena, passes through it. The town has a line of walls dating to the Almohad era (11th-13th centuries). Molina de Segura is home to confectionery makers Vidal Golosinas, Jake S.A and S√°nchez Cano (also known as Fini).  History  = From the Prehistory to the Middle Ages = There is evidence of human presence in the municipality from the Middle Paleolithic that consists in a site named Las Toscas-El Chorico. Molina del Segura was also inhabited by people belonging to the Argaric civilisation. One group of remains is located in a hill in the east end of the territory. As a matter of fact, it also covers part of its adjacent municipality Fortuna. The site was originated in the Chalcolithic. There are some groups of remains corresponding to the Iberians. One site occurs in the northern half and the other in the east end. The Romans ruled large part of the Iberian gradually since 209 BC. They left in Molina de Segura a via or road that connected Carthago Nova (Cartagena) to Complutum (in the current Alcal√° de Henares in Madrid) and another one that connected Elche with Cieza. Apart from those viae, they caused the existence of more remains. There was a war in which Muslim peoples were involved with ruling the peninsula purposes and it begin in 711. The Visigothic king Theodemir and the governor of North Africa Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa signed the Treaty of Orihuela. It established Muslim sovereignty in the southeast of Spain, that includes the current municipality Molina de Segura. They built an alcazaba (Moorish fortification) in the early 11th century. It was part of a spot that was surrounded with walls. According to Arabic travellers, the territory was a crossroads. Besides, the main town, there was a settlement of that era. In 1243, the king of Taifa of Murcia signed the Treaty of Alcaraz. Consequently the former Taifa of Murcia would become part of the Crown of Castile. This condition was effective in Molina from 1266. The new kingdom of Murcia was repopulated during the following decades and this current municipality was part of that fact. The nobleman Alonso Fajardo granted excellent condition to the people from Christian kingdoms who moved to Molina de Segura with a document named Carta Puebla in 1396. The territory was named Molina Seca (Dry Molina) in documents related to Christian kingdoms. The current municipality passed on several owners until it belonged to the nobleman Juan Manuel. There are remains that Juan Manuel fortified the fortification.The population of Molina increased during the last centuries of the Middle Ages. After the death of Juan Manuel, Molina received vicissitudes caused by the desires of some possible owners. Finally, it was ruled by the Crown directly during the reign of Henry II of Castile. When Henri III of Castile was the king, the adelantado (governor) Alfonso Y√°nez Fajardo was bestowed the territory. = Early modern period and Late modern period = The social and administrative structures didn't vary considerably from the beginning of the Early Modern Period until the Spanish confiscation. There was a significant decrease in population and economy was adversely affected owing to the explulsion of Jews in 1452. Two disasters occurred in the mid-17th century: a plague epidemic in 1648, and a flood in 1651. After the flood, the irrigation system was formed again. As a result, there was an increase in agriculture matters and in population and it reached the highest level during the 18th century. The agriculture received modernisation in the vegetables and mulberry areas. The mulberry conditions lead to a splendour in the silk produced in Molina. The apogee also affected the town and a specific phenomenon of that is the construction of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Asunci√≥n Church in 1765. In the second half of the 19th century, tinning economic activities of the grown products started in Molina, but they were performed in a crafted way during the first decades. During that era there was a prevalence of the windmill industry. In 1916, the municipality started to have Molina de Segura as its name. Before the second half of the 20th century, the economy was based on agriculture and ranching. The most grown products were the peach, the apricot, the onions, the peppers, the tomatoes, some cereals, the almonds and the grapes. The most used animals in ranching were the sheep. The food tinning industry was developed during the first half of the century and that fact lead to a economy transformation in which it became mainly industrial. This industry reached its apogee in the 1940s, then Molina became one of the major tinning industry spot nationwide and even worldwide. During the 1990s the industry suffered an important crisis and some factories were forced to close. The secondary sector was diversified as a consequence.  Geography  The town of Molina de Segura is located in Europe, in the east of the Iberian Peninsula, belonging to the kingdom of Spain, and part of the Region of Murcia.

Life  Son of a wine merchant, he attended a gymnasium in Bremen, and then studied law at the universities of G√∂ttingen, Heidelberg and Munich. When his father died in 1830, he had to break off his studies, and spent six years working as a tutor in Courland. He then traveled to St. Petersburg and other parts of Russia. In 1838, he returned to Germany and settled in Dresden from where he visited much of Europe and wrote about his experiences. Future theories Kohl's main scientific work, Der Verkehr und die Ansiedlungen der Menschen in ihrer Abh√§ngigkeit von der Gestalt der Erdoberfl√§che (Transportation and settlement of people and their dependence on surface terrain) (1841, 1850) is regarded as the founding document of modern transport and urban geography. Using Moscow as an example, he formulated a mathematical theory for the development of spherical cities and how eventually these cities would develop skyscrapers and underground shopping centers. Similarly, also fundamental to the theoretical geography was his Die geographische Lage der Hauptst√§dte Europas (The Geographical Location of the Capitals of Europe) (1874).  Travels in Britain  In 1842, Kohl visited York. He wrote a lengthy description of the Minster and York's Quaker community (see pp.62-69 in Palliser and Palliser eds. 1979 York as They Saw It: From Alcuin to Lord Esher. William Sessions Limited.  Travels in America  From 1854 to 1858, he traveled in the United States. He prepared some valuable maps for the U.S. government, and at the request of the United States Coast Survey prepared two reports: History of the Discovery of the U. S. Coast and the History and Investigation of the Gulf Stream (Bremen, 1868). While in Washington and at Harvard, Kohl made friends with many writers (including Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Washington Irving) and scholars (including George Bancroft, Charles Bennett Deane and Louis Agassiz). Kohl's book Reisen in Canada und durch die Staaten von New York und Pennsylvanien (Travels in Canada and the states of New York and Pennsylvania; 1856) is still consulted for historical study into Pennsylvania Dutch. On his return to Europe, he settled in Bremen where he was appointed city librarian in 1863.

Peking Duck) is an eminent Serbian and former Yugoslav punk rock band from Novi Sad. Their debut album, Plitka poezija, released in 1980, is considered the first punk rock album by a band coming from Serbia. Being one of the first punk acts in Yugoslavia, they played a major role in opening doors for many bands that came after. On their second and last album, Strah od monotonije, released in 1981, they turned towards post-punk and darkwave sound, disbanding during the same year. In 2008, the band reunited to perform on the main stage of Exit Festival alongside Sex Pistols, and in 2010, they reunited once again, continuing their activity.  History  = Trafo, Caf√© Express, band formation = Pekin≈°ka Patka's roots are found in Trafo, a short-lived cover band formed in 1976 by electric guitarist Sreten Kovaƒçeviƒá with Neboj≈°a ƒåonkiƒá providing the vocals. Further featuring ≈†trc on bass and Zare on drums, the band performed rock standards covers of The Rolling Stones, Santana, Deep Purple, etc. The following year, Kovaƒçeviƒá formed Caf√© Express, a pop band featuring ƒåonkiƒá as guest vocalist in addition to Boba Mama on guitar, Aleksandar ƒåerevicki on keyboards, Aleksandar Kraviƒá on bass, Laslo \\"Cila\\" Pihler (Shital Puri) on drums, and vocalist Aleksandar Krstiƒá. During early summer 1978, ƒåonkiƒá (nicknamed Profesor ƒåonta), at the time 25-year-old teacher at Mihajlo Pupin High School in Novi Sad, visited London where, among various acts, he saw The Clash, The Specials, Midge Ure, Glen Matlock's Rich Kids, The Skids, and Magazine perform live, before returning home to Yugoslavia full of impressions and ideas about putting together a band with a new sound. In July 1978, Kovaƒçeviƒá, drummer Laslo \\"Cila\\" Pihler, and ƒåonkiƒá decided to form a punk rock group inspired by the British punk bands. The first lineup also featured bass guitarist Milo≈° \\"≈Ωure\\" ≈Ωuriƒá. The band held rehearsals at the University of Novi Sad's Faculty of Mechanical Engineering building where their first live performance took place. Four people attended the gig, all of them friends of the band members. After that, ƒåonkiƒá and Kovaƒçeviƒá started working on new material, mainly in Serbian language. Soon, Srbislav \\"Srba\\" Dobanovaƒçki became the new bass guitarist. = Local prominence in Novi Sad = The band's first official live appearance took place in December 1978 at Novi Sad's Klub 24 venue and immediately got the local public talking due to the commotion it raised among the club's staff who were sufficiently shocked by the performance that they decided to put a stop to it, sending the crowd of about 200 youngsters home. The immediate reason was the band's performance of an impromptu vulgar punk cover of a communist youth work action song featuring the modified lyrics \\"Bri≈æit Bardo bere ƒçiƒçke; Vidi joj se pola piƒçke\\" (\\"Brigitte Bardot is picking thistles; half of her pussy is hanging out\\"). The band based their act on melodic punk and vivid public image with high-energy live shows featuring constant jumping and gyrating that had a strong effect on the young crowds. Being one of the first groups in the country with this kind of sound and performing style, they attracted media interest before releasing any material. ƒåonkiƒá often used those media appearances for self-promotion, delivering sweeping statements like: \\"We're the first important thing to happen to Yugoslav rock since the days of Ivo Robiƒá and Marko Novoseliƒá\\". He also purposely courted controversy with soundbites such as referring to his group as the \\"first Orthodox punk band\\", which went against the doctrine of the ruling Communist League (SKJ) that very much promoted atheism in Yugoslav society. The band quickly developed a cult following among the sections of Novi Sad youth who expressed their devotion by spraying \\"ƒåonta je Bog\\" (\\"ƒåonta is God\\") graffiti throughout the city. All of this unconventionality also got the band plenty of attention from local communist authorities who saw subversive and incendiary potential in their sound and appearance. As a result, despite generating a lot of interest, not only in the city but also throughout other parts of Vojvodina, the band experienced problems with live performances, many of which would get canceled on the day of the show on suggestions from the authorities. In December 1978, the band played the last BOOM Festival, which was being held in their hometown that year. = Wider popularity and first releases = The band appeared at the Festival Omladina with the song \\"Bela ≈°ljiva\\". Vesna Vrandeƒçiƒá (later to join Xenia) won the festival's main award, but Pekin≈°ka Patka got the Audience Award. Their whole performance was broadcast on national television which was the first TV appearance of any punk band in Yugoslavia. This raised their profile as far as Yugoslav recording companies were concerned; they started negotiating with PGP-RTB label about a debut album, but ultimately could not reach a deal. The band continued playing and soon developed a wider following in bigger Yugoslav cities: Belgrade, Sarajevo and Zagreb. They eventually signed with Jugoton after its representatives saw them perform at Zagreb's Kulu≈°iƒá club. The first Pekin≈°ka Patka release became a vinyl 7-inch single (2-side) \\"Bela ≈°ljiva\\" / \\"Biti ru≈æan, pametan i mlad\\" produced by Slobodan Konjoviƒá. Relatively good reception of that single, with 35,000 copies sold, paved the way for them to begin recording a full-length debut album. In October 1979, the band was invited to perform in the village of Stepanoviƒáevo at the anniversary celebration of the end of World War II. The band performed their standard set- list and the show also featured blowing of condoms and throwing them to the audience as well as swearing on stage that was met with a mixture of shock and delight by the audience. Another punk rock band, Gomila G (a censored version of their original name Gomila Govana, trans. Pile of Shit), which played as the opening act, performed the song \\"God save Martin Bormann\\", which was also the reason why the authorities and the media turned against the two bands. Soon after the show, Gomila G bassist Borislav \\"Bora\\" Oslovƒçan joined Pekin≈°ka Patka as replacement for Dobanovaƒçki. Together they recorded a demo, consisting of seven tracks, which was unofficially released during the 1990s. The new lineup also performed at the Leto na Adi manifestation, which was held at a luxurious raft at Ada Ciganlija, with the song \\"Poderimo rock\\". Since the crowd rushed to the stage and jumped around, the raft almost sank. The album Plitka poezija (Shallow Poetry), a punk rock material with occasional ska elements and humorous lyrics, was completed by fall 1979, but Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito's illness postponed the release until summer 1980. It was ushered in by another 7-inch single, \\"Bolje da nosim kratku kosu\\" / \\"Ori, ori\\". The whole material was recorded in the Boris Kovaƒç studio, outside Novi Sad, and was produced by Slobodan Konjoviƒá, well known disc jockey from Studio B radio station. Eventually, their debut album was released in 1980 and sold about 15,000 copies, which Jugoton considered a failure. One of the first live presentations of the new material was at the Split festival with the band Azra. Several thousand people attended the concert. The relations within the band were somewhat strained at this gig. Dissatisfied with the band's decision to go on tour of Bosnia and Herzegovina, bassist Oslovƒçan played with his back turned to the crowd, while actively sabotaging the proceedings by purposely making the band sound as bad as possible. = Lineup changes, post-punk period = Following the debut album release, the band went through some personnel changes with some members changing instruments and others leaving altogether. Guitarist Kovaƒçeviƒá expressed a desire to play saxophone so he moved to that instrument while new member Zoran \\"Bale\\" Bulatoviƒá, a 17-year-old Peƒçat member, took over the vacated guitar spot. Second guitarist Prosenica, and bassist Oslovƒçan also left the band. Oslovƒçan was first replaced by Aleksandar \\"Caki\\" Kraviƒá and then the former bassist Srba Dobanovaƒçki until Marinko Vukmanoviƒá joined the band. Prosenica's spot stayed vacant as the band continued with only one guitar. That lineup did not last long as Kovaƒçeviƒá left the group during fall 1980 to form his own band, Kontraritam. The new lineup went on the successful Bosnia and Herzegovina tour, ending with a sold- out show at Sarajevo's Skenderija Hall. The band recorded the cover of the popular Dragan Stojniƒá chanson \\"Bila je tako lijepa\\", with altered lyrics, and released it on single with \\"Buba-rumba\\" as the B-side. Another cover version, this time The Hollies' hit \\"Stop! Stop! Stop!\\", appeared on the \\"Rokenroler\\" show broadcast on TV Belgrade. The song was used by JRT (Yugoslav Radio Television) station for representing Yugoslavia at the Montreux Rose d'Or festival. ƒåonkiƒá also planned to cover the \\"Hymn to Saint Sava\\", which was not approved by the rest of the band. During December 1980, the band performed at the Grok festival held at the Novi Sad Fair. The band left a good impression, but also caused an uproar by burning a copy of the Borba newspaper. During the intro for the song \\"Biti ru≈æan, pametan i mlad\\", ƒåonkiƒá said that the song was dedicated to Bijelo Dugme leader Goran Bregoviƒá. Soon after the show, Dnevnik journalist Bogdan ƒåetnik wrote an article demanding the band to be completely banned. From October 1980 until March 1981 the band prepared new material inspired by Joy Division, The Stranglers, The Cure and Magazine. The band changed the style to post-punk and dark wave, presenting a different sound and image, which mostly failed to connect with the audiences the way their debut did. The album Strah od monotonije (Fear of Monotony), released in May 1981, was sold in about 8,000 copies. The band performed rarely and their last notable shows were at a large concert at Zagreb Velesajam (performing with Riblja ƒåorba, Haustor, Film, Prljavo kazali≈°te, Leb i Sol, Parni Valjak, and other bands) and the Kalemegdan park which was their last concert, During the summer, ƒåonkiƒá went to serve the Yugoslav People's Army and by the time he returned, Bulatoviƒá was already the member of Luna and Vukmanoviƒá formed the pop band Primavera. = Post-breakup and reunions = In 1994, ƒåonkiƒá emigrated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada with his family and, after working as a pizza deliverer and computer programmer at Canada's state broadcaster CBC, he got a job as lecturer at Seneca College in Toronto. Bulatoviƒá moved to New York City during the 1990s. In 1997, their complete discography, including singles and albums, was re-released on CD format by Croatia Records (legal successor of Jugoton). Then on July 5, 2006, the same was done by Serbian Multimedia Records at which time the band got a significant promotional push from Serbian web magazine Popboks. On May 28, 2008, it was announced that Pekin≈°ka Patka would be reuniting to perform at the 2008 EXIT festival. Their performance took place on EXIT main stage on Sunday July 13, 2008 - the festival's closing night - together with Sex Pistols, The Hives, and Ministry.Pekin≈°ka Patka: Stari pankeri bez sakoa, Popboks, July 14, 2008 Pekin≈°ka Patka played a 40-minute set consisting of old favorites.

On May 5, at a press conference, the band announced the release of a cover album, featuring songs performed at the Yugoslav 1960s pop festivals such as the Opatija, Beogradsko Proleƒáe and Va≈° ≈†lager Sezone.\\"Povratak iz istorije Pekin≈°ke patke\\", Popboks.com A few days before the upcoming concert in Belgrade, the first lineup guitarist, and the co- founding member of the band, Sreten Kovaƒçeviƒá, announced suing the band over the usage of the name Pekin≈°ka Patka as well as the performance of the songs from the Plitka poezija album for which he is credited as author in SOKOJ (The Serbian Copyright Protection Organization).\\"ƒåija je Patka?\\", Popboks.com In the response to the announcement, the band responded at the Long Play record label official site with the explanation that ƒåonkiƒá has the right to the band name, and that in July 1980, without previously informing the rest of the band, Kovaƒçeviƒá had signed co-authorship to the debut album tracks at SOKOJ, thus the information on the authorship and at SOKOJ mismatch.Pekin≈°ka Patka announcement at longplay.rs Both the Belgrade and Zagreb performances featured the band playing most of the tracks from Plitka poezija, with the exception of the song \\"Bolje da nosim kratku kosu\\" written by Kovaƒçeviƒá according to SOKOJ, the upcoming single, the cover version of Luz Casal song \\"Un a√±o de amor\\", and the song \\"Neko\\", from the second album Strah od monotonije.\\"PEKIN≈†KA PATKA U SKC-u: Novi sako za pankera\\", Popboks.com\\"Patke i dalje lete kontra glavne struje\\", Muzika.hr However, the Belgrade performance did not feature Pihler on drums, and the substitute drummer was Veliki Prezir drummer Robert Radiƒá.

The Walker Lane takes up 15 to 25 percent of the boundary motion between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, the other 75 percent being taken up by the San Andreas Fault system to the west. The Walker Lane may represent an incipient major transform fault zone which could replace the San Andreas as the plate boundary in the future. The Walker Lane deformation belt accommodates nearly 12 mm/yr of dextral shear between the Sierra Nevada- Great Valley Block and North America. The belt is characterized by the northwest-striking trans-current faults and co-evolutionary dip-slip faults formed as result of a spatially segregated displacement field.Dokka, R.K., and Travis, C.J., 1990, Role of the eastern California shear zone in accommodating Pacific-North American plate motion: Geophysical Research Letters, v. 17, p. 1323-1326.

Established in 1921, the club plays at Hawthornden in Lasswade parish and competes in Scottish National League Division Two, the third tier of Scottish club rugby.  History  LRFC stand In 2003 the club sold one of its three pitches to the Local Authority, Midlothian, to fund the improvement of the existing facilities. The money has been ploughed into development with two international size floodlit pitches complemented by a 350-seater grandstand. The new facilities have been used by South Africa, France, New Zealand, Edinburgh Rugby, the Scotland 7s squad and the Scottish Women's Rugby Squad as a training ground. It has also been host to several champagne ties including Scotland under-19s v Italy under19s and a number of Scotland Women's Six Nations matches. After several consecutive seasons earning promotion, Lasswade 1st XV competed the 2010‚Äì11 season in the Scottish National League Division One and were promoted to the Scottish Premiership Division 3 for the 2011‚Äì12 season. Notable former players include the ex- Scotland national rugby union team and British and Irish Lions prop forward Peter Wright. Lasswade won the final of the SHE National Shield which was held at Murrayfield on Saturday 24 April 2010, beating Greenock Wanderers 17‚Äì7. In the same season they also won promotion to National League One (fourth tier) after finishing runners-up in League Two. In season 2010‚Äì11 Lasswade won promotion to Premiership Division Three, the highest league position in their history, by winning National League 1. The club also retained the Shield beating Hawick YM in the final 22‚Äì17. Following more league reconstruction by the SRU, in season 2012‚Äì13 Lasswade played in Championship League B. This is essentially the East league of the third tier of domestic rugby. Following further league reconstruction, Lasswade found themselves competing in the National League 3 in season 2014‚Äì15. In March 2015, Lasswade won the National League Division Three title but were relegated following just one season in the third tier. However, after finishing runners-up they immediately bounced back up to National League Division Two in 2017.

He played college football at Purdue University. Gorgal grew up in Illinois, where he was a standout athlete in high school. He then went to Purdue, playing as a quarterback and punt returner under head coach Stu Holcomb. Gorgal set a school record that stood for more than 50 years in 1948 by amassing 138 return yards in a single game. The Browns selected Gorgal in the 1950 NFL draft. He had six interceptions that season as Cleveland finished with a 10‚Äì2 win‚Äìloss record and beat the Los Angeles Rams to win the NFL championship. He then left the team for a two-year stint in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, returning in 1953. Gorgal was on a Browns squad that won another NFL championship in 1954, but head coach Paul Brown traded him to the Bears after the season. He played in Chicago in 1955, but a conflict with owner and coach George Halas, led to his release halfway through the following season. The Packers claimed him on waivers, and he played out the year in Green Bay. Gorgal then left football and settled in suburban Chicago, where he sold insurance. Early life and college Gorgal grew up in Peru, Illinois and attended the town's St. Bede Academy, a private Catholic high school. His father, Alex Gorgal, had played professional football in the 1920s as a wingback for the Rock Island Independents, an early National Football League (NFL) team. Gorgal was also a strong athlete, and lettered in track and field, baseball and football at St. Bede. He played as a quarterback and defensive back on the football team. After graduating from St. Bede, Gorgal enrolled at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana in 1946. He played quarterback, defensive back and returned punts for the school's football team. Gorgal set a Purdue Boilermakers football record in 1948 by amassing 138 return yards in a game against Pittsburgh. The mark stood for more than 50 years until it was broken by Vinny Sutherland in 1999. Purdue, however, finished the season with a 3‚Äì6 win‚Äìloss record under head coach Stu Holcomb. Gorgal accounted for most of Purdue's passing the following year in an upset victory against Minnesota, prompting Holcomb to say he had \\"a perfect game in directing the team on the field\\". Purdue, however, again finished the season with a losing record. Gorgal was also a center fielder on the Purdue baseball team. Professional career Gorgal was selected by the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League in the sixth round of the 1950 draft. The Browns were set to begin their first season in the NFL after transferring from the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), which had disbanded the previous year. The team had won each of the AAFC's championships in its four years of existence. Gorgal was given a $5,900-a-year contract with a $200 bonus and made Cleveland's roster as a starter in his rookie year, supplanting long-time safety Cliff Lewis. While Gorgal was large in stature for a safety of the era ‚Äì he was six feet, two inches tall and weighed about 200 pounds ‚Äì he had six interceptions in 1950, second on the team to Tommy James's nine. Led by an offense that featured quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley and ends Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie, the Browns finished with a 10‚Äì2 record and won the NFL championship by beating the Los Angeles Rams. Gorgal left the Browns after the season to serve in the U.S. Army during the Korean War. He was stationed back home in Peru and ran background checks for the Army's Counterintelligence Corps. Gorgal was discharged and returned to the Browns in 1953, helping bolster a defensive backfield that had been depleted by players' military service and Lewis's retirement. The Browns again advanced to the NFL championship game in 1953, but lost to the Detroit Lions. Gorgal had four interceptions during the regular season and two in the title game. Sportswriters named him a first-team All-Pro after the season. Cleveland continued to succeed in 1954, winning the NFL East division with a 9‚Äì3 record and beating Detroit for the NFL championship. Gorgal was injured and missed the latter half of the season; he had just one interception, although he returned it 53 yards for the only touchdown of his career. Cleveland head coach Paul Brown considered Gorgal one of his nicest players ‚Äì he was known as \\"Gurgles Gorgal,\\" the coach once said, because he \\"added so much fellowship and good feeling to our team\\" ‚Äì but nevertheless traded him along with defensive end Doug Atkins to the Chicago Bears before the 1955 season. Gorgal later criticized the trade, saying Brown dumped him because of his injury. Gorgal, who grew up rooting for the Bears, had six interceptions in 1955, when the team finished second in the NFL West division. He came into conflict with Bears coach and owner George Halas over his role as a leader on the team, however, and he was released on waivers halfway through the 1956 season. The rival Green Bay Packers claimed him, and he played the final five games of the season there. Gorgal considered Green Bay a lower-tier team and remained frustrated with his acrimonious departure from Chicago, and decided to quit football rather than play another year with the Packers. Later life Gorgal and his then wife, Irene, had bought a house in the Chicago suburbs during his time with the Bears. After retiring from football, Gorgal went back to Chicago and took a job in insurance. He later held a seat on the Chicago Board of Trade, a major futures exchange. Gorgal and his wife Irene Bittner had four children, Diane Eaton, Denise Giannotti, Mark Gorgal and Renee Beam His son Mark played middle guard for Purdue in the 1970s. He died on May 8, 2016 at the age of 87.Obituary References =Bibliography= * External links * Category:1929 births Category:2016 deaths Category:People from Peru, Illinois Category:Players of American football from Illinois Category:American football safeties Category:Purdue Boilermakers football players Category:Cleveland Browns players Category:Chicago Bears players Category:Green Bay Packers players ","title":"Ken Gorgal"},{"id":"14020667","text":"Durian Durian () is a 2000 Hong Kong film directed by Fruit Chan.

P. Joseph (May 10, 1872 ‚Äì June 17, 1930) was an attorney and Republican politician in the U.S. state of Oregon. A native of California, his family relocated to Oregon when he was young. There he would practice law and serve in the Oregon State Senate. Early life Joseph was born on May 10, 1872, in a log cabin on Joseph Creek in Modoc County, California.Colmer, Montagu, and Charles Erskine Scott Wood. History of the Bench and Bar of Oregon. Portland, Or: Historical Pub. Co, 1910. p. 85. The son of Delilah Jane Joseph (n√©e Heath) and Edwin Worthington Joseph, Joseph moved to Oregon in 1876 with his parents. In 1889, he graduated from high school in Lakeview, Oregon. He then studied law under the tutelage of two local judges, and worked as a retail clerk. Judge Townshend encouraged Joseph to move to Portland to pursue a career in law, and arranged for his employment there. Joseph moved to Portland and began working for the law offices of Watson, Hume and Watson in 1892. He passed the bar exam in 1893. Joseph formed a close friendship with Julius Meier, who was also just completing his law studies, in 1892. The two formed a partnership in 1895, and Joseph was retained as an attorney by Meier & Frank and by several individual members of the Meier family. Two years later, the Alaska gold rush hit, and Joseph traveled to Alaska with a Judge Adams to explore the opportunity. They staked a claim and established a mine. Joseph ultimately returned to Oregon poorer than when he had left, and resumed his partnership with Meier. During this period, Joseph found a respect for the political progressivism of Theodore Roosevelt. Joseph married Bertha L. Snell in the fall of 1903 in Drain, Oregon. Page 47 (lists 10/7/03.)https://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83045782/1903-09-13/ed-1/seq-22/ They had a son, George W. Joseph Jr., two years later. His son, George W. Joseph Jr., was born in 1905; George Jr. went on to chair the state hydroelectric commission, appointed by Gov. Meier, and also served as president of the Oregon mental health association. After Meier left the partnership to join his family's department store, Meier & Frank, Joseph partnered with Bert E. Haney to form the legal practice Joseph, Haney, and Littlefield.Oregon Voter Notably, he drew up and executed the will of his friend E. Henry Wemme, owner of the Mount Hood Company and, thereby, the Bull Run Hydroelectric Project and the historic Barlow Road. Joseph was a noted opponent of an effort to call a state constitutional convention in 1905, which was generally popular among Portland attorneys. Joseph married Bertha Snell in September 1903. Political career Joseph was elected to the Oregon State Senate in 1910 as a Republican representing Multnomah County. He served in the 1911 and 1913 legislative sessions. He introduced legislation supporting the 1912 amendment to the Oregon Constitution that established women's suffrage, and introduced Senate Bill 42 in 1911 that would have created a highway commission. He advocated for a large appropriation for Oregon's exhibit at the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition in 1915. He argued it was a unique opportunity to display its various economic offerings to the world; he asserted that an investment of $500,000 would \\"come back many fold\\". Joseph did not seek re-election in the 1914 election. In 1918, Joseph made a gift of the historic Barlow Road to a committee tasked with creating a commemorative highway between Portland and Mount Hood.https://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83025138/1918-12-04/ed-1/seq-14/ In 1920, Joseph was re-elected to the Senate.1921 Regular Session (31st).

During his time in the Oregon Senate, Joseph introduced numerous bills that would have promoted the development of hydroelectric power under public ownership. At the time, the state was home to less than 1% of the U.S. population, but was understood to possess 10 to 12% of the nation's potential hydroelectric capacity. Joseph's bills, however, were not taken seriously in the Senate. In late 1925, Joseph considered a run for the United States Senate, and received strong assurances from Henry Hanzen, a political editor, that the Republican nomination was his for the asking. He ultimately declined to run for national office, however, stating to Hanzen: (Had he won the nomination, he would have faced his former law partner, Democrat Bert Haney, in the general election.) In the late 1920s, the matter of Wemme's estate went before the Oregon Supreme Court. Joseph accused the opposing attorney, Thomas Mannix, of collusion with Chief Justice John L. Rand. In the ensuing controversy, Mannix filed disbarment proceedings against Joseph. Joseph then announced his candidacy for Governor of Oregon in the 1930 election, seeking vindication from the people of Oregon. Joseph was considered a populist candidate, and a prominent advocate for public development of hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River. He won the Republican nomination on May 16, defeating incumbent A. W. Norblad by over 5000 votes. In those days, the Republican nomination virtually guaranteed victory in the general election. About two weeks after the primary election, Joseph and Mannix were both permanently disbarred by the Oregon Supreme Court. Before the general election, however, Joseph died of a stroke, on June 17, during an army drill near the Oregon National Guard's Camp Clatsop (later renamed Camp Rilea).  Legacy  thumb The Republican Party nominated Phil Metschan to take Joseph's place on the ballot. Metschan, who had not run in the primary, opposed public power utilities, a significant departure from Joseph's platform. Joseph's friend and former law partner Julius Meier entered the race as an independent candidate, adopting Joseph's platform. Meier won the three-candidate election with 54.5% of the vote. He went on to pass legislation in accordance with Joseph's platform, highlighting those efforts in his 1935 address. Meier later unveiled a monument to Joseph at Camp Clatsop.Oregon Historical Quarterly, Vol. 32, No. 3 (Sep., 1931), pp. 287-296.

Jacobs, directed by Richard Cunha, that stars Ed Kemmer, Sally Fraser, and Buddy Baer. The film was theatrically released by Astor Pictures in March, 1958 as a double feature with She Demons. The make-up effects were created by Jack Pierce, known for his Universal Pictures' classic monster makeup for Boris Karloff's Frankenstein (1931), The Mummy (1932), and Lon Chaney Jr.'s The Wolf Man (1941). Baer, who played Vargas the Giant in this film, also played a giant in Jack and the Beanstalk (1952), starring Bud Abbott and Lou Costello. The film was shot in the San Bernardino National Forest. Giant from the Unknown was featured in 1996's late night TV show, \\"Nightmare Theater's Chill-O-Rama Horror Show\\". Plot The citizens of mountain town Pine Ridge, California, are concerned about a series of livestock mutilations in nearby Devil's Crag. A local, Harold Banks, is also found dead there, killed in the same manner as the livestock. Sheriff Parker orders everyone to stay away. Local speculation is that the deaths are supernatural in origin. Native American, \\"Indian Joe\\", confirms their fears of a tribal curse, but is driven out of town by the sheriff. Local geologist Wayne Brooks is told of Banks' death by friends Anne and Charlie Brown, two Pine Ridge siblings. Sheriff Parker is suspicious of Brooks, having heard about a recent confrontation between Brooks and Banks. As the sheriff is questioning him, Dr. Cleveland and his daughter Janet arrive in town. Cleveland is planning to do archaeological research in the area. While Brooks helps Janet pick up supplies, Parker warns Cleveland about the Banks murder. While at dinner with Cleveland and Janet, Brooks, formerly Cleveland's student, offers to be his area guide. Brooks tells Cleveland of a local Native American legend that evil spirits will rise up in Devil's Crag. He also says that Native American artifacts have been found there and that he has them. Dr. Cleveland reveals that he is searching for the remains of a Spanish expedition that he believes reached Devil's Crag 500 years earlier. The specific group Cleveland is tracing, known as the \\"Diablo Brigade\\", split off from the main expedition and was led by a huge man named Vargas, also known as the \\"Diablo Giant\\". After dinner, Janet agrees to go on a date with Brooks after he takes Cleveland to his field laboratory. At the laboratory, Cleveland is examining Brooks' artifacts when Janet opens a box with a small lizard inside. Brooks found it inside a rock, where it had been in a state of suspended animation for a long time. Cleveland continues examining it and the artifacts, as Indian Joe peers through a window, watching closely. When Brooks and Janet return, Cleveland excitedly calls them inside. He pieced together broken fragments into a cross and now theorizes that the Conquistadors influenced the locals hundreds of years before. The next morning all three go to Devil's Crag, and Sheriff Parker follows them in his police car. Parker pulls up and chastises Brooks for leaving town because he knows that Devil's Crag is off limits. Cleveland produces a permit from the Commissioner of Public Lands that allows him to conduct his research. Cleveland assures Parker that they are armed and can defend themselves. Unconvinced, Sheriff Parker leaves, and the small group sets up camp. The next day, while Brooks is examining the area, Indian Joe fires his rifle in Brooks' direction. Joe tells him that he is just hunting rabbits, but pointedly asks if they are there to rob Native American graves. Brooks assures him that they are only after Spanish artifacts, so Joe agrees to hunt elsewhere, warning Brooks that the place is evil. Brooks returns to camp and informs Cleveland that the area is changed. He theorizes that a recent electrical storm disturbed the whole area. They begin using their metal detectors to search but without success. Janet encourages Cleveland to give up, and he agrees to stop. She uses one of the detectors and by chance detects something. The spot is excavated and a cache of Spanish artifacts, armor, weapons, and bones are found. Brooks finds a rock formation similar to the one in which the lizard was entombed and discovers the handle of a massive, still intact axe he believes belonged to the \\"Diablo Giant\\". Brooks is forced to leave because of a large electrical storm, just before the \\"Diablo Giant\\" Vargas rises from the site's detritus. The next day, the group finds a large indentation in the ground and giant-sized armor and other artifacts. They discuss the possibility that like the lizard Vargas has been in a state of suspended animation and is still alive. Later that night, the body of the 500-year-old Vargas, revived by a lightning strike, stalks the group and eventually kills Anne Brown. Sheriff Parker accuses and arrests Brooks for Anne's murder because a medallion (one of his excavated artifacts) was found clenched in her hand. It is later revealed that the giant Vargas is roaming the wilderness after causing another brutal death. Local men from Pine Ridge help the sheriff hunt down the giant, who is causing more damage and deaths. Brooks is eventually able to kill Vargas, forcing him to fall to a watery death from a bridge spanning a raging waterfall.

An electrical signal sent to either crystal will be transformed into sound, which passes through the medium, eventually reaching the other crystal, which converts the sound into electricity, detected by a receiver. From the time taken for sound to move between the crystals and the speed of sound in the medium, the distance between the crystals can be calculated. Assortment of sonomicrometer crystals History Sonomicrometry was originally applied in the study of cardiac function in research animals by Dean Franklin in 1956, and was quickly adopted by biologists working in biomechanics as well as other physiological organ systems and structures (gastro-intestinal, uro-genital and musculo-skeletal). Medical device companies also use sonomicrometry to assess the physical performance, durability and longevity of devices during R&D; phase of development. Sonomicrometry is currently the most prevalent method for determining muscle length changes during animal locomotion, feeding, and other biomechanical functions. When originally developed decades ago, care was taken to orient the crystals correctly to ensure satisfactory signal detection between the crystals, but more modern versions of sonomicrometer hardware (typically dating from 1995 to the present) do not require such attention to crystal orientation. Sonomicrometer systems are used by scientists, engineers and biologists to measure the material properties of soft solids, gels, and fluids. Even though they are used to measure the mechanics and function of muscle tissue, there is no known medical or therapeutic use for these devices. Sonomicrometer devices are not used to treat or diagnose medical conditions in animals or humans. Mechanism The primary criteria for making sonomicrometer measurements is that the intervening space or material between the crystals must be capable of ultrasonic sound conduction in the frequency range of 100 kHz to at least several MHz. This typically means that the crystals must operate in or on a medium composed of fluids, gels, soft solids and some hard solids, and this includes biological tissues (blood, muscle, fat, etc.). The measurement of distance between crystals becomes problematic or ceases completely if air gaps or solid objects intervene between the crystals. Sonomicrometer measurements are only accurate when the medium surrounding the crystals or the object the crystals are measuring has a uniform speed of sound. In biological settings, almost all tissues have a speed of sound in the range of 1550 to 1600 meters per second, which is satisfactorily uniform to give accurate measurements to within 3% to 4%, and more typically to within 1%. A sonomicrometer device measures distance by performing a timing measurement of the sound transmitted by one crystal and received by one (or more) adjacent crystals. The ability to resolve small differences in this transit-time (or \\"time-of-flight\\") directly correlates with the ability to resolve small changes in the distances between crystals. The first generation of sonomicrometer devices were analog devices that integrated the time-of-flight as a voltage ramp function. Their resolution was a function of the slope of the ramp and the electrical noise of system components. Those systems output the length measurements as an analog voltage. The second generation of sonomicrometer devices were digital‚Äîthey measure time-of-flight by incrementing high-speed digital counters. Typically these are 12 to 16-bit counters operating from 32 to 128 MHz. A digital system will output length measurements in form of a digital number (the time-of-flight count value). Because of their digital nature, the resolution can be exactly specified as a function of counter clock frequency. For example, when making measurements in biological tissue at body temperature (velocity = 1,590 m/s), a digital sonomicrometer operating with a clock speed of 128 MHz will have a spatial resolution of 12 micrometres. Applications Sonomicrometry is often used in studies of animal physiology where precise distances at high temporal resolution are needed, particularly when such distances are not externally measurable. Sonomicrometry crystals are most commonly implanted within skeletal or cardiac muscle tissue to track length changes during an activity (heartbeat, flapping a wing, chewing, etc.). However, they can be very useful for tracking movement of entire structures which are not visible but immersed in fluid, such as the bones in the mouth of a fish during feeding.

In 1947 he created Shelby Cullom Davis & Company, which became a leading investment firm. He later served as the American Ambassador to Switzerland under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. Originally from Peoria, Illinois Davis' uncle was former Illinois Governor Shelby Moore Cullom. Education After graduating from The Lawrenceville School in 1926, he matriculated to Princeton University, graduating in 1930 and earned a master's degree at Columbia University in 1931. He earned a doctorate in political science at the Graduate Institute of International Studies, Geneva, in 1934. His dissertation was about military personnel in Africa (Reservoirs of men, a history of the black troops of French West Africa). Thomas E. Dewey Shelby joined the staff of District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey as an economist and research assistant. He advised Dewey during his presidential runs in 1940 and 1944 and was later appointed by then-New York Governor Dewey as First Deputy Superintendent of Insurance from 1944 to 1947. Business career Prior to his government service, Shelby had worked as a European correspondent for CBS Radio in Geneva. In 1941 he became a member of the New York Stock Exchange. 6 years later, with an investment of $100,000 he founded and headed Shelby Cullom Davis & Company, an investment firm, specializing in insurance securities. At the time of his death Shelby served as chairman. His son, Shelby Davis, formed Davis Selected Advisers in 1969 and by the 1980s had made the cut for Forbes Magazine's richest 400 Americans. Death Davis died at his home in Hobe Sound, Florida, aged 85, following a brief illness. He was survived by his wife of 44 years, Kathryn Wasserman Davis; two children Shelby M. C., of Manhattan; a daughter, Diana D. Spencer and eight grandchildren. Philanthropy He provided significant financial support to Princeton University (his alma mater) and also funded chairs at Wellesley College, and professorships of free enterprise at Wellesley and at the Cullom - Davis Library at Bradley University. A Professorship of International Security Studies at Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy was also instituted in his name. He also provided support to the Library and Museum of the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center in NYC. His generous support of the Society of Colonial Wars is recognized in part through the Shelby Cullom Davis Lecture. In December 2013 it was announced that through his charitable fund a $10 million donation was made to Colby College, Waterville, Maine. The Shelby Collum Davis Center for Historical Studies in the Department of History at Princeton University is named after Davis. The use of funds meant to endow the Shelby Cullum professorship at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut led in part to the resignation of that college's president James Jones, as well as media attention to the donor intent issue.\\"Another Cautionary Tale: The Shelby Cullom Davis Professorship of American Business and Economic Enterprise at Trinity College\\" in Neal, Anne D., and Michael B.

History  The term was introduced in a paper by A.L. Despotuli, A.V. Andreeva and B. Rambaby.  Characteristics  The rigid ion sublattice of AdSICs have structure channels where mobile ions of opposite sign migrate. Their ion- transport characteristics display ionic conductivity of ~0.3/Œ© cm (RbAg4I5, 300 K) and activation energy of Ei~0.1 eV. This determines the temperature- dependent concentration of mobile ions ni~Ni x eEi/kBT capable to migrate in conduction channels at each moment (Ni~1022/cm3, ni~2x1020/cm3, 300 K). The Rubidium silver iodide‚Äìfamily is a group of AdSIC compounds and solid solutions that are isostructural with the RbAg4I5 alpha modification.

Also known as the Lieberman‚ÄìWarner bill, bill number , the legislation was introduced by Sens. Joseph Lieberman (I-CT) and John Warner (R-VA) on October 18, 2007. The bill was approved by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works in December 2007, and was debated in the Senate during the week of June 2. The bill would create a national cap-and-trade scheme for greenhouse gas emissions, in which polluters would mostly be allocated right-to-emit credits based on how much greenhouse gas they currently emit. The cap would get tighter over time, until by 2050, emissions would be reduced to 63% below 2005 levels. Several environmental groups expressed their encouragement at the progress in legislation on the global warming issue while at the same time expressing disappointment that the bill did not reduce emissions enough. On June 6, 2008, the bill was killed by Senate Republicans over worries that it would damage the economy. Bill summary * Capping greenhouse emissions: The bill would impose emission limits on electric utility, transportation, and manufacturing industries.Stephanie I. Cohen, \\"Is the latest climate change bill getting warmer?,\\" The Washington Post, August 3, 2007. ** Between 2005 and 2012: The bill caps emissions at 5200 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent, the estimated levels during 2005.Daniel Lashof, \\"Global Warming Pollution Reductions under the Lieberman-Warner Bill,\\" (archive) Natural Resources Defense Council, October 16, 2007. ** Between 2012 and 2020: Further reductions of 2 percent per year should result in a 15% reduction below 2005 levels. ** Between 2020 and 2050: Emissions should be reduced by 70% by 2050. * Transition assistance: To smooth the way for companies and individuals, the Lieberman-Warner bill includes financial incentives for reducing emissions ** Low- and middle-income families: The legislation calls for $350 billion in assistance for low- and middle-income families though 2030.\\"Assessment of America‚Äôs Climate Security Act of 2007,\\" National Wildlife Federation, October 30, 2007. The money would come from programs such as the Low Income Weatherization Assistance Program. ** Modernization assistance: The legislation provides $500 billion through 2030 for investments in zero- and low-carbon technologies. Bill progress =Subcommittee passage= On November 5, 2007, the Subcommittee on Private Sector and Consumer Solutions approved the measure, and recommended it to the full Committee on Environment and Public Works. During the subcommittee hearing, Sen. Bernard Sanders tried unsuccessfully to modify substantial portions of the bill, with only one proposed amendment accepted. He had attempted to \\"strengthen the auction of pollution allocations, lower the cap on emissions, earmark subsidies for renewable energies, demand accountability from the auto industry, and diminish industry's capacity to stall simply by buying carbon offsets.\\" =Approval in Environment and Public Works Committee= Warner joined Democrats and Lieberman in approving the legislation on December 5, 2007, following a day of debate in the Environment and Public Works Committee.Frank Davies, \\"Major global warming bill headed for Senate\\", The Mercury News, December 6, 2007 According to one report, Republican Sens. Jim Inhofe (Okla.) and Larry Craig (Idaho) offered 150 amendments to the act.\\"Don't Say We Didn't Warner You\\", Grist, December 6, 2007 In addition, The Mercury News reported that opponents \\"failed to amend the bill with a provision that would end the emissions caps unless China ‚Äì about to become the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases ‚Äì adopted similar restrictions within 10 years.\\" Inhofe said the bill would cost 2.3 million jobs during the next 10 years.John M. Broder, \\"Senate Panel Passes Bill to Limit Greenhouse Gases\\", The Washington Post, December 6, 2007 The committee approved the legislation by an 11‚Äì8 vote. =On the Senate floor= On June 2, 2008, the bill's first day on the Senate floor, a cloture vote to override a possible filibuster passed 74‚Äì14. The remainder of the day was devoted to debating the start and length of the debate, for which Republicans wished to allot the maximum 30 hours before amendments could begin to be introduced.\\"Breaking: Cloture vote on Climate Security Act\\" , Grist News, June 2, 2008 The days before the vote had been marked by parliamentary maneuvers and bitter accusations over divergent estimates of the bill's future costs. On June 4, a group of GOP senators asked that the clerk of the Senate read the entire 491-page bill aloud, an extremely rare request. That took more than 10 hours. On June 6, 2008, the bill, which had bipartisan support, fell a dozen votes short of the 60-vote threshold it needed to overcome a GOP filibuster and move to final consideration. The 48‚Äì36 vote for the climate bill came after bitter debate in which opponents charged that it would damage the U.S. economy and drive up gasoline and other energy prices. Democratic supporters of the measure accused Republicans of spreading misinformation about it. The legislation collapsed for a variety of reasons, not the least of which was the poor timing of debating a bill predicted to increase energy costs while much of the country is focused on $4-a-gallon gas. On top of that, a number of industrial state Democrats like Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio were uncomfortable with the strong emissions caps that would have created a new regime of regulations for coal, auto and other manufacturing industries. Republicans, for the most part, held firm against a bill they said would cost billions in regulations while pushing the cost of gas higher. Seven Republicans, mostly moderates, voted for the procedural motion on the legislation while four Democrats voted against it. Amendments Amendments sponsored by Republican Sen. Bob Corker (Tenn.) address two common criticisms of the Climate Security Act: that it fails to include a way to offset increased costs for American citizens, and that it allows for the use of carbon offsets.\\"Corker Announces Amendments to Climate Security Legislation\\" (May 28, 2008). Corker.senate.gov. Retrieved 2016-11-30. Reaction An October 25, 2007 editorial in the Los Angeles Times stated, \\"Cap-and-trade is... an extremely complex mechanism that presents irresistible opportunities for cheating and profiteering that would deeply compromise its effectiveness... Congress should be focusing on simple carbon taxes that would assess polluters for the cost of their environmental damage and offset the resulting economic loss by lowering other taxes... Currently, about a quarter of the credits would be auctioned and the rest given away. Passing out free carbon allowances that are potentially worth billions of dollars makes it almost inevitable that politicians will unfairly divvy up the spoils among their supporters. If credits are allocated based on historical emissions, those who have polluted the most in the past end up being rewarded while green projects get little or nothing. All the credits should instead be auctioned, thus leveling the playing field...\\" Cap-and-trade bill is second-rate, Los Angeles Times, October 25, 2007 On January 8, 2008, the Washington Post editorialized, \\"The Lieberman-Warner measure, an amalgamation of several other climate-change bills worked on in the Senate last year, deserves a vigorous debate. The implications it would have for the economy and the American people demand it. Such a discussion, combined with the action and debate over the House‚ÄìSenate energy bill signed by President Bush last month, would demonstrate a level of urgency and engagement in Congress that has not been matched at the White House. The president's thinking on global warming has evolved over time, but he still balks at legally binding limits on carbon dioxide emissions, either through international agreements or the Lieberman- Warner bill. That shouldn't stop Congress from pushing ahead with legislation that would signal that the United States is ready to be an active part of the response to climate change.\\" Congress and Climate Change, Washington Post, January 8, 2008 In a June 1 article in the Washington Post, CEO of Duke Energy, Jim Rogers, stated \\"This is just a money grab. Only the mafia could create an organization that would skim money off the top the way this legislation would skim money off the top.\\"\\"Climate Bill Underlines Obstacles to Capping Greenhouse Gases\\", Washington Post, June 1, 2008 Some groups and lawmakers remained skeptical that the bill would do enough to curb emissions. A representative of the Union of Concerned Scientists said the bill was a \\"strong foundation\\" but, expressed a desire for tougher measures: > If we are to have a fighting chance to avoid the worst effects of climate > change, the United States has to cut emissions by 80 percent from current > levels by the middle of the century. President Bush issued a statement on June 2 pledging to veto the bill, stating that it is too strong, and \\"potentially a mere floor\\" for carbon emissions reductions.\\"Statement of Administration Policy\\" , White House Office of Management and Budget, June 2, 2008 On CNN on June 3, Van Jones, green jobs advocate, represented the environmental community's stance on the bill, saying \\"We like it, but we don't love it...it underestimates the inventiveness and innovation of the American people\\"\\"No Love Affair with Lieberman-Warner: Van Jones Speaks Out\\" , SolveClimate.com, June 3, 2008 Economic impact The Energy Information Administration forecasts real Gross Domestic Product to be between 0 and 1% lower in 2030 as compared with the reference scenario.\\"Energy Market and Economic Impacts of S. 2191, the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act of 2007\\", April, 2008\\"Climate plan leaves economy unharmed\\" , Connecticut Post, May 1st, 2008  References   External links  * The Senate vote on climate change shows progress for future (The Orlando Sentinel).

The notion of particle size applies to colloidal particles, particles in ecology, particles present in granular material (whether airborne or not), and particles that form a granular material (see also grain size). Measuring particle size There are several methods for measuring particle size and particle size distribution. Some of them are based on light, other on ultrasoundDukhin, A. S. and Goetz, P. J. Characterization of liquids, nano- and micro- particulates and porous bodies using Ultrasound, Elsevier, 2017 , or electric field, or gravity, or centrifugation. The use of sieves is a common measurement technique, however this process can be more susceptible to human error and is time consuming. Technology such as dynamic image analysis (DIA) can make particle size distribution analyses much easier. This approach can be seen in instruments like Retsch Technology's CAMSIZER or the Sympatec QICPIC series of instruments. They still lack the capability of inline measurements for real time monitoring in production environments. Therefore, inlie imaging devices like the SOPAT system are most efficient. In all methods the size is an indirect measure, obtained by a model that transforms, in abstract way, the real particle shape into a simple and standardized shape, like a sphere (the most usual) or a cuboid (when minimum bounding box is used), where the size parameter (ex. diameter of sphere) makes sense. Exception is the mathematical morphology approach, where no shape hypothesis is necessary. Definition of the particle size for an ensemble (collection) of particles presents another problem. Real systems are practically always polydisperse, which means that the particles in an ensemble have different sizes. The notion of particle size distribution reflects this polydispersity. There is often a need for a certain average particle size for the ensemble of particles. =Expressions for sphere size= The particle size of a spherical object can be unambiguously and quantitatively defined by its diameter. However, a typical material object is likely to be irregular in shape and non- spherical. The above quantitative definition of particle size cannot be applied to non-spherical particles. There are several ways of extending the above quantitative definition to apply to non-spherical particles. Existing definitions are based on replacing a given particle with an imaginary sphere that has one of the properties identical with the particle. ;Volume-based particle size: Volume-based particle size equals the diameter of the sphere that has the same volume as a given particle. Typically used in sieve analysis, as shape hypothesis (sieve's mesh size as the sphere diameter). :D = 2 \\\\sqrt[3] {\\\\frac{3V}{4\\\\pi}} :where ::D: diameter of representative sphere ::V: volume of particle ;Area-based particle size: Area-based particle size equals the diameter of the sphere that has the same surface area as a given particle. Typically used in optical granulometry techniques. :D = \\\\sqrt[2] {\\\\frac{4A}{\\\\pi}} :where ::D: diameter of representative sphere ::A: surface area of particle = Indirect measure expressions = In some measures the size (a length dimension in the expression) can't be obtained, only calculated as a function of another dimensions and parameters. Illustrating below by the main cases. ;Weight-based (spheroidal) particle size: Weight-based particle size equals the diameter of the sphere that has the same weight as a given particle. Useful as hypothesis in centrifugation and decantation, or when the number of particles can be estimated (to obtain average particle's weight as sample weight divided by the number of particles in the sample).

When a particle becomes that small, the thickness of the interface layer becomes comparable with the particle size. As a result, the position of the particle surface becomes uncertain.

At Minerva 93 Berlin he played as a senior player in the midfield. He graduated at the German sport academy and took the examination as a sports teacher. The then German national manager Otto Nerz discovered his ability for team leading and managing and connected him to Eintracht Frankfurt in 1928. =Manager career before World War II, 1928‚Äì41= With Eintracht Frankfurt the young manager won the Southern Germany championship in 1930 and 1932, each one after Eintracht won the district championship of Main/Hessen. In 1930 his team left SpVgg F√ºrth back on the second position ‚Äì in 1931 the Franks secured the title ‚Äì and in 1932 Frankfurt reclaimed the title and won the final match in the South against Bayern Munich with 2‚Äì0. Three times in a row Paul O√üwald led the Eagles to the final round of the German championship . In 1930 Eintracht lost to Holstein Kiel and in 1931 to Hamburger SV. In 1932, at the third try, the squad headed by the German internationals Rudolf Gramlich, Hugo Mantel, Franz Sch√ºtz and Hans Stubb succeeded against Allenstein, Tennis Borussia Berlin and FC Schalke 04 and subsequently reached the final match. On 2 June 1932 they had to face the runner-up of the South, Bayern Munich, in Nuremberg an. Bayern's internationals ‚Äì Ludwig Goldbrunner, Sigmund Haringer, Konrad Heidkamp and Oskar Rohr ‚Äì turned the table of the Southern Germany's final fixture and won 2‚Äì0 the German championship. After a break from 1933 until 1935 ‚Äì O√üwald assisted Reichstrainer Otto Nerz at the 1934 FIFA World Cup in Italy, and managed FSV Mainz 05 and the Gauauswahl S√ºdwest (South Western XI). As manager of the Gauauswahl S√ºdwest he won against Bavaria XI on 29 July 1934 in Nuremberg with 5‚Äì3. In 1935‚Äì36 he led the South Western squad to the finals against Saxonia. In 1935 he overtook again the management at SGE and stayed until 1938. In the 1937‚Äì38 season Eintracht won the championship of the Gauliga S√ºdwest and let Borussia Neunkirchen, Wormatia Worms and Kickers Offenbach behind. In the group matches of the final round to the German championship the Eagles did not advance due to the worse goal difference. After the season Paul O√üwald was appointed to the head of the municipal office for sports Frankenthal and had to abandon his at occupation at Frankfurt. Until 1941 he managed VfR Frankenthal as well. =Kickers Offenbach, 1946‚Äì58= After World War II the former Wehrmacht officer started to work for Kickers Offenbach. He was a football teacher, strict father figure and commanded respect. In twelve he led Kickers to the top of the Oberliga. Twice (in 1949 and 1955) he won the Southern German championship. In 1950 and 1957 he entered for the third and fourth time final round for the German championship. He could win the championship of the Oberliga S√ºd in 1948‚Äì49 with a difference of eleven points to runner-up VfR Mannheim. Mannheim took revenge and beat Offenbach in the final round with 2‚Äì1 and eventually won in the final match against Borussia Dortmund the 1949 German championship. In 1950 the O√üwald team finished third in the South, endured the final round but lost the Southern runner-up VfB Stuttgart in the final match when VfB won 2‚Äì1 against Offenbach. Horst Buhtz, Gerhard Kaufhold, Willi Keim and Kurt Schreiner were part of this team then. In the final group matches in 1955 and 1957 Kickers failed advance against the respective later champions Rot-Weiss Essen and Borussia Dortmund. In these years he contributed the players Engelbert Kraus, Hermann Nuber and Helmut Preisend√∂rfer to Kickers. After his twelfth season he bid farewell after 1957‚Äì58. Paul O√üwald was described as perfectionist who had the view for the talent and the shaping of youth players. The football teacher was not afraid of visiting village and eye talents and sign them in their parents' house. As manager of Kickers he took care of the Under-19 section as well. He set value on travels abroad against foreign clubs: \\"In international matches you learn the most\\". 1968‚Äì69 managed OFC in the Bundesliga for another season but could not avoid Offenbach's relegation and resigned due for health reason on 16 November 1969. =Eintracht Frankfurt, 1958‚Äì1964= In the summer of 1958 Paul O√üwald crossed the Main and signed at Frankfurt for the third time. At first go he won the Southern German championship with the SGE. In the final round they overcame Werder Bremen, 1. FC K√∂ln and FK Pirmasens. In eight final round matches Eintracht won them all. In the final fixture Frankfurt the former O√üwald club Offenbach on 28 June 1959 in Berlin and won 5‚Äì3 after overtime. The match was called O√üwald derby because the two teams in Berlin played a similar style, the O√üwald style. The offence quality with Kre√ü, Sztani, Feigenspan, Lindner and Pfaff succeeded after overtime. In European Cup 1959-60 the motivator led the team as the first German squad to a European final after beating BSC Young Boys, Wiener Sportclub and Rangers. On 18 May 1960 Real Madrid with their stars Ferenc Pusk√°s (four goals) and Alfredo di St√©fano (three goals) beat Frankfurt at Hampden Park with 7‚Äì3. In the 1961 and 1962 campaigns Eintracht entered the final rounds for the German championship again. In the first season of the Bundesliga Paul O√üwald managed Eintracht but later two heart attacks led to his resignation on 17 April 1964.  Other football associations  Paul O√üwald was co-founder and the first chairman (1957‚Äì63) of the Association of German Football Teachers (Bund Deutscher Fu√üball-Lehrer). Later he was announced as the honoured chairman. In 1967 German Football Association established a contact point for managers and player to be placed in a club to prevent illegal agents. Paul O√üwald led this contact point, located in DAG-Haus in Frankfurt on Bockenheimer Landstra√üe and was supported by the Association of German football teachers and the German Salaried Employees' Union. In November 1993 the manager legend died in Sachsenhausen.

Crafting a Cloning Policy: From Dolly to Stem Cells. Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press. Life and career Seed was born in Chicago and graduated from Oak Park and River Forest High School in Illinois before attending Harvard University, earning his undergraduate degree there in 1949.Staff report (September 14, 1998). Seed Proposes Cloning Himself Harvard Crimson He later received a master's degree, as well as a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard in 1953. His interests soon shifted to the new frontier of biomedicine. In the 1970s Seed co-founded a company that commercialized a technique for transferring embryos in cattle. Later, he and his brother, Chicago surgeon Randolph Seed, started another company, Fertility & Genetics Research Inc., to help infertile women conceive children using the same technique.Evans, Debra (2000). Without Moral Limits: Women, Reproduction, and Medical Technology. Crossway, These efforts to transplant a human embryo from one woman to an infertile surrogate mother were published in 1984. The cumbersome procedure involved flushing embryos out of the uterus of the egg donor‚Äîand was soon eclipsed by in-vitro fertilization. Ultimately the venture failed. On December 5, 1997, Seed announced that he planned to clone a human being before any federal laws could be enacted to ban the process. Seed's announcement added fuel to the raging ethical debate on human cloning that had been sparked by Ian Wilmut's creation of Dolly the sheep, the first clone obtained from adult cells. Seed's plans were to use the same technique used by the Scottish team. Seed's announcement went against President Clinton's 1997 proposal for a voluntary private moratorium against human cloning. In the media frenzy that followed, the story of a 69-year-old eccentric, and maverick scientist emerged, but Seed possessed impressive credentials and was not dismissed immediately. While virtually no mainstream scientist believed Seed would succeed, there began a subtle shift in attitudes after Seed made his announcement.Merrill, Richard A.; Rose, Bryan J. FDA Regulation of Human Cloning: Usurpation or Statesmanship; 15 Harv. J. L. Tech 85: (2001-2002) Retired at the time of his announcement to clone the first human, Seed was reported to have dabbled in ill-fated ventures in the past. He claimed at one time to have commitments for $800,000 toward a goal of $2.5 million needed to clone the first human before 2000. Seed first said that he was going to make little baby clones for infertile couples. Later, \\"to defuse criticism that I'm taking advantage of desperate women,\\" he announced that he would first clone himself. Still later he announced that he would re-create his wife Gloria. \\"God made man in his own image,\\" he told National Public Radio correspondent Joe Palca in December 1997. \\"God intended for man to become one with God. Cloning, is the first serious step in becoming one with God.\\" In a later interview on CNN, Seed elaborated: \\"Man,\\" he said, \\"will develop the technology and the science and the capability to have an indefinite life span.\\" Seed was awarded the 1998 Ig Nobel Prize in economics,https://www.improbable.com/ig-about/winners/#ig1998 and a performance titled The Seedy Opera debuted at the event.Wickramasekara, Sagara (October 5, 1999).

Listed at , 173 lb., Thomas batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He was born in Camp Point, Illinois. Biography The Red Sox signed Thomas in 1911 but allowed him to play the 1911 season with the Sacramento Sacts before recalling him to the Major Leagues for the 1912 season. He spent the 1912 season as a little-used backup catcher for 1912 World Series championship Red Sox. A fine defensive replacement, Thomas was the primary catcher for the Red Sox during three years, helping them to the World Championship in 1915 and 1916. He caught two no-hitters for the Red Sox in 1916, one for Rube Foster on June 21 and another for Dutch Leonard on August 30. On June 23, 1917, Thomas was involved in a combined no-hitter in which he and Babe Ruth were both ejected after disagreement over the strike zone after Ruth walked the first batter. Ernie Shore and Sam Agnew replaced Ruth and Thomas respectively and promptly caught the walked batter at second and recorded 26 consecutive outs. In 1917 he led American League catchers with a .986 fielding percentage, but at the end of the season he was dealt to the Philadelphia Athletics, with two other players, in the same transaction that brought Joe Bush, Wally Schang and Amos Strunk to Boston. He did not appear in a game for the Athletics and was sold to the Indians. While in Cleveland, he won a third World Series ring in 1920. A good pinch-hitter as well, he hit .417 (13-for-31) from 1913 to 1918. In a 10-season career, Thomas was a .237 hitter (245-for-1035) with two home runs and 102 RBI, including 88 runs, 27 doubles, eight triples, 12 stolen bases, and a .318 on-base percentage. In 423 catching appearances, he committed 52 errors in 1,948 chances for a .973 fielding percentage. He appeared as himself in the Paramount feature film Warming Up. Thomas died in Modesto, California at age 65.

He was a prominent member, together with Allan Monkhouse and Stanley Houghton, of a group known as the Manchester School of dramatists. Early life Harold Brighouse was born in Eccles, Lancashire, the eldest child of John Southworth Brighouse, a manager in a cotton-spinning firm, and Charlotte Amelia n√©e Harrison, a headmistress. Harold went to a local school, then won a scholarship to Manchester Grammar School. He left school aged 17 and started work as a textile buyer in a shipping merchant's office. In 1902 he went to London to set up an office for his firm. There he met Emily Lynes and married her in Lillington, Leamington Spa in 1907. He was promoted at work and returned to Manchester, but in 1908 he became a full-time writer. () Writing career The first play written by Brighouse was Lonesome Like, but the first to be produced was The Doorway. This was performed in 1909 at Annie Horniman's Gaiety Theatre in Manchester and produced by Ben Iden Payne. Horniman and Payne gave strong support to Brighouse in the early stages of his career. Many of his plays were one-act pieces; three of the best of these (The Northerners, Zack and The Game) were published together as Three Lancashire Plays in 1920. All of these plays were set in Lancashire but Brighouse also wrote plays of a different type, such as The Oak Settle and Maid of France. His most successful play was Hobson's Choice, first produced in 1915 in New York where Payne was working. It was first produced in England in 1916 at the Apollo Theatre, London, where it ran for 246 performances. The play was made into a film, directed by David Lean, in 1953, and it was produced at the National Theatre at the Old Vic, London, in 1964. The Crucible Theatre Sheffield staged a revival in June 2011 directed by Christopher Luscombe and starring Barrie Rutter, Zoe Waites and Philip McGinley. Brighouse also wrote novels, including Hepplestalls, concerning a Lancashire mill-owning family in the 19th century. In addition he wrote many reviews and other pieces for the Manchester Guardian. He was a member of the Dramatists' Club and in 1930‚Äì31 was chairman of the Society of Authors' dramatic committee. After 1931 he wrote no more full-length plays. His autobiography What I Have Had was published in 1953. Other activities and later life In the First World War, Brighouse was declared unfit for combat, but joined what later became the Royal Air Force, and was seconded to the Air Ministry Intelligence Staff, where in his spare time he wrote Hobson's Choice. In 1919 he moved to Hampstead, London. In 1958 he collapsed in the Strand and died the following day in Charing Cross Hospital. His estate amounted to just under ¬£14,500.

Biography Soderman joined the Army from his birth city of West Haven, Connecticut in August 1943,WWII Army Enlistment Records and by December 17, 1944 was serving as a private first class in Company K, 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division. On that day, near Rocherath, Belgium, Soderman used his bazooka to single-handedly disable three German tanks and attack an infantry platoon. Although seriously wounded, he survived the battle and was awarded the Medal of Honor eleven months later, on November 1, 1945. Soderman left the Army while still a private first class. He married the late Virginia Rae Leake and had two children, Peter William Soderman, currently a resident of Mexico, and the late Susan Louise Soderman. He was proud of a long career working at the VA hospital in West Haven. He died at age 68 and was buried at Oak Grove Cemetery in his hometown of West Haven, Connecticut. Medal of Honor citation Pfc William A. Soderman receives the MOH on the White House lawn, 12 October 1945 Private First Class Soderman's official Medal of Honor citation reads: > Armed with a bazooka, he defended a key road junction near Rocherath, > Belgium, on 17 December 1944, during the German Ardennes counteroffensive. > After a heavy artillery barrage had wounded and forced the withdrawal of his > assistant, he heard enemy tanks approaching the position where he calmly > waited in the gathering darkness of early evening until the 5 Mark V tanks > which made up the hostile force were within pointblank range. He then stood > up, completely disregarding the firepower that could be brought to bear upon > him, and launched a rocket into the lead tank, setting it afire and forcing > its crew to abandon it as the other tanks pressed on before Pfc. Soderman > could reload. The daring bazookaman remained at his post all night under > severe artillery, mortar, and machinegun fire, awaiting the next onslaught, > which was made shortly after dawn by 5 more tanks. Running along a ditch to > meet them, he reached an advantageous point and there leaped to the road in > full view of the tank gunners, deliberately aimed his weapon and disabled > the lead tank. The other vehicles, thwarted by a deep ditch in their attempt > to go around the crippled machine, withdrew. While returning to his post > Pfc. Soderman, braving heavy fire to attack an enemy infantry platoon from > close range, killed at least 3 Germans and wounded several others with a > round from his bazooka. By this time, enemy pressure had made Company K's > position untenable. Orders were issued for withdrawal to an assembly area, > where Pfc. Soderman was located when he once more heard enemy tanks > approaching. Knowing that elements of the company had not completed their > disengaging maneuver and were consequently extremely vulnerable to an > armored attack, he hurried from his comparatively safe position to meet the > tanks. Once more he disabled the lead tank with a single rocket, his last; > but before he could reach cover, machinegun bullets from the tank ripped > into his right shoulder. Unarmed and seriously wounded he dragged himself > along a ditch to the American lines and was evacuated. Through his > unfaltering courage against overwhelming odds, Pfc.

She was the first steamship-of-war in the Texas Navy.The U.S. Navy fielded the steam batteries Fulton and Fulton II before 1839. Navy Historical Center, http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh- usn/usnsh-f/fulton.htm (access date 10/15/10) Background of the Texas Navy The Texas Navy was officially formed in January 1836, with the purchase of four schooners: , , , and . These ships, under the command of Commodore Charles Hawkins, helped Texas win independence by preventing a Mexican blockade of the Texas coast, seizing Mexican ships carrying reinforcements and supplies to its army, and sending their cargoes to the Texas volunteer army. Nevertheless, Mexico refused to recognize Texas as an independent country. By the middle of 1837, all of the ships had been lost at sea, run aground, captured, or sold. With no ships to impede a possible invasion by Mexico, Texas was vulnerable to attack. In 1838, President Mirabeau B. Lamar responded to this threat by forming a second Texas Navy. Unlike Sam Houston, Lamar was an ardent supporter of the Texas Navy and saw the urgent need for its continuation. The second Texas Navy was placed under the command of Commodore Edwin Ward Moore, an Alexandria Academy graduate who was recruited from the United States Navy. One of the ships of this second navy was the Zavala. History of Zavala Pennant of the Zavala Zavala was built in 1836 as a passenger steamship named the Charleston serving the Philadelphia-Charleston route. In 1838, when Lamar began rebuilding the Texan fleet, the navy purchased Charleston for $120,000 and renamed it Zavala in honor of Lorenzo de Zavala, the first vice president of the Republic of Texas. On 10 May 1839, Zavala assisted in the refloating of the , which had run aground at Galveston. Captain A. C. Hinton was her first commander in the Texas Navy. Capt. John T. K. Lothrop took command of Zavala on 4 March 1840 and led her on her only campaign. After the successful Texas revolt, other parts of Mexico had rebelled against the regime of Santa Anna, including the Yucatan peninsula. President Lamar was determined to assist the rebels in their struggle with Mexico City. So, on 24 June 1840, Zavala accompanied by Commodore Moore's flagship, the sloop-of-war Austin, and three armed schooners, slipped out of Galveston Bay and turned south across the Gulf to the Bay of Campeche near the Yucatan Peninsula. During the cruise off the Yucatan, Zavala never engaged the enemy directly, but she proved invaluable in the only action that the flotilla saw. On 20 November 1840, the steamship towed Moore's flagship, Austin and the schooner San Bernard up the San Juan Bautista River to Villahermosa, the seat of government control in the state of Tabasco. The squadron had made a deal with federalist rebels to drive the centralistas out for $25,000, the first $10,000 to be paid up front. The federalists agreed.Jonathan W. Jordan, Lone Star Navy: Texas, the Fight for the Gulf of Mexico, and the Shaping of the American West (Potomac Books 2007), 172. Soon the small flotilla pointed their guns at the city and then sent troops into the seemingly deserted capital. Commodore Moore encountered a man bearing a white flag on a tree branch, and when he ascertained that this was the mayor, the Texas commodore demanded $25,000 or he would level the town. The mayor asked if silver would be acceptable, and upon receiving an affirmative reply, delivered the ransom. The commodore set sail with his booty and used the money to repair and outfit his ships. Return to Galveston and the end Returning to her homeport in Galveston, Zavala encountered a terrible storm and ran out of coal, forcing the crew to burn anything they could put their hands on to avoid losing her in the storm. Badly damaged, Zavala was laid up in Galveston harbor awaiting repairs, which due to the state of the Republic's finances were not forthcoming. With the election of Sam Houston in 1841, the navy was no longer a priority and Zavala was allowed to deteriorate. In May 1842, she was in such poor condition that Zavala was eventually scuttled to prevent her sinking. The wreck Clive Cussler, founder of the National Underwater and Marine Agency, located the hull of Zavala (archaeological site 41GV95) beneath a parking lot in the former Bean's Wharf area of the harbor in 1986. In Clive Cussler's NUMA Files series of adventure novels, one of the main characters is named Jose 'Joe' Zavala after the ship.

Known as Alex Evans in the United Kingdom, he coached Wales at the 1995 Rugby World Cup. He was assistant coach of Australia on the 1984 Grand Slam tour. Evans was a representative player for Queensland for more than a decade, and the Alec Evans Medal is now awarded annually for the Queensland Premier Rugby player of the year. Playing career Evans played for Queensland over 11 consecutive seasons from 1959 to 1969, including as captain, and in 1973 at the age of 34. Going from Souths first grade into the Queensland line-up in 1959 at age 20, Evans played a total of 62 games for his State. This record was unsurpassed until Queensland started playing teams from outside of Australia on a regular basis. He won Wallabies selection when picked to tour New Zealand in 1962, but contracted glandular fever and did not get to play a game. A tough and loyal player, Evans left the field with a dislocated shoulder in the 1965 match against South Africa in Brisbane, only to return to finish it moments later with his arm strapped to his side. Coaching On retiring from playing, he became a coach of international renown. As a coach he was credited as being the unsung hero of the 1984 Grand Slam Wallabies tour of the UK, the first Wallabies side to return with victories over all four home nations. Evans, although having a Welsh name, later became the first non- Welshman to coach Wales. While head coach at Cardiff RFC, Evans was appointed caretaker coach of Wales in 1995 following the departure of Alan Davies, but he couldn't avoid the elimination of Wales at the 1st round of the 1995 Rugby World Cup finals. Following his coaching days at Cardiff RFC, Evans coached Gordon RFC in Sydney's Shute Shield before joining the Queensland Reds as Scrum Technical Advisor. In 2007, he joined the Australian coaching team as technical advisor in preparation for their 2007 Rugby World Cup campaign. He coached three Queensland clubs to Hospital Cup premierships (Wests, Souths, Gold Coast Breakers), as well as being in constant demand as a mentor for any number of school and club sides. Evans finished his career as an assistant coach to Queensland's Super Rugby winning team of 2011.

In 1986 he successfully ran for the Illinois House of Representatives, winning the 94th District seat. After serving three full terms, he moved into the judicial field as a judge in the 9th judicial circuit. Hultgren retired on July 4, 2006. He has spent his retirement volunteering for a variety of conservation organizations and groups. Early life and education Hultgren was born at the Hammond Henry Hospital in Geneseo, Illinois, to parents Rodger and Marietta. He was the second of three sons. He was baptized on Easter Sunday of April, 1952. During his adolescence he became very interested in the outdoors. This intrigue was due in large part to his neighbor, who was highly knowledgeable about nature, specifically birding and gardening. Also important in the development of his affection for the outdoors was his maternal grandfather, who sparked his interest in fishing. Hultgren, however, due to his love of plants and animals, refused to go hunting with his grandfather. Hultgren attended both the Cambridge Community Grade School and Cambridge High School. His leadership and political aspirations became evident through his extra-curricular activities in high school, where he was nicknamed \\"Senator.\\" His freshman year he was voted as the class president. He was highly active in Teenage Republicans throughout high school, both locally and statewide. He was the first treasurer of the Henry Country TARS chapter and the second treasurer of the Illinois TARS federation. Also while in high school, Hultgren was active on the Yearbook Club and the Student Council, serving as the Student Council president his senior year. During his junior and senior years he was a member of the National Honor Society. Other organizations which he was active with were the Library Club and Future Teachers. As a senior, he was voted by his classmates as \\"Most Likely to Succeed\\" and \\"Most Studious.\\" He graduated a salutatorian in 1969. He went to Augustana College and continued his strong participation in extra-curricular activities. He was president of the College Republicans at Augustana and was also involved with the Student Judiciary Committee and the school newspaper. During the fall of 1971 Hultgren represented the college as a member of American University's Washington Semester Honors Program in the nation's capitol. He received his Bachelor of Arts degrees in both economics and political science in 1973. He graduated cum laude. He was the fourth generation to attend Augustana, but the first to graduate. While studying there, he was a part of Pi Upsilon Gamma, a local fraternity. This fraternity has since been disbanded at the college. Hultgren proceeded to work as a budget analyst for a credit card processing company in Raleigh, North Carolina for two years. In the fall of 1975, he began graduate work at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In 1978 he graduated with academic honor and received his Doctor of Jurisprudence degree. Career David Hultgren took and passed the Bar examination in 1978, and proceeded to acquire a job at the law firm of Stansell, Critser, and Whitman in Monmouth, Illinois. At this time he also served as a law clerk for justice Albert Scott of the Illinois Appellate Court. Hultgren was elected into the Illinois General Assembly in 1986. He represented the Republican Party in the Illinois House of Representatives from 1987-1992.'Illinois Blue Book 1991-1992,' Biographical Sketch of David Hultgren, pg. 114 He replaced his close friend Carl Hawkinson, who decided to run for the senate. Hultgren was the spokesman for the Committee on Aging. He was also a member of numerous other committees, including: * Elementary and Secondary Education * Higher Education * Transportation and Motor Vehicles Hultgren chose to end his career in the legislature after three terms. Hoping that his skills could still be useful elsewhere, Hultgren chose to run for a circuit judge position. He won, and was sworn in on December 7, 1992. As a judge in the 9th judicial circuit, he held court in the following county seats: * Macomb * Carthage * Lewistown * Oquawka * Monmouth * Galesburg Although he presided in all of these cities, he served mainly in Monmouth (1992‚Äì1999) and Lewistown (1999‚Äì2006). While in Monmouth, he served as the president of the local area Chamber of Commerce, which ultimately led to him winning the Monmouth Area Chamber of Commerce \\"Man of the Year\\" in 1989. Upon his retirement in 2006, Hultgren was honored by having his portrait hung in the courthouse in Monmouth.

Function  This gene encodes a member of the Notch family. Members of this Type 1 transmembrane protein family share structural characteristics including an extracellular domain consisting of multiple epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats, and an intracellular domain consisting of multiple, different domain types. Notch family members play a role in a variety of developmental processes by controlling cell fate decisions. The Notch signaling network is an evolutionarily conserved intercellular signaling pathway that regulates interactions between physically adjacent cells. In Drosophila, notch interaction with its cell-bound ligands (delta, serrate) establishes an intercellular signaling pathway that plays a key role in development. Homologues of the notch-ligands have also been identified in humans, but precise interactions between these ligands and the human notch homologues remain to be determined. This protein is cleaved in the trans-Golgi network, and presented on the cell surface as a heterodimer. This protein functions as a receptor for membrane bound ligands, and may play multiple roles during development. A deficiency can be associated with bicuspid aortic valve. There is evidence that activated Notch 1 and Notch 3 promote differentiation of progenitor cells into astroglia. Notch 1, when activated before birth, induces radial glia differentiation, but postnatally induces the differentiation into astrocytes.

PAK1 is one of six members of the PAK family of serine/threonine kinases which are broadly divided into group I (PAK1, PAK2 and PAK3) and group II (PAK4, PAK6 and PAK5/7). The PAKs are evolutionarily conserved. PAK1 localizes in distinct sub-cellular domains in the cytoplasm and nucleus. PAK1 regulates cytoskeleton remodeling, phenotypic signaling and gene expression, and affects a wide variety of cellular processes such as directional motility, invasion, metastasis, growth, cell cycle progression, angiogenesis. PAK1-signaling dependent cellular functions regulate both physiologic and disease processes, including cancer, as PAK1 is widely overexpressed and hyperstimulated in human cancer, at-large.  Discovery  PAK1 was first discovered as an effector of the Rho GTPases in rat brain by Manser and colleagues in 1994. The human PAK1 was identified as a GTP- dependent interacting partner of Rac1 or Cdc42 in the cytosolic fraction from neutrophils, and its complementary DNA was cloned from a human placenta library by Martin and Colleagues in 1995.  Function  PAK proteins are critical effectors that link the Rho family of GTPases (Rho GTPases) to cytoskeleton reorganization and nuclear signaling. PAK proteins, a family of serine/threonine p21-activated kinases, include PAK1, PAK2, PAK3 and PAK4. These proteins serve as targets for the small GTP binding proteins Cdc42 and Rac and have been implicated in a wide range of biological activities. PAK1 regulates cell motility and morphology. Alternative transcripts of this gene have been found, but their full-length natures have not been determined. Stimulation of PAK1 activity is accompanied by a series of cellular processes that are fundamental to living systems. Being a nodular signaling molecule, PAK1 operates to converging station of a large number of signals triggered by proteins on the cell surface as well as upstream activators, and translates into specific phenotypes. At the biochemical level, these activities are regulated by the ability of PAK1 to phosphorylate its effector interacting substrates, which in-turn set-up a cascade of biochemical events cumulating into a cellular phenotypic response. In addition, PAK1 action is also influenced by its scaffolding activity. Examples of PAK1-regulated cellular processes include dynamic of actin and microtubule fibers, critical steps during cell cycle progression, motility and invasion, redox and energy metabolism, cell survival, angiogenesis, DNA-repair, hormone sensitivity, and gene expression. Functional implications of the PAK1 signaling are exemplified by its role in oncogenesis, viral pathogenesis, cardiovascular dysregulation, and neurological disorders.  Gene and spliced variants  The human PAK1 gene is 153-kb long and consists of 23 exons, six exons for 5‚Äô-UTR and 17 exons for protein coding (Gene from review). Alternative splicing of six exons generates 20 transcripts from 308-bp to 3.7-kb long; however, only 12 spliced transcripts have open reading frames and are predicted to code ten proteins and two polypeptides. The remaining 8 transcripts range are for non-coding long RNAs from 308-bp to 863-bp long. Unlike the human PAK1, murine PAK1 gene generates five transcripts: three protein-coding from 508-bp to 3.0-kb long, and two transcripts of about 900-bp for non-coding RNAs.  Protein domains  The core domains of the PAK family include a kinase domain in the C-terminal region, a p21-binding domain (PBD), and an auto-inhibitory domain (AID) in group I PAKs. Group I PAKs exist in an inactive, closed homodimer conformation wherein AID of one molecule binds to the kinase domain of another molecule, and activated in both GTPase-dependent and -independent manners.  Activation/inhibition  PAK1 contains an autoinhibitory domain that suppresses the catalytic activity of its kinase domain. PAK1 activators relieve this autoinhibition and initiate conformational rearrangements and autophosphorylation events leading to kinase activation. IPA-3 (1,1‚Ä≤-disulfanediyldinaphthalen-2-ol) is a small molecule allosteric inhibitor of PAK1. Preactivated PAK1 is resistant to IPA-3. Inhibition in live cells supports a critical role for PAK in PDGF-stimulated ERK activation. Reversible covalent binding of IPA-3 to the PAK1 regulatory domain prevents GTPase docking and the subsequent switch to a catalytically active state. PAK1 knockdown in prostate cancer cells is associated with reduced motility, reduced MMP9 secretion and increased TGFŒ≤ expression, which in these cases, is growth inhibitory. However, IPA-3's pharmacokinetic properties as well as undesirable redox effects in cells, due to the continuous reduction of the sulfhydryl moiety, make it unsuitable for clinical development. = Upstream activators = PAK1 activity is stimulated by a large number of upstream activators and signals, ranging from EGF, heregulin-beta 1, VEGF, basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, estrogen, lysophosphatidic acid, phosphoinositides, ETK, AKT, JAK2, ERK, casein kinase II, Rac3, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1, breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance 3, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-G protein-coupled receptor, ARG-binding protein 2Œ≥, hepatitis B virus X protein, STE20-related kinase adaptor protein Œ±, RhoI, Klotho, N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase V, B-Raf proto-oncogene, casein kinase 2-interacting protein 1, and filamin A. = Downstream effector targets = Functions of PAK1 are regulated by its ability to phosphorylate downstream effector substrates, scaffold activity, redistribution to distinct sub-cellular cellular sub-domains, stimulation or repression of expression of its genomic targets either directly or indirectly, or by all of these mechanisms. Representative PAK1 effector substrates in cancer cells include: Stathmin-S16, Merlin-S518, Vimentin-S25-S38-S50-S65-S72, Histone H3-S10, FilaminA-S2152, Estrogen receptor-alpha-S305, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5a-S779, C-terminal binding protein 1-S158, Raf1-S338, Arpc1b-T21, DLC1-S88, phosphoglucomutase 1-T466, SMART/HDAC1-associated repressor protein-S3486-T3568, Tubulin Cofactor B-S65-S128, Snail-S246 vascular endothelial-cadherin-S665, poly(RC) binding protein 1-T60-S246, integrin-linked kinase 1-T173-S246, epithelium-specific Ets transcription factor 1-S207, ErbB3 binding protein 1-T261, nuclear receptor-interacting factor 3-S28, SRC3-delta4-T56-S659-676, beta- catenin-S675, BAD-S111, BAD-S112,S136, MEK1-S298, CRKII-S41, MORC family CW- type zinc finger 2-S739, Paxillin-S258, and Paxillin-S273. = Genomic targets = PAK1 and/or PAK1-dependent signals modulate the expression of its genomic targets, including, vascular endothelial growth factor, Cyclin D1, phosphofructokinase-muscle isoform, nuclear factor of activated T-cell, Cyclin B1, Tissue Factor and tissue factor pathway inhibitor, Metalloproteinase 9, and fibronectin.

The tradition of music had been one of unified progression, even to the extent of Johannes Brahms' First Symphony being known as \\"Beethoven's Tenth\\". Beethoven's own three periods of composition are monolithic and united. Liszt's, by comparison, seem deconstructivist. Replacing pages which in Liszt's earlier compositions had been thick with notes and virtuoso passages was a starkness where every note and rest was carefully weighed and calculated, while the works themselves become more experimental harmonically and formally.Ogdon, 134-5. However, as with his earlier compositions, Liszt's later works continued to abound with forward-looking technical devices. Works such as Bagatelle sans tonalit√© (\\"Bagatelle without Tonality\\") foreshadow in intent, if not in exact manner, composers who would further explore the modern concept of atonality.Searle, Music, 115. Liszt's work also foreshadowed the impressionism that would characterize the work of Debussy and Ravel, as shown in Les Jeux d'Eaux √† la Villa d'Este (The Fountains of the Villa d'Este) from the third volume of Ann√©es de P√®lerinage. Another precursor of impressionism is Nuages gris, which won the admiration of both Debussy and Stravinsky. Technique =Economy of means= Compared to the creative abundance of earlier compositions, the music of Liszt's old age is unusually economic. Given barely enough notes to ensure their existence, his late pieces frequently lapse into monody, then silence. Sometimes a piece is open-ended, simply vanishing. This practice of \\"abandoning\\" a work in mid-air had been done previously by Fr√©d√©ric Chopin and Robert Schumann. Liszt's practice, however, is more radical. An example of this is in the Mephisto Polka, where the piece is simply deserted at the end, without explanation, dying out on a solitary F-natural.Walker, The Final Years, 442. Long passages are spun out on single notes and definite cadences are usually avoided, often leaving the overall tonality of pieces in doubt.Serle, New Grove, 11:38. A basic rhythmic unit, instead of becoming the foundation of an expansive Romantic melody, now becomes a stark end-product in itself. Throughout the late works, there is a freer, almost improvisatory use of melody, yet one derived from the tightest structural cells Liszt could conceive.Ogdon, 150. =Tonality= Liszt never lost interest in the question of tonality‚Äîa question which, for Liszt, was long standing. As early as 1832 he had attended a series of lectures given by F√©tis. From these lectures, Liszt derived the idea of an onde omnitonique, much like a Schoenbergian tone row, that would become a logical replacement for traditional tonality. For him such a row would be part of the historical process from a \\"unitonic\\" (tonality) moved to a \\"pluritonic\\" (polytonality) and ended in an \\"omnitonic\\" (atonality), where every note became a tonic. In his marginalia to Ramann's biography of him, made after he had turned 70, Liszt called the \\"omnitonic\\" an Endziel or final goal of the historical process. He also composed a \\"Pr√©lude omnitonique\\" to illustrate his theory. This piece was long considered lost but has recently been discovered.Walker, The Final Years, 439-40. Remaining lost, however, are the sketches for Liszt's treatise on modern harmony. Arthur Friedheim, a piano student of Liszt who became his personal secretary, wrote of seeing it among Liszt's papers at Weimar: > In his later years the Master had formed the habit of rising at five o'clock > in the morning, and I paid him many a solitary visit at that hour, even > playing to him occasionally. Jokingly, he would inquire whether I were still > up, or already up. On the last of these matutinal visits I found him poring > over books and old manuscripts. With his permission I joined him in this > very interesting occupation. Catching sight of one manuscript which > particularly drew my attention, I picked it up saying: \\"This will make you > responsible for a lot of nonsense which is bound to be written someday.\\" I > expected a rebuke for my remark, but he answered very seriously: \\"That may > be. I have not published it because the time for it is not yet ripe.\\" The > title of this little book was Sketches for a Harmony of the > Future.Friedheim, 161. The first two bars of Nuages Gris present the quartal harmony used in this piece. While the Sketches may have disappeared, Liszt left enough music from this period for listeners to surmise what that manuscript may have contained. Nuages gris is pointed out by several critics as a piece which could be heard as a gateway to modern music. One of its more intriguing features is its ending, which drifts off into keylessness and progresses to that point in a manner foretelling impressionism in music.Walker, The Final years, 440. Liszt was also one of the first composers to experiment with bitonality. One example occurs in the funeral march he wrote for L√°szl√≥ Teleky in his Historische ungarische Bildnisse (Historical Hungarian Portraits). This march is based on a four note ostinato based on the gypsy scale. The question of whether this ostinato is in G minor or B minor, and the resulting tonal ambiguity, remains unresolved.Walker, New Grove, 14:783. =Chord structure= Liszt became a pioneer in building new chords. Until the end of the 19th century the triad remained the prime architectural element in chordal structure. Few composers seemed to question whether chords built by other means were possible. One advance Liszt made was the use of minor and major chords struck together, a device he used in works such as the Cz√°rd√°s obstin√©e. Another advance was in building chords in intervals other than thirds. This meant dispensing altogether with the triad in its former place of supremacy.Walker, Man and Music, 359-60. A prime example of Liszt's experimenting is the pile-up of thirds in the vocal work Ossa arida, which he wrote in 1879. Inspired by the vision of Ezekiel (\\"O ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord\\"), Liszt depicts musically the raising up of the flesh from the dust by gathering up all the notes of the diatonic scale in a rising column, then sounding them simultaneously. There was no precedent to this approach and the piece retains a striking originality. A similar approach is the pile-up of fourths at the beginning of the Third Mephisto Waltz, written in 1883. At the climax of the piano piece Unstern! Liszt places two mutually exclusive chords against each other. Alan Walker quotes Peter Raabe as stating that the sounding of those two chords together is like a prisoner hammering on a wall, knowing full well that no one would hear him.Walker, New Grove, 14:782. =Harmony= Excerpt from the beginning of the Mephisto Waltz No. 1. Liszt's dispensing with the triad altogether as a basis for the harmonic aspect of music was well ahead of his time. Arnold Schoenberg started experimenting with building chords in fourths more than 30 years after Liszt had done so. People reportedly knowledgeable in music hailed Schoenberg's attempts at that time as \\"new.\\" However, Liszt had done the same not only in then-unpublished works such as the Third Mephisto Waltz but also in published ones such as the Hungarian Rhapsody No. 17.Walker, Man and Music, 360. Even in a popular work such as the Mephisto Waltz No. 1, the originality of its piling-up of fifths at its onset was remarkably forward for its time.Walker, Man and Music, 361. The augmented triads of Unstern! (written in 1885) had already appeared in the Faust Symphony; the bare parallel fifths of the Cz√°rd√°s macabre, as already mentioned, had helped the devil tune up in the Mephisto Waltz No. 1. However, Liszt makes more use in the late works of implied harmony, Chords hang unresolved, as at the close of Nuages Gris, and melodies are unaccompanied. Liszt's experimentation was accompanied by a bolder use of chromaticism in two forms‚Äîthat which originated from gypsy music as well as that of Romantic style, with its sinuous counterpoint and enharmonic ambiguities.Searle, New Grove, 11:50. =Scales and modes= Liszt's interest in unusual scales and modes increased greatly in his last years. This may have been a side benefit of his growing involvement in the political and musical destiny of Hungary as well as in nationalist music in general. He was led to explore or investigate in greater detail the scales of Hungarian and east European music. This exploration of a specifically Hungarian mode of expression would profoundly influence Bart√≥k. The whole-tone scale was another source of interest for Liszt.Ogdon, 150-51. A more complex picture In one sense, it can be tempting to think of the late pieces as an extension of Liszt's earlier works, as they exhibit a similar adventurousness harmonically, an intense chromaticism and a tonal ambiguity. What is new is the sadness of heart which pervades many of the late works. As tempting as it can be to think of Liszt as the father of modern music on the basis of his late music, looking at his achievements in these works as ends in themselves would be erroneous.Walker, The Final Years, 437. Liszt's technical achievements in his late music are one side of a more complex picture. Along with the increasing interest in Hungarian and other national schools of composition already mentioned, essential parts of this picture are tragedy in Liszt's personal life and developments in his friendship with Wagner.Ogdon, 135. Photograph of Liszt in the 1880s. In his later years Liszt's problems with health, both physical and mental, affected his ability to complete compositions. By the early 1880s, Liszt was often ravaged by a universal sadness, descending without warning and threatening to overwhelm everything he did. He told Lina Ramann, \\"I carry with me a deep sadness of the heart which must now and then break out in sound.\\"Walker, The Final Years, 437-38. In addition, the deaths of his son Daniel in 1859 and daughter Blandine in 1862 brought a phase of deep personal anguish that impacted greatly on his creative life. As he grew older, he was also deeply affected by the deaths of certain political figures, artists and personal acquaintances. These events, among others, triggered elegiac outpourings ranging from the unusual to the bizarre. Liszt was already known for drinking considerable amounts of alcohol with no detectable effects on his speech or piano playing; however, beginning in 1882, friends became concerned with the quality of the alcohol he consumed, which now included absinthe. It is very possible that alcohol both fed his depressive moods and limited his powers of concentration.Brown, 87-8. One point not normally discussed with Liszt but not unfamiliar to late-19th-century composers was his consciousness of working in the shadow of composers he considered giants. In Liszt's case, the shadows were those of Beethoven and Wagner. He professed to find consolation and inspiration in their works. However, it is also possible their greatness may have had an effect on his own ability to compose. While he blamed his inability to complete compositions on his busy social calendar as late as the early 1870s, by the late 1870s he began to express fears of failing creativity on his part. However, most critically, Liszt was not entirely deterred by his insecurities or growing awareness of waning powers. He continued working until a year before his death, by which time cataracts made composition virtually impossible.Brown, 88-9.Walker, The Final years, 500-501. Liszt wrestled daily with the demons of desolation, despair and death, bringing forth music that utterly failed to find its audience. We now know, in retrospect, that Liszt's contemporaries were offered a glimpse into a mind on the verge of catastrophe. They formed what Bence Szabolcsi calls \\"a conspiracy of silence\\" on the late pieces ‚Äî one not lifted until modern times.Walker, 'The Final Years, 438. Liszt's works from this period fall into three categories: *Music of retrospection *Music of despair *Music of death The first category contains pieces in which a troubled spirit seeks consolation in memories of the past. Liszt referred to this music as his \\"forgotten\\" pieces ‚Äî sardonically referring to compositions forgotten before even played, with titles such as Valse oubli√©e, Polka oubli√©e and Romance oubli√©e.Walker, Liszt: The Final Years, p. 438. The second category, music of despair, can appear much more important since the titles of the pieces in this category would seem to point to a troubled mind. These titles include: *Schlaflos! Frage und Antwort *Unstern! Sinistre, Disastro *Nuages gris *Ossa arida *Cs√°rd√°s macabre *Abschied These pieces, as well as others in this category, can be best understood as fragments broken off from a greater whole, each offering a glimpse of a pathology of despair. Though they do not share any overtly musical connections, they seem to fit with one another like members of a large family who never settle on one place yet become acquainted through chance encounters at smaller gatherings. The third category, music of death, contains pieces where Liszt raised grief to high art. Memorials, elegies, funerals and other aspects of the grieving process find their place in this music. Again, a sampling of titles in this grouping: *Funeral March for Emperor Maximilian *Seven Hungarian Historical Portraits #Sz√©chenyi Istv√°n (Lament) #E√∂tv√∂s J√¥zsef #V√∂r√∂smarty Mih√°ly #Teleki L√°szl√≥ (Funeral Music) #De√°k Ferenc #Pet√µfi S√°ndor (In Memory of) #Mosonyi Mih√°ly (Funeral Music) *Funeral Prelude and Funeral March *Elegy in Memory of Mme Mouchanoff *Und wir dachten der Toten (And We Thought of the Dead) Liszt once referred to his works in this category as his \\"mortuary pieces\\", perhaps as a joke intended to deflect criticism. As Walker puts it: \\"These pieces reveal a soul in turmoil. Since that is also a part of the human condition, there can be something here for all of us\\".Walker, Liszt: The Final Years, p. 439 Survey of works Liszt wrote approximately 100 individual works for solo piano, as well as many others for various vocal ensembles and couple of orchestral works, from 1869 to the end of his life. While some of these piano works are actually collections of pieces, the late pieces are almost entirely smaller works. Liszt had completed virtually all of his large-scale works, including the oratorio Christus; the only other large work he had planned, the oratorio St. Stanislaus, would remain unfinished at the time of his death, more than likely due to ill health rather than any mental incapacityWalker, The Final Years, 474. The late works of Franz Liszt can be grouped into six categories: =Music based on the works of others= While it is generally not recognized that Liszt continued writing transcriptions into his old age, this is actually by far the largest category of works he produced during this period. It numbers 35 items, two of which are collections (two sets of arrangements of songs by Robert and Clara Schumann.) Moreover, many of these works continue to employ the virtuoso style of his earlier career. One example of this is the R√©miniscences de Boccanegra, based on the Verdi opera and written in 1882.Baker, 99. Liszt's musical allegiances are clear from the pieces he chose to set. He continued to transcribe music by his son-in-law Richard Wagner and seemed equally fond of Italian music. He considered Camille Saint-Sa√´ns a musical ally, setting his Danse macabre in 1876; this work in turn may have influenced some of Liszt's later diabolic works, such as the Cs√°rd√°s macabre. He also championed Russian music of different styles and schools. These composers included Dargomyzhsky, Tchaikovsky, Anton Rubinstein and Cui. Liszt admired the Russians especially for challenging Germanic hegemony over matters of taste and style.Baker, 99, 102-3. One of the most striking of Liszt's late paraphrases is his setting of the Sarabande and Chaconne from Handel's opera Almira. This transcription was composed in 1879 for his English pupil Walter Bache, and it is the only setting of a baroque piece from Liszt's late period.Baker, 103. =Abstract compositions= This group of works is considerably smaller than the other groups, numbering only five works without any explicit programmatic information. Nearly every item dates from 1873 or earlier; the only exceptions are the final two of the Five Little Pieces, not published until 1963. Many of these pieces are also studies in advanced harmony. The Toccata, for instance, contrasts major versus minor and diatonic versus chromatic harmony.Baker, 103. One work in this category that should not be considered a late work is the Fantasy and Fugue on the Theme B-A-C-H. While it was composed in 1870 and published in 1871, it is written in his earlier style and is a type of work that he did not compose afterwards. It is based on Liszt's Prelude and Fugue on the Name B-A-C-H, written for organ in 1855-6 and revised in 1869-70. He arranged the revised organ work for piano and published it with a slightly different title.Baker, 106-7. =Nationalistic and celebratory work= This became an extremely important part of Liszt's compositional output. It consists of 29 works of a festive or patriotic character, 15 of which are associated specifically with Hungary, including the set of seven Hungarian Historical Portraits completed in 1885. Liszt was often called upon to write music for state occasions, producing three marches and the Sz√≥zat und Ungarischer Hymnus, a setting of the Hungarian national anthem noted for its use of unusual scales together with the juxtaposition of chromatically related harmonies.Baker, 107. Liszt stopped writing in the Hungarian style after 1873 but resumed doing so in 1881; this was the year he visited his birthplace, Raiding. Liszt discovered late in life that writing Hungarian music allowed him to experiment more freely, as though asserting his national identity provided the strength and sense of purpose to break away from the limitations of Western European music. For the first time he turned his attention to the cz√°rd√°s, a Hungarian folk dance. He may have also been influenced in this by Saint-Sa√´ns, whose Danse Macabre shares a similar use of parallel fifths to his Cz√°rd√°s macabre, composed in 1881-2. However, Liszt employs his musical material in this work with an extroverted vigor anticipating B√©la Bart√≥k. The same could be said of the second, third and fourth Mephisto Waltzes,Baker, 108-10. the second of which was dedicated to Saint-Sa√´ns. The three cz√°rd√°s that Liszt wrote‚Äîtitled Cz√°rd√°s, Cz√°rd√°s obstin√©e and Cz√°rd√°s macabre‚Äîare less freely treated than the Hungarian Rhapsodies and remain more specifically Hungarian than gypsy in thematic material. Their spare lines, angular rhythms and advanced harmonies show these pieces to be direct ancestors of Bart√≥k's work. Because of these attributes, the cz√°rd√°s are considered by Liszt scholars among the more interesting of the composer's late output.Howard, Dances, 3. The same, some critics argue, cannot be said as uniformly about his Hungarian Rhapsodies 16-19, composed after he had neglected the genre 30 years. Of these four late rhapsodies, only the last contains the variety, vivacity and sweep of the best of the earlier ones to make it effective in concert;Baker, 110. the others fail to become satisfactory pieces due to their fragmentary treatment.Searle, \\"Final\\", 73. The final rhapsody is based on themes from √Åbr√°nyi's Cs√°rd√°s nobles; the other three are based on original material. One potential pitfall in discussing these works is labeling them as atonal on the basis of hearing strange sonorities at the surface of the music. The Cz√°rd√°s macabre, for instance, is solidly based on compositional procedures consistent with Liszt's earlier style. The music focuses on variant forms of the mediant with concomitant contrast of sharp and flat key areas‚Äîin this case F major, F-sharp minor and G-flat major. =Sacred music= The sacred keyboard music is a small group of pieces, the most substantial of which were written mainly between 1877 and 1879. Several of these works are arranged from vocal music, including a piano solo arrangement of Via crucis, one of Liszt's most daring and original compositions.Baker, 110-12. Along with extended vocal works such as Via Crucis and Rosario, Liszt wrote 29 shorter choral works and a setting of Psalm 129.Pesce, 241-43. Via Crucis is perhaps the closest Liszt came to creating a new kind of church music through combining a new harmonic language with traditional liturgy. While the overall atmosphere is restrained and devout in feeling, the harmony underpinning the music is experimental, including an extensive use of the whole-tone scale.Searle, \\"Final\\", 77-8. While the composer uses familiar chorale and hymn tunes, the overall impression aurally is of an unsettled tonal language. Three of the 15 numbers (an introduction along with depictions of the 14 Stations of the Cross) employ sliding chromatic lines and harmonies; and when those harmonies do come to rest, they are often diminished or unique. Other Stations use successive chromatic chords and may abruptly end on a single tone.Pesce, 241. =Music of premonition, death and mourning= Liszt's works in this category make up a small but important collection of 13 individual works, including the two versions of La lugubre gondola. Some pieces from book III of Annees de Pelerinage could fit here, as could Via Crucis and the Historical Hungarian Portraits. Liszt was deeply affected by the deaths of friends and loved ones throughout his life; these losses, in turn, had a profound impact on the types of works Liszt would write. Like the sacred music, Liszt's works of premonition, death and mourning came from a deep inner impulse and he usually did not seek their publication. Many of these works are among his most unusual compositions, which stood in the way of their general accessibility.Baker, 113-13. =Programmatic music= Works in this category carry special, non-generic titles. They include the Four Mephisto Waltzes, the four Valses oubli√©es, and the orchestral and piano solo versions of the symphonic poem From the Cradle to the Grave. These works were written primarily after 1876, many of them after the pivotal year of 1881,Brown, 116. when Liszt fell down the stairs of the Hofg√§rtnerei in Weimar and his health took a precipitous slide.Walker, The Final years, 403. Contrary to the general reputation of Liszt's late works as gloomy and austere, the pieces in this category generally feature at least one of the attributes commonly associated with his earlier style‚Äîdiabolical energy, brilliant effects of vertiginous dancing, tender nostalgia and ardent passion.

From 1901-1902, he was a student at Cornell, Harvard, Ecole des Beaux Arts, Paris.Register of the Charles Wellington Furlong Papers, 1917-1963 He was the head of the Art Department at Cornell from 1896-1904. He was in North Africa, 1904-1905; Tierra del Fuego, 1907-1908; and Venezuela, 1910. In 1915 he was a member of an expedition to the West African islands for the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology (the Kitty A expedition). He was the first American to explore the Tripolitan Sahara. This experience led to his writing of The Gateway to the Sahara in 1909. Harper‚Äôs magazine funded him on a trip to South America around 1909. His article ‚ÄúThe Southernmost people of the world‚Äù came out of this trip. Even after the article was written he continued to travel and explore in South America. His world travels led to a decline in his overall health, in order to get better he traveled to the American West as Theodore Roosevelt had done for his health earlier. In 1914, he became a member of the U.S. Army until the end of World War I in 1918. After the war, he was a Member of the American Peace delegation in Paris, France for a year. Then in 1919 he was appointed as the Special Military aide to President Woodrow Wilson for a brief time before he was reappointed as a Military observer, intelligence officer in the Balkans, Near East and Middle East. His association with the U.S. military was not a brief affair. He served as a Reserve officer for 34 years, attaining the rank of colonel. His knowledge of the Middle East was valuable during World War II. In 1925, he helped establish a voting system in Tacona, Africa, personally designing ballots and setting up polling places in remote areas. While traveling the world he continued to write and create a variety of types and kinds of art, along with his work as a diplomat and military delegate. He died in 1967, leaving behind two children.

He is known exclusively from the medieval Georgian annals which make him a son of the king of Armenia, whom Professor Cyril Toumanoff identifies with the Arsacid, Vologases II (r. 186-198).

History Ashton was born in Islington, London, a son of Julian Rossi Ashton and his wife Eliza Ann Pugh, who with their family moved to Melbourne in 1878, and Sydney five years later, where his father founded his famous art school. Ashton became a junior shipping reporter of The Sydney Morning Herald but, two years later, he moved to Melbourne, where he was given the position of reporter by The Argus. He also drew portraits for the Sydney Daily Telegraph in his late teenage years and early adulthood. By his early twenties, Ashton had become a well-known figure in the local media and newspaper companies, writing music, literary and art reviews. He was given the title of music critic in 1910. Ashton was celebrated for his short stories in The Bulletin, following which success he began selling his paintings in art galleries, then began writing for British magazines such as Pall Mall Gazette and Chambers's Journal. He became a respected and dedicated member of magazines and newspaper companies. He resumed his criticism of music, and other arts in 1926, when he was made an associate editor. Ashton had never worked as a full-time artist; however despite this, in 1938 he won the Sydney sesquicentenary prize for landscape drawings. Ashton was, as well as an artist, a musician who had been known to entertain guests and lodgers at his Mosman house; it was because of this that the suggestion of forming the first Sydney String Quartet was put forward. Ashton was an amateur entomologist specializing in cicadas. He was president of the Royal Art Society from 1942 to 1945 or later (his father held that office 1897‚Äì1898 and 1907‚Äì1921). Ashton died at age 86 in New South Wales and was cremated. Family Ashton was the eldest child of artist Julian Rossi Ashton and Eliza Ann, n√©e Pugh, his first wife. While attending his father's art school, Ashton began a relationship with Mary Ethel Roberts (died 18 December 1945), whom he married on 24 January 1908. Together, they had three sons and one daughter. A month after his wife's death, Ashton resigned from The Sun in order to devote his time to painting and reading, and to be closer to his family.

Before moving to California in 1959, he spent his young adulthood in the Northern Plains, performing with and writing for territory bands booked out of Omaha, Nebraska. He was the brother of Clare Fischer. Fischer was a faculty member at College of the Canyons, as Jazz Band Director and Instructor of Jazz Studies, from 1977 to 2005.  Growing up  Fischer was born in 1924 in Durand, Michigan. His mother, Luella Blanche Roussin, was of French descent, and his father, Cecil Harold Fischer, was of German descent. Both were born in Canada at the turn of the 20th century. Fischer was the oldest of four children. One of his brothers was Clare Fischer. His mother played piano, his father played banjo, and his uncle played C melody saxophone. There was always music in his house. Fischer began playing the trumpet at age 13 and then saxophone the following year. His mother nicknamed him \\"Dirk\\" when he was 13. While playing in territory bands, friends endearingly called him \\"Dirty Dirk.\\" Fischer graduated from South High School in Grand Rapids, Michigan Before being drafted, Fischer and three friends formed a quartet called the Aristocats that played at Club Cherrio in Muskegon, Michigan. The band included Rich Henry (alto), Hamilton Allen (piano), and Mike Balish (drums).  Army years  During World War II, Fischer was drafted and served three years in the U.S. Army where he worked his way up to the Army Service Forces Bands. He entered the Army at Camp Barkley, Texas, near Abilene, where after basic training he enrolled in cooks-and-baker school. While working for a company kitchen, he began playing saxophone and trumpet with the local Medical Replacement Training Center Band. The Army transferred him from the kitchen to the band. He formed a lifelong friendship with jazz saxophonist and clarinetist Al Drootin from Boston. On the recommendation of a warrant officer who led an Army band at Camp Reynolds, Pennsylvania, a general changed Fischer's transfer overseas and sent him instead to Camp Lee, Virginia, home of the band training unit for the Armed Forces. Fischer spent six months at Fort Lee where instructors such as Gil Evans and Sanford (\\"Sandy\\") J. Siegelstein were assigned. The Camp housed two hundred and fifty Allied Forces musicians. Although Fischer took a course in arranging from Evans, who had been drafted, he already knew and practiced what Evans was teaching.TV interview of Dirk Fischer by Stephen K. Peeples, December 1, 2004; transcription published January 23, 2005, SCVTV Fischer was a member of a black military big band in Pennsylvania. When the Army segregated soldiers by race, music helped him bridge the gap.  Territory bands  Under the G.I. Bill, Fischer studied trumpet with Daniel Benner Tetzlaff and orchestration with William Muelbe. Both were members of the Minneapolis Symphony. He studied tonal materials with Jack Nowicki, who had studied with Paul Hindemith and Joseph Shillinger, and 20th Century counterpoint with Ernst Krenek. Early in his career, Fischer played trumpet and valve trombone in several territory bands, all booked out of Omaha by the National Orchestra Service, including the Teddy Philips band, Little John Beecher Orchestra, Joe Vera Latin Ensemble, Walter Martie, John Paul Jones, and Lee Williams. These bands became the outlet for his arrangements and compositions during the late 1940s and 1950s. He directed some shows, wrote most of the \\"special\\" arrangements, and drove the sleeper bus. He was also road manager for John Beecher. In 1959 he left the Beecher band when the National Orchestra service was going out of business.  Living in California  Fischer arrived in Los Angeles in 1959. He spent the next six years working in recording studios, ghost writing for other composers and arrangers. Little of his work had his name on it. He did some union contracting for strings and other people in orchestras, including his brother's recording sessions, and did a lot of copy work. Having been separated from his first wife for some time, his second wife appeared at the Rams Restaurant, in Los Angeles, where Fischer was working. Fischer hired her in November 1965, and they were married on September 5, 1966. They opened the Owl Coffee Shop in Van Nuys and ran it for fourteen years. The business allowed him to go to music school and his wife to enter nursing school. After transferring credits earned on the GI bill from a college in Minnesota, Fischer earned credits from Cal State Los Angeles and Cal State Northridge to complete a California Teaching Credential. A California Teaching Credential is a certification given in lieu of a traditional diploma to people with professional expertise and experience who complete accredited, collegiate hours to teach at a junior college. Candidates needed strong recommendation letters. The Army gave him special considerations well above his rank of Private First Class. In the 1970s, jazz studies was only beginning to enter traditional music pedagogy. Finding qualified teachers, those at the pinnacle of their field, meant having to draw from the jazz profession rather than academia. The College of the Canyons found Fischer by accident. At the suggestion of his wife, Fischer visited the college as a way to play music and meet others with his interest. In 1977, he became the first Instructor of Jazz Studies at College of the Canyons. He led the college's first annual RK Downs Jazz Festival.The Jazz Festival is named after Robert K. Downs, tenor saxophonist, clarinetist, high school band director, first Music Department Chair at College of the Canyons, big band arranger, and Fischer's credentialing mentor. The first festival was in 1976.  Personal life  Fischer had two sons and a daughter from his first marriage to Lula Frances Leak (b. 1930, married 1948, divorced August 1966, Los Angeles). Lula was a big band singer. His eldest son, Louis Andr√© Fischer, is a record producer, drummer with Rufus, and an administrator at McNalley Smith College of Music in St. Paul, Minnesota. Fischer had stepsons and a son from his second marriage of 40 years to Rosalindo (\\"Roz\\") Joyce Fischer, former surname Satin, ' Baum (b. 1938 - d. 2005). They were married in Las Vegas on September 5, 1966.Clark County Recorders Office, Marriage Records, Book 233, pg. 379 Fischer died on February 25, 2013 in Valencia, California. Before his death, he suffered from colon cancer.

RoXaN is a protein that contains tetratricopeptide repeat and leucine-aspartate repeat as well as zinc finger domains. This protein also interacts with the rotavirus non-structural protein NSP3.  Function  Rotavirus mRNAs are capped but not polyadenylated, and viral proteins are translated by the cellular translation machinery. This is accomplished through the action of the viral Nonstructural Protein NSP3 which specifically binds the 3' consensus sequence of viral mRNAs and interacts with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4G I. RoXaN (rotavirus X protein associated with NSP3) is 110-kDa cellular protein that contains a minimum of three regions predicted to be involved in protein‚Äìprotein or nucleic acid‚Äìprotein interactions. A tetratricopeptide repeat region, a protein‚Äìprotein interaction domain most often found in multiprotein complexes, is present in the amino- terminal region. In the carboxy terminus, at least five zinc finger motifs are observed, further suggesting the capacity of RoXaN to bind other proteins or nucleic acids. Between these two regions exists a paxillin leucine-aspartate repeat (LD) motif which is involved in protein‚Äìprotein interactions.  Clinical significance  RoXaN is capable of interacting with NSP3 in vivo and during rotavirus infection. Domains of interaction correspond to the dimerization domain of NSP3 (amino acids 163 to 237) and the LD domain of RoXaN (amino acids 244 to 341). The interaction between NSP3 and RoXaN does not impair the interaction between NSP3 and eIF4G I, and a ternary complex made of NSP3, RoXaN, and eIF4G I can be detected in rotavirus-infected cells, implicating RoXaN in translation regulation. Expression of RoXaN was found to be correlated with a higher tumor grad in GIST (gastrointestinal stromal tumors).

SSS* is based on the notion of solution trees. Informally, a solution tree can be formed from any arbitrary game tree by pruning the number of branches at each MAX node to one. Such a tree represents a complete strategy for MAX, since it specifies exactly one MAX action for every possible sequence of moves made by the opponent. Given a game tree, SSS* searches through the space of partial solution trees, gradually analyzing larger and larger subtrees, eventually producing a single solution tree with the same root and Minimax value as the original game tree. SSS* never examines a node that alpha-beta pruning would prune, and may prune some branches that alpha-beta would not. Stockman speculated that SSS* may therefore be a better general algorithm than alpha-beta. However, Igor Roizen and Judea Pearl have shown that the savings in the number of positions that SSS* evaluates relative to alpha/beta is limited and generally not enough to compensate for the increase in other resources (e.g., the storing and sorting of a list of nodes made necessary by the best-first nature of the algorithm). However, Aske Plaat, Jonathan Schaeffer, Wim Pijls and Arie de Bruin have shown that a sequence of null-window alpha-beta calls is equivalent to SSS* (i.e., it expands the same nodes in the same order) when alpha-beta is used with a transposition table, as is the case in all game-playing programs for chess, checkers, etc. Now the storing and sorting of the OPEN list were no longer necessary. This allowed the implementation of (an algorithm equivalent to) SSS* in tournament quality game-playing programs. Experiments showed that it did indeed perform better than Alpha-Beta in practice, but that it did not beat NegaScout. The reformulation of a best-first algorithm as a sequence of depth-first calls prompted the formulation of a class of null-window alpha- beta algorithms, of which MTD-f is the best known example. Algorithm There is a priority queue OPEN that stores states (J, s, h) or the nodes, where J \\\\- node identificator (Dewey's notation is used to identify nodes, \\\\epsilon is a root), s\\\\in\\\\\\\\{L,S\\\\\\\\} \\\\- state of the node J (L - the node is live, which means it's not solved yet and S - the node is solved), h\\\\in(-\\\\infty, \\\\infty) \\\\- value of the solved node. Items in OPEN queue are sorted descending by their h value. If more than one node has the same value of h, a node left-most in the tree is chosen. OPEN := { (e, L, inf) } while true do // repeat until stopped pop an element p=(J, s, h) from the head of the OPEN queue if J = e and s = S then STOP the algorithm and return h as a result else apply Gamma operator for p \\\\Gamma operator for p=(J,s,h) is defined in the following way: if s = L then if J is a terminal node then (1.) add (J, S, min(h, value(J))) to OPEN else if J is a MIN node then (2.) add (J.1, L, h) to OPEN else (3.) for j=1..number_of_children(J) add (J.j, L, h) to OPEN else if J is a MIN node then (4.) add (parent(J), S, h) to OPEN remove from OPEN all the states that are associated with the children of parent(J) else if is_last_child(J) then // if J is the last child of parent(J) (5.) add (parent(J), S, h) to OPEN else (6.) add (parent(J).(k+1), L, h) to OPEN // add state associated with the next child of parent(J) to OPEN References External links *Chess Programming Wiki *George Stockman's website Category:Search algorithms Category:Articles with example code ","title":"SSS*"},{"id":"14021576","text":"The Mabee-Gerrer Museum of Art is a non-profit art museum in Shawnee, Oklahoma, USA. It is located on the Oklahoma Baptist University Green Campus, being the campus of the former St. Gregory's University. The museum operated independently of St. Gregory's and survived its closure. The museum‚Äôs collection includes over 3,500 artworks, and spans over 6,000 years of art, and represents cultures from around the world including ancient Egyptian, Chinese, pre-Columbian, African, Native American, European, and American art. The museum houses the official portrait of Pope Pius X and Oklahoma‚Äôs only Egyptian mummies. The museum includes a gift shop that sells educational toys, publications related to their exhibitions and arts and crafts from local artisans. The MGMoA is a member of the Oklahoma Association of Museums and a member agency of Oklahoma City's Allied Arts. The museum hosts the annual festival Arts Trek. History The Egyptian gallery showcases a sarcophagus, a Roman era Egyptian mummy and the mummy of a woman named Tutu who died approximately 332 BCE. The museum is named for Fr. Gregory Gerrer, a Benedictine monk of St. Gregory's Abbey, who was an art historian and art collector. During his travels in the United States, Europe, Africa and South America, he acquired art and artifacts to exhibit in Oklahoma. In 1919, the collection moved to Benedictine Hall where it was called St. Gregory's Abbey Art Gallery and Museum. G. Patrick Riley visited the museum as a child in the early 1940s, and credits these visits as his inspiration to become an artist. Starting in 1962, the Gerrer collection was on long term loan to the Oklahoma Science and Arts Foundation in Oklahoma City. St Gregory's Abbey built a new building as a permanent home for the collection with matching funds from the Mabee Foundation. The Mabee-Gerrer Museum of Art opened in 1979. The building was designed by Chadsey/Architects from Tulsa, Oklahoma. =Etruscan Treasures= The museum was the exclusive United States venue to show Etruscan Treasures, an exhibit which featured Etruscan and Roman gold work, as well as artifacts from the Vatican Museums. This was the first time that the gold jewelry, from the collection of Prince Fabrizio Alliata di Montereale, was publicly displayed. The exhibit ran from June 1 through October 31, 2004, and was featured in a documentary produced by Oklahoma's Public Television Station. =Mummy Research= In August 2015, St. Anthony Shawnee Hospital performed CT scans on the two Egyptian mummies in the museum's collection. The mummies previously visited the same hospital in 1991 for X-rays. The scans showed that Tutu's organs had been individually mummified and placed back inside her stomach and chest cavity before she was wrapped in linen. Collection The museum's collection began with a gift in 1903. While Fr. Gregory Gerrer was traveling in the Holy Land, he was presented with an Egyptian scarab with the hieroglyphic goose symbol on it. The museum houses an artifact collection that includes an ancient Egyptian mummy and sarcophagus, ancient Egyptian animal mummies, Roman glass, ancient Greek pottery, ancient Chinese terracotta figures, European ivory and icons, Venetian armor, Mesoamerican stone carvings, shrunken heads, Spanish colonial paintings, and African masks and bronzes. The paintings collection includes work from Guido Reni, Tintoretto, Guercino, Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo, Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, William Merritt Chase, Albert Bierstadt and Robert Priseman. =Spanish Colonial Art= The institute's holdings in Spanish Colonial art include retablos (small religious paintings, frequently on tin), wooden sculptures of saints, and paintings. One anonymous painting, Christ of Ixmiquilpan, dates to the early 19th century and captures a miraculous alter scene in Mexico City. A temporary exhibition of Spanish Colonial Art ran from April to June in 2010. The collection was shown at the Arlington Museum of Art in Arlington, Texas in a special exhibition from April 12 to May 26, 2013. See also *Fr.

Early life  Staden was born the son of a burgher (bourgeoisie) in Ahlen, near M√ºnster, Germany. His mother, Kattarina Ossenbach, died in the plague, and he had a brother, Bernhardus von Staden, a Roman Catholic priest in Ahlen, and a sister. When attending a Catholic seminary in Ahlen, Staden was accused of stabbing a fellow seminarian with an awl. His cousin, Steffan Hovener, invited him to live in Livonia with him, where \\"he would not be disturbed.\\" In Livonia, he worked on building the city walls, but didn't like the labor and ran away to the Wolgarten estate in Wolmar, Valmiera. There, the wife of Wolgarten entrusted him with her estates when she learned he could read and write in Latin and German, and was learning Latvian. After Wolgarten remarried and moved away, Staden also moved, to Karkus, and became a merchant. After trouble erupted in the Livonian government, Staden sent a letter to his friend, Joachim Schroter at the border town of Dorpat, which was held by the Moskovits. He wrote that he would serve the Tsar Ivan IV if he were paid. He was invited to Moscow, where he met the Tsar. Ivan was impressed with Staden and invited him to dinner; soon after, he became a member of the Tsar's political police, or Oprichnina.  Living in Moskovia  Staden's account of Moskovia, The Land and Government of Muscovy, was addressed to the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolf II. It consisted of four parts: a petition, a description of Moskovia, a plan for the invasion of Moskovia from the north, and the author's autobiography. Staden hoped to influence the emperor to invade Moskovia, restore the region to the Teutonic Order, and be rewarded. The Elector of the Palatinate, Georg Hans Count von Veldenz-Lutzelstein, had similar hopes and took Staden into his employment. Between 1578 and 1582 Staden worked as a sort of spy for the Teutonic Order. He sent his proposal to the Order's Grand Master, and later to the Kings of Poland and Sweden. Historians discovered this document in 1839 in the Prussian state archives, knowing of the count's plans, but no link to Staden was discovered until a few years later. His accounts are the most insightful and descriptive of the day, and displayed the disorder of the Moskovian government under Ivan the Terrible. Heinrich von Staden calls Tsar Ivan a \\"horrid tryant\\", but wrote more neutrally than his contemporaries. His narratives of the Oprichnina are the only ones written by a member, and the history of the Oprichnina was rewritten after Staden's accounts were found. He describes the targets of Ivan's terror as individual families which the Tsar believed to be dangerous to his authority, rather than against the entire boyar class as previously thought.  Controversy  Some historians question the authenticity of Staden's claims. Academician S.B. Veselovsky was very critical of the Notes on Muscovy. The historian D.N. Alshits, comparing Staden's text with the historical realities of the epoch and with the newly discovered documents, came to the conclusion that Staden was not in Oprichnina at all, but only pretended to be oprichnik, in order to raise his status in the eyes of Emperor Rudolph, his patron and addressee of notes on Muscovy.–ê–ª—å—à–∏—Ü –î. –ù. –ù–∞—á–∞–ª–æ —Å–∞–º–æ–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–≤–∏—è –≤ –ú–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤–∏–∏: –ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ò–≤–∞–Ω–∞ –ì—Ä–æ–∑–Ω–æ–≥–æ. ‚Äî Leningrad: –ù–∞—É–∫–∞, 1988.

The date for the festival was repeatedly postponed due to financial problems. =Alex Cooley= \\"COOLEY GO HOME\\" A mural was painted near the festival's office by festival protesters.Eventually some of the promoters were able to persuade Alex Cooley (Atlanta International Pop Festival, Texas International Pop Festival and 2nd Atlanta International Pop Festival) to take over production of the festival. The dates were then finalized for April 1‚Äì3, 1972, coinciding with Holy Week. This sparked a high volume of criticism by both the government and the press of Puerto Rico. \\"Then the newspapers [from Puerto Rico] got a hold of it and they started just slamming it.\\" said Cooley in a 2006 interview. =Venue= The designated area for Fiesta Del Sol/Mar y Sol was mainly in the countryside and extended to the Los Tubos beach. This area is located between the beach and the Tortuguero Lagoon and is divided by a public road (which was closed during the festival). On the side facing the beach they had the main showering area, camping areas, the infirmary and the festival's office. On the side facing the lagoon they had the stage and merchants area. The coordinates are: 18¬∞28'20\\"N 66¬∞26'46\\"W. The festival =Performers= The opener of the festival was local jazz group \\"Rubber Band\\"These are the performers for which there is evidence (audio, photos or multiple witnesses) that they did play at the festival: * Allman Brothers Band (live material officially & unofficially released) * Long John Baldry (live material officially released) * Banda del K-rajo (local rock band) * Bang * Brownsville Station (live material unofficially released) * Dave Brubeck w/ Gerry Mulligan (live material unofficially released) * Cactus (live performance on April 3, 1972 ‚Äì live material officially released) * Alice Cooper (live material officially released) * Jonathan Edwards (live material officially & unofficially released) * Elephant's Memory * Emerson, Lake & Palmer (live performance on April 2, 1972 ‚Äì live material officially released) * Faces w/ Rod Stewart (live material officially & unofficially released) * Fran Ferrer y Puerto Rico 2010 (local salsa band) (live material unofficially released) * J.

Introduced and played onstage by David Peel. Recorded from the audience by Pedro Collazo. John Lennon wanted to attend the festival along with his wife Yoko Ono but ended up not flying down to the island due to problems he was having with the government at the time regarding their attempts to deport him. Instead he sent a recorded message with his friend David Peel who was set to perform at the festival. During his performance (April 2) and after a short introduction, David Peel played the tape to the audience which was mainly greetings from John and Yoko. =Billy Joel's first major performance= Billy Joel performing at Mar y Sol on Sunday, April 2.One performance that stood out was Billy Joel's. At the time few knew who he was. He had only released his first album Cold Spring Harbor with a small record company called Family Productions and the album was not doing very well. But his performance at Mar y Sol electrified the crowd and gave a major boost to his career. He was eventually signed by Columbia Records in 1973. =Cancelled performers= Some artists cancelled due to the legal problems the festival promoters were having with the government of Puerto Rico. Some were cancelled by the producer due to schedule conflicts. * Black Sabbath ‚Äì They were ready and waiting at the Cerromar hotel in Dorado the last day of the festival. However, at the moment there were no more helicopters available and it was decided that they would never make it by street due to the bad traffic caused by the festival. * Bloodrock ‚Äì They were at the festival but got cancelled by the producer. * Flash Cadillac * Fleetwood Mac * Malo =Other listed artists= It is unclear if the following artists performed or not. They were part of the performer's list and some were even mentioned at the beginning of the festival but there is no further information on whether they were cancelled or if they played. * Ashton, Gardner and Dyke * Savoy Brown * Roberta Flack * Goose Creek Symphony * Al Kooper * Kenny Loggins and Jim Messina * Poco * Billy Preston * Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels =Sound / Woodstock= Eric Blackstead standing next to the Hanley Sound truck at Mar y Sol.Sound for the festival was engineered by sound engineer Bill Hanley, who was also in charge of the sound at Woodstock. The speakers were also the same ones used at Woodstock. Alex Cooley also had Eric Blackstead, producer of Woodstock: Music from the Original Soundtrack and More, as his audio consultant. Music albums Soundboard at Mar y Sol =Various artists: Mar y Sol= The album Mar y Sol: The First International Puerto Rico Pop Festival was released in 1972 by Atco Records. It features well-known artists such as Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Dr. John, Long John Baldry and The Allman Brothers Band, as well as up-and-coming artists such as Mahavishnu Orchestra with John McLaughlin, John Nitzinger, Osibisa, Jonathan Edwards and Cactus. The album was never released on CD. Some major performers who were not on the album include Alice Cooper, Dave Brubeck, and Faces. =Cactus: 'Ot 'n' Sweaty= That same year Cactus released the LP 'Ot 'n' Sweaty which included 3 songs from the festival on side one (\\"Let Me Swim\\", \\"Big Bad Mother Boogie\\" and \\"Our Li'l Rock & Roll Thing\\") and 5 new studio songs on side two. Although most songs were new studio recordings, the album art as well as the title were inspired by the festival. All photos used on the album were also taken at the festival during their performance. =ELP: Live at the Mar y Sol Festival '72= In 2011 (thirty nine years later) Emerson, Lake & Palmer released Live at the Mar Y Sol Festival '72 which included their entire performance at the festival. The original 16-track tapes were found by the band in 2006 and released for the first time in 2007 in the boxed set From the Beginning (on Disc 5). =Alice Cooper: Old School: 1964‚Äì1974= Also in 2011 Alice Cooper released an instrumental version \\"School's Out\\" from their Mar y Sol performance in his boxed set \\"Old School: 1964‚Äì1974\\" (Disc 2, track 2). The entire soundboard recording of their performance at the festival exists but there is no indication that this will ever be released in its entirety. =Bootlegs= There's other music of Mar y Sol that exists only as bootlegs. One of them is the entire set of Billy Joel which is a deteriorated version of the official soundboard recording. There's also a 3 CD series of audience recordings by attendees Pedro Collazo and Oscar Mandry (from Ponce, Puerto Rico) called \\"The Collazo/Mandry Tapes\\" which was edited and prepared by Mar y Sol Festival's historian, Reniet Ramirez, for free online distribution. This series of bootlegs include 38 songs by: Allman Brothers Band, BB King, Brownsville Station, Dave Brubeck (w/ Gerry Mulligan), David Peel and the Lower East Side, Faces, Fran Ferrer y Puerto Rico 2010, Herbie Mann, J. Geils Band, Jonathan Edwards, Nitzinger and Pot Liquor. Video Mar y Sol was going to be filmed professionally but the film makers backed out due to the many legal problems the promoters were having on the island. It is believed that most, if not all, news footage has been lost. Only amateur footage exists and so far only three 8mm films have been found and published online. None of this footage contains full songs from any performer, instead they capture random footage from different areas of the festival. Legacy =Short story= In 1978 Puerto Rican poet Manuel Abreu Adorno published a 12 short story book titled \\"Llegaron Los Hippies\\" (The Hippies Came [arrived]). The main short story, also titled \\"Llegaron Los Hippies\\", was written about Mar y Sol. The book was very rare and has been out of print for decades. In 2011 it was translated and published again. The new version contains all 12 short stories in both English and Spanish. =Remember Mar y Sol, the concert= In 1982, in celebration of the 10th anniversary, a concert was held in San Juan, Puerto Rico called \\"Remember Mar y Sol\\". This concert had nothing to do with the original producer (Alex Cooley) and the only performer from the original festival was David Peel. Information about this concert is very scarce but most people remember it being a complete failure. =A revived subject= As opposed to Woodstock and other similar music festivals from those days, the subject of Mar y Sol was quickly forgotten. Most reviews (both local and in the U.S.) described the festival as a failure and a mistake. There was never a film, a documentary or book about it to prove otherwise or to at least serve as a source of information. Mar y Sol became a rare subject that through the years kept disappearing. The only souvenir available was the Mar y Sol LP which was eventually discontinued and never released on CD. In 1993 however, Reniet Ramirez (from Puerto Rico), found out about Mar y Sol and became very interested with the subject and in 2004 decided to become the historian of Mar y Sol. Even though he was not at the festival he had gathered enough information to be able to start his website http://www.marysolfestival.com which now has a big following. =Mar y Sol site today= The structure for the showers at the festival is still almost intact in 2010. * South side: The area of the festival on the side facing the lagoon (where the stage was located) was never used for anything else and was eventually made into a nature reserve. * North side: The side facing the beach was eventually divided in two areas; one section was made into a balneario while the rest remains almost intact, including the showers structure (originally used to provide water to cows) and a water tank. This area is also used every year to hold the Festival Playero Los Tubos de Manat√≠. =40th anniversary attendees reunion= Mar y Sol attendees and other enthusiasts walk (in 2012) through what was one of the camping areas during the festival. On Saturday March 31, 2012, while filming an amateur documentary about Mar y Sol, historian Reniet Ramirez, hosted an improvised gathering (including festival attendees as well as younger people who are enthusiasts of the subject) Gallery File:Stage wide shot Mar Y Sol Festival April-72.jpgWide shot of the stage area (Photo: Cesar Rosa) File:Beach - Mar Y Sol Festival April-72.jpgThe beach was one of the main attractions at the festival (Photo: Cesar Rosa) File:Alice Cooper Mar Y Sol Festival April2-72.jpg Alice Cooper performed around 5:00am on Sunday April 2 (Photo: Pedro Collazo) File:Stonehenge Mar Y Sol Festival April3-72.jpg Stonehenge performed for the second time in the afternoon of Monday April 3 (Photo: Ron Cutuli) File:Showers Mar Y Sol Festival April-72.jpg The showers area was located near the beach and next to a creek (Photo: Cesar Rosa) File:Herbie Mann Mar Y Sol Festival April-72.jpgHerbie Mann performed in the morning of Sunday April 2 (Photo: Pedro Collazo) See also *List of historic rock festivals *List of jam band music festivals References External links * *Alex Cooley official website Category:Rock festivals in Puerto Rico Category:1972 live albums Category:Atco Records live albums Category:Music festivals established in 1972 Category:Pop music festivals in the United States Category:1972 music festivals ","title":"Mar y Sol Pop Festival"},{"id":"14021780","text":"Rev.

It is set in British Nigeria. The lead Nigerian characters were played by African-Americans Paul Robeson and Nina Mae McKinney. The film proved a significant commercial and critical success, giving Korda the first of his four nominations for Best Film at the Venice Film Festival. Plot Sanders (Leslie Banks) is a British colonial District Commissioner in Colonial Nigeria. He tries to rule his province fairly, including the various tribes comprising the Peoples of the River. He is regarded with respect by some and with fear by others, among whom he is referred to as \\"Sandi\\" and \\"Lord Sandi\\". He has an ally in Bosambo, a literate and educated tribal chief (played by the American actor, Paul Robeson). When Sanders goes on leave, another chief, King Mofolaba, spreads the rumour that \\"Sandi is dead.\\" Inter-tribal war seems inevitable, and the situation is made worse by gun-runners and slavers. His relief, Ferguson (known to the natives as Lord Ferguson), is unequal to the task; he is captured and killed by King Mofolaba. Sanders returns to restore peace. When Bosambo's wife Lilongo (Nina Mae McKinney) is kidnapped, the chief tracks down her kidnappers. Captured by them, he is saved by a relief force commanded by Sanders. Bosambo kills King Mofolaba and is subsequently named by Sanders as the King of the Peoples of the River. Cast * Leslie Banks as Commissioner R.G.

Bourdillon is credited as an adviser. Paul Robeson disowns the film Actor Paul Robeson and actress Ir√©n √Ågay on the set of Sanders of the River, London, 1934 The African-American singer and actor Paul Robeson, a civil rights activist, accepted the role of Bosambo while living in London. At the time, he was studying the roots of pan-African culture through studies of language and music. He felt that if he could portray the Nigerian leader, Bosambo, with cultural accuracy and dignity, he could help audiences‚Äîespecially Black audiences‚Äîto understand and respect the roots of Black culture. He took the role on the condition that the film would portray Africans positively. The filmmakers took an unusual step towards authenticity by sending a film crew on a four-month voyage into remote areas of Africa. They recorded traditional African dances and ceremonies, with the intention of using this footage integrated with scenes shot in the studio that included the future President and Prime Minister of Kenya Jomo Kenyatta as one of the extras.pp. 199-200 Neame, Ronald with Cooper, Barbara Roisman Straight from the Horse's Mouth: Ronald Neame, an Autobiography Scarecrow Press, 27 September 2003 After the filming, Robeson was asked back to the studio for retakes of some scenes. He discovered that the film‚Äôs message had been changed during editing; it seemed to justify imperialism and upholding the \\"White Man's Burden.\\" The finished film was dedicated to \\"the handful of white men whose everyday work is an unsung saga of courage and efficiency\\".\\"Korda and Empire\\", BFI screenonline page Bosambo was changed from a Nigerian leader to a servile lackey of British colonial rule. Robeson was furious and complained: > The imperialist plot had been placed in the plot during the last days five > days of shooting...I was roped into the picture because I wanted to portray > the culture of the African people and I committed a faux pas which convinced > me that I had failed to weigh the problems of 150,000,000 native > Africans...I hate the picture.Duberman, Martin, Paul Robeson: The Discovery > of Africa, 1989, p. 182. In 1938, Robeson added disparagingly: \\"It is the only film of mine that can be shown in Italy or Germany, for it shows the negro as Fascist states desire him - savage and childish.\\"Duberman (1989), Paul Robeson, p. 180. Robeson was so disillusioned by the picture that he attempted, but failed, to buy back all the prints to prevent it from being shown.Robeson, Susan, A Pictorial Biography of Paul Robeson: The Whole World in His Hands, 1981, p. 73.

(Grand Emblem of Royal Arch Masonry) A lodge room set out for use by a Holy Royal Arch ChapterThe Holy Royal Arch is a degree of Freemasonry. The Royal Arch is present in all main masonic systems, though in some it is worked as part of Craft ('mainstream') Freemasonry, and in others in an appendant ('additional') order. Royal Arch Masons meet as a Chapter; in the Supreme Order of the Holy Royal Arch as practised in the British Isles, much of Europe and the Commonwealth, Chapters confer the single degree of Royal Arch Mason. Membership In the British Isles, most of continental Europe (including the masonically expanding states of eastern Europe),See references to eastern European expansion of the Royal Arch here. and most nations of the Commonwealth (with the notable exception of Canada), the teachings of Royal Arch Masonry are contained in the \\"Supreme Order of the Holy Royal Arch\\" ‚Äì a stand-alone degree of Freemasonry which is open to those who have completed the three Craft degrees. Until 1823, only freemasons who had previously passed through the chair of a Craft lodge were allowed to join. Today, candidates for an English Holy Royal Arch Chapter are required to have been a Master Mason for four weeks or more.Supreme Grand Chapter of England How to Join Royal Arch In Freemasonry in Scotland, the candidate for the Royal Arch must also be a Mark Master Mason, a degree which is part of the Royal Arch series. It can be worked in the Chapter, or more often has been worked in a Scottish Lodge. After the Mark degree, a candidate must receive the Excellent Master degree, before being exalted to the Royal Arch degree. In Ireland a candidate must be a Master Mason for one year before being admitted as a member of a Royal Arch Chapter. The Degree of Mark Master Mason is taken separately first and only then can the Royal Arch Degree be taken. In the United States, Canada, Brazil, Israel, Mexico, Paraguay and the Philippines, the Royal Arch is not worked as a stand-alone degree as described above, but forms part of the York Rite system of additional Masonic degrees. Royal Arch Masons in the York Rite also meet as a Chapter, but the Royal Arch Chapter of the York Rite confers four different degrees: 'Mark Master Mason', 'Virtual Past Master', 'Most Excellent Master', and 'Royal Arch Mason'. While the York Rite degree of 'Royal Arch Mason' is roughly comparable to the Supreme Order of the Holy Royal Arch as practised in England and Wales, the other degrees may have equivalents in other appendant orders. The Royal Arch is also the subject of the 13th and 14th degrees of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry (called \\"Ancient and Accepted Rite\\" in England and Wales). Purpose and Teaching Similarly to Craft Freemasonry, the Royal Arch conveys moral and ethical lessons. In the three degrees of the Craft, the candidate is presented with a series of practical principles of service to his fellow man. But as man is not simply a practical being, he also has an essential spiritual aspect to his nature. The Royal Arch further develops this latter aspect by a contemplation of man's spiritual nature, not replacing but supporting what the candidate has learnt from his own religion. In the Chapter, the teachings of the Royal Arch are conveyed using a ritualised allegory based on the Old Testament telling of the return to Jerusalem from the Babylonian captivity to rebuild the City and Temple. In clearing the ground of Solomon's Temple for the foundations of a new temple, the candidate makes important discoveries. By adding a further explanation to the practical lessons of Craft Freemasonry, the Royal Arch is seen as an extension of the preceding degreesSee the comments below in section on \\"Development since the union\\". and the philosophical lessons conveyed are appropriate to that stage in a candidate's Masonic development. The symbol or Grand Emblem of Royal Arch Masonry is the Triple Tau. History =Origins= The exact origins of Royal Arch Masonry in general, and of the Holy Royal Arch in particular, are unknown except that it dates back to the mid 18th century. Although glimpses of Royal Arch vocabulary appear in Masonic literature from the 1720s, the first verifiable appearance of Royal Arch Masonry is in Ireland in the 1740s during a Dublin procession. According to Lodge No. 21's records, the ‚ÄúRoyal Arch‚Äù was carried in a procession by ‚Äútwo excellent Masons‚Äù through Youghal, Ireland, on 27 December 1743. The degree is also mentioned disapprovingly in Dassigny's \\"A serious and impartial enquiry into the cause of the present decay of Free-masonry in the Kingdom of Ireland\\" published in Dublin in 1744.Douglas Knoop, \\"The Genesis of Freemasonry\\", Manchester University Press, 1947Fifield Dassigny‚Äôs \\"A serious and impartial enquiry into the cause of the present decay of Free-masonry in the Kingdom of Ireland\\", published in Dublin in 1744, it is recorded that: \\"‚Ä¶a certain propagator of a false system some few years ago in this city [Dublin] who imposed upon several very worthy men under a pretense of being Master of the Royal Arch, which he asserted he had brought with him from the city of York; and that the beauties of the Craft did principally consist in the knowledge of this valuable piece of Masonry. However he carried on this scheme for several months and many of the learned and wise were his followers, till at length his fallacious art was discovered by a Brother of probity and wisdom, who had some small space before attained that excellent part of Masonry in London and plainly proved that his doctrine was false. Separate notes in this work indicate that the rite was practised in Dublin, London and York, and described it as an \\"organis'd body of men who have passed the chair\\" (i.e. served as the Master of a Craft lodge).Harry Carr, The Relationship between the Craft and the Royal Arch, in Harry Carr's World of Freemasonry, Lewis Masonic, 1984, p 383 In 1749, the Grand Lodge of Ireland issued warrants to Lodges 190 and 198 to establish \\"Royal Arch Lodges\\".A Short History of the Grand Lodge of Ireland by Br. Robert C. Blackburn =England and Wales= \\"Antients\\" vs. \\"Moderns\\" In 18th century England, the role and purpose of Royal Arch Masonry was the subject of a long debate between the two rival umbrella organisations of Freemasonry. In 1717, four Craft lodges had formed the original Premier Grand Lodge of England to govern Freemasonry as practiced in England. From 1751, this claim was contested by another group of Craft lodges which formed the Antient Grand Lodge of England. In the ensuing debate, the newer grand lodge became known for short as the \\"Antients\\", while the older grand lodge was referred to as the \\"Moderns\\". In 1746, Laurence Dermott, who would later become Grand Secretary of the \\"Antients\\", had been accepted into a Royal Arch Chapter in Dublin, which at that time was open only to those who had previously served as master of a Craft lodge. He regarded the Royal Arch as the fourth degree of Craft Masonry. Under his influence, the \\"Antients\\" championed the Royal Arch degree in England, while it was met with hostility in the Premier Grand Lodge of England. In 1764, a lodge of Scottish masons attached to the \\"Antients\\" switched sides and became the Caledonian Lodge attached to the \\"Moderns\\". The next year, they assisted in setting up a Royal Arch Chapter admitting masons from other Craft lodges which were attached to the \\"Moderns\\". In 1766, with the exaltation of Lord Blayney, the Grand Master of the \\"Moderns\\", this organisation became known as the \\"Excellent Grand and Royal Arch Chapter\\", taking on administrative responsibilities and thus becoming the first Grand Chapter in England.Pietre-Stones The Fourth Degree in the Craft, Yasha Beringer, retrieved 19 July 2012Camberley Lodge A.D. Matthews, An Historical Perspective on The Holy Royal Arch, Lecture July 2009, retrieved 18 September 2012 At the same time, James Heseltine, the Grand Secretary of the \\"Moderns\\", stated about Royal Arch Masonry that \\"It is part of Masonry but has no connection with Grand Lodge\\" in a letter to a senior German mason. He was also one of the signatories on the charter establishing the first Grand Chapter.Phoenix Masonry Bernard E.Jones, Freemason's Book of the Royal Arch, revised Carr, 1966, retrieved 23 September 2012 The minutes of the first meeting of Grand Chapter show that it met in the Turks Head, in the London district of Soho, the same tavern that had shortly before hosted the birth of the Antient Grand Lodge of England.Grand Chapter of England The First Grand Chapter, retrieved 20 September 2012 On this occasion, Thomas Dunckerley was elected to hold the office of Z (head officer of the Chapter) in the absence of the Grand Master and Deputy Grand Master. He was later appointed Grand Superintendent and promoted Royal Arch Masonry in the provincial lodges of the \\"Moderns\\" with considerable energy and success.Thomas Dunckerley, his life, labours, and letters by Henry Sadler, Kenning, London, 1891 pp 244-255 In 1774, the \\"Antients\\" formed their own Royal Arch Grand Chapter upon Laurence Dermott's instigation. Its members were Grand Lodge officers who happened to hold the Royal Arch degree, its meetings were ordained by Grand Lodge, and its proceedings approved by that same body. By the end of the 18th century, both Craft grand lodges thus had developed a different organisational approach to the Royal Arch. While the Grand Chapter of the \\"Moderns\\" was independent from their Craft Grand Lodge out of necessity, the Grand Chapter of the \\"Antients\\" was closely tied to the corresponding Craft Grand Lodge. For the masons organised in the \\"Antients\\", the Royal Arch became recognised as the fourth degree, open to those who had served as a master of a Craft Lodge. For the \\"Antients\\", Grand Chapter was little more than a cipher, registering names and processing admission fees. Effective governance of the Royal Arch degree rested with the Grand Lodge and the individual Craft lodges that also worked this fourth degree. Uniting the two grand lodges At the beginning of the 19th century, when the \\"Antients\\" and the \\"Moderns\\" moved from rivalry towards union, the role and purpose of the Royal Arch became a sticking point. The \\"Antients\\" viewed the Royal Arch as a fourth degree of Craft Freemasonry and worked it as part of the Craft ceremonies, while the \\"Moderns\\" almost totally ignored it. The latter held the opinion that Craft Freemasonry consisted of three degrees only and that the Royal Arch was at the most an extension of the third (Master Mason's) degree which was to be administered separately. In addition, the \\"Moderns\\" embedded certain teachings in their third degree ritual that the \\"Antients\\" only revealed to those joining the Royal Arch.Mackey's article on Jehovah retrieved 14 September 2012 In 1813, the \\"Antients\\" and \\"Moderns\\" agreed on an Act of Union and formed the United Grand Lodge of England. This was possible only after reaching a compromise on the role and purpose of Royal Arch Masonry. The compromise was that after the union, the Royal Arch degree would be fully recognised by the United Grand Lodge (to placate the \\"Antients\\"), but become a separate order (to placate the \\"Moderns\\") while all Craft Lodges would be given sanction to work the ceremony (to placate the \\"Antients\\"). At the same time, no compromise could be reached on the role and purpose of the Mark degree. It was effectively proscribed from the Union until the 1850s, until it became organised in an independent Grand Lodge of Mark Master Masons of England and Wales. In most countries outside England and Wales, however, Mark Masonry became attached to Royal Arch chapters. In its Book of Constitutions, the United Grand Lodge of England therefore declared that \\"...pure Antient Masonry consists of three degrees and no more, viz. those of the Entered Apprentice, the Fellow Craft, and the Master Mason including the Supreme Order of the Holy Royal Arch.\\".United Grand Lodge of England Constitutions 2001, p 1See the 'Preliminary Declaration' of the combined-volume \\"Grand Lodge Constitutions & Grand Chapter Regulations\\" for England and Wales. In 1817, four years after the \\"Antients\\" and \\"Moderns\\" had united their Craft grand lodges, the new United Grand Lodge oversaw the formation of a \\"Supreme Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of England\\" to govern the Holy Royal Arch in England and Wales. By that time, the Grand Chapter of the \\"Antients\\" had effectively ceased to exist (only a few meetings are recorded for the time after 1813), so their remaining members were simply absorbed into what had previously been the Grand Chapter of the \\"Moderns\\". Another significant constitutional development in English Royal Arch Masonry occurred in 1823, when Master Masons were allowed to join Holy Royal Arch Chapters without having previously passed through the chair of a Craft lodge. In 1835, the ritual was reformed, when part of the ceremony known as \\"Passing the Veils\\" was dropped. It was re-adopted by Bristol Chapters at the turn of the 20th century. Development since the union While the Act of Union of 1813 recognised the Supreme Order of the Holy Royal Arch as part of \\"pure, antient masonry\\", the wording in the United Grand Lodge of England's Book of Constitutions that \\"...pure Antient Masonry consists of three degrees and no more, viz. those of the Entered Apprentice, the Fellow Craft, and the Master Mason including the Supreme Order of the Holy Royal Arch\\" was subsequently often interpreted to suggest that the Holy Royal Arch was not an additional degree, but merely the completion of the Master Mason degree. That view was so widely held among freemasons in England and Wales that in the Royal Arch ritual the newly exalted candidate was informed that he must not think that he had taken a fourth degree but that he had in fact completed his third. (Statements to this effect can on occasion still be found today, e.g. \\"When a Freemason has attained the rank of a Master Mason he is then entitled [...] to be exalted into a Royal Arch Chapter in order to complete fully his Master Mason's Degree.\\") While expressing a compromise position between the traditional views of the \\"Antients\\" and \\"Moderns\\", this interpretation put the Holy Royal Arch in opposition to masonic practice in most countries outside England and Wales. No other masonic constitution ever claimed that the Third Degree and the Royal Arch are two parts of a single whole. The Supreme Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of England eventually questioned its own reasoning.See the statement by the English Supreme Grand Chapter's Pro First Grand Principal in November 2003. His speech is reproduced in \\"Freemasonry Today\\" magazine, issue 27, Winter 2003. Text available online here almost half way down page, headed \\"Changes Proposed in Royal Arch\\". In December 2003, the United Grand Lodge of England acknowledged and pronounced the status of the Supreme Order of the Holy Royal Arch to be \\"an extension to, but neither a superior nor a subordinate part of, the degrees which precede it\\". On 10 November 2004, after deliberations by a special working party, the Supreme Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of England at its regular meeting in London formally overturned the compromise position of 1813, and declared the Holy Royal Arch to be a separate degree in its own right and the completion of \\"pure ancient Masonry\\", which consists of the three Craft degrees and the Holy Royal Arch. Words in the ritual which propounded the earlier compromise position and led to misinterpretations were removed by mandatory regulation.There are many public-domain documents verifying these changes.This one is merely one example of many which demonstrate the requirement for removal of all references to the former compromise linking the Royal Arch with the Third Degree. The official position of the Supreme Grand Chapter today is that the \\"Royal Arch is the continuation of Craft Freemasonry\\" as taught in the three degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason; in that sense, \\"\\"pure ancient Masonry\\" can be seen as a journey of self-knowledge and discovery with the Royal Arch completing the practical lessons of the Craft by a contemplation of man's spiritual nature.\\"Provincial Grand Lodge of Middlesex, Royal Arch and the Provincial Grand Chapter of Middlesex, accessed 2 September 2014 =North America= Until the end of the 18th century, Masonic Lodges in North America performed Royal Arch ceremonies, as well as some others that are now more familiarly part of Knights Templar and the Red Cross of Constantine.Denslow, Ray and Everett C.

Denslow and Turnbull also quote earlier Masonic historian Robert Freke Gould's assertion from documentation that the Royal Arch existed in Youghal (in County Cork, Ireland), some time prior to 1743. Dr. Fifield D'Assigny also wrote of it in Ireland in 1744(Denslow, Ray and Everett C. Turnbull. History of Royal Arch Masonry Part One. Kessinger. . p. 127-129.) There is also a Royal Arch Chapter noted in 1769 in Massachusetts (St. Andrew's Royal Arch Chapter in Boston, then known as Royall Arch Lodge), where the first Knights Templar degree was also conferred.Karg, Barb, and John C. Young. 101 Things You Didn't Know About The Freemasons: Rites, Rituals, and the Ripper-All You Need to Know About This Secret Society!. Adams Media, 2007. p. 91. Through a report compiled by the Committee on History and Research appointed by the Grand Chapter of Massachusetts in 1953 and 1954, it was found that St. Andrew's Royal Arch Chapter was the oldest constituted Chapter in the Western Hemisphere, having been officially constituted 9 April 1769, though the records implied that the Chapter had been working prior to that date, and perhaps as early as 1762. The report also states that it is unknown whether the Fredericksburg Lodge in Virginia conferred only the degree of 'Royal Arch Mason' or the entire series of American Capitular Masonry degrees.Denslow, Ray and Everett C. Turnbull. History of Royal Arch Masonry Part One. Kessinger. . pp. 195-99. Pennsylvania, on the other hand, claims to have the oldest extant Royal Arch Chapter in the world. Royal Arch Chapter No. 3 (formerly Jerusalem Royal Arch Chapter No. 3, and before that Royal Arch Lodge No. 3) has complete minutes going back as far as 3 December 1767. (The minutes from this date mention approving the minutes from the previous meeting.) This chapter began meeting under the authority of the Grand Lodge of England (Ancients) and it is believed that the chapter was constituted around 1758, but this date has yet to be proven.Proceedings of the Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of the State of California at its Annual Convocation, A.I. 2418.

After the independence of the American Colonies in 1776, Freemasonry in the United States remained relatively little influenced by the rivalry between the \\"Antients\\" and \\"Moderns\\" in England. In 1797, a group of Royal Arch masons met in Hartford to try to establish some sort of governing body for degrees that were largely conferred in the New England states, which became the Grand Chapter of the Northern States, and later was broken down into the state-by-state Grand Chapter system.Denslow, Ray and Everett C. Turnbull. History of Royal Arch Masonry Part One. Kessinger. . p. 244. This body later became the General Grand Chapter, Royal Arch Masons International.General Grand Chapter, Royal Arch Masons International Accessed 15 August 2008. In the United States and in Canada, the teachings of the Holy Royal Arch as practised in England and Wales are mainly contained in the degree of 'Royal Arch Mason', which is now one of four degrees worked by Royal Arch Chapters in the York Rite. Role within different masonic constitutions The Holy Royal Arch is affiliated to many different masonic constitutions worldwide, many of which place different emphasis on the order. = England, Europe and Australasia= The position of the Holy Royal Arch among the Masonic appendant bodies in England and Wales The English system of Royal Arch Masonry consists of a single appendant order, which works four ceremonies: the exaltation ceremony to bring in new members and an installation ceremony for each of the three Principals.Statement of ruling Grand Chapter on its official website here. In England and Wales, a Holy Royal Arch Chapter is required to be sponsored by a Craft lodge and bears the same number. In nearly all cases, a Holy Royal Arch Chapter also bears the same name as its sponsoring Craft lodge, although the Holy Royal Arch itself is a separate order from Craft Freemasonry. At the same time, the Holy Royal Arch is the only appendant order that is actively endorsed by the United Grand Lodge of England among Craft freemasons. Craft lodges in England and Wales normally have a specially appointed Royal Arch Representative, and newly raised Master Masons are actively encouraged to seek exaltation into the Holy Royal Arch before considering membership of any further Masonic organisation. With the exception of Scotland and Scandinavia (where Swedish rite is used), the English system of Royal Arch Masonry is also found in other European states, as well as in Australasia, and is currently being introduced to many eastern European states, including Russia and Serbia.See statements at this webpage, for example. Due to the difference in organisation, notable restrictions apply to English members of the Royal Arch who wish to attend Royal Arch meetings in Scotland (see below). =Scotland= In Scotland, the degree is conferred in a Royal Arch Chapter which is organised within a wholly different administrative structure, the \\"Supreme Grand Royal Arch Chapter of Scotland\\". This body administers Mark Masonry, Royal Arch Masonry, and the degree of Excellent Master which is an essential preamble to the Royal Arch degree. English Royal Arch Masons will not be allowed into a Scottish chapter during a Mark working, unless they also hold that degree, which in England is administered by a separate body. The degree does not exist in England, and members of the English Grand Chapter are not permitted to attend these workings. They may also be excluded from part of the Royal Arch working which they no longer use, although this is at the discretion of individual chapters. These restrictions do not apply to members of Royal Arch chapters in Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and North America. The position of the Bristol chapters, which re-assimilated \\"Passing the Veils\\" (similar to the Excellent Masters working), is unclear. =Ireland= The Royal Arch degree under the Irish Constitution is unique, and while perfectly regular and recognised, it bears little resemblance to the same degree in the sister Constitutions of England and Scotland. The Royal Arch Degree under the Irish Constitution contains a legend based on the renovation of the First Temple under King Josiah, not the rebuilding of the second. The legend in this form has been worked under the Irish Constitution since 1864. The elaborate \\"Passing of the Veils\\" ceremony is essential to the Royal Arch Degree in the Irish system and after it is completed it is followed immediately by the Royal Arch degree itself, containing the story of the restoration of Solomon's Temple under King Josiah. The three presiding officers of a Royal Arch Chapter in Ireland are called the Excellent King, High Priest and Chief Scribe (not First, Second and Third Principal as in England and Wales). The Sojourners and Scribes were replaced by the 'Royal Arch Captain', the 'Captain of the Scarlet Veil', the 'Captain of the Purple Veil' and the 'Captain of the Blue Veil'.Royal Arch Chapter of Research No. 222 Robert J. W. Harvey, Royal Arch Masonry in Ireland in the Early 19th Century, The Lodge of Research No. CC: Transactions for the years 1969 ‚Äì 1975, Volume XVI, retrieved 8 October 2012 Although not referred to as such in the ritual, the three principals are taken to be King Josiah, the High Priest Hilkiah and the scribe Shaphan.Pietre Stones Arturo de Hoyos, The Mistery of the Royal Arch Word, Heredom, vol 2, 1993 Irish Royal Arch Chapters are also permitted to meet as Lodges of Mark Master Masons, and these are governed by the Supreme Grand Royal Arch Chapter of Ireland. =Northern Europe= The Swedish rite Freemasonry which is practiced in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland and partly in Finland and Germany is a truly progressive system, divided into three divisions. The second division, the St. Andrews Lodge, has some similarities to Royal Arch, and VI degree masons under Swedish rite and Royal Arch masons share some symbolism and will have a common understanding. =North America and other countries= In the United States, Canada, Brazil, Israel, Mexico, Paraguay, Philippines (and others), the teachings of Royal Arch Masonry are not worked as a stand-alone degree, but form part of the York Rite system of additional Masonic degrees. Royal Arch Chapters of the York Rite administer the degrees of 'Mark Master Mason', 'Virtual Past Master', 'Most Excellent Master' and 'Royal Arch Mason'. Of these four degrees, only the latter bears resemblance to the Supreme Order of the Holy Royal Arch as practised in England and Wales. In Canada, most jurisdictions do not formally practice or confer the degree of 'Virtual Past Master', although it is known to be made available as a group ceremony for members attending a Grand Chapter Convocation. Administrative structure =Chapter level= Once accepted into a Chapter, the Holy Royal Arch equivalent of a Craft lodge, a candidate becomes a Companion, with Royal Arch meetings being described as a convocation. The ceremony in which a Master Mason is advanced to Companion is called Exaltation. Holy Royal Arch Chapters are governed by three Principals, who conjointly rule the Chapter, sitting together in the east of the assembly. In addition to the three Principals, who rule conjointly, a Holy Royal Arch Chapter has elected and appointed officers with individual responsibilities within the Chapter. Similar offices exist at the Supreme Grand Chapter (national) level, and also at the intermediate level (Metropolitan, Provincial, or District), with appropriate prefixes to the titles. *Zerubbabel - Prince of Jerusalem *Haggai - the Prophet *Joshua or Jeshua - the High Priest *Scribe Ezra *Scribe Nehemiah *Treasurer *Director of Ceremonies *Principal Sojourner *1st Assistant Sojourner *2nd Assistant Sojourner *Assistant Director of Ceremonies *Organist *Steward (there may be several Stewards) *Janitor All of these offices are listed in, and regulated by, the constitutions or regulations of the various national Grand Chapters, including those of the 'mother' Grand Chapter, the Supreme Grand Chapter of England.Regulations of the Supreme Grand Chapter of England, with the Grand Officers listed on pages 202 and 203, and officers of private Chapters listed on page 232. Within the 'York Rite' version of Royal Arch Freemasonry the Janitor may be known as the Tyler or Sentinel. In Scotland, the Principal and Assistant Sojourners are replaced by 1st Sojourner, 2nd Sojourner and 3rd Sojourner. The 3rd Sojourner acts rather like the Inner/Inside Guard of a Craft Lodge. It is usual for the 3rd Principal (Joshua) to work the affiliation to the Mark Lodge within the Chapter, and the 3rd Principal (Haggai) to work the Excellent Master Degree. Similarly, in some Scottish Chapters, the 2nd Sojourner will conduct the candidate through the Excellent Master Degree, whilst the 1st Sojourner conducts the candidate through the Royal Arch Degree. If the Mark Degree is worked in a Chapter, it is often the Craft Lodge office-bearers (who are Royal Arch Masons) who take their usual lodge role, since they are most used to it. =Regional level= In England and Wales, Holy Royal Arch Chapters are grouped on a regional level as either a 'Metropolitan area' or 'Provinces' (based on the old Counties), while Chapters overseas are grouped in Districts. These Metropolitan, Provincial, and District Grand Chapters are ruled over by a 'Grand Superintendent' who is appointed by the 'First Grand Principal' (see below) as his personal representative for the particular area. Every 'Grand Superintendent' is usually assisted by a Deputy, and always rules conjointly with a 'Second Provincial Grand Principal' and a 'Third Provincial Grand Principal' (the word 'Provincial' being replaced with the word 'Metropolitan' in a Metropolitan Area such as London, or the word 'District' in an overseas area controlled from England). In many cases, the men acting as regional dignitaries in the Holy Royal Arch will also be holding the equivalent regional offices in Craft Freemasonry. =Supreme Grand Chapter= The Supreme Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of England is governed from the headquarters of the United Grand Lodge of England in Freemasons' Hall, London. The Supreme Grand Chapter is ruled by three Grand Principals, who have their headquarters . The 'First Grand Principal' is the Holy Royal Arch equivalent of the Grand Master in Craft Freemasonry. If the holder of this office is a Royal Prince, as is currently the case, he is supported by a 'Pro First Grand Principal'. As at regional level, many officers of Grand Lodge hold the equivalent office in the Supreme Grand Chapter.

History The aqueduct was built to a design by Hugh Baird, with advice from Thomas Telford, in tandem with the Slateford Aqueduct and Avon Aqueduct, with which it shares its design. Baird had originally proposed to have only a single span, with embankments carrying the canal the rest of the way, but eventually decided to use the same design as the other two aqueducts. Telford was not convinced that the stone arches were necessary in conjunction with the iron trough, but Baird used both on all three major aqueducts. Construction was carried out by Messrs. Craven, Whitaker and Nowell between 1819 and 1821, their success in building a stone bridge over the River Ouse making their tender for the contract \\"by far the most eligible.\\" In 1970 it was designated as a scheduled monument and in 1971 it was given Category A status, being individually listed for each local authority (the river denotes the boundary between West Lothian and Edinburgh). In 2003 the Union Canal became a scheduled monument thus causing the aqueduct to be scheduled twice and leading to the original designation being removed in 2019. Design The Barton Aqueduct of 1761, and subsequent canal aqueducts in the United Kingdom, used large quantities of masonry and puddling to obtain watertightness. After the success of The Iron Bridge in 1789, however, cast iron was used by Telford on aqueducts such as Chirk and Pontcysyllte. Aqueducts built in the early part of the 19th century use either puddle clay or an iron trough in no particular pattern. The Almond Aqueduct uses an iron trough to achieve watertightness, as well as containing the outward pressure of the water, allowing it to be of more slender construction than a purely stone aqueduct such as the Kelvin Aqueduct. Measuring long, it carries the Union Canal above the River Almond, from Edinburgh into West Lothian. A sluice into the Almond allows regulation of the water level in the canal, and near to the aqueduct is a feeder from Cobbinshaw Reservoir. The aqueduct can be reached by car by way of a track and by walkers and cyclists on the Union Canal towpath.

It is mainly a residential district. Many mansions were built there in the Ottoman period. From the 6th century, the port of √áengelk√∂y was called Sophianai because of the palace Justin II built nearby for his consort Sophia.Eyice (1976), pages 55-56. The name √áengelk√∂y means \\"hook village\\" and indeed the village is nestled around a sharp turn of the Bosphorus shoreline, but the origin of the name is uncertain. One story put forward is that the village is named after the 19th-century Ottoman admiral √áengeloƒülu Tahir Pasha, who had a waterside mansion built there (and there is a √áengeloƒülu Street in √áengelk√∂y). Another story derives the name from the Persian word √ßenkar, \\"crab,\\" because of the abundance of seafood in the Bosphorus there.H√ºrel (2008), page 107. A 16th-century Ottoman document apparently refers to the place as \\"√áenger k√∂y√º.\\"Eyice (1976), page 56. √áengelk√∂y is world-famous for the small cucumbers once grown there (now grown in Kandƒ±ra).

Taijiquan Yongfa Tujie, Taipei, Hua Lian Publishing Co., August, 1984 (original in spring, 1933), pg. 2 under the supervision of his father, Yang Jianhou. During the initial years of Zhang‚Äôs training with Chengfu, he was only taught the publicly known elements of the Yang style disseminated to students outside the Yang family. After Zhang successful fought a challenge match against a famous martial artist from southern China, Wan Mou, the elder Yang decided the young student had earned the right to learn the Yangjia Michuan teachings. Thereafter, Jianhou had Zhang report to his personal quarters every night between the hours of 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. while the rest of the compound slept. It was then that Jianhou taught Zhang the Yangjia Michuan Taiji Quan system in addition to his regular daily training.Tomarchio, Sam. \\"Wang Yen-nien Talks about Zhang Qinlin. \\" AYMTA Journal, Volume 3, NO. 2, FALL 1995.

Each province was to send two participants ‚Äì one for the armed division, one for the unarmed division‚Äîto Nanjing, the then capitol of China, to compete. Zhang, whose occupation as a fur merchant had required that he move to Shanxi in 1925, entered and won the regional competition for that province.

Origins The term is first attested in a poem attributed to the 14th-century , in which the principal character gets perilously but comically lost while going to visit his girlfriend: \\"\\" (\\"(The) weak enchantment (now) flees, / (the) long burden of the Tylwyth Teg (departs) into the mist\\"). Attributes In later sources the are described as fair-haired and covet golden-haired human children whom they kidnap, leaving changelings (or , ) in their place. They dance and make fairy rings and they live underground or under the water. They bestow riches on those they favour but these gifts vanish if they are spoken of, and fairy maidens may become the wives of human men. These fairy wives are however still bound by traditional taboos. They must be careful to avoid touching iron or they will vanish back to their realm never to be seen by their husbands again. As the they are sometimes described as stunted and ugly. They ride horses in fairy rades (processions) and visit houses where bowls of milk are customarily put out for them. A changeling story tells of a woman whose three-year-old son was stolen by the fairies and she was given a threefold instruction by a \\"cunning man\\" (magician) on how to get him back. She removed the top from a raw egg and began stirring the contents, and as the changeling watched her do this certain comments he made established his otherworldly identity. She then went to a crossroads at midnight during the full moon and observed a fairy rade in order to confirm that her son was with them. Lastly she obtained a black hen and without plucking it she roasted it over a wood fire until every feather dropped off. The changeling then disappeared and her son was returned to her. According to the folklorist Wirt Sikes the may be divided into five general types: the (elves), the (fairies of the mines), the (household fairies similar to brownies), the (female fairies of the lakes and streams) and the (mountain fairies more akin to hags). The (singular ) inhabit groves and valleys and are similar to English elves. Their food consists of toadstools and fairy butter (a type of fungus) and they wear digitalis bell flowers as gloves.

Gender studies centers on interdisciplinary research on the phenomenon of gender. It focuses on cultural representations of gender and people's lived experience. Jewish studies is a field that looks at Jews and Judaism, through such disciplines as history, anthropology, literary studies, linguistics, and sociology. History Jewish law, or halacha, recognises gender ambiguity, and has done so throughout Jewish history.\\"More than Just Male and Female: The Six Genders in Ancient Jewish Thought.\\" Freidson, Sarah. Sefaria, 10 June 2016. However, unlike the modern concept of gender identity, this ambiguity is defined according to physical presentation (or lack thereof) and primary and secondary sexual characteristics. The concept of a Tumtum being a person of ambiguous gender and/or sex is dealt with, as is the concept of the androgynos, being a person characterised with elements of both genders. These concepts have precedent dating back to the beginning of Jewish thought. Gender and Judaism has drawn scholarly interest due to the rapid growth of its intersecting fields during the late 20th century, fueled as well by popular and academic attention to Jewish feminism. As universities established women's studies programs, they have linked to Jewish studies as well. For instance, in 1997, Brandeis University established the Hadassah-Brandeis Institute, which aims to \\"develop fresh ways of thinking about Jews and gender worldwide by producing and promoting scholarly research and artistic projects.\\" In addition, controversies over the role of women in Jewish denominations and the gender separation in orthodox Judaism has drawn attention to gender roles, as constructed and regulated by religious institutions. For this reason, besides the academic attention, the liberal Jewish movements turn to gender and Judaism to reinforce their own mission and identity. Notably, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College has established the Gottesman Chair in Gender and Judaism and operates Kolot ‚Äî the Center for Jewish Women's and Gender Studies \\", the first such center established at a rabbinical seminary (1996).

Scope Gender and Jewish studies intersect primarily through research on Jewish women and the role of women in Judaism and Jewish culture. Nonetheless, gender and Jewish studies also investigate the gender phenomena pertaining to men and masculinity. In addition, the subfield encompasses research on homosexuality and queer theory as these pertain to Jews and Judaism. In historical terms, gender and Jewish studies span a broad range, from Biblical exegesis, research on rabbinic literature, Medieval Jewish culture, the importance of gender in Jewish responses to modernity, and gender identity politics in the contemporary period. There is a growing subfield in the study of gender and Judaism, which sees the binaries of male and female as crucial constructs in Jewish thought.Kosman, Miriam, Circle, Arrow, Spiral, Exploring Gender in Judaism, Menucha Publishers, 2014.Steven F. Friedell, ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòDifferent Voice‚Äô in Jewish Law: Some Parallels to a Feminist Jurisprudence,‚Äù Indiana Law Journal, October 1992.Neusner, Jacob, 'Androgynous Judaism: Masculine and Feminine in the Dual Torah,' Wipf and Stock Publishers, 1993. While the male/female dialectic first makes its appearance in the story of creation, the Talmud insists that the idea of male and female extends way beyond sex roles: \\"Everything that God created, He created as male and female....\\"(Baba Batra 74b) This dialectic takes on even greater theological significance in light of the Biblical book, Song of Songs, which has been traditionally interpreted as a metaphor for the relationship between God and the Nation of Israel, where the Nation of Israel is cast as feminine towards God, who is represented in the story by the male lover. Other examples of topics in which the male/female dynamic is used metaphorically include: the relationship between Shabbat and the days of the week,Kosman, Miriam, Men are From Weekday, Women are from Shabbat, 2016 the relationship between the Oral and Written Law, the relationship between This World and the Next, the interplay between the legal and extra-legal aspects of Talmud (Halacha and Aggada),Neusner, Jacob, How the Rabbis Liberated Women, University of South Florida, 1998. and the Jewish calendar, which makes use of both the sun (traditionally symbolic of the male force) and the moon (traditionally symbolic of the female force).Heshelis, Devorah, The Moon's Lost Light, Targum Press, 2004 Gender polarity is robustly maintained in both the Bible and in the Oral Law, (Deuteronomy, 22:5, even forbids cross-dressing) and upholding this polarity is seen as critical in achieving synthesis between the masculine and feminine. This exploration of gender-constructs in primary sources reveals surprising valuation of the feminine prototype in Kabbala-based sources which invites inquiry into the social, ethical, ecological, moral and philosophical ramifications of a feminine perspective within Jewish thought.Rinder Sarah, \\"A New, Sophisticated, Haredi View on Gender\\" The Forward, November 24, 2015 See also *Gender separation in Judaism *Jewish feminism *Women in Judaism *Kate Bornstein, gender theorist raised Conservative *Daniel Boyarin, gender and Talmudic culture scholar *Judith Butler, gender theorist and a self- described anti-Zionist Jewish American *Nice Jewish boy, on masculinity * Elana Maryles Sztokman, Jewish feminist author and thought-leader * Jay Michaelson, queer theorist and Kabbalist. *Shulamith Firestone, radical feminist theorist raised Orthodox * Miriam Kosman, Orthodox Jewish scholar and author on gender and Judaism * Kalonymus ben Kalonymus * Devorah Heshelis, Orthodox author about women's status in Judaism  References  External links * History of Beckerman Kolot collection on gender and Judaism at RRC, by librarian D.

Its title could be translated into English as Harlequin, refined by love. Arlequin poli par l'amour was first performed October 17, 1720 by the Com√©die Italienne. In this play, a fairy tries to force Arlequin to fall in love with her. Instead, Arlequin falls in love with Silvia, a shepherdess. With the help of the fairy's servant Trivelin, the two manage to trick the fairy and live happily ever after. Its plot and comedic features were strongly influenced by the traditional Italian theatre of the Commedia dell'arte. Arlequin and Trivelin are stock characters of the Commedia dell'arte, and Silvia is a name associated with the female romantic lead. Marivaux makes use of several traditional lazzi as well. For example, near the beginning of the play, Arlequin tries to catch invisible flies while the fairy is trying to have a serious conversation with him. At the end, Arlequin uses the fairy's magic wand to beat all of the characters on stage. (Arlequin and his baton are the origin of the term \\"slapstick\\".) Plot summary Illustration by Bertall Having transported a sleeping Arlequin to her island, the fairy waits for him to wake up. Her servant, Trivelin, questions her devotion to the young man who is too lazy, too gourmand, and too simple to be worthy of her love. Moreover, he reminds the fairy that she is engaged to Merlin, a powerful sorcerer, and breaking the engagement could have serious consequences. When Arlequin wakes up, the fairy indulges him with romantic entertainment, but he is more concerned with a ring she wears on her finger and being fed. Arlequin, having left the fairy's palace, stumbles upon Silvia in the forest, and the two of them fall instantly in love. Silvia gives Arlequin her handkerchief, and they agree to meet later on that evening. Back at the palace, the fairy's suspicions are aroused when Arlequin suddenly begins showing manners and acting civilized; and when she spies the handkerchief, she assumes the transformation has occurred because of love. She follows him into the forest and catches Arlequin and Silvia together. She separates the lovers and forces Silvia to tell Arlequin that she is really engaged to a shepherd from the village; the fairy also sends Trivelin to spy on them to make sure that Silvia does not disobey. Upon hearing Silvia's lie, Arlequin threatens to kill himself. Silvia tells him the truth about the fairy's demands; and Trivelin reveals himself to the couple. However, Trivelin takes pity on Arlequin and Silvia and gives them advice on how to trick the fairy. Arlequin then pretends to reject Silvia and returns to the fairy. When he is close enough, he steals the fairy's magic wand and forces her to become his servant. Arlequin and Silvia decide to get married.

Overview This book is a business novella using magic as a metaphor to change the readers‚Äô behavior and empower the reader to think out of the box. The author believes that Innovation begins by challenging assumptions. The term, Follow the Other Hand, is derived from a sleight of hand magic trick that reminds people that what they assume to be true is actually a belief. And if they follow that belief they will be misdirected such as in magic. But if they challenge the assumption; in essence, follow the other hand, they will find the secret or a new business solution that did not exist before. The book uses lessons instead of chapters. Each lesson ends with instructions for a magic trick supporting the premise of that lesson. Case Histories The book includes business case histories of companies large and small that challenge the assumptions of their competitors to create successful products and services. Case histories include: Axe (Lynx), a body spray, manufactured by Unilever; OnStar, a telematic service from GM, Build-A-Bear Workshop, a retail operation created by Maxine Clark, Proofreadnow.com, an innovative online service, M&Ms;, a confectionery manufactured by Mars, Incorporated, Jones Soda, a soft drink manufacturer and Crest Spinbrush, a packaged good products created from a partnership between John Osher and Procter & Gamble.

Enclosed between these mountains there are dispersed groups of conifers in mid and high elevations valleys when rainfall conditions allow their growth. Mexican conifers grow in some places often associated with oaks. The dry season is about 7‚Äì8 months. Most rainfall (80-95%) occurs from June to October (5 months) and for only four months in the north. Precipitation throughout the year is present only in a little portion of the Sierra Madre Oriental in the State of Veracruz. The greatest number of species belong to the Pinus genus, including about 60 species and subspecies. Mexican conifers growing in subtropical climates include Pinus chiapensis, Pinus oocarpa, and pinus tecunumanii. Mexican conifers in temperate-to-cool climates are as follow: * Pinus ayacahuite * Pinus cembroides * Pinus durangensis * Pinus engelmanii * Pinus greggii * Pinus hartwegii * Pinus leiophylla * Pinus lumholtzii * Pinus devoniana * Pinus montezumae * Pinus nelsonii * Pinus oocarpa var. trifoliata * Pinus patula * Pinus pseudostrobus * Pinus teocote * Taxodium mucronatum * Abies religiosa * Cupressus lusitanica Mexican conifers that grow in exclusively in cool climates are Pinus hartwegii and Pinus rudis.  Cultivation and uses  Pinus devoniana at Hackfalls Arboretum, New Zealand Some of the trees are harvested locally for their wood, which is used mainly in boards, construction, rustic furniture and in paper production. Resin is extracted from some species. Some trees are esteemed for their seeds: Pinus nelsonii, Pinus maximartinezii, Pinus cembroides and Pinus orizabenzis. Mexican conifers have been recently started to be introduced in different parts around the world, and their plantations are considered very important. The leading reason for that expansion is the good quality that their wood has for paper production, but they are also planted as ornamental due to their unique characteristics and as exotic plants. The main genera used with this purposes are pines, cypresses and firs and taxodiums. In their natural environment, they grow from 30¬∞ to 14¬∞ North Latitude, at altitudes between 600 and 4300 meters above sea level. There are some advantages for their introduction in several places in different altitudes, latitudes and climates: The average rainfall in regions where they occur fluctuates between 380 and 2000 millimeters a year. Above 2400 meters' elevation, snowfall is usual. Moist conditions vary from a short season of rainfall in summer to a climate with rainfall throughout the year, and can develop from semiarid to very wet conditions. In general they can withstand dry summers and some of are drought tolerant in several degrees. They grow from subtropical to cool climates; the average temperature varies from 24 ¬∞C to 10 ¬∞C.

The gatehouse is a Grade I listed building. Tixall was used as a prison for Mary, Queen of Scots for two weeks in 1586. History The manor of Tixall was held for many years by the Littleton family until 1507 when the Littleton heiress married Sir John Aston. The medieval manor house was replaced by Sir Edward Aston, High Sheriff of Staffordshire, in about 1555 and the Gatehouse was added in about 1580. The Gatehouse is a three-storey rectangular structure, the balustraded facade of which is decorated with three orders of twinned columns. There are four octagonal corner turrets topped with cupolas and weather vanes. Lords Aston of Forfar. The false witness Stephen Dugdale alleged that it was one of the meeting places of the supposed conspirators of the Popish Plot (c 1680 ). The Astons were later raised to the baronetage and to the peerage, with the title Lord Aston of Forfar.The Scots Peerage, Vol. I, Sir Robert Douglas, ed. James Balfour Paul, David Douglas, Edinburgh, 1904. Walter Aston, 2nd Lord Aston of Forfar became a recusant Catholic. After his death it was alleged, as part of the bogus accusations in the Popish Plot, that he received Jesuits at Tixall, and in August and September 1677 held meetings at Tixall attended by William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford and Aston's steward Stephen Dugdale where the assassination of Charles II was plotted.Dugdale, Stephen, Information of Stephen Dugdale delivered at the House of Commons, November, 1680, London (1680): Tryal of William Viscount Stafford for high treason, London (1681) Amidst the Popish Plot allegations, one contemporary witness, William Skelton, described finding Dugdale and Stafford talking alone together in the Little Parlour and the Great Parlour (a dining-room next to Aston's chamber) at Tixall in September 1678.

Viscount Stafford, London (1681) On the death of the sixth Lord Aston the estate passed to his sister, who had married Thomas Clifford (see Clifford-Constable baronets). Clifford replaced the old house with a new mansion in about 1780 but retained the Tudor Gatehouse.

The Hall itself was demolished in 1927, leaving only the Gatehouse standing, and the estate was broken up when sold off piecemeal in 1960.

Paulet thought the house was suitable but argued it would be a pity to make Sir Walter Aston and his household of 100 persons move out, as his high standing and religion was good for the region. Aston argued that the move would disturb his farming and he would be forced to sell his sixty cattle and his plough oxen.Morris, John, ed., Letter Book of Amias Paulet (1874), pp 98-102; Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.8 (1914), p 113 (extracts only) On 11 August 1586, the English authorities decided to act on the Babington plot.

It serves the Greenbush Line. The station, located at 777 Country Way in North Scituate village, is the primary station for Scituate, while nearby Greenbush station primarily serves as a park-and-ride for adjacent communities. Like the other stations on the Greenbush Line, North Scituate consists of a single full-length high-level platform which provides accessible boarding to the line's single track. History North Scituate station on a 1912 postcard 1909-built station in 2013 =South Shore Railroad= The modern Greenbush Line was originally built as the South Shore Railroad, which opened to Cohasset in 1849. The Old Colony-backed Duxbury and Cohasset Railroad, chartered in 1867, which opened from Cohasset to Duxbury in 1871, including a stop at North Scituate. Three other stations were, at various times, located in Scituate: Egypt station at Captain Pierce Road, Scituate (also called Scituate Harbor) at First Parish Road, and Greenbush at Driftway. After financial troubles in the 1870s, the Duxbury and Cohasset was joined with the South Shore under the fold of the Old Colony Railroad in 1877. The Old Colony was leased to the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad in 1893. =New Haven Railroad= Ridership on the Greenbush Line diminished in the 1930s due to increased competition from automobiles. The line enjoyed a brief uptick in traffic in World War II with the construction of the Hingham Naval Ammunition Depot and the Hingham Naval Ammunition Depot Annex. The number of daily trips was increased from 4 to 8 after World War II under Frederick C. Dumaine, Jr., and modern diesel trains including Budd RDCs were introduced in the 1950s. However, the New Haven Railroad continued to lose money on the service, and after Dumaine was ousted the railroad announced all trains would cease running in 1958. Only an emergency subsidy by the state kept trains running until June 30, 1959 when the Southeast Expressway opened and all passenger train service ended. The former Spanish-style station, built in 1908-09, is located on Gannett Road near the modern station. It has been converted for commercial use. =MBTA era= Calls for the former Old Colony lines to be reactivated began in the 1980s; the Plymouth/Kingston Line and Middleborough/Lakeville Line were reopened in 1997. After much controversy surrounding various aspects of the $534 million project, construction of the Greenbush Line was completed in mid-2007. The Greenbush line and North Scituate station were opened for full service on October 31, 2007 after a ceremonial train the previous day.

After work from Paul Greengard's lab had suggested that dopamine receptors were the site of action of antipsychotic drugs, several groups (including those of Solomon Snyder and Philip Seeman) used a radiolabeled antipsychotic drug to identify what is now known as the dopamine D2 receptor. The dopamine D2 receptor is the main receptor for most antipsychotic drugs. The structure of DRD2 in complex with the atypical antipsychotic risperidone has been determined.  Function  This gene encodes the D2 subtype of the dopamine receptor, which is coupled to Gi subtype of G protein-coupled receptor. This G protein-coupled receptor inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity. In mice, regulation of D2R surface expression by the neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) in the dentate gyrus is involved in exploration, synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Studies have shown potential roles for D2R in retrieval of fear memories in the prelimbic cortex and in discrimination learning in the nucleus accumbens. In flies, activation of the D2 autoreceptor protected dopamine neurons from cell death induced by MPP+, a toxin mimicking Parkinson's disease pathology. While optimal dopamine levels favor D1R cognitive stabilization, it is the D2R that mediates the cognitive flexibility in humans.  Isoforms  Alternative splicing of this gene results in three transcript variants encoding different isoforms. The long form (D2Lh) has the \\"canonical\\" sequence and functions as a classic post-synaptic receptor. The short form (D2Sh) is pre-synaptic and functions as an autoreceptor that regulates the levels of dopamine in the synaptic cleft. Agonism of D2sh receptors inhibits dopamine release; antagonism increases dopaminergic release. A third D2(Longer) form differs from the canonical sequence where 270V is replaced by VVQ.  Active (D2HighR) and inactive (D2LowR) forms  D2R conformers are equilibrated between two full active (D2HighR) and inactive (D2LowR) states, while in complex with an agonist and antagonist ligand, respectively. The monomeric inactive conformer of D2R in binding with risperidone was reported in 2018 (PDB ID: 6CM4). However, the active form which is generally bound to an agonist, is not available yet and in most of the studies the Homology modeling of the structure is implemented. The difference between the active and inactive of G protein-coupled receptor is mainly observed as conformational changes at the cytoplasmic half of the structure, particularly at the transmembrane domains (TM) 5 and 6. The conformational transitions occurred at the cytoplasmic ends are due to the coupling of G protein to the cytoplasmic loop between the TM 5 and 6. It was observed that either D2R agonist or antagonist ligands revealed better binding affinities inside the ligand-binding domain of the active D2R in comparison with the inactive state. It demonstrated that ligand-binding domain of D2R is affected by the conformational changes occurring at the cytoplasmic domains of the TM 5 and 6. In consequence, the D2R activation reflects a positive cooperation on the ligand-binding domain. In drug discovery studies in order to calculate the binding affinities of the D2R ligands inside the binding domain, it's important to work on which form of D2R. It's known that the full active and inactive states are recommended to be used for the agonist and antagonist studies, respectively. Any disordering in equilibration of D2R states, which causes problems in signal transferring between the nervous systems, may lead to diverse serious disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism and Parkinson's disease. In order to control these disorders, equilibration between the D2R states is controlled by implementing of agonist and antagonist D2R ligands. In most cases, it was observed that the problems regarding the D2R states may have genetic roots and are controlled by drug therapies. So far, there is no any certain treatment for these mental disorders.  Allosteric pocket and orthosteric pocket  There are orthosteric binding site (OBS) and a secondary binding pocket (SBP) in dopamin 2 receptor, and interaction with the SBP is a requirement for allosteric pharmacology. The compound SB269652 is a negative allosteric modulator of the D2R.  Oligomerization of D2R  It was observed that D2R exists in dimeric forms or higher order oligomers. There are some experimental and molecular modeling evidences that demonstrated the D2R monomers cross link from their TM 4 and TM 5 to form dimeric conformers. Oligomerization of D2R has a main role in their biological activities and any disordering in it may lead to mental diseases. It's known that the D2R ligands (either the agonist or antagonist) binding to the ligand-binding domain of D2R are independent of oligomerization and can not have any effect on its process, so the drugs used for the treatment of mental diseases can't cause any main problem in oligomerization of D2R. Since the process of oligomerization of D2R in human bodies and their links to the mental diseases were not explicitly studied, there is no any treatment reported for the disorders originates from oligomerization's problems. The oligomerization of GPCRs is a controversial topic that there are many unknown problems on this area yet. There's not any crystallographic data available describing the crosslinking of monomers. There are some evidences suggesting that GPCRs monomers crosslinking domains are different and dependent to the biological environments and other factors.  Genetics  Allelic variants: * A-241G * C132T, G423A, T765C, C939T, C957T, and G1101A * Cys311Ser * -141C insertion/deletion The polymorphisms have been investigated with respect to association with schizophrenia. Some researchers have previously associated the polymorphism Taq 1A (rs1800497) to the DRD2 gene. However, the polymorphism resides in exon 8 of the ANKK1 gene. DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism has been reported to be associated with an increased risk for developing motor fluctuations but not hallucinations in Parkinson's disease. A splice variant in Dopamine receptor D2(rs1076560) was found to be associated with limb truncal Tardive dyskinesia and diminished expression factor of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) in schizophrenia subjects.  Ligands  Most of the older antipsychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol are antagonists for the dopamine D2 receptor, but are, in general, very unselective, at best selective only for the \\"D2-like family\\" receptors and so binding to D2, D3 and D4, and often also to many other receptors such as those for serotonin and histamine, resulting in a range of side-effects and making them poor agents for scientific research. In similar manner, older dopamine agonists used for Parkinson's disease such as bromocriptine and cabergoline are poorly selective for one dopamine receptor over another, and, although most of these agents do act as D2 agonists, they affect other subtypes as well.

The Edwardian semi-detached house and its contents have remained largely unchanged since the 1920s. It opened to the public in 1993. History The Edwardian semi-detached house built around 1905 and located on Blyth Grove in Worksop, was the residence of the Straw family and is now cared for by the National Trust. William Straw moved to the town in 1886 with his brother Benjamin and the two siblings established a successful grocers shop at 130 Bridge Street. The business, marketed as a tea dealer and seedsman as well as grocers, did well for itself, and on 15 September 1896, in Worksop Priory Church, William married Florence Ann Winks, daughter of the prosperous butcher and later councillor David Wall Winks, who owned the butchers across the street from the Straw's Grocery Shop. Having bought out his brother Benjamin in 1889, William was solely responsible for the business, living above the shop with Florence and their three sons, William (Jr) (1898), Walter (1899) and David (1901), who died at around eighteen months old in 1903. It wasn't until 1923 that the family moved out to their new house on Blyth Grove and Florence quickly got to work on the decoration of her new home, choosing the latest wallpapers and carpets to create a fashionable and modern place for entertaining and relaxing. After living at the shop for so long the move to a separate family home was the chance to show off the success of the business. After the death of her husband in 1932 Florence made few alterations to the house, as a Victorian woman in mourning this would have been expected of her and her contemporaries would have found nothing strange about her choice to keep his pipes by the fire and his collar box in the bedroom. When she died in 1939 William and Walter lived in the house together, and their frugal way of living and make do and mend attitude resulted in the house largely avoiding modernisation. William Jr had spent much of the 1920s and 1930s in London, initially studying English Literature at Kings College London before going on to teach at City of London College. Moving home in 1939 he took over the running of the house, while his brother ran the family business until his retirement in 1962. Neither brother married but they both had a variety of hobbies and interests, including archaeology and walking, and were involved in various local societies and their chosen place of worship, St John's. After Walter's death in 1976 William was alone until he died in 1990, the last few years of his life seeing him frequently in and out of hospital. When he died William generously left his collection of around 30,000 everyday objects to the National Trust, along with his money. The family home on Blyth Grove, and the other half of the semidetached property (which William had bought around 1940 and rented out) were left to the last set of tenants. Luckily the tenants sold to the National Trust, enabling the collection to stay in the house just as the Straw's lived with it, providing a fascinating glimpse into a forgotten time. National Trust ownership Though the Straw family took good care of their home William was unable to keep on top of the upkeep in his later years and the time when the property was uninhabited at the end of William's life, saw the cold and damp have an inevitable effect on the property. With these issues resolved and the house rewired it was ready to receive visitors and the doors opened to the public in 1993. Due to the small scale of the property visits need to be booked in advance as there is a maximum group size of four. The house opens Tuesday through to Saturday, closing for its winter clean in November and reopening in March. There are various special events organised and the display room and tour change yearly.

Dick, a sequel to his first published science fiction short story, \\"Beyond Lies the Wub\\". The story continues the former's theme of immortality, although not focusing on a living Wub itself, but rather its fur. Plot Wub fur, so the story suggests, continues to live after the \\"death\\" of the Wub, and as such is highly prized owing to its postmortem production of a luxurious pelt that has numerous, albeit trivial, human applications. One such application is its use as a book cover by a Mars-based publisher who issues a new Latin volume of Lucretius' poem De Rerum Natura (On the Nature of Things). Lucretius's poem represents one of the best preserved ancient sources of the materialist philosophy known as Epicureanism, which espoused an ateleological metaphysical formula of atoms, randomness and determinism, an ethical doctrine promoting hedonism and, most notably for Dick's story, personal annihilation at death. Dick's story begins with the book publisher receiving numerous complaints by purchasers of the Wub covered volume of Lucretius. Numerous changes to essential passages in the text have been discovered; those originally advocating personal annihilation now suggest a postmortem eschatological state. Detective work by the publisher and his copyist reveals that non-Wub covered volumes did not experience similar amendments and furthermore that no amendments were made to the proofs sent to the printers. The remainder of the story provides a humorous and philosophically interesting counterpointing of the annihilatory statements in Lucretius' poem and the Wub fur that, somehow, amends it. The publisher continues to experiment with the nature of volumes bound in Wub fur, including the Bible, which demonstrates similar amendments to the Lucretius poem. In the end, the publisher decides to take the test one step further, following the messages in the modified passages to see if the Wub fur can preserve other items--including bodies--in the same way it preserves itself.

It is located off Chief Justice Cushing Highway (Route 3A) west of downtown Cohasset. The station was opened with the line on October 31, 2007, providing the first rail service to Cohasset since 1959. Cohasset station is fully accessible. History A postcard view of the former station in downtown Cohasset Whitney Spur Rail Trail near the station The South Shore Railroad opened as far to Cohasset on January 1, 1849. By 1878, the Old Colony Railroad controlled the entire line. The Old Colony and successor New Haven Railroad operated four stations in Cohasset: North Cohasset (at Hull Street), King Street, Cohasset (at Pleasant Street) and Beechwood (at Beechwood Street). No station was located at the modern site, which is between populated areas. However, it was the site of the junction with the Whitney Spur, which led to the Hingham Naval Ammunition Depot Annex (open from 1941-1962). The New Haven ended passenger services on Old Colony Division on July 30, 1959. After the closure of the Annex in 1962, it was acquired by the state Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) and converted to Wompatuck State Park beginning in 1969. In 2003, the DCR sold the land for the station and parking lot to the MBTA in exchange for the construction of a rail trail on the former rail spur. The station opened with the rest of the Greenbush Line on October 31, 2007. It was intended as a park- and-ride station, with a large parking lot but few pedestrian connections to neighborhoods. The Whitney Spur Rail Trail opened from the station to the park around the same time. However, a gate blocked access from the trail to the northwest section of the park, which still had several dangerous abandoned buildings. After years of requests, demolition of the buildings began in April 2014. The northwest section opened in November 2014 and the gate was removed. With the trail now serving as usable access to the park, 20 spaces in the station lot were dedicated for park users.

Even though the website of the Millennium Village Project is still active, the project ended with final evaluation in 2015 because it was initially scaled to progress for a decade from 2005. The project was divided into two phases, from 2004-2010 for the first phase and 2011-2015 for the second phase. In the first phase, the project was focused at the following five stations: Agriculture(seed and fertilizer support, farmer training and storage expansion, crop diversification,etc.), health (installation of mosquito nets, vaccine supply and pest control, etc.), Education (Construction of schools, installation of water supply, etc.), infrastructure (sanitation, roads, etc.), business development (micro-credit, cooperative training, etc.). Main focus in the second phase of the MVP was to successfully enhance, strengthen, and complete of the programs that have started in Phase 1. By improving access to clean water, primary education, basic health care, sanitation, and other science-based interventions such as improved seeds and fertilizer, Millennium Villages aims to ensure that communities living in extreme poverty have a real, sustainable opportunity to lift themselves out of the poverty trap. The first Millennium village was launched in 2005 in Sauri, Kenya. \\"This is a village that‚Äôs going to make history,\\" is how Millennium Villages founder Jeffrey Sachs described Sauri in The Diary of Angelina Jolie and Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa, a 2005 MTV documentary. \\"It‚Äôs a village that‚Äôs going to end extreme poverty.\\" Millennium Villages are divided into different types. There are the original core villages which include different agro-ecological zones covering 14 sites in 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including: Sauri and Dertu, Kenya; Koraro, Ethiopia; Mbola, Tanzania; Ruhiira, Uganda; Mayange, Rwanda; Mwandama and Gumulira, Malawi; Pampaida and Ikaram, Nigeria; Potou, Senegal; Tiby and Toya, Mali and Bonsaaso, Ghana.In total the Millennium Villages Project reaches nearly 500,000 people in these countries. There are additional Millennium Villages which are following the Millennium Village program but which are not directly supported through The Earth Institute at Columbia University. These additional villages are located in Liberia, Cambodia, Jordan, Mozambique, Haiti, Cameroon and Benin. The project was originally funded through a combination of World Bank loans and private contributions, including $50 million from George Soros. Initially designed with a timeline of five years, the project was extended to ten years to allow more time to reach the intended goals. In her 2013 book about the project, The Idealist: Jeffrey Sachs and the Quest to End Poverty, journalist Nina Munk quotes Sachs saying: \\"The main thing is to add another block of time to really get the income levels significantly raised.\\"  Expansion  In 2012, the UK's Department for International Development (DfID) committed $18.1m (¬£11.5m) over five years to fund a new Millennium Village in Ghana. On 13 August 2013, the Islamic Development Bank and the Earth Institute at Columbia University announced the expansion of an earlier partnership to work with African nations to support their efforts to end extreme poverty. Part of that partnership involved the Islamic Development Bank providing $104 million in interest-free loans to 8 countries towards ending extreme poverty, improving public health, and achieve more sustainable development. Of that sum, $29 million was to be used to scale-ups of the Millennium Villages Project in Mali, Senegal and Uganda. In July 2013, the Ugandan government announced it would scale up the Millennium Villages Project in the original region around the Ruhiira Millennium Village through $US 9.75 million of funding from the Islamic Development Bank. However, the promised scale-up has not yet taken place. In September 2013, the Rwandan government and the Millennium Villages Project announced a partnership to scale-up certain aspects of the Millennium Village approach, as part of Rwanda's Vision 2020 Umurenge Programme which addresses poverty nationwide. The Millennium Villages Project has provided lessons and techniques for Nigeria's development programs designed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.  Guiding Principles  * Promote sustainable, scalable, community-led progress toward the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals through the use of scientifically validated interventions‚Äîone village at a time * Ensure African ownership of the Millennium Development Goals, and work in partnership with African governments and regional groups * Increase capacity and community empowerment in Africa through training and knowledge sharing with local African governments, NGOs, and village communities. * Partner with the public and private sectors, innovative NGOs, universities and leading experts, and the international donor community throughout Africa and the world to continually improve and coordinate development strategies. * Transform rural sub-subsistence farming economies into small-scale enterprise development economies and promote diversified entrepreneurs  Financing  The Government of Japan (through its Human Security Trust Fund) and private philanthropic donors (through the Earth Institute at Columbia University) provided the financing for the first set of Millennium Villages, reaching some 60,000 people. A core aspect of the Millennium Villages is that the poverty- ending investments in agriculture, health, education, and infrastructure can be financed by donors at an incremental cost of just $60 per villager per year‚Äî$250,000 per village per year. The overhead costs of managing the project in each village is $50,000 per year. On a per-person basis, the total village cost of $120 per person includes: *$60 Donor funding through the Millennium Village program *$30 Local and national governments (this is most likely to include funding for interventions themselves and the provision of agricultural and health extension workers in the villages) *$20 Partner organizations (e.g., existing programs supported by official bilateral donors) and in-kind corporate giving (for example, Sumitomo Chemical Corporation recently agreed to donate insecticide-treated bednets for the Millennium Villages) *$10 Village members, typically through in-kind contributions of their time and expertise Critically, the external financing needs of $70 per capita are in line with the financial commitments made by the leaders of industrialized countries at the 2005 Summit in Gleneagles. G8 countries promised to raise their development assistance to Africa to the equivalent of $70 per capita by 2010.  Prospects for increasing village-based interventions  In a review of the project undertaken by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) crop yield increases of 85-350% were recorded as well as reductions in malaria incidence of over 50%. While agricultural surpluses are able to be channelled into school meals programmes, helping to increase enrolment, improvements in health status are reported to increase labour productivity. According to ODI policy conclusions, in order for wider scale, more sustainable implementation to be achieved, village projects need to identify shared goals, seeking evidence-based, cost-effective interventions by governments and implementing agencies. They will also need to focus on addressing upstream investments such as training facilities for front-line staff. Critics When compared to the Ekwendeni village of the Soils, Food and Healthy Communities (SFHC), the Millennium Villages obtain only similar achievements at far greater expense. This is a result of the Millennium Villages' use of artificial fertilizers and hybrids seeds (often of plants such as corn, which are not indigenous to the area). SFHC, on the other hand, uses diverse legume crops to improve soil health: \\"The SFHC research project attempts to improve child nutritional status, household food security and soil fertility through use of different legume options which can improve the quality and quantity of food available within the household as well as provide organic inputs to improve soil fertility.\\"Soils, Food, and Healthy Communities. Research Results (main page). http://soilandfood.org/research-results/ According to Rachel Bezner Kerr, use of fertilizers and genetically modified seeds leads to dependence of the farmers on expensive products being marketed by large industrial companies.Critics to millennium villages By contrast, the use of crop diversity to improve soil health is a low cost, and thus far more sustainable, solution. Note this comparison is only to one component of the Millennium Villages Project which works in many different sectors including agriculture, education, health, infrastructure and business development. Journalist Nina Munk followed the progress of a group of Millennium Villages for several years, and in her 2013 book The Idealist: Jeffrey Sachs and the Quest to End Poverty, she said a basic flaw of the Millennium Villages program is that it is developed by academics living far away from the subject areas and with a poor understanding of local cultures, who do things such as promoting growing maize among people who have not historically eaten it or building a short- lived livestock market when there was no local demand.Anna Maria Tremonti, \\"The Quest to End Poverty: Nina Munk\\", CBC Radio, 2013-09-10 But even in Ms. Munk's book teams of experts are described who are from the countries and regions who run the Millennium Villages on the ground. In addition, many notable academics and development experts who work for the project have a long history in working and living in Africa and other developing countries. The Millennium Villages describes itself as a community-led project that works with local leaders, regional officials and national governments in the decision-making process. Evaluations A rigorous evaluation of the MVP is impossible due to shortcomings in the project's evaluation design which include the \\"subjective choice of intervention sites, the subjective choice of comparison sites, the lack of baseline data on comparison sites, the small sample size, and the short time horizon\\". A self-published assessment comparing villages three years into the project to how they were initially estimated large impacts on health, agricultural yield, and a variety of other measures. As some of this may have been due to regional improvements unrelated to the MVP, an independent evaluation comparing the MV to surrounding areas finds the effects are much more modest. An additional independent evaluation found that while agricultural productivity increased, final household income was not increased by the MVP. In 2012, the MVP published an assessment in the Lancet showing \\"reductions in poverty, food insecurity, stunting, and malaria parasitaemia\\". Objections were raised to some of the conclusions in the assessment, and the authors were forced to correct them subsequently: calculations of the under-5 child mortality rate were flawed and withdrawn as the rate appears to have improved less in the MVP sites than in the surrounding regions.

The Tatra-Fatra Belt consists of Tatric alpine crystalline basement and its autochthonous sedimentary cover, over which the Subtatric nappes (Fatric and Hronic) were thrust.H√≥k, J., Kahan, ≈†., Aubrecht, R., 2001. Geol√≥gia Slovenska. Univerzita Komensk√©ho, Bratislava, 43 p. The name core mountains is derived from the structural element, resistant crystalline basement rocks, preserved in the core of horsts, often forming the highest peaks of the mountains.  Origin  The basement of the core mountains is formed by the Tatric Unit, which is composed of dominantly hercynian metamorphic and igneous rocks and locally also a sedimentary cover of various thickness. In the Paleozoic clastic and volcanoclastic sediments deposited in the area, but later during Hercynian orogeny, sediments were metamorphosed in the greenschist and amphibolite facies (forming large amount of paragneisses and amphibolites, only locally orthogneisses, phyllites and mica schists). Regional and contact metamorphism was induced also by intrusions of granites, which accompanied the Hercynian collision (generally in the Carboniferous). Basement rocks were later exposed due to erosion and at the end of the Paleozoic affected by marine transgression that lasted till the end of Mesozoic. During this period sedimentary rocks, known as Tatric cover units, deposited. They generally consists of clastic and carbonate rocks. thumbleftSchematic cross section through the core mountain: In the Upper Cretaceous area of Tatric Unit, was affected by Eo-Alpine of Alpine Orogeny, that caused movement of large masses of rocks to the North and Northeast. To the South of the Tatric area a 2 superficial nappes, so called Subtatric Nappes, were detached and thrust over the Tatric. These nappes are generally composed of limestone, marl, dolomite and less by sandstones and slates. The lower nappes is called Kr√≠≈æna Nappe (or the Fatric) and the upper is Choƒç Nappe (or the Hronic). Kr√≠≈æ≈àa Nappe is dominantly composed of rock, that were formed in the Zliechov basin. It was situated in the Fatric area between the Tatric and Veporic units. Fatric had the same basement as the Veporic unit and is considered as former northern part of Veporic, but later during the thrusting its substratum was consumed and subducted. Surface occurrences of Fatric basement remained only as a remnants in the northern part of Veporic Veƒæk√Ω Bok Unit and few other areas. Choƒç Nappe, was thrust from the southern area, but its roots were probably consumed entirely, so its paleogeographic position is not exactly known. Choƒç Nappe is considered as rootless nappe. After the end of main Eo-Alpine orogenic movement, the area of Western Carpathians was still not so mountainous. In the Paleogene subsidence along the normal faults caused formation of grabens - intra-mountain Inner Carpathian Paleogene Basin and horsts present day mountain ranges. In the Neogene, further orogene movement in the external part of Carpathian arc caused formation of back-arc Pannonian Basin. Northern branches of Pannonian Basin were penetrating the Tatra-Fatra Area and formed inter-mountain basins. Simultaneously with the immersion of the horsts, ongoing and intense erosion is denuding the mountains and supplies the basin with clastic sediments. Among all of the rocks, the most erosion resistant were the crystalline schists and granites of the Tatric. Similar fold and thrust model of origin is known from the other areas of alpine system. In the English terminology, similar model is called Fault-block mountain, it is typical in the area of Basin and Range.

It has been elaborated upon by Thai academics and agencies, promoted by the Government of Thailand, and applied by over 23,000 villages in Thailand that have SEP-based projects in operation. History Soon after ascending to the throne in 1946, King Bhumibol toured the country and became aware of the hardships facing Thai farmers. At that time, the per capita GDP was about US$200. He took a keen interest in rural development, and instituted a number of royal projects to help the lot of the rural impoverished. The sufficiency economy philosophy was elaborated upon in the king's speeches to students at Kasetsart University in 1974 and Khon Kaen University. To the latter he said, \\"Development of the country must proceed in stages. First of all, there must be a foundation with the majority of the people having enough to live on by using methods and equipment which are economical but technically correct as well. When such a secure foundation is adequately ready and operational, then it can be gradually expanded and developed to raise prosperity and the economic standard to a higher level by stages.\\" Sufficiency economy came to prominence during the 1997 economic crisis when the king told a nationwide television audience, \\"Recently, so many projects have been implemented, so many factories have been built, that it was thought Thailand would become a little tiger, and then a big tiger. People were crazy about becoming a tiger...Being a tiger is not important. The important thing for us is to have a sufficient economy. A sufficient economy means to have enough to support ourselves...\\" The sufficiency economy Three interrelated components and two underlying conditions are central to SEP's application. The three components are reasonableness (or wisdom), moderation, and prudence. Two essential underlying conditions are knowledge and morality. In contrast to the concept that the primary duty of a company is to maximize profits for the benefit of shareholders, SEP emphasizes maximizing the interests of all stakeholders and having a greater focus on long-term profitability as opposed to short-term success. The Chaipattana Foundation says sufficiency economy is \\"...a method of development based on moderation, prudence, and social immunity, one that uses knowledge and virtue as guidelines in living.\\" A chapter entitled \\"Buddhist Economics\\" in E.F. Schumacher's book, Small Is Beautiful provides much of the intellectual underpinning of King Bhumibol's sufficiency economy theories. The king was moved to translate it‚Äîit is not clear if he translated only the chapter or the book in its entirety‚Äîinto the Thai language. An official biography of King Bhumibol says he \\"used part of the material in the book...for a Thai discourse on Buddhist Economics.\\" National Identity Office, Secretariat of the Prime Minister, Thailand. King Bhumibol: Strength of the Land. vol.2, 2000 p 64. Schumacher was a Christian whose thinking was influenced by what he observed in Burma and India. Sufficiency economy is not a theory about how the economy of a country works, but rather a guide for making decisions that will produce outcomes that are beneficial to development. According to Thailand's National Economic and Social Development Board: The Oxford Business Group's 2016 report on Thailand says \\"the sufficiency economy concept puts sustainability at its very core\\" and \\"is now seen as an important contributor to the UN's international development goals...advancing a different approach from short-term shareholder value-centred ideas of economic development.\\" Self-sufficiency economics promotes the idea of limited production in order to protect the environment and conserve scarce resources. Production should be aimed at individual consumption. Production in excess of consumption may be sold. The philosophy holds that the rich can consume as many resources as they like so long as their consumption does not incur debt, and that the poor should consume resources without borrowing.  Translating philosophy into action  The Thai governmental organisation most responsible for implementing the sufficiency economy is the National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB). The NESDB's primary tool for mobilising action is the publication of the National Economic and Development Plan. The latest (twelfth) version of this plan covers the years 2017-2021. After the 2006 coup d'√©tat, the military junta claimed that the policies of deposed Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra were inconsistent with the king's philosophy.\\"Rebranding Thaksinomics\\", The Economist, 11 Jan 2007 The preamble of the junta's new constitution stated that promotion of self-sufficiency was one of the fundamental roles of the state. The junta-appointed Prime Minister, Surayud Chulanont, pledged to allocate 10 billion baht (US$300 million) for projects to promote well-being in line with King Bhumibol's sufficiency economy principle. He made the pledge while participating in King Bhumibol's 80th birthday celebrations.\\"PM earmarks B10bn for well-being\\", Bangkok Post, 10 Mar 2007 Pit thong lang phra Pit thong lang phra (; ; ) is a Thai idiom meaning \\"to eschew praise for one's good deeds\\". It is the name of a royal initiative to foster rural development using the philosophy of the sufficiency economy. Founded in 2008, the project is in its second phase, from 2016 to 2020. It was first deployed for five years in Nan, Udon Thani, Phetchaburi, Uthai Thani, and Kalasin Provinces. It enabled farmers in 2,017 families to earn 285 million baht in income. The second phase of the project will aim at assisting farmers in Khon Kaen's Ubolratana District and 21 villages in Yala, Pattani, and Narathiwat Provinces. It will be funded with 1.5 billion baht from the Office of the Prime Minister, focusing the efforts of four state agencies.  Critiques  According to an opinion expressed in a leaked unclassified, yet sensitive, message from the US Embassy in Bangkok to the US State Department, the tenets of sufficiency economy are described as \\"vague and malleable\\", and its popularity is due to a \\"...public reluctance to criticize anything associated with the revered King.\\" And‚Äîas one economist put it‚Äî\\"Who can oppose a model that promotes 'reasonableness', 'good behavior', and 'protection from shocks\\" Many economists were, for the most part, left confused by the meaning of sufficiency economy. After a meeting with Thai Ministry of Finance officials where the need for more sufficiency was lauded, Standard & Poor's director of sovereign ratings admitted that, \\"No one knows what [sufficiency economy] really means.\\" The Asia Times noted that \\"There is a concurrent risk that the royal philosophy will be twisted by less scrupulous government officials as an opportunity to abuse their authority for rent-seeking and extortion, particularly among foreign-invested concerns\\". NGO activists who embraced the king's sufficiency economy theory to oppose the construction of large-scale dams were rebuffed by Bhumibol, a long-time advocate of dam construction, who claimed that the deforestation caused by dams was a necessary evil to provide consistent energy and water sources for farmers. There have been efforts by the military government to incorporate the king's sufficiency economy in national economic policy. Thai critics are generally careful to direct their criticisms towards the military rather than the king, out of fear of prosecution for l√®se majest√©. Consequently, criticisms are most often targeted at ineffective application rather than disagreement in principle. Nonetheless, common points of disagreement include: #The philosophy is not consistent with the realities of Thailand's economic development. #Nobody understands what \\"sufficiency economy\\" really means and there are several vague interpretations. Professor Kevin Hewison, Director of the Carolina Asia Center at the University of North Carolina, is critical of sufficiency economy. He has written that, \\"Sufficiency Economy is essentially about keeping the poor in their place. The people and organisations that promote SE are a wonderfully contradictory lot. The king, promoting moderation, sits at the head of a family and institutional wealth that is huge, based on land ownership and large capitalist corporations. The Crown Property Bureau's known institutional wealth is estimated more than US$40 billion.... Prime Minister Surayud spends considerable time talking up SE and his government has made huge budget allocations to SE activities. Meanwhile, Surayud has declared collections of luxury cars and watches and expensive homes, despite having been on a relatively low military salary his entire career. The contradictions are massive. For the wealthy, SE means that they can enjoy their wealth so long as they do so within their means. For the poor, the advice is to make do. In class terms, SE becomes an ideology to justify inequalities.

It is the only one of Sayers's twelve major crime novels not to feature Lord Peter Wimsey, her most famous detective character. Plot This is an epistolary novel, told primarily in the form of letters between some of the characters, using the multiple narrative technique associated with Modernist novelists of the period. This collection of documents--hence the novel's title--is explained as a dossier of evidence collected by the victim's son as part of his campaign to obtain justice for his father. Novelist John Munting shares with former public school contemporary and talented painter Harwood Lathom, a rented top floor flat in respectably suburban Bayswater (London). The landlord and downstairs neighbour, Harrison, is a staid, middle- aged widower who has remarried. His new wife Margaret is younger, attractive, passionate and self-absorbed. Lathom and Mrs Harrison begin an affair, the husband suspecting nothing, and Lathom paints a remarkable portrait of her. Creeping downstairs to meet his mistress one night, Lathom encounters the Harrisons' neurotic live-in spinster companion, Agatha Milsom, who mistakes him for Munting in the dark and makes accusations of assault. Faced with Harrison's furious reaction and glad of an excuse to leave a distasteful situation, Munting moves out and marries his fianc√©e. Lathom departs for Paris and his portrait of Mrs Harrison, exhibited at the Royal Academy, makes his reputation on the London art scene. Meeting Lathom by chance sometime later, Munting is persuaded to accompany Lathom to a remote Devonshire cottage where he is holidaying with Harrison, who is pursuing his hobby of cooking with ingredients available in the wild, and is an expert on edible mushrooms. On arrival they find Harrison hideously dead, apparently having cooked and eaten poisonous fungi by mistake. Returning from Africa, Harrison's engineer son Paul suspects that Lathom and his stepmother have conspired to murder Harrison, and Munting is drawn unwillingly into the investigation. He learns that muscarine - the poison that killed Harrison - in its natural state, differs from synthetic muscarine, in that the natural molecule, found in mushrooms, is asymmetrical, consisting of only one molecular form, but synthetic muscarine is racemic, which means that it consists of a mixture of equal quantities of the molecule as found in nature and its unnatural \\"mirror- image\\" form. The two types of muscarine can be distinguished by using polarized light: when polarized light is shined through a solution of the racemic mixture, the direction of polarization does not change, but when polarized light passes through a solution consisting of only one form of muscarine (or of any asymmetrical molecule), the direction of polarization rotates as the light passes through the solution. The muscarine consumed by Harrison proves to be synthetic, indicating that the mushrooms he ate were poisoned deliberately by addition of synthetic muscarine stolen from a lab. Letters between Mrs Harrison and Lathom indicate that she manipulated him into the killing by claiming that she was expecting his child. Lathom is hanged for murder.

Themes & sources Dorothy Sayers' co-author, under the pseudonym of Robert Eustace, was Dr Eustace Barton, a physician who also wrote medico- legal thrillers. Barton suggested to Sayers the scientific theme crucial to the novel's d√©nouement, which concerns the difference between a naturally produced organic compound and the corresponding synthetic material, and the use of the polariscope to distinguish between them. He travelled to University College Hospital in August 1928 to consult colleagues and see a practical demonstration of the effect.Reynolds, Barbara. Dorothy L Sayers: Her Life and Soul. London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1993. As a practising Christian, Sayers was pleased with the religious-scientific theme offered to her by Eustace, which was based on the idea that the asymmetry of living molecules was an indication of the hand of God in creation. This point is made very clear in the lengthy exposition at the local vicar's dinner party, where Munting follows a wide- ranging debate about religion, science and the origin of life. A keen choral singer in her Oxford University years, Sayers introduces at this point the key theme of Haydn's oratorio The Creation. Having established herself as a successful writer, Sayers intended this book as a departure or experiment, away from the conventional detective story towards the crime novel. In her previous novel Strong Poison she had introduced the character of the crime novelist Harriet Vane as the love interest of her popular amateur sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey, and now she omitted Wimsey altogether in a very differently structured and conceived crime novel. The novel clearly draws upon the notable 1922 Thompson/Bywaters case, which led to the miscarriage of justice whereby Edith Thompson was hanged, along with her lover Frederick Bywaters, for his murder of her husband, supposedly at her instigation, thanks to her fancifully passionate letters offered in evidence at their joint trial. Sayers' presentation of Margaret Harrison (and her letters) in the novel makes an interesting contrast with F Tennyson Jesse's 1934 novel A Pin To See The Peepshow, similarly based on the Thompson/Bywaters case. Tennyson Jesse's Julia Almond is presented very differently from Sayers' Margaret Harrison. However, she was ultimately disappointed with the way the book turned out. \\"In my heart,\\" she wrote, \\"I know I have made a failure of it... I wish I could have done better with the brilliant plot.\\".Reynolds, Barbara. Dorothy L Sayers: Her Life and Soul p 221. London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1993.

Located in the Greenbush section of Scituate, it is the terminus of the Greenbush Line. Like the other stations on the line, Greenbush has a single high full- length side platform serving a single passenger track. The other four tracks at the station area are used as the layover facility for the line. There are two large parking lots cut into two by Old Driftway. The parking lots total 1000 spaces - twice the capacity of the other stations on the line - to accommodate commuters driving in from Hanover, Norwell, Marshfield, and Duxbury.  History  The modern Greenbush Line was originally built as the South Shore Railroad, which opened to Cohasset in 1849. The Old Colony-backed Duxbury and Cohasset Railroad, chartered in 1867, which opened from Cohasset to Duxbury in 1871, including a stop at South Scituate. The station was renamed Greenbush on October 1, 1877.} After financial troubles in the 1870s, the Duxbury and Cohasset was joined with the South Shore under the fold of the Old Colony Railroad in 1877. The Old Colony was leased to the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad in 1893. An inbound train leaving Greenbush station in 2012, five years after the restoration of service Greenbush became an important short-turn terminal on the South Shore Line, particularly as ridership began to wane. Service south of Greenbush, limited to a single South Duxbury round trip since 1932, was discontinued in 1939 after the 1938 New England hurricane damaged the causeway over the North River to Marshfield. The line enjoyed a brief uptick in traffic in World War II with the construction of the Hingham Naval Ammunition Depot and the Hingham Naval Ammunition Depot Annex. The number of daily trips was increased from 4 to 8 after World War II under Frederick C. Dumaine, Jr., and modern diesel trains including Budd RDCs were introduced in the 1950s. However, the New Haven Railroad continued to lose money on the service, and after Dumaine was ousted the railroad announced all trains would cease running in 1958. Only an emergency subsidy by the state kept trains running until June 30, 1959 when the Southeast Expressway opened and all passenger train service ended. Calls for the former Old Colony lines to be reactivated began in the 1980s; the Plymouth/Kingston Line and Middleborough/Lakeville Line were reopened in 1997. After much controversy surrounding the $534 million project, construction was completed in 2007. The Greenbush line and Greenbush Station were opened for full service on October 31, 2007 after a ceremonial train the previous day. Station layout The station consists of a single side platform serving the easternmost track. Adjacent to the platform, the Greenbush layover consists of four tracks, which are used to store trains overnight. Also adjacent to the platform, a massive parking lot accommodates commuters from nearby towns, such as Norwell and Hanover.

Johnson accompanied Joseph and Hyrum Smith on their way to Carthage Jail the day before the Smiths were murdered. Johnson was taken prisoner when the mob entered Nauvoo. Iowa After the majority of Latter Day Saints abandoned Nauvoo, Johnson went to Kanesville, Iowa, in 1848, where he built the first house in Pottawattamie County, Iowa. Johnson was postmaster at Council Bluffs for five years. In this position, Johnson obtained the change of the settlement's name from Kanesville to Council Bluffs. He was a member of the first city council for several years. He established the Council Bluffs Bugle in 1852; the Bugle was vocal in supporting the establishment of Omaha as the capital of Nebraska Territory. Johnson opened the first store Omaha and sent the first train of goods to the Cherry Creek mines in Denver, Colorado. In 1854, he published the Omaha Arrow, the first newspaper published in Nebraska, and the same year accompanied the first party of explorers for a railroad crossing on the Missouri River and Loupe Fork of the Platte River. Johnson wrote the first article published favoring the North Platte route for the Pacific Railroad. Johnson crossed the plains to Utah Territory and back in 1850. In 1857, he started the Crescent City Oracle and laid out Crescent, Iowa. In 1858. he published the Council Bluffs Press. In 1858 to 1861 he published The Huntsman's Echo at Wood River, Nebraska. Utah In 1861, Johnson moved to Utah Territory. He traveled in the pioneer company of Sixtus E. Johnson, which had about 200 people.Pioneer Company Search Results Pioneer Company Search Results In 1863, he established the Farmer's Oracle at Spring Lake Villa, Utah County. In 1864‚Äì65, he removed to St. George and began a supply garden and nursery. In 1868‚Äì69 he published Our Dixie Times, afterward the Rio Virgen Times [sic]. In 1870, Johnson began publishing the Utah Pomologist and Gardener as a monthly. In 1876, he went to Silver Reef and built a store and printing office, but sold part of office before the newspaper was fairly started. In 1879 it was burned out, with others. He restored the store immediately, but on a larger scale. In 1882, Johnson moved at his church's call, this time to settle what would become Tempe, Arizona. He died in Tempe and was buried at the City of Mesa Cemetery. Notes External links Biography on Nebraska State Historical Marker, at ancestry.com (text) (photo) *Bassett, Samuel Clay.

Sites may include social networking media including feature such as user-based categorizing, webcam hosting, blogs and comments. This is in contrast to the static content offered by \\"Web 1.0\\" porn sites. Porn 2.0 sites may offer features similar to mainstream Web 2.0 services such as video communities (Metacafe, Vimeo, YouTube) and social sites (Tumblr, Twitter), general blogging, (Blogger, DailyBooth, Lookbook.nu) and photo hosting (Flickr, Photobucket, Picasa). Since their inception, Porn 2.0 Web sites have garnered great popularity, but have meanwhile encountered various legal and other difficulties. Among these difficulties are concern about the digital content copyright, trade media and affiliating partnership advertising. Other concerns include the idea of sharing vs. privacy and the legal ramifications of large quantities of free, user-generated pornographic content on the Internet. For Porn 3.0, news media often suggest the usage of 3D stereoscopy, multi-angle DVDPorn 3.0: the next gen of sex biz tech, p2, TechRadar neural impulse actuators, and peripheral controller and devicesPorn 3.0: the next gen of sex biz tech, p3, TechRadar similar to game controller vibration, eliminating less probable technologies such as holograms. Challenges While some argue that pornographic sites are a natural development for an industry that has always been at the forefront of technological advancements, Porn 2.0 has presented several difficulties and challenges. =Copyright issues= Copyright infringement is chief among the challenges that have confronted Porn 2.0. Porn 2.0 websites have come under attack as being potentially harmful to the economics of more traditional pornography outlets such as DVD sales and monthly paid subscription adult sites. As with YouTube, any site that allows users to upload content runs the risk of infringing on the copyrights of the original producers. While this was a grey issue at the inception of the Web 2.0 movement, a billion dollar lawsuit filed by Viacom in 2007 against YouTube (see \\"Copyright Infringement\\") will bring this issue before the courts and will have a massive potential effect on the viability of Porn 2.0 as a business strategy. YouTube has since won the suit. A 2007 decision by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals found that the 2257 legislation (Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act) was unconstitutional and violated first amendment rights.United States Court of Appeals - Sixth Circuit The decision was overturned in a 2009 en banc rehearing. The United States Supreme Court declined to hear the matter. =Privacy= It is possible that users upload material without the models' consent. This is usually prohibited by the sites' Terms of Use, although some sites such as Voyeurweb allow non-consensual photos and move offices frequently to avoid the legal issues this might otherwise entail., Wired.com, October 2002 =Monetization= Unlike Web 2.0 ventures such as Facebook, Myspace or YouTube, Porn 2.0 has yet to find a strategy that proves to be commercially profitable. High server costs from hosting the large amount of user-generated content paired with little to no user-generated income puts Porn 2.0 websites in a challenging financial position. Because Porn 2.0 services have, so far, been free of charge to users, the only source of revenue for these sites is from advertising placement.

His works dealt principally with plants from the Arctic and from the Rocky Mountains, mainly taxonomy and morphology. He published over 150 papers reflecting his research which included his series Studies on the Cyperaceae and Medicinal Plants of North America. Biography Herman Theodor Holm was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. He studied botany at the University of Copenhagen under professor Eugenius Warming and graduated 1880. In 1882-1883, he participated in the expedition on board the Danish vessel Dijmphna (Dijmphna- expeditionen 1882-83) to the territory between Russia and the North Pole during the First International Polar Year. The ship was icebound for a period in the Kara Sea. He also explored the flora of West Greenland as assistant to Eugenius Warming on the Fylla expedition in 1884. He emigrated to the U.S., landing in New York City on April 12, 1888. He soon was employed as assistant botanist by the U.S. National Museum. In 1893 when he received American citizenship. From 1893-1897, he was assistant pathologist with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). He obtained his Ph.D. in botany from the Catholic University of America in Washington D.C. in 1902. He then moved to the countryside of Brookland, DC and later in Clinton, Maryland and did assistant work as a botanist for the Smithsonian Institution and the USDA. Although a Lutheran, in 1932 he joined the faculty of the Catholic University of America, but died soon after. Honors The small-reed species Calamagrostis holmii Lange is named for him.

A related pseudogene has been identified on chromosome 1. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. This gene is a member of the iron/manganese superoxide dismutase family. It encodes a mitochondrial protein that forms a homotetramer and binds one manganese ion per subunit. This protein binds to the superoxide byproducts of oxidative phosphorylation and converts them to hydrogen peroxide and diatomic oxygen. Mutations in this gene have been associated with idiopathic cardiomyopathy (IDC), premature aging, sporadic motor neuron disease, and cancer.  Structure  The SOD2 gene contains five exons interrupted by four introns, an uncharacteristic 5‚Ä≤-proximal promoter that possesses a GC-rich region in place of the TATA or CAAT, and an enhancer in the second intron. The proximal promoter region contains multiple binding sites for transcription factors, including specific-1 (Sp1), activator protein 2 (AP-2), and early growth response 1 (Egr-1). This gene is a mitochondrial member of the iron/manganese superoxide dismutase family. It encodes a mitochondrial matrix protein that forms a homotetramer and binds one manganese ion per subunit. The manganese site forms a trigonal bipyramidal geometry with four ligands from the protein and a fifth solvent ligand. This solvent ligand is a hydroxide believed to serve as the electron acceptor of the enzyme. The active site cavity consists of a network of side chains of several residues associated by hydrogen bonding, extending from the aqueous ligand of the metal. Of note, the highly conserved residue Tyr34 plays a key role in the hydrogen-bonding network, as nitration of this residue inhibits the protein's catalytic ability. This protein also possesses an N-terminal mitochondrial leader sequence which targets it to the mitochondrial matrix, where it converts mitochondrial-generated reactive oxygen species from the respiratory chain to H2. Alternate transcriptional splice variants, encoding different isoforms, have been characterized.  Function  As a member of the iron/manganese superoxide dismutase family, this protein transforms toxic superoxide, a byproduct of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, into hydrogen peroxide and diatomic oxygen. This function allows SOD2 to clear mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and, as a result, confer protection against cell death. As a result, this protein plays an antiapoptotic role against oxidative stress, ionizing radiation, and inflammatory cytokines.  Clinical significance  The SOD2 enzyme is an important constituent in apoptotic signaling and oxidative stress, most notably as part of the mitochondrial death pathway and cardiac myocyte apoptosis signaling. Programmed cell death is a distinct genetic and biochemical pathway essential to metazoans. An intact death pathway is required for successful embryonic development and the maintenance of normal tissue homeostasis. Apoptosis has proven to be tightly interwoven with other essential cell pathways. The identification of critical control points in the cell death pathway has yielded fundamental insights for basic biology, as well as provided rational targets for new therapeutics a normal embryologic processes, or during cell injury (such as ischemia-reperfusion injury during heart attacks and strokes) or during developments and processes in cancer, an apoptotic cell undergoes structural changes including cell shrinkage, plasma membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and fragmentation of the DNA and nucleus. This is followed by fragmentation into apoptotic bodies that are quickly removed by phagocytes, thereby preventing an inflammatory response. It is a mode of cell death defined by characteristic morphological, biochemical and molecular changes. It was first described as a \\"shrinkage necrosis\\", and then this term was replaced by apoptosis to emphasize its role opposite mitosis in tissue kinetics. In later stages of apoptosis the entire cell becomes fragmented, forming a number of plasma membrane-bounded apoptotic bodies which contain nuclear and or cytoplasmic elements. The ultrastructural appearance of necrosis is quite different, the main features being mitochondrial swelling, plasma membrane breakdown and cellular disintegration. Apoptosis occurs in many physiological and pathological processes. It plays an important role during embryonal development as programmed cell death and accompanies a variety of normal involutional processes in which it serves as a mechanism to remove \\"unwanted\\" cells. =Cancer risk= Numerous studies have reported associations between SOD2 polymorphisms and cancer risk, but results have been inconsistent. An updated meta-analysis of such studies revealed that SOD2 polymorphisms are related to the development of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. = Role in oxidative stress = Most notably, SOD2 is pivotal in reactive oxygen species (ROS) release during oxidative stress by ischemia-reperfusion injury, specifically in the myocardium as part of a heart attack (also known as ischemic heart disease). Ischemic heart disease, which results from an occlusion of one of the major coronary arteries, is currently still the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in western society. During ischemia reperfusion, ROS release substantially contribute to the cell damage and death via a direct effect on the cell as well as via apoptotic signals. SOD2 is known to have a capacity to limit the detrimental effects of ROS. As such, SOD2 is important for its cardioprotective effects. In addition, SOD2 has been implicated in cardioprotection against ischemia-reperfusion injury, such as during ischemic preconditioning of the heart. Although a large burst of ROS is known to lead to cell damage, a moderate release of ROS from the mitochondria, which occurs during nonlethal short episodes of ischemia, can play a significant triggering role in the signal transduction pathways of ischemic preconditioning leading to reduction of cell damage. It has even observed that during this release of ROS, SOD2 plays an important role hereby regulating apoptotic signaling and cell death. Due to its cytoprotective effects, overexpression of SOD2 has been linked to increased invasiveness of tumor metastasis. Its role in controlling ROS levels also involves it in ageing, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease. Mutations in this gene have been associated with idiopathic cardiomyopathy (IDC), sporadic motor neuron disease, and cancer. A common polymorphism associated with greater susceptibility to various pathologies is found in the mitochondrial leader targeting sequence (Val9Ala). Mice lacking Sod2 die shortly after birth, indicating that unchecked levels of superoxide are incompatible with mammalian life. However, mice 50% deficient in Sod2 have a normal lifespan and minimal phenotypic defects but do suffer increased DNA damage and increased incidence of cancer. In Drosophila melanogaster, over- expression of Sod2 has been shown to increase maximum lifespan by 20% in one study, and by as much as 37% in another study. Yeast studies In wild-type budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear DNA fragmentation increased 3-fold during cellular aging, whereas in the absence of SOD2 nuclear DNA fragmentation increased by 5-fold during aging. Production of reactive oxygen species also increased with cellular age, but by a greater amount in SOD2 mutant cells than in wild-type cells. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, SOD2 deficiency, drastically increased cellular aging and decreased cell viability in the stationary phase of the growth cycle. Role in invertebrates SOD2's significant role in oxidative stress management makes it an essential component of the mitochondria. As a result, SOD2 similarly to SOD1 and SOD3 is highly conserved in vertebrates as well as in invertebrates. In the study Multiple measures of functionality exhibit progressive decline in a parallel, stochastic fashion in Drosophilla Sod2 mutants. In SOD2 mutants there was a cascade of deterioration within the organ systems. These deterioration were not linear in that one organ's system would fail then the other, rather on the contrary the deterioration were parallel, meaning that various systems would be affected at any given time. The build up of ROS's in the flies did play a substantial role in affecting the organ system s of the flies in such a way, that though not all observed flies suffered permanent damage, the damages that were observed were like those associated with old age in mature fruit flies. The tissues that are affected in light of defective SOD2 in invertebrates are the muscles, heart, and brain. ROS's effect on these tissue results in not only loss of cellular function in most cases, but a substantial loss in longevity. Though SOD2's role in oxidative stress management is one that has been accepted for both vertebrates and invertebrates, its necessity has been questioned by a study that was conducted on Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). The correlation between the lack of defective SOD2 and loss of longevity and function is generally understood, however it was discovered that the removal of some of the five members of the SOD family including SOD2 resulted in the increase in longevity in mutant C. elegans compared to the wild type.  Animal studies  When animals are exercised at a relatively high work rate, exercise training promotes an increase in myocardial MnSOD activity. Increased MnSOD activity is required to achieve optimal training-induced protection against both ischemia/reperfusion(IR)-induced cardiac arrhythmias and infarction Using an antisense oligonucleotide against MnSOD to prevent ExTr-induced increases in myocardial MnSOD activity, it was demonstrated that an increase in myocardial MnSOD activity is required to provide training-induced protection against IR- induced myocardial infarction. Using a MnSOD gene silencing approach, reported that prevention of the ExTr-induced increase in myocardial MnSOD resulted in a loss of training-induced protection against IR-mediated arrhythmias. In a mouse model, mitochondrial oxidative stress caused by SOD2 deficiency promoted cellular senescence and aging phenotypes in the skin including an increase in DNA double-strand breaks (see DNA damage theory of aging). Loss of epidermal SOD2 in mice induced cellular senescence, which irreversibly arrested proliferation of a fraction of keratinocytes. In older mice SOD2 deficiency delayed wound closure and reduced epidermal thickness. Mutant mice with a connective tissue specific lack of SOD2 had a reduced lifespan and a premature onset of aging-related phenotypes such as weight loss, skin atrophy, kyphosis (curvature of the spine), osteoporosis, and muscle degeneration. SOD2 over- expression was found to extend lifespan in mice.  Interactions  The SOD2 gene has been shown to bind: *Sp1, *NF-Œ∫B, *AP-1, *AP-2, *Egr-1, *CREB, *p53, and *NFE2L2. The SOD2 protein has been shown to interact with HIV-1 Tat and HIV-1 Vif.

The organization also changed the festival's parade route. Instead of traveling south from Meridian Hill Park and then westward on P Street N.W. to finish at Francis Junior High School, the parade now began at the school, moved east along P Street N.W. to 14th Street N.W., and then south on 14th Street to Freedom Plaza.Chibbaro, \\"Politics Take Backseat at Pride,\\" Washington Blade, June 10, 2005.\\"Capital Pride Takes to the Streets,\\" Washington Post, June 9, 2007.

She was used by the Union Navy primarily as a mortar gunboat, but also as a gunboat stationed off Confederate ports to prevent their trading with foreign countries. Matthew Vassar, a wooden, centerboard schooner was purchased by the Navy at New York City 9 September 1861; fitted out as a mortar schooner at New York Navy Yard; and commissioned 25 January 1862, Acting Master Hugh H. Savage in command.  Assigned as a mortar ship for duty in the Mississippi River  Assigned to the Mortar Flotilla, organized to neutralize Confederate forts guarding the sea approaches to New Orleans, Louisiana, the schooner got underway in mid February and sailed via Key West, Florida, and Ship Island, Mississippi, for the Mississippi River. She crossed the bar at Pass a l'Outre 18 March and anchored in the muddy waters of the Mississippi Delta.  Assaulting Forts St. Philip and Jackson on the Mississippi  After a month of preparing for the assault, the schooners moved upstream to carefully selected positions and opened fire on Fort St. Philip and Fort Jackson, New Orleans' main protection from attack from the sea. Matthew Vassar operated in the 2d Division of Commander David Porter's Mortar Flotilla during the 6 day cannonade. On the night of 24 April the bombardment rose to a mighty crescendo as Flag Officer David Farragut fought his strong fleet past the forts to capture the South's largest and wealthiest city. This bold stroke deprived the Confederacy of her most productive industrial center, tightened the Union blockade, and raised hope of restoring the entire Mississippi Valley to the Federal Government. When he was barely behind the forts, Farragut dashed off a word of thanks to Porter: > You supported us most nobly.  Assaulting Mobile, Alabama  While Farragut led his steamers on a reconnaissance expedition up the Mississippi River, Porter took his schooners to Ship Island to prepare for an attack on Mobile, Alabama. There, Matthew Vassar and , 15 May, captured Confederate blockade running sloops Sarah and New Eagle trying to slip to sea, laden with cotton. After learning that Confederate batteries had been sited high on the hillside safe from his low projectory guns, Farragut ordered up the mortar boats to attack the river stronghold. Porter took his schooners to a point just below Vicksburg, Mississippi, where they shelled the Confederate batteries while Farragut's fleet steamed upstream past Vicksburg, 28 June, and joined Flag Officer Davis's flotilla. However, sufficient troops were not available to reduce the Confederate fortress; so Farragut, again supported by covering fire from the mortars, dashed downstream by Vicksburg and retired to New Orleans.  Assigned blockade duty on the U.S. East Coast  Ordered back to the U.S. East Coast, Matthew Vassar spent the rest of the war on blockade duty. She captured schooner Florida off Little River Inlet, North Carolina, as the blockade runner tried to slip in with a cargo of salt for the Confederacy 11 January 1863. On 3 March Acting Master's Mate George Drain led a boat crew from Matthew Vassar which destroyed a large boat at Little River Inlet. Proceeding up the western branch of the river to destroy salt works, the boat grounded and the crew was captured by Confederate troops. On 27 April, boat crews from Matthew Vassar and boarded and destroyed British blockade runner Golden Liner in Murrell's Inlet, South Carolina, with a cargo of flour, brandy, sugar, and coffee for the straitened South.  Reassigned to the East Gulf Blockade  Assigned to the East Gulf Blockading Squadron, 29 November 1864, Matthew Vassar took her last prize of the war, schooner John Hate, off St. Marks, Florida, 3 February 1865, as the blockade runner attempted to bring lead, blankets, and rope to the depleted South.  Post-war decommissioning and sale  After the war ended Matthew Vassar decommissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 10 July 1865, and was sold at auction there 10 August.

Although Saltponders are Fantis, who are a part of the bigger Akan tribe, the name ABRUQUAH is purported to have its origins from the Akyems who are thought to have migrated from the Eastern \\"Akyem\\" Region of Ghana to their present location at the coast, where they integrated well into the Fantis; hence, the other name of Saltpond, Akyemfo, meaning \\"peapole from Akyem\\". The name can therefore be found in the Eastern Region of Ghana but spelt differently as ABROKWAH, although these two may share the same ancestry. Joseph Wilfred Abruquah One of the renowned sons of the ABRUQUAH genealogy was Joseph Wilfred Abruquah. JW Abruquah is probably the most well-known headmaster of Mfantsipim School, the first second cycle institution in Ghana. He was the headmaster from 1963 to 1970, when The School, as he often referred to Mfantsipim School, rediscovered its pride as the first and best secondary school in Ghana. As an old student of Mfantsipim, he authored \\"The Catechist\\" in 1965 and \\"The Torrent\\" in 1968 , and was well known for always correcting his peers that the name is \\"Mfantsipim School\\" and not \\"Mfantsipim Secondary School\\".

Gongylonema pulchrum infections are due to humans acting as accidental hosts for the parasite. There are seven genera of spirudia nematodes that infect human hosts accidentally: Gnathostoma, Thelazia, Gongylonema, Physaloptera, Spirocerca, Rictularia. The G. pulchrum parasite is a nematode worm of the order Spirurida. It is a relatively thin nematode, and like other worms within its class, it has no circulatory or respiratory system. Most other Gongylonema species infect birds and mammals: there are 25 species found in mammals and 10 species found in birds. This parasite is multi-cellular, and capable of movement. They have numerous rear mucosal projections, which assumedly assist propulsion through the thin layer of skin on the inside of the human host's mouth. They also have an excretory system possessing lateral canals. This parasite eats epithelial cells. Also, very often the canals are a place of inflammation, with accumulation of exudates in them. Gongylonema also swallows these exudates. History of discovery Gongylonema pulchrum was first named and presented with its own species by Molin in 1857. The first reported case was in 1850 by Dr. Joseph Leidy, when he identified a worm \\"obtained from the mouth of a child\\" from the Philadelphia Academy. He originally described it as Filariae hominis oris, and initially considered the worm was a guinea worm (Dracunculus medinensis), but because of the unique location of the worm (buccal cavity), and the relatively short size compared to the guinea worm, the hypothesis was disregarded. There have only been around 50 reported human cases of G. pulchrum worldwide since 1864, and these infections have been widespread and globally ubiquitous. G. pulchrum infections have been notoriously and historically hard to diagnose due to symptom complaints by patients (see \\"Symptoms\\" and \\"Diagnosis\\" below). Also, morphological diagnosis of the parasite is also somewhat complicated because of the variable size of adult worms, and the tendency of the worm to be different lengths depending on what host the worm is recovered from (see \\"Morphology\\" below). Transmission Transmission to humans is due mostly to unsanitary conditions and the ingestion of infected coprophagous insects, mostly dung beetles and cockroaches. Beyond direct ingestion of infected intermediate hosts (insects), foods can become contaminated if unsanitary conditions pervade in the production of the food- coprophagous insects are found in the food, or in the production chain. Also, contaminated water sources, again with the intermediate hosts or the infective third stage larva, can lead to transmission to humans. The infection usually occurs when someone drinks contaminated water, or consumes an infected beetle. The buccal mucosa, which is the ideal environment for the parasite, is the mucous membrane of the inside of the cheek. It is non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium, and is continuous with the mucosae of the soft palate, the undersurface of the tongue and the floor of the mouth. Reservoir and vectors Gongylonema pulchrum, along with most other Gongylonema nematodes, has a broad natural host range. This includes hedgehogs, cattle, dogs, cats, ruminants, rabbits, and skunks. The vector and intermediate host for Gongylonema pulchrum infections are coprophagous insects (dung beetles and cockroaches). Incubation In humans, there can be an up to six week incubation period for worm development and symptoms may not appear until the second molting of the worm, in which the young adult worms begin migration from the esophagus to the buccal and oral palate tissue. It is this movement through the mucosa of the mouth and lips that causes patients to complain of symptoms. Gongylonema pulchrum burrows in the mucosal lining of the esophagus and other parts of the buccal cavity. There the females lay their thick shelled eggs containing first stage larvae. The larvae all possess a cephalic hook and rows of tiny spines around a blunt anterior end, so when they hatch they may further infest their hosts. Morphology The morphology of the worm is as follows, from a 2000 Veterinary Medicine study: \\"The anterior end in both sexes was covered by numerous cuticular platelets. There was a pair of lateral cervical papillae. The buccal opening was small and extended in the dorsoventral direction. Around the mouth a cuticular elevation enclosed the labia, and eight papillae were located laterodorsally and lateroventrally. Two large lateral amphids were seen. On the lateral sides of the female's tail, phasmidal apertures were observed. The caudal end of the male was asymmetrically alate and bore 10 pairs of papillae and two phasmidal apertures.\\" The average length for male worms is , while the average length for adult females is . The worm is highly mobile, as observed in patients‚Äô mouths and as evidenced by the morphological design of the worm. Life cycle Life cycle In humans, the hypothesized life cycle is as follows: Ingestion of contaminated food, water, or infected dung beetle. Infects upper esophagus, moves around and lays eggs in buccal cavity of human host, ingested eggs locate near esophagus, develop and mature into adult worms after two subsequent molting stages, migrate into buccal cavity, no eggs are ever found in human feces, which strengthens the assumption that humans are solely incidental, accidental, and dead end hosts for the Gongylonema pulchrum parasite life cycle. The G. pulchrum parasite has also been studied in vivo in rabbits. The life cycle is as follows: Infective third stage larva from naturally infected dung beetles (intermediate hosts and vectors), were orally given to rabbits. The larvae entered the upper gastrointestinal tract of the rabbits (esophagus and upper stomach), and then migrated upward into the buccal cavity- pharyngeal mucosa and tongue. A third molt took place 11 days after primary infection, and the final molt took place at 36 days after primary infection. Worms reached sexual maturity at about 8 weeks, and were found mostly in the esophagus of the rabbit. 72‚Äì81 days post primary infection, embryonated eggs appeared in the feces of the rabbits. Symptoms With initial infection, some patients have reported remembering a mild fever and flu-like symptoms about a month previous to extraction or identification of worm. The most common symptom is the complaint of sensation of a worm moving around the mouth, near the lips, and in the soft palate area. This movement is normally engendered by immature adult female worms. Symptoms, once noted, may continue from a month to a year if the worm is not surgically extracted. Eosinophilia is noted in some patients. Gongylonemiasis is the affliction caused by this parasite, which is simply protracted discomfort or sensation of movement in the buccal, oral or gingival areas associated with a sensation of foreign body. Subjects commonly pull worms from their gums, tongue, lips, and inner cheeks after days and even weeks of reported discomfort. In animals, this parasite quickly spreads down the esophagus, and into the upper digestive and respiratory tracts, making it more often than not, fatal. For humans, this parasite never makes it further than the oral cavity, and is often surgically or manually extracted. Diagnosis There is a danger of misdiagnosing infections of G. pulchrum as delusional parasitosis. Diagnosis is often made by visible recognition of the worm moving through the tissue of the buccal cavity by either patient or doctor. Also, recovery of worm from patient is also a diagnostic technique. Microscopic identification of worm removed from patient‚Äôs mouth or tissue is another diagnostic technique for determining the parasite infection. Treatment Treatment for infections with G. pulchrum is surgical/manual extraction of the noticed worm and albendazole (400 milligrams twice daily for 21 days). Follow up measures include periodic checks of buccal cavity and esophagus to ensure parasite infection has cleared. Epidemiology Infections of G. pulchrum are not a huge public health concern. There have only been 50 recorded infections worldwide since the first reported case in 1850.Haruki, K., Furuya, H., Saito, S., Kamiya, S. & Kagei, N. 2005: Gongylonema infection in man: A first case of gongylonemosis in Japan. Helminthologia, 42, 63-66. Free PDF The infections of G. pulchrum have been widespread, and countries reporting human infections include the United States, Germany, Iran, Japan, Laos, Morocco, China, Italy, New Zealand, and Egypt, among others. Control measures for reducing infections include making sure vector and larval contamination of food and water sources does not occur- this could be included in basic sanitary practices. Another control measure is ensuring children and adults do not accidentally or purposefully ingest infected dung beetles and other coprophagous insects. Case studies Serpentine path of Gongylonema pulchrum in the lip mucosa of a man In 1996, the first reported case of Gongylonema pulchrum infection was reported in Japan. A 34-year-old male complaining of irritable stomatitis on his lower lip went in to see his doctor, but the pain subsided spontaneously. However, it recurred several times in the next few months. When he went in to his doctor after one of these episodes, a thread like organism was seen protruding from his ulcer. The patient also had eosinophilia, but the ulcer healed with no scar once the organism was removed. The organism was identified as a female G. pulchrum worm, and the patient needed no further treatment. How the patient contracted the worm is still unknown. He didn‚Äôt report eating any abnormal foods, nor had he traveled outside Japan in the past few years. He also did not report drinking any water from possibly infected wells. It is possible that he ate food that had been contaminated in an endemic country and shipped to Japan. With the globalized food market now present, this is not out of the realm of possibility, and should be considered as a possible means of transmission into countries that have no previous history of G. pulchrum infection. In 1999, a 41-year-old female resident of New York City went in to her doctor complaining of the sensation of something moving in her mouth. She said she had had the feeling for the duration of one year. Supposedly, she had removed worms from her mouth on two separate occasions- one from her lip, and one from her gums. She submitted one of the specimens for microscopic identification, and it was found to be an adult female G. pulchrum worm. She traveled frequently to visit relatives in Mississippi, so it is unknown whether she contracted the worm in New York or in the south. This was the first reported case of Gongylonema in the United States since 1963. Also in 1999, a 38-year-old woman of Cambridge, Massachusetts sought medical attention for the visible identification of a ‚Äúmigrating mass‚Äù in her cheek mucosa. Six months earlier, she had noted an irregular patch of mucosa on her cheek, but thought nothing of it. Previously in the year, she‚Äôd traveled to Mexico, Guatemala, and France. She didn‚Äôt report ingesting any beetles, but she did eat raw foods when vacationing in Mexico. She described the foods as ‚Äúraw, crunchy, and saladlike‚Äù. Approximately 12 hours after eating the food, she and five other individuals she was traveling with had an acute attack of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. The symptoms seemed to resolve themselves with no need of further treatment. A small female Gongylonema worm was surgically removed from her cheek mucosa under local anesthesia, and follow up treatment included albendazole two times daily for three days. This was the eleventh reported case of G. pulchrum infection in the United States. Most cases reported in the US are reported from the southeastern part of the country. There was a 1916 infection reported in a 16-year-old girl from Mississippi. She presented with gastrointestinal pain, vomiting and a low fever (). She complained of a sensation of a worm moving around her lower lip, but was disregarded by her physician. As she continued to complain, the physician examined her mouth, and discovered the outline of a worm. He extracted the worm with a sewing needle, and the child‚Äôs complaints stopped and she appeared to have no further symptoms of parasite infection. In 2013, the first case of human gongylonemosis was reported in France. The patient, a healthy 48-year- old man felt the presence of a moving, worm-like organism in his mouth. Initially, the patient would occasionally feel, but not see, this mass at different sites: cheek, palate, gums and internal surface of the lower lip. The sensation would subside after several hours without leaving any visible lesions and without being accompanied by any associated localized or generalized symptoms. The patient had no medical history. He was a resident of Alsace, France, and had not travelled abroad. He reported not to have changed his lifestyle, especially not his diet, in the recent past. He also had no knowledge of having accidentally ingested an intermediate insect host. He consulted a doctor and all results of the clinical examination fell within the normal range. Haematology investigation revealed no abnormalities, particularly no elevated eosinophil count, and no microfilariae were seen using stained blood films; the filariasis serology was negative. No medical treatment was initiated. After 3 weeks of migration, the thread-like worm installed itself on the inner surface of the lower lip, allowing the patient to extract it by tongue pressure firstly, then using his fingers. He placed the parasite in alcohol and submitted it to a medical laboratory. Gallery These are all pictures from a single Gongylonema pulchrum male extracted from a man in France.

It was developed by Vicarious Visions, published by Activision, and released in June 2007 in North America, and July 2007 worldwide. The game is a Nintendo DS port of Transformers: The Game, and, unlike it, features only one campaign, focused entirerly on the Autobots; instead, a separate game, Transformers: Decepticons, which focuses entirerly on the Decepticons, was developed in parallel with Autobots and was also released in 2007. While mostly similar to Autobots, it has several missions taking place at a Qatar military base in the desert instead of Autobots' Arctic missions. Gameplay The game consists of four virtual locations, semi-destructible environments and enemies in the form of local law enforcement and opposing Transformers. \\"Hazard levels\\" denote the extent of attack the player character comes under based on how much destruction they perpetrate. Glowing spots on the map denote mission markers, which come in two varieties - twenty-three story missions, which further the game storyline, and thirty-four challenge missions, for players to test their skills. The game also features a slight RPG element in the form of XP, gained by destroying enemies and completing missions, which steadily increases players' levels (up to 20), unlocking new abilities and increasing stats. While a select number of missions allow players to take control of five of the Autobots or Decepticons featured in the movie, for the majority of the game, the player will control the \\"Create-A-Bot,\\" a customizable generic Transformer whose alternate mode the player can determine by scanning any one of over thirty-five vehicles found throughout the game locations.(You can also name your Create-A-Bot.) The games utilizes the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection for the \\"AllSpark Wars\\" online campaign, which pits players of the two different versions of the game against each other. Players are able to download one new special single player challenge each day and earn points upon its completion. Their score is then uploaded to a server at the end of the challenge and the side with the most points at the end of the day (Autobots or Decepticons) wins the \\"battle\\". The first side to win seven battles wins the overall \\"war\\" and a new war begins. However, if the Autobots and Decepticons win at least one piece each, a \\"tiebreaker match\\" will be played until the whole Allspark is under control of either side. Players earn Wi-Fi tokens for their involvement, which will unlock additional vehicles and cheats for use while playing the main game. Despite the aforementioned Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection support, multiplayer death-matches are limited to localized wireless play. There is also a secret form for the custom character called \\"Skydive,\\" which is countered by G1 Starscream, a somewhat improved Starscream, in the Decepticons game; both can be obtained by earning 2500 tokens through Wi-Fi play. Synopsis = Setting = The game focuses on the eponymus Transformers, a race of extraterrestrials from the planet Cybertron who resemble robots and can change their form into various vehicles, such as tanks or jets. The Transformers are divided into two factions, the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons, and arrived on Earth following a civil war that left their home planet a deserted and lifeless place. Forced to disguise themselves by taking the form of human vehicles, the Transformers soon reenact their past conflict upon learning that the AllSpark, a powerful artifact and the source of all Transformer life, is on Earth; while the Decepticons seek its power to subjugate the Earth, the Autobots attempt to save the planet from this threat and make peace with mankind. =Characters= * Create-A-Bot (voiced by Steven Blum) - the player's own customizable character, portrayed as an Autobot rookie who seeks to prove himself to his superiors. * Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) - the wise, heroic, and inspiring leader of the Autobots who transforms into a 1997 Peterbilt 379 semi-truck. * Bumblebee - a recon officer and scout who transforms into a 1977 Chevrolet Camaro and communicates through the radio as his vocal processors were damaged by Megatron. * Ironhide (voiced by Mark Ryan) - the Autobots' weapon specialist who first mentors the player when they arrive on Earth. He transforms into a GMC Topkick pickup truck. * Jazz (voiced by Andrew Kishino) - the Autobots' second-in-command who transforms into a Pontiac Solstice GXP Weekend Racer Concept. * Ratchet (voiced by Fred Tatasciore) - the Autobots' medical officer who transforms into a Search and Rescue Hummer H2. He is the only Autobot who the player doesn't have any personal interaction with throughout the game. =Plot= Upon landing on Earth, the Autobot rookie \\"Create-A-Bot\\" undergoes a basic systems check, under Ironhide's coordination, before defeating several Decepticons, including the Create-A-Bot from Transformers Decepticons, and taking on the form of a vehicle he scans. Aferwards, he arrives in Tranquility, where Optimus Prime teaches him to value the lives of the humans that all Autobots are sworn to protect, before meeting with Bumblebee, who has him scan additional vehicles, as well as the internet for information on a pair of glasses with a Decepticon code imprinted onto them. After informing the Create-A-Bot that both the Decepticon leader Megatron and the AllSpark might be on Earth, Bumblebee leaves to retrieve the glasses, only to discover the Decepticon Barricade has already claimed them. Bumblebee pursues and ultimately defeats Barricade, before learning from a news article that a \\"giant metal man\\" was found frozen in the Arctic. The Create-A-Bot goes there and meets with Ironhide, before discovering that a human military organization called Sector 7 found Megatron and had him imprisoned at their base there, but later moved him to an unknown location. They also discover an encrypted file titled \\"Project: Ice Man\\" which they send to Optimus, before being attacked by the Decepticon second-in-command Starscream, whom Ironhide defeats. Returning to Tranquility, the pair rendezvous with Bumblebee, who has discovered that Sector 7 had adapted Megatron's technology into automated defenses which they have set up all over town. Once Bumblebee destroys them, Optimus Prime arrives on Earth with Jazz and Ratchet, and sends Jazz to retrieve several Sector 7 vehicles for analysis, one of which turns out to be Decepticon Blackout. After driving him off, Jazz meets with Optimus and they learn through the data they've retrieved that Sector 7 has both Megatron and the AllSpark kept hidden inside the Hoover Dam. Vowing to destroy his former brother, Optimus orders Bumblebee to distract Sector 7's forces, allowing the other Autobots to escape, though when Create-A-Bot recklessly tries to help, Bumblebee gets himself captured while saving him. When Optimus decides to focus on retrieving the AllSpark rather than saving Bumblebee, Ironhide angrily accuses him of caring only about destroying Megatron, though he later apologizes. At the Hoover Dam, Jazz hacks into Sector 7's computer systems and learns where Bumblebee is being kept, before Create-A-Bot is sent to rescue him. Bumblebee reveals that he knows where the AllSpark is, and retrieves it along with his weapon chip, before meeting with Optimus, though they are intercepted by Barricade when they try to leave the dam. Optimus battles and kills him, but with his final words, Barricade reveals he was merely a distraction, allowing the other Decepticons to free Megaron. Ironhide and the Create-A-Bot eavesdrop on the Decepticons and learn that they've placed bombs on the dam, which the former disarms, while Optimus goes after Megatron. He is intercepted by Brawl, but quickly dispatches of him. The Autobots head back to Tranquility with the AllSpark, pursued by the Decepticons. Blackout goes after Bumblebee, but is killed by Ratchet. Megatron soon shows up and takes the AllSpark, wounding Bumblebee in the process. Optimus then attempts to take him on alone, but Megatron uses the AllSpark to create drones that attack him. The Create-A-Bot arrives and manages to get the AllSpark away from Megatron, shoving it into his chest, which mortally wounds him as well. Optimus proceeds to battle the injured Megatron, ultimately killing him and destroying the AllSpark. Before he dies, the Create-A-Bot tells Optimus to make Earth the Autobots' new home. Optimus mourns his death and later honors his last wish by sending a message into space for any surviving Autobots to join them on Earth before driving off into the sunset with Bumblebee, Ratchet, and Ironhide.

The properties were held for investment purposes and not primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business and therefore warranted capital gains treatment under Internal Revenue Code sections 1201 and 1202.  The Fifth Circuit Court's reasoning  ‚Ä¢ Byram made no personal effort to initiate the sales, he did not advertise, he did not have a sales office, he did not enlist the aid of brokers, he did not improve or develop the land, and he devoted minimal time and effort to the transactions. ‚Ä¢ The court determined that the standard for review from the district court‚Äôs finding must be accepted unless it is clearly erroneous ‚Ä¢ The district court did not clearly err in determining that 22 sales in 3 years were not sufficiently frequent or continuous to compel an inference of intent to hold the property for sale rather than investment ‚Ä¢ Substantial and frequent sales activity standing alone has never been held to be automatically sufficient to trigger ordinary income treatment ‚Ä¢ A court should avoid placing too much weight on duration of ownership where other indicia of intent to hold the property for sale are minimal in order to follow Congressional intent.  Notes  ‚Ä¢ Capital Asset: property held by the taxpayer not including property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business 7 Pillars of Capital Gain Treatment (1) the nature and purpose of the acquisition of the property and the duration of the ownership; (2) the extent and nature of the taxpayer's efforts to sell the property; (3) the number, extent, continuity and substantiality of the sales; (4) the extent of subdividing, developing, and advertising to increase sales; (5) the use of a business office for the sale of the property; (6) the character and degree of supervision or control exercised by the taxpayer over any representative selling the property; and (7) the time and effort the taxpayer habitually devoted to the sales.  Importance  The takeaway from this case, and the reason it is important to everyday investors, is that Byram demonstrated that if you want to sell property AND obtain favorable capital gains treatment, it is essential that you consider the 7 Pillars of Capital Gain Treatment and attempt to stay on the ‚ÄúByram‚Äù Side of the line. If you begin to deviate, such as having a business office, or subdividing the land, or spending a significant amount of time and effort on sales, the court may disallow capital gains treatment on the sale of property.

The first step in this direction was the creation of the Engineering in Aquaculture, which offered tuition since 1993, an initiative with the University Andres Bello became the first private university that implemented a program of greater complexity, assuming the responsibility to comply with the requirements of infrastructure and equipment that demand this type of project. Associated with this teaching program, simultaneously born Marine Research Center located in the Caleta de Quintay, now proud of their level of development, scientific and technical successes have been achieved in many of their research projects, and their valuable work in support of numerous inlets of fishermen. Andres Bello University, through the Marine Research Center, has become the leading provider of seeds of sea urchins in the country, and the creator, among others, the sole technology that grow in captivity, opening an opportunity to negotiate services to the private sector, which could become equivalent to salmon farming. In the seventh year of its founding in 1996, when the University had nearly six thousand students and offered thirteen specializations, the founding partners Luis Cordero, Ignacio Fernandez and Marcelo Ruiz, versus distance from the other founding partners are in charge of the property University and reorganize the project partners incorporated as supporters to Mr. Alvaro Saieh, Miguel Angel Poduje, Selume Jorge Andres Navarro and Juan Antonio Guzman. Thus, these eight holders become part of the Board and convene a group of leading academics and scientists to join the project meet the definition of its mission to address more vigorously the demands imposed by the knowledge society give him a new organizational structure and form a new university governance. This period is especially important the participation of prominent lawyers and public men, M√°ximo Pacheco G√≥mez and William Elton Alamos, who alternate in the Vice President of the Board, making a great contribution to the project, and academics, Joaqu√≠n Barcel√≥ and Manuel Krauskopf, who come to defog after ownership of the rectory.  New institutional mission and autonomy  In this period, the University assumes the main recommendations of the Chilean Board of Higher Education. Moreover, placing greater demands self-organizational and academic excellence recommended by the watchdog. Strengthens organically through a structure based on superior academic units and basic, also incorporating new academic teams in the core disciplines, allowing you to configure the first research centers participating in the National Science and Technology (FONDECYT, FONDEF, FONTEC and others). In Tables academic influence in the areas of science stressed under the experience gained in the Marine Research Center Quintay, creating an area of biological sciences, increasingly incorporating doctors in Jor-nothing regime complete. Later, the same is done in the areas of chemistry, physics, mathematics, philosophy and history. It is undoubtedly the construction of the indicated areas which marks the seal structure and academic development of the Universidad Andr√©s Bello. The strength of its areas of Basic Sciences announces the solid and rapid growth will thereafter. Indeed, the strengthening of research created the conditions and atmosphere of competitiveness and excellence that helped create more complex programs, embodied in careers as medicine and dentistry, as well as degrees in Philosophy and History. This development also included a full program of Bachelor of Science and Humanities and the incursion into numerous other health careers, supported by extensive clinical agreements with various public and private fields. This allowed us to begin new careers ensuring the proper development of each of the ten biomedical programs offered by the university today, through the most comprehensive Faculty of Health Sciences and Dentistry of the private system. Similarly, in the same period began the development of graduate programs, with many graduates, masters and doctoral highly complex personalities by the world des sciences.  Internationalization and accreditation  From 2000 onwards, after reaching full autonomy, the University Andres Bello becomes the leading private university in the country. Each year shows a significant increase in students with indirect fiscal contributions, government subsidy that rewards the 27,500 best scores from the University Selection Test-, college becomes more achievements in the field of research, and is the private only part of three of the nine programs funded by the government Millennium in order to support the development of highly competitive research in the country has held since then, the first among private universities, both in publications indexed and quantity of time teachers and has a complete infrastructure for teaching, research and extension. However, to achieve a position of greater excellence and be able to join the select group of universities and small high complexity that exist today in Chile, the University still required increased investment and resources, as well as effective international links, that make available the benefits of globalization to all members of its academic community. After evaluating alternatives, Chileans elected holders as a strategic partner to Laureate Education Consortium, bringing together two essential attributes for this alliance was an opportunity to have a significant financial contribution and, on the other hand, as a portfolio of academic experiences prestige in Europe and the United States accumulated through a network of universities and educational institutions, all accredited by agencies specializing in quality assurance. Thus, Laureate Education Consortium, through various educational projects held in Chile and are aimed at different segments of higher education, has reached an important presence in the country's higher education, transcends offer programs ranging from technical education to higher education more demanding and prestige. The internationalization of the University, has allowed its undergraduate and graduate students to validate and complete their studies abroad, programs addressing the double titling and incorporate English as a second language in all their careers. This objective, involved in a very short-term consolidation of a Department of English to serve the entire university community, and create a modern career with the best technological support to graduate teachers of this language in the context of national and international experiences. The U. Andr√©s Bello, in 2003, was the first private university to adhere to the establishment of a national system of quality assurance in Chile, whose purpose is prudential institutions of higher education provision, in the processes that develop mechanisms to ensure the compliance of academic standards of quality and continuous improvement. The university was one of the first three institutionally accredited private universities in Chile, for the period between 2004 and 2008, a certification that came to reaffirm the Andr√©s Bello University is part of a select group of ten universities most complex and successful national system of higher education, even though it is one of the youngest in the country. All this is confirmed in the successes achieved in gradual accreditation of each of its undergraduate programs, and especially in the accreditation of their degrees, an area where the University Andres Bello shows an undisputed leadership in the amount and complexity of the programs offered, and have also begun to be accredited by their merits and achievements. The year 2007 reaches the university in a first level course in terms of prestige, in all private universities, and in many ways, ahead of many traditional universities. In 2008, the University, with an enrollment of around 30,000 students, ranks as a national benchmark, which leads her to decide to open a place of conception, at the beginning of the academic year 2009, as the only way provide opportunities to students in the south, to have an alternative that is certainly chosen by many students from diverse sectors of the country. The University Andres Bello corroborated by that act which is a university of national characteristics, inserted in the national ideology and strongly committed to developing human and social capital that shapes the Chilean identity. The university is accredited internationally by MSCHE.  Corporate seal  In his short but fruitful existence, the University has added to its corporate seal search for academic excellence, commitment to research, the option to address all areas of knowledge and effective addition to globalization, also as an element characteristic, its decision to recognize excellence and the contribution they make to developing great personalities and well-being of humanity. Thus, education also contributes to the formation of values in its students through generous recognition of the success and merits legitimate, who, in a remarkable manner, has devoted his life to studying, teaching, the research or public service.

They can be used as teaching aids during the lectures that follow each of the Masonic Degrees, when an experienced member explains the various concepts of Freemasonry to new members. They can also be used by experienced members as reminders of the concepts they learned as they went through the ceremonies of the different masonic degrees. History and development A Third Degree tracing board =Floor and table designs= In the eighteenth century Masonic lodges met chiefly in private rooms above taverns, and the symbolic designs used in catechesis were chalked on the table or floor in the centre of the hired room, usually by the Tyler or the Worshipful Master. Evidence suggests that a simple boundary was drawn (usually a square or rectangle, or sometimes a cross) within which various Masonic symbols were added, often of a geometric type (such as a circle or pentagram). In many lodges the boundary shape may have been drawn by the Tyler, with the Master adding the symbolic detail. Later various symbolic objects were incorporated, examples including a ladder, a beehive, and an hourglass, and sometimes drawings were interchangeable with physical objects. At the end of the work a new member was often required to erase the drawing with a mop, as a practical demonstration of his obligation of secrecy. Though the various Grand Lodges were then generally hostile to the creation of any physical representations of the ritual and symbols of the Craft, the time- consuming business of redrawing the symbols at every meeting was gradually replaced by keeping a removable \\"floor cloth\\" on which the various symbols were painted. Different portions might be exposed according to the work being executed. By the second half of the eighteenth century the Masonic symbols were being painted on a variety of removable materials ranging from small marble slabs to canvas, to give a more decorative and elaborate symbolic display. =Painted boards= During the nineteenth century there was a rapid expansion of the use of permanent painted tracing boards, usually painted on canvas and framed in wood. Many artists produced competing designs, and most lodges commissioned sets of bespoke boards which were therefore of a unique design, despite following common themes. Some designs became particularly popular, leading to some repetition of favoured design features. Boards by John Cole and Josiah Bowring were examples of popularly recurring designs. The English artist John Harris was initiated in 1818 and produced many different series of tracing boards, including a miniature set of 1823 which became popular after Harris dedicated the design to Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, the Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE). Eventually the Emulation Lodge of Improvement sought to bring a measure of standardisation in tracing board design, and organised a competition in 1845, to which many different designs were submitted. Harris himself submitted at least two different sets to the competition, but one of his designs was the winner. Harris revised the designs in 1849, and these \\"Emulation\\" tracing boards are today considered a definitive design within British and Commonwealth Freemasonry. Contemporary use In lodges under the UGLE, and many jurisdictions derived from English Freemasonry, tracing boards are an essential part of lodge furniture, sometimes displayed flat on the floor, and sometimes vertically against a pedestal or on the wall. Sets of three boards, usually of older designs, may often be found in special cases for storage and display within lodge rooms. There are sometimes tracing boards in other degrees. The Royal Arch tracing board has fallen into disuse in most places, and examples are now rare. In the Mark Master Mason and Royal Ark Mariner degrees as administered from London, the tracing boards have experienced a great revival in popularity from the end of the twentieth century, and official rituals for the explanations of these tracing boards are again in regular use in English lodges. As different Masonic jurisdictions established official, or standard, degree rituals the creation of new tracing boards by artists waned, and has since largely disappeared in favour of standard designs. Nonetheless, some masonic artists have experimented with very modern designs for the twenty-first century.

It opened in 1886 and closed in 1947. The track gauge was a narrow gauge. The formal name of the company was The West Carberry Tramways and Light Railways Company Ltd. Route Ballydehob Viaduct across Roaringwater Bay The S&S;'s main line was 15 ¬Ω miles long. It was one of several in Ireland built under the terms of the Tramways Act 1883. It largely ran alongside roads, although a large 12-arched masonry viaduct was built over an inlet of Roaringwater Bay. The line linked the small harbour and village at Schull (in Irish: Scoil Mhuire) with the town of Skibbereen (An Sciobair√≠n). The only sizeable intermediate village was Ballydehob (B√©al √Åtha an d√° Chab), although the station was located inconveniently far from the village. The line was single track, with a passing place at Ballydehob station. Other halts were built at Newcourt, Church Cross, Hollyhill, Kilcoe and Woodlands (of which only Hollyhill had a station building). The station at Skibbereen was built on a cramped site adjacent to that of the Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway. The S&S; trains had to reverse out of the station into a headshunt, before proceeding towards Schull. (A similar reversing operation is still required at Killarney railway station on Iarnr√≥d √âireann's line from Mallow to Tralee). Early years Construction was begun in 1885 and soon proved to be substandard. The Inspector of Railways refused to allow the line to be opened for public service in August 1886. Following some remedial work and a subsequent inspection, the line opened in September with a restricted speed limit of only 15 miles per hour. In October the service had to be suspended for 10 days owing to problems with both the track and the locomotives. Services had to again be suspended in April 1887, with local ratepayers having to subsidise the company. The Inspector of Railways gave a highly critical report of the line's standards of operation. Following further losses, in 1892 the Grand Jury of County Cork appointed a committee of management to run the line. In 1893 a short extension to Schull Pier was built. Ownership by the GSR and CI√â In 1925 the company was incorporated into the new Great Southern Railways. Owing to a shortage of coal during World War II (known as The Emergency in neutral Ireland), services had to be suspended between April 1944 and December 1945. In 1945 the GSR was incorporated into C√≥ras Iompair √âireann (CI√â). A further shortage of coal resulted in a renewed suspension of services on 27 January 1947. The line never reopened; CI√â formally abandoned the railway in September 1952.

Written by Jose Luis Lopez Linares, it is based on Adelaida Garc√≠a Morales' short novel of the same name. As in the novella, the screenplay takes place solely in the north of Spain, however the novella picks up where the screenplay leaves off, taking Estrella on a journey to the south of Spain. Producer El√≠as Querejeta decided not to allow the filming of the latter 90 minutes which would have been filmed in the south. Querejeta contributed it to lack of funds, although neither Erice nor the film's cinematographer, Jos√© Luis Alcaine, believed that was the reason. Erice felt the film was incomplete and described it as an \\"unfinished drama\\" even though it was well received by critics. Plot This film tells the story of a young girl named Estrella (Sonsoles Aranguren), living in the north of Spain with her father, Augustin (Omero Antonutti), and her mother, Julia (Lola Cardona). Her father is a scientist who seemingly has the ability to divine water using a pendulum, but Estrella finds him mysterious. As she's growing up her father shares with her the art of divination, but does not talk about his own childhood. Her grandmother comes to visit, and she learns that during the Spanish Civil War her father and grandfather had a falling out. Her grandfather supported Franco, but her father was a Republican. After the civil war her father vowed he would never return to the south again. Later she sees her father visit a movie theater, then eventually discovers that the films he patronizes all star an actress by the name of Irene Rios (Aurore Cl√©ment). She later finds out that Rios was her father's sweetheart in the south, and that he is still in love with her.

Life He was the eldest son of Thomas FitzMaurice FitzGerald (died 1271) and Rohesia de St. Michel. He is noticed in 1291 in serious dispute with William Vescy, Lord of Kildare, Lord Justice of Ireland, about whom there were many complaints of oppression and neglect of the country's defences. As champion of the complainants John Fitzgerald, by then 4th Lord of Offaly (having succeeded to the title in 1287, upon the death of his uncle Maurice FitzGerald, 3rd Lord of Offaly), their paths crossed and instead of addressing the issues Vescy charged Fitzgerald with minor charges of slander and libel. Fitzgerald appealed to King Edward I of England, who, to examine and judge the matter impartially, summoned them both to London to hear the cases, where it appears FitzGerald had the advantage, challenging the Lord Justice to clear his name by combat, which was accepted. However, Vescy fled to France, whereupon the King pronounced Lord Offaly innocent, and settled upon him Vescy's lordships and manors of Kildare, Rathangan, &c.;, had been forfeited to the Crown.Webb, Alfred.

March was a steam locomotive shed under British Railways with the depot code 31B; the depot code of the diesel depot under BR was MR. The nearest railway station is March, and the depot was located close to the Whitemoor Marshalling Yard. Despite its rural location, in the 1970s it accommodated a similar number of locomotives to the comparatively larger Toton TMD and served as the main diesel depot for East Anglia.Album 13D March Depot History March Shed was built by the Great Eastern Railway as part of the redevelopment of local railway facilities in the mid-1880s, when the construction of a new, larger station at March had meant that the earlier engine shed had had to be demolished. Construction of the new shed included realigning the branch line to Wisbech further west and replacing a level crossing at Norwood Road with a bridge.March's railway history The new shed was a brick built 6 track straight shed with a triple gable style slate roof. It was provided with the 2 northerly roads as through and the other 4 roads dead-ended on the west side. In 1900 a turntable was provided on the north side of the shed yard, being enlarged to 70 foot in 1925 when a corrugated asbestos clad 4 track straight through shed was added along the north side of the original building. After the 1923 Grouping the London and North Eastern Railway built a new locomotive shed in Hundred Road with a Mitchell Conveyor and Transporter Co mechanical coaling plant for the engines, with an associated electricity generating plant. The entire line became part of the Great Eastern Railway in 1862.MNR history of the line The former GER engine shed was retained to undertake heavy repairs. A brick built 5 track straight through washout shed was added in 1933.Engine Sheds and Locomotive Depots of Britain: March A water softener with a capacity of 11,700 gallons per hour was added in 1939, at a cost of over ¬£12,000. =World War Two= March Shed was considered of strategic importance in both operational and national level. The LNER diesel shunters, locomotives which included a large switching board at the rear of the cab to enable them to be used as mobile power stations in the event of bomb damage affecting local supplies, were delivered new to March. Due to locomotive examination problems caused by the wartime blackout the shed was provided with an Illuminated Loco Inspection Pit, generally referred to as the Light Tunnel. This building contained six rows of tube lights, two on either wall and one on either side of the pit. This building remained in use until the end of steam. During the Second World War a number of US Army Class S160 (USATC S160 Class) 2-8-0s were allocated to the shed during 1943 and 1944 in the run up to the invasion of Europe. =Dieselisation= With the arrival of diesel shunters, Roads 1 and 2 were dedicated for their use. As more diesel locomotives entered service the first four roads were partitioned off, with all diesel maintenance and repairs taking place there. Forty Brush Type 2 diesels were based at the depot by the early 1960s. Diesel locomotives were fuelled on site despite the lack of spillage trays and the timber beams of the old steam shed. In 1962 a steel- framed diesel depot was built on the site of the original shed, complete with spillage trays and oil drainage facilities. In 1987, the 4 track extension to the original shed was also demolished and replaced by a purpose built diesel facility. The depot was closed in 1992 with the withdrawal of remaining Speedlink (wagon load traffic). This meant that the depot had no work. Class 66s stabled However, in 2003, Whitemoor Yard re-opened and on 18 April 2008 GB Railfreight (a freight operating company and part of FirstGroup) officially opened their new depot at March.

Audentius attended three regional councils, at Riez (439), Orange (441), and Vaison (442). After them are mentioned: St. Petronius, followed by his brother St. Marcellus (c. 463), confessor and miracle-worker; Lucretius (541‚Äì573), to whom St. Ferreolus of Uzes dedicated his monastic rule. For various reasons Abb√© Jules Chevalier omits from the episcopal list: St. Maximus (sixth century); Wulphinus (end of eighth century); Exuperius and Saturninus (ninth century). Other bishops were: Hugh (1073‚Äì83), consecrated at Rome by Gregory VII, became a papal legate of the latter, presided over numerous councils for the reform of the Church, and subsequently became Bishop of Lyon; Ismido (1098‚Äì1115) of the noble house of Sassenage; Uric (1129‚Äì42), who opposed the Petrobrusian heresy in his diocese and became a Carthusian; Blessed Bernard (1173‚Äì76); Stephen (1203‚Äì1208), formerly a Carthusian at the monastery of Portes; Blessed Didier (Desiderius) de Lans (1213‚Äì20). The Cathedral of Die was dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. The Cathedral Chapter had two dignities, the Dean and the Sacristan, and ten other Canons. Ritzler, VI, p. 195 note 1. The Dean, Sacristan and Chapter are mentioned in the thirteenth century pouill√©. In the thirteenth century the diocese was divided for administrative purposes into four Archpresbyteries: the Archpriest of Die, the Archpriest of Trivilis (Tri√®ves), the Archpriest of Deserto, the Archpriest of Crista.Chevalier (1868), \\"Septi√®me Livraison: Polypticha, id est Regesta Taxationum Beneficiorum...\\", pp. 43‚Äì52. There was a Collegiate Church at Crest (Crista) dedicated to Saint-Sauveur, which had a Provost, a Cantor, and six Canons.Piganiol de la Force, p. 384. F√©lix Gr√©goire, \\"Un torrent, la Dr√¥me,\\" After the eleventh century the Diocese of Die, long disputed between the metropolitans of Vienne and Arles, became suffragan of the archbishopric of Vienne. On 28 March 1165 Pope Alexander III confirmed by papal bull the grant to the Church of Die on the part of Arnaud de CrestC.U.J. Chevalier (1868), pp. 33‚Äì35. and Guillaume of PoitiersC.U.J.

The bull also confirms the possession of the entire city of Die and nine castle- towns including Crista.C.U.J. Chevalier (1868), pp. xiii and 20‚Äì22. By Papal Bull of 25 September 1275,Jean Giraud (ed.), Les Registres de Gregoire X (1272-1276) (Paris: Thorin 1892), pp. 272‚Äì273 no. 637. in order to strengthen the Church of Valence in its struggle with the House of Poitiers, Gregory X united the Diocese of Die with that of Valence. Five days later, on 30 September, Pope Gregory wrote to Abbot Amadeus of Roussillon, informing him that he had been named Bishop of Valence in succession to Bishop Guy, who had died in 1272.J. Chevalier (1888), pp. 406‚Äì408. Amadeus of Roussillon was the brother of the Archbishop of Lyon, Adhemar de Roussillon (1273‚Äì1283): Eubel, I, p. 316. It was no accident that Amadeus of Roussillon was the nephew of Amadeus of Geneva, Bishop of Die. Amadeus of Roussillon was present at the bedside of his uncle when he made his Testament on 21 January 1276.Amadeus of Geneva named as his universal heir his nephew, Aymon the Count of Geneva. J. Chevalier (1888), p. 409. Bishop Amadeus of Die died on 22 October 1276, and his nephew Amadeus of Roussillon became Bishop of Valence and Die. This union, which lasted four centuries, was unfortunate for the Church in Die. The Huguenot sect, derived from the Calvinism of Geneva, had taken firm hold in the Dauphin√©, and in particular in the Alpine valleys. In order to combat Protestantism, therefore, King Louis XIV, published the Edict of Fontainebleau on 22 October 1685, revoking the special rights granted to Protestants in France in the Edict of Nantes. King Louis revived the diocese of Die and appointed a Bishop of Die in 1687. From the point of view of the Roman Catholic Church, however, the union of the two dioceses was dissolved canonically in the Consistory of 7 July 1692 by Pope Innocent XII.Ritzler, V, p. 184 note 1, and 403 note 1. On 10 September 1692, the Bishop of Die, Armand de Montmorin Saint-H√©rem, had an interview with James II of England and Louis XIV. Asked for a report on the state of the Dauphin√©, inter alia the Bishop reported that Die was entirely in the hands of the Huguenots.The report of the interview is printed by M. de Die ... (dit qu')il y'a beaucoup d'Huguenots dans le Dauphin√©, et que la ville de Die l'est toute enti√®re. In 1790 the Civil Constitution of the Clergy reduced the number of dioceses in France from 135 to 83, and ordered that they be coterminous with the new d√©partments of the civil organization. Each d√©partment was authorized and ordered to elect its own bishop; the electors did not have to be Catholic, and that fact alone created a schism between the Constitutional Church and Constitutional Bishops and the Roman Catholic Church. Bishop Gaspard-Alexis Plan des Augiers protested, and then fled his diocese; he died in exile in Rome in 1794. On 21 February 1791, the Constitutional diocese of Dr√¥me elected Fran√ßois Marbos, cur√© of the parish of Bourg-lez-Valence as their 'bishop'. He was consecrated in Paris on 3 April 1791, by Jean Baptiste Gobel of Paris, assisted by Bishops Mirodot and Gouttes. After the Concordat of 1801 he retracted his errors, and died in communion with Rome in 1825. Bishops =to 1276= *Nicaise : 325Bishop Nicasius was present at the Council of Nicaea in 325.

This type of compressor uses a special drive to control the speed (RPM) of the unit, which in turn saves energy compared to a fixed speed equivalent. This is done to improve the efficiency of the compressor as varying the displacement or compression ratio of a compressor generally introduces significant inefficiency, or is impractical to implement. The most common form of VSD technology in the air compressor industry is a variable-frequency drive, which converts the incoming AC power to DC and then back to a quasi-sinusoidal AC power using an inverter switching circuit. The variable-frequency drive article provides additional information on electronic speed controls used with various types of AC motors. Benefits The benefits of this technology included reducing power cost, reducing power surges (from starting AC motors), and delivering a more constant pressure. The down side of this technology is the heavy expense associated with the drive, and the sensitivity of these drives ‚Äì specifically to heat and moisture. Industry Typically a fifth of a factory's electricity bill is attributed to the production of compressed air. The majority of modern factories are heavily involved in cutting costs, and energy awareness should be a key concern. For example, 10‚Äì12% of all power generated in the UK is dedicated to the production of compressed air, and a portion of this power is wasted energy. Large electrical cost savings can be achieved by installing a variable speed drive compressor in place of an existing rotary screw or piston machine. Because of this, many governments, including the US and UK, are pushing the industries to move towards this technology in hopes of reducing wasted energy. Governments offer various incentives, such as tax rebates or interest free loans, to cover the upgrades. However, variable speed drive compressors are not necessarily appropriate for all industrial applications. If a variable speed drive compressor operates continuously at full speed, the switching losses of the frequency converter result in a lower energy efficiency than an otherwise identically sized fixed speed compressor. Where demand remains constant within 5‚Äì15% of the total free air delivery flow rate, dual-control compressors configured in a split solution can provide higher efficiency than a VSD. A professional air audit is the best way to identify if a VSD compressor is most appropriate for any given compressed air application. These audits are available from various companies that specialize in the implementation of compressed air equipment, which can determine the most efficient controls for a compressed air system ‚Äì including variable speed, variable capacity or using storage and flow controllers.

Genetz was born in Impilahti, Finland (now in the Republic of Karelia). He became professionally employed as a language teacher, but gained prominence for his choral compositions. After studying chemistry and law at the University of Helsinki, he became a singer in the Finnish Opera, and traveled on a state grant to study at the Dresden Conservatory from 1875 to 1877. He spent time in various cities of Finland, including Hameenlinna, Helsinki, and Hamina, working as a German language teacher, composing patriotic works, and conducting choirs. He died in Helsinki in 1930. Many of his works are still well known in modern Finland. James Fuld in his The Book of World-Famous Music points out that the first two measures of Genetz' Her√§√§ Suomi! (Arise Finland!) for male chorus, published in 1882, are almost identical with the main tune of Jean Sibelius' Finlandia of 1900, during which time the Grand Duchy of Finland was part of the Russian Empire, which makes one consider how blatantly revolutionary against the Czarist regime Sibelius' wordless orchestral piece was.

Typically, photoplay editions were reprints of novels additionally illustrated with scenes from a film production. Less typically, photoplay editions were novelizations of films, where the film script was fictionalized in narrative form. Today, vintage photoplay editions are sought after by film buffs, bibliophiles, and collectors. The first photoplay editions were published around 1912, and as a genre, they reached their height in the 1920s and 1930s. Thousands of different titles were issued in the United States. Most photoplays were published in hardback by companies like Grosset & Dunlap or A. L. Burt, and some in soft cover by companies like Jacobsen Hodgkinson. Similar movie related books were also published in England, France and elsewhere. Typically, photoplay editions of the 1920s and 1930s contained stills and/or a dust jacket featuring artwork or actors from a film. Deluxe editions might also contain a special binding, illustrated end papers or, rarely, a written introduction by the star of the film. Sometimes, the spine or cover of the book will note the edition is a \\"photoplay edition.\\" Illustrated movie tie-in books continued to be published though the 1940s, 1950s, and into the 1960s. Today, novels published in conjunction with the release of a film will often feature an actor or actress on the cover of the book, but without the interior illustrations. Today, the most sought after photoplays are those tie-in editions for favorite films such as Dracula, Frankenstein and King Kong, or lost films such as London After Midnight. Other collectors search for books featuring individuals stars, like Louise Brooks or Rudolph Valentino. Published by Grosset & Dunlap in 1927, The General is today one of the most sought after of photoplay books. Not only did the Joseph Warren novel make its first appearance in print as a photoplay, but the book is the only photoplay edition to feature film star Buster Keaton.  Guidebooks  Emil Petaja's Photoplay Edition was the first book published on the subject. Photoplay Edition (SISU, 1975), by the noted science fiction and fantasy author Emil Petaja, was the first book on the subject. Petaja based the book on his collection of photoplays, which at the time of publication numbered more than eight hundred. Petaja had owned many rare examples, including a few autographed by film stars. Petaja's Photoplay Edition is composed of a checklist of books, with each entry detailing the book's movie title (which sometimes differed from the title of the novel), as well as its author, publisher, date of release, the motion picture company which produced the film, its leading actors, and the number of illustrations included within the book. Illustrating Petaja's guide are dozens of dust jackets and scene stills, each of which graced the original editions. Petaja also offers a short prologue, a longer history of photoplay books, and an anecdotal chapter telling the story of the author's involvement in collecting these books. Photoplay Edition has been surpassed by later, more comprehensive, illustrated guides. These include Arnie Davis' Photoplay Editions and Other Movie Tie-In Books (Mainely Books, 2002), and Rick Miller's Photoplay Editions: A Collector's Guide (McFarland, 2002). Each list more than the 800 examples found in Petaja's pioneering guide. Thomas Mann's Horror and Mystery Photoplay Editions and Magazine Fictionizations (McFarland, 2004) examines genre editions.

John McGillis was the heir to his uncle Hugh McGillis (1767‚Äì1848), one of the partners in the North West Company, who bought the house of Sir John Johnson, 2nd Baronet in Williamstown, Ontario, which John McGillis inherited and where the future Mrs Harwood was brought up. Harwood's sister, Marie-Louise, also married into the McGillis family. Her husband, Antoine Eustache de Bellefeuille MacDonald was a son of Emily McGillis, Mrs Harwood's aunt. MacDonald was a brother-in-law of William McGillivray, nephew of Simon McTavish and Sir Archibald Campbell, 1st Baronet. Harwood died at his home in Vaudreuil, Quebec at the age of 70. His son, Charles-Auguste de Lotbiniere-Harwood (1869‚Äì1954) of Vaudreuil, married Marie- Adelaide Masson, granddaughter of Joseph Masson of Manoir Terrebonne, Quebec. His daughter, Marie-Elizabeth de Lotbiniere-Harwood (1859‚Äì1951), married Major-General Sir Sam Steele of Lord Strathcona's Horse.

It is a catalyst for African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Native Americans to return to academia to earn their doctorates and become business professors. History In 1993, a group of academics and corporate representatives sharing a concern for the lack of diversity in corporate hiring pools sought a solution. Over the next several months they initiated a systemic and fundamental program to correct a major problem: U.S. business school faculties consisted of less than two percent minorities. With no faculty of color in the front of the classroom, colleges and universities could not attract minorities to study business disciplines. There were no role models and an absence of natural and approachable mentors. Something needed to be done. In response to this overwhelming need, The PhD Project was created. The founding members were The KPMG Foundation, The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), Citigroup and the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC). The KPMG Foundation administers The Project and is the principal source of annual funding. The program has been the principal reason for the increase in the number of African-American, Hispanic-American and Native American business school professors: in 1994 there were 294 minority business school professors, today there are 889. Furthermore, there are 412 members of these underrepresented groups now in doctoral programs that will lead to positions as professors. Vision The PhD Project‚Äôs vision is a significantly larger pool of highly qualified African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Native Americans for positions in management. The PhD Project‚Äôs mission is to increase the diversity of corporate America by increasing the diversity of business school faculty. The PhD Project attracts African-Americans, Hispanic- Americans and Native Americans to business Ph.D. programs, and provides a network of peer support on their journey to becoming professors. As faculty, they serve as role models attracting and mentoring minority students while improving the preparation of all students for a diverse workplace and society. Objectives The main objectives of The PhD Project are: * To inform and educate minorities about all aspects of a business doctoral program, and encourage them to follow their dream of becoming a professor; * To provide a nurturing support network for minorities as they navigate their doctoral program; * To increase the number of minority business professors who can function as role models and mentors; * To influence more minorities to pursue business degrees/careers; * To increase the number of qualified minority applicants to fill critical positions in the business disciplines; * To improve the preparation of all students by allowing them to experience the richness of learning from a faculty with diverse backgrounds; and * To reach the goal of a better prepared and more diversified workforce to service a diversified customer base. Approach The PhD Project uses a three-pronged approach to increasing the population of minority business professors: ‚Ä¢ The first component of The PhD Project is a marketing campaign to identify a population of the best and brightest potential PhD candidates of color ‚Äì via an extensive direct mail, print advertising and public relations campaign. Qualified candidates are invited to visit The Project web site and apply to The PhD Project annual conference. ‚Ä¢ The second component of The PhD Project is its annual conference. Qualified candidates are invited to this two-day annual conference where they hear from deans, professors and current minority doctoral students about the benefits of pursuing a business PhD. At this time, candidates are exposed to more than 80 doctoral-granting universities that are represented during a four-hour exhibit show at the conference. Many of these candidates are recruited before they even enter a program. ‚Ä¢ The third component of the program is the Minority Doctoral Student Associations, formed by The PhD Project as a means of combating the high (25 percent) attrition rate inherent among all business doctoral students. Through these professional peer associations (in accounting, finance, information systems, management and marketing) minority doctoral students establish peer support relationships with others who are facing similar challenges on the way to becoming business school professors. Every minority business doctoral student in a full-time, AACSB-accredited program is a member of one of these associations. Each association has an annual conference held in conjunction with the relevant professional academic association. There, the Ph.D. students receive guidance and information concerning every step of the process of earning the doctorate and obtaining employment. The retention rate of doctoral students who are members of these associations exceeds 90 percent. Statistics Recently, The PhD Project surveyed undergraduate and graduate students taking classes from minority professors and/or minority doctoral students to gauge the impact those instructors are having on minority and non-minority students‚Äô education. The survey revealed that minority professors are having an astonishing impact on the career decisions of both minority and non-minority students. When asked, 83% of respondents said minority professors are positively impacting minority students‚Äô employment or internship decisions. Almost 70% of respondents believe that they are impacting non-minority students‚Äô employment or internship decisions, as well.

The Valle d'Aosta DOC (or Vall√©e d'Aoste DOC, in FrenchDue to the official bilingual status of the Aosta Valley.) is an Italian denominazione di origine controllata located in the Aosta Valley of northwest Italy. Surrounded by the Alps, the Valle d'Aosta is home to the highest elevated vineyards in all of Europe. The principal winemaking region of the Valle d'Aosta is found along the eastern banks of the Dora Baltea (fr., Doire balt√©e) river with the city of Aosta serving as the central winemaking location. The region is divided into three main vineyard areas; the upper valley, Valdigne, the central valley (locally Valle centrale in Italian, Vall√©e centrale in French) and the lower valley, (locally Bassa valle in Italian, Basse vall√©e in French). To the south is the winemaking region of Piedmont. The Valle d'Aosta is Italy's smallest winemaking region both in terms of size and production with only about 330,000 cases produced annually in the region and only 36,000 cases produced under the DOC label. Seventy five percent of the area's production is red wine made mostly from the Pinot noir, Gamay and Petit Rouge varieties. A white wine is made from the indigenous Pri√© blanc grape by the cooperative of Blanc de Morgex et de La Salle. M. Ewing-Mulligan & E. McCarthy Italian Wines for Dummies pg 77-82 Hungry Minds 2001 Climate and geography Elevation of the Valle d'Aosta. The lower elevation in the center of the image is the Dora Baltea river leading from Mont Blanc (on the left) down through the valley to Piedmont. The area of the Aosta valley has continental climate and despite its location in the Alps region the weather is typically very hot and dry in the summer time which tends to put harvesttime in early September. The geography of the wine regions is marked by high, steep slopes leading to the river valley which makes the use of mechanical vineyard equipment nearly impossible. The vineyard soils are composed primarily of sand at the higher elevation with more alluvial sediments of clay and gravel further down into the valley. Vineyards The wine-making region of the Valle d'Aosta is generally divided into three areas. In the northwest, the Valdigne area south of the commune of Courmayeur is home to the highest elevated vineyards in Europe at above sea level. The white grape Pri√© Blanc (also known as Blanc de Morgex) accounts for almost all of the vineyard area and is used to produce Blanc de Morgex et de la Salle in both a still and sparkling wine style. Roussin de Morgex, a rare teinturier variety endemic to only a small area around the town of Morgex, has been rescued from extinction to make an unusual pink sparkling wine. Due to its high elevations, the area has never been affected by phylloxera louse, which has allowed the vineyards of this area to remain with ungrafted rootstock. The Central Valley is the region's most productive area and is further sub-divided into four areas-Enfer d'Arvier, Torrette, Nus and Chambave. The Enfer d'Arvier is a red wine-producing area around the village of Arvier. The wines from this area are blends made primarily from the Petit Rouge grape with lesser amounts of Dolcetto, Gamay, Neyret, Pinot noir, and/or Vien de Nus. Previously Enfer d'Arvier had its own DOC designation but was subsequently incorporated into the Valle d'Aosta DOC. T. Stevenson \\"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia\\" pg 274 Dorling Kindersley 2005 The area of the Torrette sub-zone is located east of Arvier and produces a drier wine made with at least 70% Petit Rouge and smaller quantities of Dolcetto, Fumin, Gamay, Neyret, Pinot noir and/or Vien de Nus. The village of Nus, located east of Aosta, produces a wine made with at least 50% Vien de Nus and at least 40% Petit Rouge. White wines are made in this area from a Pinot gris clone known as Malvoisie including a sweet passito straw wine. East of Nus is the sub-zone of Chambave which includes the communities of Chambave, Ch√¢tillon and Saint- Vincent. The red wines made here are composed of at least 60% Petit Rouge with some Dolcetto, Gamay and/or Pinot noir. The white wines made here are from the Moscato Bianco grape. The Lower Valley is known primarily for two styles of wine. The Arnad-Montjovet area produces a medium-bodied dry red wine made from at least 70% Nebbiolo with some Dolcetto, Freisa, Neyret, Pinot noir, and/or Vien de Nus. The area near the commune of Donnaz (or Donnas) produces wine made from at least 85% Nebbiolo with some Freisa, Neyret, Pinot noir and Vien de Nus. Like Enfer d'Arvier, Donnas at one point had its own DOC designation. Here Nebbiolo is paler and less potent due to the high altitude. Other wines Other DOC wines in the Valle d'Aosta can be varietally labeled as long as it contains at least 90% from one of the following grapes-Chardonnay, Fumin, Gamay, M√ºller-Thurgau, Petite Arvine, Pinot gris, Pinot noir, Petit Rouge and Premetta. A generic Valle d'Aosta Bianco/Blanc, Valle d'Aosta Rosso/Rouge and Valle d'Aosta Rosato/Ros√© can be produced from any local grape (such as Bonda and VuillerminJ. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 123-124 & 1154 Allen Lane 2012 ) as long as the wine is made in the appropriate color for the style. The region has no Indicazione Geografica Tipica (IGT) designations so that any wine that doesn't fit into one of the 22 DOC styles is sold under the vini da tavola designation. DOC regulations For the majority of wines, DOC regulations require harvest yields below 12 tonnes per ha with a minimum alcohol levels of at least 9%. Wines typically must age for at least 6 months prior to public release. For some individual wine styles there are notable exceptions and stricter requirements such as the Pinot gris from Nus which is required to have a maximum yield of 8 tonnes/ha and a minimum alcohol content of 16.5% which is very high for a typical white wine. The reserve wines labeled Superiore from the Arnad-Montjovet region must have a minimum alcohol level of 12% and be aged for two years. The Superiore wines from Torrette need a similar 12% alcohol level but only require eight months of aging which is specifically required to be done in oak (wine) casks. The Moscatos from Chambave also require oak aging but only for three months.P.

He was born in Llanegwad, Carmarthenshire, into a relatively prosperous family. He began to preach at an early age, and by 1707 was in charge of the church at Panteg, though he was as yet unordained. He was ordained on 23 September 1711 at the request of his congregation. He was a supporter of Griffith Jones (Llanddowror) in the campaign for circulating schools. He either wrote, co-authored or was involved in the publication of several works published in the Welsh language by a press at Trefhedyn in Cardiganshire. About five years before his death, he went blind.

The caves consist of marine coral limestone, which accumulated over millions of years and after sea levels had dropped were exposed to atmospheric corrosion and karstic processes. They are approximately long and cover an area of .  Location  The site is situated on the island's northern coast, north of the town of Willemstad on the Roosevelt Weg. The caves constitute layers and terraces. Several caves are to be found on the second terrace, the Hato Caves are exclusively located above on the third terrace.  History  The earliest known inhabitants of the caves about 1,500 years ago were the Amerindian Arawaks and Caiquetio Indians, who also buried their dead in the caves. The numerous petroglyphs and cave drawings are attributed to these early occupants. Before the abolition of slavery, runaway slaves used the caves as hiding places.
