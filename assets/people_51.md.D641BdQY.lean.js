A gifted creator of popular portrait paintings, he also produced a vast number of genre paintings vividly documenting French middle-class social life. His life and work spanned the eras of monarchical France, the French Revolution, the Napoleonic Empire, the Bourbon Restoration and the July Monarchy. Life and career Le triomphe de Marat, 1794 The Arrival of a Mail-coach in the Courtyard of the Messageries, 1803, Mus√©e du Louvre The Geography Lesson (Portrait of Monsieur Gaudry and His Daughter), 1812 Boilly was born in La Bass√©e in northern France, the son of a local wood sculptor. A self-taught painter, Boilly began his career at a very young age, producing his first works at the age of twelve or thirteen. In 1774 he began to show his work to the Austin friars of Douai who were evidently impressed: within three years, the bishop of Arras invited the young man to work and study in his bishopric. While there, he produced a cascade of paintings ‚Äì some three hundred small works of portraiture. He received instruction in trompe l'oeil painting from Dominique Doncre (1743‚Äì1820) before moving to Paris around 1787. At the height of the revolutionary Terror in 1794, Boilly was condemned by the Committee of Public Safety for the erotic undertones of his work. This offence was remedied by Boilly's eleventh-hour production of the more patriotic Triumph of Marat (now in the Mus√©e des Beaux Arts, Lille) which saved him from serious penalties. Boilly was a popular and celebrated painter of his time. He was among the first artists to produce lithographs, and became wealthy from the sale of his prints and paintings. He was awarded a medal by the Parisian Salon in 1804 for his work The Arrival of a Mail-coach in the Courtyard of the Messageries. In 1833 he was decorated as a chevalier of the nation's highest order, the L√©gion d'honneur. Boilly died in Paris on 4 January 1845. His youngest son, Alphonse Boilly (1801‚Äì1867), was a professional engraver who apprenticed in New York with Asher Brown Durand. Style and works Entrance to the Jardin Turc, 1812 Incroyable parade, 1797 Fine art Connoisseurs, c. 1823‚Äì1828, lithograph with hand coloring Boilly's early works showed a preference for amorous and moralising subjects. The Suitor's Gift is comparable to much of his work in the 1790s. His small-scale paintings with carefully mannered colouring and precise detailing recalled the work of seventeenth-century Dutch genre painters such as Gabri√´l Metsu (1629‚Äì1667), Willem van Mieris and Gerard ter Borch (1617‚Äì1681), of whose work Boilly owned an important collection. After 1794, Boilly began to produce far more crowded compositions that serve as social chronicles of the urban middle class.Taws, Richard (9 May 2019). \\"At the National Gallery\\". London Review of Books 40 (9): 26‚Äì27. In these works, his observation of contemporary customs is slightly sentimental and often humorous. Boilly was also well respected for his portraiture. By the end of his lifetime he had painted about 5,000 portraits, most of which were painted on canvases measuring 22 cm x 17 cm (8 5/8 in. x 6 5/8 in.). He worked quickly, and boasted of requiring only two hours to complete a portrait. He painted both middle class sitters and prominent contemporaries such as Robespierre.Chaudonneret, M.arie-Claude (2003, January 01). \\"Boilly, Louis-L√©opold\\". Grove Art Online. Boilly's portraits strongly characterize the sitters as individuals, and are usually painted in a sober range of colors. Boilly used his great skill in depicting textures to produce numerous illusionistic works, including paintings in grisaille that mimic prints. In the Salon of 1800 he exhibited a painting that depicted layers of overlapping prints, drawings, and papers, covered by a sheet of broken glass in a wooden frame. His title for the work, \\"Un trompe l'oeil (\\"a trick played on the eye\\"), marked the first use of that term to describe an illusionistic painting. Although art critics derided the painting as a stunt, it caused a popular sensation, and trompe l'oeil entered the language as a name for an entire genre.Whitlum-Cooper, Francesca (2019). Boilly: Scenes of Parisian Life. London: National Gallery Company. p. 25. . His interest in caricature is most apparent in his suite of 98 lithographs titled Recueil de grimaces, published between 1823 and 1828.Whitlum-Cooper, Francesca (2019). Boilly: Scenes of Parisian Life. London: National Gallery Company. p. 30. . Boilly remains a highly regarded master of oil painting. A major exhibition of his work, The Art of Louis-L√©opold Boilly: Modern Life in Napoleonic France, travelled to the United States where it was shown at both the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth and the National Gallery of Art in Washington (1995). The Mus√©e des Beaux Arts in Lille held a large-scale exhibition of Boilly's work during the winter season of 2011‚Äì2012.

In mathematics, hyperbolic coordinates are a method of locating points in quadrant I of the Cartesian plane :\\\\\\\\{(x, y) \\\\ :\\\\ x > 0,\\\\ y > 0\\\\ \\\\\\\\} = Q. Hyperbolic coordinates take values in the hyperbolic plane defined as: :HP = \\\\\\\\{(u, v) : u \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}, v > 0 \\\\\\\\}. These coordinates in HP are useful for studying logarithmic comparisons of direct proportion in Q and measuring deviations from direct proportion. For (x,y) in Q take :u = \\\\ln \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{x}{y}} and :v = \\\\sqrt{xy}. The parameter u is the hyperbolic angle to (x, y) and v is the geometric mean of x and y. The inverse mapping is :x = v e^u ,\\\\quad y = v e^{-u}. The function Q \\\\rarr HP is a continuous mapping, but not an analytic function. Alternative quadrant metric Since HP carries the metric space structure of the Poincar√© half-plane model of hyperbolic geometry, the bijective correspondence Q \\\\leftrightarrow HP brings this structure to Q. It can be grasped using the notion of hyperbolic motions. Since geodesics in HP are semicircles with centers on the boundary, the geodesics in Q are obtained from the correspondence and turn out to be rays from the origin or petal- shaped curves leaving and re-entering the origin. And the hyperbolic motion of HP given by a left-right shift corresponds to a squeeze mapping applied to Q. Since hyperbolas in Q correspond to lines parallel to the boundary of HP, they are horocycles in the metric geometry of Q. If one only considers the Euclidean topology of the plane and the topology inherited by Q, then the lines bounding Q seem close to Q. Insight from the metric space HP shows that the open set Q has only the origin as boundary when viewed through the correspondence. Indeed, consider rays from the origin in Q, and their images, vertical rays from the boundary R of HP. Any point in HP is an infinite distance from the point p at the foot of the perpendicular to R, but a sequence of points on this perpendicular may tend in the direction of p. The corresponding sequence in Q tends along a ray toward the origin. The old Euclidean boundary of Q is no longer relevant. Applications in physical science Fundamental physical variables are sometimes related by equations of the form k = x y. For instance, V = I R (Ohm's law), P = V I (electrical power), P V = k T (ideal gas law), and f Œª = v (relation of wavelength, frequency, and velocity in the wave medium). When the k is constant, the other variables lie on a hyperbola, which is a horocycle in the appropriate Q quadrant. For example, in thermodynamics the isothermal process explicitly follows the hyperbolic path and work can be interpreted as a hyperbolic angle change. Similarly, a given mass M of gas with changing volume will have variable density Œ¥ = M / V, and the ideal gas law may be written P = k T Œ¥ so that an isobaric process traces a hyperbola in the quadrant of absolute temperature and gas density. For hyperbolic coordinates in the theory of relativity see the History section. Statistical applications *Comparative study of population density in the quadrant begins with selecting a reference nation, region, or urban area whose population and area are taken as the point (1,1). *Analysis of the elected representation of regions in a representative democracy begins with selection of a standard for comparison: a particular represented group, whose magnitude and slate magnitude (of representatives) stands at (1,1) in the quadrant. Economic applications There are many natural applications of hyperbolic coordinates in economics: * Analysis of currency exchange rate fluctuation: The unit currency sets x = 1. The price currency corresponds to y. For :0 < y < 1 we find u > 0, a positive hyperbolic angle. For a fluctuation take a new price :0 < z < y. Then the change in u is: :\\\\Delta u = \\\\ln \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{y}{z}} . Quantifying exchange rate fluctuation through hyperbolic angle provides an objective, symmetric, and consistent measure. The quantity \\\\Delta u is the length of the left-right shift in the hyperbolic motion view of the currency fluctuation. * Analysis of inflation or deflation of prices of a basket of consumer goods. * Quantification of change in marketshare in duopoly. * Corporate stock splits versus stock buy-back. History The geometric mean is an ancient concept, but hyperbolic angle was developed in this configuration by Gregoire de Saint-Vincent. He was attempting to perform quadrature with respect to the rectangular hyperbola y = 1/x. That challenge was a standing open problem since Archimedes performed the quadrature of the parabola. The curve passes through (1,1) where it is opposite the origin (mathematics) in a unit square. The other points on the curve can be viewed as rectangles having the same area as this square. Such a rectangle may be obtained by applying a squeeze mapping to the square. Another way to view these mappings is via hyperbolic sectors. Starting from (1,1) the hyperbolic sector of unit area ends at (e, 1/e), where e is 2.71828‚Ä¶, according to the development of Leonhard Euler in Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite (1748). Taking (e, 1/e) as the vertex of rectangle of unit area, and applying again the squeeze that made it from the unit square, yields (e^2, \\\\ e^{-2}). Generally n squeezes yields (e^n, \\\\ e^{-n}). A. A. de Sarasa noted a similar observation of G. de Saint Vincent, that as the abscissas increased in a geometric series, the sum of the areas against the hyperbola increased in arithmetic series, and this property corresponded to the logarithm already in use to reduce multiplications to additions. Euler‚Äôs work made the natural logarithm a standard mathematical tool, and elevated mathematics to the realm of transcendental functions. The hyperbolic coordinates are formed on the original picture of G. de Saint-Vincent, which provided the quadrature of the hyperbola, and transcended the limits of algebraic functions. In special relativity the focus is on the 3-dimensional hypersurface in the future of spacetime where various velocities arrive after a given proper time. Scott WalterWalter (1999) page 6 explains that in November 1907 Hermann Minkowski alluded to a well-known three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry while speaking to the G√∂ttingen Mathematical Society, but not to a four-dimensional one.Walter (1999) page 8 In tribute to Wolfgang Rindler, the author of a standard introductory university-level textbook on relativity, hyperbolic coordinates of spacetime are called Rindler coordinates.

On the same day, the existing television station in North Bay, CKNY, switched affiliation to CTV. Until 1980, CHNB and CKNY aggressively competed with each other for advertising revenues, leaving both in a precarious financial position due to the North Bay market's relatively small size. In 1980, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission approved the merger of the two stations, and with their co-owned stations in Sudbury and Timmins, into the MCTV twinstick. In 1990, the MCTV stations were acquired by Baton Broadcasting, which became the sole corporate owner of CTV in 1997. =End of operations= In 2002, CTV sold its four CBC affiliates in Northern Ontario, CHNB, CJIC in Sault Ste.

The show follows the trio's antics both in live-action and animated segments. The cast consisted of Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Joe DeRita (as Curly-Joe), with actor and close friend Emil Sitka co-starring, as well as Margaret Kerry. The stories took place in varied settings, including a California beach and sailing as buccaneers on the Spanish Main.  Voice cast  * Moe Howard * Larry Fine * Joe DeRita * Emil Sitka * Margaret Kerry * Hal Smith * Johnny Coons Production Forty-one live action sequences were executively produced by cartoonist Norman Maurer, Moe's son-in-law, who was their film agent at this time. Edward Bernds, who had directed the team at Columbia Pictures from 1945 to 1952 during most of the Shemp era, was also hired to write and direct the series. Emil Sitka, who had appeared in many of the Stooges comedies over the years, was slated to appear in these wraparounds as straightman to the Stooges. Cambria Studios produced 156 short Stooge cartoons under the supervision of Lee Orgel. Four cartoons were produced to correspond thematically with 40 of the live-action Stooge opening and closing sequences, so that one live-action sequence could serve as a wraparound for four different cartoons. Joe DeRita later commented that this presented something of a problem for viewers: Most of the cartoons ended up with the trio running into the horizon after accidentally causing havoc at their current jobs. The cartoons were unusual for Cambria in that they did not use Syncro-Vox, Cambria's patented technique which used filmed footage of the voice actors' mouths over top of still frames. The pilot cartoon, \\"That Little Old Bomb Maker\\", featured a unique live-action wrap around that was not reused on other cartoons. Some of the cartoons featured a recurring character named Badman, a jerky supervillain with a Batman get-up who is actually a 5-year-old boy that is nice and kind. The boy can only transform to Badman if he ever hears or says the word \\"bad\\", and for Badman, vice versa for \\"good\\". In the episode \\"Badman of the Briny\\", the two finally find out that they are the same person in several scenes. Another recurring character was a western outlaw named Getoutoftownbysundown Brown. To avoid any potential licensing problems, Cambria did not use any of the past Three Stooges theme songs, including \\"Three Blind Mice\\", or \\"Listen to the Mockingbird\\", even though both had lapsed into the public domain at the time (likewise, the on-screen title used a numeral \\"3\\" to avoid infringing on any trademark Columbia Pictures might have held on the name \\"The Three Stooges\\"). Several of the musical pieces used on the show were also used for the series Bozo's Big Top. The New 3 Stooges was not the first attempt at an animated version of the team. During the late 1950s, Norman Maurer attempted to sell Stooge Time, a live action/rotoscope animation mix half-hour series to television. In 1960, Maurer and the Stooges filmed a pilot for a half-hour series The Three Stooges Scrapbook, which featured a five-minute Stooge cartoon. The Stooges would later return to animated form in two episodes of The New Scooby-Doo Movies and in the series The Robonic Stooges (the latter being produced after the death of both Moe Howard and Larry Fine). Lawsuit The series proved to be a financial headache for the Stooges. In accordance with their contract, Cambria Studios' distributor was supposed to forward quarterly statements to the trio to keep them abreast of the show's profits. Norman Maurer recalled receiving only one or two statements over a five-year period, ultimately leading to a lawsuit. The judge presiding over the case knew little about the film or television industry and ruled in favor of Cambria. The Stooges appealed the decision in 1975, leading to a victory in their favor. However, it changed nothing in regard to the distributor's failure to provide the necessary profit statements to Normandy Productions, and by the time the case was decided, both Larry and Moe had died.

Using the original 16mm acetates, Rhino Entertainment issued a restored version in 2002 of 28 live action segments, and 32 of the cartoons over two volumes. Each volume contains a Spanish audio option, and Volume one has a near 7 minute retrospective interview with Lee Orgel. During it, he mentions only 39 live action segments being produced which adds confusion to some claims of there being 40 or 41. Of the many DVD releases of the show, these Rhino Volumes have many reviews stating they are of the best quality available of the series. The Three Stooges ‚Äì Cartoon Classics, Vol. 1 In 2004, EastWest DVD released a slim case volume of episodes. In 2007 and 2008, Mill Creek Entertainment released a number of episodes as part of their Ultimate 150 Cartoon Festival, their Giant 600 Cartoon Collection and their 200 Classic Cartoons ‚Äì Collector's Edition Label formats. On October 15, 2013, Image Madacy Entertainment released The New 3 Stooges: Complete Cartoon Collection on DVD in Region 1 making it the first time for a complete set to be released.[7] The five-disc set features all 156 cartoons and 39 live action sequences on four discs, with the bonus disc being an audio CD by the Stooges which combines tracks from two of their albums (one of them being their 1959, The Nonsense Songbook). Reception The New 3 Stooges was well received upon initial airings, despite the use of limited animation. However, the Stooges were visibly aging during this time (Moe was 68 and Larry was 63), so the team's patented slapstick routines were subdued in the live action segments. Orgel later stated that the Stooges' penchant for violence was kept to a minimum due to the concerns of parental groups. In addition, Larry's motor skills had become somewhat sluggish, resulting in occasional slurred dialogue. To compensate, most of the comedy being divided between Moe and Curly-Joe, with Larry only chiming in when necessary. In retrospect, this altered comedy dynamic was a throwback to the Stooges' prime years in the 1930s when Curly Howard dominated the team's films and Larry was relegated to an occasional line of dialogue. The New 3 Stooges lasted for a single season. Although animated portions of the show were last aired in syndication on WGN-TV in the Chicago area in the early 1980s and 1990s, repackaged, redubbed and distributed at the time by DIC Animation City and Jeffrey Scott Productions,New 3 Stooges ‚Äì Syndicated Program Elements, Circa 1992 ‚Äì YouTube, accessed on January 26, 2013. it is occasionally seen on Me-TV. It also aired in Japan on TV Tokyo. The New 3 Stooges became the only regularly scheduled television series in the Stooges' history. Unlike other film shorts that aired on television like Looney Tunes, Tom and Jerry and Popeye the Sailor, the Stooges' short films never had a regularly scheduled national television program to air in, neither on network nor syndicated; the film shorts, at roughly 20 minutes apiece, were of ideal size to be run as a stand-alone television series in and of themselves. When Columbia/Screen Gems licensed the film library to television beginning in 1958, local stations aired the shorts when they saw fit, either as late-night \\"filler\\" or marathon sessions.

In soil science, agriculture and gardening, hardpan or soil pan is a dense layer of soil, usually found below the uppermost topsoil layer. There are different types of hardpan, all sharing the general characteristic of being a distinct soil layer that is largely impervious to water. Some hardpans are formed by deposits in the soil that fuse and bind the soil particles. These deposits can range from dissolved silica to matrices formed from iron oxides and calcium carbonate. Others are man-made, such as hardpan formed by compaction from repeated plowing, particularly with moldboard plows, or by heavy traffic or pollution. Formations Soil structure strongly affects its tendency to form a hard pan. One such common soil condition related to hardpan is soil pH. Acid soils are most often affected due to the propensity of certain mineral salts, most notably iron and calcium, to form hard complexes with soil particles under acid conditions. Another major determinant is the soil particle size. Clay particles are some of the smallest particles commonly found in soils. Due to their structure the spaces between individual clay particles is small and already restricts the passage of water, reducing infiltrationC.Michael Hogan. 2010. Abiotic factor. Encyclopedia of Earth. eds Emily Monosson and C. Cleveland. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC and hence drainage. Soils with a high clay content are also easily compacted and affected by man-made discharges. Clay particles have a strong negative electrostatic charge and will readily bond to positively charged ions dissolved in the soil-water matrix. Common salts such as sodium ions contained in wastewater can fulfil this role and lead to a localized hardpan in some soil types. This is a common cause of septic system failure due to the prevention of proper drainage in field. Problems and workarounds Hardpan can be a problem in farming and gardening by impeding drainage of water and restricting the growth of plant roots. In these situations, the hardpan can be broken up by either mechanical means such as digging or plowing, or through the use of soil amendments. The broadfork is a manual tool specifically designed for this task; a digging fork or a spade might also be used. The chisel plow does a similar job with the help of a tractor. The use of soil amendments can also be employed to alter the soil structure and promote the dissolution of the hard pan. It has been observed that increasing the amount of soil organic matter through the working-in of manure, compost or peat can both improve local drainage and promote the proliferation of earth worms that can, over time, break relatively thin hardpan layers. More difficult hardpans may be further improved through the action of both adjusting the soil pH with lime if the soil is acidic, and with the addition of gypsum. This combination can help loosen clay particles bound into a hardpan by the actions of hard salts such as iron, calcium carbonate and sodium, by promoting their mobility through a higher pH while proving a suitable source of exchanging minerals (the gypsum). This works because gypsum salts, although not \\"soft\\", are still water permeable and have a larger, more open structure, the results of which do not promote as hard a matrix as was replaced. However, unlike when employing mechanical means, breaking a hardpan through the use of amendments may require action over the course of years, and even then one is by no means assured success. The results are primarily determined by how extensive and / or intractable the hardpan is.

It serves the Nigerian market and exports to other parts of West Africa. History Nigerian Breweries was incorporated in 1946 and the first bottle of its brand, the STAR Lager, rolled off the bottling lines of its Lagos brewery in June 1949. As the company expanded into other regions, it established more breweries such as Aba Brewery in 1957 and Kaduna Brewery in 1963. By 1971, the company was one of the largest industries within the country in terms of capital investment. In 1982, another brewery was added in Ibadan. In September 1993, the company acquired its fifth brewery in Enugu, and in October 2003, its sixth brewery, sited at Ameke in Enugu. Ama Brewery began brewing on the 22 March 2003 and at 3 million hectolitres is the largest brewery in Nigeria. = Early years = The idea to establish a brewery in Lagos was first promoted by Frank Samuel of UAC prior to World War II. But it was not until the war ended that concrete steps were taken to kick start such a project. Market leaders in the sector were all imported brands with the absence of a locally produced beer. UAC did not have a technical history in beer making leading the firm to enter into a technical agreement with Heineken, the brewery project also brought in investments from other merchandise companies in Nigeria including John Holt, GBO, SCOA, CFAO and UTC who all took some equity interest in the new company. Construction of the brewery began at Iganmu, Lagos in 1947 and was completed in 1949. After completion, a major hurdle of NBL was how the new brand can gain acceptability among beer drinkers in the country and how to make it the brand the preferred beer of choice. Another vexing issue, was how to transport the product to consumers around the country. To gain acceptability, NBL utilized consumer market research to understand the demands of the market and developed a marketing strategy around STAR Lager that used advertisements to show a link between drinking beer and modernity. One of the advertising themes was to depict STAR beer as a quality product produced locally, engaging consumers to buy made in Nigeria beer. It engaged the services of sister outfit, Lintas to produce its advertisements and was one of the early companies to use sophisticated market research skills and to heavily advertise a Nigerian brand using both outdoor, print and television outlets. Between 1950 and 1960, beer consumption increased in Nigeria and NBL increased its market share. Star attained market leadership in 1960 which created a need to build more factories in Nigeria. To get products to consumers, the company gave rights to sell its brand to select distributors and built depots at strategic locations within the country. In the 1970s, it created a motorised and national sales team. In addition, NBL introduced assorted non-alcoholic mineral and flavored drinks under Rainbow brand that included, Krola, Tip Top Tonic Water and Sundowner soda water. It also introduced Gulder into the market and acquired rights to market Schweppes bitter lemon in the country. In 1972, it sold its non-alcoholic drink franchise. = 1980s and 1990s = In the 1980s, NBL gradually increased its market share of the alcoholic beverage market at the expense of smaller breweries. In 1988, NBL facilities had to undergo a conversion process when the government banned importation of imported barley. The firm employed Heineken's technical assistance with the conversion process and also established a grain farm in Niger State to supply locally produced grains for the breweries.  21st century  In 2010, NBL acquired beer factories from Sona Group makers of maltonic malt drink and franchise owners of Goldberg beer. The factories included Sona Breweries at Ota and Kaduna and Life Breweries at Onitsha. In 2014, the firm merged with Consolidated Breweries, producers of 33 export and Williams Dark Ale.

For hay, the windrow is often formed by a hay rake, which rakes hay that has been cut by a mowing machine or by scythe into a row, or it may naturally form as the hay is mown. For small grain crops which are to be harvested, the windrow is formed by a swather which both cuts the crop and forms the windrow.

Players compete as the corrupt power elite families of a fictional parody of a stereotypical banana republic (specifically Republica de los Bananas) trying to get as much money as possible into their Swiss bank accounts before the foreign aid money runs out. Fighting in the republic's capital during recurrent coup attempts encompasses most of the game's equipment, rules and playtime. This game-within-the-game is however actually tangential to the players' main goal. The length of the game depends on how often coups are declared, but can often exceed six hours. The game's title is taken from the Spanish term \\"Junta\\" that originally referred to the executive bodies that frequently came to power after a military coup in 20th century Latin America (the Spanish version is called Golpe, which means coup d'√©tat). In the game, the term refers to the players who declare \\"Rebel\\" at the beginning of the coup phase, and‚Äîif the coup is victorious‚Äîto the players who declare \\"pro- Junta\\" at the end of the coup phase to elect a new president. Players The players of Junta represent corrupt and powerful Banana Republic families. Although players are often executed or assassinated in the course of gameplay, the only real implication of a player's death is the loss of cash and Junta cards he is carrying and a temporary inability to participate until his next turn, when another member of the family steps up to assume the responsibilities of the deceased. Each player is given a family token to underscore this permanent identity, although the token has no effect on game play. Cabinet positions, however, which are denoted by cards, are reassigned each turn. Game play Each game turn represents a year, which takes place during seven stages represented on the board's \\"political track\\". The game ends when the President cannot draw eight bills from the foreign aid money at the beginning of a turn. This event is disguised by the blank bills placed at the bottom of the foreign aid deck and by the \\"used\\" bills which are placed under the blanks when spent as part of a card action. A typical game will have 9-11 rounds. The winner is the player who has the most money in his or her Swiss bank account at the end of the game. Money on one's person is irrelevant. Each player not in exile has the ability to draw and play \\"Junta\\" cards, direct the votes he controls via cabinet positions, influence, and vote cards on the President and the budget votes, carry out the abilities listed on his influence cards and cabinet positions, command his troops during a coup, and manage his money. In all votes, each player commands one vote representing himself and whatever votes he can garner from influence or voting cards. The only exception is the Presidential election after a successful coup in which each rebel player commands one and only one vote. =Upkeep phase= Junta cards are drawn and El Presidente is elected, if necessary. Each player's vote in the Chamber of Deputies as well as influence and vote cards are used. An errata later clarified that if a player declines a nomination votes may be recast with the exception of vote cards which are discarded. El Presidente retains his or her position until the event of assassination, a successful coup, or resignation. All three events have the effect of liquidating the President's assets and delivering his cash to his assassin or successor. =Cabinet phase= El Presidente assigns cabinet positions to the other players. El Presidente cannot hold a cabinet position and must assign each other player at least one position. If fewer than seven players are playing, or if players are in exile, players may hold two positions, but no more than one Generalship. Each cabinet position (note: not each player) holds one vote in the Chamber of Deputies. Cabinet positions are as follows: ; Minister of Internal Security : The commander of the secret police, who may deliver a \\"free\\" assassination each turn. The Minister also may force a budget to pass if it fails and has the option of assassinating any player returning from \\"exile.\\" ; Generals of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd armies : Generals control their respective armies in the event of a coup. ; Chief of the Air Force : Controls airstrikes and paratroopers in the event of a coup. ; Admiral of the Navy : Controls naval bombardment and marines in the event of a coup. The rulebook makes reference to the \\"ceremonial shelling of the Presidential Palace\\" at the beginning of a coup. =Budget phase= El Presidente draws 8 bills from the foreign aid money deck. Bills come in denominations of 1, 2, or 3 million pesos in order of decreasing probability. Thus, the President may draw between 8 and 24 million pesos on a given turn. El Presidente then assigns the budget by declaring how much money he intends to give to each player. Only the President knows the amount drawn, but he must reveal how much he intends to give to each other player. The budget is then voted on. If the budget fails the President keeps all the money, unless the Minister forces the budget to pass. Forcing the budget to pass has the effect of distributing the foreign aid money as if the budget had passed, consolidating the police units in the Chamber of Deputies, and making a coup justified that turn. =Assassination phase= A round of assassinations takes place. First each player chooses his location using the location tiles in a secret yet binding fashion. Locations are as follows: *Home (causes the player to be killed if a \\"burglars\\" assassination card is played against him) *Mistress (leaves a player vulnerable to a \\"character assassination\\" card) *Nightclub *Headquarters (allows the player to start a coup without an excuse) *Bank (allows the player to access his Swiss bank account, should he survive to the banking phase) Then each player declares his assassinations. The Minister of Internal Security gets to use the secret police for one assassination and any player may order one with an assassination card. To declare an assassination, a player must name the player he or she is trying to assassinate and the location at which the assassination will be attempted. Once all assassinations are declared, they are resolved in order. An assassination is successful if a player's location is guessed correctly, although some assassination cards require a successful dice roll as well and some cards may be used to thwart an assassination. If multiple assassination attempts are declared against a single player, they are resolved in the order they were declared (a player cannot be killed more than once). An assassinated player discards his hand, turns over his cash to the assassinator, and is inactive for the rest of the turn. Assassinations are transitive (if A assassinates B and B assassinates C, A gets both B and C's money). If players kill each other (e.g. assassinates B and B assassinates A) both players' money is discarded to the bottom of the foreign aid deck (under the blanks). The same holds true for larger mutual assassinations (A assassinates B, B assassinates C, C assassinates A). If all players die during the assassination phase, the rules specify that all players lose the game. Assassination attempts by the Minister's secret police may not take place at the Bank two turns in a row. After an assassination attempt has taken place at the Bank, an indicator on the board is changed to indicate that the \\"Bank is Safe\\" from the secret police for a turn. The \\"Bank is Safe\\" indicator does not affect assassin cards. If the President has been assassinated, a new President is elected immediately after the last assassination has been resolved. Assassinated players may not take any action until the beginning of the next turn. =Banking phase= A player who chose the Bank as his location and who escaped assassination may deposit or withdraw money from his Swiss bank account. That is unless the budget failed. If the budget failed but was forced through by the Minister of Internal Security, the bank is closed for lunch until after the coup phase. If the budget failed altogether, leaving the President with the entire foreign aid, no banking may take place at all this turn. =Coup phase= The majority of the Junta board is used only during a coup. Coups are a tactical game within the game that may result in the replacement of the President and unfortunate players being sent to the firing squad. Which side a player supports is often unclear during a coup. A scheming player can benefit by concealing their true objectives to gain a favourable position to negotiate from. Others may find it easier simply being a turncoat. Starting a coup In order to start a coup there must exist a coup excuse, which is kept track of by an indicator on the board. Coup excuses are as follows: *The budget failed. *The Minister of Internal Security seized the Chamber of Deputies. *Any player was assassinated. *Any player plays a card providing a coup excuse. Also, any player who chose his \\"Headquarters\\" as his location in the Location phase may start a coup without an excuse to do so. If allowed, any player may start a coup, thus becoming First Rebel, by playing a card to place units on the board, moving any unit or bombarding the presidential palace. If no player does this, no coup takes place. The risk a player takes on in declaring himself the First Rebel is that he will also end up being the only rebel, and suffer reprisals in the wake of an unsuccessful coup. Rebel phase The first phase of a coup is called the rebel phase. After the First Rebel has initiated the coup, all players in turn are given a chance to act. Any player who chooses to move or fire during the rebel phase becomes a rebel. Players who refrain from acting in the rebel phase remain loyalists. Coup phases Following the rebel phase comes six coup phases. The players battle for control of five buildings, shown in red on the map, vital for the post-coup resolution. They are: *The Presidential Palace *The Radio Station (WZAP) *The Chamber of Deputies *The Treasury *The Railway Station Although there officially are the two sides of rebels and loyalists, in-faction fighting may take place as players change sides or seize opportunities of gaining a stronger position. Should a loyalist attack a Palace Guard unit, he becomes a rebel. A rebel, however, cannot become a loyalist. The combat rules are fairly complex. Units first move, and then volleys can be fired between opposing units that are in the same area. The side that loses the most units from combat must retreat to an unoccupied adjacent area. Coup victory After the end of the final coup phase, the players negotiate and must declare themselves either Pro-President or Pro- Junta. A rebel may choose to be Pro-President, and a loyalist may see reasons to become Pro-Junta. The side controlling three or more of the vital buildings is victorious. If the President prevails, he may have any one rebel sent to the firing squad. In the case of a Junta victory, the rebels elect a new President. A Pro-Junta loyalist takes no part in the election. The First Rebel breaks a tied vote. The new President may then send any player, rebels as well as loyalists, to be executed. An executed player discards his political cards and hands over his pocket money to the President. =Exile= A player may go into exile during the Location phase by placing a location marker on one of the embassies on the map, to indicate the country fled to. It is also possible to flee the republic during a coup, provided that the player controls an embassy with their forces. A player in exile is safe from executions and assassinations, but is very limited in all but the social aspects of the game. A player may return from exile at any time, but normally the Minister of Internal Security may have the returning player executed by the secret police at will. It is only safe to return from exile when the President is dead, before a new one has been elected, during a coup provided that a friendly player controls the relevant embassy, or if the Minister's position is frozen (see below). =Brother-in-law= A dead or exiled player may not use any of his family's cabinet positions. The President may control one such position through his brother-in-law. Any other positions of dead or exiled players are considered frozen. Reception Aaron Allston reviewed Junta in The Space Gamer No. 33. Allston commented that \\"Overall, Junta is highly recommended to all gamers who enjoy backstabbing.\\" In the December 1993 edition of Dragon (Issue 200), Allen Varney gave Junta a thumbs up: \\"Do you like casual corruption, hilarious doubletalk, and soldiers who can‚Äôt shoot straight? We got them all. Muy bien, I think!\\" Junta was chosen for inclusion in the 2007 book Hobby Games: The 100 Best. Darren Watts commented, \\"Junta isn't one of the 100 greatest hobby games because of its rules and mechanics ‚Äî they're good, each of them, but not brilliant. It's a great hobby game because it creates a mood and captures a theme brilliantly, and integrates every single design element to that cause. With its wonderful sense of comical menace, political instability, and institutionalized corruption, Junta is a hoot and a half to play.\\" References *Emrich, Alan. (1986).

Broadforks are used as part of a no-till or reduced-till seedbed preparation process because they preserve the soil structure and avoid the resurfacing of weed seeds. It consists of five or so metal tines, approximately eight inches long, spaced a few inches apart on a horizontal bar, with two handles extending upwards to chest or shoulder level, forming a large U-shape. The operator steps up on the crossbar, using full bodyweight to drive the tines into the ground, then steps backward while pulling backwards on the handles, causing the tines to lever upwards through the soil. This action leaves the soil layers intact, rather than inverting or mixing them, preserving the topsoil structure. A broadfork can be used in a garden, or practically for one to two acres (4,000 to 8,000 m¬≤). For larger areas, a tractor- or animal- powered chisel plow or similar tool is usually employed. U-bar A u-bar is similar to a broadfork, but has longer tines at 18 inches (or 457 mm) for deeper cultivation, since it is meant to be used in beds that have already been double dug at least once.http://www.leevalley.com/us/garden/page.aspx?p=10521&cat;=2,42578,40769 A u-bar also has \\"elbows\\" that allow the tines to be raised above soil level when the handles are tilted all the way back. Thus, clumps of soil that get caught on the tines can be broken up by shaking the handles up and down, rocking the tool on its elbows. Whereas double digging a one hundred square foot (9.3 square meter) bed can take several hours, tilling the same bed with a u-bar can be done in 20 minutes.

In 1999 they published their first LP as a group, Genios, which increased their popularity on the Spanish rap scene. They had legal problems with a whiskey company called Doble V, so they changed the name of the group back to their original name Violadores del Verso. In 2001 they published two more albums as Doble V. In 2006 they published \\"Vivir para contarlo\\", which is regarded as one of the best Spanish hip hop albums of all time.

Relational Aesthetics in particular has come to be seen as a defining text for a wide variety of art produced by a generation who came to prominence in Europe in the early 1990s. Bourriaud coined the term in 1995, in a text for the catalogue of the exhibition Traffic that was shown at the CAPC contemporary art museum in Bordeaux. In Postproduction (2001), Bourriaud relates deejaying to contemporary art. Radicant (2009) aims to define the emergence of the first global modernity, based on translation and nomadic forms, against the postmodern aesthetics based on identities. In The Exform (2016), Bourriaud examines the dynamics of ideology, specifically as it was developed in the work of Louis Althusser, to account for distinctions between the productive and unproductive, product and waste, and the included and excluded in their relation to society and art production.

It is a subsidiary of Heineken International. The company operates brewing plants in Monterrey, Guadalajara, Toluca, Tecate, Orizaba and, beginning in 2017, Meoqui. The plants produce, among other brands, Dos Equis, Sol, Bohemia, Superior, Carta Blanca, Noche Buena, Indio, Casta and Tecate. It has an annual production of 3.09 GL (gigalitres). History The Moctezuma Brewery, near Orizaba. C. B. Waite, photographer The Cuauht√©moc brewery was founded in Monterrey in 1890 by Jos√© A. Muguerza, Francisco G. Sada Muguerza, Alberto Sada Muguerza, Isaac Garza Garza (brother in-law of Francisco and Alberto, married to their sister Consuelo Sada Muguerza), and Joseph M. Schnaider, with capital of 150,000 pesos, starting with the Carta Blanca brand. The Cuauht√©moc brewery produced its first beer barrel in 1893 and won first prize in the Chicago and Paris world fairs. The Cervecer√≠a Moctezuma was founded near Orizaba during the late Porfiriato by German brewer Wilhelm Hasse. In 1909 Cervecer√≠a Cuauht√©moc started to expand vertically. To provide glass bottles, in 1909, Vidrios y Cristales de Monterrey, S.A., later Vidriera Monterrey, S.A. later Grupo Vitro, was founded. In order to produce boxes, bottle caps, and packaging materials, F√°bricas de Cart√≥n Monterrey was founded in 1900. In 1929, Malta, S.A. was established to produce malt for the brewery. The cardboard box department would eventually become Tit√°n Company. During the Mexican Revolution which began in 1910, its original founders supported Victoriano Huerta. As a consequence, his rival Venustiano Carranza seized the brewery, so the founders' families fled to Texas. They re-acquired the brewery through the intervention of U.S. and Russian diplomats. The Sociedad Cuauht√©moc was founded in 1918 to provide medical and educative services to the workers' families; the final objective was to provide a welfare system to avoid strikes. The working day was reduced from twelve to nine hours in 1907. By 1936 the holdings of the Garza, Calder√≥n and Sada families and their associates were divided into two groups: the Cuauhtemoc (brewery) group and the Vidriera (glass) group. In that year the family's holdings were reorganized, creating Valores Industriales S.A. (VISA) as a holding company controlling the majority of shares of the firms formerly held by Cuauhtemoc, especially Cerveceria Cuauhtemoc and Famosa. During the 20th century, Cervecer√≠a Cuauht√©moc Moctezuma was headed by Jos√© Calder√≥n Muguerza and the two Garza Sada brothers Eugenio Garza Sada (assassinated in 1973 in a kidnapping attempt by Mexican left-wing guerrillas) and Roberto Garza Sada. In 1943, company executive Eugenio Garza Sada with his brother and other prominent people founded the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education (ITESM), and in 1973, the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame was opened at the site of the company headquarters. After Eugenio Garza Sada's assassination, VISA, the Cerveceria Cuauthtemoc Moctezuma's holding, was split into two units: Visa and Grupo Industrial Alfa. Alfa received Hylsa and cash, while Visa retained the brewery business and its stake in the Banco de Londres and its affiliated institutions, and Eugenio Garza Lag√ºera, a son of Eugenio Garza Sada, was named CEO of Cerveceria Cuauhtemoc Moctezuma, and Bernardo Garza Sada a son of Roberto Garza Sada was named CEO of Alfa. When oil prices fell in 1981, Mexico's economic boom, financed with borrowed money, abruptly halted. Visa found itself more than $1 billion in debt the following year, and the federal government nationalized Banca Serfin‚Äîthe nation's third-largest bank‚Äîin which Visa held a 77 percent stake. The nondeposit banks and associated financial companies in Grupo Financiero Serfin, not nationalized, were reorganized into a new financial-services group called Valores de Monterrey (Vamsa). Vamsa's life-insurance subsidiary, Seguros Monterrey, was the largest in Mexico. With the integration of the Moctezuma brewery in 1985, the Dos Equis, Superior, Sol, and Noche Buena brands were added to the Carta Blanca, Tecate, Bohemia and Indio brands. In 1988 Fomento Econ√≥mico Mexicano, S.A. de C.V. was formed as the main subsidiary of Visa containing the beer and other companies. In 1994 FEMSA sold a 22 percent share of its beer business to John Labatt Ltd. of Canada and signed an agreement with Labatt to associate their respective companies in the United States. FEMSA became the successor of Visa in 1998. On 11 January 2010, the Dutch brewing company Heineken International announced it would acquire the beer activities of FEMSA, including Cuauht√©moc Moctezuma Brewery. In 2017 Heineken Mexico (Cuauhtemoc Moctezuma) and Molson Coors sign a deal to import Cerveza Sol to areas in the US that Heineken doesn't import Sol to this deal also allowed Heineken Mexico (Cuauhtemoc Moctezuma) to import Molson Coors Miller and Coors brands to Mexico. Breweries Cuauht√©moc Moctezuma The company operates plants in Monterrey, Tecate, Navojoa, Guadalajara, Toluca, Orizaba and for 2012 one in Chihuahua. The company has an annual production of . Beers The company produces a range of pale and dark lagers, some of which are available only in Mexico. =Carta Blanca= The brewery's original premium beer. Carta Blanca takes its name from the French \\"carte blanche\\". =Sol= Loading a truck of Sol Beer in Campeche Introduced in the 1890s, originally called El Sol. Sol is for sale in four sizes in Mexico: , -not refundable aluminium can, bottles and , this last is known as a Caguama (English: Sea turtle). New variations from Cerveza Sol include: Sol Brava (a dark beer in a light dark bottle), Sol Light, Sol Sal y Lim√≥n (Sol with lime and salt) Sol Clamato (Beer mixed with Clamato) and Sol Cero (non-alcohol beer). =Indio= Indio beer has six sizes: Aluminium can , -not refundable and bottles plus a refundable and not- refundable bottle, a refundable bottle and a refundable bottle. =Bohemia= Bohemia 5.3% alc. takes its name from the Czech region. It is pale pilsner, although recently a new dark Vienna beer has been launched as Bohemia Obscura (See Image Gallery below). In addition, Cuauht√©moc Moctezuma has added a craft-style wheat beer to the line ‚Äì \\"Bohemia Weizen\\" a German Kristallweizen was released in summer 2011. =Dos Equis= Dos Equis () is a lager that was originally brewed by a German-born Mexican brewer. The brand was named Siglo XX (\\"20th century\\") to commemorate the arrival of the new century, and the bottles were marked with the Roman numeral for 20 (\\"XX\\"), thus \\"Dos Equis\\" which is Spanish for \\"two Xs\\". The main brand Dos Equis XX Special Lager is a 4.45% abv pale lager sold in green bottles. Dos Equis XX Amber is a 4.7% Vienna-style amber lager sold in brown bottles, and was first exported to the United States in 1973. Dos Equis XX Mexican Pale Ale is a 5.5% traditional pale ale with a Mexican twist, released in late 2018 on draught to various restaurants and bars across the United States. As of February 2019 it could be purchased as a six pack of bottles or a twelve pack of cans. =Tecate= Cuauht√©moc Moctezuma Tecate and Tecate Light are popular pale lagers named after the city of Tecate, Baja California, where they were first produced in 1943. Originally brewed by a local company, Tecate was acquired by Cuauht√©moc Moctezuma in 1955. Tecate is sold in both distinctive red and blue aluminium cans and in twist-top bottles. Tecate Light was launched in 1992 by H√©ctor Emilio Ayala, who was the project manager. In 2013 Tecate Titanium, containing a greater amount of alcohol was launched as a new product of the company. In 2017, Heineken announced that Tecate would be exported worldwide.Tecate, Heineken‚Äôs Second Mexican Brand, Goes Global - 27 April 2017 =Other beers= *Heineken *Amstel *Affligem *Kloster *Canijilla *Lagunitas *Strongbow *Ladron de Manzanas *Miller *Coors *Moctezuma *Noche Buena Its name comes from the Spanish name of the poinsettia flower, commonly attached to the Christmas festivities.

Its marketing slogan was \\"La Rubia que todos quieren\\" (\\"The Blonde that everyone loves\\"). Advertising =Dos Equis= In 2007, Dos Equis inaugurated its \\"The Most Interesting Man in the World\\" advertising campaign. The advertisements feature a bearded, debonair older gentleman (portrayed by actor Jonathan Goldsmith) with Frontline narrator Will Lyman conducting voiceovers. As Ottmar Liebert's \\"Barcelona Nights\\" plays in the background, the advertisements featured a montage of daring exploits involving \\"the most interesting man\\" when he was younger. The precise settings are never revealed, but he performs feats such as: freeing an angry bear from a painful-looking bear trap; shooting a pool trick shot before an audience; catching a marlin while cavorting in a Hemingway-esque scene with a young woman; winning an arm-wrestling match in a South American setting; surfing the killer wave; and bench pressing two young women in a casino setting, each woman being seated in a chair. In the commercial he says, \\"I don't always drink beer, but when I do, I prefer Dos Equis.\\" Each commercial ends with the sign-off: \\"Stay thirsty, my friends.\\" After nearly a decade of being the mascot for the beer, the character was sent on a one-way trip to Mars in a commercial. From September 2016, \\"The Most Interesting Man in the World\\" is a French actor named Augustin Legrand. The campaign was ended in 2018, and replaced with a new campaign called \\"Keep It Interesante\\". =Tecate= Tecate beer has begun advertising heavily in the United States; initially in the Spanish-language media and more recently in the English-language media. Their tag lines are \\"Con Car√°cter\\" (\\"With Character\\") and \\"It's not beer, it's cerveza\\". Tecate was the primary sponsor of Mexican race driver Adri√°n Fern√°ndez during his career in CART in the 1990s and early 2000s. In the mid 2000s, Tecate became a major sponsor in boxing. It partnered with Golden Boy Promotions in 2006, then switched to Top Rank, then returned to Golden Boy in 2016, sponsoring TV Azteca and Solo boxeo shows, and signing world champions Manny Pacquiao and Canelo √Ålvarez. In 2009, Tecate Light launched a television ad campaign targeted at the Mexican-American community, which features boxer Oscar de La Hoya and wrestler Rey Mysterio, Jr. Also in 2009, Tecate announced a sponsorship agreement with ESPN sports. In the 2007 movie Hellboy II: The Golden Army, Hellboy is shown drinking Tecate Light with Abraham Sapien and in a locker room with Krauss. In the 2014 movie That Awkward Moment, with actors Zac Efron and Miles Teller, Efron's character is shown drinking Tecate with his friends in their New York apartment. In 2015 a series of ads were recorded with the action actor Sylvester Stallone in his role of Rocky Balboa, in this campaign Rocky appears saying the phrase \\"Te hace falta ver m√°s box\\" (In English You need to watch more boxing) in which he gives a cold stare to some men that are not acting so \\"manly\\" (e.g. listening to pop music or putting on too many clothes for cold weather). In the end Stallone says that \\"Somos box\\" (\\"We are box\\") while retired boxers are shown and \\"Eye of the tiger\\" from Survivor) is played. In Mexico the word is changed to Bax, as Stallone uses the English pronunciation for the sport. At the end of the commercial, Rocky looks moved by the progress of the people he helped only to receive a cold stare from Stallone himself. Stallone later led another Mexican ad campaign with soccer players and even his rival from Rocky IV, Dolph Lundgren, to help some Mexican fans to support the National Team in the World Cup 2018. Tecate signed Mexican boxer Canelo √Ålvarez in 2016. During the 2016 presidential election campaign, Tecate ran a television ad mocking Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. The \\"Tecate Beer Wall\\" is \\"a wall that brings us together, and it's going to be huge. You're welcome, America\\". Football teams sponsored =Liga MX= *C.F.

Hoel (7 March 1824 ‚Äì 23 May 1879) was an officer in the United States Navy during the American Civil War.Credible sources list William R. Hoel's middle name as \\"Ryan\\" and \\"Rion\\". However, credible sources list his son's name as \\"Rion Hoel\\". A native of Butler County, Ohio, Hoel was a Mississippi River steamboat pilot when he entered the United States Navy 19 October 1861. Family life Hoel's first wife was Mary Riley, daughter of Daniel Riley, of Cincinnati. His second wife was Elizabeth Hunt, eldest daughter of Dr. Samuel Pancoast Hunt and his wife Elizabeth Thomas, of Morrow, Warren County, Ohio. Captain Hoel and Elizabeth Hoel had two children: Sarah Elizabeth Hoel and Rion Hoel.Morrow, Josiah (1882). The history of Warren County, Ohio. Chicago: W. H. Beers. pp. 854‚Äì58 Opening the Mississippi On 6 February 1862, while serving as the First Master of , Hoel was wounded during the Battle of Fort Henry. Less than two months later, on 4 April, he volunteered to pilot gunboat Carondelet in her famous run past the Rebel batteries at Island Number 10 to reach Maj. Gen. John Pope's Army at New Madrid. The gunboat's valiant dash through a hailstorm of Confederate fire enabled Union forces to cross the river and to take this key island with quantities of cannon, equipment and stores. It thus opened the Mississippi for operations by Union gunboats bringing the Federal armies in a long stride to within sight of Memphis. Hoel's courageous and skillful service on this occasion won the praise of Flag-Officer Andrew H. Foote, the thanks of the Navy from Secretary Gideon Welles, and promotion to the rank of Acting Volunteer Lieutenant effective 29 April 1862. On 10 May 1862 Hoel assumed command of Cincinnati when serious wounds incapacitated her captain, Commander Roger N. Stembel. The new commander of the Western Flotilla, Captain Charles Henry Davis, took this opportunity to express his admiration of Hoel. \\"I can not praise more than they deserve his high valor and ability. He sets the highest example to those below him, and if it were possible to give him a permanent position worthy of his merits, the Navy would be the gainer ...\\" The Vicksburg campaign On 29 October, Hoel then took command of USS Pittsburg on which he served with distinction in the campaign to take Vicksburg. One of Lieutenant Hoel's exploits during this campaign is of special interest since it foreshadowed the heroism of the World War II destroyer which bore his name, USS Hoel. On 29 April 1863, as Acting Rear Admiral David D. Porter's flotilla was bombarding the Confederate Batteries at Grand Gulf, his flagship, USS Benton, became unmanageable and was caught under heavy fire in a position where she could neither steer nor reply to the enemy guns. On seeing Porter's predicament, Hoel slipped the Pittsburg in between Benton and the flaming Rebel batteries to protect her by taking the fire himself. In the next 10 minutes his heroism cost the Pittsburg 6 men killed and 8 wounded, but the sacrifice allowed Benton to extricate herself from the deadly trap. The bombardment was so successful that the next day General Ulysses Grant safely moved his troops across the Mississippi to begin the operations which at long last isolated and captured Vicksburg. Hoel was promoted to Acting Volunteer Lieutenant Commander on 10 November 1864. In command of USS Vindicator Detached from Pittsburg, he then took command of USS Vindicator 1 March 1865 on which he served until 7 July 1865. He was honorably discharged on 30 December 1865. Postwar career and death Hoel returned to piloting, was active in the Grand Army of the Republic, and eventually served as master of the lighthouse tender Lily. He married a second time but became suspicious of his wife Elizabeth's relationship with a local doctor. He confronted them with a pistol in May 1879 but was shot and killed in the struggle. After an inquest, the doctor was not charged with any crime.McCaul, Edward B., To Retain Command of the Mississippi: The Civil War Naval Campaign for Memphis (Univ. of Tennessee Press 2014), pp. 183-184 References External links * Category:1824 births Category:1879 deaths Category:Union Navy officers Category:People from Butler County, Ohio Category:United States Navy officers Category:People of Ohio in the American Civil War ","title":"William R.

He received 38 awards during his lifetime and had been a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature on the strength of Memed, My Hawk.http://www.yasarkemal.net/eng/awards/index.html An outspoken intellectual, he often did not hesitate to speak about sensitive issues, especially those concerning the oppression of the Kurdish people. He was tried in 1995 under anti-terror laws for an article he wrote for Der Spiegel highlighting the Turkish Army's destruction of Kurdish villages during the Turkish-Kurdish conflict. He was released but later received a suspended 20-month jail sentence for another article he wrote criticising racism in Turkey, especially against the Kurds. Life He was born Kemal Sadik G√∂k√ßeli to Sadƒ±k and Nig√¢r on 6 October 1923 in Hemite (now G√∂k√ßedam),https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/01/yasar- kemalhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/28/yasar-kemal-celebrated- turkish-novelist-dies-at-91 a hamlet in the province of Osmaniye in southern Turkey. He was born into the only Kurdish family in the village.https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/01/yasar-kemal His family had Caucasian and Assyrian origins. Kemal had a difficult childhood, and his family had to flee from Van Province to Diyarbakƒ±r Province. From there, they were deported to Adana Province. He lost his right eye in a knife accident when his father was slaughtering a sheep on Eid al-Adha. When he was five years old he witnessed his father being stabbed to death by his adoptive son Yusuf while praying in a mosque. These traumatic experiences left Kemal with a speech impediment, which lasted until he was twelve years old. At nine, Kemal began school in a neighboring village, and later he continued his formal education in Kadirli, Osmaniye Province. Kemal was a locally noted bard before he began school but was unappreciated by his widowed mother until he composed an elegy on the death of one of her eight brothers, all of whom were bandits. He became interested in writing as a means to record his work after talking to an itinerant peddler, who was doing his accounts. His village paid his way to university in Istanbul. He worked for a while for rich farmers, as a labourer in cotton fields and ostensibly guarding river water against poor farmers' unauthorized irrigation. However, instead he taught the poor farmers how to steal the water undetected, by taking it at night. Later he worked as a letter-writer, then as a journalist, and finally as a novelist. The Turkish police confiscated his first two novels. In 1950, Kemal was imprisoned for alleged communist activities.https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/01/yasar-kemal He visited Akdamar Island in 1951, where he saw the beginning of the planned demolition of the island's Holy Cross Church. Using his contacts, he helped stop the demolition (the church was restored by the Turkish government in 2005). He then moved to Istanbul to work for the Cumhuriyet newspaper, where he adopted his pen name.https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ya%C5%9Far_Kemal&action;=submit In 1962, Kemal joined the Workers Party of Turkey (TIP) and \\"served as one of its leaders until quitting after the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968\\". Because of the spate of political assassinations during the 1976‚Äì1980 political violence in Turkey, Kemal moved to Sweden for a time. He was often arrested for his political activities.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/28/yasar-kemal- celebrated-turkish-novelist-dies-at-91 In 1995, he was prosecuted for making separatist propaganda after writing an article for Index on Censorship, because of his support for Kurdish dissidents. He was sentenced to 20 months and received a suspended sentence in March 1996. In December 2000, he was involved in negotiations concerning the hunger strikes against the F-Type prisons.http://bianet.org/english/print/25537-death-fasts-107-died-one-still- fasting =Marriages= In 1952, Ya≈üar Kemal married Thilda Serrero, a member of a prominent Sephardi Jewish family in Istanbul. Her grandfather, Jak Mandil Pasha, was the chief physician of the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II. She translated 17 of her husband‚Äôs works into the English language. Thilda predeceased Ya≈üar on 17 January 2001 (aged 78) from pulmonary complications at a hospital in Istanbul, and was buried at Zincirlikuyu Cemetery. Thilda was also survived by her son Ra≈üit G√∂ƒü√ßel and a grandchild. Alt URL Ya≈üar Kemal remarried on 1 August 2002. His second spouse was Ay≈üe Semiha Baban, a lecturer for public relations at the Bilgi University in Istanbul. She was educated at the American University of Beirut, Bosphorus University and Harvard University. Later years and death On 14 January 2015 Kemal was hospitalized at Istanbul University's √áapa Medical Faculty, due to respiratory insufficiency. During the afternoon of 28 February 2015, in the intensive care unit, where he had been admitted owing to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, he died. Following a religious funeral service held at Te≈üvikiye Mosque, attended by former Turkish president Abdullah Gul, political party leaders, high-ranking officials and an enormous assembly of mourners, he was buried on 2 March 2015 beside his first wife Thilda's grave in Zincirlikuyu Cemetery. Kemal is survived by his wife Ay≈üe Semiha Baban and his adoptive son, visual artist Ahmet G√ºne≈ütekin. Works Kemal published his first book Aƒüƒ±tlar (\\"Ballads\\") in 1943, which was a compilation of folkloric themes. This book brought to light many long forgotten rhymes and ballads. He had begun to collect these ballads at the age of 16.Ya≈üar Kemal ‚Äì YKY His first stories Bebek (\\"The Baby\\"), D√ºkkancƒ± (\\"The Shopkeeper\\") and Memet ile Memet (\\"Memet and Memet\\") were published in 1950. He penned his first tale Pis Hikaye (\\"The Dirty Story\\") in 1944, while he was serving in the military, in Kayseri. Then he published his book of short stories Sarƒ± Sƒ±cak (\\"Yellow Heat\\") in 1952. The initial point of his works was the toil of the people of the √áukurova plains and he based the themes of his writings on the lives and sufferings of these people. Kemal used the legends and stories of Anatolia extensively as the basis for his works. He received international acclaim with the publication of Memed, My Hawk () in 1955. In ƒ∞nce Memed, Kemal criticizes the fabric of the society through a legendary hero, a protagonist, who flees to the mountains as a result of the oppression of the Aghas. One of the most famous writers in Turkey, Kemal was noted for his command of the language and lyrical description of bucolic Turkish life. He was awarded 19 literary prizes during his lifetime and nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1973. His 1955 novel Teneke was adapted into a theatrical play, which was staged for almost one year in Gothenburg, Sweden, in the country where he lived for about two years in the late 1970s. Italian composer Fabio Vacchi adapted the same novel with the original title into an opera of three acts, which premiered at the Teatro alla Scala in Milano, Italy in 2007. Kemal was a major contributor to Turkish literature in the early years after the language's recreation as a literary language following Atat√ºrk's Reforms of the 1930s.

Description Attwater's prairie chicken measures 17‚Äì18 in (43-45.5 cm) and weighs roughly 1.5 to 2.0 lb (0.7 to 0.9 kg). It has a 28-in (70-cm) wingspan. These grouse have strong vertical bars of dark brown and buff-white pattern over the mantle, flanks, and underparts. The species exhibits sexual dimorphism, with the males having elongated feathers, called pinnae, erected to form what looks like ear-like structures. The male also has as a bright orange or golden air sac on either side of his neck, which he inflates during mating displays. They have a lifespan of two to five years. Habitat and range T. c. attwateri is endemic to the Western Gulf coastal grasslands. Its range historically stretched west from Bayou Teche in Louisiana to the Nueces River in Texas, possibly as far south as Tamaulipas, Mexico, and inland for . This covered an area of 6 million acres (24,000 km¬≤). Today, populations exist in the wild at two locations: the Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge near Eagle Lake, Texas, and on private lands in Goliad County. Reproduction The mating display can be seen January through mid-May, peaking in mid-March, when the birds gather in small groups on short grass, bare ground, or hilly areas to choose a mate. This area is called a lek or \\"booming ground.\\" In these areas, the females watch the males and choose their mate. The male emits a booming, \\"woo-woo\\" sound from his neck sack, causing it to inflate, and struts around to attract a female. Some of the traditional dances of the North American Plains Indians are based on this booming display. In late spring, the hens lay 10 to 14 eggs in nests on the ground, hidden in tall grass. The eggs hatch about 26 days later. Only about 3 in 10 eggs hatch and the others are lost to predators. The chicks stay with the hen for about six weeks. Diet and predation This species has a diverse diet, eating grass shoots, petals of flowers, seeds, and insects such as grasshoppers. Their predators include hawks, owls, coyotes, raccoons, skunks, opossums, and snakes. Chicks are susceptible to flooding. Conservation In 1900, up to 1,000,000 Attwater's prairie chickens inhabited the coastal grasslands. Loss of habitat is believed to be the prime reason for their decline. One of the major factors contributing to the habitat loss was the widespread planting, beginning in the early 1900s, of Chinese tallow trees (Triadica sebifera) to establish a soapmaking industry.Flack, S. & E. Furlow. 1996. \\"America's least wanted \\"purple plague\\", \\"green cancer\\" and 10 other ruthless environmental thugs\\". Nature Conservancy Magazine. Vol. 46, No. 6 November/December. Since that time, T. sebifera has proven to be an aggressive invader of the coastal grasslands, where it displaces the diverse native plant assemblage that was dominated by prairie grasses and forbs with dense, near-monospecific stands that significantly alter biotic and abiotic ecosystem processes.Bruce, K. A., G. N. Cameron, & P. A. Harcombe. 1995. \\"Initiation of a new woodland type on the Texas coastal prairie by the Chinese tallow tree (Sapium sebiferum (L.) Roxb.)\\". Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club 122:215-225. Urbanization further contributes to habitat loss. As a result of these changes over the last 100 years, the entire grassland ecosystem where Attwater's prairie chicken once thrived exists in small, scattered patches whose continued existence is threatened. Where once grazing plains bison and periodic wildfires due to lightning reduced brush, the birds now have difficulty making their way through thick undergrowth. Other, less- apparent changes in the ecosystem possibly have had an effect, as well. A 1937 study recorded about 8,700 Attwater's prairie chickens remaining in four Texas counties. Attwater's prairie chicken has been on the endangered species list since March 1967 when an estimated 1,070 birds were left in the wild. By 2003, there were fewer than 50 birds left in the wild. In 1999, Nature Conservancy decided to permit new drilling close to primary breeding grounds on Texas land owned by the Conservancy. This has harmed the grouse and their habitat, according to the Wildlife Society. Drilling in sensitive areas is destructive and opposed by environmentalists. The number of Attwater's prairie chickens nesting on the land owned by the Conservancy fell from 36 in 1998 to 16 in 2003. Analysis by Nature Conservancy's Texas science director said that that new oil drilling project subjected the grouse to a \\"higher probability of death.\\" In 2007, Nature Conservancy issued new permits to drill a new oil well on protected land. right In 2014, an estimated 260 birds remained, with about 100 living in the wild. Captive-breeding programs are underway at places such as Fossil Rim Wildlife Center, Abilene Zoo, and Caldwell Zoo (Tyler, TX). Through a partnership with the Houston Zoo, a captive-breeding flock is residing on the grounds of the NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center near Clear Lake. In 2016, the population declined to 42 birds following heavy spring floods, which wiped out an entire generation of eggs. Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was even more disastrous, likely killing at least 32 birds, with only five females found during the post-hurricane survey of the area. However, in the spring of 2018, the estimated wild population was 12.http://www.fortbendstar.com/attwaters-prairie-chickens-dealt-critical-blow- by-hurricane-harvey/ As of February 2019, with the Houston Zoo releasing many individuals the previous year, the wild population is around 200.https://www.houstonchronicle.com/life/features/article/Match-com-for- chickens-Houston-Zoo-s-13613853.php See also *Heath hen *Henry Philemon Attwater References External links * Fight to save a prairie chicken The New York Times, 2015 * Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge * Texas Parks and Wildlife on the Attwater's Prairie Chicken * National Geographic Article * Fossil Rim Wildlife Center * Handbook of Texas Online * Houston Zoo Category:Tympanuchus Category:Birds described in 1893 Category:Endangered fauna of the United States Category:Endemic birds of the Plains-Midwest (United States) Category:ESA endangered species Category:Species endangered by invasive species Category:Taxa named by Charles Bendire ","title":"Attwater's prairie chicken"},{"id":"1264572","text":"Carnarvon Hall, SH1 north of Himitangi Crossroads Himatangi is a small settlement in the Manawat≈´-Whanganui region of New Zealand's North Island.

History The area was largely undeveloped with rough terrain in 1942, according to a photograph held in the National Library of New Zealand. Himatangi was once the location of the junction between the New Zealand Railways Department's Foxton Branch railway and the Manawatu County Council's Sanson Tramway. Both lines are now closed; use of the Tramway ceased in 1945, followed by the Branch in 1959. In 2005, a study found agricultural pesticides were being rapidly leached into the sandy soil at Himatangi. In 2009, planning approval was granted for the building of a piggery after the landowner agreed to reduce from what he originally proposed. In 2014, the community was used as a trial community for the Horizons Regional Council's emergency readiness plan. The landowner and New Zealand Pork Board had been considering legal action through the Environment Court. In 2019 a regional bus service between Levin and Palmerston North was introduced, providing a weekly return service between Himatangi and Foxton.

While listening to some of the music that created in the studio, Ridgway jokingly compared the multiple-drum-machine- and Farfisa-organ-laden recordings to Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, whereupon the friend commented it sounded more like a \\"wall of voodoo\\" and the name stuck. Wall of Voodoo's music could fairly be described as a cross between early synthesizer pop and Ennio Morricone's soundtracks for Italian director Sergio Leone's epic western films of the 1960s. Adding to the music's distinctiveness was percussive and textural experimentation, i.e. mixing drum machines with unconventional instruments such as pots, pans and various kitchen utensils, raw electronics with interlocking melodic figures as well as twangy spaghetti-western guitar. On top of the mix was Ridgway's unusual vocal style and highly stylized, cinematic narratives heavily influenced by science fiction and film noir, sung from the perspective of ordinary folks and characters wrestling with ironies inside the American Dream. Solo career Ridgway embarked on a solo career in 1983, shortly after Wall of Voodoo's appearance at the US Festival that same year. After collaborating on the song, \\"Don't Box Me In\\" with Stewart Copeland from the Police for the soundtrack to Francis Ford Coppola's Rumble Fish starring Mickey Rourke, Matt Dillon and Dennis Hopper, he released his first proper solo album, The Big Heat (1986), which included the top 5 European (including UK) hit \\"Camouflage\\". This was followed by numerous other solo recordings: Mosquitos (1989), Partyball (1991), Black Diamond (1995), and Anatomy (1999), The Way I Feel Today (1998), a collection of big band standards, and Holiday in Dirt (2002), a compilation of outtakes and previously unreleased songs. Ridgway's album Snakebite: Blacktop Ballads and Fugitive Songs (2005), features the narrative song, \\"Talkin' Wall Of Voodoo Blues Pt. 1\\", a history of his former band in song. Since the early days of Wall of Voodoo, Ridgway has been interested in making music for the cinema. A list of films for which Ridgway has written scores and/or original songs is included below. Ridgway's album Holiday in Dirt was a quasi-cinematic project, with the release of the album accompanied by a showing of 14 short films by various independent filmmakers, each film a visual interpretation of one of the songs on the album. A compilation DVD of the films was released in February 2005. Stan Ridgway (r) performing with Pietra Wexstun (l) in 2005 In 1994, Ridgway began work on a new project in the form of a trio called Drywall, the other members of the trio being Ridgway's wife, keyboardist/vocalist Pietra Wexstun of the band Hecate's Angels (who had previously worked with Ridgway on Mosquitos and Partyball), and former Rain Parade drummer Ivan Knight. In 1995, Drywall released its first album (first of a \\"trilogy of apocalyptic documents\\"), titled Work the Dumb Oracle. A short film directed by Carlos Grasso titled The Drywall Incident was released the same year. An extended, instrumental soundtrack album for The Drywall Incident was released in 1996. Ridgway and Wexstun also collaborated and forayed into new musical territory, composing a suite of mostly instrumental and orchestral pieces to accompany an exhibition of postmodern surrealist artist Mark Ryden's paintings after being introduced by a mutual friend, Sean P. Riley, who toured with Wall Of Voodoo on their 1982 \\"Call of the West ‚Äì Tour of Virtue\\" as the band's merchandiser. The album was released on CD in 2003 as Blood ‚Äì Miniature Paintings of Sorrow and Fear in a unique 3-panel packaging design by the artist which quickly sold out of its limited pressing of 7,500. Ridgway plays banjo and harmonica in Wexstun's group Hecate's Angels. Stan Ridgway and Drywall regrouped in 2006 to release the album Barbeque Babylon, the third \\"apocalyptic document\\" with the single \\"The AARP Is After Me\\". The new Drywall lineup features Rick King on guitars and bass and Bruce Zelesnik on drums and percussion. In 2008 Ridgway and Wexstun released \\"Silly Songs For Kids Vol. 1\\", a collection of children's songs that feature the duo and also saxophonist and woodwind player Ralph Carney. Ridgway has also contributed to albums and projects by producer Hal Willner, Frank Black and the Catholics, the Flesh Eaters, the Divine Horsemen, The Ray Campi Quartet, the Fibonaccis, and Roger McGuinn. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Stan Ridgway among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

Young (born ) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1999 to 2003. He represented the riding of Willowdale and served as a cabinet minister in the governments of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves. Background Young was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario. He was educated at Osgoode Hall Law School of York University in Toronto, and practised law after his graduation. He worked at the firm of Benson McMurtry from 1981 to 1987, and has been a partner in Benson Percival Brown since 1987.http://bensonpercival.com/david-s-young/ Young has also served as a director of the Canadian Society for Yad Vashem, and was for ten years an executive member of the Ratepayer's Association. He and his wife Ellen live in Toronto, Ontario, where they raised three children. Politics He began his political career as a school trustee, serving on the North York Public School Board from 1991 to 1997. In the provincial election of 1999, he was elected to the Ontario legislature for the north Toronto riding of Willowdale, defeating Liberal candidate Fahimeh Mortazavi by about 3,500 votes. Young was named Attorney General and Minister responsible for Native Affairs in the government of Mike Harris on February 8, 2001. He was generally regarded as one of the more centrist figures in Harris's government, and supported Ernie Eves to replace Harris as Premier in 2002. When Eves was sworn into office on April 15, 2002, he kept Young in the Attorney-General's portfolio. In 2002, Young introduced the Legal Aid Services Amendment Act (Bill 181), which permitted Legal Aid Ontario to hire staff lawyers and contract with individual lawyers and law firms. Many criticized this intermingling of the private and public sectors, and suggested that the bill would lead to the introduction of a two- tier legal system in Ontario. Young also increased the hourly payment rates of Legal Aid Ontario workers by 5% an hour. After a cabinet shuffle on February 25, 2003, Young became the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. Many expected that Young would be re-elected in the provincial election of 2003, despite a general decline in Tory support throughout Toronto. Young's performance in cabinet was generally respected, and he was sometimes described as a possible successor to Eves as party leader. The provincial trend, however, was too much to overcome: the Tories were defeated in all of their Toronto seats, and Young lost the Willowdale riding to Liberal candidate David Zimmer by 1,866 votes. In 2014, David served as a senior advisor, executive committee member and legal counsel to the successful John Tory campaign for Mayor of Toronto. =Cabinet positions= References External links * Category:1957 births Category:Attorneys General of Ontario Category:Living people Category:Members of the Executive Council of Ontario Category:Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario MPPs Category:21st-century Canadian politicians ","title":"David Young (Ontario politician)"},{"id":"1264585","text":"David or Dave Young may refer to: Entertainment * David Young (Canadian playwright) (born 1946), Canadian playwright and novelist * David Young (novelist) (born 1958), British novelist * David Young (judge), daytime court television show judge in Miami * Judge David Young, daytime court television show * David Young (TV producer), British game show producer * David Young (Neighbours), fictional character on Australian soap opera Neighbours * David Young, founding editor of the Farmers' Almanac, 1818 * David Young, writer and actor for CollegeHumor web site Music * David Young (saxophonist, 1912-1992) (1912‚Äì1992), American jazz tenor saxophonist * Dave Young (bassist) (born 1940), Canadian jazz double bassist * Dave Young (musician) (born 1982), Canadian rock musician * David Young (musician) (active from 1990), American recorder musician * David Young (composer), American video game music composer  Politics * David Young (Labour politician) (1930‚Äì2003), British Labour Party MP, 1974‚Äì1997 * David Young, Baron Young of Graffham (born 1932), British politician and Cabinet minister from the 1980s * David Young (Ontario politician) (born 1957), Canadian politician in Ontario * David Young (Watergate) (born 1936), member of a covert ops team under U.S. President Richard Nixon * David Young (Iowa politician) (born 1968), former member of the U.S. House of Representatives * David Young (North Carolina politician) (born 1959), businessman and Chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party * Dave Young (Colorado politician), member of the Colorado House of Representatives * David Young III (1905‚Äì?), American politician in New Jersey Sports =Football and rugby= * David Young (footballer, born 1945), English footballer for Newcastle, Sunderland, Charlton, and Southend in the 1970s * David Young (Australian footballer) (born 1954), Australian rules footballer for South Melbourne and Collingwood * Dave Young (American football) (born 1959), tight end selected in the 1981 NFL Draft * David Young (footballer, born 1965), English footballer for Darlington in the 1980s * David Young (gridiron football) (born 1979), defensive back selected in the 2003 NFL Draft * Dai Young (born 1967), Welsh rugby union and Rugby league international and British Lion * Dave Young (rugby union) (born 1985), Irish rugby union player * Dave Young (footballer), former Wigan Athletic player =Other sports= * David Turquand-Young (1904‚Äì1984), British modern pentathlete * David Young (swimmer) (1907‚Äì1988), American Olympic swimmer * David Young (wrestler) (born 1972), American professional wrestler * David Young (cricketer) (born 1977), English cricketer * David Young (basketball) (born 1981), drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics * David Young (hurler) (born 1985), Irish sportsperson * David Young (rower), English rower Other * David Young (bishop) (1931‚Äì2008), British Anglican bishop; Bishop of Ripon * David Young (cleric) (1844‚Äì1913), Wesleyan minister and historian * David G.

Common names for species in this genus include Turk's cap mallow, wax mallow, sleeping hibiscus, and mazapan. It belongs to a group of genera that differ from the closely related Hibiscus in possessing a fruit divided into 5 separate parts (a schizocarp), and having a style surmounted by 10, rather than 5, capitate or capitellate stigmas. Among those genera Malvaviscus is distinguished by having auriculate petals and red, fleshy fruits. The generic name is derived from the Latin words malva, meaning \\"mallow,\\" and viscus, which means \\"sticky,\\" referring to the mucilaginous sap produced by members of the genus. The fruit can be used to make jelly or syrup. Both the fruit and flowers are used to make herbal teas.http://www.dirtdoctor.com/Turks- Cap_vq373.htm accessed 22.11.2012 Selected species * Malvaviscus achanioides (Turcz.)

The 10,528 acre (43 km¬≤) refuge, located in eastern Colorado County, approximately 60 miles (100 km) west of Houston, Texas, was established in 1972, and is one of a handful of national wildlife refuges managed specifically for an endangered species. In 1968, Attwater Prairie Chicken Preserve was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service. In the mid-1960s, the World Wildlife Fund purchased of land to preserve some remaining coastal prairie for the Attwater's Prairie Chicken. The land was transferred to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in 1972, which brought the refuge up to its current acreage. Many of the Attwater's prairie chickens in the refuge are hatched at captive breeding programs at Fossil Rim Wildlife Center, Texas A&M; University, SeaWorld San Antonio, Abilene Zoo, Caldwell Zoo, Houston Zoo, and San Antonio Zoo. Chicks are fitted with a radio transmitter and released at the refuge once they are capable of independent survival. To maintain the prairie ecosystem, the refuge staff does prescribed burns of to annually in January or February. The burns help invigorate the grasses by removing dead stems and control the growth of brush and invasive species of plants. The staff also converts formerly cultivated land in the refuge back to prairie by replanting native grasses. Over 250 species of birds in addition to the Attwater's prairie chicken have been observed in the refuge. Some of these include the fulvous whistling duck, black-bellied whistling duck, white-tailed hawk, northern caracara, scissor-tailed flycatcher, dickcissel, roseate spoonbill, anhinga, Sprague's pipit, and sandhill crane. Mammals in the refuge include plains bison, thirteen-lined ground squirrel, bobcats, coyotes, nine- banded armadillo, and white-tailed deer. American alligators share the ponds with softshell turtles. American bullfrog and upland chorus frog calls are heard in the refuge. Indian paintbrush, bluebonnets, and Butterfly milkweed are some of the many wildflowers that bloom in the park. The refuge has an auto tour and two hiking trails. The auto tour loop winds through five miles (8 km) of coastal prairie habitat. The Pipit Trail to the Refuge Lake is 1.5 miles. The Sycamore Trail transects of coastal prairie as well as a section of forest in the Coushatta Creek bottomland.

The record label was founded in 1996 by Michael S. Berberian in Marseille, France. From the start releasing black metal, pagan metal and death metal records, the label moved on to releasing albums of avant-garde metal, gothic metal and punk bands as well. The label has two offices, one in Marseille, France and one in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Music From the beginning, Season of Mist focused on releasing more extreme metal records by stylistically diverse bands like Oxiplegatz, Bethzaida and Kampfar. With the signing of Norwegian legends Mayhem in 1999, the label's profile clearly shifted towards black metal and attracted internationally renowned artists like Carpathian Forest, Rotting Christ, Arcturus and Solefald, with the latter two representing a marked progressive and avant-garde side to Season of Mist. While staying close to its black metal roots with the creation of the Season of Mist Underground Activists division in 2007, the label widened its musical range and added to its black, death, doom (Saint Vitus) and thrash metal roster bands playing progressive death metal (Morbid Angel, Cynic, Atheist, Gnostic, Gonin-ish), sludge (Kylesa, Outlaw Order), industrial metal (Genitorturers, The CNK, Punish Yourself), hard rock (Ace Frehley), gothic rock (Christian Death), mathcore (The Dillinger Escape Plan, Psykup), garage rock (1969 Was Fine), groove metal (Dagoba, Eths, Trepalium, Black Comedy) and metalcore (Eyeless, The Arrs). History Season of Mist was formed in 1996, while founder Michael S. Berberian was completing his scholarships in \\"International Economics Sciences\\" initially, according to Berberian, to avoid the compulsory national military service in France. Since his graduation the label has become a full-time job for Michael and achieved a steady growth with Season of Mist now employing 20 staff members. In 2002 Season of Mist also started out as a distributor for the French territory, which includes other metal labels like Spinefarm Records or Napalm Records on their roster. Season of Mist's name originates from A Midsummer Night's Dream, the play by William Shakespeare.

It is also the name of a cross country ski race at Giant's Ridge Ski Area in Biwabik, Minnesota, an event sponsored by Pepsi. Method An early 1980s \\"Pepsi Challenge\\" 16 oz. (355 ml.) promotional can, and a metal tab button publicizing the challenge. The challenge originally took the form of a single blind taste test. At malls, shopping centers, and other public locations, a Pepsi representative sets up a table with two white cups: one containing Pepsi and one with Coca-Cola. Shoppers are encouraged to taste both colas, and then select which drink they prefer. Then the representative reveals the two bottles so the taster can see whether they preferred Coke or Pepsi. The results of the test leaned toward a consensus that Pepsi was preferred by more Americans. History and criticism The challenge launched in 1975, as part of the ongoing Cola wars between Pepsi and The Coca-Cola Company. A Coca-Cola pinback button, \\"I picked Coke in the Pepsi Challenge.\\" In his book Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking (2005), author Malcolm Gladwell presents evidence that suggests Pepsi's success over Coca- Cola in the \\"Pepsi Challenge\\" is a result of the flawed nature of the \\"sip test\\" method. His research shows that tasters will generally prefer the sweeter of two beverages based on a single sip, even if they prefer a less sweet beverage over the course of an entire can. When the preference in blind tests is compared to tests wherein cups are labeled with arbitrary labels (e.g., S or L) or brand names, the ratings of preference change.Woolfolk, Castellan, Brooks Scientific findings do support a perceptible difference between Coca-Cola and Pepsi, but not between Pepsi and RC Cola.Pronko, Herman In his book, Bad Habits, humorist Dave Barry describes the Pepsi challenge as, \\"Pepsi‚Äôs ongoing misguided attempt to convince the general public that Coke and Pepsi are not the same thing, which of course they are.\\"Barry, Dave. Bad Habits, pp. 75, c.1985, Holt & Co. In 2015, Pepsi relaunched the Pepsi Challenge on social media. As part of this year long promotion, Pepsi signed various celebrity ambassadors to advertise their product on their social media accounts under the hashtag #PepsiChallenge.

Janusz I of Warsaw (pl: Janusz I warszawski), also known as Janusz I the Old (pl: Janusz I Starszy) (c. 1347/52Kazimierz Jasi≈Ñski: Rodow√≥d Piast√≥w mazowieckich. Pozna≈Ñ - Wroc≈Çaw 1998, p. 79. ‚Äì 8 December 1429), was a Polish prince member of the House of Piast in the Masovian branch, from 1373/74 Duke of Warsaw and after the division of the paternal inheritance between him and his brother in 1381, ruler over Nur, ≈Åom≈ºa, Liw, Ciechan√≥w, Wyszogr√≥d and Zakroczym. In addition, he was a vassal of the Polish Kingdom since 1391 for the fief of Podlachia (only during his lifetime). He was the eldest son of Siemowit III, Duke of Masovia and his first wife Euphemia, daughter of Nicholas II of Opava. Due to an error of chronicler Jan D≈Çugosz was previously assumed that Janusz I was born c. 1329, and it wasn't until modern time that this date could be corrected until a much later one, c. 1346. Evidence of this fact was that only in 1373/74 he received his own duchy (with its capital in Warsaw). As the result of the partition of Masovia between him and his younger brother Siemowit IV after the death of their father on 16 June 1381, Janusz I finally obtain the totally of his domains: Warsaw, Nur, ≈Åom≈ºa, Liw, Ciechan√≥w, Wyszogr√≥d and Zakroczym. Policy with the Kingdom of Poland In this area, Janusz I faithfully maintained a close cooperation with the successive Polish rulers: Louis of Anjou, Jadwiga and W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço. One expression of this were the three homages performed by him in the years 1373, 1383 and 1387. In this way, Janusz I was directly opposed to the policy of his brother Siemowit IV, who tried to take advantage of the difficulties in the Angevin dynasty and wanted to obtain the Polish crown for himself. After the death of King Louis of Poland and Hungary, Janusz I recognized the rights of Jadwiga to the Polish crown. To this end, in 1383 he went to Buda, where he offered support forces, in return for which he received a salary of 24,000 florins per year taken from the salt mines of Bochnia. His pro-Angevin policies soon caused that Janusz would be protected from the army of the future Sigismund of Luxemburg, the future Holy Roman Emperor, in his way to rescue his future wife Mary, Queen of Hungary and Jadwiga's sister. Policy towards Lithuania and seizure of Podlachia Division of Masovia (1381‚Äì1426). The preference for the Polish interests in W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço in detriment of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania caused a civil war between him and his uncle Kƒôstutis. Janusz I took advantage of this situation in 1382 to capture the towns of Podlachia and Drohiczyn, claiming them as a part of the dowry of his wife Danutƒó (a daughter of Kƒôstutis),Katalog Zabytk√≥w Sztuki w Polsce \\"Siemiatycze, Drohiczyn i okolice\\", Warsaw 1996, p. 6. with he had married around 1371/73. This acquisition, however, wasn't permanent, because later in that year, the Polish King, after finally defeated his uncle, managed to recover this lands. Janusz I, not wanting to further complicated the situation, received with extreme coldness the fugitive Vytautas, despite being his brother-in-law, and after his refusal to accept baptism sent him to the Teutonic Knights. The relations between W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço and Janusz I where repaired only in 1387, when the Duke of Warsaw after the election of W≈Çadys≈Çaw II as King of Poland, formally recognized him recognized and then took part in the royal trip to Vilnius, the first step of the Christianization of Lithuania. His good relations with W≈Çadys≈Çaw II where became even more notorious in 1389 during a visit of Vytautas to Masovia, during which Janusz I, in the middle of a feast, declined a golden cup offered to him by Vytautas, which was considered as an insult. On 2 September 1391 W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço formally gave Janusz I the previously disputed lands of Podlachia and Drohiczyn in perpetuity, and with them he also received the towns of Mielnik, Bielsk Podlaski and Sura≈º (\\"terram nostram Drohiczensen, Melnyk, Surasz, Byelsko ac omnibus villis in eisdem districtubus\\"). Policy towards the Teutonic Knights The friendly relations between Janusz I and W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço caused a permanent state of hostility between Masovia from the Teutonic Order. In 1393, and for unknown reasons, Janusz I was capturedJanusz (Jan) I Starszy (Mazowiecki) in: poczet.com [retrieved 10 January 2015]. during a visit to the border castle in Z≈Çotoryja near Narew by the komturs of Balga and Ragnit and imprisoned at Malbork Castle by orders of the Grand Master, Konrad von Jungingen. Probably with this actions they wanted to provoke the Polish for war with the Order. As a result of the intervention of W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, who sent deputies to the Teutonic Knights, Janusz I was released. In 1404 the Knights again captured Janusz I, this time with his wife and sons, and kept them in Saxony. Again, only the intervention of the Polish King could released them. In August 1409 the komturs of Ostr√≥da and Pokarmin invaded Janusz's domains. In retaliation, Janusz I's son Boles≈Çaw destroyed Dzia≈Çdowo and 14 surrounding villages. Coat of arms of Janus I. Between 1409-1411 Janusz I continued his support to W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço in the great war against the Teutonic Order and fielded a banner of cavalryHis banner had in its badge a quartered field, in two quarters a white eagle in a red field and the other two quarters had a winged dragon (or a basilisk) in a white field. Andrzej Klein, Nikolas Sekunda, Konrad A. Czernielewski: Banderia Apud Grunwald, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ 2000, pp. 60-61. to aid the Polish King. In the village of Czerwi≈Ñsk nad Wis≈ÇƒÖ, Janusz I designated the place of concentration of the united Polish-Lithuanian army. From there him, at the head his army organized their squadrons of knights and went to Grunwald, where on 15 July 1410 took place the battle. Janusz I then participated in the rest of the campaign. W≈Çadys≈Çaw II, as way to recompensate his fidelity, give to him the Teutonic castles of Nidzica, Ostr√≥da and Olsztyn. However, this acquisitions weren't permanent, because seven months later (1 February 1411) after the sign of the Peace of Thorn, he was forced to return the castles to the Teutonic Order. When in 1414 another war broke out with the Teutonic Knights (the called Hunger War), Janusz I again decided to support the King. This time, however, probably because of his advanced age, he didn't participated directly in the campaign but send his son Boles≈Çaw. Internal Policy and Reforms In domestic politics, Janusz I took a thorough reform of the economic policies of the principality given the German Kulm law to 24 cities including Czersk (1383), Ciechan√≥w (1400), R√≥≈ºan (1403), Warsaw New Town (1408), Drohiczyn (1408), ≈Åom≈ºa (1418), Gr√≥jec (1419), Mak√≥w Mazowiecki and Mi≈Ñsk Mazowiecki (1421), KolnoE.

An extremely important step took place in 1406, when he moved his capital from Czersk to newly developing strategic town of Warsaw and actively worked to develop his towns, fortified his castles and strongholds. A clear sign of this develop was the creation of a Collegiate at St. John Church and the build of a castle (who was later known as the oldest part of the future Royal Palace). Among the most notorious castles fortified during this time are the former capital Czersk, Liw and Ciechan√≥w. Marriage and Issue Around 23 November 1371/73, Janusz I married the Lithuanian princess Danutƒó (c. 1358 - c. 24 November 1424) -who in baptism took the name Ana-, a daughter of Kƒôstutis and sister of Vytautas, both Dukes of Trakai and Grand Dukes of Lithuania; in consequence, she was a first-cousin of the later King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço of Poland (born Jogaila, son of Algirdas, a brother of Kƒôstutis). The union produced at least four children: * Daughter (Olga?) (1373/76 - c. 8 December 1401), who married firstly in 1388 to Voivode Petru I of Moldavia and secondly with the Moldavian magnate Wilczƒô. * Janusz (1376/81 - c. 18 October 1422). * Boles≈Çaw (1385/86 - c. 4 May 1424). * Konrad (c. 1400 - 9 December 1412/13). Janusz I survived all his children and passed, by testament, his domains to his eldest surviving grandson, Boles≈Çaw IV (son of the second son, Boles≈Çaw). He died on 8 December 1429 at Czersk, and was buried at St. John's Archcathedral, Warsaw.

It is longer than most regular shirts, reaching down below the knees, leaving some of the legs uncovered. In the US, it also sometimes means a shirt, slightly longer than a regular shirt, reaching down to the thighs, worn as loungewear and nightwear. Traditional nightshirts are used just for nightwear, removed and stored away for next use upon waking. This other, non-traditional type is worn with pajama bottoms. Until the 16th century men slept naked or in a day-shirt. Nobles in the 16th century then wore embroidered shirts or \\"wrought night-shirts\\". By the 19th century the night-shirt resembled a day-shirt with a loose, turned-down collar and similar length as a nightgown.

Bathrobes may sometimes be worn after a body wash or around a pool. A bathrobe is a dressing gown made from towelling or other absorbent fabric and may be donned while the wearer's body is wet, serving both as a towel and a body covering when there is no immediate need to fully dress.  Styles of fabrics  Bathrobes are generally made of four different fabrics: *Cotton: Cotton is a natural fibre consisting primarily of cellulose and is one of the most commonly used fibres in textile manufacturing. Due to the hydrophilic nature of cellulose, cotton absorbs water easily and is frequently used by the beach, pool, or following a shower. Cotton robes are especially suited to use in hot climates because cotton tends to absorb perspiration. *Silk: Silk dressing gowns are popular because of their look and feel, but can be relatively expensive. Silk robes are very thin and lightweight, and are not particularly suited to wet situations because they lack the surface area and polarity necessary to absorb water. However, silk dressing gowns are the traditional choice, since they are not worn after bathing. *Microfiber: Microfiber is an extremely fine synthetic fiber, typically made of cellulose or polyester, that can be woven into textiles to mimic natural-fiber cloth. Modern microfibers are developed to maximize breathability and water absorption and can be thinner than the width of human hair. Much like silk, robes made out of microfiber are light in weight and are very soft to the touch. Microfiber is flammable. *Wool: Wool bathrobes are common in colder climates. *Nylon: Nylon is a synthetic fibre occasionally used in inexpensive dressing gowns. It is valued for its ability to be cleaned easily.  Styles of weave  Bathrobes are also categorized by their shape of weave: *Flannel: Flannel is a soft woven fabric, made from loosely spun yarn, usually cotton or wool. *Terry: Terry is a pile fabric, usually woven of cotton, with uncut loops on both sides, used for bath towels and robes. The longer and denser the loops are, the more absorbent the bathrobes are. *Velour: Velour is a fabric with cut loops. Velour bathrobes are typically made with terry inside, as terrycloth absorbs water better than velour. Velour gives the bathrobe luxury, cosiness, and makes the garment softer to the touch. *Waffle: Waffle fabric has good water absorbency, is loose and has a distinctive \\"gridlike\\" appearance. For the most part, these bathrobes are designed for their light weight.  Styles of collars  Woman's kimono-style dressing gown with a sash, made in Japan for the Western market, late 19th - early 20th century. There are varieties of collars for bathrobes: *Shawl collar: So called because the collar closes about the neck just like a shawl. The shawl collar is borrowed from its use on men's evening wear, the dinner jacket and smoking jacket, and is common on traditional dressing gowns. *Kimono: This is a traditional Japanese garment and the name literally translates to ‚Äòthing to wear‚Äô. The kimono style robe actually has no collar per se. *Hooded: A hood is sewn into the neckline, which can be worn over the head to keep it warm and help dry wet hair.  Styles of sculpture  The sculpture refers to the texture or styling of the bathrobe's fabric. The sculpture of a robe not only provides aesthetic appeal but also affects the absorbency and the hang of the item. The sculpture is a pattern sewn into the terry cloth, velour, or other fabric that reduces bulk, increases suppleness, and yields a more graceful hang on thicker styles. There are several varieties of fabric sculptures for robes: *Window Pane: A box or checkerboard pattern in various sizes *Zig Zag: A plush, repeating \\"Z\\" pattern *Ribbed: A sculpture design that yields alternating vertical lines of plush material and sewn material *Waves: Similar to the Zig Zag sculpture, but with gentler angles  Design  Each bathrobe has been differently designed with the collar and waist main features. Most robes are fitted with a belt that ties looped through the waist to fit all sizes. A popular style is a kimono relaxed collar, as is the shawl design too, but it all depends on how you like to be covered: *Long Bath: Terry bathrobe *Pure: Organic robe *Relaxed: Linen robe *Easy Care: Lightweight bamboo robe *Bamboo: Bamboo cotton fiber  See also  * Khalat * Toga * Banyan (clothing)  References   Further reading  * Category:Robes and cloaks ","title":"Bathrobe"},{"id":"1264653","text":"Gabo may refer to: * Gabo (character), character in role-playing game Dragon Warrior VII * Gabo Island, Victoria, Australia * Gabo Pat, neighbourhood in Karachi, Pakistan * Gabo Reform, series of reforms in Korea People * Nickname of Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez (1927‚Äì2014), Colombian novelist, journalist, editor, publisher, political activist, and recipient of the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature * Naum Gabo (1890-1977), prominent Russian sculptor in the Constructivism movement Similar spelling * Cabo (disambiguation) * Cabos, a gnutella filesharing client ","title":"Gabo"},{"id":"1264660","text":"Fairport's Cropredy Convention (formerly Cropredy Festival) is an annual festival of folk and rock music, headed by British folk-rock band Fairport Convention and held on the edge of the village of Cropredy in Oxfordshire, England. The festival has taken place in August annually since 1976. Fairport's Cropredy Convention attracts up to 20,000 people each year, making it the largest annual festival of its kind in Britain; and discounting Glastonbury, V Festival, Reading & Leeds Festivals and T in the Park, which all have had greater attendance but have all had non-continuous runs. The festival features a single stage at the lower end of the sloping arena field. There are also ancillary events, such as Morris dancing in the streets and live music at the village's two pubs. History The festival began as a private performance to about 750 people by the British folk rock band Fairport Convention in a village back garden in July 1976. The next year the performance was repeated and opened up to the public. In 1978 it was properly organised and moved to a larger site behind the Cropredy village school. It became a significant event in the band's history as they played their farewell performance there on 4 August 1979 to around 4,500 people, who were cheered by a promise to continue with annual reunions. From this point the festival became the main mechanism for preserving the identity of the band and for their many fans to show their appreciation.F. Redwood and M. Woodward, The Woodworm Era: The Story of Today‚Äôs Fairport Convention (Thatcham, Berks, UK: Jeneva Publishing, 1995), p. 76. The stage at Fairport's Cropredy Convention festival, Oxfordshire, in August 2009 At the first reunion in 1980 the festival was expanded from a one to a two-day event with increasing numbers of guest acts. In 1981, lacking a suitable site at Cropredy, it was shifted to the grounds of Broughton Castle, a performance released as Moat on the Ledge ‚Äì Live at Broughton Castle (1982). The festival returned to Cropredy the next year (and has remained there ever since although the actual site has expanded over the years). Despite the fact that Fairport Convention was not active as a band from 1980 to 1985, the festival continued to grow. After the band reformed in 1985, the festival became Fairport's major platform for showcasing new material as well as revisiting the old. Between 1981 and 1999, the festival was a two-day event. From 2000, it was expanded to three days‚ÄîThursday, Friday and Saturday. The festival takes place on the second full weekend in August. Originally known as just \\"the Cropredy reunion\\", the event was branded Cropredy Festival until 2005 when it was retitled Fairport's Cropredy Convention. In 2007, all available tickets were sold in advance for the first time (this would not happen again until 2014). In 2008, a live on- stage video screen was introduced. The year was also notable because, for the first time, not a single theft from the campsites was reported to festival control over the whole three days, underlining the unique and friendly atmosphere for which the festival is famous. In 2010, highlights of the festival were televised on Sky Arts for the first time, with a documentary presented by radio DJ and television presenter Bob Harris. This continued through to 2012. Since 2013 the Whispering Bob Broadcasting Company have been uploading highlights of the festival on their YouTube channel. =Outline of the festival= The event is organised largely by Gareth Williams, the Festival Director, and also Simon Nicol and Dave Pegg, both members of Fairport. Fairport themselves open the festival on the Thursday evening with an acoustic set, and close the festival on the Saturday night. The majority of attendees camp for the duration of the festival. There are eight separate camping fields adjacent to the arena, one of which is reserved for family parties. Fairport's Cropredy Convention is aimed at all ages with an emphasis on families and has developed a reputation as a particularly friendly and safe festival. As well as a wide range of live music, the event features three dozen stalls selling clothing, books, CDs and food. It also boasts a very large bar which specialises in cask ale which is provided by Wadworth, a brewery based in Devizes, Wiltshire. The bar is used by festival-goers and performers alike (there is no back-stage bar), making Cropredy one of the few major festivals where the public can mingle with the musicians playing there. In recent years, the running times for live music have been 4 p.m. until 11 p.m. on the Thursday and noon until midnight on the Friday and Saturday. Also recently, there has been a wider spread of genres of music, expanding out from the original folk roots of the festival. Status Quo, the Buzzcocks, Dreadzone and Supergrass have played at Cropredy in recent years. Among many well-known acts appearing in recent years are Robert Plant, Alice Cooper, Lonnie Donegan, Procol Harum, Steeleye Span, Eliza Carthy, Yusuf Islam and Oysterband (see below for others). =The pre-Cropredy \\"warm-ups\\"= On the Monday and Tuesday before the festival each year, fans get a foretaste of what is to come at the festival when Fairport Convention stage \\"warm-up\\" concerts at a local club venue. Until 2007 these concerts were held at the Mill Arts Centre in Banbury. From 2007 until 2010 the concerts were held at Woodford Halse Social Club (Woodford Halse is a village in Northamptonshire approximately nine miles northeast of Cropredy) but returned to The Mill in 2011. In 2017 the warm-ups moved from The Mill to Banbury Trades And Labour Club, following in the footsteps of P J Wright (fellow band-member with Dave Pegg in the Dylan Project) who had moved his annual TRADarrr pre-Cropredy Wednesday gig to the same venue in 2016.

It portrays the courtship of the beautiful American girl Daisy Miller by Winterbourne, a sophisticated compatriot of hers. His pursuit of her is hampered by her own flirtatiousness, which is frowned upon by the other expatriates when they meet in Switzerland and Italy. Plot summary Annie \\"Daisy\\" Miller and Frederick Winterbourne first meet in Vevey, Switzerland, in a garden of the grand hotel,James, Henry (2008). \\"Daisy Miller\\", p.5. Stilwell, KS. . where Winterbourne is allegedly vacationing from his studies (an attachment to an older lady is rumoured). They are introduced by Randolph Miller, Daisy's nine-year-old brother. Randolph considers their hometown of Schenectady, New York, to be absolutely superior to all of Europe. However, Daisy is absolutely delighted with the continent, especially the high society she wishes to enter. Winterbourne is at first confused by her attitude, and though greatly impressed by her beauty, he soon determines that she is nothing more than a young flirt. He continues his pursuit of Daisy in spite of the disapproval of his aunt, Mrs. Costello, who spurns any family with so close a relationship to their courier as the Millers have with their Eugenio. She also thinks Daisy is a shameless girl for agreeing to visit the Ch√¢teau de Chillon with Winterbourne after they have known each other for only half an hour. Two days later, the two travel to Ch√¢teau de Chillon and although Winterbourne had paid the janitor for privacy, Daisy is not quite impressed. Winterbourne then informs Daisy that he must go to Geneva the next day. Daisy feels disappointment and chaffs him, eventually asking him to visit her in Rome later that year. In Rome, Winterbourne and Daisy meet unexpectedly in the parlor of Mrs. Walker, an American expatriate, whose moral values have adapted to those of Italian society. Rumors about Daisy meeting with young Italian gentlemen make her socially exceptionable under these criteria. Winterbourne learns of Daisy's increasing intimacy with a young Italian of questionable society, Giovanelli, as well as the growing scandal caused by the pair's behaviour. Daisy is undeterred by the open disapproval of the other Americans in Rome, and her mother seems quite unaware of the underlying tensions. Winterbourne and Mrs. Walker attempt to persuade Daisy to separate from Giovanelli, but she refuses. One night, Winterbourne takes a walk through the Colosseum and sees a young couple sitting at its centre. He realises that they are Giovanelli and Daisy. Infuriated with Giovanelli, Winterbourne asks him how he could dare to take Daisy to a place where she runs the risk of catching \\"Roman Fever\\". Daisy says she does not care and Winterbourne leaves them. Daisy falls ill and dies a few days later. Key themes This novella serves as both a psychological description of the mind of a young woman and as an analysis of the traditional views of a society where she is a clear outsider. Henry James uses Daisy's story to discuss what he thinks Europeans and Americans believe about each other and more generally the prejudices common in any culture. In a letter, James said that Daisy is the victim of a \\"social rumpus\\" that goes on either over her head or beneath her notice.[https://haquelebac.wordpress.com/2011/08/16/why-did-henry-james-kill- daisy-miller/ James, Henry. Letter to Eliza Lynn Linton, cited by Philip Horne in Approaches to Teaching Henry James's Daisy Miller and The Turn of the Screw, ed. Kimberly C. Reed, Peter G. Beidler. New York: The Modern Language Association of America, 2005, p. 52. . James wrote, \\"Poor little D.M. was (as I understand her) in all things innocent... The whole idea of the story is the little tragedy of a light, thin, natural, unsuspecting creature being sacrificed, as it were, to a social rumpus that went on quite over her head & to which she stood in no measurable relation.\\" The names of the characters are also symbolic. Daisy is a flower in full bloom, without inhibitions and in the springtime of her life. Daisy contrasts sharply with Winterbourne. Flowers die in winter and this is precisely what happens to Daisy after catching the Roman Fever. As an objective analogue to this psychological reality, Daisy catches the very real Roman fever, the malaria that was endemic to many Roman neighbourhoods in the 19th century. The issue on which the novella turns is the \\"innocence\\" of Daisy, despite her seemingly scandalous behaviour. John Burnside, writing for The Independent, said, > Daisy Miller arrives in Frederick Winterbourne's staid world the way that an > angel arrives at an Annunciation, as both promise and challenge. From their > first meeting at Vevey, to the story's dramatic conclusion in Rome, > Winterbourne's interest in Daisy is subject to constant censure from his > carefully \\"exclusive\\" aunt, Mrs Costello, and her forensically respectable > social circle: the girl is \\"not nice\\", they say; she is overly familiar with > her family's courier, she has been observed in inappropriate situations with > dubious young \\"gentlemen\\" and Winterbourne would clearly do well to distance > himself, before the inevitable scandal unfolds.

Critical evaluation Daisy Miller was an immediate and widespread popular success for James, despite some criticism that the story was \\"an outrage on American girlhood\\". The story continues to be one of James' most popular works, along with The Turn of the Screw and The Portrait of a Lady. Critics have generally praised the freshness and vigor of the storytelling. In 1909, James revised Daisy Miller extensively for the New York Edition. He altered the tone of the story, and many modern editions (Penguin; Broadview) prefer to print the original edition, their editors believing that the later edition is a diminution of the original, rather than an improvement. Derivative works James converted his story into a play that failed to be produced. He published the play in The Atlantic Monthly in 1883, and it showed many changes from the original story. In particular, a happy ending was inserted to please what James believed to be the preferences of theatre-goers. In the 1890s, a short walking-skirt called the rainy daisy, supposedly named for Daisy Miller, was introduced. A 1974 film adaptation was directed by Peter Bogdanovich, with Cybill Shepherd as Daisy, Barry Brown as Frederick Winterbourne, Cloris Leachman as Mrs. Ezra Miller, Duilio Del Prete as Mr. Giovanelli, and Eileen Brennan as Mrs. Walker. Frederick Raphael wrote the script; the film follows the structure of the original story without significant changes, and even uses portions of James' dialogue from the novel. A rap adaptation of Daisy Miller appears on Heavy Jamal's album Shining Sky Lobster. The novella was adapted in 2017 as a five-part radio drama on BBC Radio 4 for its 15 Minute Dramas \\"Love Henry James\\" series.

Gameplay The game is broken into stages; each stage is a single boss battle, resulting in a constant stream of bosses. To progress to the next stage, the boss must be completely destroyed within the time limit. The game starts with a default time limit of 180 seconds, with 30 seconds rewarded for every boss defeated and 20 seconds lost for each time the player is destroyed. The player flies a relatively small green ship. There are no power-ups - the player's only weapon is a very rapid- fire revolving cannon which is fired by holding down the shoot button (Z key by default). By default, it fires straight ahead with a small spread. Alternatively, after the switch button (D key by default) is pressed, a green arc is displayed originating from the ship and widening as distance increases. This arc represents the spread of the weapon fire and does not change while the weapon is firing. It can, however, be modified based on the ship's motion while not firing. The arc will rotate slowly to face the direction opposite the ship's motion. Also, the arc will widen as the player moves toward the enemy and vice versa. The main gameplay feature is the bosses change from stage to stage. Based on how a boss is destroyed, the next boss will adapt itself to defend against previously used strategies and force the player to change tactics. For example, if the front section of one boss is destroyed the next boss will have increased armor in that area. If the player's ship is hit by a certain kind of weapon, but still defeats the boss, the next boss is likely to have more weapons of that type. The game does not include music, but provides instructions in the read me file on how to provide one's own music. It also includes sound effects. Reception Download.com awarded the game a 5-star editor's rating and described the game as a classic in the making, \\"Warning Forever will entice nearly every gamer who enjoys a space shootout\\". The staff of Computer Gaming World, writing for gaming blog 1up.com said \\"This game is among the most addictive platform shooters in the business\\".

This may occur as a primary process in normal tissue, or secondarily as malignant degeneration of a previously existing benign tumor. Causes There are many causes of primary malignant transformation, or tumorigenesis. Most human cancers in the United States are caused by external factors, and these factors are largely avoidable. These factors were summarized by Doll and Peto in 1981, and were still considered to be valid in 2015. These factors are listed in the table. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" + External factors in cancer ! Factor!!Estimated percent of cancer deaths - !Diet  35 - !Tobacco  30 - !Infection  10 - !Reproductive and sexual behaviora  7 - !Occupation  4 - !Alcohol  3 - !Sunlight (UV)  3 - !Pollution  2 - !Medicines and medical procedures  1 - !Food additives  <1 - !Industrial products  <1 } a Reproductive and sexual behaviors include: number of partners; age at first menstruation; zero versus one or more live births Examples of diet-related malignant transformation =Diet and colon cancer= Colon cancer provides one example of the mechanisms by which diet, the top factor listed in the table, is an external factor in cancer. The Western diet of African Americans in the United States is associated with a yearly colon cancer rate of 65 per 100,000 individuals, while the high fiber/low fat diet of rural Native Africans in South Africa is associated with a yearly colon cancer rate of <5 per 100,000. Feeding the Western diet for two weeks to Native Africans increased their secondary bile acids, including carcinogenic deoxycholic acid, by 400%, and also changed the colonic microbiota. Evidence reviewed by Sun and Kato indicates that differences in human colonic microbiota play an important role in the progression of colon cancer. =Diet and lung cancer= A second example, relating a dietary component to a cancer, is illustrated by lung cancer. Two large population-based studies were performed, one in Italy and one in the United States. In Italy, the study population consisted of two cohorts: the first, 1721 individuals diagnosed with lung cancer and no severe disease, and the second, 1918 control individuals with absence of lung cancer history or any advanced diseases. All individuals filled out a food frequency questionnaire including consumption of walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds, and peanuts, and indicating smoking status. In the United States, 495,785 members of AARP were questioned on consumption of peanuts, walnuts, seeds, or other nuts in addition to other foods and smoking status. In this U.S. study 18,533 incident lung cancer cases were identified during up to 16 years of follow-up. Overall, individuals in the highest quintile of frequency of nut consumption had a 26% lower risk of lung cancer in the Italian study and a 14% lower risk of lung cancer in the U.S. study. Similar results were obtained among individuals who were smokers. Due to tobacco The most important chemical compounds in smoked tobacco that are carcinogenic are those that produce DNA damage since such damage appears to be the primary underlying cause of cancer. Cunningham et al. combined the microgram weight of the compound in the smoke of one cigarette with the known genotoxic effect per microgram to identify the most carcinogenic compounds in cigarette smoke. These compounds and their genotoxic effects are listed in the article Cigarette. The top three compounds are acrolein, formaldehyde and acrylonitrile, all known carcinogens. Due to infection =Viruses= In 2002 the World Health Organizations International Agency for Research on Cancer estimated that 11.9% of human cancers are caused by one of seven viruses (see Oncovirus overview table). These are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV or HHV4); Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV or HHV8); Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C viruses (HBV and HCV); Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1 (HTLV-1); Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV); and a group of alpha Human papillomaviruses (HPVs). =Bacteria=  Helicobacter pylori and gastric cancer In 1995 epidemiologic evidence indicated that Helicobacter pylori infection increases the risk for gastric carcinoma. More recently, experimental evidence showed that infection with Helicobacter pylori cagA- positive bacterial strains results in severe degrees of inflammation and oxidative DNA damage, leading to progression to gastric cancer. Other bacterial roles in carcinogenesis Perera et al. referred to a number of articles pointing to roles of bacteria in other cancers. They pointed to single studies on the role of Chlamydia trachomatis in cervical cancer, Salmonella typhi in gallbladder cancer, and both Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium nucleatum in colon cancer. Meurman has recently summarized evidence connecting oral microbiota with carcinogenesis. Although suggestive, these studies need further confirmation. Common underlying factors in cancer =Mutations= One underlying commonality in cancers is genetic mutation, acquired either by inheritance, or, more commonly, by mutations in one's somatic DNA over time. The mutations considered important in cancers are those that alter protein coding genes (the exome). As Vogelstein et al. point out, a typical tumor contains two to eight exome \\"driver gene\\" mutations, and a larger number of exome mutations that are \\"passengers\\" that confer no selective growth advantage. Cancers also generally have genome instability, that includes a high frequency of mutations in the noncoding DNA that makes up about 98% of the human genome. The average number of DNA sequence mutations in the entire genome of breast cancer tissue is about 20,000. In an average melanom (where melanomas have a higher exome mutation frequency) the total number of DNA sequence mutations is about 80,000. =Epigenetic alterations= Transcription silencing A second underlying commonality in cancers is altered epigenetic regulation of transcription. In cancers, loss of gene expression occurs about 10 times more frequently by epigenetic transcription silencing (caused, for example, by promoter hypermethylation of CpG islands) than by mutations. As Vogelstein et al. point out, in a colorectal cancer there are usually about 3 to 6 driver mutations and 33 to 66 hitchhiker, or passenger, mutations. In contrast, the frequency of epigenetic alterations is much higher. In colon tumors compared to adjacent normal-appearing colonic mucosa, there are about 600 to 800 heavily methylated CpG islands in promoters of genes in the tumors while the corresponding CpG islands are not methylated in the adjacent mucosa. Such methylation turns off expression of a gene as completely as a mutation would. Around 60‚Äì70% of human genes have a CpG island in their promoter region. In colon cancers, in addition to hypermethylated genes, several hundred other genes have hypomethylated (under-methylated) promoters, thereby causing these genes to be turned on when they ordinarily would be turned off. Post-transcriptional silencing Epigenetic alterations are also carried out by another major regulatory element, that of microRNAs (miRNAs). In mammals, these small non-coding RNA molecules regulate about 60% of the transcriptional activity of protein-encoding genes. Epigenetic silencing or epigenetic over-expression of miRNA genes, caused by aberrant DNA methylation of the promoter regions controlling their expression, is a frequent event in cancer cells. Almost one third of miRNA promoters active in normal mammary cells were found to be hypermethylated in breast cancer cells, and that is a several fold greater proportion of promoters with altered methylation than is usually observed for protein coding genes. Other microRNA promoters are hypomethylated in breast cancers, and, as a result, these microRNAs are over-expressed. Several of these over-expressed microRNAs have a major influence in progression to breast cancer. BRCA1 is normally expressed in the cells of breast and other tissue, where it helps repair damaged DNA, or destroy cells if DNA cannot be repaired. BRCA1 is involved in the repair of chromosomal damage with an important role in the error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks. BRCA1 expression is reduced or undetectable in the majority of high grade, ductal breast cancers. Only about 3‚Äì8% of all women with breast cancer carry a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation was present in only 13% of unselected primary breast carcinomas. However, breast cancers were found to have an average of about 100-fold increase in miR-182, compared to normal breast tissue. In breast cancer cell lines, there is an inverse correlation of BRCA1 protein levels with miR-182 expression. Thus it appears that much of the reduction or absence of BRCA1 in high grade ductal breast cancers may be due to over-expressed miR-182. In addition to miR-182, a pair of almost identical microRNAs, miR-146a and miR-146b-5p, also repress BRCA1 expression. These two microRNAs are over-expressed in triple-negative tumors and their over-expression results in BRCA1 inactivation. Thus, miR-146a and/or miR-146b-5p may also contribute to reduced expression of BRCA1 in these triple-negative breast cancers. Post- transcriptional regulation by microRNA occurs either through translational silencing of the target mRNA or through degradation of the target mRNA, via complementary binding, mostly to specific sequences in the three prime untranslated region of the target gene's mRNA. The mechanism of translational silencing or degradation of target mRNA is implemented through the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). DNA repair gene silencing Silencing of a DNA repair gene by hypermethylation or other epigenetic alteration appears to be a frequent step in progression to cancer. As summarized in a review, promoter hypermethylation of DNA repair gene MGMT occurs in 93% of bladder cancers, 88% of stomach cancers, 74% of thyroid cancers, 40%-90% of colorectal cancers and 50% of brain cancers. In addition, promoter hypermethylation of DNA repair genes LIG4, NEIL1, ATM, MLH1 or FANCB occurs at frequencies between 33% to 82% in one or more of head and neck cancers, non-small-cell lung cancers or non- small-cell lung cancer squamous cell carcinomas. Further, the article Werner syndrome ATP-dependent helicase indicates the DNA repair gene WRN has a promoter that is often hypermethylated in a variety of cancers, with WRN hypermethylation occurring in 11% to 38% of colorectal, head and neck, stomach, prostate, breast, thyroid, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chondrosarcoma and osteosarcoma cancers. Such silencing likely acts similarly to a germ-line mutation in a DNA repair gene, and predisposes the cell and its descendants to progression to cancer. Another review points out that when a gene necessary for DNA repair is epigenetically silenced, DNA repair would tend to be deficient and DNA damages can accumulate. Increased DNA damage can cause increased errors during DNA synthesis, leading to mutations that give rise to cancer. Induced by heavy metals The heavy metals cadmium, arsenic and nickel are all carcinogenic when present above certain levels. Cadmium is known to be carcinogenic, possibly due to reduction of DNA repair. Lei et al. evaluated five DNA repair genes in rats after exposure of the rats to low levels of cadmium. They found that cadmium caused repression of three of the DNA repair genes: XRCC1 needed for base excision repair, OGG1 needed for base excision repair, and ERCC1 needed for nucleotide excision repair. Repression of these genes was not due to methylation of their promoters. Arsenic carcinogenicity was reviewed by Bhattacharjee et al. They summarized the role of arsenic and its metabolites in generating oxidative stress, resulting in DNA damage. In addition to causing DNA damage, arsenic also causes repression of several DNA repair enzymes in both the base excision repair pathway and the nucleotide excision repair pathway. Bhattacharjee et al. further reviewed the role of arsenic in causing telomere dysfunction, mitotic arrest, defective apoptosis, as well as altered promoter methylation and miRNA expression. Each of these alterations could contribute to arsenic-induced carcinogenesis. Nickel compounds are carcinogenic and occupational exposure to nickel is associated with an increased risk of lung and nasal cancers. Nickel compounds exhibit weak mutagenic activity, but they considerably alter the transcriptional landscape of the DNA of exposed individuals. Arita et al. examined the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of eight nickel-refinery workers and ten non-exposed workers. They found 2756 differentially expressed genes with 770 up-regulated genes and 1986 down-regulated genes. DNA repair genes were significantly over-represented among the differentially expressed genes, with 29 DNA repair genes repressed in the nickel-refinery workers and two over-expressed. The alterations in gene expression appear to be due to epigenetic alterations of histones, methylations of gene promoters, and hypermethylation of at least microRNA miR-152. Clinical signs Malignant transformation of cells in a benign tumor may be detected by pathologic examination of tissues. Often the clinical signs and symptoms are suggestive of a malignant tumor. The physician, during the medical history examination, can find that there have been changes in size or patient sensation and, upon direct examination, that there has been a change in the lesion itself. Risk assessments can be done and are known for certain types of benign tumor which are known to undergo malignant transformation. One of the better-known examples of this phenomenon is the progression of a nevus to melanoma.

Official description The national emblem of the Republic of China is officially described in the National Emblem and National Flag of the Republic of China Act:National Emblem and National Flag of the Republic of China Act, English History of the Blue Sky White Sun design The \\"Blue Sky with a White Sun\\" flag was originally designed by Lu Hao-tung, a martyr of the Republican revolution. He presented his design to represent the revolutionary army at the inauguration of the Society for Regenerating China, an anti-Qing society in Hong Kong, on February 21, 1895. During the Wuchang Uprising in 1911 that heralded the Republic of China, the various revolutionary armies had different flags. Lu Hao-tung's \\"Blue Sky with a White Sun\\" flag was used in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou, while the \\"18-Star Flag\\", \\"Five-Colored Flag\\", and other designs were used elsewhere. When the government of the Republic of China was established on January 1, 1912, The \\"Five-Colored\\" flag was adopted as the national flag, but Sun Yat-sen did not consider its design appropriate, reasoning that horizontal order implied a hierarchy or class like that which existed during dynastic times. Thus, when he established a rival government in Guangzhou in 1917, he brought over the \\"Blue Sky with a White Sun\\" flag for the party and the \\"Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth\\" () flag, which was then the naval ensign, for the nation. This officially became the national flag in 1928 while the \\"Blue Sky with a White Sun\\" flag was adopted as the naval jack. The \\"Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth\\" flag has remained the flag of the Republic of China to this day.  National emblem and history  Twelve Symbols national emblem, national emblem of the Republic of China (1913‚Äì1928) and the Empire of China (1915‚Äì1916). The national emblem of the Republic of China was derived from the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag. The emblem was designed by He Yingqin at Whampoa Military Academy in 1924 and was set as the national emblem by the Law of national flag and national emblem of the Republic of China in 1928. On the national emblem rays of sun have some distance to the edge, symbolizing the broadness of the sky, while on Kuomintang emblem the rays reach the edge, symbolizing the spirit of revolution is as powerful as the sun. The national emblem of the Republic of China from 1913 to 1928 is called Twelve Symbols national emblem, based on the traditional symbols on clothes of ancient Chinese emperors. It was designed by Lu Xun, Qian Daosun and Xu Shoushang on August 28, 1912 and was set as national emblem in February 1913. It remained as the national emblem during the Empire of China from 1915 to 1916. After the Northern Expedition it was replaced by the Blue Sky with a White Sun national emblem in 1928.  Situation during Dang Guo period  The KMT and ROC flags displayed at a party building in Kaohsiung. In the early years of the Republic, under the KMT's political tutelage, the Blue Sky with a White Sun Flag shared the same prominence as the ROC flag. A common wall display consisted of the KMT flag perched on the left and the ROC flag perched on the right, each tilted at an angle with a portrait of National Father Sun Yat-sen displayed in the center. After the promulgation of the Constitution of the Republic of China, the party flag was removed from such displayed and the national flag moved to the center. Since the ROC government moved to Taiwan and especially in the years since the end of martial law the KMT flag has lost some of its prominence. However, it is still frequently seen on KMT party buildings in political rallies and other meetings of KMT and the pan-blue coalition. The flag and the KMT party emblem made news during the ROC legislative elections of 2004, when President Chen Shui-bian suggested that the Kuomintang's flag and party emblem violated the ROC's National Emblem Law for being too similar to the national emblem of the Republic of China. Chen stated that the law forbids the ROC's emblem and flag from being used by non-governmental organizations and warned that the KMT would have three months to change its flag and emblem if his Democratic Progressive Party won a majority of seats in the legislature. The KMT responded by asking the government to change the national emblem, saying the KMT emblem existed first. However, the pan-green coalition failed to win a majority, and Chen took no action for the remainder of his presidency. Use in other countries The design of \\"Blue Sky with a White Sun\\" was used in the unit insignia or coats of arms of some units of the United States Army that fought in World War II. The most famous unit was Merrill's Marauders (officially named the \\"5307th Composite Unit (Provisional)\\"), which has the \\"Blue Sky with a White Sun\\" as part of its badge. The usage by American troops was a result of cooperation between US and Chinese Expeditionary Force in the China Burma India Theater. Postwar US military units stationed in Taiwan, including the United States Taiwan Defense Command (USTDC) and the Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG), also used the design in their badges. Up to now, the \\"Blue Sky with a White Sun\\" can still be seen in the emblem of the 75th Ranger Regiment.

","title":"1890 in rail transport"},{"id":"1264752","text":"Kenneth Lofton (born May 31, 1967) is a former Major League Baseball (MLB) center fielder. Lofton was a six-time All-Star (1994-1999), four-time Gold Glove Award winner (1993-1996), and at retirement, was ranked 15th among all- time stolen base leaders with 622. During his career, he played for the Houston Astros, Cleveland Indians (three different times), Atlanta Braves, Chicago White Sox, San Francisco Giants, Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago Cubs, New York Yankees, Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Texas Rangers. Lofton attended the University of Arizona on a basketball scholarship. The Wildcats made it to the Final Four in 1988. He did not join the school's baseball team until his junior year. Lofton made 11 postseason appearances, including World Series appearances in 1995 and 2002 with the Indians and Giants, respectively. From 2001 to 2007, Lofton did not spend more than one consecutive season with a team. For his career, the Indians were the only team he played with for longer than one season and the only franchise he played for more than once. Lofton played seasons with the Indians, helping the organization win six division titles. In 2010, he was inducted into the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame. During his professional baseball career, Lofton's single-season stolen base count led the American League (AL) on five occasions and all of Major League Baseball (MLB) three times. In 1994, he led the American League in hits. Lofton broke Rickey Henderson's record of 33 career postseason stolen bases during the 2007 postseason. Of his base running, Frank White said, \\"Lofton has out-thought a lot of major-league players\\" and later, \\"a smart, complete baseball player.\\" Early life Lofton was raised by his widowed grandmother, Rosie Persons, in \\"the slums\\" of East Chicago, Indiana. His mother, Annie, had Lofton while she was in high school and he weighed just at birth. His mother moved to Alabama after she graduated and lost contact with Lofton. Of his father, Lofton said, \\"We, as a family, don't even talk about it.\\" Persons had glaucoma and because of her failing eyesight was unemployed. She refused to go on welfare, but did collect Social Security as a result from her husband's death in 1960 (of bronchial pneumonia). When Lofton made the majors, he built a new home in East Chicago for his grandmother and other family members. Lofton attended Washington High School in East Chicago and played on the school's baseball team as a pitcher and center fielder. He was an all-state basketball player. He is the uncle of the actor Cirroc Lofton, who played Jake Sisko in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. College basketball and baseball Lofton as a member of the Arizona Wildcats men's basketball team, circa 1987 Lofton accepted a basketball scholarship to play at the University of Arizona. Wildcats head coach Lute Olson said of Lofton, \\"He's quick and a great leaper.\\" At one point, Lofton performed a 360¬∞ slam dunk for his unsuspecting teammates. For the Wildcats, Lofton was the backup point guard (to Craig McMillan and Steve Kerr) on a team that made it to the Final Four of the 1988 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. He was the starting point guard the following year when the Wildcats made it to the Sweet Sixteen. Lofton is one of only two men to play in a college basketball Final Four (1988) and an MLB World Series. (The other is fellow East Chicago Washington High School alumnus Tim Stoddard.) He left as the Wildcats' leader in career steals (a record eventually broken). \\"In strength and agility drills, he just killed it. He's a guy who could have played pro football or basketball or baseball\\", said former Wildcats teammate Bruce Fraser. Lofton decided to try out for the Wildcats baseball team during his junior year. He played in just five baseball games and recorded only one official at-bat while at Arizona, but his speed and potential were recognized by baseball scouts, including the Houston Astros' Clark Crist. The Astros later selected Lofton in the 17th round of the 1988 MLB draft. He played minor-league baseball during the summer while completing his basketball eligibility at Arizona. The Astros organization asked Lofton to play minor- league baseball in the Florida Instructional League, but Lofton declined, citing a promise he had made to his grandmother to obtain his degree. Lofton earned a degree in studio production at the University of Arizona while playing minor-league baseball for the Houston Astros. He credits his post-MLB success, as owner of FilmPool, Inc., to that education. Lofton is also a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. Minor league career right Lofton struggled early in his professional baseball career in the Astros farm system. He hit .214 in 48 games as an outfielder for the Auburn Astros of the New York‚ÄìPenn League, but recorded 26 stolen bases in 30 attempts. Lofton returned to Auburn in 1989 and hit .263 with 26 steals in 34 games. He then hit .329 with 14 steals in 22 games for the Asheville Tourists in the South Atlantic League. As his college basketball career came to an end, Lofton was able to concentrate on baseball and he improved rapidly, finishing second in the league in hitting at .331 while adding 62 steals for the Osceola Astros in the Florida State League. He also drew 61 walks and improved defensively (.974 fielding percentage) and played in 123 games with Osceola. After spring training in 1991, he went directly to the Triple-A Tucson Toros of the Pacific Coast League. His 168 hits led the league. He hit .308 with 30 steals and 52 walks for Tucson with 19 doubles and a team-high 17 triples. The Toros won the PCL championship and Lofton made the league's All-Star team. On September 14, 1991, the Astros promoted Lofton to the majors. Major league career =MLB season debut= In his major league debut with the Houston Astros on September 14, 1991, he went 3-for-4 with a double and scored three runs against the Cincinnati Reds. He hit .203 in 20 games for the remainder of the Astros' regular season. With Steve Finley already entrenched as Houston's centerfielder, and aged 26 years, Lofton was traded during the off season to the Cleveland Indians for catcher Eddie Taubensee and right-handed pitcher Willie Blair. \\"I know they gave up on me and now I'm glad they did. One man's trash is another man's treasure\\", Lofton said of the Astros trading him. =Cleveland Indians= Lofton with the Indians in 1996 During his first season with Cleveland, in 1992, Lofton hit .285. His 66 stolen bases broke the all-time record for an AL rookie and was the most by an MLB rookie since Vince Coleman stole 110 in 1985. His season's stolen-base count, which led the AL, also broke a franchise record (previously set by Miguel Dilon√© in 1980). Indians first base coach Dave Nelson helped Lofton refine his baserunning technique and helped him learn how to be successful with bunting. Lofton finished second (to the Milwaukee Brewers' Pat Listach) in AL Rookie of the Year balloting. After one season with Cleveland, Lofton agreed to a four-year, $6.3 million contract. The following season, Lofton broke his own Cleveland single-season stolen bases record, recording 70 (which led the MLB). Lofton was selected to his first career All-Star Game during the 1994 season. His development and impact in the league led Brewers manager Phil Garner to say, \\"I remember how raw he was, and I've never seen anybody develop into that type of player that fast.\\" Garner, who saw Lofton play in the minors, added, \\"He went from a guy who could hardly get the ball past the infield to a guy who could hit the ball consistently. He always had good speed, but got lousy jumps and didn't run the bases well. He has turned into a dominant player.\\" The regular season was stopped abruptly with the MLB strike, which also led to the cancellation of the World Series. For the season, Lofton again led the AL with 60 stolen bases. His 160 hits on the season were highest in the AL and his .349 batting average was a career-best. He finished fourth in Most Valuable Player Award voting. When the strike began in August, the Indians were in second place by one game in the AL Central to the Chicago White Sox. Indians general manager John Hart said of Lofton, \\"What a representative for our team and our city. He has the opportunity to be a George Brett-type player here, someone who is synonymous with a franchise.\\" Lofton joined fellow Indians Carlos Baerga, Albert Belle, and Jim Thome to form \\"the backbone of some Indians teams that were as dominant as any.\\" In 1995, Lofton was one of six Indians starters who batted .300 or higher (.310). He also had an MLB-best 13 triples. His 54 stolen bases led the AL for the third consecutive season. The Indians faced the Seattle Mariners in the 1995 ALCS. In the eighth inning of game six, Lofton had an infield bunt, stole second base, and scored from second on a passed ball between pitcher Randy Johnson and catcher Dan Wilson. The Indians won the game 4-0. It was described by The New York Times as \\"the run that demoralized the Mariners.\\" Fifteen years after Lofton's crossing of home plate, the Plain Dealer recalled: \\"Of all the electrifying moments on the Kenny Lofton highlight reel, none captures the essence of the player any better than his 180-foot dash to glory on October 17, 1995.\\" As a result of winning the game, the Indians had won the ALCS and in so doing, Lofton and the Indians had brought the AL pennant to Cleveland for the first time since the 1954 season. \\"I'm glad for the city of Cleveland to be able to experience this, because they haven't experienced this for a long time. The city of Cleveland has grown a lot, and it's improving, and we tried to do this for the city\\", Lofton said. The Indians lost the World Series to the Braves in six games despite finishing the regular season with a major league-best 100-44 record in the strike-shortened year. Lofton finished with a .200 batting average and six stolen bases in his first World Series appearance. In 2010, a few years into his retirement, Lofton stated he felt it was the toughest postseason loss of his 11 career playoff appearances, namely because he felt the umpires had favorable strike zones for Braves pitchers Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux. The following season in 1996, the Indians again had the best record in baseball (99-62) and Lofton's stolen base total (75) led the MLB for the second time in four years. He hit .317 and had a career-high 67 RBIs. The Indians lost in the 1996 ALDS to the Baltimore Orioles in four games. As an impending free agent, it was Lofton's last season with Cleveland before being traded near the end of spring training 1997 to the Atlanta Braves of the National League (NL). On trading Lofton, Hart said, \\"We had to make this trade based on the fact that Lofton could be a free agent at the end of this season. We went through it with Albert Belle last year, and Albert left and we had nothing in return. We were not prepared to do that again.\\" Lofton, described as \\"an emotional and offensive catalyst\\" with the Indians, appeared in three consecutive All-Star games (1994-1996) and won four straight Gold Glove Awards (1993-1996) with the Indians. He led the AL in stolen bases for five straight seasons (1992-1996) and set the single-season Indians' franchise stolen base record (75). =Atlanta Braves= The Atlanta Braves' Marquis Grissom and slugger David Justice were part of a Braves roster that, heading into the 1997 season, was the MLB's highest-paid. Grissom ($4.8 million annual salary) and Justice ($6 million) were traded to the Indians in return for Lofton ($4.75 million) and Alan Embree ($206,000). \\"This is a trade of enormous magnitude for two very, very good franchises. We're talking about franchise-type players\\", Hart said. For Lofton, considered \\"the centerpiece of the Indians' 1990s revival\\", it was a return to the National League. \\"The trade will be in the back of my mind for a long time, but it's baseball. It happens to nearly everybody. I'm [in Atlanta] to play every day. It's all Braves from now on\\", Lofton said. By April 19, the Braves were 13-3 and Lofton's hitting (.453 batting average) had won favor with his new Braves teammates. \\"If he keeps hitting .400 he'll fit in just fine\\", said Chipper Jones. For the season, Lofton's .333 batting average and 27 stolen bases were team highs (his stolen- base total was to that point a career low). He was caught stealing 20 times, an MLB high. Atlanta won the NL East division with an MLB-best 101-61 record. The Braves swept the Houston Astros in the 1997 National League Division Series (NLDS), three games to none. In the 1997 National League Championship Series (NLCS), the Braves lost to the Florida Marlins, four games to two (the Marlins later defeated the Cleveland Indians in the World Series). For the NLCS, Lofton batted .185 and was one of three Braves' hitters who recorded seven strikeouts in the series. For Lofton, who was eligible for free agency at the end of the season, it was his only season with the Braves. =Return to Cleveland= Lofton, who was considered the \\"most sought-after free agent\\" following the 1997 season, returned to the AL and Cleveland Indians when he signed a three-year, $24 million contract. Happy to return to Cleveland, Lofton said, \\"It's like I was a ghost for a year. But now I'm back.\\" Lofton's .282 batting average was to that point the lowest of his MLB career, but his 87 walks were a career high. However, he had 64 RBIs, his second-highest RBI total, which had been 66 at that point in his career and doubled his stolen base count with 54 from the previous year's total of 27. The Indians won the AL Central with an 89-73 record and their match-up against the Boston Red Sox, three games to one, in the 1998 ALDS. In the series against the Red Sox, Lofton's .375 batting average led the Indians, as did his two stolen bases and six hits. The Indians lost the 1998 ALCS in six games to the New York Yankees, who had won 114 games in the regular season. Lofton tied for third-most number of hits and strikeouts and his 27 at-bats led the Indians. For the 1999 season, Lofton finished with a .301 batting average, the seventh time in eight MLB seasons hitting .300 or better. It was, however, the first season with Cleveland he did not record 50 or more stolen bases, finishing the season with 25. The AL Central-winning Indians (97-65) lost in the 1999 ALDS to the Boston Red Sox, three games to two. The Indians had led in the series two games to none before losing three games in a row and the series. Lofton and Roberto Alomar each had two stolen bases in the series, but Lofton recorded just two hits in 16 at-bats. In Game 5, Lofton dislocated his left shoulder and tore his rotator cuff while diving into first base. On September 3, 2000, in a 12-11 win over the Baltimore Orioles, Lofton tied an MLB record previously held by Red Rolfe when he scored in 18 consecutive games. He tied an Indians' franchise single-game record with five stolen bases and won the game with a 13th-inning walk-off home run. He finished the 2000 season batting .278, recording 30 stolen bases and 107 runs (the sixth time crossing home plate 100 times or more in nine seasons). The Indians finished the regular season 90-72 and one game out of the wild card. After missing the postseason in 2000, the Indians returned in 2001 after winning the AL Central with a 91-71 regular- season record. Before winning the division, however, Lofton scored the game- winning run during an August 5 game against the Seattle Mariners; the Indians were down by 12 runs, and became just the third team in MLB history to overcome such a deficit, winning 15-14 in 11 innings. Indians catcher Eddie Taubensee, who was involved in the trade which sent Lofton from Houston to Cleveland at the beginning of his MLB career, caught Lofton after he slid into home plate and jumped with excitement after discovering he had just scored the game-winning run. \\"I caught him and wasn't going to let him go\\", Taubensee said. Cleveland won that game against Seattle, but lost their match-up with the 116-win Mariners in the 2001 ALDS. He hit 66 RBIs on the regular season (second-most in his career), but failed to record 20 stolen bases for the first time in his major-league career and batted a career-low .261. Lofton had been treated for a rib cage problem that had affected his play before the All- Star break. His second stint with Cleveland lasted through 2001, in which his salary was for $8 million in his final contract year with the club. He became a free agent at the conclusion of the season. =World Series ring pursuit= A free agent in 2002, Lofton signed a one-year, $1.025 million contract with the Chicago White Sox. \\"I looked at the different opportunities that I had and this was a team that won 83 games last year while they were banged up. Cleveland lost four good players from last year's team, and that's going to be hard to replace. This was an easy decision\\", Lofton said on signing with the White Sox. White Sox general manager Kenny Williams had stated when Lofton was healthy, like he was during the second half of the 2001 season, Chicago had obtained one of the best leadoff hitters in the game. When the White Sox were paired against the Indians in April during a three-game series at Chicago, the Indians were on a 10-game winning streak and at 11-1, had the best record in the majors. The White Sox ended the streak and for the series, Lofton was 6-for-14 with six runs scored. \\"You can't say enough about him, his effort, his intensity. He's been simply amazing\\", said White Sox manager Jerry Manuel. Lofton appeared in 93 games with the White Sox and hit .259 with 42 RBIs and 22 stolen bases. On July 28, he was traded to the San Francisco Giants of the NL for minor leaguers Ryan Meaux and F√©lix D√≠az. In the Giants' match-up with the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2002 NLCS, Lofton delivered a key hit to help the Giants win their first pennant since 1989. In the ninth inning, Cardinals manager Tony La Russa summoned left-handed reliever Steve Kline to face Lofton, who had already notched two singles in the game. Giants manager Dusty Baker considered bringing a right-handed hitter to pinch-hit for Lofton, but decided against doing so on the advice of his 3-year-old son. Lofton hit a first-pitch single to the outfield, scoring David Bell from second base and creating a 2-1 Giants victory. After the game, Baker remarked, \\"I just knew Kenny was focused and I know you can't keep Kenny down for too long. That's why we got Kenny over here. He's a big-game player and he's been great in the playoffs.\\" The Giants held a five-run lead in the seventh inning of game six of the World Series against the Anaheim Angels, but eight outs away from winning the World Series, the Angels rallied to win 6-5\\\\. The Angels took game seven the following night, with Lofton flying out to Darin Erstad in center to end that game and the World Series, and for the second time in his career, Lofton had lost a World Series. The Pittsburgh Pirates signed Lofton to a one- year, $1.025 million contract to begin the 2003 season. With the Pirates, he hit .277 and stole 18 bases in 84 games before being traded to the Chicago Cubs, where he was reunited with manager Dusty Baker. When Lofton joined the Cubs in July, he was joining a team that just one season before had lost 95 games. \\"With Kenny Lofton, we got a quality lead-off man\\", said Cubs general manager Jim Hendry. In 56 regular-season appearances with the Cubs, Lofton stole 12 bases and hit .327. Lofton and the Cubs won the NL Central division (88-74). The Cubs' postseason berth was just the sixth time since the divisional series format was introduced (1969) that a team made the postseason after having lost 95 games or more the previous season. Chicago beat the Atlanta Braves three games to two in the 2003 NLDS. Lofton hit .286 in the series and led the Cubs with three stolen bases and 21 at-bats. The Cubs, who were up in the series three games to one, held a three-run lead in the eighth inning of game six of the 2003 NLCS. The Florida Marlins scored eight unanswered runs, all in the eighth inning, to win game six and won game seven the following night to eliminate the Cubs. Lofton's .323 against the Marlins led the Cubs' starting line-up, as did his 31 at-bats, and he had the team's only stolen base of the seven-game series. Lofton was again on the move when on December 23, 2003, the New York Yankees signed him to a two-year, $6.2 million contract. During a Yankees' road game at Cleveland, Lofton recorded his 2,000th career hit. After Lofton's single, Indians fans began an ovation in honor of Lofton. \\"I didn't know what to expect. I figured I'd get a few claps. It was touching. I tipped my hat, but they just kept going. If there was a storybook way for me to get it, to get it in Cleveland, it was something to remember.\\" New York finished the regular season with an AL-best record, 101-61. To begin the postseason, the Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins, three games to one, in the 2004 ALDS. In the 2004 ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, the Yankees had built a 2-0 series lead when Lofton stated, \\"My ultimate goal is for me to try to win a championship. I'm at a point in my career - I've been here for 13 years, and gotten close. This is an opportunity for me to have a chance at it again.\\" Then Yankees went up in the series three games to none before becoming the first team in MLB history to lose a series after holding a 3-0 series lead. Lofton, who appeared in 83 games with the Yankees, felt manager Joe Torre did not use his skills appropriately. Lofton finished the regular season with a .275 batting average and a career-low seven stolen bases. With the Yankees looking to reshape their roster and the Philadelphia Phillies looking for a player with postseason experience, Lofton was dealt on December 3, 2004, which as part of the deal also had the Yankees sending $1.525 million to Philadelphia and the Phillies giving up reliever Felix Rodr√≠guez. After the trade, Lofton stated, \\"It's been very tough. I'm the kind of guy who likes to be settled down. It's been very tough the last three or four years. Everyone in New York understood I wanted to play. I just wanted an opportunity to perform and be a part of the team. I didn't feel as much of a part of the team.\\" With the Phillies, Lofton hit .335 in 110 appearances, his batting average a team high. He also recorded 22 stolen bases. The Phillies finished 88-74, two games from the NL East division winners and one game out of the wild card. Toward the end of his career, Lofton was featured in a DHL Express TV commercial, where the international shipper comically portrayed Lofton's frequent city changes and subsequent moves. Lofton in 2007 On December 12, 2006, the Texas Rangers signed Lofton to a one-year contract. By signing with the Rangers, Lofton tied Todd Zeile for most teams played for by a position player. In 84 games with the Rangers, he hit .303 with 16 doubles. On July 27, 2007, Lofton was traded by the Rangers to the Indians in exchange for minor-league catcher Max Ram√≠rez. \\"That's my biggest thing right now. I'm trying to get a World Series ring\\", Lofton said on joining the Indians for the third time in his career. The Jacobs Field crowd greeted Lofton with a standing ovation during his first at-bat for this tour of duty with the Indians. Lofton noted, \\"I missed being in Cleveland... I enjoy Cleveland. It's the city that got me going.\\" In game one of the 2007 ALDS against the Yankees, he went 3-for-4 with four RBIs and one stolen base, which tied him with Rickey Henderson for the MLB's all-time postseason stolen bases record (33). In game two, he went 2-for-3 with two walks and scored the winning run in the 11th inning. Then, in Game Three of the 2007 ALCS, the 40-year-old Lofton hit a two-run home run against the Boston Red Sox' Daisuke Matsuzaka, becoming the seventh-oldest player to hit a postseason home run. Lofton earned his 34th career postseason stolen base in game four of the 2007 ALCS, setting a new MLB record for playoff steals. The Indians, who at one point had a 3-1 game lead over the Red Sox, eventually lost the series. In game seven, Lofton was called out while attempting to steal second base, but the replay showed that he was safe. He was also held up at third base while attempting to tie the game, in a call that was criticized by Cleveland fans for years. Lofton became a free agent at the end of the season, but did not sign a contract with an MLB team. He expressed interest in playing before the 2009 season. From 2002 to 2007, Lofton played for eight teams and made it to the postseason with four of them. Joe Torre said, after Lofton had been to the playoffs in 11 of the past 13 seasons and played for 11 clubs in his career, \\"He bounced around a lot of clubs for a reason: They felt he could help them. He did a hell of a job.\\" As Rollie Fingers wrote, \\"On one hand, Lofton could be seen as a catalyst who magically sparked his teams into playoff contention, but others could say that it was simply a case of top playoff contenders repeatedly seeing him as the final piece of their puzzle.\\" =Retirement and Indians Hall of Fame= His 622 stolen bases rank him 15th all-time. He holds the Indians' record for stolen bases with 452. Lofton had tallied a .299 career batting average with 130 home runs, 116 triples, and 1,528 runs in 2,103 games. He was also a three-time MLB Player of the Week. Lofton played in 95 postseason games. In the playoffs for his career, he hit .247 with seven home runs and 34 RBI. Baseball historian Bill James named Lofton the \\"fastest player\\" and \\"best bunter\\" of the 1990s. On January 27, 2010, Lofton was announced as being selected as a member of the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame. He was inducted on August 7. Lofton was eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2013 and some have written his career numbers \\"will likely put him in the conversation of being Hall of Fame worthy.\\" He did not receive the necessary number of votes to remain on the ballot for 2014 and beyond. In 2015, Pedro Mart√≠nez, one of the most dominant pitchers of Lofton's era, named Lofton as among the most difficult hitters to pitch against in his career. Postplaying career Lofton has his own television production company, FilmPool, Inc. In 1997, he appeared as a guest star on The Wayans Bros., and in 2004, he appeared as a guest star on George Lopez. Lofton co-wrote the song \\"What If\\" on Ruben Studdard's 2006 album Soulful.http://wapc.mlb.com/cutfour/2014/07/21/85555526/kenny-lofton-wrote-a- song-on-ruben-studdards-no-1-album-soulful In 2008, Lofton qualified for the American Century Celebrity Golf Classic. He played golf in the off season during his playing days. For the 2011 spring-training season, Lofton was hired by the Indians to coach baserunning and outfield work. He also served as a commentator on the Fox Sports West postgame show for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Lofton considers himself a perfectionist. \\"I love cleaning. I clean up, wash dishes, and make a good bed. I'm pretty neat. I'm a perfectionist.

The Shadoks were bird-like in appearance (in the tradition of cartoon birds they had beaks with teeth), were characterised by ruthlessness and stupidity and inhabited a two dimensional planet. This planet was of irregular shape, which was continuously changing - causing major earthquakes - hence their desire to find a new home world. There was a series of caves on the Shadok planet, known as the \\"Gulp\\" which was essentially a prison for undesirables. One Shadok who stood apart from the others was the pirate - who was habitually drunk - and instead of the popular hobby of putting ships into bottles - he liked to put bottles into his ship. Another set of creatures in the Shadok canon are the Gibis, who are the opposite to the Shadoks in that they are intelligent but vulnerable and also inhabit a two-dimensional planet. The Gibis were polite, always greeted each other formally, and kept their brains inside their bowler hats. The Gibi planet was a flat disc, finely balanced that if one Gibi went to one end of the planet; another would have to go to the far end to keep the planet balanced. Thus, the Gibis also wanted to find a new home world. Ultimately, both saw the Earth as their ideal home - and both began to construct rockets to reach it The Shadoks were eventually able to leave their world thanks to the improved intelligence of one of their number; who happened to find a hat which one of the Gibis had lost. Once both races reached Earth, much mayhem followed and they eventually realised it was not the ideal home they first thought. Rouxel claims that the term Shadok obtains some derivation from Captain Haddock of Herg√©'s The Adventures of Tintin and the Gibis (who wear Bowler hats, which unlike their heads, contain their brains) are essentially GBs (Great Britons). The Shadoks were a significant literary, cultural and philosophical phenomenon in France. Even today, the French occasionally use satirical comparisons with the Shadoks for policies and attitudes that they consider absurd. The Shadoks were noted for mottos such as: * \\"Why do it the easy way when you can do it the hard way?\\" * \\"When one tries continuously, one ends up succeeding. Thus, the more one fails, the greater the chance that it will work.\\" * \\"If there is no solution, it is because there is no problem.\\" * \\"To reduce the numbers of unhappy people, always beat up the same individuals.\\" * \\"Every advantage has its disadvantages and vice versa.\\" * \\"If there is one chance out of a 1000 to succeed, rush failing the 999 first tries.\\" The Shadoks had five monosyllabic words in their language: \\"Ga\\", \\"Bu\\", \\"Zo\\", \\"Meu\\" and \\"Ni\\" (French spelling). But their brain had only four cells. So they could only remember the last four ones heard. The Shadoks were also noted for their seemingly useless and endless pumping -- as the Shadok say: \\"Better to pump even if nothing happens than to risk something worse happening by not pumping\\" and \\"When the Shadoks pumped, nothing happened; and the more they pumped, the more nothing happened.\\" In 1973, The Shadoks appeared on Thames Television, London's ITV company, in the early evening. Kenneth Robinson provided the narration in English. His narration to The Shadoks is very fondly remembered by those who heard it.

It was published by ‚Äì if not indeed written for ‚Äì his friend Franz Anton Hoffmeister. Because of this, the quartet has acquired the nickname Hoffmeister. Hoffmeister had started issuing a series of chamber-music publications in 1785, including Mozart's K. 499 as well as Joseph Haydn's Op. 42. Structure There are four movements: This work, sandwiched between the six quartets he dedicated to Joseph Haydn (1782-5) and the following three Prussian Quartets (1789-90), intended to be dedicated to King Frederick William II of Prussia , is often polyphonic in a way uncharacteristic of the earlier part of the classical music era.

The town lies on the left bank of the lower Hron river. The Old Slavic name of the town was Leva, which means \\"the Left One\\". The town is located in the north-eastern corner of the Danubian Lowland (Podunajsk√° n√≠≈æina), east of Bratislava, south-east of Nitra, south-west of Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica, south-west of Zvolen and from the border with Hungary. It is the capital of the Levice District, which is the largest district in Slovakia at . The town's heraldic animal is lion (in Slovak lev), and the town's colours are green and yellow. History Levice Castle Levice is first mentioned as Leua, one of the villages belonging to the parish of St. Martin's Church in Bratka () in 1156. It was part of the comitatus Tekov (Bars). First attacked by the Turks in 1544, the town was set on fire while the castle was left unharmed. Between 1581 and 1589, the settlement was the seat of the Captaincy of Lower Hungary. The town was held by the Turks for two decades from 1663 to 1685. Under the Ottoman administration Leva was the center of a sandjak, which was part of the Uyvar eyalet. Ottoman rule came to an end in the summer of 1685, when the Austrian Imperial Army led by General de Souches claimed an important victory at the Battle of Levice, which took place beneath the town's castle. Austrian map, 1672 During the anti-Habsburg revolution of 1709, the fort was blown up by kuruces. After the break-up of Austria-Hungary, the town became a part of Czechoslovakia (confirmed by the Treaty of Trianon in 1920). As part of the breakup of Czechoslovakia under the Munich Agreement in World War II, the town again belonged to Hungary from 1938 to 1945. At the end of the Second World War it was returned to the restored Czechoslovakia. In 1993 it became part of present-day Slovakia. It was the hometown of Hungarian-American Eugene Fodor (1905‚Äì1991), the founder of Fodor's travel book company.

Early life and career Calvo- Sotelo was born into a prominent political family in Madrid on 14 April 1926 with his father, Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo,Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo y Bustelo, 1. marqu√©s de R√≠a de Ribadeo GeneAll and his mother, Mercedes Bustelo M√°rquez. The assassination of his uncle, Jos√© Calvo Sotelo, who had been finance minister under Miguel Primo de Rivera, was a key event leading up to the Spanish Civil War. Calvo-Sotelo graduated as a civil engineer from the School of Civil Engineers of Madrid now part of the Technical University of Madrid, working in the area of applications of chemistry to the industry. He was the president of RENFE (the Spanish national railroad network) between 1967 and 1968. Calvo-Sotelo was elected solicitor (Deputy) of Franco's Cortes, representing industrialists in the Union of Chemical Industries, in 1971. A monarchist, Sotelo was one of the founders of an association of politicians, mostly of Rightists and Center Rightists, which disguised as the Fedisa publishing firm helped Spain's peaceful transition into democracy. Political career Calvo-Sotelo was designated Minister of Commerce by Carlos Arias Navarro to be in the first government of the Monarchy (December 1975 ‚Äì July 1976). He advocated total destruction of Franco's ideals instead of mere superficial changes that politicians like Navarro planned. Calvo-Sotelo was kept in the cabinet of Adolfo Su√°rez upon his succession to premiership in 1976 and directed several centre-right and centre-left political associations into one party, the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD). The UCD won in both the June 1977 and the March 1979 elections and Calvo-Sotelo was elected MP for Madrid. President of the Government of Spain Su√°rez decided to keep him in the Cabinet, first from 1978 to 1980 as Minister for Relations of the European Economic Community, then as Second Vicepresident in charge of economic affairs. After the resignation of Su√°rez on 29 January 1981, he was supposed to be appointed Prime Minister () on 23 February, and advocated Spain's proposed entry into NATO as soon as possible. However, on that date a session of the Congress of Deputies was interrupted by the attempted coup of 23-F. After the failed coup, his appointment as Prime Minister was confirmed on 25 February by the vote of all the UCD members of the congress and 21 others as well, giving him a majority of 186 to 158. Splits in the UCD group led to the formation of three rival parties, the Democratic Action Party (Partido de Acci√≥n Democr√°tica/PAD), which soon merged with the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), the Democratic and Social Centre (CDS) and Democratic Popular Party (PDP), resulting in the UCD being unable to count on sufficient support in the legislature. Fresh elections were called, resulting in a heavy defeat for the UCD, which won only 12 seats at the 1982 election compared to 168 in 1979. He served as Prime Minister until 1 December 1982 and was succeeded by the socialist Felipe Gonz√°lez. Later years In 2002, Calvo-Sotelo was raised into the Spanish nobility by King Juan Carlos of Spain and given the hereditary title of Marqu√©s de la R√≠a de Ribadeo (Marquess of R√≠a de Ribadeo), together with the dignity Grande de Espa√±a (English: Grandee of Spain), this in honour for his service. Calvo-Sotelo was also a member of the Club of Madrid and of the Spanish Royal Academy of Engineering. He died of natural causes at his home in Pozuelo de Alarc√≥n, on 3 May 2008 aged 82. Personal life He was married to Mar√≠a del Pilar Ib√°√±ez-Mart√≠n y Mellado and had eight children: * Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo e Ib√°√±ez-Mart√≠n (b.

The current exhibition officially opened in January 2016. Contents were developed by CERN in collaboration with Spanish design team Indissoluble.  History  The project was approved by the CERN Directorate in February 1988. The initial construction, to a large extent completed in 1989, was financed through contributions from the Canton of Geneva, the Swiss Confederation, neighbouring France, banks and industrial firms. CMS life-size model  Main Exhibits  The exhibition displays many real objects, taking visitors on a journey through CERN's key installations, from the Hydrogen bottle, source of the protons that are injected into the LHC, through the first step in the accelerator chain, the Linac, on to a model of a section of the Large Hadron Collider including elements from the superconducting magnets. Visitors can interact with the displays to try their hand at the controls of a particle accelerator ‚Äì simulating the acceleration of protons in the LHC and bringing them into collision inside the experiments. The exhibition continues with a 1 :1 scale model of a complete slice through the CMS experiment at the LHC. The computing section displays some of the Oracle data tapes used to store the 30-40 petabytes of data produced yearly by the experiments, made available for analysis using the LHC Computing GRID. The annex to the exhibition contains other historical artifacts such as the central tracker from the UA1 detector, which ran at the Super Proton Synchrotron at CERN from 1981 to 1984, and helped discover the W and Z bosons.  Special Projects  A project began in 2013 to preserve the original hardware and software associated with the birth of the World Wide Web. Some of the original code resides on Tim Berners-Lee's NeXT Computer in the CERN museum and has not been recovered due to the computer's status as a historical artifact. This effort coincided with the 20th anniversary of the research center giving the web to the world.

(Latin: The Harmony of the World, 1619) is a book by Johannes Kepler. In the work, written entirely in Latin, Kepler discusses harmony and congruence in geometrical forms and physical phenomena. The final section of the work relates his discovery of the so-called \\"third law of planetary motion\\".Johannes Kepler, Harmonices Mundi [The Harmony of the World] (Linz, (Austria): Johann Planck, 1619), p. 189. From the bottom of p. 189: \\"Sed res est certissima extactissimaque quod proportio qua est inter binorum quorumcunque Planetarum tempora periodica, sit pr√¶cise sesquialtera proportionis mediarum distantiarum, id est Orbium ipsorum; ...\\" (But it is absolutely certain and exact that the proportion between the periodic times of any two planets is precisely the sesquialternate proportion [i.e., the ratio of 3:2] of their mean distances, that is, of the actual spheres, ...\\" An English translation of Kepler's Harmonices Mundi is available as: Johannes Kepler with E. J. Aiton, A. M. Duncan, and J. V. Field, trans., The Harmony of the World (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: American Philosophical Society, 1997); see especially p. 411. Background and history Kepler began working on Harmonices Mundi sometime near 1599, which was the year Kepler sent a letter to Michael Maestlin detailing the mathematical data and proofs that he intended to use for his upcoming text, which he originally planned to name De harmonia mundi. Kepler was aware that the content of Harmonices Mundi closely resembled that of the subject matter for Ptolemy's Harmonica, but was not concerned. The new astronomy Kepler would use-most notably the adoption of elliptic orbits in the Copernican system-allowed him to explore new theorems. Another important development that allowed Kepler to establish his celestial- harmonic relationships, was the abandonment of the Pythagorean tuning as the basis for musical consonance and the adoption of geometrically supported musical ratios; this would eventually be what allowed Kepler to relate musical consonance and the angular velocities of the planets. Thus, Kepler could reason that his relationships gave evidence for God acting as a grand geometer, rather than a Pythagorean numerologist.Field, J. V. (1984). A Lutheran astrologer: Johannes Kepler. Archive for History of Exact Sciences, Vol. 31, No. 3, pp. 207‚Äì219. The concept of musical harmonies intrinsically existing within the spacing of the planets existed in medieval philosophy prior to Kepler. Musica universalis was a traditional philosophical metaphor that was taught in the quadrivium, and was often called the \\"music of the spheres.\\" Kepler was intrigued by this idea while he sought explanation for a rational arrangement of the heavenly bodies.Voelkel, J. R. (1995). The music of the heavens: Kepler's harmonic astronomy. 1994. Physics Today, 48(6), 59‚Äì60. When Kepler uses the term \\"harmony\\" it is not strictly referring to the musical definition, but rather a broader definition encompassing congruence in Nature and the workings of both the celestial and terrestrial bodies. He notes musical harmony as being a product of man, derived from angles, in contrast to a harmony that he refers to as being a phenomenon that interacts with the human soul. In turn, this allowed Kepler to claim the Earth has a soul because it is subjected to astrological harmony. While writing the book, Kepler had to defend his mother in court after she had been accused of witchcraft. Content Kepler divides The Harmony of the World into five long chapters: the first is on regular polygons; the second is on the congruence of figures; the third is on the origin of harmonic proportions in music; the fourth is on harmonic configurations in astrology; the fifth is on the harmony of the motions of the planets.Brackenridge, J. (1982). Kepler, elliptical orbits, and celestial circularity: A study in the persistence of metaphysical commitment part II. Annals of Science, 39(3), 265. Small stellated dodecahedron Great stellated dodecahedronChapters 1 and 2 of The Harmony of the World contain most of Kepler's contributions concerning polyhedra. He is primarily interested with how polygons, which he defines as either regular or semiregular, can come to be fixed together around a central point on a plane to form congruence. His primary objective was to be able to rank polygons based on a measure of sociability, or rather, their ability to form partial congruence when combined with other polyhedra. He returns to this concept later in Harmonices Mundi with relation to astronomical explanations. In the second chapter is the earliest mathematical understanding of two types of regular star polyhedra, the small and great stellated dodecahedron; they would later be called Kepler's solids or Kepler Polyhedra and, together with two regular polyhedra discovered by Louis Poinsot, as the Kepler‚ÄìPoinsot polyhedra.Cromwell, P. R. (1995). Kepler's work on polyhedra. Mathematical Intelligencer, 17(3), 23. He describes polyhedra in terms of their faces, which is similar to the model used in Plato's Timaeus to describe the formation of Platonic solids in terms of basic triangles. The book features illustrations of solids and tiling patterns, some of which are related to the golden ratio. While medieval philosophers spoke metaphorically of the \\"music of the spheres\\", Kepler discovered physical harmonies in planetary motion. He found that the difference between the maximum and minimum angular speeds of a planet in its orbit approximates a harmonic proportion. For instance, the maximum angular speed of the Earth as measured from the Sun varies by a semitone (a ratio of 16:15), from mi to fa, between aphelion and perihelion. Venus only varies by a tiny 25:24 interval (called a diesis in musical terms). Kepler explains the reason for the Earth's small harmonic range: The celestial choir Kepler formed was made up of a tenor (Mars), two bass (Saturn and Jupiter), a soprano (Mercury), and two altos (Venus and Earth). Mercury, with its large elliptical orbit, was determined to be able to produce the greatest number of notes, while Venus was found to be capable of only a single note because its orbit is nearly a circle.The opening of the film Mars et Avril, by Martin Villeneuve, is based on Kepler's cosmological model in Harmonices Mundi, in which the harmony of the universe is determined by the motion of celestial bodies. Beno√Æt Charest also composed the score according to this theory. This opening sequence can be seen here: https://vimeo.com/66697472 At very rare intervals all of the planets would sing together in \\"perfect concord\\": Kepler proposed that this may have happened only once in history, perhaps at the time of creation.Walker, D. P. (1964). Kepler‚Äôs celestial music. Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Vol. 30, pp. 249. Kepler reminds us that harmonic order is only mimicked by man, but has origin in the alignment of the heavenly bodies: Kepler discovers that all but one of the ratios of the maximum and minimum speeds of planets on neighboring orbits approximate musical harmonies within a margin of error of less than a diesis (a 25:24 interval). The orbits of Mars and Jupiter produce the one exception to this rule, creating the inharmonic ratio of 18:19. The cause of this dissonance might be explained by the fact that the asteroid belt, discovered in 1801, separates those two planetary orbits. Chapter 5 includes a long digression on astrology. This is immediately followed by Kepler's third law of planetary motion, which shows a constant proportionality between the cube of the semi-major axis of a planet's orbit and the square of the time of its orbital period. Kepler's previous book, Astronomia nova, related the discovery of the first two principles now known as Kepler's laws.

It is published by Seoul Munhwasa and serialized in IQ Jump Comics, a weekly Korean manhwa magazine. It was printed in the United States by ComicsOne until it closed, and then distributed by Infinity Studios, who mainly published newer volumes digitally, until it was also defunct, leaving the series incomplete to English-speakers. Story The story of NOW is set in Goguryeo and stars Bi-Ryu, a martial artist, and Ah- Rin, a bubbly girl with a sword, as they go on various adventures. The series is currently finished with 25 volumes in South Korea and up to 6 volumes in United States. NOW is an action/fighting oriented comic targeted towards male fans. Characters =Sa-Shin-Mu Disciples= ;Pa Goon-Sung's Disciples * Bi-Ryu () :The main character of NOW. Practitioner of the \\"Sashinmu\\" (ÏÇ¨Ïã†Î¨¥) killing style. He has distinct silver colored hair. He was the adopted grandson of North Star, and holds himself responsible for North Star's death. He seems to be developing a crush on Rin. Bi-Ryu is a rather simple young man, unable to catch up with the times on his own. This is shown when he and Ah-Rin prepare to embark on their quest. She asks if he is all packed, and if so, where are his things. He casts a finger to Cho-Ryung in response. He also had casually walked in on Yhun Ah-Rin and Cho Ryung in a bath, Bi Ryu asked directions and left as though she was not naked, Cho Ryung seems to have the same casualness. However, he is merciless in combat, referring to himself as a Sa-Shin, a death god. He has been shown to descend into a ferocious killing rage during battle, with Ah-Rin being the only one able to return him to normal. * Yu Sae-Ha () : One of the male protagonists of NOW. A good person at first but is becomes twisted and evil by a traumatic incident in the first volume. Originally sent with his brothers to destroy Sashinmu's secrets upon his swordmaster's last wishes. He discovered his older brother had secretly been working for an opposing force, and was nearly killed by him. It was this brother's sword that left the scar on his cheek. Together, the two plunge into a chasm, and he barely survived unlike his brother. He acquires the Sashinmu killing technique from reading the Sashinmu book with the purpose of changing the world so as to acknowledge his strength and, indirectly, his reason for existing. Yu Sae-Ha's style of Sashinmu is unique, for it utilizes negative (ice / Yin) ki instead of positive (fire / Yang) ki, as a result of him having absorbed Yhun Ah-Ran's ki. Originally starting out as a shy and timid character, Yu Sae-Ha grows obsessed with power as the story goes on, willing to do anything to become stronger. He harbors feelings for Yhun Ah-Ran. ;Yhun Oh-Rhang's Disciples * Yhun Ah-Rin () :The 15-year-old female protagonist of NOW. Though powerful thanks to her father's transferred Sashinmu energy, she is considered a bit of a klutz. She seems to be developing a romantic interest upon Bi-Ryu, starting from when Bi Ryu saw her naked body, her mother and sister have told her she has to marry the first man to see her naked body. Her mother, the legendary Whur Ha-Rhang(Lunar Ice in English version) (ÏõîÌïòÎûë), has trained both her and her sister in the Heavenly Mountain Sword Stance, which constantly circulates a type of internal ki to accentuate constant movement in battle. However, when Ah-Rin was younger, she accidentally ingested a poisonous herb. To save her life, her father transmitted some of his own Sashinmu energy to her, thus saving her life and at the same time preventing her from mastering the sword stance at her current level. * Yhun Ah-Ran () : Elder sister of Yhun Ah-Rin. Ah-Rin is much more stoic than her sister. After a confrontation with Bi-Ryu, she is left injured and drained of energy. It is here that she is captured and taken to Mother Demon's palace, where she is held captive until Yu-Sae Ha rescues her. It is discovered that she had killed Demon Mother's younger brother in an earlier confrontation during her search for Rin. She is eventually paired up with Yu Sae-Ha in a secondary storyline. Unlike her sister, Ah-Ran seems to have nearly, if not completely, mastered the stance, as she has displayed advanced techniques. However, as Yu Sae-Ha has absorbed her ki, it is unknown whether or not she is still able to fight. ;Gi-Wang-Mu's Disciple traveling with Bi-Ryu * Cho-Ryung () : A feral cat-like girl that is the traveling companion of Ah-Rin and Bi-Ryu. She is unable to talk and instead makes animal-like noises to communicate. It is speculated that she is the creation of Mother Demon. Bi-Ryu considers her a simple piece of property, to which she holds no objection to. She is very powerful, able to make off with Ah-Rin's rather heavy sword at the beginning of the series holding it only by her teeth. Cho-Ryung, like most animals, despises water and only after being caught and forced will she bathe. =Myung Wang Shin Gyo= () ;Head * The former head :She was also a reincarnation of Parvati. She is the eldest sister of Shiva and Ganesha. During a war between the Shaolin and the Myeong Wang Shin Gyo, she sacrificed herself by throwing her own body into fire in order to save Shiva and the Myong Wang Shin Gyo children. * Nirvana (ÎãàÎ•¥Î∞îÎÇò) : A little girl introduced in volume 4, Nirvana is not all she appears to be. She is Indian and is first seen as a child who Ah-Gi has taken to kill and make into food. Bi-Ryu and Ah-Rin show up just in time to save her, though she shows no fear towards the man. He believes her to be a mute, as she has not spoken since he abducted her. Later, after meeting Bi Ryu's Party she speaks slowly with future predictions, accurately predicting Yhun Ah-Rin kicking Bi Ryu. It is also known that she apparently is wanted, as a group of assassins intrude upon Bi-Ryu's party and attempt to kill them to take Nirvana. She seems to like Cho Ryung, as she hugs her like a stuffed animal a lot (She's also the only one who can understand what Cho Ryung says). She carries the memory of the former heads of Myung Wong Shin Gyo, Parvati. ;Chief Minister and Left-Right Ministers * Asura (ÏïÑÏàòÎùº) : The former chief minister of Myung Wong Shin Gyo, master of Shiva. He and Sho-Rhim's head Cheon Jong were former friends, they planned to keep the peace between Chinese Martial World and Myung Gyo, but failed by the evil Sho-Rhim monk Cheon Seung, who only followed the way of power. * Brahma Brothers They were the ministers of Myung Wong Shin Gyo, in the generation of Shiva's eldest sister. : After the Cult's House had been destroyed, they served Shiva as new chief minister. When they discovered that Shiva was using Yaksha's seal to create Ananga, they attempted to stop him but were defeated. The elder lost his eyes and two arms, while the younger lost the lower body. They combined to form a body to protect together. They taught Yu Sae-Ha the secret skill of Gyu Yeom ‚Äî grandmaster of Sa-Shin-Mu ‚Äî Pa-Yeol-Jin (Destroying Quake). * Shiva (ÏãúÎ∞î) : Chief minister of Myeong Wang Shin Gyo. He used Yaksha's seal to create the Ananga to assist him in the way to destroy the Chinese Martial World. * Lakshmi (ÎùºÌÅ¨ÏäàÎØ∏) :Head of the security detail in Myeong Wang Shin Gyo. She and Ganesha make up the Ministers of the Right and Left respectively. Her primary duty is to provide security to the Chief Minister (Shiva). Her and Ganesha are apparently not on good terms. It is said that her powers are on par with Ganesha, but she is not the \\"brute force\\" type. Instead, she is known to make deals and use subversive methods to do her job. She often passes herself off as the \\"lovely little lady\\". When Ganesha returns with Yu Sae-Ha and Yhun Ah-Rin, Shiva requests that she \\"lightly spar\\" with Yu Sae-Ha. She displays here her actual strength, seeming to teleport to and from. It also seems her physical strength is above average, as with one kick, she sends Yu Sae-Ha flying upwards into the air, despite his unintentional defense. She also cares much for Rakshasha, despite her attempts to deny it. * Ganesha (Í∞ÄÎÑ§ÏÉ§) :The Head of Security in the Myung Wong Shin Gyo. He seems to be a controlling man, telling Ran and Rin's parents he had come to handle business with Mother Demon, but became captivated with their fighting skills. His apparently true purpose of coming was to obtain the secrets of Sashinmu. He seems to be powerful as well, escaping from the two skilled warriors with the only damage received the losing of the bottom portion of his mask. He entices Yu Sae-Ha to accompany him to Myeong Wang Shin Gyo along with Yhun Ah-Ran. It is later revealed that he is the twin (younger) brother of Shiva, and that he only takes off his mask when he is needed to \\"stand in\\" for Shiva in certain situations. ;Chil-Rhun-Sa (Seven-Wheels Children) () * Cheong Mok () :Il-Rhun (, Sun Wheel) : A Westerner who, as a child, was brought into the East as a slave. He has the skill Dok-Shim-Sul (Mind-Reading Skill), as well as high-level Qing Gong. He tested Bi Ryu's strength before revealing him the way to the Myeong Wang Shin Gyo. * Unknown member - Whur-Rhun (, Moon Wheel) :He is the assassin sent to kill Ah-Rin in Mo-Yong house. But he is killed by Ja Hye and Mo-Yong Bi. In the end, he puts a joke: \\"I'm killed so fast that I can't present my name!\\". * Akni (ÏïÑÌÅ¨Îãà) :Hwa-Rhun (, Fire Wheel) * Baraha (Î∞îÎùºÌïò) :To-Rhun (, Earth Wheel) : Is his best status in the ground. Defeated by Bi-Ryu. * Matshia (ÎßàÌä∏ÏãúÏïÑ) :Sue-Rhun (, Water Wheel) : Is his best battle status in the deep water. Defeated by Ah-Rin. * Hanuman (ÌïòÎàÑÎßå) :Mok-Rhun (, Wooden Wheel) : Uses the poisonous insects to eliminate opponents. Defeated by Mo-Yong Rin and Hyun. * Rakshasha (ÎùºÌÅ¨ÏÉ§ÏÉ§) :Kim-Rhun (, Metal Wheel) : Best in assassination. Defeated by Ah-Ran. ;Gwi-Wang-Mo's faction (Lady Demon King Mother) * Gwi-Wang-Mo () : An old lady with powerful strength. She raised Cho Ryung, So Goon, Shi Rang, and the Mae Ran Guk Juk. Her desire to become the strongest in the Wulin World went to smoke when she met Yhun Orang. Ultimately, she died by the hands of Lakshmi, but not before showing last bit of kindness to her pupil, So Gun. * So Gun () : A beautiful cross-dressing boy. He used to envy \\"Baek-Rhang-Gyeon\\" (White Wolf-Dog), who actually is Cho- Ryung, because his master praised her very highly. After his master's death, he sets out to seek revenge against Ma Yeom Cheol, who he mistakenly believed had killed his master. * Shi Rang () : Another cross-dressing boy in Gi-Wang- Mu's faction. After Cho-Ryung's escape, the Demon Mother had Shi Rang wearing the hand-claws with hope equal to Cho-Ryung's ability. * The four sisters : Mae, Ran, Guk, Juk () are the guardian quadruplets protecting their master. They are later \\"freed\\" after So Gun, who wished them to experience freedom, decided to undertake the revenge for his master by himself. Their names are flowers: Ochna, Orchid, Chrysanthemum, Phyllostachys ;Others * Britra (Î∏åÎ¶¨Ìä∏Îùº) : A powerful fighter of Myung Wong Shin Gyo. He provoked Sae-Ha and Ah-Ran when they first came there. Defeated and killed by Sae-Ha after his training with the Brahma brothers, two former ministers of Myung Wong Shin Gyo in Shiva's eldest sister's generation. * Ah-Gi () : An evil monk who is also a cannibal. He wields a cooking knife attached to a chain, which emits loud clinking sounds meant to distract the opponent during battle and perhaps make up for a lack of physical strength. He flaunts himself as a master cook. As the story progresses, Ah-Gi becomes more of a comic relief character than an actual threat. He has his own pages, located at the end of the Manhwa, called \\"Ask Ah-Gi,\\" a short comical strip of few pages where he (supposedly) answers questions from the readers, often involving Ah-Rin and Ah-Ran, and ends up getting beaten up/stabbed/slashed/etc. by the two girls. * Dharma (Îã§Î•¥Îßà) : An antagonist introduced in volume 4, he is a large muscular man with dark skin. His weapon is a spear named Shin-Chang NAGA that absorbs all his negative ki thus giving him the ability to hide his ki in fights. He is defeated by Bi Ryu, after mortally wounding Yhun Ah Rin. This inspires Bi-Ryu to \\"pass judgement\\" and deliver the \\"Seven Dark Star Attacks\\" upon the man and finally kill him. His last sight is that of Nirvana, whom he states is the Founder of Myeong Wang Shin Gyo. * Seop Poong (ÏÑ≠Ìíç) : An assassin from Gi-Ryung-Bae, an assassin faction. He is the younger brother of Seop Jung, who was killed by Whur Ha-Rhang in The Legend of the Sirius.

Notes * NOW is a sequel to an earlier Sung-woo Park manhwa, Cheollang Yeoljeon (Legend of the Sirius), which featured Yhun Oh-Rhang and Whur Ha-Rhang, the parents of Yhun Ah-Rin and Ah-Ran. Thus the significance of some characters and story might be lost without reading the prequel. * This manhwa was formerly distributed in the United States in English by ComicsOne. It was later acquired by Infinity Studios. * The Sa-Shin-Mu Martial Art is divided to five ways: Cheong-Ryong, Baek-Ho, Hyeon-Mu, Ju-Jak and Hwang-Ryong. In these ways, the Hwang-Ryong is the most powerful. The five ways are based on the Ssu Ling Gods of Chinese mythology: Qing Long, Bai Hu, Xuan Wu, Zhu Que and Huang Long. A disciple only learns it when he can remove his killing aura. The ultimate skills are \\"Pa- Yeol-Jin\\" and \\"Mu-Jin\\", \\"Pa-Yeol-Jin\\" is the most powerful skill of killing sashinmu, and \\"Mu-Jin\\" is the most powerful skill in the complete sashinmu. * The faction \\"Myung Wong Shin Gyo\\" or shortcut to \\"Myung Gyo\\" is the cult \\"Ming Jiao\\" (ÊòéÊïô), a Persian Cult which is called \\"Mo Jiao\\" (È≠îÊïô, Demonic Cult) by the Chinese martial artists. The story of this faction is told in Jin Yong's novel Yi Tian Tu Long Ji (the tale about Yitian-jian, the heavenly sword, and Tulong-dao, the dragon saber). * If you read the manhwa carefully, you will notice the names of Myung Gyo's members are based on the names in Hindu mythology. Examples are Shiva, Nirvana, Ganesha, Lakshmi, Rakshasha, Akni, Hanuman, Baraha, Asura, etc. Publishers NOW was originally published by ComicsOne Corp.

It provided both automatic and manual rotation and translation by means of 16 vernier thrusters using hypergolic propellants. Operations The OAMS had 16 small, fixed-position, fixed-thrust rocket engines which burned hypergolic propellants (monomethylhydrazine fuel using nitrogen tetroxide as oxidizer) fed under pressure from a pair of tanks located in the aft Equipment Module. Besides providing attitude control, the OAMS provided for linear up, down, sideways, forward or aft translation of the spacecraft. This gave the spacecraft the capability to change its orbit, required for space rendezvous and docking with another spacecraft, the Agena Target Vehicle. The system was also used to push the spacecraft away from the spent second stage of the Titan II launch vehicle on first reaching orbit. *The eight rotational control engines were mounted off the spacecraft's center of mass around the aft section of the Equipment Module, pointed at 90 degree positions up, down, left and right. These were rated at thrust and fired in pairs, causing it to yaw, pitch, or roll to control attitude. *Six of the translational control engines were mounted on the side of the Retrorocket Module, near the spacecraft's center of mass. Four of these were rated at thrust, one each pointed up, down, left or right. The other two were pointed forward, at the three o'clock and nine o'clock positions, to provide aft thrust. These were rated at (reduced from the original spec of in July 1962). *The two thrust forward translation control engines were mounted on the inside of the aft end of the equipment adapter, at the twelve o'clock and six o'clock positions. Project Mercury astronauts could only adjust yaw, pitch, or roll, but Gemini crewmen had full manual control over their flight path. Walter Schirra said that on Gemini 6 \\"I was amazed at my ability to maneuver. I did a fly-around inspection of Gemini 7, literally flying rings around it, and I could move to within inches of it in perfect confidence\\". Because there is no turbulence in space \\"It was like the Blue Angels at 18,000 miles per hour, only it was easier\\". Events During Gemini 8, on March 16, 1966, OAMS engine number 8 became stuck on, resulting in uncontrollable spinning of the spacecraft. The entire OAMS had to be shut down and the mission was terminated prematurely. This resulted in modifications to OAMS to permit engine isolation.

It is needed for the breakdown of adenosine from food and for the turnover of nucleic acids in tissues. Its primary function in humans is the development and maintenance of the immune system. However, the full physiological role of ADA is not yet completely understood.  Structure  ADA exists in both small form (as a monomer) and large form (as a dimer-complex). In the monomer form, the enzyme is a polypeptide chain, folded into eight strands of parallel Œ±/Œ≤ barrels, which surround a central deep pocket that is the active site. In addition to the eight central Œ≤-barrels and eight peripheral Œ±-helices, ADA also contains five additional helices: residues 19-76 fold into three helices, located between Œ≤1 and Œ±1 folds; and two antiparallel carboxy-terminal helices are located across the amino-terminal of the Œ≤-barrel. The ADA active site contains a zinc ion, which is located in the deepest recess of the active site and coordinated by five atoms from His15, His17, His214, Asp295, and the substrate. Zinc is the only cofactor necessary for activity. The substrate, adenosine, is stabilized and bound to the active site by nine hydrogen bonds. The carboxyl group of Glu217, roughly coplanar with the substrate purine ring, is in position to form a hydrogen bond with N1 of the substrate. The carboxyl group of Asp296, also coplanar with the substrate purine ring, forms hydrogen bond with N7 of the substrate. The NH group of Gly184 is in position to form a hydrogen bond with N3 of the substrate. Asp296 forms bonds both with the Zn2+ ion as well as with 6-OH of the substrate. His238 also hydrogen bonds to substrate 6-OH. The 3'-OH of the substrate ribose forms a hydrogen bond with Asp19, while the 5'-OH forms a hydrogen bond with His17. Two further hydrogen bonds are formed to water molecules, at the opening of the active site, by the 2'-OH and 3'-OH of the substrate. Due to the recessing of the active site inside the enzyme, the substrate, once bound, is almost completely sequestered from solvent. The surface exposure of the substrate to solvent when bound is 0.5% the surface exposure of the substrate in the free state.  Reactions  ADA irreversibly deaminates adenosine, converting it to the related nucleoside inosine by the substitution of the amino group by a keto group. Adenosine Inosine Inosine can then be deribosylated (removed from ribose) by another enzyme called purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), converting it to hypoxanthine.  Mechanism of catalysis  The proposed mechanism for ADA-catalyzed deamination is stereospecific addition-elimination via tetrahedral intermediate. By either mechanism, Zn2+ as a strong electrophile activates a water molecule, which is deprotonated by the basic Asp295 to form the attacking hydroxide. His238 orients the water molecule and stabilizes the charge of the attacking hydroxide. Glu217 is protonated to donate a proton to N1 of the substrate. The reaction is stereospecific due to the location of the zinc, Asp295, and His238 residues, which all face the B-side of the purine ring of the substrate. Competitive inhibition has been observed for ADA, where the product inosine acts at the competitive inhibitor to enzymatic activity.  Function  ADA is considered one of the key enzymes of purine metabolism. The enzyme has been found in bacteria, plants, invertebrates, vertebrates, and mammals, with high conservation of amino acid sequence. The high degree of amino acid sequence conservation suggests the crucial nature of ADA in the purine salvage pathway. Primarily, ADA in humans is involved in the development and maintenance of the immune system. However, ADA association has also been observed with epithelial cell differentiation, neurotransmission, and gestation maintenance. It has also been proposed that ADA, in addition to adenosine breakdown, stimulates release of excitatory amino acids and is necessary to the coupling of A1 adenosine receptors and heterotrimeric G proteins. Adenosine deaminase deficiency leads to pulmonary fibrosis, suggesting that chronic exposure to high levels of adenosine can exacerbate inflammation responses rather than suppressing them. It has also been recognized that adenosine deaminase protein and activity is upregulated in mouse hearts that overexpress HIF-1 alpha, which in part explains the attenuated levels of adenosine in HIF-1 alpha expressing hearts during ischemic stress.  Pathology  Some mutations in the gene for adenosine deaminase cause it not to be expressed. The resulting deficiency is one cause of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), particularly of autosomal recessive inheritance. Deficient levels of ADA have also been associated with pulmonary inflammation, thymic cell death, and defective T-cell receptor signaling. Conversely, mutations causing this enzyme to be overexpressed are one cause of hemolytic anemia. There is some evidence that a different allele (ADA2) may lead to autism. Elevated levels of ADA has also been associated with AIDS.  Isoforms  There are 2 isoforms of ADA: ADA1 and ADA2. * ADA1 is found in most body cells, particularly lymphocytes and macrophages, where it is present not only in the cytosol and nucleus but also as the ecto- form on the cell membrane attached to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (aka, CD26). ADA1 is involved mostly in intracellular activity, and exists both in small form (monomer) and large form (dimer). The interconversion of small to large forms is regulated by a 'conversion factor' in the lung. * ADA2 was first identified in human spleen. It was subsequently found in other tissues including the macrophage where it co-exists with ADA1. The two isoforms regulate the ratio of adenosine to deoxyadenosine potentiating the killing of parasites. ADA2 is found predominantly in the human plasma and serum, and exists solely as a homodimer.  Clinical significance  ADA2 is the predominant form present in human blood plasma and is increased in many diseases, particularly those associated with the immune system: for example rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and sarcoidosis. The plasma ADA2 isoform is also increased in most cancers. ADA2 is not ubiquitous but co-exists with ADA1 only in monocytes-macrophages. Total plasma ADA can be measured using high performance liquid chromatography or enzymatic or colorimetric techniques. Perhaps the simplest system is the measurement of the ammonia released from adenosine when broken down to inosine. After incubation of plasma with a buffered solution of adenosine the ammonia is reacted with a Berthelot reagent to form a blue colour which is proportionate to the amount of enzyme activity. To measure ADA2, erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine (EHNA) is added prior to incubation so as to inhibit the enzymatic activity of ADA1. It is the absence of ADA1 that causes SCID. ADA can also be used in the workup of lymphocytic pleural effusions or peritoneal ascites, in that such specimens with low ADA levels essentially excludes tuberculosis from consideration. Tuberculosis pleural effusions can now be diagnosed accurately by increased levels of pleural fluid adenosine deaminase, above 40 U per liter. Cladribine and Pentostatin are anti-neoplastic agents used in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia; their mechanism of action is inhibition of adenosine deaminase.

The company was co-founded by five former Rainbow Arts employees in 1987 in Cologne, Germany, which served as the inspiration behind the studio's name. In order to have a stronger relationship with Factor 5's North American partners like LucasArts, Factor 5, Inc. was established in the United States in May 1996 with legal support from LucasArts, and in late 1996 the core of the development team in Germany was relocated to the North American company headquarters in San Rafael, California.FACTOR 5 Julian Eggebrecht, one of the five initial co-founders, served as President of Factor 5's U.S. branch. The U.S. company closed in May 2009, following the closure of Brash Entertainment, with which the company had multiple contracts. The original German company, headed by CEO Achim Moller, remained active due to its unrelated business policy and operations with the North American company. However, in January 2011, Moller liquidated Factor 5 GmbH, and all game licenses were transferred to \\"Eggebrecht, Engel, Schmidt GbR\\".http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=451147 On March 15, 2017, Factor 5 co-founder Julian Eggebrecht had announced that the company has returned and reacquired the rights to the Turrican franchise.http://gonintendo.com/stories/276107-factor-5-rises-from-the-ashes- reacquires-turrican-license-gives History The programming group which would eventually become Factor 5 had originally formed in the 1980s, in what cofounder Julian Eggebrecht described as a culture of hacking and multimedia programming on the local demo scene. Eggebrecht attended the Filmhochschule in Munich to become a movie director, and all the other members studied computer science. While its founders were still university students, Factor 5 started out in game development as a part-time activity under partnership with Rainbow Arts for the Amiga computer. There, they had their earliest moderate success with Katakis, an R-Type clone of impressive technical performance. Due to the game's obvious similarity to R-Type, rights holder Activision Europe delivered an ultimatum: either Factor 5 accept a contract to perform the official R-Type conversion for the Amiga home computer, or receive a lawsuit for rights infringement. According to Julian Eggebrecht, this was because \\"Activision couldn't find any programmers\\" however the opportunity was \\"a dream come true\\". Their first important success, however, came with Turrican, a game designed by Rainbow Arts designer Manfred Trenz. Factor 5 handled the Amiga and Atari ST versions of the game; and together with the original Commodore 64 version and several others, Turrican was a major hit across Europe in 1990. In 1991, faced with the prospect of corporate formalities imposed by the video game console industry, the company founders quit school in favor of full-time corporate careers. Eggebrecht explained, \\"[t]he moment you go into console programming, you won't get a development system from Nintendo unless you have a reputable company.\\" After they finished work on Turrican II: The Final Fight for the Amiga and Atari ST in 1991, Factor 5 built their own development kits and software environments for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Mega Drive/Genesis, codenamed Pegasus SNES and Pegasus Mega Drive. Subsequently, they decided to focus their efforts towards console game development in 1992 with several projects for the SNES and Mega Drive/Genesis, including new Turrican games and other titles contracted by companies like LucasArts, Hudson Soft and Konami, the latter of which had also Game Boy development contracts with them. In 1993, Factor 5 produced their last Amiga effort, an Amiga conversion of Mega Turrican handled with programming support from fellow company Neon Studios. They would develop games for the SNES, Mega Drive/Genesis, and Game Boy until 1996, when they switched their efforts to the PlayStation. With the development of PlayStation games for LucasArts, the personnel located in Germany experienced communication difficulties in working with their North American partner due to the distance between both countries and the Internet speeds of that time being insufficient for the requirements of console development. This, together with legal assistance offered by LucasArts, resulted in a new Factor 5 branch in California. There, the core of the development team from Germany was established after they finished work on their PlayStation games in late 1996. For a long time, the North American branch of Factor 5 was an exclusive, prominent development partner with both LucasArts and Nintendo, developing both game titles for the former and middleware tools for the latter. During that time, the studio gained considerable critical and commercial praise for its technical proficiency, producing what are often cited as some of the most visually advanced titles on the Nintendo 64 and the Nintendo GameCube, all based on LucasArts properties. Two high-profile middleware tools were also developed by the company for Nintendo: MusyX, a sound system produced in cooperation with Dolby Laboratories; and the DivX For Games SDK, integrating the functionality of the popular video codec into Nintendo's development tools. In late December 2008, several online media outlets reported that Brash Entertainment (Factor 5's publisher of their current project) would close at the end of the month after encountering financial problems. This sudden interruption in funding left Factor 5 with their own funding difficulties, eventually causing its closure in May 2009. Factor 5 had been involved in litigation with its former employees in the defunct North American Factor 5 company. The suit alleges that Factor 5 did not pay its employees for work during November and December, that employees were laid off without the required notice by law, that employees did not receive their vacation pay, and that the company misled the employees.

He is generally categorised as a new-age musician and uses a modified electroacoustic harp of his own design. He has worked with Bobby McFerrin, Carly Simon, Luciano Pavarotti and in 1987 received a Grammy Award for the album Down to the Moon. Vollenweider's style has been described by The New York Times as \\"swirling atmospheric music, which evokes nature, magic and fairy tales\\". Biography =Early life= Vollenweider was born in 1953 and is the son of Hans Vollenweider (1918‚Äì1993), an organist and composer, while his mother was a painter. In 1971, he married Beata, a kindergarten teacher, with whom he has two sons (Jonathan and Sebastian) and a daughter, No√´mi. In 1975, Vollenweider discovered the harp and, finding its traditional versions too limited for his own musical ideas, developed his own style, tailoring the instrument according to his needs. He created the electro-acoustic harp. He formed the trio Poesie und Musik together with Rene Bardet (bass) and Orlando Valentini (guitar), recording interpretations of the poetry of Fran√ßois Villon and Heinrich Heine, but left in 1978.Poesie und Musik in the catalog of the Deutschen National Bibliothek During this period, Vollenweider also wrote music for film, mainly nature documentaries. =Career=  1980s  In 1979 he released his solo debut, Eine Art Suite in XIII Teilen in Switzerland.Discogs.com entry, the album was re-released in 1984. He subsequently began forming his ensemble ‚ÄúAndreas Vollenweider and Friends‚Äù, which included Walter Keiser (drums), Pedro Haldemann (percussion), Bobby Reveron (percussion), and Jon Otis (percussion). This five-piece debuted on July 11, 1981, at the Montreux Jazz Festival.Montreux Jazz Live listing from 1981. Vollenweider was discovered by the German record-producer and manager Vera Brandes, who oversaw the release of Behind the Gardens - Behind the Wall - Under the Tree.... through her VeraBra Records. The album was distributed through CBS Records International and reached 32 in the German album charts in March 1982.Detailed listing from the German Album chart. The follow-up Caverna Magica was recorded in the period May‚ÄìNovember 1982 while Vollenweider and his band performed around Europe.Discogs.com listing for the album. Released in January 1983, the album managed to reach 11 in the German album chart.Detailed German chart listing . In 1983, he underlined his commitment to environmental issues with the EP \\"Pace Verde\\" in support for Greenpeace, which was accompanied by a video that Vollenweider directed and produced himself. In October of that year he was awarded a Dutch Edison Award in the Instrumental category for Caverna Magica. In 1984, the album White Winds entered the American billboard chart.Billboard chart-listing for Andreas Vollenweider. Released through CBS Masterworks in North America, his records remained on catalogue, clocking up to six-figure sales. Vollenweider embarked on his first American tour in November of that year, making his debut at the Beacon Theatre, New York. It was presented by Carly Simon who had come across his music a year earlier. She explained that \\"I knew I had discovered something that was going to change me in a wonderful way, I became so obsessed with his music that anyone who came to my house was introduced to it within the first 10 or 15 minutes\\". Through CBS she got in contact with the artist and arranged for his American debut. As his instrumental tracks were generally deemed unsuitable for radio, he largely relied on word-of-mouth in gathering an international following. Vollenweider spent much of 1985 on tour, promoting the White Winds album with his five- piece band. The shows were described as a new age experience that combined the use of lights and dry ice while Vollenweider appeared as a \\"white-clad figure who's poised to drive the audience wild with a harp\\". In 1987, Down To The Moon, which had been originally recorded and released in 1984, received a Grammy Award. This was followed by tours in Canada, the United States, thirteen European countries, Japan, and Australia. When he composed the music of, and recorded, the dynamic album Dancing With The Lion in 1988 and 1989, Vollenweider opened his project, for the first time in his career, to numerous guests from a wide range of musical genres. He directed and produced two award-winning videos, one of which was for the title selection; for both videos, he contributed to the storyline, the choreography, and set/costume designs.  1990s  Vollenweider's double album The Trilogy (1990), consisted of a selection of the first three albums (Behind The Gardens, Caverna Magica, and White Winds) and previously unreleased material. In 1991, he followed up with Book of Roses, which included symphonic orchestral elements for the first time. In 1992, he participated in a benefit show for Chernobyl's children on Moscow's Red Square. The same year, he won the World Music Award in Monaco. In 1993-94, he produced his first album including vocals. The 1993‚Äì94 album Eolian Minstrel featured contributions from American singers Carly Simon and Eliza Gilkyson. The release was followed by worldwide tours. In 1994, he performed at the Pavarotti and Friends event in Modena, Italy, where he played duets with operatic lyric tenor Luciano Pavarotti (a native of Modena) and Canadian rock balladeer Bryan Adams. After conducting tours and open-air shows in Europe and the United States, in 1995 he played in Latin America for the first time. 1995‚Äì97 saw Vollenweider playing a series of shows in remarkable locations: a tour of Polish castles, a show with Italian singer/songwriter Zucchero at the 2500 m high location (at -8¬∞ Celsius) of Brunico in the Southern Alps, and in a giant volcanic cave at Lanzarote's Festival Musica Visual. In 1998, Vollenweider began the recording of Kryptos, a work for symphonic orchestras and guest virtuosos from all over the world. He initiated a symphonic live project which he called Wolkenstein. In 1999, he returned to free improvisation and intimate musical dialogues with his album COSMOPOLY He invited friends, including American vocal acrobat Bobby McFerrin, Brazilian cult poet and singer Milton Nascimento, South-African ethno-jazz pianist Abdullah Ibrahim, the 74-year-old Armenian duduk legend Djivan Gasparyan, Galician bag-pipe and whistle virtuoso Carlos N√∫√±ez Mu√±oz, the American singer-songwriter Carly Simon, and American blues-trombone master Ray Anderson, from all over the globe to create ‚Äúworld music‚Äù.  2000s  Throughout 2000, he traveled with the COSMOPOLY project in Europe. Its changing configuration of musicians ‚Äî almost daily ‚Äî enabled Vollenweider to follow the open concept of the album. In New York City, he and his friends played two concerts for the United States release. Carly Simon joined the group, as did Mindy Jostyn, Carlos N√∫√±ez, Djivan Gasparyan, XiaoJing Wang and Walter Keiser. Concerts in Brazil ‚Äî with Milton Nascimento and composer/pianist Wagner Tiso ‚Äî followed. In 2001, Vollenweider performed in Bali (Indonesia) at the international conference \\"song of convergence\\" with Balinese musicians. He began writing the \\"symphonic novel\\" Tales of Kira Kutan, which premiered at the Warsaw Film Music Festival 2001, with the orchestra Sinfonia Varsowia (Yehudi Menuhin), conducted by co-orchestrator Andr√© Bellmont. Returning to his native Switzerland, Vollenweider premiered Carte blanche at the AVO Festival in Basel, where his guests, in addition to a mini orchestra, included Abdullah Ibrahim and David Lindley. In 2002, he performed at the Budapest Spring Festival in Hungary. Performances of the symphonies Tales of Kira Kutan and Wolkenstein at the Festival \\"Live at Sunset\\" in Zurich, with Sinfonia Varsovia, followed, as did a European summer tour, with the newly formed AVAF-mini orchestra, that included a performance at the \\"Big Chill Festival\\" in England and continued that fall. It was around this time that he collaborated with German film composer Hans Zimmer, in Los Angeles, on the music score for the movie Tears of the Sun (starring Bruce Willis and Monica Bellucci). In 2003, he continued his work with Zimmer. A performance followed, with his mini orchestra, in Johannesburg and at the \\"North Sea Festival\\" in Cape Town. In 2004 and 2005, AVAF continued to increase touring activities in Europe. At this time, Vollenweider's entire catalogue was re-mastered and re-released on new record labels worldwide (USA/Canada: www.kinkoumusic.com; international: www.edel.com). A compilation, The Best of \\"Magic Harp, was released in the United States and Canada, and The Storyteller was released in Europe. A four-hour DVD was also produced. He played for the Dalai Lama, when the latter paid a visit in Zurich. In 2005, he released the album VOX. In the first three months of 2006, following extensive touring in Europe, Vollenweider conducted his first tour of the US in over ten years, touring from coast to coast. At that time, he also released his first DVD, The Magical Journeys of Andreas Vollenweider, which contained almost four hours of live concerts, documentaries, interviews. During the summer of that year, he recorded a new album, titled Midnight Clear, in which he again collaborated with Carly Simon. (See above for his previous collaborations with her.) The last three months of 2006 saw Vollenweider touring in Europe, in addition to his release of Midnight Clear on a worldwide basis and that of the DVD The Magical Journeys of Andreas Vollenweider in the rest of the world. 2007 saw Vollenweider draw his third nomination for a Grammy Award for the soundtrack album of the current DVD release The Magical Journeys of Andreas Vollenweider. Concerts in Europe and the United States followed, as did, in September of that year, the release of the two-CD double album Andreas Vollenweider & Friends - 25 Years Live, which covered the period from 1982 to 2007. In 2008, during his composition of the music for, and his recording of, the album A I R, Vollenweider was a guest performer at the celebration concert for the 80th birthday of Armenian duduk legend Jivan Gasparyan.  2010s  In 2010, Vollenweider gave concerts in Eastern and Western Europe. In June, he undertook a special concert project, which he titled The Watercourse Way, at the Shanghai Centre in Shanghai, China, as part of Expo 2010. A \\"Dream Concert\\" of the extended AVAF followed in August, as did the \\"Dancing With The Lion Orchestra\\" concert on the shore of Lake Zurich; it featured a gathering of Vollenweider's musical friends from all corners of the world. In 2011, three decades after his first concert, he accepted the invitation of Montreux Jazz Festival founder Claude Nobs to perform an exclusive jubilee concert, on 7 July, at the 45th such Festival, titled \\"30 Years Andreas Vollenweider & Friends\\". It featured special guests Richard Bona and Raul Midon. In 2012, he played at the farewell concert for Claude Nobs, who had died in January of that year. In the same year Vollenweider was granted the Swiss Music Award for \\"Outstanding Achievement Award\\" for his continuing life's work. On Christmas Eve, Swiss Television broadcasts the first major documentary devoted to Vollenweider, in which filmmaker Cristina Karrer shows impressing and touching sequences recorded in October 2010 in South Africa. In May 2012 Andreas Vollenweider lends his name to a campaign by ROKPA, a charity he has been working with for decades. Children who had once lived on the streets in Kathmandu, Nepal, visit eight Swiss cities to tell their moving stories using theatre, dance and music, with a changing roster of Swiss musical guests and an equally celebrated line-up of TV moderators. For a scientific study conducted between 2013 and 2016 by researchers at the University of Geneva (UNIGE) and the University Hospitals of Geneva (HUG) in Switzerland, Vollenweider wrote music that was specifically designed to improve the neural development of premature babies. The composer wrote three sound environments of eight minutes each, with punji, harp and bells pieces. The neural networks of premature babies who heard Vollenweider's music were significantly improved, becoming more similar to those of full-term newborns, \\"providing evidence for a beneficial effect of music on the preterm brain\\".  Style  His style has been described as weaving \\"elements of European classical and folk music, Third World vocal and percussive effects and natural sound effects into cyclical suites\\". Vollenweider is perceived as one of the purveyors of the New Age genre, although his earlier recordings appeared on the jazz Billboard chart. The composer found that \\"what I am doing is really a very old thing, a very 'old age' thing, because I'm doing what people have been doing for thousands of years'. Personal life Vollenweider resides near Zurich. =Activism= In the 1980s, Vollenweider was described as someone whose \\"politics run to the left, including support for Amnesty International and Greenpeace\\". He is an outspoken pacifist and follower of the principles of non-violent conflict management of Mahatma Gandhi.

It was selected as a marching tune for Australian, British, Canadian, and American military formations, including General George Armstrong Custer's 7th Cavalry Regiment and Australia's 2 Cav Regiment.  History  The word garryowen is derived from Irish, the proper name E√≥in (an Irish form of John) and the word for garden garrai ‚Äì thus \\"E√≥in's Garden\\". A church dating to the 12th century by the Knights Templar, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, is the source of the modern area of Garryowen in the city of Limerick, Ireland. Owen's Garden, overlooking the River Shannon was a fashionable retreat and recreational area for the citizens of Limerick. The song emerged during the late 18th century, when it was a drinking song of rich young roisterers in Limerick. An alternate title is \\"Let Bacchus' sons be not dismayed\\". Sung to the tune \\"Auld Bessie\\", it obtained immediate popularity in the British Army through the 5th (or Royal Irish) Regiment of Dragoons. It was published with additional lyrics in Thomas Moore's 1808 \\"Irish Melodies\\".\\"We May Roam Through This World\\", Library Ireland Beethoven composed two arrangements of the song during 1809‚Äì1810 (published 1814‚Äì1816 in W.o.O. 152 and W.o.O. 154) with the title, \\"From Garyone My Happy Home\\", with lyrics by T. Toms, on romantic themes. The arrangements were part of a large project by George Thomson to engage prominent composers of his time to write arrangements of the folk songs of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.\\"Beethoven: Folksong Settings\\" by Barry Cooper The composer Mauro Giuliani arranged the tune in Arie Nazionali Irlandesi nr.1-6 Op.125 (Six Irish Airs). The Bohemian composer Ignaz Moscheles (1794 ‚Äì 1870) included the tune in his op. 89 Souvenirs de l'Irlande, \\"Recollections of Ireland\\", for solo piano and orchestra. =British military units= A very early reference to the tune appears in the publication The Life of the Duke of Wellington by Jocquim Hayward Stocqueler, published during 1853. He describes the defence of the town of Tarifa during the Peninsular War, late December 1811. General H. Gough, later Field Marshal Hugh Gough, 1st Viscount Gough, commanding officer of the 87th Regiment (Later the Royal Irish Fusiliers), under attack by French Grenadiers, drew his sword, tossed his scabbard, and called on his men to stand with him until the enemy should walk over their bodies. The troops responded with the \\"Garryowen\\". It was used as a march by the 88th Regiment of Foot (Connaught Rangers) during the Peninsular War. Garryowen was also a favourite during the Crimean War. The tune has also been associated with a number of British military units, and is the authorised regimental march of The Irish Regiment of Canada. It was the regimental march of the Liverpool Irish, British Army. It is the regimental march of the London Irish Rifles (now part of The London Regiment (TA)). It was also the regimental march of the 50th (Queen's Own) Foot until 1869. Garryowen is the Quick March and Canter March of the Welsh Horse Yeomanry, a civilian organisation based in South West Wales, who perform Cavalry and Living History Displays, including the Welsh Horse Musical Ride, in which the tune Garryowen features prominently. See www.welshhorse.co.uk Garry Owen most recently was also the Regimental Quick March of The Ulster Defence Regiment CGS (UDR). When the UDR merged with The Royal Irish Rangers during 1992 to become The Royal Irish Regiment, Garry Owen was replaced by Killaloe. =US military units= During early 1851 Irish citizens of New York City formed a militia regiment known locally as the Second Regiment of Irish Volunteers. The group selected \\"Garryowen\\" as their official regimental marching song. On 12 October 1851, the Regiment was accepted officially as part of the New York Militia and designated as 69th Infantry Regiment, New York Militia, (the famed \\"Fighting 69th\\" ). It is presently known officially as the 1st Battalion, 69th Infantry and is part of the 42nd Infantry Division.\\"Garryowen\\", The 1st Cavalry Division Association The song is heard several times throughout the Warner Bros. movie The Fighting 69th (1940), starring James Cagney, Pat O'Brien, and Alan Hale, Sr., which chronicles the World War I exploits of the U.S. 69th Infantry Regiment, New York National Guard. 7th Cavalry It later became the marching tune for the American 7th Cavalry Regiment during the late 19th century. The tune was brought to the 7th Cavalry by Brevet Colonel Myles W. Keogh and other officers with relations to the Fifth Royal Irish Lancers and the Papal Guard. As the story goes, it was the last song played for Custer's men as they left General Terry's column at the Powder River. The 7th Cavalry became a part of the 1st Cavalry Division during 1921. The word \\"Garryowen\\" was used often during the Vietnam War by soldiers of First Cavalry as a password to identify each other. It became the official tune of the division during 1981.\\"The Legend of Gary Owen\\", The 7th U.S. Cavalry Association, June 27, 2016 The name of the tune has become a part of the regiment, the words Garry Owen are part of the regimental crest. The tune became the name for bases established by the Cavalry in current conflicts. The most recent was Contingency Operating Station, (COS), Garryowen in the Maysan Province of Iraq.Brown, Alan S., \\"Soldiers take lead in supporting COS GARRYOWEN\\", US Army.

This Italian use is limited to the verse tune of \\"Garryowen\\" (omitting the chorus), and it has several different sets of traditional lyrics ‚Äì all starting with the title line ‚Äì including some bawdy ones. It was popularised by its use at the end of the comedy film I pompieri (1985) and its sequel I pompieri 2: Missione eroica (1987), both about a team of comically inept firefighters from all over Italy (played by Lino Banfi from Apulia, Christian De Sica from Rome, Paolo Villaggio from Genoa, Massimo Boldi and Teo Teocoli ‚Äì the last two both from Lombardy, although Teocoli was born in Taranto). * The Space: Above and Beyond episode \\"Pearly\\" features a tank driver named Sergeant Fox identified as being from the 7th Cavalry, who sings \\"Garryowen\\" in battle at the beginning of the episode. *Proper name of Slim Picken's (Louis Burton Lindley, Jr.) character in the Cheyenne episode 'Big Ghost Basin'. *In James Joyce's Ulysses, the Citizen's dog in the Cyclops episode at Kieran's pub was named Garryowen. *The final (third) movement of \\"D.W.

Current technology for creating such very high-resolution images usually involves either making digital image mosaics of many high-resolution digital photographs or using a film negative as large as 12\\" √ó 9\\" (30 cm √ó 23 cm) up to 18\\" √ó 9\\" (46 cm √ó 23 cm), which is then scanned with a high-end large- format film scanner with at least 3000 dpi resolution. Only a few cameras are capable of creating a gigapixel image in a single sweep of a scene, such as the Pan-STARRS PS1 and the Gigapxl Camera. A gigamacro image is a gigapixel image which is a close-up or macro image. Terapixel A terapixel image is an image composed of one trillion (1012) pixels. Though currently rare, there have been a few instances such as the Microsoft Research Terapixel project for use on the Fulldome projection system, a composite of medical images by Aperio, and Google Earth's Landsat images viewable as a time-lapse are collectively considered over one terapixel. In 2015 the 'Terabite', the world's first terapixel macro image, was released by GIGAmacro.

It ran aground off Unalaska Island in western Alaska's Aleutian Islands on 8 December 2004 after its engine failed. Six crew members died when a rescue helicopter was engulfed by a breaking wave; the ship broke in two, resulting in a large oil spill.  Final voyage  On 28 November 2004, Selendang Ayu left Seattle, Washington, bound for Xiamen, China. On board was a cargo of of soybeans, along with of fuel oil. Arrival in China was scheduled for 17 December but the ship was running at reduced speed due to high winds and heavy seas. After the ship had sailed through Unimak Pass, the ship's engine malfunctioned and was shut down, at around noon on 6 December. At this point, the ship was north- west of Bogoslof Island and around from Dutch Harbor, the nearest port. The cause of the engine failure was found to be a cracked liner in the no. 3 cylinder and the ship's engineers decided to isolate that cylinder, restart the engine using the five remaining cylinders and sail to Dutch Harbor, where the defective cylinder could be repaired. By 21:00, the no. 3 cylinder had been isolated but the engine could not be restarted. At this time, the wind was Beaufort force 8, from the north-west, and the ship was drifting towards land at about . The following morning, it was discovered that four of the engine's cylinders also had cracked piston rings. It was decided to replace the worst of these and make another attempt to restart the engine. By now, the sustained wind speed was around and the ship was drifting at in seas. At 1100, the US Coast Guard cutter arrived on scene and was standing by. The no. 6 cylinder head, weighing was removed and lashed to the deck but worsening weather and the ship's roll prevented any more work on the engine for the next 18 hours. Fuel was transferred to inboard tanks to reduce the likelihood of a spill if the ship should run aground. During the afternoon, the ship drifted past Bogoslof Island at a distance of around . The ocean-going tug Sidney Foss arrived after sunset at 18:30 and a line was attached. However, with winds now at and waves of , the tug was only able to slow the vessel's drift. A second tug, James Dunlap was hired from Dutch Harbor, with the intention of attaching it to Selendang Ayus stern so it could be turned to face into the wind, allowing it to be towed away from Unalaska Island. However, soon after James Dunlap arrived, the tow-line from Sidney Foss parted at 07:30 on 8 December and the weather made it impossible to re-establish the tow. At 11:15, the ship passed into water shallow enough for its anchors to be used. One anchor was dropped and this halted the ship for around an hour, until the wind worsened and the ship began to drift towards the shore again. The starboard anchor could not be lowered as the port anchor had wrapped around the bow of the ship. Alex Haley tried to attach a towline to turn the ship and allow the second anchor to be dropped but this also failed.  Rescue  Two HH-60J Jayhawk helicopters had been sent from Coast Guard Air Station Kodiak to Cold Bay to rescue Selendang Ayus crew, if necessary. At 14:00 on 8 December, the first of these helicopters began to winch nine of the ship's crew from the deck and, 50 minutes later, began to lower them to the deck of Alex Haley while the second Jayhawk began to pick up nine more crew members and transferred them ashore. This left seven senior officers and one deck cadet on board the ship, which had now managed to lower its starboard anchor. Work on the engine continued but the ship ran aground at 1705. One of the Jayhawks returned to evacuate the remaining crew and, by 18:15, only the master and a Coast Guard rescue swimmer were still to be lifted off the ship. A rogue wave broke over the ship's bow and the helicopter was engulfed in spray. Its engines flamed out from water ingestion and the helicopter crashed into the sea and sank. Alex Haleys HH-65B Dolphin was airborne and was able to rescue the three members of the Jayhawk's crew but only one of the seven members of the ship's crew. There was no sign of the remaining six men so the Dolphin took the rescued crew ashore. At 19:15, Selendang Ayu broke in two; the master and the Coast Guard swimmer were safely recovered at 20:35. The crew of the Dolphin helicopter, CGNR 6513, were later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for their actions. The Coast Guard searched unsuccessfully for the remaining crew until their efforts were called off on 10 December.  Impact  The ship had been carrying a significant amount of fuel, so there were fears that Selendang Ayu could create the worst Alaskan oil spill since Exxon Valdez. One tank containing of fuel ruptured when the ship broke apart. It is estimated that of heavy bunker C fuel oil and of diesel fuel was on board when she grounded. Ultimately, of bunker oil and diesel spilled, which is about 2.9% of the volume of crude oil spilled from Exxon Valdez. The crew had transferred the fuel internal tanks when the ship foundered, and heaters were turned off so that the fuel would thicken in the cold waters. However, environmental officials estimate that up to 1.28 million liters of thick fuel oil () leaked from the freighter. The carcasses of over 1,600 birds and 6 sea otters were recovered from beaches along the western shore of Unalaska Island after the spill.

Suggestions and submissions  Up to 1892, suggestions were being made as to what the state's coat of arms was to constitute and the pictures below illustrate the four main depictions that were considered. Below are the four proposed coat of arms submitted to the British College of Arms and from which the first edition of the coat of arms was taken. These suggestions were accompanied by a letter by the Chief Secretary to the Government Office in London.Queensland State Archives (1892) 'Despatches Written By The Agent General', SRS 5321, 1, 75 Image:QLDCoatofArms1.jpgFirst example of a proposed coat of arms for Queensland Image:QLDCoatofArms2.jpgSecond example of a proposed coat of arms for Queensland Image:QLDCoatofArms3.jpgThird example of a proposed coat of arms for Queensland Image:QLDCoatofArms4.jpgFourth example of a proposed coat of arms for Queensland  Heraldic description  Coat of Arms of Queensland, 1893 Below is the blazon: > 'Per fesse, the Chief Or, the Base per pale Sable and Gules, in chief a > Bull's head couped in profile muzzled, and a merino Ram's head respecting > each other proper, the dexter charged with a Garb of the first, and in the > sinister Base on a mount a Pile of Quartz, issuant there from a Gold > Pyramid, in front of the Mount a Spade surmounted by a Pick saltire-wise all > proper'Queensland Government (1997) 'Badge, Arms, Floral and other Emblems > of Queensland Act 1959', www.legislation.qld.gov.au, [26 May 2004] Modernised, this means: > 'Across the top of the shield a gold panel on which there is a bull's head > in profile muzzled, cut off at the neck and a merino ram's head, facing each > other, both naturally coloured.

In 1902 the heraldic depiction of the British Imperial Crown was standardised to the (symbolic) Tudor Crown. Following 1953, this was switched to a depiction of the actual St. Edward's Crown. The final and current addition to the coat of arms was created in 1977, during the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, with the granting of supporting animal. A red deer, to represent the old world and it is a classic animal of heraldry; and a brolga, which represents the native population and it is the state's official bird.Hartemink, Ralf (1997) 'Queensland Coat of Arms', http://www.ngw.nl/indexgb.htm, [20 March 2004]  Industrial influence The symbols on the shield are representations of Queensland's most abundant industries. The wheat industry's origins belong with the first settlers in 1788, as the farms were worked by the convicts brought over from England, an idea of Governor Phillip.Dunsdorfs, Edgars (1956) 'The Australian Wheat Growing Industry 1788‚Äì1948', University Press, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, pp6 During the years till 1795, the wheat industry slowly gained popularity and by the late 19th century was a strong force in the agricultural industry of the state. The sugar industry became established by 1868 in Mackay which was a mere four years after the first commercial sugar mill was opened in Cleveland, south of Brisbane.Kerr, John (1988) 'A Century of Sugar', Watson Ferguson, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, pp10 Sugar and Coffee regulations were brought in by Parliament later that year as the industry spread rapidly and with the creation of the Mackay Central Sugar Mill Manufacturing Company ten years later in 1878, the sugar industry had reached its colonial peak.Kerr, John (1988) 'A Century of Sugar', ibid., pp16 The sheep industry had been in existence since the early 1820s within Australia and by the early 1880s the geographical expansion of this industry had hit Queensland in which major wool auctions were held throughout the state.Ville, Simon (2000) 'The Rural Entrepreneurs', Cambridge University Press, Victoria, Australia, pp42 The mining industry began with the discovery of copper on 20 May 1867 by Ernest Henry in Cloncurry and the industry climbed with the Gold Rush which occurred on 3 September 1873 when gold was discovered in Georgetown.Carroll, Brian (1977) 'Australia's Mines and Miners', Macmillan Publishing, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, pp30 The beef industry was quite prevalent by the late 1880s and by 1890, Queensland had exported Australia's first major export overseas which consisted of 1500 tons and by the 20th century that number had exploded to 43000 tons.Kelly, JH (1971) 'Beef in Northern Australia', Australian National University Press, Canberra, Australia, pp11  Supporting animals  As for the supporting animals, the brolga is Australia's only native crane and is described as \\"more than a metre tall and their outstretched wings can measure two metres across. The adults are mainly grey and have a long thin neck, a bare head and a patch of striking red coloured skin on the lower part of the head below the eyes\\".Federal Government (2002) ' Australian Symbols', McPherson's Printing Group, Canberra, Australia, pp33 They are mostly found along the coast from Rockhampton to the Gulf of Carpentaria and have featured on the coat of arms since 1977 and has been the state bird since 1986. The red deer has a more regal origin; along with being a traditional and classic beast of heraldry, Queen Victoria gave the newly created colony a herd of deer from the royal hunting ground‚Äîhence their inclusion upon the arms.Federal Government (2002) ' Australian Symbols', McPherson's Printing Group, Canberra, Australia, pp31  Maltese Cross  The Maltese cross has a stranger history than the rest of the elements upon the arms. Not even the Queensland government is aware of why the Maltese Cross was chosen for the coat of arms, as described in the letter below which resides in the Queensland State Archives.Queensland State Archives (1966) 'Flag, Badge, Arms and Seal of Queensland', SRS1043, 1, 267, 84  Official coat of arms  Below is a visual evolution of the Queensland coat of arms.

The refuge stretches from Cape Lisburne on the Chukchi Sea to the tip of the Aleutian Islands in the west and Forrester Island in the southern Alaska Panhandle region in the east. The refuge has diverse landforms and terrains, including tundra, rainforest, cliffs, volcanoes, beaches, lakes, and streams. Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge is well known for its abundance of seabirds. About 75 percent of Alaskan native marine birds, 15 to 30 million among 55 species, use the refuge. AMNWR also provides a nesting habitat for an estimated 40 million seabirds, representing 80 percent of all seabirds in North America. The birds congregate in \\"bird cities\\" (colonies) along the coast. Each species has a specialized nesting site (rock ledge, crevice, boulder rubble, pinnacle, or burrow). Other animals present in this refuge include caribou, sea lions, bears, coyotes, seals, Canadian lynxes, beavers, foxes, muskrats, wolf packs, moose, walrus, river otters, marten, whales, Dall sheep and sea otters. The administrative headquarters and visitor center are located in Homer, Alaska.

According to comments from the author, Bruce Coville, the first Space Brat story version was written in 1977. He intended to make it a picture book, and his wife (Katherine Coville) even drew a few sample illustrations. The editor disagreed with this idea, however, saying he \\"didn't think kids would be interested in reading about a noseless green humanoid from outer space.\\" Ironically, this was a few years before Steven Spielberg's movie E.T. was released. The series revolves around the adventures of young Blork, an alien who got labeled a brat after he hatched because a piece of his eggshell got stuck behind his ear and he would not stop crying. Because he was labeled a brat, people come to think of him as one. As a result, he was always getting blamed for things, even if they weren't his fault. As he grew older, Blork decided to use this to his advantage. Blork's best friend and constant companion is his poodnoobie, Lunk, who hatched late from his egg and is not the brightest animal in the galaxy.

A saved game (also called a game save, savegame, savefile, save point, or simply save) is a piece of digitally stored information about the progress of a player in a video game. From the earliest games in the 1970s onward, game platform hardware and memory improved, which led to bigger and more complex computer games, which, in turn, tended to take more and more time to play them from start to finish. This naturally led to the need to store in some way the progress, and how to handle the case where the player received a \\"game over\\". More modern games with a heavier emphasis on storytelling are designed to allow the player many choices that impact the story in a profound way later on, and some game designers do not want to allow more than one save game so that the experience will always be \\"fresh\\". Game designers allow players to prevent the loss of progress in the game (as might happen after a game over). Games designed this way encourage players to 'try things out', and on regretting a choice, continue from an earlier point on. Although the feature of save games often allows for gameplay to resume after a game over, a notable exception is in games where save games are deleted when it is game over. Several names are used to describe this feature, including \\"permadeath\\", \\"iron man\\", and \\"hardcore\\", and the feature has developed over the years from being the only kind of save system per game to the more modern 'suspend game' feature among regular save points. For online games, the game's progress is maintained on the remote server. In some games, upon resuming the game from a save game, the software locks or marks the save game. Early examples include Moria and Diablo II \\"hardcore\\" mode where the character save game is managed by the server. The use of saved games is very common in modern video games, particularly in role-playing video games, which are usually much too long to finish in a single session. History and overview In early video games, there was no need for saving games, since these games usually had no actual plot to develop and were generally very short in length. The relative complexity and inconvenience of storing game state information on early home computers (and the fact that early video game consoles had no non-volatile data storage) meant that initially game saves were represented as \\"passwords\\" (often strings of characters that encoded the game state) that players could write down and later input into the game when resuming. BYTE magazine stated in 1981, regarding the computer text adventure Zork Is save game feature, that \\"While some cowards use it to retain their hard-earned position in the game before making some dangerous move\\", it was intended to let players play over many weeks. InfoWorld disagreed that year, stating that save games \\"allow users to experiment with different approaches to the same situation\\". Home computers in the early 1980s had the advantage of using external media for saving, with compact cassettes and floppy disks, before finally using internal hard drives. On later cartridge-based console games, such as Kirby's Adventure and The Legend of Zelda, saved games were stored in battery-backed RAM on the game cartridge itself. The Legend of Zelda was the first ever game to allow saving on console. In recent consoles, which use disc-based media for storing games, saved games are stored in other ways, such as by use of memory cards or internal hard drives on the game machine itself. Some games do not save the player's progress towards completing the game, but rather high scores, custom settings, and other features. The first game to save the player's score was Taito's seminal 1978 shoot 'em up title Space Invaders. Depending on the game, a player will have the ability to save the game either at any arbitrary point (usually when the game has been paused), after a specific task has been completed (such as at the end of a level), or at designated areas within the game known as save points. The available ways to save a game affect gameplay, and can represent a practice of players or an explicit decision by designers to give the game a particular feel or alter its difficulty. Time and location of saving A video game may allow the user to save at any point of the game at any time. There are also modified versions of this. For example, in the GameCube game Eternal Darkness, the player can save at almost any time, but only if no enemies are in the room. To make gaming more engaging, some video games may impose a limit on the number of times a player saves the game. For instance, IGI 2 allows only a handful of saves in each mission; Max Payne 2 imposes this restriction on the highest level of difficulty. Some video games only allow the game to be saved at predetermined points in the game, called save points. (Not to be confused by \\"checkpoints\\".) Save points are employed either because the game is too complex to allow saving at any given point or to attempt to make the game more engaging by forcing the player to rely on skills instead of on the ability to retry indefinitely. Save points are also far easier to program, so when a game developer has to rush a game, save points are attractive to develop. Some games use a hybrid system where both save anywhere and save points are used. For example, Final Fantasy VII permits saving anywhere when the player is traveling on the world map, but once the player enters a location (e.g. town, cavern or forest), saving is only possible at save points. Additionally, there is one location (called the Northern Crater) in which the player is allowed to deploy one save point in a spot of their choice. =Savescumming= Overusing saved games is seen by some as cheating and in such a context referred to as savescumming. Savescumming makes losing a game impossible because whenever the player loses or is about to lose, a savegame is loaded, effectively turning back time to the situation before the loss. In a video game, this could for example be done when a battle is lost, the player didn't win a race, forgot to grab a parachute before jumping out of a plane or lost a bet. For example, in a game that features a casino, the player could save the game and then bet all their in-game money on black at the roulette table. If the outcome is black, their money is doubled and the player saves the game again. If the outcome is red (or green), the player disregards this outcome by reloading their last savegame. This allows for an indefinite winning streak. In the movie Next, the protagonist is able to see 2 minutes into the future, allowing him to evaluate dozens of possible outcomes for any encounter. His power is very similar to savescumming. Types of saved games =Autosave= Game saving does not need to be manual. Some video games save the game in progress automatically, such as at the start of each level, after the pass of a fixed amount of time (if saving anywhere is allowed), at certain predetermined points in the game (an extension to save point concept), or when the player leaves (the game saves when you stop playing). Some games only permit suspend saves in which the game is automatically saved upon exiting and reloaded upon restarting. The aim of a suspend save is only to allow the gameplay to be temporarily interrupted; as such, suspend saves are erased when the player resumes the game. The act of copying and reusing suspend save files is a form of cheating. =Checkpoints= Tux passes a checkpoint (the yellow bell) in the video game SuperTux Checkpoints are locations in a video game where a player character respawns after death. Characters generally respawn at the last checkpoint that they have reached. A respawn is most often due to the death of the in-game character, but it can also be caused by the failure to meet an objective required to advance in the game. Checkpoints might be temporary, as they stop working when the character loses all of its lives. Most modern games, however, save the game to memory at these points, known as auto-saving. Checkpoints might be visible or invisible to the player. Visible checkpoints might give a player a sense of security when activated, but in turn sacrifice some immersion, as checkpoints are intrinsically \\"gamey\\" and might even need an explanation of how they work. Invisible checkpoints do not break immersion but make players unsure of where they will respawn. Usually, if a player does get a game over, then their progress will be lost, and the player would lose all of their checkpoints. =Quick saving= Quick saving and quick loading allow the player to save or load the game with a single keystroke. These terms are used to differentiate between the traditional saving mechanism where the player is required to invoke a menu or dialog box, issue save the order, specify a title for the game being saved and, if applicable, confirm whether an old saved game file with the same title should be overwritten. The term \\"quick save\\" may be used in video games that lack the traditional saving mechanism altogether. The advantage of quick saving is its low burden: The player only has to press a button and, if applicable, wait a few seconds. The disadvantage is the automatic loss of the previous quick-saved game. Games that only offer quick saving may be impossible to play by two different players (or more) unless there is a mechanism to distinguish players, such as user accounts. Leaving the decision of when to save up to the player increases the likelihood that a save will be made during a less than favourable game state. A quicksave shortly before an event which kills the player creates what is known as a death loop. =Password= Passwords are a form of saved game not stored on non-volatile memory. Instead, everything needed to reconstruct the game state is encoded in a string of text (the password) and displayed to the player, who can then record or memorize it. The player may later resume play from that point by entering the same password. Passwords are only feasible when the amount of data being saved is only a few bytes. =Save states= A save state is a form of a saved game in emulators. A save state is generated when the emulator stores the contents of random-access memory of an emulated program to disk. Save states enable players to save their games even when the emulated game or system does not support the feature. For instance, save states may be used to circumvent saving restrictions or to abuse RNG. An associated concept is save state hacking, the practice of altering the save states to alter gameplay conditions, usually in favor of the player. Save states are comparable to snapshots of a computer system's state or hibernation in computing, with save states being a limited form of snapshots. Save states have started to receive mainstream usage in the early 2010s with Nintendo's Virtual Console. Some Wii U and 3DS Virtual Console titles allow players to save a restore point, which is like a quick save but has no restrictions on reloading. Although likely derived from quick saves, restore points are functionally identical to save states, and can be used for many of the same purposes. Presentation Game designers often attempt to integrate the save points into the style of the game using skeuomorphism. Resident Evil represents save points with old fashioned typewriters (which require an ink ribbon item for each save), the Grand Theft Auto series used representations appropriate to the era of the setting: cassette tapes for the mid-1980s (Grand Theft Auto: Vice City), 3¬Ω-inch disks for the early-1990s (Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas), and compact discs for the late-1990s (Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories). Many RPGs integrate saving into the form of a journal that the characters write into, or auto-save whenever the character stays at an inn or other resting places. Undertale implements the save game feature into the story of the game, saying that the player's ability to save is based on their \\"determination\\". Although save points are typically seen as boons, some games have traps which use this tendency to fool the player. In Chrono Trigger, attempting to use a fake save point in Magus's castle can actually bring the party into battle. In I Wanna Be The Guy, one save point is actually an enemy in disguise. Some games employ limits to saving in order to prevent players from using them as a primary means of succeeding in the game. In Tomb Raider save points are consumed upon use, Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest charges two banana coins to use a save point more than once, and in Resident Evil the player must find and expend an ink ribbon for each save. Another way saved games interact with each other is through passing along data to sequels. A famous example of this is the first three installments of the Wizardry series. To play the second and third installments, players needed to import the characters they'd used in the previous installment, which retained all experience and equipment gained in that installment. Later versions of the games made this feature optional, as do franchises such as the Fire Emblem, Shenmue and .hack series. Video games may also take the saved games of other video games into account; for example, the character Rosalina becomes available on Mario Kart Wii if there is a Super Mario Galaxy save on the console. The save game of Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition can be imported to the Remix version of the game. Save sharing For many years, sharing game saves among friends has been very common. From trading passwords to swapping memory cards, gamers have always been able to help each other out to unlock features in a game. With the growing popularity of the Internet, many people upload their game saves to help out their online friends. However, with the inclusion of a progress meter or \\"gamerscore\\" that tracks player progress in games for the Xbox 360, many players are beginning to view those who load other people's files onto their systems as \\"cheaters\\". Some games such as Grand Theft Auto IV prevent the use of saved games made by other users. The Legend of Zelda: Oracles actually encourages this with a password swapping side quest that is available after finishing the main story. Arcade games Saved games have generally been rare at arcades, but have found some use, notably in the Konami e-Amusement system, or by the use of PlayStation cards, as in Dance Dance Revolution. These generally use either a magnetic card to store the data, or network (internet) connection, or some combination thereof. Similarly, passwords have generally been rare at arcades, with occasional exceptions, such as Gauntlet Legends.

His coat of arms was S≈Ço≈Ñce. Zyndram was first mentioned in 1388 as a mayor of Jas≈Ço. He bought the post from a certain Jakusz Trzop for 100 grzywnas. He was also the Sword-bearer of the Crown. In February 1390, Zyndram took part in the military campaign against the Teutonic Order. The following year, he was yet again called to arms and took part in several battles against the Order in Lithuania and northern Poland. Zyndram was ordered to organize the defense of a nodal castle of Kamieniec Litewski, east of the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest. Probably for successfully fulfilling this task, he was promoted to the starost of Jas≈Ço. In 1409, Zyndram was called to arms by king W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço to take part in his offensive against the Teutons. During the famous Battle of Grunwald of 1410, Zyndram was the Grand Camp Leader of the Crown and commander of the Banner of Krak√≥w, composed of elite troops and holding the banner of the whole army. According to Histori√¶ Polonic√¶ by Ioannes Longinus, it was the unit commanded by Zyndram that killed the Teutonic commander, Ulrich von Jungingen. For many years, it was also believed that he was commander of all Polish troops in the battle, but recent research proved that this was but a wrong translation of Longinus' chronicle. His part in the battle was also described by Henryk Sienkiewicz in his novel The Teutonic Knights. After the campaign, Zyndram returned to his domain. In 1413, he extended his domain by renting the village of Przesiecznica from the bishop of Przemy≈õl in exchange for the defense of the area against the Tartars and bandits from the Beskids. The exact date of his death is unknown, however on June 5, 1414 his wife, Anna, was mentioned as \\"Widow of Zyndram\\".

After years of experience building kites and balloons for aerial panoramic photography, Lawrence turned to aviation design in 1910. Life The Lawrences are descended from John Philip Lorenz, who had emigrated from Germany in 1748. George was born in Ottawa, Illinois, on February 24, 1868. He was the eldest of six children of Margaret Othelia Tritley and Michael B. Lawrence. Michael was a LaSalle County farmer and a carpenter. Within a few years, the family moved sixty miles east to a Kankakee County farm. George went to school through the eighth-grade in the nearby town of Manteno, Illinois. He also attended St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church in Manteno. Around 1890, he moved to Chicago and began working at the Abbott Buggy Co. factory in Auburn, Illinois. There, he invented a method of attaching iron rims on wooden wheels. In 1890, Lawrence married Alice Herenden and they had two children: Raymond W. Lawrence and George Lee Lawrence. In 1891, he opened The Lawrence Portrait Studio at the corner of Yale Avenue and 63rd Street, sharing the space and expenses with fellow photographer Irwin W. Powell. In the mid-1890s, Lawrence perfected the use of \\"flashlight photography\\", which was the norm until flashbulbs were invented years later. In 1900, he built the world's largest camera to take a photograph of the Alton Limited Train, owned by the Chicago & Alton Railway. The camera weighed 1400 pounds (640 kg) and used a 4.5‚Ä≤ √ó 8‚Ä≤ glass-plate negative. The photograph was taken for the 1900 Exposition Universelle (Paris Exposition of 1900) in Paris, France and won \\"The Grand Prize of the World\\". He also made innovations in areas of aerial photography such as ballooning and camera‚Äìcarrying kites. San Francisco photo 1906 earthquake One of Lawrence's world-renowned photographs is of the ruins of San Francisco, California after the 1906 earthquake. It is a 160-degree panorama from a kite taken 2000 feet (600 m) in the air above the San Francisco Bay that showed the entire city on a single 17-by-48-inch contact print made from a single piece of film. Each print sold for $125 and Lawrence made at least $15,000 (US$ in ) in sales from this one photograph. The camera used in this photograph weighed 49 pounds (22 kg) and used a celluloid-film plate. In 2006, Juneau-based photographer Ronald Klein built a working replica of Lawrence's camera and used it to rephotograph San Francisco from about the same location (but from a helicopter, not a kite), 100 years after the earthquake. The rephotograph was actually taken by Mark Walsh, George R. Lawrence's great grandson, who rode in the helicopter, held the camera, and clicked the shutter. Marriage, remarriage, and death The giant camera built by Lawrence in 1900 In 1909, while he was away on an expensive and frustrating adventure attempting to take aerial photographs of wild animals in British East Africa, his wife found that he had been having an affair with one of his secretaries. Upon his return, he fled to California, taking his sons with him. He then turned from photography to aviation, building an aircraft at a factory in Chicago. He would be granted nearly a hundred patents for aviation-related devices. He divorced his first wife, Alice Herendeen, in 1913 (with whom he had had two children, Raymond Welcome Lawrence and George Lee Lawrence), and married Adele Frances \\"Della\\" Page in 1916. She was born in St. Louis, Missouri and was the daughter of Henry J. Page, an architect. George Lawrence was 48 years old and Della was 22 years old when they married. They had four daughters: Clara Antoinette, Virginia Lee, Ruth Adele, and Martha \\"Louise\\" Lawrence. Lawrence's aircraft company folded in 1919. He died in 1938, aged 70, and funeral services were held at St. Gertrude's Roman Catholic Church in Chicago. He was buried at St. Joseph's Cemetery in Manteno, Illinois. George and Della's four daughters are all deceased, but he is survived by 19 descendants: 8 grandchildren: Vincent Maggio; Michael Maggio, Donna Walsh (Clara's children); Louise Bing (Virginia's child); Thomas L.Phinney; Nan Phinney; Robert Phinney, and Carolyn R. Phinney (Louise's children); 7 great-grandchildren; and 4 great-great- grandchildren.

It is adapted to grow in dry climate locations in which few other plants can survive. It is native to warm temperate and tropical regions in southern Eurasia and Africa. It has been unintentionally introduced to North America and Australia. An aggressive and hardy invasive species, T. terrestris is widely known as a noxious weed because of its small woody fruit - the bur - having long sharp and strong spines which easily penetrate surfaces such as the bare feet or thin shoes of crop workers and other pedestrians, the rubber of bicycle tires, and the mouths and skin of grazing animals. Names Like many weedy species, this plant has numerous common names according to the world region, including goat's-head, bindii, bullhead, burra gokharu, bhakhdi, caltrop, small caltrops, cat's-head, devil's eyelashes, devil's-thorn, devil's-weed, puncture vine, and tackweed. Description habitus on a beach in the Philippines Tribulus terrestris is a taprooted herbaceous plant that grows as a summer annual in temperate climates. =Range and habitat= Native to the Mediterranean region, T. terrestris is widespread throughout the world from latitudes 35¬∞S to 47¬∞N. It is distributed across warm temperate and tropical regions of southern Europe, southern Asia, throughout Africa, New Zealand, and Australia. It is present across the United States and in Central and South America. Over the 20th century, the vine appeared in California and became distributed northward, eventually appearing in the Okanagan Valley of south- central British Columbia, Canada where it is classified as a noxious weed. A network of fine rootlets arise from the taproot to take advantage of soil moisture, by which the plant can survive in arid conditions. It grows in almost any soil, but thrives in dry, loose, sandy soils, and even in sand or in deserts. It can prosper in heavier soils, especially if fertile or moist, and on compacted soils along roadsides. =Growth pattern= The stems radiate from the crown to a diameter of about to over , often branching. They are usually prostrate, forming flat patches, though they may grow more upwards in shade or among taller plants. =Leaves and stem= \\"Goathead\\" fruit Germinating fruit of Tribulus terrestris Dried Tribulus terrestris burs Stems branch from the crown and are densely hairy. Leaves are opposite and pinnately compound. Densely hairy leaflets are opposite and up to long. =Inflorescence= The flowers are wide, with five lemon-yellow petals, five sepals, and ten stamens. In Southern California, it blooms from April through October, where it is highly invasive in waste places and disturbed sites. =Fruit= Thumbtack-like Tribulus terrestris burs are a hazard to bare feet and bicycle tires. After the flower blooms, a fruit develops that easily falls apart into five burs. The burs are hard and bear two to four sharp spines, long and broad point-to-point. These burs strikingly resemble goats' or bulls' heads, characteristics which give the bur its common names in some regions.Tribulus terrestris in BoDD - Botanical Dermatology Database The \\"horns\\" are sharp enough to puncture bicycle tires and other air-filled tires. They can also cause painful injury to bare feet and can injure the mouths of livestock grazing on the plant. Within each bur, seeds are stacked on top of each other, separated by a hard membrane. As an adaptation to dry climates, the largest seed germinates first, while the others may wait until more moisture is available before germinating. The bur spines point upward, where they stick into feet and fur of animals, serving the purpose of seed dispersal. This causes damage to domesticated livestock and degrades wool. Tribulus terrestris burs in foot, Marfa, Texas Etymology The Greek word, œÑœÅŒØŒ≤ŒøŒªŒøœÇ meaning 'water-chestnut', translated into Latin as tribulos. The Latin name tribulus originally meant the caltrop (a spiky weapon), but in Classical times already the word meant this plant as well.Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, A Latin Dictionary Cultivation and uses The plant is widely naturalized in the Americas and also in Australia south of its native range. In some states in the United States, it is considered a noxious weed and an invasive species. It is a declared plant (infestations described under \\"caltrop\\") in South Australia. The leaves and shoots are eaten in East Asia. The stems have been used as a thickener, added to diluted buttermilk to give it the appearance of undiluted buttermilk. =Traditional Chinese medicine= In traditional Chinese medicine, Tribulus terrestris is known as baijili (ÁôΩËí∫Ëóú) or cijili (Âà∫Ëí∫Ëóú): =Dietary supplement= Although its extract is used as a dietary supplement with the belief that it increases testosterone levels mainly for body-builders, T. terrestris failed to increase testosterone levels in controlled studies, and has not been proven to be safe. There is no evidence it has strength-enhancing properties, or anabolic steroid effects for use as a body-building supplement. Eradication Ground covered in Tribulus terrestris Where this is a non-indigenous species, eradication methods are often sought. There are both biological and herbicidal solutions to the problem, but none of them provide a solution that is both quick and long- lasting, because T. terrestris seeds remain viable for up to seven years on average. =Physical= In smaller areas, T. terrestris is best controlled with manual removal, using a hoe to cut the plant off at its taproot. While this is effective, removing the entire plant by gripping the taproot, stem or trunk and pulling upward to remove the taproot is far more effective. This requires monitoring the area and removing the weed throughout the preseeding time (late spring and early summer in many temperate areas). This will greatly reduce the prevalence of the weed the following year. Mowing is not an effective method of eradication, because the plant grows flat against the ground. Another avenue of physical eradication is to crowd out the opportunistic weed by providing good competition from favorable plants. Aerating compacted sites and planting competitive desirable plants, including broad-leaved grasses such as St. Augustine, can reduce the effect of T. terrestris by reducing resources available to the weed. In June 2014, the town of Irrigon, Oregon, announced it would pay a bounty of one dollar for each large trash bag of puncturevine. =Chemical= Chemical control is generally recommended for home control of T. terrestris. There are few pre-emergent herbicides that are effective. Products containing oryzalin, benefin, or trifluralin will provide partial control of germinating seeds. These must be applied prior to germination (late winter to midspring). After plants have emerged from the soil (postemergent), products containing 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), glyphosate, and dicamba are effective on T. terrestris. Like most postemergents, they are more effectively maintained when caught small and young. Dicamba and 2,4-D will cause harm to most broad-leaved plants, so the user should take care to avoid over- application. They can be applied to lawns without injuring the desired grass. Glyphosate will kill or injure most plants, so it should only be used as a spot treatment or on solid stands of the weed. A product from DuPont called Pastora is highly effective but expensive and not for lawn use. =Biological= Two weevils, Microlarinus lareynii and M. lypriformis, native to India, France, and Italy, were introduced into the United States as biocontrol agents in 1961. Both species of weevils are available for purchase from biological suppliers, but purchase and release is not often recommended because weevils collected from other areas may not survive at the purchaser's location. Microlarinus lareynii is a seed weevil that deposits its eggs in the young burr or flower bud. The larvae feed on and destroy the seeds before they pupate, emerge, disperse, and start the cycle over again. Its life cycle time is 19 to 24 days. Microlarinus lypriformis is a stem weevil that has a similar life cycle, excepting the location of the eggs, which includes the undersides of stems, branches, and the root crown. The larvae tunnel in the pith where they feed and pupate. Adults of both species overwinter in plant debris. Although the stem weevil is slightly more effective than the seed weevil when each is used alone, the weevils are most effective if used together and the T. terrestris plant is moisture-stressed. Toxicity Toxic compounds in the plant are known to cause liver damage when ingested at harmful dosages. When ingested, phylloerythrin accumulates in the blood as a byproduct of chlorophyl degradation; however, adverse reactions have not been confirmed in humans. In sheep, consumption of T. terrestris causes tribulosis, also known as 'geeldikkop', which is a type of photodermatitis. Phytochemistry The phytochemistry of T. terrestris samples collected from various parts of the world differs significantly. Among the steroidal saponins present in this herb, furostanol saponins are isolated only from T. terrestris of Bulgarian origin. One of the main chemical compounds found in T. terrestris is protodioscin. Two alkaloids that seem to cause limb paresis (staggers) in sheep that eat Tribulus terrestulis are the beta-carboline alkaloids harman (harmane) and norharman (norharmane). The alkaloid content of dried foliage is about 44 mg/kg.

He was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves of Nazi Germany. World War I and interwar years Heinrich Eberbach was born on 24 November 1895 in Stuttgart, in the German Empire. Eberbach graduated with his Abitur (university-preparatory high school diploma) on 30 June 1914. On 1 July 1914, Eberbach joined the Army of W√ºrttemberg. With the outbreak of World War I, Eberbach's unit was deployed on the Western Front. On 16 October 1914, Eberbach was wounded in his thigh by artillery shrapnel. In September 1915, Eberbach was severely wounded, losing his nose, and was taken prisoner of war by French forces. During the 1920s Eberbach was a police officer; in 1935 he joined the Wehrmacht. In 1938 Eberbach became commander of a Panzer regiment, in the newly formed 4th Panzer Division under General Georg-Hans Reinhardt. World War II Eberbach participated in the German Invasion of Poland in September 1939 and then in 1940 in the Battle of France. His unit supported General Hasso von Manteuffel's offensive across the Meuse River in May. Shortly after the start of Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, he was assigned as commander of the 5th Panzer Brigade in Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg's XXIV Panzer Corps. During the Battle of Moscow, Eberbach spearheaded Panzer Group 2's offensive towards Moscow as the commander of a combined-arms kampfgruppe within the 4th Panzer Division. The attack began on September 30 and in only two days of fighting Kampfgruppe Eberbach had achieved a clean breakthrough, advanced over 120 kilometers, and put the entire Soviet Bryansk Front in a disastrous position while suffering negligible losses of its own. Eberbach demonstrated his flexibility as a troop leader by detaching two battalions to assist the 3rd Panzer Division's efforts in the same area of operations near Bryansk, despite serving under a different division. Soviet air attacks and a fuel shortage early on 2 October failed to prevent the kampfgruppe's aggressive combat leaders from advancing on the city of Orel, ending the Soviet industrial relocation efforts there and capturing a key communications hub of the Bryansk Front, on 3 October. Kampfgruppe Eberbach's losses had been light: 6 tanks knocked out, 34 men killed and 121 wounded. This was a small price to pay for the complete rupturing of the Soviet lines and the capture of a city of such strategic value. 4th Panzer division had also captured 1,600 Soviet troops, mostly Kampfgruppe Eberbach's work. In March 1942 he was made commander of the 4th Panzer Division, in the German lines opposite the Russian town of Sukhinichi, roughly 120 miles west of Tula. In late November 1942 Eberbach was appointed commander of the XLVIII Panzer Corps that had just been overrun in the initial days of Operation Uranus, near the midpoint of the Battle of Stalingrad. Eberbach was soon wounded and evacuated, remaining hospitalized until February. He then became Inspector of the Armored Troops in the Home Army, was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and promoted to lieutenant general. In November 1943, Eberbach became commander of troops around Nikopol and fought in battles around Zhitomir in the Soviet Union. In early 1944 Eberbach was promoted to the rank of General der Panzertruppe. During the Allied invasion of Normandy, he fought against the British landings along the 'Juno' and 'Sword' beaches. On 2 July he took command of \\"Panzer Group West\\" (5th Panzer Army) when Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg was wounded. On 9 August, this force was divided, with 5th Panzer Army retreating with the most damaged units; the effective units were reorganized as Panzergruppe Eberbach. Eberbach was directed to lead this force in the counterattack through Mortain toward Avranches that was intended to cut off the Allied forces which had broken out of Normandy. According to Eberbach's post-war memoirs, he had no confidence in the attack. When General Warlimont of OKW arrived at his HQ on 1 August to \\"get a closer look at the situation\\", Eberbach told him that \\"the only possible solution was an immediate retreat to the Seine-Yonne line.\\" However, Warlimont denied Eberbach's request to withdraw, and instead confirmed the order to attack. The attack failed, and most of Panzergruppe Eberbach and 7th Army was surrounded and destroyed in the Falaise Pocket. Eberbach escaped and was given command of the remnants of 7th Army on 21 August. On 31 August while out on a reconnaissance patrol, Eberbach was captured by British troops at Amiens. Post World War II At Trent Park POW camp. Eberbach was held in a prisoner-of-war camp until 1948. Gersdorff participated in the work of the U.S. Army Historical Division, where, under the guidance of Franz Halder, German generals wrote World War II operational studies for the U.S. Army, first as POWs and then as employees. Eberbach was the father of the naval officer Heinz-Eugen Eberbach, commander of and during World War II.

Parks in Chicago include open spaces and facilities, developed and managed by the Chicago Park District. The City of Chicago devotes 8.5% of its total land acreage to parkland, which ranked it 13th among high-density population cities in the United States in 2012. Since the 1830s, the official motto of Chicago has been Urbs in horto, Latin for \\"City in a garden\\" for its commitment to parkland.http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/about-us/history/ In addition to serving residents, a number of these parks also double as tourist destinations, most notably Lincoln Park, Chicago's largest park, visited by over 20 million people each year, is one of the most visited parks in the United States. Notable architects, artists and landscape architects have contributed to the 570 parks, including Daniel Burnham, Frederick Law Olmsted, Jens Jensen, Dwight Perkins, Frank Gehry, and Lorado Taft. History In 1836, a year before Chicago was incorporated,Macaluso, pp. 12‚Äì13 the Board of Canal Commissioners held public auctions for the city's first lots. Foresighted citizens, who wanted the Lake Michigan lakefront kept as public open space, convinced the commissioners to designate two lots as public area. The land east of Michigan Avenue between Madison Street and Park Row (11th Street) was designated \\"Public Ground‚ÄîA Common to Remain Forever Open, Clear and Free of Any Buildings, or Other Obstruction, whatever.\\" This lot was soon expanded to Randolph Street, and it was officially named Lake Park in 1847.Gilfoyle, pp. 3‚Äì4 It was renamed Grant Park in 1901. A second parcel, west of Michigan Avenue between Randolph and Washington Streets, was designated Dearborn Park. As Chicago grew, demand increased for public spaces, but the Chicago Common Council did little to address these requests. Instead, real estate investors realized that small public squares could increase the value of their property. In 1842, Washington Square Park became the first of these ventures, developed by the American Land Company. Similar projects were completed with Goudy Square Park in 1847 and Union Park in 1853. Although the Cook County Court agreed to allocate a major park on the South Side in 1857, these plans were rescinded two years later, and public outcry continued. Chicago's second large-scale allocation of parkland came in 1860, when a large section of the City Cemetery was re-designated as a park. This was due to concerns led by John Henry Rauch about the possible public health impact of having a large cemetery on the lake. This new park was also named Lake Park; however, due to confusion over its name, it was renamed to Lincoln Park in 1865, in honor of the recently deceased President. Slowly, all of the graves were moved from the cemetery, greatly expanding the park. An 1886 map detailing the system of parks and boulevards that would circle the city. Haussmann's renovation of Paris and New York's Greensward Plan in the 1850s and 1860s turned new attention to the role that parks can play in urban development. William Butler Ogden, the first mayor of Chicago, advocated for a state bill to create a large park on the South Side. Although initially rejected when proposed in 1868, the Illinois legislature accepted this plan in 1869. The objective was to create a system of parks and boulevards that would form a circle around Chicago. In 1891, J. Frank Foster became the superintendent of the south Chicago park system. He advocated the spreading out of parks into working-class neighborhoods. These generally smaller parks would nonetheless be filled with playing fields and other facilities particularly 'field house' buildings. These facilities would provide all manner of recreation space and services to people of the surrounding neighborhoods. Olmstead's sons, Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. and John Charles Olmsted, designed many of the early neighborhood parks, and these ideas for neighborhood parks influenced national ideas of park design and programming. Facilities The Chicago Park District manages 220 facilities in 570 parks covering more than of land throughout the city. This extensive network of parks also includes nine lakefront harbors over of lakefront, rendering the Chicago Park District the nation's largest municipal harbor system, along with 31 beaches, 17 historic lagoons, 86 pools, 90 playgrounds, 90 gardens, 66 fitness centers, nine ice skating rinks, 10 museums, a zoological park, and two plant conservatories. Chicago Park District Park Boundaries The Chicago Park District also maintains many special use facilities for activities such as golfing, boating, boxing, skating and baseball, as well as a number of specialty parks devoted entirely to dogs. In addition to maintaining its parks and facilities, the Chicago Park District holds thousands of community, holiday, nature, sports, music, arts, and cultural events and festivals for city residents every year, many featuring performances and workshops provided by nationally recognized \\"Arts Partners\\" such as the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and \\"Arts Partners in Residence\\" such as the Citywide Symphony Orchestra, the Albany Park Theater Project, Beacon Street Gallery and Theater, Billy Goat Experimental Theatre Company, Chicago Dance Medium, Chicago Moving Company, Chicago Swordplay Guild, Free Street Programs, K-Theory, Kuumba Lynx, The Peace Museum, Pros Arts Studio, the Puerto Rican Arts Alliance, and the Zephyr Dance Company. The height of these events are during the summer months at the height of the tourist season while children are out of school for summer recess. Architecture The dominant theme in many of Chicago's park fieldhouses are variants of either Georgian or Classical Revival architecture. Clarence Hatzfeld designed more of these fieldhouses than any other architect, as well as many of the homes in Chicago's landmark Villa District. Similar to other areas of Chicago's built environment, a sizeable number of structures in Chicago's Parks are of exceptional architectural value. Portage Park and Jefferson Park are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and some like Pulaski Park are official landmarks of the City of Chicago. Forest preserves The green-space afforded by Chicago's parks is supplemented by the Cook County Forest Preserves, a separately administered network of open spaces containing forest, prairie, wetland, streams, and lakes, that are set aside as natural areas along the city's periphery. List of parks The southwestern entrance into Portage Park at the intersection of Irving Park Rd. and Central Ave. Buckingham Fountain, donated to Chicago in 1927 by Kate Buckingham Kosciuszko Park is located by the intersection of Diversey and Pulaski.

It tells the story of six misfit children who volunteer to star in their town's Sunday school Christmas pageant, and end up teaching the town the true meaning of Christmas.  Story  The book is narrated in first person perspective by the (unnamed) daughter of the pageant's director. The six Herdman children - Imogene, Ralph, Claude, Leroy, Ollie, and Gladys - are juvenile delinquents notorious for their rowdy misfit behavior, including cigar smoking, cussing, drinking jug wine, and shoplifting. Despite their poor performance, the Herdmans steadily pass through elementary school (since holding any one of them back would mean having two or more of them in the same grade). They go to Sunday school for the first time after being told that the church offers snacks. The narrator's mother is flabbergasted when they all volunteer for the lead roles in the Christmas pageant: Mary (Imogene), Joseph (Ralph), the Three Wise Men (Claude, Ollie, and Leroy), and the Angel of the Lord (Gladys), the last of whom likens her role to a character from Amazing Comics. Since they've bullied all the usual cast members into remaining silent during the call for volunteers, the director has no choice but to cast them. Having never heard the Christmas story before, the Herdmans take an uncharacteristic interest, through which the narrator is surprised to find herself, and her parents, thinking more seriously about the story's harsher aspects: e.g., that the innkeeper forced a pregnant woman and her baby to sleep in a barn, and the Holy Family were on the run from King Herod, who wanted the baby Jesus killed. Everyone in town is expecting the Christmas pageant to be a disaster, but the Herdmans' unconventional performances actually make the whole show much more realistic and moving: instead of walking on and off stage like actors, the Herdmans are a little uncertain about where to go and what to do, as the real-life Holy Family and Wise Men must have been; instead of laying the doll representing Jesus in the manger, Imogene insists on holding it, as if it is really her child; the Wise Men choose to bring the baby Jesus a ham from the Herdmans' own gift basket instead of the \\"crummy\\" frankincense and myrhh from the story; the shepherds are sufficiently terrified of Gladys to look authentically awed by her announcement of Jesus's birth; and during the final scene, the narrator looks over from the choir and is thunderstruck to see Imogene weeping softly while hugging the \\"baby\\". By common agreement, it is the best Christmas pageant the town has ever had.  Literary Influences  In its amiable combination of farce and spirituality, the story appears to be a modern-day reimagining of the medieval Second Shepherds' Play, the surname \\"Herdman\\" being a thinly disguised synonym of \\"Shepherd.\\"  Publication and Reception  Robinson first published the story in McCall's magazine before it was adapted into a book, which sold over 800,000 copies. Stage and Screen Adaptations The book was adapted by Robinson into a play which was first performed on November 26, 1982 by the Seattle Children's Theatre.Playscript of The best Christmas pageant ever By Barbara Robinson \\"The Best Christmas Pageant Ever\\" is a play performed annually for over 20 years by Stage One, the world renowned Theatre for Young Audiences in Louisville, KY. Other theatres that have performed the play are the Public Theatre of Kentucky in Bowling Green, KY, and by The Communication Department of Mississippi College in Clinton, MS. The book was next adapted into a television movie on ABC in 1983, starring Loretta Swit and Fairuza Balk. Robinson also wrote this adaptation's teleplay. First Stage in Milwaukee has presented the show nine times since 1990. In 2018, they are producing the musical version. First Stage always utilizes Age Appropriate Casting. The Herdmans were featured in two sequels, The Best Halloween Ever! and The Best School Year Ever. In November 2016, the Children's Theatre of Charlotte in Charlotte, NC, premiered The Best Christmas Pageant Ever: The Musical written by Jahnna Beecham and Malcolm Hillgartener and featuring a cast of both student and professional adult actors. The musical had the highest ticket sales of any show in the theatre's history, causing CTC to remount the show in the 2017 season. Hannah Hurmence once played Gladys in an award-winning theatrical rendition of the novel. Ms. Hurmence went on to star in The Bachelorette, Season 719.

The Warrego River is northernmost tributary of the Darling River. Course and features The river rises from below Mount Ka Ka Mundi in the Carnarvon Range, near Tambo in Queensland, and flows generally south, reaching its confluence with the Darling River, downstream from Bourke. The river is joined by thirty-seven tributaries, including the Nive and Langlo rivers; descending over its course. The river flows through a series of reservoirs, including the Dillalah Waterhole, Ten Mile Waterhole, Lower Lila Dam, Six Mile Dam, Turtle Waterhole, and Boera Dam. The towns of Augathella, Charleville, Wyandra, and Cunnamulla are located on the banks of the river. =Inflows= Most of the basin of the Warrego is too dry for cropping and has a very erratic rainfall of between . It is covered with a natural vegetation of grassland of more fertile clay soils, and saltbush shrubland on less fertile red earths. The predominant land use is low-intensity grazing of sheep and cattle: the river's flow is much too erratic to permit irrigated cropping. The Warrego is essentially an ephemeral stream: it is not unknown for years to pass without any flow in the basin and substantial amounts of water reach the Darling River only in wet years almost always associated with La Ni√±a events. =Outflows= Below Wyandra the river forms a series of outflowing creeks and anabranches. During floods, the Widgeegoara, Kudnapper and Noorama Creeks allow water to channel into Nebine Creek, a tributary of the Culgoa River. Cuttaburra Creek connects the Warrego to the Paroo River via a distribution system that flows through channels, floodways and wetlands. The Irrara Creek anabranch flows into Kerribree Creek which continues into a number of wetlands before filling Utah Lake. =Flooding= When La Ni√±a strikes, flooding is usual along the Warrego: major floods associated with La Ni√±a events occurred in 1950, 1954 to 1956, 1971, 1973, 1998 and 2008. Oddly, the most destructive flood ever recorded on the river took place in the absence of La Ni√±a. In April 1990, as a result of two extremely strong troughs in the easterlies, over of rain fell in Cunnamulla in two weeks, being more than the annual rainfall in over 60 percent of years. The river, along with most tributaries of the Darling, reached near-record levels and the towns of Augathella and Charleville were devastated. At Charleville a river height peak of was recorded. Fauna The Warrego River is one of a few rivers where silver perch breed naturally. Golden perch and murray cod are also found in the river. Carnarvon Station, once a large cattle property at the rivers headwaters, was acquired by the Australian Bush Heritage Fund in 2001, with the property set aside for the protection of threatened species of birds and animals. Etymology The name Warrego is an Australian Aboriginal word from the Bidyara language, believed to mean \\"bad\\"; and is also an Aboriginal term meaning \\"river of sand\\".Warrego River - Things To See and Do - Queensland Holidays Two warships of the Royal Australian Navy have been named after the river. The Warrego Highway draws its name from the river.  Cultural Heritage  Bidjara (also known as Bidyara, Pitjara, Peechara) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Bidjara people. The Bidjara language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Murweh Shire Council, particularly the towns of Charleville, Augathella and Blackall as well as the properties of Nive Downs and Mount Tabor. Gunya (also known as Kunya, Kunja, Kurnja) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Gunya people.

Regarding his life or the age in which he lived we possess no direct information whatsoever. Works We possess under the name of Alciphron 116 fictional letters, in 3 books, the object of which is to delineate the characters of certain classes of men by introducing them as expressing their peculiar sentiments and opinions upon subjects with which they were familiar. The classes of persons which Alciphron chose for this purpose are fishermen, country people, parasites, and hetaerae or Athenian courtesans. All are made to express their sentiments in the most graceful and elegant language, even where the subjects are of a low or obscene kind. The characters are thus somewhat raised above their common standard, without any great violation of the truth of reality. The form of these letters is exquisitely beautiful, and the language is the pure Attic dialect, such as it was spoken in the best times in familiar but refined conversation at Athens, even though the imaginary writers are country people, fishermen, parasites and courtesans. The city from which the letters are dated is, with a few exceptions, Athens and its vicinity; and the time, wherever it is discernible, is the period after the reign of Alexander the Great. The new Attic comedy was the principal source from which the author derived his information respecting the characters and manners which he describes, and for this reason these letters contain much valuable information about the private life of the Athenians of that time. It has been said that Alciphron was an imitator of Lucian; but besides the style, and, in a few instances, the subject matter, there is no resemblance between the two writers: the spirit in which the two treat their subjects is totally different. Both derived their materials from the same sources, and in style both aimed at the greatest perfection of the genuine Attic Greek. Classical scholar Stephan Bergler has remarked that Alciphron stands in the same relation to Menander as Lucian to Aristophanes. Date Some earlier critics placed him, without any plausible reason, in the 5th century BCE. The classical scholar Stephan Bergler, and others who followed him, placed Alciphron in the period between Lucian and Aristaenetus, that is, between 170 and 350 CE, while others again assign to him a date even earlier than the time of Lucian. Among the letters of Aristaenetus there are two between Lucian and Alciphron;Aristaenetus, i. 5 and 22 and it has been inferred that Alciphron was a contemporary of Lucian. Editions The first edition of Alciphron's letters is that of Italian printer Aldus Manutius, in his collection of the Greek Epistolographers, Venice, 1499, 4to. This edition, however, contains only those letters which, in more modern editions, form the first two books. Seventy-two new letters were added from a Vienna and a Vatican manuscript by Stephan Bergler, in his edition (Leipzig, 1715, 8vo.) with notes and a Latin translation. These seventy-two epistles form the third book in Bergler's edition. J. A. Wagner, in his edition (Leipzig, 1798, 2 vols, 8vo.), with the notes of Bergler), added two new letters entire, and fragments of five others. One long letter, which as of the 19th century had not been published entire in English, exists in several Paris manuscripts. *Editio princeps, Aldus Manutius, (44 letters) (1499) *Stephan Bergler (1715) *English translation by Monro and Beloe (1791) *E.

It is the capital of the comarca of Ribera Alta in the province of Valencia. Geographic situation Alzira is located in the province of Valencia, on the left bank of the J√∫car river, and on the Valencia-Alicante railway. Alzira's climate is typically Mediterranean: warm with no extremes of temperature either in summer or winter. Rainfall is scarce and irregular. Torrential rains usually follow periods of relative drought. The town is situated on the shores of the J√∫car river and contains the Murta and Casella valleys. Alzira's borough extends over 111 square kilometres. History Moorish walls View of Alzira in 1824 by Edward Hawke Locker (can see the bridge semi-destroyed by the French) Alzira was founded by the Muslim Moors under the name Jazirat Shukr () which later became known as J√∫car Island. It was a prosperous trading station during the reign of the Muslim Moors which lasted over five hundred years. During that time the city had a local administrative government and was considered as a cultural hub for writers, philosophers, and law experts. The city was conquered by James I of Aragon on 30 December 1242. Alzira, located right on the bank of the J√∫car, has suffered devastating floods throughout its history - in particular in 1472, 1590, 1864, 1916, 1982 and 1987. Alzira has historically been a walled town, surrounded by palm, orange and mulberry groves, and by low-lying rice-swamps, which rendered its neighborhood somewhat unhealthy. It is sometimes identified with the Roman Saetabicula or with the pre-Roman Sucro. According to one source, the mutiny at Sucro of 206 BC, squelched by Scipio Africanus, was at or near present-day Alzira, a few kilometers east of the mouth of the Sucro/Jucar River.Boix, p. 145: \\"Almost buried in a grove of mulberry trees and towering stands a compact mass of buildings that dominate some towers, and utterly old walls. That is the town of Alzira , that's the old Sucro. Not only in geography, but history also has its place in the city of Sucre.\\" Economy Grefusa's headquarters. Edicions Bromera, headquarters. Agriculture was the prime economic driving force in Alzira up to the mid-20th century. The most important produce are oranges and they are distributed by important local co-operatives. During the 20th century, Alzira changed from an agricultural based economy to a diversified industry-orientated city with an important commercial infrastructure and associated services. Many outstanding companies have their head-office in the city: building and publishing companies, diverse manufacturers, textile and ice cream factories, etc. Alzira has become a very important commercial city due to its influence area, which is estimated about 300,000 inhabitants. Healthcare Alzira has a 250-bed Community Hospital, the Hospital de la Ribera, which was built in 1999 by UTE-Ribera, under a Private Finance Initiative scheme. Under the contract the Valencia Health Department pays an annual capitation-fee per inhabitant of 420 euros to Ribera Salud. There are about 250000 inhabitants in the area. The hospital has to pay for any treatment provided elsewhere for those inhabitants, and they are at liberty to go elsewhere. After 10 years the building reverts to the Valencia Health Department. During 2001, there were 19205 inpatient episodes, 19098 surgical acts, 115428 A&E; visits, and 462733 outpatient visits. 90% of the patients seen were very satisfied with the care they got. This capitation based system with integration between primary and secondary care providers and a unified IT system across all services has become known as the Alzira model and received a great deal of attention. The quality of services appears to be considerably higher than other health care systems.  Main sights  * Monastery of la Murta: It is constituted of buildings rising in the following three periods: SXIX_XV, XVI y XVII. In the 19th century, after the expropriation, his new owner raised a manor over the hospice of the monastery. The Monastery also has a partition battlemented wall. Nowadays, In the garden. There are still remainders gathering in the walls. In that way, it has prepared to increase the defensive function. The elements of the group are: Monastery: The new church and the Tower of the Bells._ Fortified tower of la Porteria. Ruins of the monastery and adjacent elements. Foster chapel of ‚ÄôLa Virgen de la Murta‚Äô, after it was a sacristy. * Alzira walled circuit: The walls of Alzira were built around a possible river island, from which derives its name in Arabic (Al-Yazira: The Island) had a dual purpose, first the defense, and second the flood protection of J√∫car river. The walls were buried by the river, which floods the city from three to four times a year. The walled circuit was formed by a double wall which today contains the historical center of ‚Äúla Vila‚Äù, dated in the Islamic period where some of the mosques and baths were settled. Nowadays, the remains are located in two areas of the city, ‚Äúel parque de las murallas‚Äù and ‚Äúlas murallas del Antiguo Mercado‚Äù * Town council hall of Alzira: This building has a civil Gothic style of the Crown of Aragon. Its oldest part dates from the 16th century and, although we can say that the construction of its plant obeys to medieval patterns alternating the Ghotic style and the Baroque. It is a building with a quadrangular plant and a three water covered with Arabic tiles in whose construction the following local unions have collaborated: stonecutters, carpenters and mull wall. Its interior rooms are arranged around a rectangular gallery. In 1930 it was declared an Artistic National Monument * Santa Catalina church of Alzira : The building was rebuilt in the 17th century on an earlier mosque, with a Gothic basilica and a Gothic factory. It is inserted into the so-called ‚Äúreconquista‚Äù churches with a single ground covered with a cannon vault open with lunettes and open chapels between buttresses, covered with a mid-cannon vault. Over the transept, a drum covered by a dome over scallops sets up. This was replaced by a new double-sloped roof that covers the entire temple http://www.programmemed.eu/uploads/tx_ausybibliomed/Cultural_Heritage_Poles_Study_Section_6_MANRA.pdf * Mare de D√©u del Lluch Sanctuary of Alzira: Construction built in a neo- Romanesque style. The temple of three naves is covered with groin vault, while the major chapel is fixed with another kind of vault. The access is through a big door which emulates the Romanesque style on which there are three big windows topped by an oculus. They allow the entrance of the light inside of the enclosure. To the left, the bell tower rises separated into three sections and covered with pyramidal spire. In the central part of the second section, there are two windows which placed one above the other emphasizes the verticallity of the entire monument. The third section separated from the previous one by a decorated wide strip includes the group of bells. * Museum: Noble Gothic-Renaissance house that houses the Municipal Museum of Alzira. It brings together the cultural heritage of Alzira and the Ribera Alta, so it is possible to contemplate the evolutionary aspects under both, physical and human settlements established in the territory, from prehistory to the present day. It has interesting historical and artistic funds of the city and its region. Permanent exhibitions are divided into four sections: cartography, archeology, ethnology and history, and arts.

It refers to the common experience of Russian peasants of plowing up an apparent under-layer of ash (leached or E horizon) during first plowing of a virgin soil of this type.Rode A. A. To the problem of the degree of podzolization of soils // Studies in the genesis and geography of soils. M.: Acad. Sci. USSR, 1935. P. 55-70.  Characteristics  Podzols can occur on almost any parent material but generally derive from either quartz-rich sands and sandstone or sedimentary debris from magmatic rocks, provided there is high precipitation.Chesworth, W. (Eds.), 2008. Encyclopedia of soil science, The Netherlands. Most Podzols are poor soils for agriculture due to the sandy portion, resulting in a low level of moisture and nutrients. Some are sandy and excessively drained. Others have shallow rooting zones and poor drainage due to subsoil cementation. A low pH further compounds issues, along with phosphate deficiencies and aluminum toxicity. The best agricultural use of Podzols is for grazing, although well-drained loamy types can be very productive for crops if lime and fertilizer are used. The E horizon (or Ae in Canadian soil classification system), which is usually thick, is low in Fe and Al oxides and humus. It is formed under moist, cool and acidic conditions, especially where the parent material, such as granite or sandstone, is rich in quartz. It is found under a layer of organic material in the process of decomposition, which is usually thick. In the middle, there is often a thin horizon of . The bleached soil horizon goes over into a red or red-brown horizon (so-called Podzolic B). The colour is strongest in the upper part, and change at a depth of progressively to the part of the soil that is mainly not affected by processes; that is the parent material. The soil profiles are designated by the letters A (topsoil), E (eluviated soil), B (subsoil) and C (parent material). In some Podzols, the E horizon is absent‚Äîeither masked by biological activity or obliterated by disturbance. Podzols with little or no E horizon development are often classified as brown Podzolic soils, also called Umbrisols or Umbrepts. Geographic distribution Podzols cover about worldwide and are usually found under sclerophyllous woody vegetation. By extent Podzols are most common in temperate and boreal zones of the northern hemisphere but they can also be found in other settings including both temperate rainforests and tropical areas.Spaargaren, Otto. Podzols. Encyclopedia of Soil Science, pp. 580‚Äì581. In South America Podzols occur beneath Nothofagus betuloides forests in Tierra del Fuego.  Podzolization  A Podzol with a characteristic eluvial (bleached, ash-colored) horizon and intensely coloured illuvial horizons. The photo was taken in the Feldberg area, Southern Black Forest, Germany. Podzolization (or Podsolization) is complex soil formation process by which dissolved organic matter and ions of iron and aluminium, released through weathering of various minerals, form organo-mineral complexes (chelates) and are moved from the upper parts of the soil profile and deposit in the deeper parts of soil. Through this process, the eluvial horizon becomes bleached and of ash-grey colour. The complexes move with percolating water further down to illuviated horizons which are commonly coloured brown, red or black as they accumulate and consist of cemented sesquioxides and/or organic compounds. The podzolization is a typical soil formation process in Podzols. = Preconditions = Podzolization usually occurs under forest or heath vegetation and is common in cool and humid climates as these climates inhibit the activity of soil microbes in the topsoil. Overall, podzolization happens where the decomposition of organic matter is inhibited and as a result, acidic organic surface (mor) layers build up. Under these typically acidic conditions, nutrient deficiency further hampers the microbial degradation of organic complexing agents. Medium to coarse textured soils with base-poor parent material (usually rich in quartz) also promote podzolization, as they encourage percolating water flow. = Key steps = A conceptualization of the process of podzolization in a typical Podzol. The soil-forming process of podzolization can be broken down into two main steps: # Mobilization and translocation of organic matter, Fe and Al from the surface horizon, and # Immobilization and stabilization of organic matter, Fe and Al into the subsoil. In the topsoil of acidic soils, organic matter (mostly from plant litter, the humus layer and root exudates) together with Al- and Fe-ions, form organo-mineral complexes. These soluble chelates then relocate with percolating water from the A (or E horizon) to the B-horizon. As a result of this, the E horizon (or Ae horizon in the Canadian system of soil classification) is left bleached and ash-grey in colour, while the B horizon becomes enriched with relocated organo-mineral complexes. The colour of B horizon is consequently red, brown or black, depending on the dominance of metal ions or organic matter. Usually, the boundary between the B and eluvial Ae (or E) horizon is very distinct, and sometimes a hardpan (or Ortstein) can form, as the relocated Fe and Al and organic matter increase mineral particles, cementing them into this compacted layer. There are several reasons why these organo-mineral complexes immobilize in the B horizon: If during the eluviation process more Al- or Fe-ions bind to the organic compounds, the complex can flocculate as the solubility of it decreases with increasing metal to carbon ratio. Apart from that, a higher pH (or higher Ca content) in the lower soil horizons can result in the breakdown of metal-humus complexes. In the lower soil layers, the organic complexing agents can be degraded by functioning microorganism. Already established complexes in the B horizon can act as a filter, as they adsorb the traveling complexes from the upper soil horizons. A decreased water conductivity due to higher clay content can also result in the early flocculation of organo-mineral complexes. The relocated substances can sometimes separate in the illuvial horizons. Then, organic substances are mostly enriched in the uppermost part of the illuvial horizon, whereas Fe- and Al-oxides are mostly found in the lower parts of the illuvial horizon. Podzolization also promotes the relocation of some nutrients (Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo and P) that sometimes brings them closer to plant roots.  In different soil classification systems  The term Podzols is used in the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) and in many national soil classification systems (in some of them, spelled Podsols). The USDA soil taxonomyKeys to Soil Taxonomy 2014 and the Chinese soil taxonomy call these soils Spodosols. The Canadian system of soil classification matches Podzols with soils under the Podzolic order (e.g. Humo-Ferric Podzol). The Australian Soil Classification uses the term Podosols. The Brazilian Soil Classification System calls them Espodossolos.

It was launched into Earth orbit on August 30, 1991 by the M-3SII rocket from Kagoshima Space Center. It took its first soft X-ray image on September 13, 1991 21:53:40, and movie representations of the X-ray corona over 1991-2001 are available at the Yohkoh Legacy site. Description The satellite was three-axis stabilized and in a near-circular orbit. It carried four instruments: a Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT), a Hard X-ray Telescope (HXT), a Bragg Crystal Spectrometer (BCS), and a Wide Band Spectrometer (WBS). About 50 MB were generated each day and stored on board by a 10.5 MB bubble memory recorder. Because SXT utilized a charge-coupled device (CCD) as its readout device, perhaps being the first X-ray astronomical telescope to do so, its \\"data cube\\" of images was both extensive and convenient, and it revealed much interesting detail about the behavior of the solar corona. Previous solar soft X-ray observations, such as those of Skylab, had been restricted to film as a readout device. Yohkoh therefore returned many novel scientific results, especially regarding solar flares and other forms of magnetic activity.Yohkoh Science Nuggets The mission ended after more than ten years of successful observation when it went into its \\"safehold\\" mode during an annular eclipse on December 14, 2001 20:58:33 and the spacecraft lost lock on the sun. Operational mistakes and other flaws combined in such a way that its solar panels could no longer charge the batteries, which drained irreversibly; several other solar eclipses had successfully been observed. On September 12, 2005 the spacecraft burned up during reentry over South Asia. The time of reentry, as provided by the U.S. Space Surveillance Network, was 6:16 pm Japan Standard Time (JST). Instruments Yohkoh carried four instruments :Yohkoh Analysis Guide version 2.9x / Instrument Manual. Eds. M.D.Morrison, R.D.Bentley. 1999. * The Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) was an X-ray telescope with glancing incidence X-ray mirror and a CCD sensor. There was also a co- aligned optical telescope using the same CCD, but after the failure of the entrance filter in November 1992 it became unusable. The CCD was 1024√ó1024 pixels with pixel angular size of 2.45‚Ä≥√ó2.45‚Ä≥, a point-spread function (core width FWHM) of about 1.5 pixels (i.e. 3.7‚Ä≥), a field of view of 42‚Ä≤√ó42‚Ä≤, which was a little larger than the whole solar disk. Typical time resolution was 2 s in flare mode and 8 s in quiet (no flare) mode, the maximum time resolution in 0.5 s. For spectral discrimination, STX employed wide-band filters installed on a filter wheel. There were five usable filter positions: 1265 √Ö-thick Al filter (2.5 √Ö‚Äì36 √Ö pass band), Al/Mg/Mn filter (2.4 √Ö‚Äì32 √Ö), 2.52 Œºm Mg filter (2.4 √Ö‚Äì23 √Ö), 11.6 Œºm Al filter (2.4 √Ö‚Äì13 √Ö), 119 Œºm Be filter (2.3 √Ö‚Äì10 √Ö). Before the entrance filter failure in November 1992 three more filter positions were available: no analysis filter (2.5 √Ö‚Äì46 √Ö), Wide band optical filter (4600 √Ö‚Äì4800 √Ö), Narrow band optical filter (4290 √Ö‚Äì4320 √Ö). * The Hard X-ray Telescope (HXT) was a Fourier-synthesis X-ray imager with 64 bigrid collimators sparsely sampling the (u,v) plane and feeding individual scintillation-counter detectors. HXT was sensitive to photons with energies from 14 keV to 93 keV, this range was divided into four energy bands (called L, M1, M2, H). The angular resolution was about 5‚Ä≥, image synthesis field of view is 2‚Ä≤√ó2‚Ä≤, maximum time resolution was 0.5 s. * Bragg Crystal Spectrometer (BCS) was two bent crystal spectrometers sensitive in four spectral lines: the line of ion Fe XXVI (1.76 √Ö‚Äì1.81 √Ö), ion Fe XXV (1.83 √Ö‚Äì1.90 √Ö), ion Ca XIX (3.16 √Ö‚Äì3.19 √Ö), and ion S XV (5.02 √Ö‚Äì5.11 √Ö). Spectral resolution varied in the range of Œª/ŒîŒª=3000‚Äì8000, typical time resolution in flare mode was 8 s, maximum is 0.125 s. BCS integrates radiation over the whole solar disc. * Wide Band Spectrometer (WBS) had spectroscopic capabilities in a wide energy band from 3 keV to 100 MeV. WBS was a set of four subinstruments, e–∞ch of them outputs Pulse Count (PC) corresponding to intensity integrated over a band, and Pulse Height (PH) profile which corresponded to spectrum. Time resolution for PC (0.125 s‚Äì4 s for different subinstruments and modes) was 8‚Äì16 times better than for PH (1 s‚Äì32 s). WBS integrated radiation over the whole Sun and did not resolve source position. ** Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) consisted of two proportional gas counters with nominal energy band 5 keV‚Äì40 keV, which was divided into two PC channels and 128 PH channels. It was found after the launch that PH to energy relationship was distorted. No energy calibration for WBS PH data was available in 1999. ** Hard X-ray Spectrometer (HXS) was a NaI(Tl) scintillator. The energy band after June 1992 was 24 keV‚Äì830 keV. It was divided into 2 PC channels and 32 PH channels. ** Gamma-ray Spectrometer (GRS) consisted of two identical bismuth germanate oxide scintillators. It covered energy range 0.3 MeV‚Äì100 MeV, which was divided into 6 PC channels and 128+16 PH channels. ** Radiation Belt Monitor (RBM) unlike the other three was not aimed at solar flare observations and served to sound the alarm for radiation belt passage.

The series features a fictional theatrical company, Westfield's Men, and, in particular, Nicholas Bracewell, its book-holder, a position similar to that of the modern stage manager. His next series as Marston was set during the reign of William the Conqueror; its two main characters, surveyors for Domesday Book, are Ralph Delchard, a Norman soldier, and Gervase Bret, a former novice turned lawyer, who is half Saxon and half Breton. Marston began his Restoration series in 1999 featuring architect/detective Christopher Redmayne and the puritan Constable Jonathan Bale. Six books were written in this series, with the last one, The Painted Lady, released in 2007. In the \\"Captain Rawson\\" series, Marston has written about a soldier and spy operating during the military campaigns of the Duke of Marlborough. In recent years, he began the \\"Home Front Detective Series\\", set in London during the First World War; seven had been published as of 2019. His \\"Bow Street Rivals\\" series, set in London during the Napoleonic Wars, includes five books, with the latest (February 2019) being Fugitive From the Grave.http://edwardmarston.com/pubs2019.html Marston has been most prolific in his \\"Railway Detective\\" series, published by Allison & Busby. This is set in the middle of the 19th century against the background of the \\"Railway Age\\". It concerns two Scotland Yard detectives, Inspector Robert Colbeck and Sergeant Victor Leeming, whose cases are invariably linked to the railways. Colbeck is a former barrister who is enthralled by the railways and marries a railwayman's daughter. Leeming, in contrast, detests travelling by train and yearns for the days of horse-drawn transport. Beginning with The Railway Detective itself in 2004, there were sixteen titles in this series to the end of 2017. In June 2018, Points of Danger was published while Fear on the Phantom Special was scheduled for release in October 2019.http://edwardmarston.com/pubs2019.html =Other pseudonyms= Miles has used three other pseudonyms: Martin Inigo, Conrad Allen and David Garland. As Allen, he wrote about the private detectives George Porter Dillman and Genevieve Masefield, who operated aboard ocean liners of the early 20th century. There were eight books in this series, starting with Murder on the Lusitania (1999) and concluding with Murder on the Celtic (2007).https://www.bookseriesinorder.com/edward-marston/ As Garland he wrote novels about the American Revolutionary War, Saratoga and Valley Forge.http://www.edwardmarston.com/about2.html He also wrote several other types of books as Garland.https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/62764.David_Garland He used the pseudonym Christopher Mountjoy for three books in the 1980s, Coming of Age, Queen and Country and The Honourable Member.http://www.edwardmarston.com/about2.htmlhttps://www.amazon.com/Christopher- Mountjoy/e/B0034Q032W%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share Bibliography =As Keith Miles= * Warrior Kings (1978) * The Alan Saxon series *# Bullet Hole (1986) *# Double Eagle (1987) *# Green Murder (1990) *# Flagstick (1991) *# Bermuda Grass (2002) *# Honolulu Play-Off (2004) * The Merlin Richards series, Set in the late 1920s.

Ice hotels, dependent on sub-freezing temperatures, are constructed from ice and snow and typically have to be rebuilt every year. Ice hotels exist in several countries, and they have varying construction styles, services and amenities, the latter of which may include ice bars, restaurants, chapels, saunas and hot tubs. Overview Ice hotels are promoted for adventurous travelers who are interested in novelties and unusual environments and are comfortable with the outdoors. Customers have to be prepared to sleep in beds made of snow or ice, but in the warmth of furs, blankets and sleeping bags designed to withstand extremely cold temperatures. Temperature in the rooms is below zero Celsius, but much warmer than outside. Staying at an ice hotel is expensive as prices for a night range from around US$300 to $3,000. Some ice hotels may be destination hotels. Lobbies are often filled with ice sculptures, and food and drinks are specially chosen for the circumstances. For instance, glasses in an ice bar can be made of ice and people sit on benches made of ice. An ice bar, sometimes associated with an ice hotel, is a drinking establishment primarily made of ice. Construction Ice hotels are dependent upon sub-freezing temperatures (colder than 0 ¬∞C or 32 ¬∞F) during construction and operation. This imposes time constraints on construction and makes the hotel's season short. Construction typically begins between November and March when snow can be compacted and thick levels of ice form. Although constructing an ice hotel is more labor-intensive than a regular building, building materials are cheaper. Ice hotels have to be reconstructed every year. This is not entirely detrimental to the operators; if an ice hotel does not meet its financial goals, the owner can simply let the building melt in the spring and is left with no building to permanently upkeep. The walls, fixtures, and fittings are made entirely of ice or compacted snow, and are held together using a substance known as snice, which takes the place of mortar in a traditional brick-built hotel. Sometimes steel framing is used in their construction. By Country =Canada= Ice Hotel The H√¥tel de Glace () first opened in January 2001. 85 rooms are furnished with ice beds covered with deer furs and mattresses and equipped with arctic sleeping bags. It was originally located on the shores of Lac-Saint-Joseph, Quebec, 31 minutes north of Quebec City, but has since moved closer to the city, 10 minutes away from Old Town Quebec. It operates from the first week in January to the last week in March. It has the adjacent Le Quatre Temps restaurant, an ice bar named Absolut Ice Bar, which serves Absolut Vodka and other beverages, sauna and outdoor hot tub. Construction involves the use of blocks of ice and snow. In 2005, construction involved \\"400 tons of clear ice blocks, trucked in from Montreal, and 12,000 tons of snow produced on site.\\" Beds are constructed of ice, which are topped with \\"a wooden boxspring and mattress\\", and mummy-style sleeping bags are provided. The hotel offers paid tours, the participants of which are allowed to use the ice bar until midnight. Ice Hotel was previously the only ice hotel in North America. Image:qbicehotelchapel2.JPGThe chapel, 2006 File:Icehotelcanada.JPGThe chapel, 2006 Snow Village Snow Village is a half-hectare village and 30-room ice hotel located in Parc Jean-Drapeau, east of Montreal, in Quebec, Canada that first opened in 2012. It has suites, standard rooms and igloos, an ice restaurant, ice bar and patio, ice chapel and outdoor hot tubs. It is constructed from man-made snow created by snowmaking machines, which is blown onto frames that are removed when construction is complete. This is performed because the density of the artificial snow is greater than that of natural snow. The hotel is equipped with fire alarms that are built into snow walls, as required by the city of Montreal. Initial construction cost $2.1 million, and the Quebec government provided some financial support for its construction. =Finland= SnowCastle of Kemi The SnowCastle of Kemi in Kemi, Finland is the largest snow fort in the world, is rebuilt every winter and has a snow hotel with double rooms and a honeymoon suite. The facility also has a restaurant, chapel, and ice sculptures. It is near the Gulf of Bothnia. The style of the facility, including the theme, shape, size and decorations, changes annually. File:LumiLinna.jpgA view in 2006 File:SnowCastle, Kemi, Finland.jpgThe dining room in February 2013 Lainio Snow Village The Lainio Snow Village is located 150 km north of the Arctic Circle in Lapland. This snow hotel is built in the winter atop a wood building. In 2007, construction began in November, and in early November, it began providing lodging. The hotel has restrooms and a sauna, and the village has a restaurant. Rooms are decorated with artwork created from snow. In 2007, art students contributed to the art with professional artists. In the summer, the village provides log cabin lodging. =Japan= The Alpha Resort Tomamu in the Shimukappu village of Hokkaido Island in Japan builds and opens an ice hotel every year. It may be Japan's first ice hotel, and everything in it is constructed from ice. The hotel interiors are typically ‚àí3 to ‚àí5 ¬∞C. Guests dine on ice tables and sit on ice chairs covered with sheepskin. The hotel provides sheepskin apparel for guests to stay warm. =Norway= Ice Bar Ice Bar, run by Ice Hotel, is a bar located in downtown Oslo, Norway which serves drinks all year long in an artificially frozen environment. Ice Lodge The Ice Lodge in Norway is part of the Bjorligard Hotel. It is the largest ice hotel in Norway, and its season is longer than other ice hotels due to its 1,250-meter altitude. Kirkenes Snow Hotel The Kirkenes Snow Hotel is located in Finnmark, Norway, the easternmost and northernmost county in Norway. The hotel is 15 km from the Norwegian-Russian border and first opened in 2006. It had 20 rooms and the largest snow dome in Norway (8 metres high and 12 metres in diameter). All the rooms were individually decorated by ice artists from Finland and Japan. The west Snow Hall was decorated by local sculptor Arild Wara. A night in the snow hotel is combined with a special dinner prepared on an open fire. Visitors can get a sauna before or after staying at the hotel. The hotel has an ice bar, a reindeer park, and a husky farm. Sorrisniva Igloo Hotel Sorrisniva Igloo Hotel, in the outlying area of Alta, has been rebuilt yearly since 1999. It is Europe‚Äôs northernmost ice hotel, as it is in the Finnmark region and is approximately 250 km from North Cape. The 2,000 square meter hotel has 30 rooms, including two suites. It is decorated with ice sculptures and ice furnishings, including lighting systems which enhance the different types of crystalline formations. Besides the bedrooms the hotel contains an ice chapel, ice gallery and ice bar where drinks are served in glasses made of ice. Additional facilities include a sauna and outdoor bathtubs with hot water. The ice sculptures at the hotel change yearly. The Sorrisniva Igloo Hotel in Alta has a changing theme every year. In 2004, it was a Viking theme, in 2005, Norwegian fairytales, and in 2006, the theme was wild animals of the region. To stay warm when sleeping, guests use sleeping bags that sit on top of reindeer hides. File:AltaBar.JPGEntrance to the ice bar File:AltaBar1.JPGInterior of the ice bar =Romania= Ice Church in Romania, 2011 B√¢lea Lake Ice Hotel, the first ice hotel in Eastern Europe was built in 2006 in Romania, deep in the FƒÉgƒÉra»ô Mountains, at an elevation of 2034 meters above sea level. At winter, it is only accessible by cable car, since the national road DN7, the TransfƒÉgƒÉrƒÉ»ôan, is closed in the winter. This picturesque setting is next to B√¢lea Lake, where each year local craftsmen wait for the lake to freeze, before using the ice to build the small 12-room Ice Hotel and its adjacent Ice Church, Ice Restaurant and Ice Bar. Local artists imitate sculptures by Romanian modernist sculptor, Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi. Typically the hotel is completed in December and is open until it melts in late March or April. Bedding, furs, specialist sleeping bags are all provided, with bathroom facilities nearby. There are two chalets within walking distance, which also provide accommodation. Activities such as skiing, sledging or riding a snow bike are on offer. Those who are more organised and adventurous can arrange heliskiing. The B√¢lea Lake Ice Hotel is Romanian owned, but has a relationship with a travel company Untravelled Paths Limited, based in the United Kingdom. =Sweden= Icehotel Jukkasj√§rvi Each year between December and April, the Icehotel in the village of Jukkasj√§rvi is open. It is about 17 km from Kiruna, Sweden, and it was the world's first ice hotel. 80 rooms and suites are available. In addition to the entrance hall, the hotel has a chapel and an ice bar named Absolut Icebar. In 1989, Japanese ice artists visited the area and created an exhibition of ice art. In spring 1990, French artist Jannot Derid held an exhibition in a cylinder-shaped igloo in the area. One night there were no rooms available in the town, so some of the visitors asked for permission to spend the night in the exhibition hall. They slept in sleeping bags on top of reindeer skin. The entire hotel is made out of snow and ice blocks taken from the Torne River; even the glasses in the bar are made of ice. Each spring, around March, Icehotel harvests ice from the frozen river and stores it in a nearby production hall with room for over 100,000 tons of ice and 30,000 tons of snow. Some of the blocks of ice weigh two tons, and cranes are used to place them. The ice is used for creating Icebar designs and ice glasses, for ice sculpting classes, events and product launches all over the world while the snow is used for building a strong structure for the building. About 1,000 tons of what is left is used in the construction of the next Icehotel. Each year, for the past 24 years now, the ice hotel has accepted applications from artists around the world to design the world-famous hotel's art suites. In 2013 there were more than 200 applications submitted from a wide range of artists to design and build an Art Suite. These included artists from a variety of creative backgrounds ‚Äì including theatre and photography, to interior design and architecture. Around 15 applications are accepted with their designs and head there in November to build the suites.

Every winter IGLOOTEL is being built and designed from scratch in cooperation with engineers and designers. IGLOOTEL consists of different IGLOOs, for example Sleeping-IGLOOs, Event-IGLOOs, an Ice-Bar and an Aurora Spa Area with a wood fired Outdoor Sauna and Hot Tubs. The IGLOOs are connected through hallways, which are also made of snow and ice. IGLOOTEL has an inner surface area of approx. 900 ‚Äì 1.000 m2. Engravings in the snow and ice walls, illuminations and other art varies and creates a new, individual theme each year. Design students from an Art Academy develop the theme and create unique art work in each of the IGLOOs. Natural materials, for example local woods and reindeer skins are used to establish a comfortable atmosphere. The temperature inside IGLOOTEL is constantly between 0 ¬∞C (32 ¬∞F) and -4 ¬∞C (25 ¬∞F). The beds in IGLOOTEL Lapland are built on wooden platforms with mattresses and reindeer skins. Guests sleep in polar sleeping bags. =Switzerland= The ski resort in the village of Gstaad, Switzerland in the Swiss Alps has an igloo village where guests can rent igloos for overnight lodging. In the igloos, sleeping areas are raised, and are \\"layered with foam, carpet and sheep skins\\", atop which sleeping bags are provided. Lighting is provided by candles.

The name \\"xenobiology\\" derives from the Greek word xenos, which means \\"stranger, alien\\". Xenobiology is a form of biology that is not (yet) familiar to science and is not found in nature. In practice, it describes novel biological systems and biochemistries that differ from the canonical DNA‚ÄìRNA-20 amino acid system (see central dogma of molecular biology). For example, instead of DNA or RNA, XB explores nucleic acid analogues, termed xeno nucleic acid (XNA) as information carriers. It also focuses on an expanded genetic code and the incorporation of non- proteinogenic amino acids into proteins. Difference between xeno-, exo-, and astro-biology \\"Astro\\" means \\"star\\" and \\"exo\\" means \\"outside\\". Both exo- and astrobiology deal with the search for naturally evolved life in the Universe, mostly on other planets in the circumstellar habitable zone. (These are also occasionally referred to as xenobiology.) Whereas astrobiologists are concerned with the detection and analysis of life elsewhere in the Universe, xenobiology attempts to design forms of life with a different biochemistry or different genetic code than on planet Earth. Aims  * Xenobiology has the potential to reveal fundamental knowledge about biology and the origin of life. In order to better understand the origin of life, it is necessary to know why life evolved seemingly via an early RNA world to the DNA-RNA-protein system and its nearly universal genetic code. Was it an evolutionary \\"accident\\" or were there constraints that ruled out other types of chemistries? By testing alternative biochemical \\"primordial soups\\", it is expected to better understand the principles that gave rise to life as we know it. * Xenobiology is an approach to develop industrial production system with novel capabilities by means of enhanced biopolymer engineering and pathogen resistance. The genetic code encodes in all organisms 20 canonical amino acids that are used for protein biosynthesis. In rare cases, special amino acids such as selenocysteine, pyrrolysine or formylmethionine, can be incorporated by the translational apparatus in to proteins of some organisms.Wiltschi, B. and N. Budisa, \\"Natural history and experimental evolution of the genetic code\\". Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, 2007. 74: pp. 739‚Äì53 By using additional amino acids from among the over 700 known to biochemistry, the capabilities of proteins may be altered to give rise to more efficient catalytical or material functions. The EC-funded project Metacode, for example, aims to incorporate metathesis (a useful catalytical function so far not known in living organisms) into bacterial cells. Another reason why XB could improve production processes lies in the possibility to reduce the risk of virus or bacteriophage contamination in cultivations since XB cells would no longer provide suitable host cells, rendering them more resistant (an approach called semantic containment) * Xenobiology offers the option to design a \\"genetic firewall\\", a novel biocontainment system, which may help to strengthen and diversify current bio-containment approaches. One concern with traditional genetic engineering and biotechnology is horizontal gene transfer to the environment and possible risks to human health. One major idea in XB is to design alternative genetic codes and biochemistries so that horizontal gene transfer is no longer possible. Additionally alternative biochemistry also allows for new synthetic auxotrophies. The idea is to create an orthogonal biological system that would be incompatible with natural genetic systems. Scientific approach In xenobiology, the aim is to design and construct biological systems that differ from their natural counterparts on one or more fundamental levels. Ideally these new-to-nature organisms would be different in every possible biochemical aspect exhibiting a very different genetic code. The long-term goal is to construct a cell that would store its genetic information not in DNA but in an alternative informational polymer consisting of xeno nucleic acids (XNA), different base pairs, using non-canonical amino acids and an altered genetic code. So far cells have been constructed that incorporate only one or two of these features. =Xeno nucleic acids (XNA)= Originally this research on alternative forms of DNA was driven by the question of how life evolved on earth and why RNA and DNA were selected by (chemical) evolution over other possible nucleic acid structures. Two hypotheses for the selection of RNA and DNA as life's backbone are either they are favored under life on Earth's conditions, or they were coincidentally present in pre-life chemistry and continue to be used now. Systematic experimental studies aiming at the diversification of the chemical structure of nucleic acids have resulted in completely novel informational biopolymers. So far a number of XNAs with new chemical backbones or leaving group of the DNA have been synthesized, e.g.: hexose nucleic acid (HNA); threose nucleic acid (TNA), glycol nucleic acid (GNA) cyclohexenyl nucleic acid (CeNA). The incorporation of XNA in a plasmid, involving 3 HNA codons, has been accomplished already in 2003. This XNA is used in vivo (E coli) as template for DNA synthesis. This study, using a binary (G/T) genetic cassette and two non-DNA bases (Hx/U), was extended to CeNA, while GNA seems to be too alien at this moment for the natural biological system to be used as template for DNA synthesis. Extended bases using a natural DNA backbone could, likewise, be transliterated into natural DNA, although to a more limited extent. Aside being used as extensions to template DNA strands, XNA activity has been tested for use as genetic catalysts. Although proteins are the most common components of cellular enzymatic activity, nucleic acids are also used in the cell to catalyze reactions. A 2015 study found several different kinds of XNA, most notably FANA (2'-fluoroarabino nucleic acids), as well as HNA, CeNA and ANA (arabino nucleic acids) could be used to cleave RNA during post- transcriptional RNA processing acting as XNA enzymes, hence the name XNAzymes. FANA XNAzymes also showed the ability to ligate DNA, RNA and XNA substrates. Although XNAzyme studies are still preliminary, this study was a step in the direction of searching for synthetic circuit components that are more efficient than those containing DNA and RNA counterparts that can regulate DNA, RNA, and their own, XNA, substrates. =Expanding the genetic alphabet= While XNAs have modified backbones, other experiments target the replacement or enlargement of the genetic alphabet of DNA with unnatural base pairs. For example, DNA has been designed that has ‚Äì instead of the four standard bases A, T, G, and C ‚Äì six bases A, T, G, C, and the two new ones P and Z (where Z stands for 6-Amino-5-nitro3-(l'-p-D-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl)-2(1H)-pyridone, and P stands for 2-Amino-8-(1-beta-D-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl)imidazo[1,2-a]-1,3,5-triazin-4 (8H)). In a systematic study, Leconte et al. tested the viability of 60 candidate bases (yielding potentially 3600 base pairs) for possible incorporation in the DNA. In 2002, Hirao et al. developed an unnatural base pair between 2-amino-8-(2-thienyl)purine (s) and pyridine-2-one (y) that functions in vitro in transcription and translation toward a genetic code for protein synthesis containing a non-standard amino acid. In 2006, they created 7-(2-thienyl)imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (Ds) and pyrrole-2-carbaldehyde (Pa) as a third base pair for replication and transcription, and afterward, Ds and 4-[3-(6-aminohexanamido)-1-propynyl]-2-nitropyrrole (Px) was discovered as a high fidelity pair in PCR amplification. In 2013, they applied the Ds-Px pair to DNA aptamer generation by in vitro selection (SELEX) and demonstrated the genetic alphabet expansion significantly augment DNA aptamer affinities to target proteins. In May 2014, researchers announced that they had successfully introduced two new artificial nucleotides into bacterial DNA, alongside the four naturally occurring nucleotides, and by including individual artificial nucleotides in the culture media, were able to passage the bacteria 24 times; they did not create mRNA or proteins able to use the artificial nucleotides. =Novel polymerases= Neither the XNA nor the unnatural bases are recognized by natural polymerases. One of the major challenges is to find or create novel types of polymerases that will be able to replicate these new-to-nature constructs. In one case a modified variant of the HIV-reverse transcriptase was found to be able to PCR-amplify an oligonucleotide containing a third type base pair. Pinheiro et al. (2012) demonstrated that the method of polymerase evolution and design successfully led to the storage and recovery of genetic information (of less than 100bp length) from six alternative genetic polymers based on simple nucleic acid architectures not found in nature, xeno nucleic acids. =Genetic code engineering= One of the goals of xenobiology is to rewrite the genetic code. The most promising approach to change the code is the reassignment of seldom used or even unused codons.Budisa, N. (2005). Engineering the Genetic Code ‚Äì Expanding the Amino Acid Repertoire for the Design of Novel Proteins, Wiley-VHC Weinheim, New York, Brisbane, Singapore, Toronto In an ideal scenario, the genetic code is expanded by one codon, thus having been liberated from its old function and fully reassigned to a non- canonical amino acid (ncAA) (\\"code expansion\\"). As these methods are laborious to implement, and some short cuts can be applied (\\"code engineering\\"), for example in bacteria that are auxotrophic for specific amino acids and at some point in the experiment are fed isostructural analogues instead of the canonical amino acids for which they are auxotrophic. In that situation, the canonical amino acid residues in native proteins are substituted with the ncAAs. Even the insertion of multiple different ncAAs into the same protein is possible. Finally, the repertoire of 20 canonical amino acids can not only be expanded, but also reduced to 19. By reassigning transfer RNA (tRNA)/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pairs the codon specificity can be changed. Cells endowed with such aminoacyl-[tRNA synthetases] are thus able to read [mRNA] sequences that make no sense to the existing gene expression machinery. Altering the codon: tRNA synthetases pairs may lead to the in vivo incorporation of the non-canonical amino acids into proteins. In the past reassigning codons was mainly done on a limited scale. In 2013, however, Farren Isaacs and George Church at Harvard University reported the replacement of all 321 TAG stop codons present in the genome of E. coli with synonymous TAA codons, thereby demonstrating that massive substitutions can be combined into higher-order strains without lethal effects. Following the success of this genome wide codon replacement, the authors continued and achieved the reprogramming of 13 codons throughout the genome, directly affecting 42 essential genes. An even more radical change in the genetic code is the change of a triplet codon to a quadruplet and even pentaplet codon pioneered by Sisido in cell-free systems and by Schultz in bacteria. Finally, non-natural base pairs can be used to introduce novel amino acid in proteins. =Directed evolution= The goal of substituting DNA by XNA may also be reached by another route, namely by engineering the environment instead of the genetic modules. This approach has been successfully demonstrated by Marli√®re and Mutzel with the production of an E. coli strain whose DNA is composed of standard A, C and G nucleotides but has the synthetic thymine analogue 5-chlorouracil instead of thymine (T) in the corresponding positions of the sequence. These cells are then dependent on externally supplied 5-chlorouracil for growth, but otherwise they look and behave as normal E. coli. These cells, however, are currently not yet fully auxotrophic for the Xeno-base since they are still growing on thymine when this is supplied to the medium. Biosafety Xenobiological systems are designed to convey orthogonality to natural biological systems. A (still hypothetical) organism that uses XNA,Herdewijn, P. and Marli√®re, P. (2009) Toward safe genetically modified organisms through the chemical diversification of nucleic acids. Chem. Biodivers. 6, 791‚Äì808 different base pairs and polymerases and has an altered genetic code will hardly be able to interact with natural forms of life on the genetic level. Thus, these xenobiological organisms represent a genetic enclave that cannot exchange information with natural cells. Altering the genetic machinery of the cell leads to semantic containment. In analogy to information processing in IT, this safety concept is termed a ‚Äúgenetic firewall‚Äù. The concept of the genetic firewall seems to overcome a number of limitations of previous safety systems. A first experimental evidence of the theoretical concept of the genetic firewall was achieved in 2013 with the construction of a genomically recoded organism (GRO). In this GRO all known UAG stop codons in E.coli were replaced by UAA codons, which allowed for the deletion of release factor 1 and reassignment of UAG translation function. The GRO exhibited increased resistance to T7 bacteriophage, thus showing that alternative genetic codes do reduce genetic compatibility. This GRO, however, is still very similar to its natural ‚Äúparent‚Äù and cannot be regarded as a genetic firewall. The possibility of reassigning the function of large number of triplets opens the perspective to have strains that combine XNA, novel base pairs, new genetic codes, etc. that cannot exchange any information with the natural biological world. Regardless of changes leading to a semantic containment mechanism in new organisms, any novel biochemical systems still has to undergo a toxicological screening. XNA, novel proteins, etc. might represent novel toxins, or have an allergic potential that needs to be assessed.Schmidt M, Pei L. 2011. Synthetic Toxicology: Where engineering meets biology and toxicology Toxicological Sciences 120(S1), S204‚Äì24Schmidt M. 2013. Safeguarding the Genetic Firewall with Xenobiology. In: ISGP. 2013. 21st Century Borders/Synthetic Biology: Focus on Responsibility and Governance. Governance and regulatory issues Xenobiology might challenge the regulatory framework, as currently laws and directives deal with genetically modified organisms and do not directly mention chemically or genomically modified organisms. Taking into account that real xenobiology organisms are not expected in the next few years, policy makers do have some time at hand to prepare themselves for an upcoming governance challenge.

Life Wyon was born in Birmingham. He was apprenticed to his father, Thomas Wyon (1767‚Äì1830), the chief engraver of the King's seals, who taught him the art of engraving on steel; subsequently he studied at the sculpture school of the Royal Academy in London, where he earned silver medals in both the antique and the life class. In 1809, he struck his first medal, presented to Lieutenant Pearce, R.N. In 1810, he won the gold medal of the Society of Arts for medal engraving; the die, representing a head of Isis, was purchased by the society and used for striking its prize medals. From this period he produced many medals for schools, societies, Pitt clubs, and other institutions. On 20 November 1811, Wyon was appointed probationary engraver to the Royal Mint, and was employed in making the bank tokens for England and Ireland, and coins for the British colonies and for Hanover. He also engraved his medal commemorative of the peace and his Manchester Pitt medal. On 13 Oct. 1815 he was appointed chief engraver to the mint, being then only twenty-three. The next year he brought out the new silver coinage for the United Kingdom (half-crown, shilling, and sixpence), designing the reverses himself. In 1817 he struck the maundy money, and began to make his pattern crown-piece in rivalry of Thomas Simon. Signs of consumption now began to appear, and Wyon‚Äîa modest and talented artist‚Äîdied on 23 (or 22) September 1817 at the Priory Farmhouse, near Hastings. He was buried in the graveyard attached to Christ Church, Southwark. His younger brother, Benjamin Wyon (1802‚Äì1858), his nephews, Joseph Shepherd Wyon (1836‚Äì1873) and Alfred Benjamin Wyon (1837‚Äì1884), and his cousin, William Wyon (1795‚Äì1851) were also distinguished medallists. Work Among Wyon's medals may be mentioned: 1809, Pearce medal; 1810, Isis medal (re-engraved in 1813); medal of Wellington; 1812, Wooldridge medal; medal for Royal Naval College, Portsmouth; 1813, Manchester Pitt Club medal; \\"Upper Canada preserved\\"; 1814, medals presented to the North American Indians; medal of the tsar of Russia struck during the visit of the Grand Duchess of Oldenburg to the English mint; treaty of Paris (published by Rundell & Co. from his \\"Peace checking the Fury of War,\\" a design which had gained the gold medal of the Society of Arts); centenary of accession of house of Brunswick (for the corporation of Cork), and Liverpool Pitt club medal; 1815, Waterloo medal, with reverse, Victory, adapted from a Greek coin of Elis (Mayo, Medals, plate 22); and 1817, opening of Waterloo Bridge. Wyon also engraved (1813) seals for the Newcastle Antiquarian Society, the Chester Canal Company, and (c. 1815) the Limerick chamber of commerce. Wyon's engraving of Queen Victoria for the City of London medal was used as the basis for the design of the Penny Black, the world's first postage stamp. Examples of the medal, in silver and bronze, are held in the R M Phillips Collection by the British Postal Museum & Archive.  References  External links *Thomas Wyon Jnr.

Origins Yonge was the son and heir of Sir Walter Yonge, 3rd Baronet, and his second wife Gwen Williams, daughter of Sir Robert Williams, 2nd Baronet of Penryn, Cornwall. He was a great-great-grandson of Walter Yonge (1579‚Äì1649), a lawyer, merchant and notable diarist, whose diaries (1604‚Äì45) are valuable material for the contemporaneous history of Great Britain. Career In 1715 Yonge was returned as Member of Parliament for his family's Rotten Borough of Honiton, in Devon and held the seat until 1754. He was also returned for Tiverton at the general elections of 1727, 1747 and 1754 but only took the seat in 1754. In the House of Commons he attached himself to the Whigs, and making himself useful to Sir Robert Walpole, was rewarded with a commissionership of the Treasury in 1724. King George II, who conceived a strong antipathy to Sir William, spoke of him as \\"Stinking Yonge\\"; but Yonge obtained a commissionership of the Admiralty in 1728, was restored to the Treasury in 1730, and in 1735 became Secretary at War. He distinguished himself especially in his defence of the Government against a hostile motion by Pulteney in 1742. He was created KB in 1725. Escot House, Devon Making friends with the Pelhams, he was appointed Vice-Treasurer of Ireland for life in 1746. Acting on the committee of management for the impeachment of Lord Lovat in 1747, he won the applause of Horace Walpole by moving that prisoners impeached for high treason should be allowed the assistance of counsel. In 1748 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was a founding Governor of the Foundling Hospital, which worked to alleviate the scourge of child abandonment. He succeeded his father, the 3rd Baronet, in 1731, taking possession of Escot House near Ottery St Mary, Devon, which had been built by his father. Literary career Yonge enjoyed some reputation as a versifier, some of his lines being even mistaken for the work of Pope, greatly to the disgust of the latter. He wrote the lyrics incorporated in a comic opera, adapted from Richard Brome's The Jovial Crew, which was produced at the Drury Lane Theatre in 1730 and had a considerable success. Marriages and children Yonge married in 1716, Mary, the daughter of Samuel Heathcote of Hackney, from whom he was divorced in 1724. At this point they had lived for some time apart and Yonge had a number of extramarital affairs. But when he found out his wife had a lover, too, he took the opportunity to sue his wife's lover for damages, and then as the result of the divorce proceedings he got his wife's dowry and a greater part of her fortune. The case was the inspiration for Lady Mary Montagu to write a poem \\"Epistle from Mrs Yonge to Her Husband\\", protesting against the sexual double standard of her era.Lipking, Lawrence. Abandoned Women and Poetic Tradition, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1988, p. 10. Google Books By his second wife, Anne Howard, a daughter and coheiress of Thomas Howard, 6th Baron Howard of Effingham, he had two sons and six daughters. Death Yonge died at his seat of Escot, near Honiton, on 10 August 1755. He was succeeded in his title and estates by his eldest son Sir George Yonge, 5th Baronet.

He is also the founder of Johrei, a healing ritual that claims to use \\"divine light\\" to dissolve the spiritual impurities that are the source of all physical, emotional, and personal problems.  Biography  According to his official biography,Johrei History Okada was born to a poor family in Tokyo and, after many trials and tribulations, eventually made his fortune in the jewellery business. Initially a follower of Shinto offshoot Oomoto,JapanFile - the website of Kansai Time Out magazine - Japanese culture, news, events, music, literature, and reporting Okada claimed to have received a special revelation from God in 1926, leading him to found a new religion in 1935 to spread the teachings. Okada soon expanded to open a rehabilitation center centering on the healing powers of light, but it was shut down in 1936 as a violation of the Medical Practitioners' Law (ÂåªÂ∏´Ê≥ïÈÅïÂèç). The Sangetsu (Â±±Êúà) school of ikebana, inspired by Mokichi Okada, was founded in June 1972. The Mokichi Okada Association (MOA) was established in 1980 to continue his work \\"toward the creation of a new civilization to be undertaken without confining Okada's principles and their implementation within a religious framework\\" (MOA acquired the status of a legal entity as a limited liability intermediary corporation in 2005, then transferred to one of general corporation in 2009, officially called MOA International Corporation).

He formerly wrote a column in National Review before moving to a staff position at the white nationalist website VDARE, where he continues to work. He has also written for the New English Review. His columns cover a broad range of political-cultural topics, including immigration, China, history, mathematics, and race. Derbyshire's 1996 novel Seeing Calvin Coolidge in a Dream was a New York Times \\"Notable Book of the Year\\". His 2004 non-fiction book Prime Obsession won the Mathematical Association of America's inaugural Euler Book Prize. A political book, We Are Doomed: Reclaiming Conservative Pessimism, was released in September 2009. Derbyshire has been described as a figure within the alt-right movement.  Early life  Derbyshire attended the Northampton School for Boys and graduated from University College London, of the University of London, where he studied mathematics. Before turning to writing full-time, he worked on Wall Street as a computer programmer. Career =National Review= Derbyshire worked as a writer at National Review until he was terminated in 2012 because of an article published in Taki's Magazine in which Derbyshire wrote about the dangers allegedly posed by African-Americans to whites. Derbyshire then worked at VDARE. =Mathematics= Derbyshire's book Prime Obsession: Bernhard Riemann and the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics was first published in hardcover in 2003 and then paperback in 2004. It focuses on the Riemann hypothesis, one of the Millennium Problems. The book is aimed, as Derbyshire puts it in his prologue, \\"at the intelligent and curious but nonmathematical reader ...\\" Prime Obsession explores such topics as complex numbers, field theory, the prime number theorem, the zeta function, the harmonic series, and others. The biographical sections give relevant information about the lives of mathematicians who worked in these areas, including Euler, Gauss, Lejeune Dirichlet, Lobachevsky, Chebyshev, Vall√©e- Poussin, Hadamard, as well as Riemann himself. In 2006, Joseph Henry Press published another Derbyshire book of popular mathematics: Unknown Quantity: A Real And Imaginary History of Algebra.  Views  Derbyshire writes in general from a small government conservative perspective. He notably ridiculed George W. Bush's \\"itty-bitty tax cut, paid for by dumping a slew of federal debt on your children and grandchildren,\\" derided Bush as too sure of his religious convictions and for his \\"rich-kid-ness\\". He has noted that small- government conservatism is unlikely to ever take hold in the United States (although he is personally sympathetic to it), called for immediate U.S. withdrawal from Iraq (but favoured the invasion), opposed market reforms or any other changes in Social Security, supported legal access to abortion, supported euthanasia in a fairly wide range of circumstances, and suggested that he might (in a time of international crisis) vote for Hillary Clinton as president. Derbyshire wrote about American schooling in his book We Are Doomed, \\"Education is a vast sea of lies, waste, corruption, crackpot theorizing, and careerist log-rolling.\\" He further argued that people \\"had better brace ourselves for the catastrophe\\" coming as a result. Derbyshire once argued that America would be better off if women did not have the right to vote. In 2005, in a monthly column containing a series of miscellaneous musings, he controversially stated that women's physical attractiveness peaks between ages 15 and 20. = Vs National Review = Derbyshire differed from other writers at National Review magazine on many subjects. For example, Derbyshire supported Michael Schiavo's position in the Terri Schiavo case. Derbyshire's views on the Schiavo case attracted criticism from colleagues such as Ramesh Ponnuru. The Derbyshire‚ÄìPonnuru dispute arose again over Ponnuru's 2006 book The Party of Death. Derbyshire reviewed the book harshly in the New English Review, and Ponnuru replied on National Review Online. Though Derbyshire broadly agreed with other writers at National Review Online on immigration, he encountered strong opposition from former NRO blogger John Podhoretz, who described Derbyshire's comments on restricting immigration to maintain \\"ethnic balance\\" in severe terms: \\"But maintaining 'ethnic balance' is not fine. It is chillingly, horrifyingly not fine.\\" In response, fellow Corner contributor Jonah Goldberg, who described himself as philosophically \\"in the middle\\" of the two, noted: > I should say that I think JPod is getting too hung up on the phrase \\"ethnic > balance\\" as a codeword for all sorts of unlovely things. It seems to me that > if you're going to sit down and have any immigration policy at all, it's > unavoidable that you're going to address the issue of ethnic balance in one > way or another, no matter what you call it. Ultimately, you have to choose > where people come from if you have an immigration policy, even if you > emphasize other factors like skills or family unification. So you can either > look at it directly or you can skirt around it. But you can't avoid it. Role in Way of the Dragon Derbyshire had an uncredited role in Way of the Dragon (released in the United States as Return of the Dragon), a 1972 martial arts film directed by, and starring, Bruce Lee. Of landing the part, Derbyshire said: \\"The casting director had obviously just trawled around the low-class guesthouses for unemployed foreigners of a sufficiently thuggish appearance.\\" Personal life In 1986 Derbyshire married Lynette Rose, or Rosie, n√©e Qi (ÈΩê Á∫¢ Áé´; Qi Hongmei), who was raised in China and later became a naturalised U.S. citizen. They have two children, a daughter and a son. He lives on Long Island, New York. Derbyshire was, for a brief time, an illegal immigrant. He often recounted observations from his personal life in his former monthly column, \\"The Straggler,\\" in National Review. Derbyshire said of his family, \\"our two children are, as they are already tired of being told, half English coal miner, half Chinese peasant, 100 percent American.\\" In early 2012, he underwent treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

Bribery of examiners was also common, as represented in works such as the Ming-dynasty story collection The Book of Swindles\\"Type 20: Corruption in Education,\\" in Zhang Yingyu, The Book of Swindles: Selections from a Late Ming Collection, translated by Christopher Rea and Bruce Rusk (New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2017), pp. 142-163. and Qing-dynasty novel Rulin waishi [The Unofficial History of the Scholars]. Standards for citation and referencing began at the end of the 19th century with the emergence of guidance provided by scholarly societies that developed discipline-specific expectations for referencing such as the MLA and the APA.

Lise Buranen and Alice M. Roy (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1999), 45 It has been estimated that as many as two-thirds of students cheated at some point of their college careers at the turn of the 20th century. Fraternities often operated so-called essay banks, where term papers were kept on file and could be resubmitted over and over again by different students, often with the only change being the name on the paper.Stavisky, Leonard Price (1973). \\"Term Paper 'Mills', Academic Plagiarism, and State Regulation\\". Political Science Quarterly: 445‚Äì461. The issue of academic dishonesty became more prominent in the latter half of the twentieth century, as universities shifted towards more democratic approaches to admission. Today Academic dishonesty does not have a universal definition. Educational institutions in different regions understand and act on academic dishonestly in different ways. The following is not an exhaustive listing of regions. = United States = In the United States, one study has shown that 20% of students started cheating in the first grade. Similarly, other studies reveal that currently in the U.S., 56% of middle school students and 70% of high school students have cheated.Wilfried Decoo, Crisis on Campus: Confronting Academic Misconduct (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2002), 23. A large-scale study in Germany found that 75% of the university students admitted that they conducted at least one of seven types of academic misconduct (such as plagiarism or falsifying data) within the previous six months. Students are not the only ones to cheat in an academic setting. A study among North Carolina school teachers found that some 35% of respondents said they had witnessed their colleagues cheating in one form or another. The rise of high-stakes testing and the consequences of the results on the teacher is cited as a reason why a teacher might want to inflate the results of their students.Brian Aaron Jacob & Steven D. Levitt (2003) Catching Cheating Teachers: The Results of an Unusual Experiment in Implementing Theory\\", available at Project Muse. The first scholarly studies in the 1960s of academic dishonesty in higher education found that nationally in the U.S., somewhere between 50‚Äì70% of college students had cheated at least once.William J. Bowers, Student Dishonesty and its Control in Colleges (New York: Bureau of Applied Social Research, Columbia University, 1964), 155. While nationally, these rates of cheating in the U.S. remain stable today, there are large disparities between different schools, depending on the size, selectivity, and anti-cheating policies of the school. Generally, the smaller and more selective the college, the less cheating occurs there. For instance, the number of students who have engaged in academic dishonesty at small elite liberal arts colleges can be as low as 15‚Äì20%, while cheating at large public universities can be as high as 75%.Emily E. LaBeff, et al., \\"Situational Ethics and College Student Cheating\\", Sociological Inquiry 60, no. 2 (May 1990), 192. Moreover, researchers have found that students who attend a school with an honor code are less likely to cheat than students at schools with other ways of enforcing academic integrity.Donald L. McCabe and Linda Klebe Trevino, \\"Academic Dishonesty: Honor Codes and Other Contextual Influences\\", The Journal of Higher Education 64, no. 5, (September‚ÄìOctober 1993), 532. As for graduate education, a recent study found that 56% of MBA students admitted cheating, along with 54% of graduate students in engineering, 48% in education, and 45% in law.Justin Pope, 'Higher education sees rise in dishonesty', Associated Press, May 19, 2007 There is also a great difference in students' perceptions and the reality of their own ethical behavior. In a 2008 survey of 30,000 students in high school carried out by the Josephson Institute for Youth Ethics, 62 percent of students polled said they \\"copied another's homework two or more times in the past year.\\" Yet, on the same survey, 92 percent said they were \\"satisfied with their personal ethics and character.\\" Hence, there is generally a discrepancy between actual behavior and self-image of high school students' character. As more students take courses and assessments online, there is a persistent perception that it is easier to cheat in an online class than a face-to-face course. Moreover, there are online services that offer to prepare any kind of homework of high school and college level and take online tests for students. While administrators are often aware of such websites, they have been unsuccessful in curbing cheating in homework and non-proctored online tests, resorting to a recommendation by the Ohio Mathematics Association to derive at least 80% of the grade of online classes from proctored tests. In addition, colleges and universities are increasingly turning to online proctoring services to oversee tens of thousands of exams per year. While research on academic dishonesty in other countries is less extensive, anecdotal evidence suggests cheating could be even more common in countries like Japan L.M. Dryden, \\"A Distant Mirror or Through the Looking Glass?: Plagiarism and Intellectual Property in Japanese Education\\", in Perspectives on Plagiarism and Intellectual Property in the Postmodern World, ed. Lise Buranen and Alice M. Roy (Albany: SUNY Press, 1999), 75. and Philippines. A typology of academic misconduct has been devised by Perry (2010). Perry's typology presents a two dimensional model of academic misconduct with one dimension measuring the degree to which rules are understood and the other dimension measuring how closely these rules are followed. According to the typology only those students who understand the rules but fail to adhere to the rules are classified as 'cheats'. = Australia = In Australia, academic dishonesty is addressed by the Tertiary Education Quality Standards Agency, which is a government agency. = UK = In the UK, the Quality Assurance Agency is responsible for quality assurance in higher education. It has produced several policy and guidance documents for policy makers, educators and the general public. = Canada = In Canada, academic misconduct is handled by individual post-secondary institutions,MacLeod, P. D. (2014). An Exploration of Faculty Attitudes Toward Student Academic Dishonesty in Selected Canadian Universities. (Doctor of Education), University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada. Retrieved from http://hdl.handle.net/11023/1370 though research into the topic has lagged behind that of other countries. Research has shown that the incidence of academic dishonesty in Canada is similar to that of the United States.Christensen Hughes, J. M., & McCabe, D. L. (2006). Understanding academic misconduct. Canadian Journal of Higher Education, 36(1), 49-63. Types = Bribery = Bribery is an act of giving money or gift giving that alters the behavior of the recipient. Bribery constitutes a crime and is defined by Black's Law Dictionary as the offering, giving, receiving, or soliciting of any item of value to influence the actions of an official or other person in charge of a public or legal duty. The bribe is the gift bestowed to influence the recipient's conduct. It may be any money, good, right in action, property, preferment, privilege, emolument, object of value, advantage, or merely a promise or undertaking to induce or influence the action, vote, or influence of a person in an official or public capacity.See generally T. Markus Funk, \\"Don't Pay for the Misdeeds of Others: Intro to Avoiding Third-Party FCPA Liability,\\" 6 BNA White Collar Crime Report 33 (January 14, 2011) (discussing bribery in the context of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act). =Cheating= crib notes during an examination without prior permission from the instructor is cheating Cheating can take the form of crib notes, looking over someone's shoulder during an exam, or any forbidden sharing of information between students regarding an exam or exercise. Many elaborate methods of cheating have been developed over the years. For instance, students have been documented hiding notes in the bathroom toilet tank, in the brims of their baseball caps, up their sleeves, along their thighs or in their cleavage. Also, the storing of information in graphing calculators, pagers, cell phones, and other electronic devices has cropped up since the information revolution began. While students have long surreptitiously scanned the tests of those seated near them, some students actively try to aid those who are trying to cheat. Methods of secretly signalling the right answer to friends are quite varied, ranging from coded sneezes or pencil tapping to high-pitched noises beyond the hearing range of most teachers. Some students have been known to use more elaborate means, such as using a system of repetitive body signals like hand movements or foot jerking to distribute answers (i.e. where a tap of the foot could correspond to answer \\"A\\", two taps for answer \\"B\\", and so on). Cheating differs from most other forms of academic dishonesty, in that people can engage in it without benefiting themselves academically at all. For example, a student who illicitly telegraphed answers to a friend during a test would be cheating, even though the student's own work is in no way affected. Another example of academic dishonesty is a dialogue between students in the same class but in two different time periods, both of which a test is scheduled for that day. If the student in the earlier time period informs the other student in the later period about the test, that is considered academic dishonesty, even though the first student has not benefited him or herself. One other method is taking advantage of time zones, particularly in exams administered worldwide. Those who take the exam first (likely in Oceania) can then post answers for those about to take the exam (in a time zone behind like Europe). =Deception= Deception is providing false information to a teacher/instructor concerning a formal academic exercise. Examples of this include taking more time on a take- home test than is allowed, giving a dishonest excuse when asking for a deadline extension, or falsely claiming to have submitted work. This type of academic misconduct is often considered softer than the more obvious forms of cheating, and otherwise-honest students sometimes engage in this type of dishonesty without considering themselves cheaters. It is also sometimes done by students who have failed to complete an assignment, to avoid responsibility for doing so. =Fabrication= Fabrication is the falsification of data, information, or citations in any formal academic exercise. This includes making up citations to back up arguments or inventing quotations. Fabrication predominates in the natural sciences, where students sometimes falsify data to make experiments \\"work\\". It includes data falsification, in which false claims are made about research performed, including selective submitting of results to exclude inconvenient data to generating bogus data. Bibliographical references are often fabricated, especially when a certain minimum number of references is required or considered sufficient for the particular kind of paper. This type of fabrication can range from referring to works whose titles look relevant but which the student did not read, to making up bogus titles and authors. There is also the practice of dry-labbing‚Äîwhich can occur in chemistry or other lab courses, in which the teacher clearly expects the experiment to yield certain results (which confirm established laws), so the student starts from the results and works backward, calculating what the experimental data should be, often adding variation to the data. In some cases, the lab report is written before the experiment is conducted‚Äîin some cases, the experiment is never carried out. In either case, the results are what the instructor expects. =Impersonation= Impersonation is a form of cheating whereby a different person than the student assigned an assignment or exam completes it. The academic work is totally 'outsourced' to another person or organization, usually for pay.Ohiomatyc News Contract cheating Contract cheating is similar to impersonation in that a student hires a third party to complete work on their behalf.Clarke, R., & Lancaster, T. (2006). Eliminating the successor to plagiarism: Identifying the usage of contract cheating sites. Paper presented at the Second International Plagiarism Conference, Gateshead, United Kingdom. Essay mills fall under this category. = Plagiarism = Plagiarism, as defined in the 1995 Random House Compact Unabridged Dictionary, is the \\"use or close imitation of the language and thoughts of another author and the representation of them as one's own original work\\".quoted in In academia, this can range from borrowing without attribution a particularly apt phrase, to paraphrasing someone else's original idea without citation, to wholesale contract cheating. The modern concept of plagiarism as immoral and originality as an ideal emerged in Europe only in the 18th century, while in the previous centuries authors and artists were encouraged to \\"copy the masters as closely as possible\\" and avoid \\"unnecessary invention\\".Will, Frederic (1963) Publica materies, in ArionLindey, Alexander (1952) Plagiarism and OriginalityEdward Young (1759) Conjectures on Original Composition The 18th century new morals have been institutionalized and enforced prominently in the sectors of academia (including academic science, education, engineering etc.) and journalism, where plagiarism is now considered academic dishonesty and a breach of journalistic ethics, subject to sanctions like expulsion and other severe career damages. Not so in the arts, which have resisted in their long-established tradition of copying as a fundamental practice of the creative process, with plagiarism being still hugely tolerated by 21st-century artists. Lawmaking is a professional field which is not structured around the concept of originality and for which plagiarism is less relevant. Plagiarism is not a crime but is disapproved more on the grounds of moral offence. It may be a case for civil law if it is so substantial to constitute copyright infringement. Since 2000, discussions on the subjects of student plagiarism have increased with a major strand of this discussion centring on the issue of how best students can be helped to understand and avoid plagiarism. Given the serious consequences that plagiarism has for students there has been a call for a greater emphasis on learning in order to help students avoid committing plagiarism. =Professorial misconduct= Professorial misconduct includes improper grading of students' papers and oral exams, grade fraud, deliberate negligence towards cheating or assistance in cheating. This can be done for reasons of personal bias towards students (favoritism) or a particular viewpoint (intellectual dishonesty), for a bribe, or to improve the teacher's own perceived performance by increasing the passing rate. It is still occasionally done for matters of ego or to procure sexual favors (sexual harassment). =Sabotage= Sabotage is when a student or professor prevents others from completing their work. This includes cutting pages out of library books, deleting data off of classmate's computer or otherwise willfully disrupting the experiments of others. Sabotage is usually only found in highly competitive, cutthroat environments, such as at extremely elite schools where class rankings are highly prized. Poor behavior and the low level disruption of other students' learning, however, is extremely common in all educational settings. Some medical-school librarians have noted that important articles‚Äîrequired reading for key courses‚Äîare frequently missing from bound journals‚Äîsliced out with razor blades, scalpels, or other sharp blades. Other journals will be marked up in crayon. Causes There are a variety of causes of academic misconduct. Researchers have studied the correlation of cheating to personal characteristics, demographics, contextual factors, methods of deterring misconduct, even stages of moral development. =Incentives to cheat= Some scholars contend that there are students who have a pathological urge to cheat. The writer Thomas Mallon noted that many scholars had found plagiarism in literature (Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Charles Reade being two notable examples) to often be perpetrated in a way similar to kleptomania (a psychological disease associated with uncontrollable stealing, even when it is against the interests of the thief).Mallon, 84. On the other hand, Mallon concludes it is probable that most \\"cheaters\\" make a rational choice to commit academic misconduct.Sattler, S., Graeff, P., Willen, S. (2013). \\"Explaining the Decision to Plagiarize: An Empirical Test of the Interplay between Rationality, Norms, and Opportunity\\", Deviant Behavior 34: 444-463 ) A common reason for unethical behavior is the desire to \\"gain a competitive advantage in the race for position or power\\". Richard Fass puts forward the possibility that business scandals in the real world make students believe dishonesty is an acceptable method for achieving success in contemporary society.Richard A. Fass, \\"By Honor Bound: Encouraging Academic Honesty\\", Educational Record 67, no. 4 (Fall 1986), 32. Academic dishonesty, in this case, would be practice for the real world. For some students, there would be a dichotomy between success and honesty, and their decision is that: \\"It is not that we love honesty less, but that we love success more.\\"Bowers, 70. Conversely, other scholars consider that with the recent rise in corporate ethics related dismissals in the business world, this approach to cheating may be losing its appeal, if it ever really had any.Landon Tomas Jr., \\"On Wall Street, a Rise in Dismissals over Ethics\\", New York Times, 29 March 2005 late ed., A1. However, it has been shown that the expected benefits of cheating as well as student's morality plays an important role for the engagement in dishonest behavior.https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED575015 Recent studies have indicated that there is no clear link between academic dishonesty and academic success. One study showed that students given an unexpected opportunity to cheat did not improve their grades significantly from the control group.Whitley and Keith- Spiegel, 35. Another study showed that students who were allowed to bring cheat sheets to a test did not improve their grades. While this may conflict with the common perception of cheating (one survey found only 13% of males and 46% of females think that cheating does not help grades,) it is often apparent to professors and members of academic conduct committees when a paper has been plagiarized by its inferior quality. In the US, William Bowers reported that, on average, one third of grade A students cheated in 1964.Bowers, 74. And asserts that academic dishonesty acts as a shortcut, so even grade A students might be tempted to cheat. He contends that even if a plagiarized paper receives a relatively low grade, that grade is actually high, given how much time and effort went into the paper. In the study mentioned above (in which students were allowed to bring crib sheets to a test but did not improve their scores), the researcher concluded that the students used the crib notes as alternatives to studying, rather than as complements to studying, and thus spent less time preparing for the exam. Teachers The federal government of the United States has mandated high-stakes testing as part of the No Child Left Behind Act, signed into law in 2002. Schools and teachers are held accountable for the results. According to Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner, co-authors of Freakonomics, teachers are known to \\"teach to the test\\": while not teaching the actual answers, they teach the questions and similar ones, and they neglect any topic that will not be tested on. Levitt also states that teachers may inflate the results of tests given in their classroom. Teachers and librarians can have a significant proactive impact on doing honest work. =Demographic and personal causes= Research has identified a number of demographic characteristics that appear to be important influences on cheating, including age, gender and grade point average.Donald L. McCabe and Linda Klebe Trevino, \\"Individual and Contextual Influences on Academic Dishonesty: A Multicampus Investigation\\", Research in Higher Education 38, no. 2, (1997), 380. Older students, females, and students with higher academic achievementJude Carroll, A Handbook for Deterring Plagiarism in Higher Education(Oxford: The Oxford Centre for Staff and Learning Development, 2002), 18. are less likely to cheat, whereas students involved with many extra-curricular activities are more likely to do so. Students involved in extra-curricular activities may be less committed to their studies, or may have more demands on their time, which interfere with their studies, creating a greater incentive to cheat. It has been found that younger students are somewhat more likely to cheat: one study finding the highest incidence of cheating occurs during sophomore year at college.Kenneth J. Smith, Jeanette A. Davy, and Debbie Easterling, \\"An Examination of Cheating and its Antecedents Among Marketing and Management Majors\\", The Journal of Business Ethics50, no. 1, (March 2004), 66. Although cheating might be expected to decline with greater moral development, one experiment found that there was no relationship between how a student performed on a morality test and his likelihood of cheating (that is, students at a pre-conventional stage of morality are as likely to cheat as those at a post-conventional stage).Tim West, Sue Ravenscroft, and Charles Shrader, \\"Cheating and Moral Judgment in the College Classroom: A Natural Experiment\\", Journal of Business Ethics 54, no. 2, (October 2004), 181. Higher academic procrastination was also found to increase the frequency of seven different forms of academic misconduct (using fraudulent excuses, plagiarism, copying from someone else in exams, using forbidden means in exams, carrying forbidden means into exams, copying parts of homework from others, and fabrication or falsification of data) as well as the variety of academic misconduct. This German panel study among thousands of university students argues that academic misconduct might be a coping-strategy to overcome the negative consequences of academic procrastination such as lower performance. Race, nationality, and class all show little correlation with academic misconduct. There is also no correlation between how religious someone is and the likelihood that that person will cheat. A comparison between students of different religions yielded similar results, although the study did show that Jews tend to cheat less than members of other religions.Bowers, 207 One of the strongest demographic correlations with academic misconduct in the United States is with language. Students who speak English as a second language have been shown to commit academic dishonesty more and are more likely to be caught than native speakers, since they will often not want to rewrite sources in their own words, fearing that the meaning of the sentence will be lost through poor paraphrasing skills.Carroll, 21. Universities in the United Kingdom =Contextual causes= Academic misconduct is more easily traced to the academic and social environment of students than to their background. These contextual factors can be as broad as the social milieu at school to as narrow as what instructions a teacher gives before an exam. Contextual factors that individual teachers can affect often make the least difference on cheating behavior. A study found that increasing the distance between students taking an exam has little effect on academic misconduct, and that threatening students before an exam with expulsion if they cheat actually promotes cheating behavior.Joe Kerkvliet and Charles L. Sigmund, \\"Can We Control Cheating in the Classroom?\\", The Journal of Economic Education 30, no. 4, (Autumn, 1999), 331. Indeed, increased exam proctoring and other methods of detecting cheating in the classroom are largely ineffective. According to one survey of American college students, while 50% had cheated at least once in the previous six months, and 7% had cheated more than five times in that period, only 2.5% of the cheaters had been caught. As teachers invent more elaborate methods of deterring cheating, students invent even more elaborate methods of cheating (sometimes even treating it as a game), leading to what some teachers call a costly and unwinnable arms race.Carrol, 61. Increased punishment for academic misconduct also has little correlation with cheating behavior. It has been found that students with markedly different perceptions of what the severity of the punishment for cheating were all equally likely to cheat, probably indicating that they thought that increased penalties were immaterial since their cheating would never be discovered.Douglas N. Bunn, Steven B. Caudill, and Daniel M. Gropper, \\"Crime in the Classroom: An Economic Analysis of Undergraduate Student Cheating Behavior\\", The Journal of Economic Education 23, no. 3, (Summer 1992), 205. However, if a professor makes clear that he disapproves of cheating, either in the syllabus, in the first class, or at the beginning of a test, academic dishonesty can drop by 12%. Some professors may have little incentive to reduce cheating in their classes below a point that would otherwise be obvious to outside observers, as they are rated by how many research papers they publish and research grants they win for the college, and not by how well they teach. Teachers can, however, accidentally promote cheating behavior. A study found a correlation between how harsh or unfair a professor is perceived as and academic misconduct, since students see cheating as a way of getting back at the teacher.Bushway and Nash, 628. Also, students who see themselves in a competition, such as when the teacher is using a grade curve, are more likely to cheat.Bernard E. Whitley, \\"Factors Associated with Cheating Among College Students: A Review\\", Research in Higher Education 39, no. 3, (June, 1998), 252. Research has also shown a correlation between goal orientation and the occurrence of academic cheating. Students who perceive their classroom to have high mastery goals are less likely to engage in cheating than those who perceive their classroom to emphasize performance goals.Anderman, E., & Midgley, C. (2004). Changes in self-reported academic cheating across the transition from middle school to high school. Contemporary Educational Psychology, 29, 499-517. In other words, students who are encouraged to learn for the sake of learning and who exhibit an intrinsic value of education are less likely to cheat than those who are encouraged primarily by grades and other extrinsic rewards. The most important contextual causes of academic misconduct are often out of individual teachers' hands. One very important factor is time management. One survey reported two-thirds of teachers believed that poor time management was the principal cause of cheating. Often social engagements are to blame. It has been found that there is a strong correlation between extracurricular activities and cheating, especially among athletes, even those on intramural teams.McCabe and Trevino, \\"Multicampus Investigation\\", 382. It has also been found that student cheating rates rise significantly the more time students spend playing cards, watching television, or having a few drinks with friends.Bowers, 104. Relatedly, fraternity or sorority membership is also strongly correlated with academic misconduct.McCabe and Trevino, \\"Multicampus Investigation\\", 383. One of the most important causes of academic misconduct is the contextual factor of an environment of peer disapproval of cheating, that is, peer pressure. Psychologists note that all people tend to follow the norms of their peer group, which would include norms about academic dishonesty.F. Clark Power, Ann Higgins, and Lawrence Kohlberg, Lawrence Kohlberg's Approach to Moral Education (New York: Columbia University Press, 1989), 214. Thus, students who believe that their peers disapprove of cheating are less likely to cheat. Indeed, multiple studies show that the most decisive factor in a student's decision to cheat is his perception of his peers' relationship with academic dishonesty. For instance, on average 69% of students cheat at colleges with low community disapproval of academic misconduct, whereas only about 23% of students cheat at colleges with strong community disapproval of academic misconduct. Peer pressure works both ways, as a study found that there is a 41% increase in the probability of a student cheating if he or she has seen someone else cheat.Bunn, Caudill, and Gropper, 204. However, even if most students strongly disapprove of cheating, there has to be a community in order for those norms to be enforced via peer pressure. For instance, larger schools, which usually have much higher cheating rates than small schools, tend to have a weaker community, being more split up into different peer groups that exert little social pressure on each other.Bowers, 199. Another measure of a college community, how many students live on campus, further shows a significant relation with a school's cheating rate.Bowers, 169. Relatedly, many professors argue that smaller classes reduce cheating behavior.Donald L. McCabe, Linda Klebe Trevino, and Donald L. Butterfield, \\"Honor Code and Other Contextual Influences on Academic Integrity: A Replication and Extension to Modified Honor Code Settings\\" Research in Higher Education 43, no. 3, (June 2002), 368. =Ethical causes= No matter what the demographic or contextual influences are on a student who decides to engage in cheating behavior, before they can cheat they must overcome their own conscience. This depends both on how strongly someone disapproves of academic dishonesty and what types of justifications the student uses to escape a sense of guilt. For instance, students who personally do not have a moral problem with academic misconduct can cheat guilt-free. However, while many students have been taught and have internalized that academic dishonesty is wrong, it has been shown that on average a third of students who strongly disapprove of cheating have in fact cheated.Bowers, 72. People who cheat despite personal disapproval of cheating engage in something called \\"neutralization\\", in which a student rationalizes the cheating as being acceptable due to certain mitigating circumstances. According to psychologists of deviant behavior, people who engage in neutralization support the societal norm in question, but \\"conjure up\\" reasons why they are allowed to violate that norm in a particular case. Neutralization is not a simple case of ex post facto rationalization, but is rather a more comprehensive affair, occurring before, during, and after the act of cheating.LaBeff, et al., 191. Researchers have found four major types of neutralization of academic dishonesty, which they categorize by type of justification. Denial of responsibility ‚Äì that is, the accusation that others are to blame or that something forced the student to cheat ‚Äì is the most common form of neutralization among college students who cheated, with 61% of cheaters using this form of justification. Condemnation of condemner ‚Äì that is, that the professors are hypocrites or brought it on themselves ‚Äì is the second most common form of college student neutralization at 28%. The third most popular form of neutralization among college students is the appeal to higher loyalties, where the student thinks their responsibility to some other entity, usually their peers, is more important than doing what they know to be morally right. About 6.8% of cheaters in higher education use this form of neutralization. Denial of injury ‚Äì thinking that nobody is worse off for the cheating ‚Äì is the fourth most popular kind of neutralization at 4.2% of cheaters. Effects Cheating in academics has a host of effects on students, on teachers, on individual schools, and on the educational system itself. For instance, students who engage in neutralisation to justify cheating, even once, are more likely to engage in it in the future, potentially putting them on a road to a life of dishonesty. Indeed, one study found that students who are dishonest in class are more likely to engage in fraud and theft on the job when they enter the workplace.Sarath Nonis and Cathy Owens Swift, \\"An Examination of the Relationship between Academic Dishonesty and Workplace Dishonesty\\", Journal of Business Education 77, no. 2, (November‚ÄìDecember 2001), 69-77. Students are also negatively affected by academic dishonesty after graduation. A university diploma is an important document in the labor market. Potential employers use a degree as a representation of a graduate's knowledge and ability. However, due to academic dishonesty, not all graduates with the same grades actually did the same work or have the same skills. Thus, when faced with the fact that they do not know which graduates are skilled and which are the \\"lemons\\" (see \\"The Market for Lemons\\"), employers must pay all graduates based on the quality of the average graduate. Therefore, the more students who cheat, getting by without achieving the required skills or learning, the lower the quality of the average graduate of a school, and thus the less employers are willing to pay a new hire from that school. Because of this reason, all students, even those that do not cheat themselves, are negatively affected by academic misconduct. Academic dishonesty also creates problems for teachers. In economic terms, cheating causes an underproduction of knowledge, where the professor's job is to produce knowledge.Bunn, Caudill, and Gropper, 199. Moreover, a case of cheating often will cause emotional distress to faculty members, many considering it to be a personal slight against them or a violation of their trust. Dealing with academic misconduct is often one of the worst parts of a career in education, one survey claiming that 77% of academics agreed with the statement \\"dealing with a cheating student is one of the most onerous aspects of the job\\".Whitley and Keith- Spiegel, 11. Academic misconduct can also have an effect on a college's reputation, one of the most important assets of any school. An institution plagued by cheating scandals may become less attractive to potential donors and students and especially prospective employers. Alternatively, schools with low levels of academic dishonesty can use their reputation to attract students and employers. Ultimately, academic dishonesty undermines the academic world. It interferes with the basic mission of education, the transfer of knowledge, by allowing students to get by without having to master the knowledge.Whitley and Keith-Spiegel, 5. Furthermore, academic dishonesty creates an atmosphere that is not conducive to the learning process, which affects honest students as well.Bowers, 2. When honest students see cheaters escape detection, it can discourage student morale, as they see the rewards for their work cheapened. Cheating also undermines academia when students steal ideas. Ideas are a professional author's \\"capital and identity\\", and if a person's ideas are stolen it retards the pursuit of knowledge. If never formally retracted, fraudulent publications can remain an issue for many years as articles and books remain on shelves and continue to be cited. The case of S. Walter Poulshock, a 1960s early-career historian whose work was found to contain wholly fabricated material, was exposed in 1966 with the American Historical Review providing a warning on the topic. Nonetheless, his book was never removed from the shelves of many university libraries and (together with his related thesis) was still being cited in 2013, 47 years after it was intended to have been withdrawn by its publisher. Deterrence All parties involved in the dishonesty--not just the individual whose grade is increased by it--can be punished. Historically the job of preventing cheating has been given to the teacher. It used to be that in college the professor acted in loco parentis and was able to regulate student behavior as a parent.\\"Richard J. Hardy and David Burch, \\"What Political Science Professors Should Know in Dealing with Academic Dishonesty\\", Teaching Political Science 9, no. 2 (Fall 1981), 6. Thus, professors who discovered cheating could assign essentially any punishment they deemed appropriate. Students often had no mechanism for appeal. Generally, proctors were hired to patrol exams. If a case was particularly serious, a dean or other top-level administrator might have been involved. Against this inconsistent and paternalistic system, students at some schools rebelled and demanded to be treated as adults. =Honor codes= First at the College of William and Mary in 1779, and then followed by schools like the University of Virginia in the 1850s and Wesleyan University in 1893, the students, with the agreement of faculty who declared themselves dedicated to ideals of democracy and human character, created honor codes.Joseph Roy Geiger, The Honor System in Colleges (Williamsburg, VA: College of William and Mary, 1937), 5. B. Melendez of Harvard University defined an honor code as a code of academic conduct that includes a written pledge of honesty that students sign, a student controlled judiciary that hears alleged violations, unproctored examinations, and an obligation for all students help enforce the code.Donald L. McCabe, Linda Klebe Trevino, and Kenneth D. Butterfield, \\"Academic Integrity in Honor Code and Non-Honor Code Environments: A Qualitative Investigation\\", The Journal of Higher Education 70, no. 2 (March‚ÄìApril 1999), 213. This system relied on student self-enforcement, which was considered more becoming of young gentlemen than the policing by proctors and professors that existed previously. Of interest, the military academies of the US took the honor code one step further than civilian colleges, disallowing \\"tolerance\\", which means that if a cadet or midshipman is found to have failed to report or outright protected someone engaged in academic dishonesty (as well as other dishonesties or stealing), that individual is to be expelled along with the perpetrator. =Mixed judicial boards= However, many people doubted the advisability of relying on an abstract notion of honor to prevent academic dishonesty. This doubt has perhaps led to the reality that no more than a quarter of American universities have adopted honor codes.Bowers, 184. Moreover, many professors could not envisage a student run trial process that treated faculty accusers fairly. In response to these concerns, in the middle of the twentieth century, many schools devised mixed judicial panels composed of both students and faculty. This type of academic integrity system was similar to the traditional faculty control system in that it relied on professors to detect cheating, except in this system cheaters were brought before centralized boards of students and faculty for punishment. By the 1960s over a quarter of American universities had adopted this system of mixed judicial boards. Still, though, over half of American universities continued to use faculty-centered control systems. =Student due process rights= Starting in the 1960s, the U.S. Supreme Court began chipping away at the in loco parentis doctrine, giving college students more civil liberties such as the right of due process in disciplinary proceedings (Dixon v. Alabama Board of Education, 1961). In Cooper v. Blair (1973), specifically academic misconduct was ruled to require due process, being a disciplinary matter and not an educational matter. The due process rights of students in academic misconduct cases is not to the same degree as in a court of law. For instance, the student has no right to representation and the burden of proof is not necessarily stringent. In the \\"General Order on Judicial Standards of Procedure and Substance in Review of Student Discipline in Tax Supported Institutions of Higher Education\\", (1968) student due process rights were laid out as follows: > # The student should be given adequate notice in writing of the specific > ground or grounds and the nature of the evidence on which the discipline > proceedings are based. # The student should be given an opportunity for a > hearing in which the disciplinary authority provides a fair opportunity for > hearing of the student's position, explanations, or evidence. # No > disciplinary action may be taken on grounds which are not supported by any > substantial evidence. These new rules put an end to the old faculty-based system of policing academic dishonesty, now students were entitled to an impartial hearing. While schools using the old honor code method or the mixed judicial system were not affected by these decisions, schools using the faculty based system generally instituted systems that relied on a committee of faculty and administrators or a dean to run the academic misconduct hearings. =Modified honor codes= Recently, Donald L. McCabe and Linda Klebe Trevino, two experts in the field of academic dishonesty, have proposed a new way of deterring cheating that has been implemented in schools such as the University of Maryland. Modified honor codes put students in charge of the judicial hearing process, making it clear that it is the students' responsibility to stop cheating amongst themselves, but at the same time students still have proctored exams and are not allowed to take pledges of good conduct in place of professor oversight.McCabe, Trevino and Butterfield, \\"Modified Honor Code\\" 357. The researchers who advocate this type of code seem to think that the normal honor code is something of a special case that is not applicable to many schools.McCabe, Trevino and Butterfield, \\"Modified Honor Code\\", 362. According to supporters of this system, schools with a large student body, a weak college community, or no history of student self-governance will not be able to support a full honor code. However, while modified honor codes seem to be more effective than faculty or administration run integrity codes of conduct, research shows that schools with modified codes still have higher rates of cheating than schools with full honor codes.McCabe, Trevino and Butterfield, \\"Modified Honor Code\\", 372. =Comparison of different systems of enforcement= Research has shown that there is a strong correlation between forms of academic integrity system and levels of cheating at a school. Several studies have found students who attend schools with honor codes are less likely to cheat than students at schools with traditional integrity codes. Another study found that only 28% of schools with honor codes have high levels of cheating, whereas 81% of schools with mixed judicial boards have high rates of cheating. Whereas faculty or administration run codes of conduct tend to rely on policing and punishment to deter students from cheating, honor codes tend to rely on and cultivate student senses of honor and group peer pressure to deter academic misconduct.McCabe and Trevino, \\"Multicampus Investigation\\", 384. As mentioned above in the section on causes of cheating, increased enforcement or punishment is rarely effective at discouraging cheating, whereas there is a high correlation between peer pressure and academic honesty. The modified honor code attempts to cultivate peer disapproval of cheating while maintaining the traditional proctor system, although critics argue that the proctor system undermines the creation of an atmosphere of student self- policing, reducing the effectiveness of the honor code, possibly explaining why modified honor codes have not been as effective as the original version. =Faculty issues in deterring academic dishonesty= There are limitations to relying on the faculty to police academic dishonesty. One study found that up to 21% of professors have ignored at least one clear cut case of cheating.Whitley and Keith-Spiegel, 8. Another study revealed that 40% of professors \\"never\\" report cheating, 54% \\"seldom\\" report cheating, and that a mere 6% act on all cases of academic misconduct that confront them.Schneider, A8. A third survey of professors found that while 79% had observed cheating, only 9% had penalized the student.Donald L. McCabe, Kenneth D. Butterfield, and Linda Klebe Trevino, \\"Faculty and Academic Integrity: The Influence of Current Honor Codes and Past Honor Code Experiences,\\" Research in Higher Education 44, no. 3 (June 2003), 368. According to a manual for professors on cheating, > the reasons for this lack of action include unwillingness to devote time and > energy to the issue, reluctance to undergo an emotional confrontation, and > fear of retaliation by the student, of losing students, of being accused of > harassment or discrimination, and even of being sued for these offenses > and/or defamation of character. There are other reasons as well. Some professors are reluctant to report violations to the appropriate authorities because they believe the punishment to be too harsh.Alison Schneider, \\"Why Professors Don't Do More to Stop Students who Cheat,\\" Chronicle of Higher Education, 22 January 1999, A9. Some professors may have little incentive to reduce cheating in their classes below a point that would otherwise be obvious to outside observers, as they are rated by how many research papers they publish and research grants they win for the college, and not by how well they teach. Others do not report academic misconduct because of postmodernist views on cheating. Postmodernism calls into question the very concepts of \\"authorship\\" and \\"originality.\\" From the perspective of cultural studies and historicism, authors themselves are simply constructs of their social surroundings, and thus they simply rewrite already written cultural stories. Moreover, in the field of composition studies, students are being encouraged more and more to do group work and participate in ongoing collective revision. The postmodernist view is that \\"the concept of intellectual malpractice is of limited epistemological value. Under the ironic gaze of postmodernism, the distinctions between guilt and innocence, integrity and deceit permeating the scandal debates appear irrelevant.\\"Ron Robin, Scandals and Scoundrels: Seven Cases that Shook the Academy. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004), 222. However, there is an argument that postmodernism is just moral relativism, therefore cheating is condoned as a valid academic method, even if it is morally and legally wrong. One professor wrote in an article in The English Journal that when he peeked in on an unproctored class taking a test and saw several students up and consulting with one another, he decided that they were not cheating, but were using non- traditional techniques and collaborative learning to surmount the obstacles teachers had put in their way.Kevin Davis, \\"Student Cheating: A Defensive Essay,\\" The English Journal 81, no. 6 (October 1992), 72. Issues of cultural relativism also affect professors' views on cheating; the standard objection being that \\"students from certain Middle Eastern, Asian, and African cultures are baffled by the notion that one can 'own' ideas, since their cultures regard words and ideas as the property of all rather than as individual property\\".S.H. McLeod quoted in Whitley, 20. Another issue teachers may have with deterring cheating is that they may decide that it is not their job. The argument that \\"they're professors, not policemen\\" is often heard in academia. In economic terms, some professors believe they are being paid to provide learning, and if the student loses that learning through cheating, he is only cheating himself out of the money he paid.Decoo, 152. Exposure of falsified data With the advancement of the internet, there are now several tools available to aid in the detection of plagiarism and multiple publication within biomedical literature. One tool developed in 2006 by researchers in Harold Garner's laboratory at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas is D√©j√† Vu, an open-access database containing several thousand instances of duplicate publication.

There are three pillars of the religion, of which the key concept is johrei, claimed to be a method of channeling divine light into the body of another for the purposes of healing. The Art of Nature which includes nature farming, and the Art of Beauty which includes practices such as Ikebana, a form of Japanese flower arranging, are the other formal practices. In 1926, Okada claimed to have received a divine revelation that empowered him to be a channel of God's Healing Light (johrei) to purify spiritual realm to remove the spiritual causes of illness, poverty, and strife from the world and inaugurate a new Messianic Age. He went on to teach Johrei to his followers allowing them also to achieve Messianity and spread the teachings across the world. Members are given permission to channel Johrei by wearing an O-Hikari pendant which contains a copy of one of Mokichi Okada's calligraphies. He is often referred to as \\"Meishu-Sama\\" (Lord of Light) by his followers. Okada's teaching is represented by a number of his works, such as Foundation of Paradise and Johrei: Divine Light of Salvation, which has been edited and translated by the Society of Johrei, an offshoot of COWM. The movement currently claims 800,000 followers, including many in Brazil. Shinji Shumeikai , also known as Shumei, also follows the teachings of Okada and is considered a descendant of the church by CFAR. According to anthropologist of religion Winston Davis, Mahikari groups are comparable to Church of World Messianity and follow basically the same healing ritual.  In Brazil  Church of World Messianity in Guarapiranga Brazil has the largest concentration of Japanese and people of Japanese descent outside Japan. According to Hideaki Matsuoka, University of California, Berkeley, in a presentation at the Summer 2000 Asian Studies Conference Japan entitled \\"Messianity Makes the Person Useful: Describing Differences in a Japanese Religion in Brazil,\\" Japanese new religions have propagated in Brazil since the 1930s and they now have at least a million non-Japanese Brazilian followers. Four major religions ranked by the number of followers are Seicho-no-Ie, Messianity, Mahikari and PL Kyodan. In Brazil, Guarapiranga is the sacred place of the Church of World Messianity ().

(contains nudity) She was murdered at the age of 24. Life and career =Early life= Nozomi Momoi was born in Tokyo on September 23, 1978. She attended junior high school in Nagano Prefecture, and remained in touch with friends there, visiting them on vacation, for the rest of her life. Before beginning work in the AV field, Nozomi worked in what she called \\"a very normal job.\\" Describing her daily routine at this time, she said, \\"I used to wake up at 5:30 in the morning to get ready for work and I didn't have time to put on make-up or do my hair... It was the type of job where I was alone most of the time so I didn't bother with it.\\" She wanted a different lifestyle, and to make more money, but she was unable to decide what sort of work she wanted to do. She was in this frame of mind when she was scouted by a representative of the AV industry in Tokyo's Shinjuku neighborhood. =AV debut= When she made her AV debut in April 2001 with Dogma, AV director Tohjiro's advice to Nozomi was, \\"You should be a bit more perverted.\\" Nozomi claimed that she took this advice to heart and that it helped her to be less inhibited both on screen and off. In December of her debut year, Nozomi was the star of the fourth entry in VIP studios' documentary-style Monthly series. Her January 2002 video for the Media Station Bazooka label, Virtual Brothel, had Nozomi playing the role of a young prostitute who learns the trade from the more experienced Yukari Sakurada. Viewers were invited to compare Sakurada's veteran technique with Nozomi's fresh innocence. Nozomi enjoyed her new occupation. About her early videos, Nozomi recalled, \\"I was having so much fun at first that I didn't feel tired at all.\\" Unlike many AV actresses who are happy to have time off, Nozomi became known for actively seeking out new chances to perform. In May 2002, Nozomi appeared in the third entry of the Forceful Exhibitionistic-Play Maniax video series. In this video, Nozomi and two other AV actresses engage in exhibitionistic acts at a pachinko parlor, a public park, and an office building. =Later career= Towards the end of her life, she had become tired of the rape themes and school-girl roles which were common in her videos, but she enjoyed the fact that she was getting more dominant roles in her later AVs. \\"Making men play along to me is something new so it's fun to do. I think that's the type of thing I want to do more of.\\" Nozomi's July, 2002 video release, Popular Actresses Fucking Virgin Boys, was in this genre. As the title implied, the video had Nozomi and two other AV actresses have sex with amateur virgin males, including a college student and a middle-aged man. Her video Home Delivery Call Girl, from August 2002, worked with a similar documentary-style concept. In this case, the actress appears at a male amateur's home to perform sex with him. A posthumously-released compilation DVD released by CineMagic from 2006, entitled La Vie En Nose, includes one of Nozomi's videos from 2002. This was the first in a series of DVDs focusing on a nose fetish, indicating that Nozomi had worked in that genre also. Nozomi continued to enjoy sex both within and outside of the AV setting, and stated that she did not mind having it every day. Nevertheless, the intense pace of her career was beginning to tire her. She had been making up to ten videos a month, and expressed fatigue with the AV work both in interviews and in private conversations. She told an interviewer, \\"...it was a lot of fun at first, but I'm really tired nowadays. To tell you the truth, I think I'm over- exerting myself right now. So I want to take a decent vacation rather than get paid.\\" She continued, \\"Like I said before, I enjoy the shoots a lot. There are times when I think it's hard and tiring, but the fun part is a lot greater!\\" A friend later reported that Nozomi was planning to get married, quit the AV industry and become a stage actress. Nozomi also formed an idol musical group with some other AV idols and released a musical CD in 2002. =Death= Nozomi's career was still on the rise when her life came to a sudden end while visiting Nagano Prefecture. On October 12, 2002, she was found dead by the Narai River, which runs through Shiojiri. A nearby burned-out car contained the remains of her male companion. Nozomi had been stabbed at least six times, covered with gasoline and set on fire about 10 meters from the car. It was reported that Nozomi's companion was a company employee in Nagano Prefecture, and that in what the police called a possible murder-suicide pact, the man had burned himself to death inside the car. The remains were so badly charred that it took hours of testing before investigators could even determine that the remains belonged to a male. According to the Mainichi Shimbun, \\"Nozomi seemed to have something Japan's myriad other porno starlets lacked and, at just 24, she was on her way up in the world before her tragic end.\\" In the months after the incident, the parents of Momoi's male companion objected to the murder- suicide theory and many inconsistencies were pointed out. His parents unsuccessfully brought a case against the local police and when their insurance company refused to pay because of their son's supposed suicide, they sued Sumitomo Life Insurance. In October 2006, the civil court at Nagano ruled in favor of the parents that the two deaths were due to murder by a third party. No further progress had been made in the criminal case.

The crisis began almost immediately after the Congo became independent from Belgium and ended, unofficially, with the entire country under the rule of Joseph-D√©sir√© Mobutu. Constituting a series of civil wars, the Congo Crisis was also a proxy conflict in the Cold War, in which the Soviet Union and the United States supported opposing factions. Around 100,000 people are believed to have been killed during the crisis. A nationalist movement in the Belgian Congo demanded the end of colonial rule: this led to the country's independence on 30 June 1960. Minimal preparations had been made and many issues, such as federalism, tribalism, and ethnic nationalism, remained unresolved. In the first week of July, a mutiny broke out in the army and violence erupted between black and white civilians. Belgium sent troops to protect fleeing whites. Katanga and South Kasai seceded with Belgian support. Amid continuing unrest and violence, the United Nations deployed peacekeepers, but UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj√∂ld refused to use these troops to help the central government in L√©opoldville fight the secessionists. Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, the charismatic leader of the largest nationalist faction, reacted by calling for assistance from the Soviet Union, which promptly sent military advisers and other support. The involvement of the Soviets split the Congolese government and led to an impasse between Lumumba and President Joseph Kasa-Vubu. Mobutu, in command of the army, broke this deadlock with a coup d'√©tat, expelled the Soviet advisors and established a new government effectively under his own control. Lumumba was taken captive and subsequently executed in 1961. A rival government of the \\"Free Republic of the Congo\\" was founded in the eastern city of Stanleyville by Lumumba supporters led by Antoine Gizenga. It gained Soviet support but was crushed in early 1962. Meanwhile, the UN took a more aggressive stance towards the secessionists after Hammarskj√∂ld was killed in a plane crash in late 1961. Supported by UN troops, L√©opoldville defeated secessionist movements in Katanga and South Kasai by the start of 1963. With Katanga and South Kasai back under the government's control, a reconciliatory compromise constitution was adopted and the exiled Katangese leader, Mo√Øse Tshombe, was recalled to head an interim administration while fresh elections were organised. Before these could be held, however, Maoist-inspired militants calling themselves the \\"Simbas\\" rose up in the east of the country. The Simbas took control of a significant amount of territory and proclaimed a communist \\"People's Republic of the Congo\\" in Stanleyville. Government forces gradually retook territory and, in November 1964, Belgium and the United States intervened militarily in Stanleyville to recover hostages from Simba captivity. The Simbas were defeated and collapsed soon after. Following the elections in March 1965, a new political stalemate developed between Tshombe and Kasa-Vubu, forcing the government into near- paralysis. Mobutu mounted a second coup d'√©tat in November 1965, taking personal control of the country. Under Mobutu's rule, the Congo (renamed Zaire in 1971) was transformed into a dictatorship which would endure until his deposition in 1997. Background =Belgian rule= The Belgian Congo, today the Democratic Republic of the Congo, highlighted on a map of Africa Colonial rule in the Congo began in the late 19th century. King Leopold II of Belgium, frustrated by Belgium's lack of international power and prestige, attempted to persuade the Belgian government to support colonial expansion around the then- largely unexplored Congo Basin. The Belgian government's ambivalence about the idea led Leopold to eventually create the colony on his own account. With support from a number of Western countries, who viewed Leopold as a useful buffer between rival colonial powers, Leopold achieved international recognition for a personal colony, the Congo Free State, in 1885. By the turn of the century, however, the violence of Free State officials against indigenous Congolese and the ruthless system of economic extraction had led to intense diplomatic pressure on Belgium to take official control of the country, which it did in 1908, creating the Belgian Congo. Belgian rule in the Congo was based around the \\"colonial trinity\\" (trinit√© coloniale) of state, missionary and private company interests. The privileging of Belgian commercial interests meant that capital sometimes flowed back into the Congo and that individual regions became specialised. On many occasions, the interests of the government and private enterprise became closely tied and the state helped companies with strikebreaking and countering other efforts by the indigenous population to better their lot. The country was split into nesting, hierarchically organised administrative subdivisions, and run uniformly according to a set \\"native policy\\" (politique indig√®ne)‚Äîin contrast to the British and the French, who generally favoured the system of indirect rule whereby traditional leaders were retained in positions of authority under colonial oversight. There was also a high degree of racial segregation. Large numbers of white immigrants who moved to the Congo after the end of World War II came from across the social spectrum, but were nonetheless always treated as superior to blacks. During the 1940s and 1950s, the Congo experienced an unprecedented level of urbanisation and the colonial administration began various development programmes aimed at making the territory into a \\"model colony\\". One of the results of the measures was the development of a new middle class of Europeanised African \\"√©volu√©s\\" in the cities. By the 1950s the Congo had a wage labour force twice as large as that in any other African colony. The Congo's rich natural resources, including uranium‚Äîmuch of the uranium used by the U.S. nuclear programme during World War II was Congolese‚Äîled to substantial interest in the region from both the Soviet Union and the United States as the Cold War developed. =Politics and radicalisation= An African nationalist movement developed in the Belgian Congo during the 1950s, primarily among the √©volu√©s. The movement was divided into a number of parties and groups which were broadly divided on ethnic and geographical lines and opposed to one another. The largest, the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC), was a united front organisation dedicated to achieving independence \\"within a reasonable\\" time. It was created around a charter which was signed by, among others, Patrice Lumumba, Cyrille Adoula and Joseph Il√©o, but others accused the party of being too moderate. Lumumba became a leading figure within the MNC, and by the end of 1959, the party claimed to have 58,000 members. The leader of ABAKO, Joseph Kasa-Vubu, who later became the independent Congo's first President The MNC's main rival was the Alliance des Bakongo (ABAKO), led by Joseph Kasa-Vubu, who advocated a more radical ideology than the MNC, based around calls for immediate independence and the promotion of regional identity. ABAKO's stance was more ethnic nationalist than the MNC's; it argued that an independent Congo should be run by the Bakongo as inheritors of the pre-colonial Kingdom of the Kongo. The Conf√©d√©ration des Associations Tribales du Katanga (CONAKAT), a localist party led by Mo√Øse Tshombe, was the third major organisation; it advocated federalism and primarily represented the southern province of Katanga. These were joined by a number of smaller parties which emerged as the nationalist movement developed, including the radical Parti Solidaire Africain (PSA), and factions representing the interests of minor ethnic groups like the Alliance des Bayanzi (ABAZI). Although it was the largest of the African nationalist parties, the MNC had many different factions within it that took differing stances on a number of issues. It was increasingly polarised between moderate √©volu√©s and the more radical mass membership. A radical faction headed by Il√©o and Albert Kalonji split away in July 1959, but failed to induce mass defections by other MNC members. The dissident faction became known as the MNC-Kalonji (MNC-K), while the majority group became the MNC-Lumumba (MNC-L). The split divided the party's support base into those who remained with Lumumba, chiefly in the Stanleyville region in the north-east, and those who backed the MNC-K, which became most popular around the southern city of √âlisabethville and among the Luba ethnic group. Major riots broke out in L√©opoldville, the Congolese capital, on 4 January 1959 after a political demonstration turned violent. The Force Publique, the colonial gendarmerie, used force against the rioters‚Äîat least 49 people were killed, and total casualties may have been as high as 500. The nationalist parties' influence expanded outside the major cities for the first time, and nationalist demonstrations and riots became a regular occurrence over the next year, bringing large numbers of black people from outside the √©volu√© class into the independence movement. Many blacks began to test the boundaries of the colonial system by refusing to pay taxes or abide by minor colonial regulations. The bulk of the ABAKO leadership was arrested, leaving the MNC in an advantageous position. These developments led to the white community also becoming increasing radicalised. Some whites planned to attempt a coup d'√©tat if a black majority government took power. As law and order began to break down, white civilians formed militia groups known as Corps de Voluntaires Europ√©ens (\\"European Volunteer Corps\\") to police their neighbourhoods. These militias frequently attacked blacks. =Independence= In the fallout from the L√©opoldville riots, the report of a Belgian parliamentary working group on the future of the Congo was published in which a strong demand for \\"internal autonomy\\" was noted. August de Schryver, the Minister of the Colonies, launched a high-profile Round Table Conference in Brussels in January 1960, with the leaders of all the major Congolese parties in attendance. Lumumba, who had been arrested following riots in Stanleyville, was released in the run-up to the conference and headed the MNC-L delegation. The Belgian government had hoped for a period of at least 30 years before independence, but Congolese pressure at the conference led to 30 June 1960 being set as the date. Issues including federalism, ethnicity and the future role of Belgium in Congolese affairs were left unresolved after the delegates failed to reach agreement. Patrice Lumumba, leader of the MNC-L and first Prime Minister, pictured in Brussels at the Round Table Conference of 1960 Belgians began campaigning against Lumumba, whom they wanted to marginalise; they accused him of being a communist and, hoping to fragment the nationalist movement, supported rival, ethnic-based parties like CONAKAT. Many Belgians hoped that an independent Congo would form part of a federation, like the French Community or British Commonwealth of Nations, and that close economic and political association with Belgium would continue. As independence approached, the Belgian government organised Congolese elections in May 1960. These resulted in an MNC relative majority. The proclamation of the independent Republic of the Congo, and the end of colonial rule, occurred as planned on 30 June 1960. In a ceremony at the Palais de la Nation in L√©opoldville, King Baudouin gave a speech in which he presented the end of colonial rule in the Congo as the culmination of the Belgian \\"civilising mission\\" begun by Leopold II. After the King's address, Lumumba gave an unscheduled speech in which he angrily attacked colonialism and described independence as the crowning success of the nationalist movement. Although Lumumba's address was acclaimed by figures such as Malcolm X, it nearly provoked a diplomatic incident with Belgium; even some Congolese politicians perceived it as unnecessarily provocative. Nevertheless, independence was celebrated across the Congo. Politically, the new state had a semi-presidential constitution, known as the Loi Fondamentale, in which executive power was shared between President and Prime Minister in a system known as bicephalisme. Kasa-Vubu was proclaimed President, and Lumumba Prime Minister, of the Republic of the Congo. Despite the objections of CONAKAT and others, the constitution was largely centralist, concentrating power in the central government in L√©opoldville, and did not devolve significant powers to provincial level. Beginning of the crisis =Force Publique mutiny, racial violence and Belgian intervention= Despite the proclamation of independence, neither the Belgian nor the Congolese government intended the colonial social order to end immediately. The Belgian government hoped that whites might keep their position indefinitely. The Republic of the Congo was still reliant on colonial institutions like the Force Publique to function from day to day, and white technical experts, installed by the Belgians, were retained in the broad absence of suitably qualified black Congolese replacements (partly the result of colonial restrictions regarding higher education). Many Congolese people had assumed that independence would produce tangible and immediate social change, so the retention of whites in positions of importance was widely resented. Lieutenant-General √âmile Janssens, the Belgian commander of the Force Publique, refused to see Congolese independence as marking a change in the nature of command. The day after the independence festivities, he gathered the black non-commissioned officers of his L√©opoldville garrison and told them that things under his command would stay the same, summarising the point by writing \\"Before Independence = After Independence\\" on a blackboard. This message was hugely unpopular among the rank and file‚Äîmany of the men had expected rapid promotions and increases in pay to accompany independence. On 5 July 1960, several units mutinied against their white officers at Camp Hardy near Thysville. The insurrection spread to L√©opoldville the next day and later to garrisons across the country. Rather than deploying Belgian troops against the mutineers as Janssens had wished, Lumumba dismissed him and renamed the Force Publique the Arm√©e Nationale Congolaise (ANC). All black soldiers were promoted by at least one rank. Victor Lundula was promoted directly from sergeant-major to major-general and head of the army, replacing Janssens. At the same time, Joseph-D√©sir√© Mobutu, an ex-sergeant-major and close personal aide of Lumumba, became Lundula's deputy as army chief of staff. The government attempted to stop the revolt‚ÄîLumumba and Kasa-Vubu intervened personally at L√©opoldville and Thysville and persuaded the mutineers to lay down their arms‚Äîbut in most of the country the mutiny intensified. White officers and civilians were attacked, white-owned properties were looted and white women were raped. The Belgian government became deeply concerned by the situation, particularly when white civilians began entering neighbouring countries as refugees. The international press expressed shock at the apparent sudden collapse of order in the Congo, as the world view of the Congolese situation prior to independence‚Äîdue largely to Belgian propaganda‚Äîwas one of peace, stability, and strong control by the authorities. Force Publique soldiers in L√©opoldville in 1960 Lumumba's stance appeared to many Belgians to justify their prior concerns about his radicalism. On 9 July, Belgium deployed paratroopers, without the Congolese state's permission, in Kabalo and elsewhere to protect fleeing white civilians. The Belgian intervention divided Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu; while Kasa-Vubu accepted the Belgian operation, Lumumba denounced it and called for \\"all Congolese to defend our republic against those who menace it.\\" At Lumumba's request, white civilians from the port city of Matadi were evacuated by the Belgian Navy on 11 July. Belgian ships then bombarded the city; at least 19 civilians were killed. This action prompted renewed attacks on whites across the country, while Belgian forces entered other towns and cities, including L√©opoldville, and clashed with Congolese troops. The Belgian government subsequently announced that it would provide for Belgian bureaucrats back in the metropole, triggering an exodus of most of the Congo's 10,000 European civil servants and leaving the administration in disarray. Engulfed by the disorder spreading throughout the country, most of the government ministries were unable to function. =Katanga and South Kasai secessions= Flag of the secessionist State of Katanga, declared in 1960 On 11 July 1960, Mo√Øse Tshombe, the leader of CONAKAT, declared the Congo's southern province of Katanga independent as the State of Katanga, with √âlisabethville as its capital and himself as president. The mineral-rich Katanga region had traditionally shared closer economic ties with the Copperbelt of neighbouring Northern Rhodesia (then part of the Central African Federation) than with the rest of the Congo, and because of its economic importance it had been administered separately from the rest of the country under the Belgians. CONAKAT furthermore contended that Katangese people were ethnically distinct from other Congolese. The secession was partly motivated by the Katangese separatists' desire to keep more of the wealth generated by the province's mining operations and to avoid sharing it with the rest of the Congo. Another major factor was what CONAKAT held to be the disintegration of law and order in the central and north-eastern Congo. Announcing Katanga's breakaway, Tshombe said \\"We are seceding from chaos.\\" The President of secessionist Katanga, Mo√Øse Tshombe The major mining company in Katanga, the (UMHK), had begun supporting CONAKAT during the latter days of Belgian rule amid worries that the MNC might seek to nationalise the company's assets after independence. UMHK was largely owned by the , a prominent holding company based in Brussels that had close ties to the Belgian government. Encouraged by the UMHK, the Belgian government provided military support to Katanga and ordered its civil servants in the region to remain in their posts. Tshombe also recruited mercenaries, mainly whites from South Africa and the Rhodesias, to supplement and command Katangese troops. Although supported by the Belgians, Katanga never received formal diplomatic recognition from any country. The Katangese secession highlighted the \\"fundamental weakness\\" of the central government in L√©opoldville, which had been the chief advocate of a unified state. Less than a month after the Katangese secession, on 8 August, a section of the region of Kasai situated slightly to the north of Katanga also declared its autonomy from the central government as the Mining State of South Kasai () based around the city of Bakwanga. South Kasai was much smaller than Katanga, but was also a mining region. It was largely populated by the Luba ethnic group, and its president, Albert Kalonji, claimed that the secession was largely sparked by persecution of the Baluba in the rest of the Congo. The South Kasai government was supported by , another Belgian mining company, which received concessions from the new state in return for financial support. Without control over Katanga and South Kasai, the central government was deprived of approximately 40 percent of its revenues. =Foreign reaction and UN intervention= Disquiet about Belgium's support for the secessionist states led to calls within the United Nations (UN) to remove all Belgian troops from the country. The Secretary General of the UN, Dag Hammarskj√∂ld, believed that the crisis would provide the organisation with a chance to demonstrate its potential as a major peacekeeping force and encouraged the sending of a multinational contingent of peacekeepers to the Congo under UN command. On 14 July, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 143, calling for total Belgian withdrawal from the Congo and their replacement with a UN- commanded force. UN deployed troops from a variety of nations during ONUC. The arrival of the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC) was initially welcomed by Lumumba and the central government who believed the UN would help suppress the secessionist states. ONUC's initial mandate, however, only covered the maintenance of law and order. Viewing the secessions as an internal political matter, Hammarskj√∂ld refused to use UN troops to assist the central Congolese government against them; he argued that doing so would represent a loss of impartiality and breach Congolese sovereignty. Lumumba also sought the assistance of the United States government of Dwight D. Eisenhower, which refused to provide unilateral military support. Frustrated, he turned to the Soviet Union, which agreed to provide weapons, logistical and material support. Around 1,000 Soviet military advisors soon landed in the Congo. Lumumba's actions distanced him from the rest of the government, especially Kasa-Vubu, who feared the implications of Soviet intervention. The Americans also feared that a Soviet-aligned Congo could form the basis of a major expansion of communism into central Africa. With Soviet support, 2,000 ANC troops launched a major offensive against South Kasai. The attack was extremely successful, but during the course of the offensive, the ANC became involved in infighting between the Baluba and Bena Lulua ethnic groups. and perpetrated a number of large massacres of Luba civilians. Around 3,000 were killed. The violence of the advance caused an exodus of thousands of Baluba civilians who fled their homes to escape the fighting. The involvement of the Soviet Union alarmed the United States. The American government under Eisenhower, in line with Belgian criticism, had long believed that Lumumba was a communist and that the Congo could be on track to become a strategically placed Soviet client state. In August 1960, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agents in the region reported to their agency that \\"Congo [is] experiencing [a] classic communist ... takeover\\" and warned that the Congo might follow the same path as Cuba. Political disintegration =Central government split and first Mobutu coup= left Lumumba's appeal for Soviet support split the government and led to mounting pressure from Western countries to remove him from power. In addition, both Tshombe and Kalonji appealed to Kasa-Vubu, who they believed to be both a moderate and federalist, to move against Lumumba's centralism and resolve the secession issue. Meanwhile, Mobutu took effective control of the army, routing foreign aid and promotions to specific units and officers to secure their allegiance. On 5 September 1960, Kasa-Vubu announced on national radio that he had unilaterally dismissed Lumumba, using the massacres in South Kasai as a pretext and with the promise of American backing. Andrew Cordier, the American UN representative in the Congo, used his position to block communications by Lumumba's faction and to prevent a coordinated MNC-L reaction to the news. Both chambers of Parliament, however, supported Lumumba and denounced Kasa-Vubu's action. Lumumba attempted to dismiss Kasa-Vubu from his position, but could not get support for this, precipitating a constitutional crisis. Ostensibly in order to resolve the deadlock, Joseph-D√©sir√© Mobutu launched a bloodless coup and replaced both Kasa-Vubu and Lumumba with a College of Commissionaires-General (Coll√®ge des Commissaires-g√©n√©raux) consisting of a panel of university graduates, led by Justin Bomboko. Soviet military advisors were ordered to leave. Allegedly, the coup was intended to force the politicians to take a cooling-off period before they could resume control. In practice, however, Mobutu sided with Kasa-Vubu against Lumumba, who was placed under house arrest, guarded by Ghanaian UN troops and an outer ring of ANC soldiers. Kasa-Vubu was re-appointed President by Mobutu in February 1961. From the coup onwards, Mobutu was able to exert considerable power in Congolese politics behind the scenes. Colonel Mobutu (left) pictured alongside President Kasa-Vubu in 1961 Following Kasa-Vubu's reinstatement, there was an attempted rapprochement between the Congolese factions. Tshombe began negotiations for the end of the secession and the formation of a confederal Congo. Although a compromise agreement was reached, it was prevented from taking effect as negotiations broke down amid personal animosity between Kasa-Vubu and Tshombe. An attempted reconciliation in July 1961 led to the formation of a new government, led by Cyrille Adoula, which brought together deputies from both Lumumbist and South Kasai factions but failed to bring a reconciliation with Katanga. Members of the MNC-L fled to Stanleyville where, led by Antoine Gizenga, they formed a rebel government in November 1960 in opposition to the central government in L√©opoldville. The Gizenga government was recognised by some states, including the Soviet Union and China, as the official government of the Congo and could call on an approximate 5,500 troops compared to the central government's 7,000. Faced with UN pressure, the Gizenga government however collapsed in January 1962 after Gizenga was arrested. =Killing of Lumumba= Pro-Lumumba demonstrators in left Lumumba escaped house arrest and fled eastwards towards Stanleyville where he believed he could rally support. Pursued by troops loyal to Mobutu, he was captured at Lodi on 1 December 1960 and flown back to L√©opoldville with his hands bound. Despite UN appeals to Kasa-Vubu for due legal process, the Soviet Union denounced the UN as responsible for the arrest and demanded his release. A meeting of the UN Security Council was called on 7 December 1960 to consider Soviet demands that the UN seek Lumumba's immediate release, his restoration to the head of the Congolese government and the disarming of Mobutu's forces. The pro-Lumumba resolution was defeated on 14 December 1960 by a vote of 8‚Äì2. Still in captivity, Lumumba was tortured and transported to Thysville and later to Katanga, where he was handed over to forces loyal to Tshombe. On 17 January 1961, Lumumba was executed by Katangese troops near √âlisabethville. News of the execution, released on 13 February, provoked international outrage. The Belgian Embassy in Yugoslavia was attacked by protesters in Belgrade, and violent demonstrations occurred in London and New York. Shortly thereafter seven Lumumbists, including the first President of Orientale Province, Jean-Pierre Finant, were executed in South Kasai for \\"crimes against the Baluba nation\\". Gizenga's soldiers then shot 15 political prisoners in retaliation, including Lumumba's dissident Minister of Communications, Alphonse Songolo. =United Nations escalation and the end of the Katangese secession= Since its initial resolution of July 1960, the UN had issued further resolutions calling for the total withdrawal of Belgian and mercenary forces from Katanga in progressively stronger terms. By 1961, ONUC comprised nearly 20,000 men. Although their mandate prevented them from taking sides, ONUC had a mandate to arrest foreign mercenaries wherever they encountered them. In September 1961, an attempt to detain a group of Katangese mercenaries without violence during Operation Morthor went wrong and turned into a fire-fight. ONUC's claim to impartiality was undermined in mid- September when a company of Irish UN troops were captured by numerically superior Katangese forces following a six-day siege in Jadotville. Katanga proceeded to hold the Irishmen as prisoners of war, a development that deeply embarrassed the UN mission and its proponents. Swedish ONUC troops advancing upon the town of Kamina On 18 September 1961, Hammarskj√∂ld flew to Ndola, just across the border in Northern Rhodesia, to attempt to broker a cease-fire between UN and Katangese forces. His aircraft crashed before landing at Ndola Airport, killing him and everybody else on board. In stark contrast to Hammarskj√∂ld's attempts to pursue a moderate policy in the Congo, his successor U Thant supported a more radical policy of direct involvement in the conflict. Katanga released the captured Irish soldiers in mid-October as part of a cease-fire deal in which ONUC agreed to pull its troops back‚Äîa propaganda coup for Tshombe. Restated American support for the UN mission, and the murder of ten Italian UN pilots in Port-√âmpain in November 1961, strengthened international demands to resolve the situation. In April 1962, UN troops occupied South Kasai. On the night of 29/30 September 1962, South Kasai military commanders launched a coup d'√©tat in Bakwanga against the Kalonjist regime. On 5 October 1962, central government troops again arrived in Bakwanga to support the mutineers and help suppress the last Kalonjist loyalists, marking the end of South Kasai's secession. Map of the factions in the Congo in 1961 Resolution 169, issued in November 1961, called for ONUC to respond to the deteriorating human rights situation and prevent the outbreak of full- scale civil war. The resolution \\"completely rejected\\" Katanga's claim to statehood and authorised ONUC troops to use all necessary force to \\"assist the Central Government of the Congo in the restoration and maintenance of law and order\\". The Katangese made further provocations and, in response, ONUC launched Operation Unokat to dismantle Katangese roadblocks and seize strategic positions around √âlisabethville. Faced with international pressure, Tshombe signed the Kitona Declaration in December 1962 in which he agreed in principle to accept the authority of the central government and state constitution and to abandon any claim to Katangese independence. Following the declaration, however, talks between Tshombe and Adoula reached a deadlock, while Katangese forces continued to harass UN troops. Diminishing support and Belgium's increasing reluctance to support Katanga demonstrated that the state could not survive indefinitely. On 11 December 1962, Belgian Foreign Minister Paul-Henri Spaak declared that the Belgian government would support the UN or the central Congolese government should they attempt to end the Katangese secession through force. On 24 December 1962, UN troops and the Katangese Gendarmerie clashed near √âlisabethville and fighting broke out. After attempts to reach a ceasefire failed, UN troops launched Operation Grandslam and occupied √âlisabethville, prompting Tshombe to leave the country. A ceasefire was agreed upon soon thereafter. Indian UN troops, exceeding their orders, then occupied Jadotville, preventing Katangese loyalists from regrouping. Gradually, the UN overran the rest of the Katanga and, on 17 January 1963, Tshombe surrendered his final stronghold of Kolwezi, effectively ending the Katangese secession. =Attempted political reconciliation= A 1963 postage stamp commemorating the \\"reconciliation\\" of the political factions in the Congo after the end of the Katangese secession Following the end of the Katanga secession, political negotiations began to reconcile the disparate political factions. The negotiations coincided with the formation of an √©migr√© political group, the Conseil National de Lib√©ration (CNL), by dissident Lumumbists and others in neighbouring Congo-Brazzaville. The negotiations culminated in the creation of a new, revised constitution, known as the Luluabourg Constitution, after the city in which it was written, to create a compromise balance of power. The new constitution increased the power of the presidency, ending the system of joint consultation between President and Prime Minister, and appeased federalists by increasing the number of provinces from six to 21 while increasing their autonomy. The constitution also changed the name of the state from the Republic of the Congo to Democratic Republic of the Congo. It was ratified in a constitutional referendum in June 1964 and Parliament was dissolved to await new elections. Kasa-Vubu appointed Tshombe, the exiled Katangese leader, as interim Prime Minister. Although personally capable, and supported as an anti-communist by Western powers, Tshombe was denounced by other African leaders such as King Hassan II of Morocco as an imperialist puppet for his role in the Katangese secession. Under Tshombe's interim government, fresh elections were scheduled for 30 March and the rebellion broke out in the central and eastern parts of the Congo. Kwilu and Simba rebellions The period of political crisis had led to widespread disenchantment with the central government brought in by independence. Demands for a \\"second independence\\" from kleptocracy and political infighting in the capital grew. The \\"second independence\\" slogan was taken up by Maoist-inspired Congolese revolutionaries, including Pierre Mulele who had served in the Lumumba government. The political instability of the Congo helped to channel wider discontentment into outright revolt. Map showing the territory controlled by the Simba (red) and Kwilu (yellow) rebels, 1964 Disruption in the rural Congo begun with agitation by Lumumbists, led by Mulele, among the Pende and Mbundu peoples. By the end of 1963, there was unrest in regions of the central and eastern Congo. The Kwilu Rebellion broke out on 16 January 1964 in the cities of Idiofa and Gungu in Kwilu Province. Further disruption and uprisings then spread to Kivu in the east and later to Albertville, sparking further insurrection elsewhere in the Congo and the outbreak of the larger Simba Rebellion. The rebels began to expand their territory and rapidly advance northwards, capturing Port-√âmpain, Stanleyville, Paulis and Lisala between July and August. The rebels, who called themselves \\"Simbas\\" (from the Kiswahili word for \\"lion\\"), had a populist but vague ideology, loosely based on communism, which prioritised equality and aimed to increase overall wealth. Most of the active revolutionaries were young men who hoped that the rebellion would provide them with opportunities which the government had not. The Simbas used magic to initiate members and believed that, by following a moral code, they could become invulnerable to bullets. Magic was also very important to the rebels who also made extensive use of witchcraft to protect themselves and also demoralise their ANC opponents. As they advanced, the rebels perpetrated numerous massacres in the territory they captured in order to remove political opposition and terrorise the population. ONUC was in the process of withdrawing when the rebellions started and had only 5,500 personnel, most whom were deployed in the eastern part of the country and stranded by the conflict. Straggling Western missionaries retreated to their respective embassies, which in turn requested UN assistance. A small force of peacekeepers was assembled and subsequently dispatched to the Kwilu region to retrieve fleeing missionaries. Rescue operations continued throughout March and April and resulted in the successful recovery of over 100 missionaries. The rebels founded a state, the People's Republic of the Congo (R√©publique populaire du Congo), with its capital at Stanleyville and Christophe Gbenye as president. The new state was supported by the Soviet Union and China, which supplied it with arms, as did various African states, notably Tanzania. It was also supported by Cuba, which sent a team of over 100 advisors led by Che Guevara to advise the Simbas on tactics and doctrine. The Simba rebellion coincided with a wide escalation of the Cold War amid the Gulf of Tonkin incident and it has been speculated that, had the rebellion not been rapidly defeated, a full-scale American military intervention could have occurred as in Vietnam. =Suppression and Belgian and American intervention= After its early string of successes, the Simba rebellion began to encounter local resistance as it encroached on areas outside of the MNC-L's old domain. The People's Republic also suffered from a lack of coherent social and economic policy, contributing to an inability to administer its own territory. From the end of August 1964 the rebels began to lose ground to the ANC. Albertville and Lisala were recaptured in late August and early September. Tshombe, backed by Mobutu, recalled many of his former mercenaries from the Katangese secession to oppose the Simba. Mercenaries, led by \\"Mad Mike\\" Hoare and mostly whites from central and southern Africa, were formed into a unit known as 5 Commando ANC. The unit served as the spearhead of the ANC, but were known for widespread unsanctioned killing, torture, looting and mass rapes in recaptured rebel areas. In a press interview, Hoare himself described his men as \\"appalling thugs\\". The mercenaries were also materially supported by the CIA. Stanleyville airfield shortly after the operation In November 1964, the Simbas rounded up the remaining white population of Stanleyville and its environs. The whites were held hostage in the Victoria Hotel in the city to use as bargaining tools with the ANC. In order to recover the hostages, Belgian parachute troops were flown to the Congo in American aircraft to intervene. On 24 November, as part of Operation Dragon Rouge, Belgian paratroopers landed in Stanleyville and quickly secured the hostages. In total, around 70 hostages and 1,000 Congolese civilians were killed but the vast majority were evacuated. The Belgian troops were only under orders to liberate the hostages, rather than push the Simbas out of the city, but the attack nevertheless \\"broke the back of the eastern insurrection, which never recovered.\\" The Simba leadership went into exile in disarray and severe disagreement; Gbenye was shot in the shoulder by his general after dismissing him. Meanwhile, the Belgian paratroopers and the civilians returned to their country. In the aftermath of the intervention, Belgium itself was publicly accused of neocolonialism. As a result of the intervention, Tshombe lost the support of Kasa-Vubu and Mobutu and was dismissed from his post as prime minister in October 1965. Soon after Dragon Rouge, ANC and mercenary troops captured Stanleyville, putting an end to the Simba rebellion. Pockets of Simba resistance continued to hold out in the eastern Congo, most notably in South Kivu, where Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila led a Maoist cross-border insurgency which lasted until the 1980s. Second Mobutu coup d'√©tat In the scheduled March 1965 elections, Tshombe's Convention Nationale Congolaise (CONACO) won a large majority of the seats, but a large part of his party soon defected to form the new Front D√©mocratique Congolais (FDC), making the overall result unclear as CONACO controlled the Chamber of Deputies while the FDC controlled the Senate. Kasa-Vubu, attempting to use the situation to block Tshombe, appointed an anti-Tshombe leader, √âvariste Kimba of the FDC, to be prime minister-designate in November 1965, but the largely pro-Tshombe Parliament refused to ratify the appointment. Instead of seeking a compromise candidate, Kasa-Vubu again unilaterally declared Kimba to be Prime Minister, which was again rejected, creating a political deadlock. With the government in near-paralysis, Mobutu seized power in a bloodless coup, ostensibly to stop the impasse, on 25 November 1965. Under the auspices of a r√©gime d'exception (the equivalent of a state of emergency), Mobutu assumed sweeping, almost absolute, power for five years, after which, he claimed, democracy would be restored. Mobutu's coup, which promised both economic and political stability, was supported by the United States and other Western governments, and his rule initially met widespread popularity. He increasingly took other powers, abolishing the post of Prime Minister in 1966 and dissolving Parliament in 1967. Aftermath and legacy Mobutu with Richard Nixon at the White House in 1973 Once established as the sole source of political power, Mobutu gradually consolidated his control in the Congo. The number of provinces was reduced, and their autonomy curtailed, resulting in a highly centralised state. Mobutu increasingly placed his supporters in the remaining positions of importance. In 1967, to demonstrate his legitimacy, he created a party, the Mouvement Populaire de la R√©volution (MPR), which until 1990, was the nation's only legal political party under Mobutu's new constitution. In 1971, the state was renamed Zaire and efforts were made to remove all colonial influences. He also nationalised the remaining foreign-owned economic assets in the country, including the UMHK which became G√©camines. Despite initial successes, by the time of its disestablishment Mobutu's rule was characterised by widespread cronyism, corruption and economic mismanagement. In the years after the Congo Crisis, Mobutu was able to remove many opposition figures from the crisis who might threaten his control. Tshombe was sent into a second exile in 1965 after being accused of treason. Between 1966 and 1967, two mutinies in Stanleyville broke out involving up to 800 Katangese gendarmes and former mercenaries of Tshombe. The mutinies were eventually repressed. In 1967, Tshombe was sentenced to death in absentia and the same year was kidnapped in an aeroplane hijacking and held under arrest in Algeria. His death in 1969, allegedly from natural causes, has provoked speculation that the Mobutu government may have been involved. Mulele was also lured back to the Congo from exile by the promise of an amnesty but was tortured and murdered. =Political legacy= The issues of federalism, ethnicity in politics and state centralisation were not resolved by the crisis and partly contributed to a decline in support for the concept of the state among Congolese people. Mobutu was strongly in favour of centralisation and one of his first acts, in 1965, were to reunify provinces and abolish much of their independent legislative capacity. Subsequent loss of faith in central government is one of the reasons that the Congo has been labeled as a failed state, and has contributed violence by factions advocating ethnic and localised federalism. Local insurgencies continued in the eastern Congo into the 1980s and left a legacy of instability along the Congo's eastern borders. Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila, who had led an anti-Mobutu insurrection during the crisis, succeeded in deposing Mobutu in 1997 and becoming president of the restored Democratic Republic of the Congo. He was succeeded by his son, Joseph Kabila. Following the fall of Mobutu, Antoine Gizenga founded a political party, the Parti Lumumbiste Unifi√© (PALU), and was appointed Prime Minister following the 2006 general election. The Congo Crisis holds great significance in the collective memory of the Congolese people. In particular, Lumumba's murder is viewed in the context of the memory as a symbolic moment in which the Congo lost its dignity in the international realm and the ability to determine its future, which has since been controlled by the West. Many Congolese view the problems of the crisis as unresolved, and believe that the Congo's self-determination has yet to be secured from Western machinations. The latter notion has largely shaped the political aspirations of a substantial number of Congolese. =Historiography and historical controversy= The Congo Crisis is usually portrayed in historiography as a time of intense disorder and disarray; there is wide consensus that Congolese independence was a calamity. This interpretation often juxtaposes the crisis with the supposed stability of the Congo under Belgian rule before 1960 and under Mobutu's regime after 1965. In Belgium, allegations of Belgian complicity in the killing of Lumumba led to a state-backed inquiry and subsequent official apology in 2001 for \\"moral responsibility\\", though not direct involvement, in the assassination. Most academics have concluded that the United States intervened significantly in the crisis. The multi-volume official history of the American foreign service, Foreign Relations of the United States, was accused by academic David N. Gibbs of deliberately diminishing American involvement. International importance The turmoil of the Congo Crisis destabilised Central Africa and helped to ignite the Portuguese Colonial War, especially the war of independence in neighbouring Angola. Angolan nationalists had long had close ties with the Congo where many had lived as exiles. The Uni√£o dos Povos de Angola (UPA), an Angolan nationalist organisation which drew support from the Angolan Bakongo, was supporting ABAKO politicians who had hopes of rebuilding the Kingdom of Kongo, altering the borders established during the colonial period. Believing that the independence of Congo was the first stage in this process, the UPA launched the Baixa de Cassanje revolt in 1961, igniting the conflict in Angola that would last until 1974. The Congolese, later Zairian, governments continued to provide support to Angolan rebels and even participated directly in the subsequent Angolan Civil War. The crisis caused the newly independent African states to reconsider their allegiances and internal ties. In particular, it led to the division of African states into factions. Moderate- leaning states joined the Brazzaville Group, which called for a degree of unity between Francophone African states and the maintenance of ties with France. Radical states joined the Casablanca Group which called for a Pan- African federation. The chaotic violence of the crisis and the fate of the country's whites, many of whom entered Northern and Southern Rhodesia as refugees, contributed to the widespread belief among whites there that black nationalist politicians were not ready to govern, and prompted fears that immediate majority rule in Rhodesia might lead to a similar situation. After negotiations with Britain repeatedly broke down, Southern Rhodesia's predominantly white government declared independence unilaterally in 1965. The Katangese secession would prove to be politically influential in Africa. During the Chadian Civil War between 1965 and 1979, the Front de Lib√©ration Nationale du Tchad (FROLINAT) explicitly rejected secessionism in its bid to remove the southern-backed government of Fran√ßois Tombalbaye following the experience of the Katanga secession, officially stating that \\"there will be no Katanga in Chad\\". In the Nigerian Civil War, between 1967 and 1970, the ethnically Igbo region of Biafra seceded from Nigeria, which it accused of privileging the interests of northern ethnic groups and discriminating against the Igbo. The secessions of Biafra and Katanga have frequently been compared in academic writing. Unlike Katanga, Biafra achieved limited official international recognition and rejected the support of Western multinational companies involved in the local oil industry. Biafra was defeated in 1970 and re-integrated into Nigeria.

He also served as the Nazi party Gauleiter in Hanover and Brunswick from 1925-1940. Early life Rust was born in Hanover, and obtained a doctorate in German philology and philosophy. After passing the state teaching examination with the grade \\"gut\\" (i.e. good)Hitlers Bildungsreformer: Das Reichsministerium f√ºr Wissenschaft, Erziehung und Volksbildung 1934-1945, by Anne C. Nagel, Fischer publishing house, 2012, in 1908, he became a high school teacher at Hanover's Ratsgymnasium, then served in the army during World War I. He reached the rank of Oberleutnant, served as a company commander and was awarded the Iron Cross first and second class for bravery. He was wounded in action, sustaining a severe head injury that caused serious mental and physical impairments for the rest of his life. He was discharged in December 1918 and returned to Hanover.Michael D. Miller & Andreas Schulz: Gauleiter: The Regional Leaders of the Nazi Party and Their Deputies, 1925-1945, Volume II (Georg Joel - Dr. Bernhard Rust), R. James Bender Publishing, 2017, p. 415, . Political career Rust joined the NSDAP in 1921 and was a cofounder of the Ortsgruppe (Local Group) in Hanover. When the Nazi Party was banned in the aftermath of the Beer Hall Putsch, Rust joined the German V√∂lkisch Freedom Party and served as an Ortsgruppenfuhrer and later as Gauleiter for Hanover. When the ban on the Nazi Party was lifted, he rejoined it (membership number 3,390).Michael D. Miller & Andreas Schulz: Gauleiter: The Regional Leaders of the Nazi Party and Their Deputies, 1925-1945, Volume II (Georg Joel - Dr. Bernhard Rust), R. James Bender Publishing, 2017, pp. 415-416, . On 22 March 1925 he was named Gauleiter for the Gau of North Hanover. When the Gaue were reorganized on 1 October 1928, he became the Gauleiter for Southern Hanover‚ÄìBrunswick. He retained this position until November 1940 when he was succeeded by Hartmann Lauterbacher.Karl H√∂ffkes: Hitlers politische Generale. Die Gauleiter des Dritten Reiches. Ein biographisches Nachschlagewerk, Grabert-Verlag, T√ºbingen, 1986, p. 278, . In September 1930, he was elected to the Reichstag from electoral constituency 16, Southern Hanover-Brunswick. He would remain a Reichstag deputy through the end of the Nazi regime in 1945. On 15 July 1932 came his appointment as Landesinspekteur for Lower Saxony. In this position, he had oversight responsibility for his Gau and four others (Eastern-Hanover, North Westphalia, South Westphalia & Weser-Ems). This was a short-lived initiative by Gregor Strasser to centralize control over the Gaue. However, it was unpopular with the Gauleiters and was repealed on Strasser's fall from power in December 1932. Rust then returned to his Gauleiter position in Southern Hanover- Brunswick.Dietrich Orlow: The History of the Nazi Party: 1919-1933 (University of Pittsburgh Press), 1969, pp. 273-295 . Shortly after Hitler became Chancellor in 1933, Rust was appointed as the Prussian Minister for Cultural Affairs. On 1 May 1934, he was selected as Reichsminister of Science, Education and National Culture (Wissenschaft, Erziehung und Volksbildung) and set about to reshape the German educational system to conform to his ideals of National Socialism. Considered by many to be mentally unstable, Rust would capriciously create new regulations and then repeal them just as quickly. One noted example was in 1935, when he changed the traditional six-day school week to five days, with Saturday to be \\"Reich's Youth Day\\" when children in the Hitler Youth and the League of German Girls would be out of school for study and testing. He then ordered the creation of a \\"rolling week\\", with six days for study, followed by the \\"youth day\\" and a rest day, in 8-day periods. Thus, a rolling week starting on Monday would end with rest on the following Monday; the next rolling week would start on Tuesday and end 8 days later on the next Tuesday. When the 8-day week proved unworkable, Rust went back to the former system.Current Biography 1942, pp725; \\"The Good Earth\\", TIMEmagazine, 30 September 1935 It was Rust who, in 1933, issued a rule that students and teachers should greet each other with the Nazi salute \\"as a symbol of the new Germany\\". He added his opinion that it was \\"expected of every German\\" regardless of membership in the party.\\"Sub-Dictator\\", TIMEmagazine, 21 August 1933 Rust was instrumental in purging German universities of Jews and others regarded as enemies of the State, most notably at the University of G√∂ttingen. Nazi Germany's future leaders received their instruction elsewhere, in an NPEA or \\"Napola\\" (NAtionalPOLitische erziehungsAnstalten), of which there were 30 in the nation, where they would receive training to become administrators of conquered provinces.\\"How Nazis are Trained\\", TIMEmagazine, 25 August 1941 He bluntly informed teachers that their aim was to educate ethnically aware Germans. Rust also believed that non-Aryan science (such as Albert Einstein's \\"Jewish physics\\") was flawed, and had what he felt to be a rational explanation for this view. In an address to scientists, he said, \\"The problems of science do not present themselves in the same way to all men. The Negro or the Jew will view the same world in a different light from the German investigator.\\"Current Biography 1942, p727 Erika Mann, the daughter of Thomas Mann, wrote an expos√© of the Rust system in 1938 entitled School for Barbarians, followed in 1941 by Gregor Ziemer's Education for Death. Death Rust reportedly committed suicide on 8 May 1945 when Germany surrendered to Allied forces. Spelling reform Rust prepared a reform of German orthography, and his fairly extensive version corresponded to the ideas of the spelling reformers of the 1970s (lowercase common nouns, elimination of lengthening symbols). This attempt met internal resistance of the Reich's ministry. The German orthography reform of 1944 also failed. Before these failures, the rules of the reform were printed in millions of copies intended for classroom use and published in numerous newspapers. The 1944 reform was postponed on the orders of Hitler because it was \\"not important for the war effort.\\" Some of Rust's innovations had, however, found their way into the 1942 Duden, such as the spelling of the word Kautsch for Couch, which persisted into the 1980s. Many of the proposed changes were finally implemented with the German orthography reform of 1996.

This position has designated the players at each end of the defensive line, but changes in formations over the years have substantially changed how the position is played. History Early formations, with six- and seven-man lines, used the end as a containment player, whose job was first to prevent an \\"end run\\" around his position, then secondarily to force plays inside. When most teams adopted a five-man line, two different styles of end play developed: \\"crashing\\" ends, who rushed into the backfield to disrupt plays, and \\"stand- up\\" or \\"waiting\\" ends, who played the more traditional containment style. Some teams would use both styles of end play, depending on game situations. Traditionally, defensive ends are in a three-point stance, with their free hand cocked back ready to \\"punch\\" an offensive lineman, or in a two-point stance like a strong safety so they can keep containment. Some defensive ends play the position due to their size; they close down their gap so the running back has no hole to run through. Other ends play the position due to their speed and agility; they are used to rush the quarterback. These ends can time the snap of the ball in order to get a jump on the rush, and stop the play. Everson Griffen rushing Jay Cutler Most of the time it is the job of the defensive end in run defense to keep outside or containment, which means that no one should get to their outside; they must keep everything to the inside. If they have an outside linebacker besides them that is not in pass coverage, this gives the defensive end more freedom to rush the quarterback. The defensive ends are fast for players of their size, often the fastest and smallest players on the defensive line. They must be able to shed blockers to get to the ball. Defensive ends are also often used to cover the outside area of the line of scrimmage, to tackle ball carriers running to the far right or left side, and to defend against screen passes. Since the creation of zone blitz defenses in the late 1990s, defensive ends have sometimes been used in pass coverage, dropping back to cover routes run close to the line of scrimmage. In the 3‚Äì4 defense, defensive ends are used primarily as run stoppers and are much larger than the normal size of a player at this position. Often, the position is played by a more agile or slightly undersized defensive tackle. Because of the increased popularity of the 3‚Äì4 defense, the value of a defensive tackle prospect that can possibly be used in this manner has increased. They are used to distract an offensive lineman on pass rushing plays to let the outside linebackers get a sack. They block screen passes and are put outside the offensive tackles to get a sack. Defensive ends in the 3‚Äì4 defense average a height of 6‚Ä≤3‚Ä≥‚Äì6‚Ä≤8‚Ä≥ and a weight of 285‚Äì315 lbs.

The book was awarded the Mathematical Association of America's inaugural Euler Book Prize in 2007. Overview The book is written such that even-numbered chapters present historical elements related to the development of the conjecture, and odd-numbered chapters deal with the mathematical and technical aspects. Despite the title, the book provides biographical information on many iconic mathematicians including Euler, Gauss, and Lagrange. In chapter 1, \\"Card Trick\\", Derbyshire introduces the idea of an infinite series and the ideas of convergence and divergence of these series. He imagines that there is a deck of cards stacked neatly together, and that one pulls off the top card so that it overhangs from the deck. Explaining that it can overhang only as far as the center of gravity allows, the card is pulled so that exactly half of it is overhanging. Then, without moving the top card, he slides the second card so that it is overhanging too at equilibrium. As he does this more and more, the fractional amount of overhanging cards as they accumulate becomes less and less. He explores various types of series such as the harmonic series. In chapter 2, Bernhard Riemann is introduced and a brief historical account of Eastern Europe in the 18th Century is discussed. In chapter 3, the Prime Number Theorem (PNT) is introduced. The function which mathematicians use to describe the number of primes in N numbers, œÄ(N), is shown to behave in a logarithmic manner, as so: : \\\\pi(N) \\\\approx \\\\frac{N}{\\\\log(N)} where log is the natural logarithm. In chapter 5, the Riemann Zeta Function is introduced: : \\\\zeta(s) = 1 + \\\\frac{1}{2^s} + \\\\frac{1}{3^s} + \\\\frac{1}{4^s} + \\\\cdots = \\\\sum_{n = 1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{n^s} In chapter 4, Derbyshire gives a short biographical history of Carl Friedrich Gauss and Leonard Euler, setting up their involvement in the Prime Number Theorem. In chapter 7, the sieve of Eratosthenes is shown to be able to be simulated using the Zeta function. With this, the following statement which becomes the pillar stone of the book is asserted: : \\\\zeta(s) = \\\\prod_{p\\\\ \\\\mathrm{prime}} \\\\frac{1}{1 - {p^{-s}}} Following the derivation of this finding, the book delves into how this is manipulated to expose the PNT's nature. Audience and reception According to reviewer S. W. Graham, the book is written at a level that is suitable for advanced undergraduate students of mathematics. In contrast, James V. Rauff recommends it to \\"anyone interested in the history and mathematics of the Riemann hypothesis\\". Reviewer Don Redmond writes that, while the even-numbered chapters explain the history well, the odd-numbered chapters present the mathematics too informally to be useful, failing to provide insight to readers who do not already understand the mathematics, and failing even to explain the importance of the Riemann hypothesis. Graham adds that the level of mathematics is inconsistent, with detailed explanations of basics and sketchier explanations of material that is more advanced. But for those who do already understand the mathematics, he calls the book \\"a familiar story entertainingly told\\".

Currently operating as the Palmer House - A Hilton Hotel, it is a Historic Hotels of America member, Historic Hotels of America the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The Palmer House was the city's first hotel with elevators and the first hotel with electric light bulbs and telephones in the guest rooms. It has also been dubbed the longest continuously operating hotel in North America. History Palmer House Hotel Ladies Entrance (19 September 1903) Three Palmer House hotels have been located at the corner of State and Monroe streets in Chicago. =First Palmer House= Stereoscopic view of the first Palmer House The first (known as \\"The Palmer\\") was built as a wedding present from Potter Palmer to his bride Bertha Honor√©. It opened on September 26, 1871, but burned down just 13 days later on October 9, 1871 in the Great Chicago Fire. Palmer immediately set to work rebuilding, and with a $1.7 million signature loan (believed to be the largest individual loan ever secured at that time), constructed one of the fanciest hotels worldwide in postfire Chicago. Stereoscopic view of the ruins of the first Palmer House after the Great Chicago Fire =Second Palmer House= Stereoscopic view of the second Palmer House Designed by architect John M. Van Osdel, the second Palmer House Hotel was seven stories. Its amenities included oversized rooms, luxurious decor, and sumptuous meals served in grand style. The floor of its barber shop was tiled and silver dollars were embedded in a diamond pattern. Constructed mainly of iron and brick, the hotel was widely advertised as, \\"The World's Only Fire Proof Hotel.\\" Famous visitors included presidential hopefuls James Garfield, Grover Cleveland, Ulysses S. Grant, William Jennings Bryan, and William McKinley; writers Mark Twain, L. Frank Baum, and Oscar Wilde; actresses Sarah Bernhardt and Eleonora Duse, and French cabaret singer Yvette Guilbert in 1897. It was completed in 1875. An 1895 meeting at the hotel of faculty representatives from various Midwestern universities resulted in the founding of the Big Ten Conference. =Third Palmer House= Palmer House Lobby By the 1920s, the business in downtown Chicago could support a much larger facility, and the Palmer Estate decided to erect a new 25-story hotel. They hired Holabird & Roche to design the building, and their team included architect Richard Neutra in a junior role. Between 1923 and 1925, the hotel was rebuilt on the same site.Berger, Molly W. \\"Hotels\\" at the Encyclopedia of Chicago In December 1945, Conrad Hilton bought the Palmer House for $20 million and it was thereafter known as The Palmer House Hilton. In 2005, Hilton sold the property to Thor Equities, but it remains part of the Hilton chain. The architecture firms of Loebl Schlossman & Hackl and David Fleener Architects completely renovated and restored the hotel between 2007 and 2009. The total cost was over $170 million. The hotel has a total of 1,639 guest rooms, making it the second-largest hotel in the city after the Hyatt Regency Chicago. It has recently had its name adjusted to Palmer House - A Hilton Hotel. In 1970, the hotel was the site of the murder of Evelyn Okubo, a young Japanese-American racial justice activist attending a Japanese American Citizens League convention held there. Entertainers who have appeared at the Palmer House's Empire Room have included Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Liberace, Ella Fitzgerald, Maurice Chevalier, Lena Horne, Nat King Cole, Louis Armstrong, Harry Belafonte, Sammy Davis Jr., Peggy Lee, Carol Channing, Bobby Darin, Jimmy Durante, Sonny & Cher, Liza Minnelli, Dionne Warwick, Sophie Tucker, Tommy Dorsey, Phyllis Diller, Lou Rawls, Frankie Laine (1963), Josh White (1966), Tony Bennett (1968), Florence Henderson (1968), Donald O'Connor (1971), Jerry Lewis (1971), Jane Powell (1972), The Supremes (1972), Lorna Luft (1972), Trini Lopez (1973), The Lettermen (1973) and many others.

(1930) Orobanchaceae. In Engler, A. (ed.) Das Pflanzenreich 4: 1-348. (Engelmann:Leipzig). Some species formerly included in this genus are now referred to the genus Conopholis. The broomrape plant is small, from 10‚Äì60 cm tall depending on species. It is best recognized by its yellow- to straw-coloured stems completely lacking chlorophyll, bearing yellow, white, or blue snapdragon-like flowers. The flower shoots are scaly, with a dense terminal spike of between ten and twenty flowers in most species, although single in O. uniflora. The leaves are merely triangular scales. The seeds are minute, tan-to-brown, and blacken with age. These plants generally flower from late winter to late spring. When they are not flowering, no part of the plants is visible above the surface of the soil. As they have no chlorophyll, they are totally dependent on other plants for nutrients. Broomrape seeds remain dormant in the soil, often for many years, until stimulated to germinate by certain compounds produced by living plant roots.Yoder, J.I. (2001) Host-plant recognition by parasitic Scrophulariaceae. Current Opinion in Plant Biology 4:359-365. Broomrape seedlings put out a root-like growth, which attaches to the roots of nearby hosts. Once attached to a host, the broomrape robs its host of water and nutrients. Some species are only able to parasitise a single plant species, such as ivy broomrape Orobanche hederae, which is restricted to parasitising ivy; these species are often named after the plant they parasitise. Others can infect several genera, such as the lesser broomrape O. minor, which lives on clover and other related Fabaceae. Branched broomrape (Orobanche ramosa), native to central and southwestern Europe but widely naturalised elsewhere, is considered a major threat to crops in some areas. Plants that it parasitizes are tomato, eggplant, potato, cabbage, coleus, bell pepper, sunflower, celery, and beans. In heavily infested areas, branched broomrape can cause total crop failure. The stems of Orobanche crenata, a species parasitic on the fava bean, are gathered and eaten in the region of Apulia, in southern Italy, where they are given the name of sporchia.Luard, E. European peasant cookery, Grub Street, 2004, p.380 Etymology The scientific name comes from Ancient Greek ·ΩÑœÅŒøŒ≤ŒøœÇ (orobos, ‚Äúbitter vetch‚Äù) + ·ºÑŒ≥œáœâ (ankh≈ç, ‚Äústrangle‚Äù). The common English name comes from the English word broom, and the Latin rapum (\\"tuber\\").

With headquarters in Moscow, it organizes Russian amateur and professional football, including the men's, women's, youth, beach football, futsal and Paralympic national teams. The RFS sanctions referees and football tournaments for Russian Football Premier League and most football leagues in Russia. RFU is currently headed by Aleksandr Dyukov, the CEO of Gazprom Neft. Structure The RFS is governed by a board of directors led by a chairman, Nikita Simonyan, and a director general, Aleksandr Alayev. The RFS is a member of international football bodies FIFA and UEFA, and also has a relationship with the International Olympic Committee (IOC). History =Russian Empire= The All-Russian Football Union (VFS) was created on 19 January 1912 and in the same year was admitted to FIFA. The Unions initially consisted of 52 organizations across the Russian Empire. All-Russian Football Union was the organizer of Russian Empire national football team which played 16 internationals between 1910 and 1914. = Soviet Union = In 1934, the Football Federation of USSR was formed initially under the name the Football Section of Soviet Union. The organization of it was in accordance with the Declaration of the All-Union Council of Fitness Culture of USSR on 27 December 1934. The Section was admitted to FIFA as the Soviet organization in 1946 and admitted to UEFA in 1954. Later the Section was reorganized as the Football Federation of USSR. Concurrently with the Section and later Federation until 1972 there operated the Football Directorate of the Soviet Sport Committee that was subordinated directly to the Soviet Ministry of Sport. The Directorate was never recognized on the international level. =Russian Federation= With the fall of the Soviet Union the modern Russian Football Union was formed (a constituent conference took place on 8 February 1992), inheriting everything from the previous associations such as VRS and Football Federation of USSR and reinstated in FIFA on 3 July 1992. In July 1992, the Russian national football team was formed.

Tillman served as the alderman of the city's 3rd Ward (map) from 1985 until 2007. A member of the Democratic Party, representing part of the city's South Side in the Chicago City Council. As an Alderman, Tillman was a strong advocate of reparations for slavery. In April 2007, Tillman was defeated in a runoff election by challenger Pat Dowell. Tillman defeated Dowell in 2003. Prior to her career as an alderman, Tillman was active in the Civil Rights Movement, working for Martin Luther King Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) as an activist. Tillman was known for wearing large hats and has cultivated this image as her trademark. Biography =Civil rights movement= Tillman was born as Dorothy Jean Wright in Montgomery, Alabama to James Wright, a local handyman and Edna Mae Struggs (formerly Wright; d. November 30, 2009).Austin Weekly - Dorothy Tillman's mother dies - December 9, 2009 Tillman's parents divorced when she was a child which resulted in her spending her childhood between Montgomery with her father and Pensacola, Florida, where her mother had remarried and relocated to.Chicao Tribune - The Hat Lady - November 12, 2006 Tillman joined the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) as a trainee and field staff organizer in 1963. Tillman marched with Martin Luther King Jr. and was among the SCLC Field Staff to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama in the Selma to Montgomery marches on 7 March 1965. Tillman had her first involvement in Chicago politics later in 1965 when King sent her there to campaign for better housing, education and employment conditions for blacks. This campaign marked the start of King's effort to improve socio-economic conditions for blacks. Tillman was involved in organizing King's move into a Chicago tenement in early 1966 and the launch of his campaign in July 1966. By 1967, Tillman and her husband, Jimmy, moved to San Francisco shortly after their marriage and became involved in a successful campaign to improve public transport services to their neighborhood. Tillman and her husband later returned to Chicago where she became involved in educational issues. Tillman founded the Parent Equalizers of Chicago, which eventually became active in 300 schools across the city, setting the groundwork for school reform in Chicago. The momentum created by several successful grassroots campaigns Tillman helped organize led to the election of Chicago‚Äôs first African American mayor, Harold Washington in 1983. =Chicago Alderman (1985‚Äì2007)= Dorothy Tillman was appointed by Mayor Harold Washington and later elected as an alderman representing the city's third ward in February 1985, being the first woman elected for that ward. Tillman pioneered the first TIF to be used in the black community, with the construction of the 55th and Dan Ryan shopping center. She helped to found the African American Home Builders Association and advocated for a 70/30 plan to make certain that African Americans received the majority of the contracts. Amid the Democratic primary of the 1989 Chicago mayoral special election, in which she was supporting Timothy C. Evans, Tillman called incumbent mayor Eugene Sawyer an \\"Uncle Tom\\". In July 1988, after months of attacks on him from Tillman, Evans himself, and other allies of Evans such as Bobby Rush, Sawyer retaliated by stripping them of their committee chairmanships in a City Council restructuring. In this, Tillman was removed as chairman of the Housing Committee. In 2000, Tillman requested that two waiters at the Palmer House hotel in Chicago be replaced with African-American waiters for a banquet hosted by Alderman Tillman. Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley delivered a strongly worded rebuke in the media.Spielman, Fran: \\"Daley blasts Tillman for waiter request\\", 20 July 2001, Chicago Sun-Times, Tillman was an advocate of reparations for slavery and was successful in having a number of resolutions passed in support of the concept. She authored a bill, passed unanimously in 2002, forcing companies who perform contracts with the council to declare any past ties with slavery. In early 2005, Tillman led a campaign against a $500 million refinancing deal with the Bank of America because of its alleged links with slavery. In the case of the Bank of America, these links are allegedly through FleetBoston Financial, a company which it acquired in 2004. Providene, a predecessor of Fleet Boston, was supposedly founded by a slave owner in 1791. During one loud session of the City Council, Tillman gained the attention of the entire floor when she produced a pistol from her handbag and brandished it about.Okpotor, Faith: \\"Pistol packin‚Äô aldermen protected by the law\\", http://www.chicagodefender.com/page/local.cfm?ArticleID=3863 , Chicago Defender, February 3, 2006 This led some aldermen and Chicago citizens to call for a censure on Tillman's professional ethics, and possible mandatory gun safety training. \\"Tillman has been involved in the Harold Washington Cultural Center (HWCC) since its inception. A 2006 three-part investigative report by the Chicago local paper Lakefront Outlook reported accounting irregularities and conflicts of interest by Tillman and her family.Lakefront Outlook: \\"Cultural center under scrutiny\\", http://www.hpherald.com/tillmanstory_12_13_27_07.pdf , Lakefront Outlook, December 13, 2006\\"Long Island University Announces Winners of 2006 George Polk Awards\\"; http://www.brooklyn.liu.edu/polk/press/2006.html, \\"Long Island University\\" Despite the controversy and his stand on ethics reform, U.S. Senator Barack Obama endorsed Tillman in her 2007 election noting she was an early supporter of his. Although she had the backing of Chicago's Mayor Richard Daley, Tillman was not able to achieve a majority of votes in Chicago's non-partisan aldermanic election in February 2007. As a result, Tillman stood in a runoff election against challenger Pat Dowell. Dowell took 54 percent of the vote to 46 percent for Tillman.\\"Union candidates surprise Daley-backed Tillman, Haithcock, Coleman,\\" April 18, 2007 Chicago Sun-Times, p. 23. During a heated debate between Tillman and Dowell on April 3, 2007, Dowell charged Tillman with failing to produce business growth beyond the street corner where her ward office was located and stated \\"I will be the change agent,\\" after which Tillman's daughter (and political staffer) shouted out \\"A white man agent!\\"Dumke, Mick: \\"Aldermania: The Final Round\\", http://www.chicagoreader.com/features/stories/aldermania/ , Chicago Reader, April 13, 2007 Personal Tillman has been married once and has five children. Tillman married Jimmy Lee Tillman, a musician circa 1967. Together they had five children including Jimmy Lee Tillman Jr. (b. 1968)Our Campaigns - Jimmy Lee Tillman II who ran for U.S. Congress in 2014,ABC 7 Chicago - Jimmy Lee Tillman, II, Candidate for U.S. Congress, 1st District - September 30, 2014 and Ebony Tillman who challenged third ward alderman Pat Dowell in 2011.Gazette Chicago - A new Tillman looks to defeat Dowell in heated 3rd Ward race - February 4, 2011 In October 2008 Tillman was convicted for criminal trespassing at an Alabama hospital in March 2008.

Standard documentation The following documentation categories for the private class data design pattern follows the design pattern documentation style precedent set by the Gang of Four. =Name and classification= ; Pattern Name : This pattern is known as the private class data design pattern. ; Pattern Classification : This pattern is a structural pattern. =Intent= The private class data design pattern seeks to reduce exposure of attributes by limiting their visibility. It reduces the number of class attributes by encapsulating them in single Data object. It allows the class designer to remove write privilege of attributes that are intended to be set only during construction, even from methods of the target class. =Also known as= PIMPL (Private IMPLementation) or Opaque pointer =Motivation= A class may expose its attributes (class variables) to manipulation when manipulation is no longer desirable, e.g. after construction. Using the private class data design pattern prevents that undesirable manipulation. A class may have one-time mutable attributes that cannot be declared final. Using this design pattern allows one-time setting of those class attributes. The motivation for this design pattern comes from the design goal of protecting class state by minimizing the visibility of its attributes (data). =Applicability= This design pattern applies to any class in many object oriented languages. =Structure= =Participants= =Collaboration= =Consequences= The consequences of using this design pattern include the following: * Controlling write access to class attributes; * Separating of data from methods that use it; * Encapsulating class attribute (data) initialization; and * Providing new type of final: final after constructor. =Implementation= The private class data design pattern solves the problems above by extracting a data class for the target class and giving the target class instance an instance of the extracted data class. * The data class exposes each attribute (variable or property) through a getter. * The data class exposes each attribute that must change after construction through a setter. =Sample code= The following C# code illustrates an opportunity to use the private class data design pattern: public class Circle { private double _radius; private Color _color; private Point _origin; public Circle(double radius, Color color, Point origin) { this._radius = radius; this._color = color; this._origin = origin; } public double Circumference => 2 * Math.PI * this._radius; public double Diameter => 2 * this._radius; public void Draw(Graphics graphics) { //... } } The attributes radius, color, and origin above should not change after the Circle() constructor. Note that the visibility is already limited by scoping them as private, but doing methods of class Circle can still modify them. The excess exposure of the attributes creates a type of (undesirable) coupling between methods that access those attributes. To reduce the visibility of the attributes and thus reduce the coupling, implement the private class data design pattern, as follows: public class CircleData { private double _radius; private Color _color; private Point _origin; public CircleData(double radius, Color color, Point origin) { this._radius = radius; this._color = color; this._origin = origin; } public double Radius => this._radius; public Color Color => this._color; public Point Origin => this._origin; } public class Circle { private CircleData _circleData; public Circle(double radius, Color color, Point origin) { this._circleData = new CircleData(radius, color, origin); } public double Circumference => 2 * this._circleData.Radius * Math.PI; public double Diameter => this._circleData.Radius * 2; public void Draw(Graphics graphics) { //... } } The Circle class in the resulting code has an attribute of type CircleData to encapsulate the attributes previously exposed to all of the methods of the class Circle. That encapsulation prevents methods from changing the attributes after the Circle() constructor. Note, however, that any method of Circle can still retrieve the values of the encapsulated attributes. =Known uses= The Qt framework uses the private class data pattern in its shared libraries. The classes that implement the pattern include a \\"d-pointer\\" to the data class. Methods are provided for manipulating member variables in the data class, allowing changes without breaking binary compatibility. =See also= *Structural pattern for related patterns.

She also handled litigation for the office of the Illinois Attorney's Appellate Prosecutor's Office, where she argued before the Illinois Supreme Court. She is a member of the South Shore Cultural Center Advisory Council, the Jackson Park Advisory Council, and the O'Keeffe Area Council. She was a member of the McFarland Mental Health Center with the Illinois Department of Mental Health and Development Disabilities and a former beat facilitator for CAPS. Hairston is also a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. Aldermanic career Hairston was elected in 1999, when she defeated an incumbent in her first race. She sits on five committees: Buildings; Rules and Ethics; Human Relations; Parks and Recreation; and Special Events and Cultural Affairs. Between January 2008 and July 2009, Hairston hired Chicago political consultant Delmarie Cobb to prepare newsletters and news releases and to publicize ward meetings for the alderman, and paid Cobb thousands of dollars from Hairston's campaign fund, as well as nearly $28,000 from a taxpayer- funded payroll account, available to aldermen with no scrutiny. Hairston was one of only five Chicago aldermen to oppose the privatization of Chicago parking meters. In October 2014, Hairston offered her Facebook followers prizes if they went and voted on November 4. \\"Vote‚Äìyou're eligible no matter the candidate,\\" the Facebook post read. \\"Then put their name and contact information on the back of their voter receipt‚Ä¶. And stop by the Fifth Ward office and drop it off.\\" An election attorney told Chicago Fox News that Hairston's post violated election law because it constituted \\"vote buying\\". According to the law a candidate cannot offer anything of value including money to entice someone to vote one way or the other or simply just to vote. Hairston soon took the post down. Hairston is a member of the Council's Progressive Reform Caucus. In the 2019 Chicago mayoral election, Hairston endorsed Toni Preckwinkle, declaring her support for her in advance of the first round of the election upon Preckwinkle's entrance into the mayoral race.

Stroger (born January 14, 1963) is the former president of the Cook County, Illinois Board and a former alderman for the 8th Ward in Chicago. Stroger is a member of the Democratic Party. In 2001, he was appointed to the Chicago City Council by Richard M. Daley. He is the son of John Stroger who served as Cook County Board president for 12 years until his death. On February 2, 2010, Stroger finished last in the Democratic primary for President of the Cook County Board behind Dorothy A. Brown, Terrence J. O'Brien and Toni Preckwinkle (who won the primary), putting him in a lame duck stage for the remainder of his board presidency. Preckwinkle would go on to win the general election and assume office on December 6, 2010.  Early life  Stroger was raised in the Chatham-Avalon neighborhood, located on Chicago's South Side. He attended Gordon Tech and later received his bachelor's degree from Xavier University in New Orleans. Before becoming an alderman he worked as an investment banker for SBK Brooks Investment Corporation. Political career In 1992, Stroger was elected as State Representative for the 31st District of Illinois. Stroger worked as a statistician for the Office of the Chief Judge of Cook County; later he was also a jury supervisor with the Cook County Jury Commissioners. He worked for the Chicago Park District during the tenure of Forrest Claypool. Stroger is an active fundraiser for the United Negro College Fund and a member of the Young Democrats. =Aldermanic career= In 2001 Stroger was appointed by Mayor Richard M. Daley to replace Lorraine Dixon, who had died while in office. Stroger served on seven committees: Budget and Government Operations; Committees, Rules, and Ethics; Housing and Real Estate; Human Relations; Police and Fire; Special Events and Cultural Affairs; and Traffic Control and Safety. =2006 County Board Presidential nomination= On March 14, 2006, John Stroger, Cook County Board of Commissioners president since 1994 and Todd Stroger's father, suffered a serious stroke one week before the Democratic primary. John Stroger eventually won the Democratic nomination, winning about 53 percent of the votes cast, defeating Forrest Claypool. For months after the elder Stroger's stroke he did not appear in public, and his family provided little information about his condition. Shortly after the stroke, Todd Stroger gave noncommittal responses about the likelihood that his father would remain on the ballot. But in May, he reversed his previous stance, saying his father would return to office. Ultimately, John Stroger would submit his resignation. At the same time that John Stroger submitted his resignation, it was announced that alderman William Beavers would assume the County Commissioner seat while Todd Stroger, if elected, would take over the County Board presidency. This announcement came four days after the deadline for third-party candidates to file for the Board presidency race. In the aftermath of his father's resignation, Todd Stroger emerged as the front-runner for his father's presidential seat. His main opponent was U.S. Representative Danny K. Davis. Another opponent, County Commissioner Bobbie Steele, dropped out of the race shortly before party leaders chose a new candidate. On July 18, 2006, the Cook County Democratic Central Committee (a collection of 80 county Democratic party leaders also known as \\"ward committeemen\\" or \\"township committeemen\\") overwhelmingly chose Todd Stroger to replace his father as the Democratic candidate for Cook County Board president for the Nov. 7, 2006 election. The following day, Steele was unanimously elected by the Board as interim president. According to state election officials, in July 2008, Stroger's campaign paid almost $27,000 in fines for failing to file paperwork in a timely manner. Paperwork was not filed on time for the 2006 election contributions it received along with late organization papers that were sent to the election board. The campaign also filed incomplete and late reports to the State Board of Elections during the week of July 21, 2008, so more fines are expected to be brought forth.  Criticism and response  = Hiring = Stroger drew fire for perceived nepotism, including promoting his cousin Donna Dunnings, who had worked in the County's budget office for 16 years, to the position of the County's chief financial officer. Dunnings and Stroger received additional criticism when she received a $17,000 raise after she initially agreed to not accept a pay hike (in an attempt to help county finances). Dunnings stated that critics could have blocked the pay raise by submitting an amendment to the proposed budget \\"if they were so concerned about the salary of the first African-American female CFO\\". Dunnings was later forced to resign her position after the press reported that she had posted bail for Tony Cole, a former University of Georgia basketball player and busboy whom Stroger had hired to a $60,000/year Cook County position despite Cole's having an extensive felony record. On April 16, 2009, Dunnings resigned at Stroger's request over the scandal involving the hiring of Cole as a human resources assistant in the County Highway Department. Stroger had earlier fired Cole (in Cook County Jail in connection with a domestic violence case at the time Dunnings resigned) for concealing his felony record.Chicago Breaking News Center - Stroger fires cousin over hiring scandal, WGN-TV, April 17, 2009 = Tax increase = Stroger also drew criticism when he began raising certain taxes in an effort to balance the county budget and resolve staffing issues. In September 2007, he voiced his support for a proposal to raise the county-wide sales tax to 11 percent (an additional two cents on the dollar) to remedy a $307 million budget deficit, which would force public facilities such as Stroger Hospital to cut services or even close. Critics of the plan included fellow Commissioners Claypool, Gorman, Peraica, and Mike Quigley who argued that spending cuts would accomplish the same purpose. Peraica additionally responded that Cook County's poorest citizens, who the tax hike is ultimately designed to serve, would find it to be the most unaffordable. Peraica's argument was seconded by then-Governor Rod Blagojevich, who expressed his opposition to the plan. Gorman was instrumental, however, in refusing to back down and she introduced a resolution to repeal the sales tax on three separate occasions, finally winning board majority support on the third effort. On February 29, 2008, the Cook County Board, by a measure of 10-7, passed a budget initiated by Stroger. Stroger's budget contained a tax increase of 1 percentage point, the largest ever passed by Cook County, with the intent of creating more than 1,000 new County jobs. As a result of Stroger's bill, on July 1 the County sales tax increased from 0.75 percent to 1.75 percent bringing Chicago's overall sales tax to 10.25 percent, which was the highest of any major U.S. city, while the sales tax was a minimum of 8.75 percent in suburban Cook County. All five Republican members of the County Board voted against the tax increase and they were joined by two of the twelve Democrats. Commissioners who voted against the tax increase were Peter N. Silvestri, Quigley, Claypool, Gregg Goslin, Timothy Schneider, Peraica, and Elizabeth Ann Doody Gorman. Despite the 133% increase, Dunnings stated on March 31, 2008, that the budget shortfall resolved that year is expected to return. She explained that the expected cost increase would be the result of what she described as a 'structural deficit', meaning increases in revenue being unable to match increases in expense, citing runaway health care costs among other problems. A county spokesman indicated that it would most likely happen in three or four years, well into the next county presidential term. Because of a number of unanswered questions and unresolved issues surrounding the county tax increase, Cook County's outlying communities, particularly Palatine, IL, considered secession and threatened to do so unless an explanation was provided. To avoid this schism, officials from Palatine and Cook County, including Stroger initially, agreed to hold a town hall meeting at Harper College on April 30 to discuss details of the hike that remain unclear. However, on April 29, Stroger announced that he would not attend, accusing Palatine officials of using the meeting for political grandstanding indicating that he \\"[would] not debate local Palatine elected officials who expect to exploit this opportunity to further their own political agendas\\". Eventually, Stroger did attend the Town Hall, which resulted in heavy press coverage and several Daily Herald articles refuting the claims he made while presenting there. The tax increase was later partially rolled back by 0.5%. Chicago's overall sales tax is 9.75% and suburban Cook County is at minimum 8.25%.

History 1970s-era Pittsburgh National Bank logo, used until the 1982 merger to form PNC Bank. PNC's offices in Troy, Michigan. PNC Financial Services traces its history to the Pittsburgh Trust and Savings Company which was founded in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on April 10, 1845. Due to the long recovery from the Great Fire of Pittsburgh, PNC was not fully operational until January 28, 1852. It originally opened offices at Liberty Avenue and 12th Street. The bank was renamed The Pittsburgh Trust Company in 1853. In 1858, the company located its corporate offices to the corner of Fifth Avenue and Wood Street in Pittsburgh, where they remain to this day. The bank changed its name to First National Bank of Pittsburgh in 1863 after it became the first bank in the country to apply for a national charter as part of that year's National Banking Act. It received the 48th charter on August 5, 1863, with other later banks receiving charters sooner due to paperwork problems and the fact that the bank was already in business. In 1946, First National merged with Peoples-Pittsburgh Trust Company, with whom it had worked closely since the 1930s, to form Peoples First National Bank & Trust. In 1959, Peoples First merged with Fidelity Trust Company to form Pittsburgh National Bank. At this time, the bank adopted the first version of its present logo‚Äìa stylized triangle representing the Golden Triangle.PNC corporate history In 1969, the bank reorganized as a holding company, Pittsburgh National Corporation. Another branch of the current bank, the Philadelphia-based Provident National Corporation, dates back to 1865. In 1982, Pittsburgh National Corporation and Provident National Corporation merged into a new entity named PNC Financial Corporation. It was the largest bank merger in American history at the time and created a company with $10.3 billion in assets. Between 1991 and 1996, PNC purchased more than ten smaller banks and financial institutions that broadened its market base from Kentucky to the New York metropolitan area. In 1998, PNC acquired Hilliard Lyons for $275 million in cash and stock. Hilliard Lyons was sold in 2008. In 1998, PNC sold its credit card business to Metris (now HSBC Finance) and MBNA. In the year 2000, the company committed to diversifying their service, thus they adopted a new brand image and changed their name to PNC Financial Services Group. In 2006, PNC got back into the credit card business by marketing and issuing credit cards under the MasterCard brand in partnership with U.S. Bancorp. After the National City merger in 2008, the U.S. Bancorp products were converted to PNC Bank products. =National City acquisition= On October 24, 2008, during the financial crisis of 2007-2008, PNC announced that it would acquire Cleveland-based National City Corp. for $5.2 billion in stock. The announcement came hours after PNC sold preferred stock to the United States Treasury as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program implemented as part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The stock issued to the U.S. Treasury was repurchased in 2010. The deal helped PNC double in size and become the 6th largest bank in the United States by deposit and 5th largest by branches. It also made PNC the largest bank in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Kentucky, as well as the second-largest bank in Maryland and Indiana. It also greatly expanded PNC's presence in the Midwest as well as entering the Florida market. National City complemented PNC's presence, as Western Pennsylvania, Cincinnati and Louisville, Kentucky were among the few markets in which both banks had a major presence. PNC then had its footprint stretch from New York City to St. Louis, Missouri, with branches as far south as Miami and as far north as Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. PNC completed the conversion of the National City branches on June 14, 2010. =Other acquisitions= In 2004, PNC acquired United National Bancorp based in Bridgewater, New Jersey for $321 million in cash and 6.6 million shares of its common stock. In 2005, PNC acquired Riggs National Corporation of Washington, D. C. Riggs had been fined after aiding Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in money laundering. At one stroke, PNC became one of the largest banks in the Washington metropolitan area. On March 2, 2007, PNC acquired Maryland-based Mercantile Bankshares, making PNC the 8th largest bank in the United States by deposits. On October 26, 2007, PNC acquired Yardville National Bancorp, a small commercial bank centered in central New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. On April 4, 2008, PNC acquired Sterling Financial Corporation, a commercial and consumer bank with accounts and branches in central Pennsylvania, northeastern Maryland and Delaware. On September 15, 2007, PNC Bank acquired Citizens National Bank of Laurel, Maryland. On August 14, 2009, PNC took over Dwelling House Savings & Loan and its only branch location in Pittsburgh's Hill District after Dwelling House suffered from bank failure and was placed under receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Dwelling House had been known in Pittsburgh to provide low-income African Americans loans that other banks would deny. The branch was closed and accounts were transferred to the existing PNC branch in the Hill District. In 2011, PNC acquired BankAtlantic's Tampa Bay Area branches. In December 2011, PNC acquired 27 branches in the northern Atlanta suburbs with $240 million in deposits and $42 million in book value from Flagstar Bank.

Of these regions, PNC had existing branches only in Florida and the acquisition filled a gap in PNC's market footprint between northern Virginia and central Florida, adding about 900,000 customers and 483 ATM locations. It made PNC the 5th largest bank by branches behind Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase, and U.S. Bancorp and the 6th largest by total assets behind the aforementioned four banks and Citibank. =Sale of PNC Global Investment Servicing (2010)= Established in 1973, PNC's Global Investment Servicing subsidiary (GIS) was the second-largest full-service mutual fund transfer agent in the U.S and the second-largest full-service accounting and administration provider to U.S. mutual funds. With 4,700 employees, GIS operated from the Republic of Ireland, the United States and the Cayman Islands, and Luxembourg. GIS serviced $1.9 trillion in total assets and 58 million shareholder accounts. In 2007, GIS was awarded a license allowing it to expand further into Europe. PNC Global Investment Servicing was known as PFPC until July 2008. In 2010, PNC sold GIS to The Bank of New York Mellon to repay funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which were used for the National City acquisition. =Construction of The Tower at PNC Plaza= On May 23, 2011, PNC unveiled plans for the Tower at PNC Plaza, a new $400 million headquarters building, originally planned to be 40 stories, to be constructed by the company on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Wood Street in Downtown Pittsburgh, catercorner to the former headquarters, One PNC Plaza. The modern, environmentally friendly, 33-floor, building designed by Gensler opened on October 2, 2015. PNC owns the building and occupies all its space, except for street-level storefronts which are leased to retail tenants. It is one of the world's most environmentally friendly skyscrapers. Some of its features include a double glass facade to reduce cooling costs and promote natural airflow into the building, a high-efficiency climate-control system to heat or cool specific zones of the building as needed, and a pair of living rooftops to collect and channel rainwater and reduce heat gain. =Harris Teeter partnership= On July 30, 2012, PNC announced plans to put ATMs in 138 Harris Teeter grocery stores in the Carolinas, plus 53 other stores. =Post-2012= PNC Bank, Farmers, and Mechanics Branch (2018) In September 2014, PNC acquired Solebury Capital Group, a capital markets advisory firm, for $50 million.

The company ranked 165th on the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue. Legal issues =Overcharging of Black and Hispanic borrowers by National City= In December 2013, the Department of Justice and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that they had reached an agreement with National City Bank to resolve allegations that the bank had charged Black and Hispanic borrowers higher prices for mortgages between 2002 and 2008, before the acquisition by PNC. Regulators claimed that National City had violated the Fair Housing Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act by charging more than 75,000 borrowers higher loan rates based on their race or ethnicity rather than their risk level. National City's lack of pricing guidelines resulted in black borrowers being charged an average of $159 more in extra upfront fees or higher interest than white borrowers. Black borrowers also paid an average of $228 more annually over the life of the loan than white borrowers. Hispanics paid $125 more upfront and $154 more annually than white borrowers. Under the terms of the settlement, PNC was required to pay victims $35 million. = Retailer breach forced PNC to reissue customer cards = In March 2006, PNC and other large banks were forced to reissue hundreds of debit cards to customers after card numbers were disclosed by a breach at an unknown retailer. =Lawsuit from Military Channel= Also in March 2006, PNC Bank was sued by Paul Bariteau, an investor in the Military Channel. Bariteau claimed PNC let the chairman of the Military Channel make unauthorized withdrawals of millions of dollars from the company's account for personal use. =Securities fraud settlement= In June 2003, PNC Bank agreed to pay $115 million to settle federal securities fraud charges after one of its subsidiaries fraudulently transferred $762 million in bad loans and other venture capital investments to an AIG entity in order to conceal them from investors. =Overtime claim by loan officers= In 2017, PNC agreed to pay $16 million to settle claims of overtime wages by loan officers under the Fair Labor Standards Act. =National Prearranged Services Fraud= According to a lawsuit, funds entrusted to National Prearranged Services (NPS), a St.Louis- based company that sold prepaid funerals, were diverted and embezzled. PNC Bank is the successor to Allegiant Bank, which served as a trustee for NPS from 1998 to 2004. In 2015, a jury ordered PNC to pay $391 million. In 2017, a federal judge overturned the decision. =Municipal Bonds Disclosure Violations= In 2015, PNC was one of 22 companies that violated disclosure requirements for municipal bonds by failing to divulge that the issuers had filed late financial reports. It was fined $500,000. Community initiatives PNC has sponsored several initiatives to improve education, health and human services, cultural activities and the arts. These include \\"PNC Grow Up Great\\", a commitment to early childhood development, the \\"PNC Foundation\\", and community development investments. Since 1984, PNC has compiled the Christmas Price Index, a humorous economic indicator which estimates the prices of the items found in the song \\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\\". In 2012, PNC opened the PNC Fairfax Connection, a community center in Cleveland, Ohio. Controversies =Mountaintop Mining= The Earth Quaker Action Team, led by George Lakey, requested that PNC divest in mountaintop mining projects in March 2010. The Quakers were especially sensitive to PNC's investments, as it was informally referred to as \\"The Quaker Bank,\\" due to the fact that Provident Life & Trust Company had been founded by Quakers. After the bank ignored their request, EQAT began to protest. On 29 September 2010, EQAT along with some Swarthmore College students, members of the Rainforest Action Network and Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping protested at a PNC bank in Washington, D.C. by building a small mountain made of dirt. Police arrested the leader George Lakey and three others. \\"In October of 2010, PNC announced that they would stop loaning money to companies that gained over 50% of their coal from mountaintop removal. However, none of the companies with which PNC conducted business produced that much coal via mountaintop removal, and thus the new policy did not represent change. Soon after the bank‚Äôs new commitment, PNC gave money to Massey Energy, a company found responsible for poor safety conditions that led to the deaths of thirty-one miners in April 2009. Unsatisfied by PNC‚Äôs ineffective policy, EQAT staged another protest on 17 December 2010. Protesters sang Christmas carols while delivering stockings full of coal to a PNC Bank in Media, Pennsylvania.\\" Students at Temple University and Swarthmore College held sit-ins to protest the bank, and EQAT next protested PNC by conducting Quaker-style worship (sitting in silence until let to speak) during a shareholders meeting in D.C. \\"At the end of the meeting, the activists gave a gift bag to CEO James Rohr with a framed picture of the Appalachian Mountains and a pamphlet about the dangers of mountaintop removal.\\" Over time, protests became more and more elaborate and creative. September 22, 2011, EQAT charged PNC with \\"impersonating a green bank\\" and held a trial in the PNC lobby. Two weeks later, they held a \\"die-in\\" alongside activists from Occupy Philadelphia, where protesters acted dead by laying on the floor of a PNC bank. December 6, 2011, police arrested five EQAT members for constructing windmills (a clean alternative to coal) inside of the downtown PNC bank. In February 2012, EQAT convinced various Quaker groups to withdraw nearly two million dollars (later increased to over three million) invested with PNC, and in April of that year, EQAT along with students from various colleges, protested by dancing to bluegrass music next to the University of Pennsylvania‚Äôs PNC campus branch. April 30, 2012, EQAT members began a 200-mile walk from Philadelphia to the PNC Bank headquarters in Pittsburgh. EQAT held a series of protests at PNC branches along the way. In October 2012, activist students began to approach PNC bank managers, asking them to drink well water from affected communities in Appalachia. On March 14, 2013, EQAT members began a collective 40-day fast (not all members fasted the entire time), making their fasts public through social media. During the fast, members publicly protested dressed in traditional Quaker costumes when the Philadelphia Chamber of Congress awarding PNC's J. William Mills with the William Penn Award. The fast ended on 23 April with a worship session in the middle of a PNC shareholder meeting. On October 21, 2013, EQAT staged the largest bank branch protest in U.S. history. Activists protested by holding silent worship inside sixteen PNC bank branches, most of which were in Pittsburgh, leading many of the branches to shut down for the day. Seven protesters were arrested by Pittsburgh police after refusing to leave. By 2014, the movement had spread across the country. Protesters again held Quaker worship inside of the PNC shareholders meeting, despite the fact that the location had been moved to Tampa, Florida. On December 6, 2014, thirty protests were held in branches across twelve states. Finally in February 2015, after five years and 125 separate protests, PNC Bank announced it would officially stop investing in mountaintop removal coal mining.

He is a Democrat. Hansen was elected to the Chicago City Council in 1983 when the incumbent alderman, John Merlo, retired. In 1987 he defeated Dr. Ron Sable, a liberal gay activist, by a 52% to 47% margin in the race for 44th Ward alderman. It was a hard-fought campaign in the city's 44th Ward, which at the time was the heart of the city's gay community. Sable ran against Hansen again in 1991, but Hansen prevailed again, 65% to 35%. From 1994 to 2000, he served as one of four U.S. commissioners to the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, a presidential appointment to a bilateral treaty organization with Canada responsible for fisheries management research and recommendations and for sea lamprey control for the Great Lakes fisheries. For part of that time, he chaired the commission. During Council Wars Hansen was generally aligned with the \\"Vrdolyak 29,\\" the block of mostly white aldermen who opposed Mayor Harold Washington. He sponsored or co-sponsored several human rights ordinances, including the Human Rights Ordinance expanding protection against discrimination in housing, employment, public accommodations, and credit to gay males, lesbians, and persons with disabilities, an ordinance to assist victims of hate crimes, and a 1997 ordinance Hansen introduced to extend health-care benefits to the domestic partners of gay and lesbian city employees. Thomas M. Tunney, his successor as 44th Ward alderman whom Hansen had \\"hand-picked\\", became Chicago's first openly gay alderman. Hansen was also an active proponent of environmentalist measures, including recycling programs and the extension of Chicago's moratorium against the creation of new landfills. Some residents of the Lakeview community voiced concern that Hansen was more concerned with building expensive condos and co-ops, then re-building the neighborhood with affordable housing during his tenure. He serves on the board of many community councils as well as fund raising organizations, including the John Merlo Sports Program. After his retirement from the city council, he continued to serve as Democratic committeeman from the 44th Ward, ultimately handing over the title to Alderman Tom Tunney. John Merlo held the position from 1969-92. Hansen made an attempt to be a Democratic Congressional Candidate for Illinois's 5th congressional district in 2002, but when the Democratic National Committee backed Clinton Administration staffer Rahm Emanuel in the race, Hansen withdrew and soon after resigned from the 44th Ward Aldermanic seat. He is married to Annette and has two sons, Paul and David. He has two grandchildren. He attended the University of Chicago and has residences in both Chicago and Arizona.

Tunney considered running for mayor in 2011, but ultimately did not. In 2013, Tunney denied unattributed published reports that he supported moving or demolish the iconic scoreboard at Wrigley Field to clear the view for nearby rooftops owners. Tunney has had an often adversarial relationship with the Ricketts family, current owners of the Chicago Cubs, whose stadium, Wrigley Field, is located in his ward.

Before becoming Alderman Levar worked as an assistant to the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County from 1974 until 1987. Alderman Levar was one of the so-called \\"Vrdolyak 29\\" opponents to Mayor Harold Washington.

She served in the Chicago City Council for six four-year terms, from 1987 to 2011. Shiller was elected to the City Council on her third attempt, as Harold Washington, Chicago's first black Mayor, was re-elected to his second term, and her election as alderman helped close the Council Wars era in Chicago government. Shiller has been described as \\"committed to liberal causes and destroying all within her path\\". Among her most significant impacts on Chicago were her advocacy for diverse, inclusive, affordable housing and helping craft Chicago's response to the HIV/AIDS crisis. Her commitment to fostering community development without displacement often brought Shiller into contention with some constituencies, real estate developers, and editorial boards. Shiller's oral history was collected by Pulitzer Prize- winning author and Uptown resident Studs Terkel in his 2003 book, Hope Dies Last.  Early life and education  Shiller was born in 1947 and raised on Long Island in New York, growing up in a middle-class family. Her parents were home owners. Her father, Morris Shiller, was a self-employed chemist who emigrated to the United States from Latvia. Some members of his family were Holocaust victims. Shiller's mother was Sara (n√©e Trop), Sara was born and raised in Belarus, where she lived through various occupations, including by the Germans, Polish, Russians, and Soviet Union. Sara came to America through Ellis Island at the age of six. She became a nurse and married Morris, in 1936. She died at the age of 96 in the summer of 2011. Helen Shiller earned her high school diploma in 1965 from Woodstock County School in Vermont, the same progressive boarding school that Pete Seeger's children attended. Shiller graduated with a degree in history from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where she was active in the anti-Vietnam war movement and in the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). In 2005, Shiller graduated from DePaul University's School for New Learning Master's Program, where her focus was public policy.  Early career  Shiller moved to Chicago's Uptown neighborhood in 1972 with her husband Marc Zalkin and her infant son, Brendan, and lived on N Malden Street in Uptown. Shiller drove a cab, worked as a waitress and freelance photographer, and got involved in radical politics. With one of Chicago's most controversial political organizers, Walter \\"Slim\\" Coleman, Shiller helped organize the Intercommunal Survival Committee, a sort of white support arm of the Black Panther Party. The committee evolved into the Heart of Uptown Coalition, a political and social service organization steeped in the rhetoric of Marxism; \\"comrades\\" were expected to organize \\"cadres.\\" \\"We must have the frame of mind that as revolutionaries we have (to) be able to solve any problem that comes our way ...\\" Shiller said. The Coalition provided an array of programs geared toward providing essential services for the poor, including medical clinics for pregnant women, mothers and young children; a legal aid clinic, food pantries and distributing clothes and meals to the poor. For decades Shiller and her allies worked to preserve Uptown as the last North Side lakefront neighborhood south of Rogers Park that is home to a significant population of low income households. Shiller supported Michael Bakalis in his 1978 primary challenge to Illinois Governor James R. Thompson, attacking Thompson for \\"making deals with the Chicago machine\\" and for being unsympathetic to the urban poor. Shiller helped open an extension of Shimer College at 4833 N Broadway in the Fall of 1978. Shiller took on Illinois' dentists when in 1978 the Uptown Peoples Community Services Center joined consumers groups in a federal lawsuit which attempted to break up dentists' monopoly on fitting dentures. From 1981 to 1987, Shiller was President and CEO of Justice Graphics, Inc. a print shop, a small business of which Shiller and Coleman were two of five owners. In 2003 Shiller recalled the period: > I was as student in the sixties, engaged in the civil rights movement, anti- > Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of > Wisconsin. It was an exciting time. A lot of active students wound up in > different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I > spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic and we had a whole > health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about > Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. I waited > tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we > started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and > magazines. Campaigns for alderman = First campaign for alderman (1978) = A special election was called for May 16, 1978 in the 46th Ward when Alderman Chris Cohen, first elected in 1971, was re-elected in 1975 but retired in mid- term to head the Chicago regional office of the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. On March 6, 1978 Ralph Axelrod, chief administrative assistant to Cook County Sheriff Richard Elrod, and ward committeeman since 1973, slated himself for alderman. At the time, Shiller was 30 years old and the editor of Keep Strong, a leftist magazine. Shiller's first attempt at elected office was to join a multi-way challenge to Axelrod. \\"I ran for alderman of this [46th] ward in 1978. I was terrified. I was very shy, afraid to speak to more than five people at a time,\\" Shiller recalled in 2003. Shiller picked up much of the support that Young Lords founder and leader Jose Cha Cha Jimenez had in Jimenez' unsuccessful challenge to Cohen in the 1975 elections. He was running primarily as a defence against the FBI's CointelPro repressive program and to expose the displacement of Latino and lower income areas from the lakefront and near downtown by the Richard J. Daley machine. He still received 39% of the vote coming in second in a three- way race. Shiller's base of support was the same geographic center of the ward, an area of high density, low-income families between Broadway and Clark Street. Shiller campaigned pledging to work to keep the disadvantaged of Uptown from being displaced by gentrification. Independents including Aldermen Dick Simpson (44th), Martin J. Oberman (43rd), and Ross Lathrop (5th), and former alderman and mayoral candidate William Singer (43rd), endorsed Angela Turley, founder of the Organization of the Northeast (ONE), a community group. Turley was also unanimously endorsed by the 46th Ward Citizens Search Committee, a group of 50 ward residents who interviewed 10 candidates. Turley and another candidate Carl Lezak, a former priest and former director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), were challenged and stricken from the ballot by the Chicago Board of Elections Commissioners, leaving a three-way race for alderman between Axelrod, Shiller, and former television news reporter Michael Horowitz. Shiller charged that the regular Democratic organization used unfair campaign practices against her, challenging about 100 of the 400 new voters she helped register, stealing her campaign posters, and pressuring store owners to remove her signs. The Chicago Tribune endorsed Axelrod, noting Shiller \\"runs primarily as a champion of the poor.\\" Axelrod prevailed, receiving 5,575 votes, or 54.5%, to Shiller's 3,475 votes. =Second campaign for alderman (1979)= Shiller and Turley challenged Axelrod in 1979. An extra alarm fire early on Friday, February 9, 1979, weeks before the election, caused extensive damage to the building containing Shiller's campaign headquarters and left 15 homeless. The Chicago Tribune endorsed Axelrod. Shiller (6,852 votes; 46%) bested Axelrod (6,088 votes; 40%), but, as no candidate received a majority of the vote in the three-way race, a run-off was forced. The Chicago Tribune and Turley endorsed Axelrod in the run-off. The Chicago Tribune wrote that \\"Ms. Shiller's program shares many elements with that of the Black Panthers and appears to be based on hopes of an eventual \\"revolution\\" [not defined].\\" Turley described Axelrod as \\"the lesser of two evils in the race now.\\" Axelrod enlisted 40 volunteer attorneys and 200 off-duty policemen to challenge ghost voting in a project he called \\"Operation Safeguard.\\" Axelrod challenged 1,060 voter registrations on the ward's rolls, 931 of which were upheld by the Chicago Board of Elections Commissioners. Axelrod defeated Shiller in the run-off by 247 votes. Shiller later recalled the campaign: > I won the primary, but not with fifty-one percent of the vote. We had a > runoff and I lost by two hundred votes ‚Äì to a machine candidate. We were > bringing fresh ideas, but we were not experienced in fighting the machine on > election day. I swore I'd never run for alderman again. There was so much > racial baiting that it was terrifying. I was called names. ... My posters > had black paint all over them with racial epithets. It was very disturbing. =Third campaign for alderman (1987)= In Harold Washington's successful first campaign for Mayor of Chicago in the 1983 municipal elections, Shiller was employed as the campaign organizer for the 46th Ward. Shiller owned and operated a print shop, Justice Graphics, that printed the campaign literature for Washington's first mayoral campaign. Justice Graphics published the All- Chicago City News, a 40,000 circulation pro-Washington, left-wing, bilingual, biweekly newspaper edited by Shiller and Walter \\"Slim\\" Coleman. Coleman formed a plan to register 100,000 new voters for Washington by canvassing public aid offices and became a close advisor to candidate and, later, Mayor Harold Washington. Just before the 1983 elections, Alderman Axelrod resigned from City Council to take a job in the Cook County Sheriff's office. Community activist Charlotte Newfeld and Jerome Orbach ran for alderman and went to a run-off, which Orbach won by 66 votes. Orbach allied with Edward Vrdolyak and the Vrdolyak 29 during Council Wars. \\"Harold was mayor, and he was harping on me to run for alderman,\\" Shiller recalled in 2003. In 1987, Shiller, Nancy Kaszak, and Gerald Pechenuk challenged Orbach. Kaszak was a lawyer, a former vice president of the Chicago Council of Lawyers, a Mayor Harold Washington appointee to the Commission on Chicago Landmarks, a leader of the Lakeview Citizens' Council, and president of Citizens United for Baseball in Sunshine (CUBS), which opposed night baseball at Wrigley Field. Newfeld co-chaired Kaszak's campaign. Pechenuk was a consultant for Lyndon LaRouche Jr. for 12 years, and was treasurer of LaRouche-supported Sheila Jones's mayoral campaign. Shiller challenged Pechenuk's nominating petitions. Mayor Washington endorsed 18 incumbent aldermen and 5 challengers, including Shiller. Washington appeared at a joint rally with Shiller at which she announced her candidacy. Kaszak was endorsed by the Chicago Sun-Times, the Independent Voters of Illinois-Independent Precinct Organization (IVI-IPO), the National Organization for Women (NOW), the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), and former aldermen William Singer and Dick Simpson. The Chicago Tribune endorsed Orbach. Shiller charged that Orbach catered to developers, displacing people in the wake of rehabilitation that priced housing out of the reach of many, and said she wanted community zoning boards, with their decisions binding on the alderman. Shiller charged that most of Orbach's campaign war chest was from developers and regular Democrats outside the ward. In the four-way race, Orbach took 40% of the vote and Shiller 38%, but, no candidate received a majority, resulting in a run-off. Kaszak endorsed Shiller, although many of Kaszak's followers supported Orbach. Orbach tried to position himself on both sides of the pro-/anti-Washington political fence, and late in the campaign attempted to stage a public conversion to pro-Washington positions. Some prominent independents, such as Alderman Marion Volini (48th), state Representative Ellis Levin and state Senator William A. Marovitz, endorsed Orbach, as did the Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Tribune. \\"His [Orbach's] relationship to large real estate developers is very important. He's become more of an advocate for people outside of the ward than for people here,\\" Shiller charged. Some of Orbach's allies spread a rumor, aimed at lakefront Jewish voters, that as alderman Shiller would support a Palestinian state. Shiller's forces called Orbach a racist, although a large number of blacks backed Orbach in his early campaigns. Shiller later said, > The machine alderman who won in 1983 [Orbach] had a chief of staff who was > engaging in racial organizing. There were white gangs up here. One of them > he helped organize into a consciously racially white-power gang. They hooked > up with both the Klan and the Nazi Party. In the months leading up to the election, the Heart of Uptown Coalition and a Shiller supporter who was director of the Center for Street People, 4455 N. Broadway, organized a voter registration drive that registered 80 homeless people using the Center's address, and on election day fed them a meal at a local church hall and helped them vote. Jesus People USA, a 500-member commune/business/charity/religious group with many members living in the ward, had supported Orbach throughout his career, but switched to Shiller before the run-off. Jesus People's spokesman explained \\"We think Jerry Orbach is a lovely man, but he doesn't have what it takes to stand up to the development ... If things keep going there will be massive displacement. People will be thrown out of their homes. We decided that Helen Shiller would do the most to prevent displacement.\\" Orbach supporters charged that a City official had offered City contracts to the Jesus People's construction firm if Shiller were elected. On Tuesday, April 7, 1987 Shiller defeated Orbach by 498 votes, 9,751 to 9,253, and contributed to a narrow, pro-Washington, reform-minded majority in the City Council which helped draw the Council Wars era to close.  Aldermanic career  In her six terms as alderman, Shiller served on eight committees: Budget and Government Operations; Buildings; Committees, Rules and Ethics; Finance; Health; Housing and Real Estate; Human Relations; and License and Consumer Protection. = First term (1987‚Äì1991) = On December 16, 1987, Shiller was among the supporters of the 1988 City budget, proposed by Washington in late 1987 and passed 29-19 under Mayor Eugene Sawyer after Washington's death in office. Shiller was among opponents of Sawyer's 1989 budget, approved 34-13 on December 7, 1988. In January, 1988, Shiller was named one of \\"88 People to Watch\\" by Chicago Tribune staff. Shiller was Mayor Richard M. Daley's staunchest opponent in City Council votes in the last three months of 1989, in Daley's first year of his first term. In 1989, Shiller sponsored a resolution creating a sub-committee on Domestic Violence. Shiller backed a group of 50 to 75 people including more than 40 homeless people and six children who erected a \\"tent city\\" from doors and wood on a vacant lot at 4425 N. Malden to illustrate the plight of the homeless. On Friday, October 14, 1989 Shiller was among five arrested when police, called by the owner, evicted about 100 protesters from the lot. Shiller was charged with trespassing and spent \\"about two minutes\\" in jail before charges were dropped.  Uptown Chicago Commission funding  In November, 1987, Shiller's first budget cycle, she recommended to the Budget Committee that the City cancel a federal grant for the Uptown Chicago Commission (UCC), a 32-year-old community group in Uptown that often contended on issues with the Heart of Uptown Coalition, of which Shiller was co-chairman with Walter \\"Slim\\" Coleman. The recommendation came during Budget Committee hearings on the distribution of $95.1 million in federal Community Development Block Grants. Mayor Washington's budget recommendation included a $20,000 grant to UCC to facilitate residents applying for home improvement loans. The UCC's service area included the adjoining 48th Ward, whose Alderman Kathy Osterman also supported the funding. Shiller requested that the committee deny the UCC its grant. Shiller accused the UCC of helping developers displace low-income Uptown residents. After heated debate, the Budget Committee voted 9‚Äì5 in favor of Shiller's amendment to remove the grant for the UCC. Upon the death of Mayor Washington in office, Shiller supported Alderman Timothy C. Evans for mayor, but supporters of Alderman Eugene Sawyer prevailed. Weeks later, at the first City Council meeting under Mayor Sawyer, the UCC funding was restored. Shiller said restoring the grant to the UCC would affect only the 48th Ward, not her ward. \\"I was not going to have them operating in the 46th,\\" Shiller said, claiming she had reached an agreement to keep UCC services out of her ward several days before Washington's death. \\"Mayor Sawyer had nothing to do with this,\\" Shiller claimed. \\"He had recommended no changes.\\"  Low-income housing consent decree  As early as 1966 Uptown was among the possible sites proposed for a northeast-side commuter campus in the City Colleges of Chicago community college district. The Uptown site west of the Wilson Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) station was opposed by those concerned for the displacement of low income residents, largely blacks, southern whites and American Indians. The project was mired in heated controversy for decades. Avery v Pierce, a federal lawsuit filed in 1975, alleged that the razing of about 3,000 low-income housing units for the development of Harry S Truman College constituted misspending of funds by the City and Chicago Housing Authority. Plaintiffs were represented by Shiller's former campaign manager, attorney James P. Chapman of the Uptown Peoples Law Center. In 1985 Randall H. Langer, a young real estate developer active in apartment rehabilitation in the neighborhood, aided the creation of a local historic district, the Sheridan Park Historic District, which critics charged was of dubious historical value and created to facilitate gentrification. Nineteen tax delinquent properties in Uptown were offered for sale by auction by Cook County in Fall, 1987. Since 1983 Cook County had a program to afford local governments the opportunity to acquire tax delinquent properties for almost nothing, prior to the county's scavenger sale to the public, if the local government had a specific development plan. On October 28, 1987, Shiller urged the Tax Delinquency Subcommittee of the Cook County Board to accept a no-cash bid from the City for the 19 tax-delinquent parcels in Uptown. A decision was deferred when Commissioner Rosemarie Love requested a delay on grounds that the Washington administration had not provided a development plan. Subcommittee chairman Commissioner Richard Siebel said the County's no-cash sales program was \\"designed to place property back on the tax rolls as quickly as possible ‚Äì not for land-banking. It's not appropriate for us to pass this until the city tells us, parcel by parcel, what they intend to do and how they plan to pay for it.\\" Another commissioner noted that the City already owned 7,000 tax-delinquent properties, and another added, \\"Properties we gave to the city 12 years ago are still war zones. I don't want the same thing to happen here.\\" As a bench ruling in Avery v Pierce neared, Shiller proposed an ordinance that directed the city to settle and accept a consent decree. The consent decree would have put most vacant parcels in Uptown into a land bank for future affordable housing, administered by a community development corporation, funded by the City with $100,000 over two years. The consent decree also would have made a \\"desirable\\" goal of 3,000 low-income housing units in Uptown. On November 16, 1987, the Committee on Finance of the Chicago City Council, chaired at the time by Shiller ally Alderman Timothy Evans, voted 21 to 2 to recommend the consent decree. Shiller gloated during committee hearings that, with Mayor Harold Washington's backing, the decree could not be stopped. Pulitzer Prize-winning commentator Mike Royko wrote in the Chicago Tribune: > One of the most depressing sections of Chicago is the Uptown area on the > North Side. Shabby apartment buildings, vacant stores, wino bars, littered > vacant lots, junkies, muggers, and career down-and-outers. It also has a new > alderman, Helen Shiller, and she has a vision of what that seedy old > neighborhood should be in the future. And apparently her vision is that > Uptown should remain a seedy old neighborhood. In 1988 Royko wrote of Shiller, \\"her main motive was that she was building a political power base, which included as many winos as she and Coleman could drag to the voting booth.\\" Shiller's proposal was criticized in a series of editorials. The Chicago Tribune called the proposal \\"silly,\\" editorializing: > It would have enabled her [Shiller] to strangle commercial development in > her Uptown ward and keep it poor. ... It was a flagrantly bad idea and > deserved its defeat. It would have put Helen Shiller and her sidekick, Slim > Coleman, in charge of a \\"community development corporation\\" whose avowed > purpose would be to block private investment in the 46th Ward and use all > available space for low-cost housing. This would consolidate their own power > by ensuring a constituency of poor and dependent voters. In 2003 Shiller explained the editorials: > When I first became alderman, there was a developer up here who felt very > threatened by me. He hired a publicist to really go after me. Any time I > talked about development without displacement, they would ream me. They went > to the press and got some of the most vicious editorials published. On December 3, 1987 16 of the parcels were sold to private bidders at Cook County's annual scavenger sale, and Langer and partnerships Langer controlled bought 13 of the parcels. On December 9, 1987, at the first regular business meeting of the City Council after the death of Mayor Washington in office, Washington foes brought the proposal out of committee. Alderman Bernard Stone joined Alderman Osterman in blocking the agreement, saying Shiller's \\"arrogance prevailed and that arrogance has to be answered on this floor.\\" The Council rejected the consent decree 29-17. = Second term (1991‚Äì1995) = In 1991, Shiller supported Danny K. Davis in Davis' unsuccessful primary challenge to Daley. Daley endorsed Shiller's challenger, Michael Quigley, campaigned with Quigley and sent letters in support of Quigley. Shiller finished seven votes ahead of Quigley, but a third candidate got 3.4% of the vote, which forced a runoff, the third straight run-off for Shiller and the fourth straight for the 46th ward. In the run-off, Shiller won with 53% of the vote, amid charges that Quigley was a carpetbagger. Shiller added a budget amendment to triple the city's AIDS budget in 1992. Shiller was one of nine alderman voting against Daley's 1993 budget, which included a $28.7 million property tax increase. Shiller was absent for the 1994 budget vote, and was one of four aldermen dissenting on Daley's 1995 budget. = Third term (1995‚Äì1999) = The Chicago Tribune was among newspapers that endorsed Shiller for re-election in 1995, and she won with 57% of the vote, without a run-off. Shiller supported U.S. Representative Bobby Rush in his unsuccessful challenge to Daley in 1999. \\"Arguably, the single most important legislative responsibility that aldermen have is voting on the city budget each year,\\" Shiller said. She was the lone dissenting vote on Daley's 1996, 1997 and 1998 budgets. During hearings on Daley's 1996 budget, which included a $19.5 million property-tax increase, she submitted 123 questions on the budget in writing to department heads, but only 35 were answered. She objected to the tax increase in a period of several years of budget surpluses. She attended every hearing on Daley's 1997 budget armed with policy questions that she said went unanswered. She was often the only alderman present at budget hearings. = Fourth term (1999‚Äì2003) = In 1999, Sandra Reed, a black high school English teacher, and two other women opposed Shiller, the first all-female field in an aldermanic race in Chicago history. The Chicago Tribune again endorsed Shiller. Shiller prevailed with 55% of the vote in a runoff. Shiller was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame as a Friend of the Community in 2000. On November 17, 1999, Shiller joined in unanimous support for Daley's 2000 budget, her first affirmative vote on a Daley budget and only her second affirmative vote on a City budget. Aldermen applauded. Shiller again joined in unanimous support for Daley's 2001, 2002, and 2003 budgets. In the 2001 redistricting of Chicago wards, Daley tried to deprive Shiller of her most committed supporters, but failed when none of the aldermen in adjacent wards wanted to contend with Shiller's supporters. Shiller and Daley, however, reached an understanding: the mayor supported her in the 2003 elections and also pushed forward development of Wilson Yard, a Chicago Transit Authority facility destroyed by fire, into affordable housing and a Target store, using the Wilson Yard Tax Increment Financing District and the $26.5 million it generated. Subsequently, Shiller consistently voted in support of the mayor's agenda. = Fifth term (2003-2007) = Shiller and Daley supported each other for re-election in 2003. Shiller cited Daley's commitment to affordable housing, and in particular his Planning Department's work on the Wilson Yard project. Columnist Mark Brown wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times, > The last squeaky wheel in the City Council had been greased. The last > independent voice had joined the chorus ... Shiller's endorsement of Daley > is all the more amazing when you look at where she started, about as close > to a Marxist as you'd ever find at City Hall. Shiller defeated Reed again in 2003, this time with 58% of the vote. Shiller again joined in unanimous support for Daley's 2004 budget. Shiller was the only alderman who did not cast a vote on the passage of the Big Box Ordinance, which required large retailers to pay a living wage. Target sent a letter to Mayor Daley and alderman indicating that if the ordinance were not overturned, they would not proceed on projects in Chicago. Shiller voted to sustain Daley's veto. = Sixth term (2007‚Äì2011) = Criticism of Shiller in the 2007 election largely focused on the lack of communication with ward residents, failure to obtain input from residents for zoning changes in the ward, her lack of involvement in community policing meetings, and the many years of blighted retail in the ward. Some critics charged that Shiller was frustrating developers while using the Wilson Yard project to maintain her political base. In 2007, Shiller defeated social worker James Cappleman with 53% of the vote. In October, 2007, Shiller became chair of the City Council's Human Relations Committee. In 2009, Shiller was criticized by Uptown residents for her perceived lack of engagement in addressing crime in the neighborhood, including a string of violent robberies in nearby Lakeview that attracted the attention of the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times, and local TV news. Police interviewed said interventions from Shiller and her staff facilitated the protection of gang members from policing activity, allegedly for gaining voter base, according to a report in Chicago Magazine. Mayor Daley was among supporters of the Wilson Yard redevelopment project celebrating the completion of construction on July 20, 2010. The project included 98 units of subsidized housing for low-income residents in two buildings, one for seniors, and another for other families. The Target store opened on Sunday, July 22, 2010. On August 2, 2010, Shiller announced she would not run for re-election in 2011. Shiller reflected, > ... we should be able to make sure that everyone has a place in the city, > and when we do development ... we should make sure that the people who are > here today will be here when that is complete ... my most singular > perspective was to prove that that is possible. ... we have to have a city > that is not just inclusive about our diversity but is serious and honest > about making sure that everyone has a place here ... On closing her ward office, Shiller wrote: > I am most proud of my achievements in tripling the City's funding budget for > HIV/AIDS victims and for developing the toughest stance on Apartheid that > was ever written in the 90's, for my work on domestic violence issues and > establishing 24-hour daycare for children, the Ruth Shriman House for senior > living, the Wilson Yards Development and for welcoming Target as a neighbor > and partner, and of course setting the bar for affordable housing in > Chicago. Personal life Shiller separated from her husband Mark Zalkin, one of Mayor Harold Washington's assistant press secretaries, and with Shiller a leader of the 46th Ward Community Service Center (later the Uptown Community Service Center) and an editor of Keep Strong magazine, and with Shiller and Coleman an editor of All-Chicago City News. Zalkin died on February 23, 1998 at age 49 due to complications from multiple sclerosis. Shiller and Zalkin have one son, Brendan Shiller. Brendan attended Joseph Stockton Elementary School, a Chicago Public School, and Whitney Young Magnet High School, a selective-enrollment public magnet high school in Chicago's Near West Side. While attending Truman College, Brendan was managing editor of All-Chicago City News. After Truman, Brendan went to Howard University in Washington, D.C. For two years starting in February, 1997 Brendan edited StreetWise, a street newspaper sold by people without homes or those at-risk for homelessness in Chicago. In 2003, Brendan graduated first in his class from John Marshall Law School and currently works as a lawyer representing criminal defendants and police misconduct plaintiffs. One of Shiller‚Äôs granddaughters is the published poet Britteney Black Rose Kapri. Helen Shiller and her long-time staff member Maggie Marystone were interviewed in separate chapters in Hope Dies Last, a collection of oral histories by Pulitzer Prize-winning author and Uptown resident Studs Terkel.

O'Connor (born June 21, 1955) is a former Chicago politician. He is the former alderman in Chicago's City Council representing the 40th Ward on the North Side of the city. He was first elected in 1983 at age 28. His tenure ended in May 2019 after his loss to challenger Andre Vasquez in the 2019 Chicago aldermanic elections. O'Connor was an unsuccessful candidate in the Democratic Party primary election for Illinois's 5th congressional district special election, 2009.Spielman, Fran Ald. O'Connor now the favorite to get backing for Emanuel's seat Chicago Sun-Times, January 6, 2009 Early life O'Connor is the son of a Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Streets and Sanitation, Bureau of Equipment Services, under Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley. O'Connor graduated from Loyola University of Chicago School of Law in 1979. Fresh from law school, O'Connor successfully sued the city for back pay for his father after Mayor Jane Byrne fired him.  Chicago City Council (1983‚Äì2019)  O'Connor was first elected alderman for the 40th Ward in 1983. He was subsequently reelected eight times, in 1987, 1991, 1995, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2015. In 2019, he was denied a tenth term on the City Council, being unseated by challenger Andre Vasquez. = Council Wars = During the tenure of Mayor Harold Washington, who was black, O'Connor, who is white, caucused with the mostly-white opposition block in City Council known as the \\"Vrdolyak 29\\". O'Connor chaired the City Council's Committee on Education as a freshman alderman. = Investigations and controversies = In his first term a federal grand jury investigated O'Connor for providing, in late 1983 and again in late 1984, year-end jobs on the Education Committee staff for fifteen persons, including his mother-in-law, his brother-in-law, his sister-in-law, wives of two former members of his law firm, and the wife of a former staff aide. Some of those hired admitted they did not realize they were on the City payroll. \\"All in the Family\\" was a popular name for O'Connor's hiring practices, and O'Connor became known as the \\"City Hall Santa.\\" O'Connor compared his hiring practices to those of Britain's royal family. When asked at a City Hall news conference if the practice amounted to nepotism, O'Connor said: \\"Absolutely. I think nepotism is a system that has been around a long time. It has worked very well in England. I don't think it's been much more of a problem here.\\" O'Connor and the ward organization he chairs, the 40th Ward Regular Democratic Organization, were cited in a complaint filed on August 31, 2005 with the Illinois State Board of Elections by the Cook County Republican Party. The complaints charged that sixteen Democratic Party ward organizations are illegally housed in City-funded neighborhood ward offices. Taxpayers fund aldermanic service centers, which are open to the public. State law prohibits the use of public funds by any candidate for political or campaign purposes. The complaint against O'Connor and his ward organization was one of nine that a Hearing Officer appointed by the Board recommended proceed to the next step of the hearing process, an Open Preliminary Hearing. On October 17, 2005, at a regularly scheduled meeting, the Board entered an executive session and voted, in a 4-4 tie, along strict party lines, failing to adopt the recommendation of the Hearing Officer, and ordered the complaints dismissed. The complaint against O'Connor and his ward organization was one of eight that the Cook County Republican Party appealed all the way to the Illinois Supreme Court. On January 23, 2009, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously ordered the Illinois appellate court to conduct a judicial review of the Board's dismissals of the complaints. On December 19, 2009, the First District of the Illinois appellate court affirmed the Illinois State Board of Elections' dismissal of the complaints. In 2008 O'Connor was found to be one of seven Chicago aldermen who between them got ten of their children good-paying summer jobs with the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago. In May 2013, O'Connor suggested that the Catholic Church and other religious institutions and not for profit organizations should pay property taxes and be billed for water provided by the City of Chicago. O'Connor's comments were in support of a plan by Mayor Rahm Emanuel to charge such organizations for water which had traditionally been provided without charge to not for profit organizations. ‚ÄúThe silliest things can be said and people latch onto it.‚Äù O‚ÄôConnor said. ‚ÄúFor Chrissake, we sell everybody water! And now all of a sudden because we‚Äôre a church, we‚Äôre not supposed to sell them water? At some point, i think what‚Äôs gonna happen is someone‚Äôs gonna say how about looking at property taxes? We‚Äôll give ya free water. How about paying for the property you own.‚Äù O'Connor further suggested that the Catholic Church should not criticize the plan to bill it for water use, but ought to address its clerical abuse scandals. O'Connor is married to Barbara O'Connor, a real estate broker. In the last decade Barbara has built a successful business selling houses and condos, many of which could not have been built without zoning changes enacted by the city council. Barbara sold more than $22 million worth of houses and condos in the 40th ward after the projects were enabled by Alderman O'Connor.  Unsuccessful campaigns for other offices  In 1990, O'Connor was defeated by Cecil Partee in a four-way race for the Democratic nomination for Cook County State's Attorney in the Democratic primary on March 20, 1990, with Partee garnering 49% of the vote to O'Connor's 37.5%. O'Connor was defeated in his challenge to Republican incumbent Jack O'Malley in a campaign for Cook County State's Attorney in the general election of November 3, 1992, with O'Malley garnering 62% of the vote to O'Connor's 38%. O'Connor lost to O'Malley in O'Connor's own ward, 8,516 to 9,363.

It chronicles William Jennings Bryan's 1896 presidential campaign as seen through the eyes of an idealistic sixteen-year-old, who strongly supported the Democratic Party candidate and was crushed by Bryan's defeat at the hands of the Republican Party. The narrator depicts the election outcome as a victory of the East Coast and large financial institutions, such as J.P. Morgan & Company, over regions and interest groups depicted as friendly toward Bryan such as the American Midwest and farmers. The poem lists, and comments on, many of the key political figures of the 1896 election, including the retiring incumbent Grover Cleveland, the winning candidate William McKinley, and McKinley's innovative campaign manager Mark Hanna.

It organizes a variety of association football leagues, Israel State Cup, and the Israel national football team. The IFA was founded in 1928 as the Palestine Football Association and is based in Ramat Gan. The Association is controversial due to its inclusion of clubs playing in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. History Old Logo The Palestine Football Association (PFA) or Eretz Israel Football Association, was founded in a meeting held on 14 August 1928,An Establishment Meeting for a E.I. Sportive Association Do'ar HaYom, 5 August 1928, Historical Jewish Press In the World of Sport Davar, 31 August 1928, Historical Jewish Press and applied for membership of FIFA. It was admitted provisionally on 17 December 1928, affiliated on 17 May 1929 and recognised by FIFA's government on 6 July 1929. The PFA changed its name to the Israel Football Association (IFA) following the founding of the state of Israel in 1948. The IFA was a member of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) from 1954 until 1974, when it was expelled due to political pressure from Arab and Muslim members that refused to play against Israel. From then until 1992, the IFA was not affiliated with any confederation. During this period, the Israeli national teams played only in FIFA competitions and occasionally in OFC, UEFA and CONMEBOL qualifying tournaments. In 1992, the IFA was admitted to UEFA as an associate member, becoming a full member two years later. Since 1992, Israeli clubs have played in the various UEFA club competitions, while the national teams have played in UEFA championships. Controversy As of 2017, the IFA included six member clubs playing in Israeli settlements in the West Bank. These are Maccabi Ariel indoor football club and Ariel municipal football club in Ariel; Beitar Givat Ze‚Äôev Shabi in Giv'at Ze'ev, a settlement near Ramallah; Beitar Ma‚Äôaleh Adomim in Ma'ale Adumim, a settlement near East Jerusalem; Hapo‚Äôel Oranit in Oranit; and Hapo‚Äôel Jordan Valley in Tomer, a settlement built on land seized from the Palestinian village of Fasayil.Fasayil Village Profile p. 17, ARIJ A seventh club, Hapo‚Äôel Katamon Yerushalayim, plays some home games in the settlement of Ma'ale Adumim while two other clubs playing in Israel list offices in settlements near Hebron and Ramallah. Sari Bashi, Israel and Palestine advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, argues that the IFA is in violation of FIFA rules forbidding a club of one national association from playing in the territory of another as the West Bank is covered by the Palestinian Football Association, a FIFA member. Bashi also notes that Palestinians are not allowed to enter settlements to watch games played by these clubs. German sportswear company Adidas previously sponsored the IFA, leading to criticism for supporting settlement clubs. More than 130 Palestinian sports clubs signed an open letter calling for Adidas to end its sponsorship of the IFA. An online petition of the BDS Movement to \\"Tell Adidas to end sponsorship of Israeli settlement teams\\" reportedly received more than 16,000 signatures. In June 2018, a Dutch BDS group delivered the open letter and petition to an Adidas office in Amsterdam. In July 2018, Adidas ended its sponsorship deal but was replaced as sponsor by Puma, another German sportswear company. As a result, Puma has become a BDS target with critics arguing that Puma, the IFA's only international sponsor, \\"is involved in violations of international law and human rights.\\" Aya Khattab, a player on the Palestinian National Women's football team, argued that \\"Puma's sponsorship of the IFA, and the international legitimacy that it grants, signal to Israel's racist far-right regime that its expansion of illegal settlements by pushing Palestinian families off their ancestral lands can continue with impunity.\\" Mahmoud Sarsak, a Palestinian football player who was imprisoned by Israel for several years without charge or trial, accused Puma of \\"supporting the hate which is destroying lives and poisoning the beautiful game\\" of football. In addition to Khattab and Sarsak, more than 200 Palestinian athletes and sports clubs have called for a Puma boycott, according to articles in the Electronic Intifada and Mondoweiss. In October 2019, posters calling for a boycott of Puma appeared on trains in London. The posters were removed by Transport for London, which described them as an unauthorized act of vandalism. In 2020, Universiti Teknologi MARA, the largest university in Malaysia, ended a sponsorship deal with Puma for their football team due to Puma's IFA sponsorship. StandWithUs, a Israel advocacy group in the US, criticized calls for a boycott stating that \\"Sports are supposed to unite and bring people together, BDS drives them apart.\\" Awards and recognition In 1979, Yosef Yekutieli, the founder of the IFA, was awarded the Israel Prize \\"for dedicating his life to promoting and laying the international foundation of Israeli sports.\\"Sport, Politics and Society in Israel: The First Fifty-five Years See also *List of football stadiums in Israel *Sport in Israel References External links Israel at FIFA site * Israel at UEFA site Israel Category:Football in Israel Category:Futsal in Israel Football Category:Sports organizations established in 1928 Category:1928 establishments in Mandatory Palestine ","title":"Israel Football Association"},{"id":"1265531","text":"A map of Ennerdale Water from 1948 Ennerdale Water is the most westerly lake in the Lake District National Park in Cumbria, England. It is a glacial lake, with a maximum depth of 150 feet (45 metres), and is ¬Ω mile to a mile (700 to 1,500 metres) wide and 2¬Ω miles (3.9 kilometres) long. The lake lies in the eponymous valley of Ennerdale, surrounded by some of the highest and best- known fells in Cumbria including: Great Gable (899 m), Green Gable, Brandreth, High Crag, Steeple and Pillar. To the west of the lake lies the hamlet of Ennerdale Bridge, consisting of two pubs and a few houses. It is close to the port of Whitehaven. Etymology \\" 'Anund's valley'. The name Ennerdale seems originally to have derived from 'Anundar', genitive sing.[ular] of the ON personal name 'Anundr'/'Qnundr', and ON 'dalr' 'valley', but there has been cross-influence between this p.n. and 'Ehen', the name of the river which flows through the valley.\\" (ON is Old Norse.) The lake has been referred to in guidebooks and maps variously as \\"Brodewater\\" (1576), \\"Brodwater\\" (1695), \\"Broad Water\\" (1760), \\"Ennerdale Water\\" (1784) and \\"Ennerdale Lake\\" in Otley's Guide (1823). It is now the Ordnance Survey convention to name it \\"Ennerdale Water\\".  Geography  Ennerdale Water is fed by the River Liza and other streams, and in turn feeds the River Ehen, which runs to the Irish Sea. =Water abstraction= Although the lake is natural, in 1902 a shallow weir was added to what is probably a glacial moraine to maintain the level. The lake is owned by United Utilities, which abstracts water to serve customers in the Whitehaven area. In 2013, United Utilities was informed by the Environment Agency that the abstraction licence was being revoked to protect the environment of Ennerdale and the River Ehen. This meant that United Utilities had to find an alternative water source for customers in West Cumbria. After public consultation, a preferred option to provide water to West Cumbria via a new pipeline from Thirlmere was selected. After a public inquiry in 2014, the independent Planning Inspectors report ruled that the Thirlmere transfer was the right solution and that abstraction from Ennerdale Water would cease by 2022. The construction of the pipeline commenced in 2017. At the same time, United Utilities started to blend water from Ennerdale Water with groundwater from boreholes near Egremont.  Environmental protection measures  Ennerdale has been designated a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Species of interest include the Arctic char. The site contains a variety of habitats apart from the open water of the lake itself.  Tourism  Despite being sited on Wainwright's coast-to-coast walk, the valley is not much visited by tourists. Due to the remote location, the lack of a public road up the valley, and its management by the Forestry Commission, the National Trust and United Utilities, Ennerdale Water has not been as spoiled as other lakes in the National Park by construction, activity on the lake or the effects of tourism. Notable facts Though the Lake District is a popular UK location for film shoots, Ennerdale has been left relatively in the shadow, with only a few brief exceptions. The closing sequences of the film 28 Days Later (2002), directed by Danny Boyle, were filmed around the Ennerdale area, and include a sweeping, panoramic view of the lake. In 1810 a large carnivore killed hundreds of sheep in and around Ennerdale before it was hunted down and killed. The locals dubbed it the Girt (dialect: \\"great\\") Dog of Ennerdale, though it was said to have had the traits of both a dog and a large cat. Once a year, during the last week in August, the Ennerdale Show brings local people together with agricultural displays, competitions, arts and crafts. Former US President Bill Clinton first proposed to his wife Hillary on the banks of Ennerdale Water in 1973.

The company was established in 1898 and is currently Australian owned and manufactures its products in Australia. The trademark of Driza-Bone was first registered in 1933. This style of coat originated in Australia as workwear for stockmen. Not traditionally considered desk-wear, the coats were developed to protect horse riders from the rain and feature straps that hold the coat to the rider's leg. History In the late 1800s, a Scot named Edward Le Roy emigrated to New Zealand. He was able to manufacture oilskin rainwear for use by sailors on sailing ships in the local waters at the time. The garments were originally constructed from the lightweight sails of the sailing ships. The waterproofing of the clothing was by application of linseed oil to the cotton. T. E. Pearson, the son of E. J. Pearson who started Pearson Soap in Hamilton, New Zealand, took a consignment of Leroy Coats to Australia. Stockmen at the time had gathered news of this garment from sailors who had subsequently left sailing to work on the land. Because the garments were flammable around campfires, T. E. Pearson worked on developing a new formula for sealing the coats. He did this in the backyard shed of his home in Kangaroo Street, Manly. Pearson subsequently, in partnership with Leroy, registered the trademark. T.E. died in 1964 and is buried in Frenchs Forest, New South Wales. Over time, changes were made to the original design in the order of: #longer coat for horse riding #fantail in the back of the coat to cover the saddle #wrist straps to secure the sleeves and stop the arms from getting cold #leg straps to stop the coat from flapping around As time went by, the linseed oil (while proving satisfactory for waterproofing) went hard and cracked in the hot summers. Le Roy and T.E. Pearson (of Pearson's Sandsoap fame) came up with a new proofing technique. This new proofing technique has remained unchanged to the present day. In late 2008, the brand was brought back into Australian ownership for the first time in many decades. The acquisition brought with it several influential industry figures, including Steve Bennett (founder of Country Road). This resulted in the immediate relocation of both the Eagleby, QLD head office and primary warehousing facilities to Melbourne, VIC. Major appearances =2000 Olympic Games= Driza-Bone riding coats were worn by the stockmen and stockwomen at the Opening Ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. Also, the 2000 Olympic Band members wore Driza-Bone coats specially made for them as band musicians, in which the sleeves were made completely differently from the sleeves of the traditional Driza-Bone riding coats worn by the riders. The red, white and blue colours of the Driza-Bone coats for the band members were also different from the usual colour of the Driza-Bone coats. Also, all the medal presenters during the 2000 Summer Olympic Games wore Driza-Bone coats.The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular -- Theatre Programme =Stage musical= Driza-Bone coats were also worn by the cast members of the 2002 theatre musical \\"The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular\\".The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular -- Theatre Programme and DVD credits These were designed by the bush/rural clothing enthusiast and designer, Robert Peron, who is a major figure in attempting to have the Driza-Bone accepted as a true fashion item far beyond its status as an Australian icon -- Driza-Bones not having entered the fashion lexicon as yet. =APEC Australia 2007= The APEC leaders pose for the official portrait in front of the Sydney Opera House Driza-Bone coats made an appearance at the 2007 APEC Summit in Sydney.

In 2011, Appointed Commissioner of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Board (2011-2012), set up to protects the legal rights of agricultural workers. State legislature In the State Assembly, Migden served for five years as Chairwoman of the Assembly Committee on Appropriations. She was the first woman and the first lesbian to chair that committee. She also served for four years as a conferee on the state's Joint Budget Conference Committee, which writes the final version of California's state budget. As a member of the State Assembly, Migden authored legislation to create California's domestic partner registry, promote children's health, preserve the old growth Headwaters Forest, increase accountability in K‚Äì12 schools, protect borrowers from predatory and deceptive lending practices, protect consumers from manipulation by energy generators, and promote the use of emergency contraception.Senator Carole Migden ‚Äì Senator Migden Carole Migden Leading: Carole's Issues In 1998, Migden authored the '‚ÄòSafe Needles Act'‚Äô (AB1208 - 1998) that became a national model for legislation that President Clinton signed into law in 2000. Prior to this bill being passed, needles injured 100,000 health care workers a year. Migden authored the '‚ÄòClean Water Act'‚Äô in 1999 that imposed tougher penalties on industrial polluters dumping harmful toxins in California waterways. She also authored the Headwaters Forest and SF Wetlands/Cargill legislation that enabled the state preservation of the ancient Headwaters Forest and restoration of the San Francisco Baylands into a wildlife habitat and recovery of endangered species. Over the last seven years Migden has authored legislation for domestic partnership in California providing benefits to the LGBT community and unmarried senior citizens.

Marin In the fall of 2007 Migden helped resolve a five-year- standoff between Marin County and the state of California regarding property taxes taken by the State and diverted to fund education deficits. With rising property tax values, the state decided to withhold an additional $4 million of county generated tax revenues to pay for programs for troubled children throughout California. Marin officials claimed the state was forcing the county to shoulder an unfair degree of state oriented funding. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed two bills pushed forward by Migden to resolve the issue. Migden's third bill passed and resulted in cutting the amount of surplus funds the county will annually pay to the state by half. The bill resulted in an extra $1.9 million a year for Marin County and a total return of $24.7 million to the area.  Personal life  Migden was born August 14, 1948, in New York City.

That marriage was later annulled by the California Supreme Court. =Leukemia= On May 23, 2007, Migden announced that she was diagnosed with leukemia in 1997 (about a year into her first Assembly term). She was only expected to live 3‚Äì5 years after her diagnosis. Migden underwent rigorous and difficult chemotherapies for two years before finally becoming a participant in clinical trial, which ultimately got FDA approval for Gleevec,Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) ‚Äì National Cancer Institute which has proven to be a watershed cancer drug. She has been in complete remission for many years. Migden's legislative activity persisted, uninterrupted, during the time she was undergoing treatment, continuing to enact legislation including the Clean Water Act, the first Domestic Partnership bill, HMO Health Care Reform, and many others. = Driving history= In 1996, Migden ran a stop sign by the State Capitol and crashed into a 1990 Dodge Spirit sedan owned by Teresa Latham. The crash injured Latham and destroyed Latham's car. Latham claimed that Migden did not \\"seem concerned at all about the situation.\\"How's Carole Migden's Driving?: An 11-Year Grudge Migden accepted full responsibility for the accident and refutes the claim that she was not concerned about Latham or her car. On May 18, 2007, Migden crashed her SUV into a sedan which was stopped at a red light, injuring Ellen Butawan and her 3-year-old daughter, who were sent to the emergency room. Migden claims that she may have suffered from an adverse response to her leukemia treatment that led her to drive erratically.SFist: Carole Migden's Health Revelations 911 tapes released in August show other drivers who saw her during her 30-mile trip along I-80 were panicking as they reported seeing her hit the center divider, and repeatedly come close to hitting other cars, before finally hitting one.SignOnSanDiego.com > News > State ‚Äì 911 tapes show California senator sent other drivers into panic One motorist claimed Migden told her, \\"You can't talk to me like that.

In May 2007, Migden said \\"I owe an explanation to the public and myself and, in particular, the person I hurt.\\" On August 10, 2007, Migden entered a nolo contendere (no contest) plea to charges of reckless driving, paid a $710 fine and was sentenced to two years of probation.Migden pleads no contest to reckless driving Awards Carole Migden at the 1993 March on Washington for Gay Rights In 1998 Migden was named \\"Rookie of the year\\" award by the California Journal, giving her top honors in the categories of integrity, intelligence, hardest working and most influential. In 1999, Migden received \\"Legislator of the Year\\" honors from the California School Employees Association. and the National Center for Lesbian Rights' \\"Lesbian Leadership Award\\".

Election 2008 Seeking a second term in the state senate, Migden failed to win renomination in the 2008 primary election held on 2008-06-03. She finished second in a three-way race. Assemblyman Mark Leno won the nomination, while Migden finished slightly ahead of former Assemblyman Joe Nation from El Verano.Election Night Results ‚Äì CA Secretary of State She was the first legislator to lose a renomination since Assemblyman Brian Setencich lost his primary race in 1996. The election was won by Democrat Mark Leno. The race was one of the costliest legislative races in the state. Migden came into the race with $647,000 in the bank from past races, but according to the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC), she did not properly transfer campaign funds. The FPPC investigators found 89 violations in campaign finance reporting. The FPPC originally prevented her from using the $647,000 from previous races. On March 6, Migden filed a legal challenge against the FPPC, claiming the FPPC ruling had violated her right to free speech. The FPPC settled the dispute with Migden for a record $350,000 fine. Richie Ross, Migden's campaign consultant, called the issues in the complaint legitimate, saying, \\"There's no excuse, and she will have to take her legitimate lumps. I know it, and she knows it.\\" Democratic delegates at the state party convention in March 2008 voted not to endorse Migden 742‚Äì298.

Vowels: * The \\"majhul\\" vowels ƒì / ƒ´ and ≈ç / ≈´ are still kept separate, whereas in western Persian they are merged as ƒ´ and ≈´ respectively. For instance, the identically written words ÿ¥€åÿ± 'lion' and 'milk' are in western Persian both pronounced [≈°ƒ´r], but in Aimaq [≈°ƒìr] for 'lion' and [≈°ƒ´r] for 'milk'. The long vowel in ÿ≤ŸàÿØ 'quick' and ÿ≤Ÿàÿ± 'strong' is realized as [≈´] in western Persian, in contrast, these words are pronounced as [z≈´d] and [z≈çr] respectively by Aimaq speakers. * The diphthongs of early Classical Persian aw (as ow in Engl. cow) and ay (as i in English ice) have in Aimaq become (as in Engl. low) and (as in Engl. day). Dari, on the other hand, is more archaic, e.g. ŸÜŸàÿ±Ÿàÿ≤ 'Persian New Year' is realized as in Iranian, and in Aimaq, and ŸÜÿÆ€åÿ± 'no' is uttered as in Iranian, and as in Aimaq. * The high short vowels [i] and [u] tend to be lowered in western Persian to [e] and [o]. * and are in Aimaq kept separate in word-final positions, unlike western Persian, where has as a word- final allophone. Consonants: * Aimaq still retains the (classical) bilabial pronunciation of the labial consonant Ÿà, which is realized as a voiced labiodental fricative in western Persian. is found in Aimaq as an allophone of f before voiced consonants. * The voiced uvular stop (ŸÇ) and voiced velar fricative (ÿ∫) are still kept separate in Aimaq.

The VBG procedure involves using a band and staples to create a small stomach pouch. In the bottom of the pouch is an approximate one-centimeter hole through which the pouch contents can flow into the remainder of the stomach and hence onto the remainder of the gastrointestinal tract. Stomach stapling is a restrictive technique for managing obesity. The pouch limits the amount of food a patient can eat at one time and slows passage of the food. Stomach stapling is more effective when combined with a malabsorptive technique, in which part of the digestive tract is bypassed, reducing the absorption of calories and nutrients. Combined restrictive and malabsorptive techniques are called gastric bypass techniques, of which Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RGB) is the most common. In this technique, staples are used to form a pouch that is connected to the small intestine, bypassing the lower stomach, the duodenum, and the first portion of the jejunum. This type of weight loss surgery is losing favor as more doctors begin using the adjustable gastric band. The newer adjustable band does not require cutting into the stomach and does not use any staple lines, thus making it a much safer alternative.  Advantages and disadvantages = Advantages= *No dumping syndrome. *No nutritional deficiencies/malabsorption. = Disadvantages= *Needs strict patient compliance to diet. *High fiber foods and foods with a more dense, natural consistency can become very difficult to eat, while highly refined foods cause little discomfort. Many people who regain any weight lost after surgery do so because they begin to avoid the discomfort associated with consuming \\"healthier\\" foods, and start eating more easily passed \\"junk\\" foods. *VBG is in no way a magic bullet or pill. It must be emphasized that lifestyle changes, e.g., diet and exercise, are absolutely imperative for weight loss to occur and be maintained. Realistic expectations are imperative. *Reversal of a VBG requires a much more complex and intensive surgical process than getting the VBG. When removal of a polyurethane band is involved (polyurethane was predominantly used in the 1980s and 90s), it likely has built substantial scar tissue that must also be removed, depending on how long ago the VBG took place. Removal of the staples involves stitching the previously separated parts of the stomach back together. For these reasons, a reversal should only be considered if there are serious medical complications. *Vomiting and severe discomfort if food is not properly chewed or if food is eaten too quickly. *Not adjustable (as with the adjustable gastric band, aka \\"lap band\\")). = Alternatives= *Duodenal switch surgery *Vertical sleeve gastrectomy *Roux- en-Y gastric bypass *Selective vagotomy (snipping the vagus nerve, effectively stopping hunger sensations). *Mini gastric bypass Long term Although restrictive operations lead to weight loss in almost all patients, they are less successful than malabsorptive operations in achieving substantial, long- term weight loss. About 30% of those who undergo VBG achieve normal weight, and about 80% achieve some degree of weight loss. Most studies have suggested that 10 years after surgery, only 10% of patients maintain a minimum weight loss of at least 50% of their total excess weight at the time of their initial surgery. Some patients regain weight. Others are unable to adjust their eating habits and fail to lose the desired weight. Successful results depend on the patient‚Äôs willingness to adopt a long-term plan of healthy eating and regular physical activity. According to an episode of Oprah Winfrey that aired on October 24, 2006, 30% of people who undergo weight loss surgery such as VBG or gastric bypass suffer from addiction transference, which is transferring the previous addiction to food with a new addiction to alcoholism. The show stressed the importance of examining the root causes of addiction in order to avoid the phenomenon. Complications * Staple-line disruption * Stomal fibrosis * Gastroesophageal reflux disease * Incisional ventral hernia History Vertical banded gastroplasty was developed in 2000 by Dr. Edward E. Mason at the University of Iowa. Dr. Mason also developed the original gastric bypass for weight reduction in 1966 and is known for his pioneering work as the \\"father of obesity surgery\\".

She is best known as the lead singer of Madredeus from 1987 until 2007. She also participated as lead actress in feature film by Wim Wenders, Lisbon Story. In parallel with the group's activity, Teresa releases the album Obrigado (2006) ‚Äî a collaboration with various artists such as Jos√© Carreras, Caetano Veloso, Angelo Branduardi amongst others. In 2007, she recorded two albums in partnership with the Septet Jo√£o Cristal (Voc√™ e Eu) and the Lusit√¢nia Ensemble (La Serena), that explores diverse musical universes demonstrating her versatility as an interpreter. She maintained, with these two projects and for two years, a regular program of concerts in Europe, Brazil and Mexico. Also in 2007, by invitation of the Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner, she participates as the lead soloist voice on the album Silence Night and Dreams. With this concert, which had its debut at the Acropolis in Athens, she took the stage in several European cities like Paris, London or P≈Çock. On June 30, 2007, Teresa Salgueiro performed at the Teatro S. Carlo in Naples, by invitation of the Solis String Quartet, playing a set of songs reminiscent of the legacy of Neapolitan music. Two years later, in 2010, the Concert \\"Canti Naviganti\\" was created and premiered in selected cities of Italy. Already as an independent artist, in August 2008, with the idea of gathering a repertoire that would portray the different Portuguese eras, traditions, customs and regions, Teresa meets again with the Lusit√¢nia Ensemble and from this was born the album Matriz, whose concerts were presented in Europe and Africa. Voltarei √† Minha Terra was a journey through the collective memory of Portuguese music from the 20th century. With a new lineup, much closer to her sensitivity, Teresa Salgueiro took over the direction of the musical arrangements, drawing an original language that reflects a poetic universe, born of Portuguese words and feelings. This 25-years journey of uninterrupted dedication to music now culminates in the creation of original pieces that were born from the encounter of Salgueiro with the musicians she has chosen. And for the first time, besides composing the songs, she took upon herself the task of writing all the lyrics. Over nine months, from November 2010 to July 2011, she developed the concepts and ideas crystallized into musical forms and invited Ant√≥nio Pinheiro da Silva, with whom she shared the first ten years of recordings and concerts of her career, to co-produce this new album. Throughout August 2011, she retired to the Convent of Arr√°bida with her musicians and, in the surroundings of the mountain, set up a recording studio where they record the seventeen tracks that give birth to the album O Mist√©rio.

It is the first of a trilogy, with sequels Edenborn and Everfree. The story is split between two settings: the middle of the 21st century (told through interludes and distinguished from the main story by italics) and a generation later. It is a picture of the last ten people on earth, a near-complete pantheon of gods and goddesses. Interludes The story told in the interludes is set in the middle of the 21st century. Here, a retrovirus called Black Ep has rendered all of humanity infertile, and causes people to die. It went undetected by hiding in the human genome itself. Humanity, realizing that the end of the world is imminent, promptly unites in a show of universal brotherhood, but they are too late. However, in the lab of a major German-American genetic research facility, a group of scientists (referred to throughout the interludes as The Southern Gentleman, Blue, and Halfway Jim) are working on a project which may save humanity. The project involves raising ten genetically altered children in immersive virtual reality (IVR), since nobody would be left to raise them. To test the efficiency of the software, Halfway Jim uses his masterpiece work, a program designed to be as close to a real child as possible, to run through the virtual lives the children will lead. Out of sentimentality, Jim's dying act is to integrate this program, which he names Malachi, into the virtual reality environment. Plot A young man wakes up with no memory of who he is, where he is, or anything about his life and is initially unable to move. After a short period of time, he regains motion, but no memories. Over the next few pages, he is faced with flashing lights, disembodied voices, a cathedral, teddy bears nailed to wooden posts, graveyards, the realization that he is both alone and that his world is impossibly small, and terrifying creatures known as Nightgaunts, before meeting with Jasmine, a 'human' who identifies him as Halloween. As the book progresses, Halloween realizes where he is. He's in a virtual reality school that his parents have sent him to. Upon completion of the school, each student will receive both a scholarship to go through college and a position in a prestigious medical company called Gedaechtnis Corporation (in German, Ged√§chtnis means memory, or ability to recall). The ten students are Mercutio (Adam), Pandora (Naomi), Simone, Isaac, Lazarus, Vashti, Tyler, Champagne (Charlotte), Fantasia (Gina), and Halloween (Gabriel) himself. Fan, Merc, Hal, and Ty are considered the \\"clods\\" while Simone, Isaac, Laz, Vashti, Cham, and Pan are the \\"pets\\". Where pets study and follow all of the rules, clods do the opposite. The digital teacher of the school is named Maestro, but the clods call him Mae$tro (pronounced 'Maeshtro') and do not respect or care for him. Each student is given a digital world that they may edit to their liking; this is where they 'live' while in IVR and where Halloween first finds himself at the beginning of the book. They are also assigned a \\"Nanny,\\" a digital being that can help a student with anything they need help with. For example, when Halloween realizes that Jasmine is not real, he asks Nanny to bring her back to life (she died in a fight against Fantasia), and Nanny does so. Because of Halloween's suspicions that he may have killed Lazarus, he does not confide in anyone for a long period of time. Mercutio asks Halloween if he'd like some food, and they decide to dine at the Taj Mahal. Mercutio begins to order a steak, but halfway through his order, the entire world freezes up. Merc has triggered a jammer so that he and Hal can escape IVR, and they both wake up in their beds in the school. They decided to visit their favorite diner, Twain's, and enjoy a nice meal before Merc decides to head back to IVR. Halloween, however, chooses to call his parents and report that he is dropping out. After a tough time with both his parents and Ellison, the school's headmaster (and the man Maestro was modeled after), Halloween is sent back to IVR. Halloween \\"graduates\\" all of the remaining students, waking them up from IVR. They decide to fulfill Gedaechtnis' plans for them to rebuild the world, but Halloween rejects the plan. The book ends with Halloween standing in the woods of Michigan, angry at the world for robbing him of his illusions, the girl he loved and his two best friends.

To cope with the growing tension around the world, Chiang Kai-shek of the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan, Elpidio Quirino of the Republic of the Philippines, and Syngman Rhee of the Republic of Korea founded the APACL in Jinhae, the wartime capital city of the Republic of Korea (ROK) on 15 June 1954. Its first general conference was held in that city and was host to advocate and support the causes of anti-communism, anti- totalitarianism as well as anti-authoritarianism. The other participating states, including South Vietnam, Thailand, Okinawa, Hong Kong, and Macao, also sent representatives. =World Freedom Day= World Freedom Day (, ) is a memorial day celebrated on 23 January in Taiwan and South Korea. The event marks the return of some 22,000 ex-communist war prisoners of the Korean War (1950-1953) to Taiwan, of whom 14,000 Chinese soldiers arrived at Keelung harbor on 23 January 1954, and were given the title \\"Anti-Communist Martyrs\\".Monique Chu, NGO celebrates World Freedom Day, Taipei Times, 3 February 2002 The Republic of China (ROC) government subsequently declared 23 January as World Freedom Day to honor these soldiers, and created the \\"Anti- Communist League\\" (which later became the World League for Freedom and Democracy) to fight communist expansion worldwide. The league is led by President Yao Eng-Chi, a former Kuomintang-MP and Secretary-General Ger Yeong- Kuang, a Professor for political science at National Taiwan University. Every year World Freedom Day Celebrations are held in Taiwan, and the event is attended by both locals and foreign delegates from all over the world. Usually, the president of the ROC delivers a congratulatory message, and cultural performances take place. =Asian Pacific League for Freedom and Democracy= The Asian Pacific League for Freedom and Democracy (APLFD) was founded in 1954 as the Asian Peoples‚Äô Anti-Communist League in Chinhae, South Korea with the support of the governments of the Philippines, South Korea and Taiwan (as the Republic of China). The APLFD is a non-proft international organization for interchanges among the Asians for peace and prosperity of the region. The APLFD was founded in the same year and under the same international background as the forming of the South East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), or the Manila Pact, did in 1954, when the Second World War was concluded not a long while ago. However, while the SEATO (1954-1977) was sort of an Asian Nato in nature, the APLFD is a people's organization trying to secure peace and prosperity through ideas and convictions and friendship. Having founded the APACL, the government of the Republic of China prepared to organize the second conference and chose Taipei City as the place to set up the Republic of China Chapter of the APACL on 1 July 1954. Ku Cheng- kang, President of the Chinese Refugees Relief Association of the Republic of China, was designated as the first president of this Chapter. Over the years, successors to the presidency of the Republic of China Chapter are Clement C. P. Chang, Chao Tze-chi, Yao Eng-chi, and Tseng Yung-chuan. the president was Yao Eng-chi, former Vice President of the ROC Legislative Yuan (Parliament) and also Senior Advisor to President of the Republic of China on Taiwan. =World Anti-Communist League= In 1966 the memberships of the APACL had increased to 27, in Asia, Australia, and Africa. At its 12th Conference in Seoul on 3 November 1966, a fifteen-member committee was formed to discuss the expansion of this organization. The committee eventually decided to set up a new anti-communist organization, including the APACL, regional organizations, and an international anti-communist organization. On 7 November 1966, the delegates adopted the ‚ÄúCharter of the World Anti-Communist League‚Äù at the plenary session. It also resolved that the Republic of China Chapter was in charge of organizing the first General Conference. The Charter of the World Anti-Communist League (WACL), with 8 chapters and 32 articles, came into effect on 1 April 1967. It stated that the WACL should immediately set up its regional organizations in six regions: Asia (now known as Asian Pacific League for Freedom and Democracy), Middle East (now known as Middle East Solidarity Council), Africa (now known as the African Organization for Freedom and Democracy), and Europe (now known as the European Council for World Freedom), North America (now known as the North American Federation for Freedom and Democracy), and Latin America (now known as the Federation of Latin American Democratic Organization). The organization in the Asian region was the main force to push for the mission of the World League. =Renaming= To adjust to the worldwide political changes after the defeat of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War and to strive for recruiting more people to join, the WACL held its 22nd General Conference in Brussels, Belgium on 23 July 1990, and the delegates resolved that the organization should be renamed the \\"World League for Freedom and Democracy\\" (WLFD). This resolution came into effect on 1 January 1991. On 21 August 1991, with the new name, the WLFD held its 23rd General Conference in San Jose, Costa Rica. Rafael √Ångel Calder√≥n Fournier, President of Costa Rica, and vice presidents from six countries in Latin America, gave speeches. The conference passed a resolution to set up the Presidency of League, a new post to highlight the leading center of the WLFD and also to take the responsibility to organize WLFD activities. Chao Tze-chi, President of the Republic of China Chapter of WLFD, was elected as the first President of the WLFD, and re-elected in 1995. U Chae-sung of the ROK was named as the Secretary-General. On 19 January 2006, the WLFD adopted its charter amendment in the 34th General Conference. According to the Amendment, the President of the League shall be \\"the top official of the League\\" and shall represent the League, and shall supervise the performance and development of the League in compliance with the charter. According to the previous charter of the WLFD, the President of the League shall be \\"the Leader of the League\\" and shall represent the League. This person shall supervise the performance and development of the League in compliance with the charter. According to the Charter of the WLFD, the President of the League shall be elected by and from the members of the Executive Board of the League. The result of the election shall be reported to the General Conference. The President shall hold office for a term of four years and shall be eligible for re-election. In October 2000, all members of the Executive Board approved Yao Eng-chi, President of the WLFD ROC Chapter, as the third President of the League during the Executive Board Meeting in New York City, U.S. The Executive Board also amended the charter to add several positions such as four vice presidents and two deputy secretary-generals. The decision made by the Executive Board was also confirmed by the members at the 31st WLFD General Conference in Taipei, ROC, on 13 January 2001. President Yao Eng-chi was re- elected as President of the League at the 33rd WLFD General Conference in Melbourne, Australia, on 20 December 2003. Ger Yeong-kuang was named as Secretary-General of the League. On 1 August 2008, Ger resigned and was succeeded by Hsieh Wen-huang, Parliamentary Assistant to Vice President Tseng Yung-chuan of the ROC Legislative Yuan (Parliament). Hsieh resigned; Chou Yujen's was nominated to replace him on 23 January 2013. Membership According to the charter, national, regional or international organizations that subscribe to the purposes of the League are eligible for membership. Membership shall consist of Regular Members with voting rights and Associate Members without voting rights. The Asian Pacific League for Freedom and Democracy (APLFD) was formed in 1954 as the Asian Peoples‚Äô Anti-Communist League. The APLFD Secretariat was first established in Saigon, Vietnam in 1957; then the Secretariat moved to Manila in 1964. Three years later, the Secretariat moved back again to Saigon until its fall in 1975. After some compromise and a resolution, the APLFD Secretariat was re-established in Taipei, Taiwan in 1976 where it remains active.Asia in the Pacific Islands: Replacing the West By R. G. Crocombe In 1983, at its conference in Fiji, it changed its name to the Asian Pacific Democratic League. The APLFD has 18 member nations. It holds an annual conference every year. The number of members in Denmark is unknown, but several politicians have or have been connected to the organization. Progress Party leader Pia Kj√¶rsgaard participated in 1988 as WACL's guest at the organization's congress in Taipei.Det fri Aktuelt: 18 September 1988: \\"G√¶st hos fascismen\\" archived at https://www.webcitation.org/6lvK95Vgw?url=http://www.danskfolkeantiparti.dk/hos_fascismen.htm The Danish WACL leader has been municipal politician Erik Dissing. The French chapter was headed by Suzanne Labin. The president of the German section as of 2012 has been Axel Fischer. In Sweden, a department of WACL has been established since 1967. The Swedish organization has been characterized by strong participation among exile Estonians. Among the member organizations in the late 1960s were Democratic Alliance, Baltic Committee, Nordic War and UN Veterans Association and the Committee for a Free Asia. The National League of Sweden was also linked to the organization for some time. Swedish chairman has been Birger Nerman (1967‚Äì70), Arvo Horm (1970-1984), Birger Hag√•rd (1984‚Äì88) and √Öke J. Ek (1988-2011). Controversies In 1978, Roger Pearson became the World Chairman of the WACL. Pearson was described in a Washington Post article as having neo-Nazi associations and sources report that as a result of an article in the Washington Post in 1978 critical of WACL and alleging extreme right wing politics of Pearson that either he was expelled from WACL or at least was pressured into resigning from his position as World Chairman. The U.S. chapter of WACL, the United States Council for World Freedom (USCWF) was founded in 1981 by Major General John K. Singlaub. Singlaub was the former US Chief of Staff of both United Nations and American forces in South Korea, but was relieved in 1977 by U.S. President Jimmy Carter after publicly criticizing Carter's decision to reduce the number of troops on the peninsula. Singlaub became a member of the WACL in 1980, and founded and became president of its U.S. chapter, the United States Council for World Freedom. This branch generated controversy when it supported Nicaraguan guerrillas in the Iran‚ÄìContra affair and, in 1981, the USCWF was placed under watch by the Anti- Defamation League, which said that the organization had increasingly become \\"a point of contact for extremists, racists, and anti-Semites\\".Anti-Semitism Charges Lead To Delay on Religion Prize, New York Times, April 19, 1988.Anti- Defamation League (1981), \\" Terrorism‚Äôs Targets: Democracy, Israel and Jews\\", p23 - cited at ADL on the WACL & John McCain During the 1980s, the USCWF and WACL conducted a purge of these elements, and invited ADL observers to monitor its conferences;Singlaub, Hazardous Duty, p. 447 by 1985, the Anti-Defamation League declared itself \\"satisfied that substantial progress has been made since 1981 in ridding the organization of racists and anti-Semites.\\" It is alleged that in the mid-1980s WACL had become a supplier of arms to anti- communist rebel movements in southern Africa, Central America, Afghanistan and the Far East.David Pallister, David Beresford and Angela Johnson. \\"Guns, Goons, and Western Goals\\", The Guardian, April 24, 1993. During the 1980s, the WACL was particularly active in Latin America, notably by aiding the Contra forces in Nicaragua.. During this period, WACL was criticized for the presence in the organization of neo-Nazis, war criminals, and people linked to death squads and assassinations. Other allegations have included reports claim that the World League for Freedom and Democracy is responsible for producing what its opponents call \\"troops of killers\\", while ostensibly organizing to provide support for Corazon Aquino from the right-wing in the PhilippinesThe Village Voice, February 27, 1996 and for supporting the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) movement in Mozambique.. The World Anti-Communist League held annual conferences at various locations throughout the world. Numerous groups participated, including the Unification Church of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon. WACL also enjoyed support from many U.S. Congressmen, most notably 2008 presidential nominee Senator John McCain (R-AZ), who sat on the United States Council for World Freedom (USCWF) Board of Directors in the early 1980s.. McCain has said previously he resigned from the council in 1984 and asked in 1986 to have his name removed from the group's letterhead but there was absolutely no evidence that McCain had ever resigned or asked for his name's removal from the United States Council for World Freedom. =Controversial members= In the World Anti-Communist League, numerous Nazi collaborators and Latin American death squads were active.

Yarnell (DLG/CG-17) was a Leahy-class guided missile cruiser of the United States Navy. Named in honor of Admiral Harry E. Yarnell (1875‚Äì1959), she was originally classified as a \\"destroyer leader\\" or frigate, in 1975 she was redesignated a cruiser in the Navy's ship reclassification. She was the second of the \\"double-end\\" Leahy-class guided missile frigates to join the fleet. Construction Harry E. Yarnell was launched 9 December 1961 by the Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine; sponsored by Mrs. Philip Yarnell, widow of Admiral Yarnell; and commissioned 2 February 1963 at the Boston Naval Shipyard, Captain Charles E. Nelson in command. History Harry E. Yarnell was equipped with RIM-2 Terrier surface-to-air missile launching rails both fore and aft and ASROC anti-submarine missiles, as well as more conventional torpedo tubes and guns. The new ship was fitted out at Boston and began sea trials. While out on trials, Yarnell was diverted on 10 April 1963 to search for USS Thresher (SSN-593), the nuclear submarine later found on the bottom some 8,000 feet down. Quartering the area where the sub was last reported, the guided missile frigate found an oil slick and some debris but could not contact the lost submarine. On her way to her new home base, Naval Station Norfolk, on 23 April, Harry E. Yarnell passed and photographed several Soviet \\"merchant\\" ships. The next few months were spent conducting training for shakedown and missile qualification. Designated to carry out standardization trials for her class as well as special acoustical tests, Yarnell spent 28 October‚Äì26 November in the Caribbean operating out of Guantanamo Bay and then returned to Norfolk. Yarnell continued operating in the Virginia Capes area and the Caribbean until departing from Norfolk on 8 September 1964 for her first Atlantic crossing. NATO ASW exercises en route took the guided missile frigate far north, and she crossed the Arctic circle on 21 September. She visited Amsterdam en route to the Mediterranean, where she remained until returning to Norfolk in February 1965. On her next Mediterranean deployment, which began 8 October, she transited the Dardanelles on 3 January 1966 and entered the Black Sea to operate close to the Soviet Union before returning to Norfolk in March. After NATO exercises in the North Atlantic, Harry E. Yarnell received the battle efficiency \\"E\\" for the preceding year. She also won the 1966 Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Atlantic Fleet. Operations in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean brought the ship and her crew to a high degree of readiness before she sailed for her 3rd Mediterranean deployment early in 1967. She cruised the Mediterranean until returning to Norfolk in May. At mid-year she operated in the North Atlantic. After the upgrade in Bath, Maine, in 1969, the Yarnell made her way to Boston Naval Shipyard. The Yarnell was given a new crew and recommissioned for service in Boston. The Yarnell was then assigned to Naval Station Newport. A year of testing all the new systems and the Yarnell set sail in July, 1970 on a UNITAS cruise for exercises with the naval forces of South American countries. Following departure from Newport and an overnight visit at Dam Neck, VA, Yarnell sailed to San Juan, Puerto Rico to pick up the admiral for the cruise. The Yarnell visited Caracas, Venezuela; and Salvador, Rio de Janeiro (twice) and S√£o Paulo, Brazil. A scheduled visit to Montevideo, Uruguay was cancelled due to political activity there, so Yarnell returned to Rio de Janeiro for a second visit. Following a stop in Comodoro Rivadavia, Argentina to take on supplies, Yarnell proceeded through the Magellan Straits and the Chilean Waterway into the Pacific Ocean, where stops were made in Chile, Peru, Ecuador, and Panama before going through the Panama Canal and returning to Newport via San Juan and St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. In late 1972, the Yarnell was again deployed to the Mediterranean. On the way across the Atlantic a helicopter from a Russian cruiser flew around the Yarnell taking many photographs. The Yarnell was ordered to accompany the Russia submarines from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Black Sea. Yarnell made port visits at Naples, Genoa, and Venice, Italy; Nice, France; Mallorca, Valencia and Barcelona, Spain; and Athens, Corfu, Rhodes, and Kavalla; Greece. USS Harry E. Yarnell in 1990. Yarnell returned to the Mediterranean in August 1973. En route she visited Lisbon, Portugal, then took part in Exercise Quickshave off the coasts of France, England and Portugal, followed by turnover in Rota with the . Yarnell then deployed to La Palma, followed by Western Med operations as a picket with a short return afterward, to Palma. Group Operations off Crete along with an ORE, were followed by a trip to Athens. Further visits to Barcelona and Malaga occurred before turnover in Rota to on 14 January, Yarnell returning to Newport on 24 January 1974. After a short period of local operations, the Yarnell entered Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a one-year overhaul. Completion of overhaul also included a trip to New York, during which time she briefly ran aground, before ammunition load-out at Naval Weapons Station Earle, and a Home Port change to Norfolk. Refresher Training at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, with a visit over 4 July to Port-au- Prince, Haiti, followed by local operations off Virginia. The entire Leahy class was given an AAW upgrade during the late-1970s and early 1980s. The 3/50s were replaced by 8 RGM-84 Harpoon missiles, the Terrier launchers were upgraded to fire the Standard missile, and 2 Phalanx CIWS were added. All were upgraded under the late-1980s NTU program. This included new radars, a new combat system, new fire control systems, and upgraded missiles and missile launchers. On 19 November 1980 Yarnell, under the command of Captain Howard F. Burdick Jr, sailed with the and her battle group to the Arabian Sea/Indian Ocean, during which the ship made port calls at Mombasa, Kenya and Perth and Fremantle, Australia from 3-7 February 1981. The Yarnell returned home to Norfolk Naval Base, VA, on 10 June 1981. In late June 1990, Rear Admiral Thomas D. Paulson, Commander Cruiser-Destroyer Group Two, led the Yarnell and to visit Poland in conjunction with BALTOPS '90, a U.S. Naval Forces Europe- hosted international naval exercise in the Baltic Sea. Their port call at Gdynia was the first visit by United States Navy vessels to Poland since 1927. Fate Harry E. Yarnell was decommissioned on 20 October 1993, and stricken on 29 October 1993. She was sold on 14 April 1995 for scrapping at Quonset Point, Rhode Island, but the scrap contract was terminated on 1 December 1996 (scrapping 10% complete), and the hulk returned to Philadelphia for storage. Scrapping was ultimately completed in April 2002.  References   External links  *navsource.org: USS Harry E.

Overview  Temperley was born in Cambridge, the son of Ernest Temperley, a Fellow and Bursar of Queens' College, Cambridge. He was educated at Sherborne School and King's College, Cambridge, where he obtained a First in History. He became a lecturer at the University of Leeds in 1903, before taking a fellowship at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1905. Temperley's field was modern diplomatic history, and he was heavily involved as editor in the publication of the British Government's official version of the diplomatic history of the early twentieth century. He also wrote on George Canning and Eastern European history. During World War I, Temperley was commissioned into the Fife and Forfar Yeomanry, missing the Gallipoli landings due to illness. He was then seconded to the War Office, working on intelligence and policy in the Balkans. His History of Serbia was published in 1917. He attended the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and later worked on an official history of it, on a scheme devised by George Louis Beer and Lord Eustace Percy. He was British representative on the Albanian boundary commission; and was an advisor in 1921 to Arthur Balfour at the League of Nations. In the compilation of the British Documents on the Origins of the War he collaborated with George Peabody Gooch, (1873‚Äì1968), another diplomatic historian and a member of parliament for the Liberal Party from 1906 to 1910. Gooch had spoken out against British policy in the Second Boer War, and was also a historian of Germany; his appointment was designed to give the project a credible independence. In the event, Temperley and Gooch were constrained financially, and in the use of documents subject to a 'fifty year rule' limitation on their release. To get their own way, they had to employ tactical resignation threats. Lillian Margery Penson (1896‚Äì1963) was involved in both this and a later project on the Blue Books. In 1923 Temperley founded The Cambridge Historical Journal at Cambridge.http://www.history.ac.uk/makinghistory/historians/temperley_harold.html The historian Herbert Butterfield was a student of Temperley. He commented later in life on how the ageing Temperley and Charles Webster, an equally aged historian, dominated the college Combination Room, \\"like booming giants, cumbersome and dangerous to crockery, bulging with warmth and good feeling, yet capable of overbearingness ‚Äì terrible lions if you trod on their tales [sic]\\".

He also served as minister of war of Prussia in the period 1810-1813 and later again from 1 March 1841 ‚Äì 6 October 1847. Life Born in Kreuzburg (today's Slavskoye, Russia) in East Prussia, Boyen joined the army in 1784 in K√∂nigsberg. In 1788, as a newly minted second lieutenant, he took up a post in the military academy in K√∂nigsberg, where he also attended some of the lectures of Immanuel Kant. From 1794-96, Boyen took part in the Polish campaign as Adjutant to General von G√ºnther. In 1799, he became a captain. He served in the war of 1806 on the General Staff of the Duke of Brunswick, and was wounded at the Battle of Auerst√§dt (14 October 1806). After the Treaty of Tilsit (July 1807) he became a major and a member of Gerhard von Scharnhorst's commission for military re-organisation. By 1810 Boyen had become Director of the Military Cabinet. In the re-constitution of the Prussian army he functioned as Scharnhorst's most diligent helper, but after the conclusion of the alliance between Prussia and France in 1812 he resigned his commission as a colonel and visited Vienna and St Petersburg. The events of 1813 saw him recalled to the Prussian service: as a colonel he accompanied the Russian army from its base in Kalisz to Saxony. After the Battle of L√ºtzen (2 May 1813) he had charge of the border guards and ultimately the defence of Berlin. But during the truce King Frederick William III named him Chief of General Staff of the 3rd Army Corps. As such, Boyen participated in the battles and skirmishes of 1813 and 1814 and gained promotion to major-general. After the first Peace of Paris (30 May 1814) Boyen took up his appointment as War Minister. He completed the setting up of the Landwehr reserve (begun during the war) and in 1818 became a lieutenant general. He struggled in vain against growing reactionary forces which endangered the broad popular base of the Landwehr, and resigned in 1819. The tomb of Boyen at the Invalidenfriedhof in Berlin. For 21 years Boyen lived in retirement, occupying himself with historical studies, until King Frederick William IV, immediately after ascending the throne, recalled him to active service, and promoted him to general of the infantry. In March 1841 he once again took over the War Ministry, though without achieving a great influence in the general political situation. He resigned in November 1847, received the rank of field marshal, and died on 15 February 1848. The King named the fortress of L√∂tzen in East Prussia after him. Boyen's son, also named Hermann von Boyen, was General Adjutant to the King. He retired a governor of Berlin in 1879. Hermann von Boyen was buried at the Invalidenfriedhof Cemetery in Berlin. The former football club Yorck Boyen Insterburg was named in honor of Boyen. Works Hermann von Boyen wrote (among other works): * Beitr√§ge zur Kenntnis des Generals v. Scharnhorst (1833) * Erinnerungen aus dem Leben des Generalleutnants v. G√ºnther (1834). *Vorw√§rts!: ein Husaren-Tagebuch und Feldzugsbriefe von Gebhardt Leberecht von Bl√ºcher etc. (1914, diary during his period under the Hussars) *Gesammelte Schriften und Briefe / Bl√ºcher, Yorck, Gneisenau; zusammengestellt und hrsg. von Edmund Th.

The name derives from the Fisk Jubilee Singers, a group of singers organized by George L. White at Fisk University in 1871 to sing Negro spirituals. The members of the original Fisk Jubilee Quartet (1909‚Äì1916) were Alfred G. King (first bass), James A. Myers (second tenor), Noah W. Ryder (second bass), and John W. Work II (first tenor).https://www.npr.org/2011/02/26/134028602/at-fisk-university-a- tradition-of-spirituals Students at other historically black schools, such as Hampton Institute, Tuskegee Institute and Wilberforce University, followed suit. Many independent jubilee troupes also found inspiration in the Fisk Jubilee Singers, such as the Original Nashville Students. The early jubilee quartets featured close harmonies, formal arrangements and a \\"flatfooted\\" style of singing that emphasized restrained musical expression and technique derived from Western musical traditions. Early quartets reinforced their respectable image by adopting uniforms that a university glee club might wear and discouraging improvisation. In time, however, the popularity of the jubilee style spread from the universities to black churches, where quartets, singing before audiences with a tradition of enthusiastic response, began to absorb much of the energy and freedom of Gospel music coming out of Holiness churches. Groups such as the Golden Gate Quartet‚Äîoriginally named the Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet‚Äîinfused their performances of spirituals with the rhythmic beat of blues and jazz and gradually began including gospel standards written by Thomas A. Dorsey and others in their repertoire. The Gates and other jubilee quartets gained nationwide popularity through radio broadcasts, records and touring in the 1930s and 1940s. Other groups, such as the Dixie Hummingbirds and the Original Five Blind Boys of Alabama (formally known as the Happyland Jubilee Singers) that had begun singing in the conventional jubilee style went further, creating the more improvisational and fervent style of quartet singing known as \\"hard Gospel\\". That new style largely eclipsed jubilee singing by the 1950s.

Typically, it is meant to improve traffic flow during rush hours, by having overhead traffic lights and lighted street signs notify drivers which lanes are open or closed to driving or turning. Reversible lanes are also commonly found in tunnels and on bridges, and on the surrounding roadways ‚Äì even where the lanes are not regularly reversed to handle normal changes in traffic flow. The presence of lane controls allows authorities to close or reverse lanes when unusual circumstances (such as construction or a traffic mishap) require use of fewer or more lanes to maintain orderly flow of traffic. Separation of flows Some more recent implementations of reversible lanes use a movable barrier to establish a physical separation between allowed and disallowed lanes of travel. In some systems, a concrete barrier is moved during low-traffic periods to switch a central lane from one side of the road to another; some examples are the five-lane San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge in San Diego, California, the former seven-lane Tappan Zee Bridge on the Hudson River in New York and the eight-lane Auckland Harbour Bridge across the WaitematƒÅ Harbour in Auckland, New Zealand. Other systems use retractable cones or bollards which are built into the road, or retractable fences which can divert traffic from a reversible ramp. The two center lanes of the six-lane Golden Gate Bridge are reversible; they are southbound during morning rush hour and northbound at evening rush hour. Prior to the installation of a movable median barrier in January 2015, they were demarcated by vertical yellow markers placed manually in sockets in the roadway. Many urban freeways have entirely separate carriageways (and connecting ramps) to hold reversible lanes (the reversible lanes in such a configuration are often referred to as \\"express lanes\\"). Generally, traffic flows in one direction or another in such a configuration (or not at all); the carriageways are not \\"split\\" into two-lane roadways during non-rush periods. Typically, this sort of express lane will have fewer interchanges than the primary lanes, and many such roadways only provide onramps for inbound traffic, and offramps for outbound traffic. Passing lanes striping on an old-style suicide lane setup in the United States Historically, the term \\"suicide lane\\" has also referred to a lane in the center of a highway meant for passing in both directions. Neither direction has the right-of-way, and both directions are permitted to use the lane for passing. In a similar layout, three lanes are striped with two in one direction and one in the other, but traffic in the direction with one lane is allowed to cross the centerline to pass. 2+1 roads have replaced some of these, mainly in Europe. Turn lanes and flush medians A turn lane (in New Zealand a \\"flush median\\") with a raised median in the forefront A typical five-lane arterial equipped with a center turn lane. These are often found in cities, towns and developed areas near cities. In the United States, the sequence line is located on the inside of the lane (sometimes with left turn arrows for both flows). In Canada it is the same for all provinces with the exception of Ontario, where the sequence line is located on the outside. Another type of center two-way lane is a \\"two-way left turn lane\\" (TWLT) or \\"center left-turn lane\\", or (for countries that drive on the right) \\"center turn lane\\" or \\"median turn lane\\", a single lane in the center of the road into which traffic from both directions pulls to make a left turn. While this is sometimes also called a \\"suicide lane\\", it is actually far safer, as traffic collisions occur at far lower speeds. These roads are very common in suburban areas and less common in rural areas, though they are frequent around developed areas near Interstate Highway bypasses in the United States. Many were divided highways before the median was demolished or otherwise replaced by the turn lane. Many four-lane streets with a center double yellow line are being phased out in favor of 3- or five-lane streets with center turn lanes because the center lane allows for less disruption of traffic flow.3 lane roads such as this are typically created as part of a \\"road diet,\\" with remainder of the road becoming bicycle lanes. For routes with moderate traffic, other movements involve downgrading four-lane undivided streets to three-lane streets with a turn-only center lane. This center lane can be used by emergency vehicles like police cars, ambulance, and fire trucks to avoid traffic traveling in either direction. Drivers are not allowed to use the center lane of such a highway for passing slow-moving vehicles, except when funding or space constraints dictate use of it as a rush hour \\"travel lane\\" when traffic is largely asymmetric between a central business district and its suburbs. U.S. Route 13 near the Greenville, North Carolina, city limits is a rare instance of a posted warning sign that states \\"do not pass in center lane\\".

Australia * The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Sydney, New South Wales (eight lanes total, three (formerly four) potentially reversible, three reversed daily. Morning peak, six south, two north. Afternoon peak, three south, five north. Other times, four south, four north). * The Spit Bridge, Sydney, New South Wales (4 lanes total. Morning peak 3 south, 1 north. Afternoon peak 3 north, 1 south. All other times 2 north, 2 south). * The Alfords Point Bridge in the south-western suburbs of Sydney, New South Wales. Three lanes total, with the centre lane reversible using manual placement of plastic bollards. Originally this bridge was built with two lanes, and was to be part of twin spans, but only the foundations and excavations for approach works were built for the Eastern span, and the bridge was opened with one lane used in each direction. New approach works commenced in January 2007 for the second span, at a cost of 45 million AUD, eliminating the need for a reversible lane. However, a 300-metre reversible centre lane will still remain on Alfords Point Road over Henry Lawson Drive, approximately 500 meters north of this proposed bridge. * General Holmes Drive generally has four north and four south lanes, but during morning peak hour one southbound lane is divided from the others with a plastic island with signs placed along the top. The island is shifted across by the RTA with a specialized vehicle. This lane is used as a northbound lane for local traffic to get to Botany and Mascot from the St George area. * Flagstaff Road in the southern suburbs of Adelaide, South Australia. Three lanes total, with the centre lane reversible. During the morning peak, northbound (downhill) occupies two lanes, and southbound (uphill) one lane.

Kentucky * The Clay Wade Bailey Bridge in Covington (3 lanes total, 1 reversible) * Nicholasville Road (U.S. Highway 27) in Lexington has reversible lanes (lane signals, no physical separation) starting at its intersection with Conn Terrace at the University of Kentucky campus and ending at New Circle Road, the city's inner beltway. During morning rush hour, as well as the hours before UK football home games, southbound traffic (away from the UK campus and downtown) is restricted to one lane between campus and Southland Drive, and two lanes from Southland to New Circle. Northbound traffic faces the same restrictions in the evening rush hour and immediately after football games. During off-peak hours, an equal number of lanes are dedicated to traffic in each direction. One dedicated left-turn lane is always provided regardless of the current traffic configuration. * Baxter Avenue and Bardstown Road (U.S. Highway 31E) in Louisville have reversible lanes (lane signals without any physical separation) for miles through The Highlands, starting at their intersection with Lexington Road in the north and ending at Douglass Boulevard in the south. This stretch of road has four lanes, but on-street parking frequently restricts traffic to one lane in each direction outside of rush hours. During rush hours, parking is prohibited north of Douglass Boulevard. Southbound traffic leaving downtown Louisville is restricted to one lane during the morning rush hour, with northbound traffic having the same restriction during the evening rush hour. Also, the lane immediately to the left of rush-hour through traffic becomes a dedicated left-turn lane. Electronic signs over the roadway alert motorists to the traffic flow dedication of each lane.

On weekdays the direction is one-way eastbound 7am-9am, and one-way westbound 4pm-6pm. New Jersey * Lincoln Tunnel's center tube (one of three in total) is reversible. In general, both of the lanes, including one \\"XBL\\" (Exclusive Bus Lane), serve Manhattan-bound traffic during the weekday morning rush hour, both of the lanes serve New Jersey-bound traffic during the weekday evening rush hour, and one lane is provided in each direction during other time periods. * Since 1970, the Lincoln Tunnel Approach and Helix in Hudson County supports an \\"XBL\\", or Exclusive Bus Lane, on New Jersey Route 495 during the weekday morning peak period (approximately 6:00 a.m. ‚Äì 10:00 a.m.). Eastbound buses travel in this reversible lane to the approach to the toll plaza at the Lincoln Tunnel, at the other end of which is the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan in New York City. The lane is fed by the New Jersey Turnpike at Exits 16E and 17, and the western terminus of New Jersey Route 3\\\\. Both the tunnel and terminal are owned and operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the bi-state agency that also operates the reversible, express bus lane along the left lane of three westbound lanes. The XBL serves over 1,800 buses, which transport more than 65,000 persons, each morning and is a major component of the morning \\"inbound\\" commutation crossing the Hudson River. Over 100 bus carriers utilize the Exclusive Bus Lane. New Jersey Transit operates numerous interstate bus routes through the Lincoln Tunnel, as do numerous regional and long-distance companies. * The Walt Whitman Bridge, Ben Franklin Bridge and Commodore Barry Bridge over the Delaware River between New Jersey and Pennsylvania use moveable medians, to create zipper lanes.http://www.barriersystemsinc.com/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/c0a0053d6a03f88d12ab6702fd439dc7/files/ben_franklin_bridge_case_study.pdf New York * Delancey Street in Manhattan has two lanes on the eastbound side adjacent to the median used for westbound traffic in the morning rush hour between the Williamsburg Bridge and Allen Street. All traffic in these lanes must continue to and then turn left onto Allen, during these times left turns are prohibited from the regular westbound roadway onto Allen Street. * Manhattan Bridge in New York City has three lanes on the lower level, which can have all lanes used in one direction or reversible with two lanes one way and the other for the opposite direction. * The upper level of the Queensboro Bridge in New York City has four lanes and can have all flowing outbound (PM peak), or two lanes each direction in normal configuration. * The Mid-Hudson Bridge in Poughkeepsie, New York, has a reversible center lane used during rush hour. North Carolina * East 7th Street in Charlotte * U.S. Route 29 in Charlotte ** This road is the access road to Charlotte Motor Speedway from the city, and links to Interstate 485. It is used for any events at the Speedway. Ohio * Butler Street in Sandusky, used to route traffic between U.S. Route 250 and Cleveland Road, features a reversible center lane to facilitate influxes of traffic going to and from Cedar Point. Pennsylvania * The Liberty Bridge near the southern terminus of I-579 in Pittsburgh has 4 lanes, all of which are potentially reversible, and 2 of which are reversed based on rush-hour times. * The West End Bridge in Pittsburgh has 4 lanes, which are all potentially reversible. * West General Robinson Street near Heinz Field in Pittsburgh has 4 lanes, and 2 are reversible. South Carolina * The Silas N. Pearman Bridge, demolished in 2005, originally contained a third reversible lane, leftmost when heading north on US 17. This was converted to a fixed truck lane for southbound traffic shortly after its construction in the 1960s, as an inspection of its companion bridge, the John P. Grace Memorial Bridge, revealed it was no longer strong enough to carry truck traffic. Both bridges would eventually be rendered obsolete and replaced by the Ravenel Bridge. Tennessee * U.S. Route 70 in Nashville has three reversible lanes (lane signals, Traffic Lights, without any physical separation) from Korean Veterans Blvd. to just east of a Railroad crossing, there is a break in the reversible lanes between Willow St. and Lindsley Ave. * The Victory Memorial Bridge in Nashville has 5 lanes, with only the center lane begin a reversible lanes (lane signals without any physical separation). Texas * West Alabama Street and North Main Street in Houston ‚Äì both are three-lane streets, which operate in a 2 in, 1 out configuration during the morning rush, a 1 in, 2 out configuration during the evening rush, and a 1 each way + two-way left turn lane at other times. *N Collins St. from Cowboys Way to E Division St., and E Division St. from N Collins St. to Six Flags Dr., just east of SR 360 are reversible to give access to AT&T; Stadium in Arlington, TX Utah * 5400 South (State Route 173) in Salt Lake County between 1900 West and Bangerter Highway has seven lanes, three of which are reversible and include a center turning lane at all times. Virginia * Washington Boulevard (State Route 237) in Arlington County between 13th Street and Wilson Boulevard ‚Äì this one-block section has only 3 lanes with the center lane reversible by overhead light up indicators. *River Road in Newport News between 75th Street and Shipyard Drive. This is the truck route for Newport News Shipbuilding. =Lane controls and physical separation= * The A38(M) motorway (also known as the Aston Expressway) in Birmingham, England. The road connects the city centre with Spaghetti Junction on the M6. It is a 2-mile, 7-lane section of motorway with no central reservation, and a lower than usual speed limit of 50 mph. Constructed in 1971, it was the United Kingdom's first contraflow road. Overhead lane control signals allow for 4 lanes in and 2 out in the morning rush hour, reversed in the evening, and 3 lanes each way at all other times. One dividing lane is closed to traffic at all times, and motorcycles are permanently prohibited from using the central, red-surfaced lane (with a fixed sign) owing to its use as an off-camber drain. The lane control signals can be set to allow travel in either direction for any lane in exceptional circumstances, which has been used for single-lane, reduced-speed running in each direction (or 2+1 with no divider) during road work, allowing the expressway to remain largely open even during major repairs. However, the 7-lane section splits at both ends to fully divided sets of 4x2 lane slip roads, with the central red lane ending in a barrier, so full use of this flexibility is uncommon and occasional overnight closure is required. * U.S. Route 78 in Snellville, Georgia, United States, has 6 lanes in total. This occurs from the limited access portion through Stone Mountain Park to Georgia State Route 124 (Scenic Highway) for several miles. The middle two lanes were reversible (usually occurring during rush hour) with a varying lane always reserved as a center turn lane; hence 3 lanes were used for one direction of travel and 2 for the other. Example of an intersection on U.S. 78. However, due to rising traffic volumes during peak hours that made traffic flows equivalent, the reversible lane system was removed in 2009.http://www.ajc.com/news/gwinnett/reversible-lane-on-us-124429.html * The Caldecott Tunnel between Oakland, California and Contra Costa County, California previously had three separate bores, with the middle bore switching direction twice daily for rush hour traffic. A fourth tunnel bore opened in November 2013 to westbound traffic.http://www.caldecott-tunnel.org/ Two bores are now permanently used by westbound traffic, and the other two by eastbound traffic, with no reversible lanes. * The Elbe Tunnel near Hamburg, Germany, is part of the Bundesautobahn A7 and has four separate bores, of which two can be switched to allow travel either in each direction or unidirectionally. =Lane controls and physical separation by movable barrier= The Golden Gate Bridge moveable barrier, installed January 2015 * Benjamin Franklin Bridge, Walt Whitman Bridge, and Commodore Barry Bridge in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania * Tappan Zee Bridge (1955) in New York * Theodore Roosevelt Bridge in Washington, D.C. * Auckland Harbour Bridge in Auckland, New Zealand * San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge in San Diego, California (part of California Route 75) * Southeast Expressway in and near Boston, Massachusetts * A reversible lane, also called a zipper lane, is in use on eastbound Interstate H-1 for traffic heading from Leeward Oahu to Pearl Harbor. It is open from 5:30 to 9:00 a.m. * The Golden Gate Bridge (6 lanes total, 2 reversible), connecting San Francisco with suburban Marin County. Prior to 2015, opposing traffic lanes were separated only by plastic pylons, which were moved several times daily by hand and provided minimal physical separation. Installation of a movable median barrier was completed on January 11, 2015. It moves southbound in the morning and northbound in the afternoon * Alex Fraser Bridge in Vancouver, British Columbia (7 lanes total, 1 reversible) * Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in New York City (7 lanes total, 1 reversible) =Third (reversible) carriageways on freeways= * Bundesautobahn 7, New Elbe Tunnel, Hamburg, Germany (actually two reversible carriageways, plus two fixed) * Warringah Expressway in Sydney, Australia * Interstate 5 in Seattle, Washington * Interstate 15 in northern San Diego, California * Interstate 25 and US-36 in Denver, Colorado * Interstate 394 through Minneapolis, Minnesota and its western suburbs * Interstate 90/Interstate 94 (segment of the Kennedy Expressway) in Chicago, Illinois * Interstate 75 and Interstate 575 north of Atlanta, Georgia, and Interstate 75 south of Atlanta * Interstate 279 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (center carriageway reserved for HOV traffic during rush hour) * Lee Roy Selmon Expressway from Brandon to Tampa, Florida * Interstate 64 in Norfolk, Virginia (center carriageway reserved for HOV traffic during rush hour) * Interstate 395 and Interstate 95 through Washington, D.C. and its Virginia suburbs (center carriageway reserved for HOV traffic during rush hour) * Lincoln Tunnel between Weehawken, New Jersey and the New York City borough of Manhattan has three tubes with two lanes each. The center tube carries two lanes in peak direction weekdays (with a reserved inbound bus lane during the AM rush period) and a single lane each direction off-peak (nights, weekends, holidays). * Multiple freeways in Houston have reversible center HOV lanes operated by Houston METRO. * A1 motorway between the interchanges of A9 and A6, Amsterdam, Netherlands. A two lane carriage is opened in the peak direction during rush hours. * A10 motorway, Second Coen Tunnel, Amsterdam, Netherlands. One of the tubes is opened in the peak direction during rush hours. =Entire roadway routinely reversed= * The Anchieta/Imigrantes highway system in Brazil contains the world's longest fully reversible road (The Imigrantes variant at a length of 58.5 km). It comprises a total of 10 lanes distributed over 4 separate roadways (3+3+2+2), each of which can be reversed. Traffic flow is unidirectional on up to three roadways at a time, in different combinations, depending on demand. Since this highway system is the only quick route from S√£o Paulo to the beach, the majority of the traffic on Fridays and Sundays are cars on weekend trips, creating highly asymmetrical demand. * In Washington, D.C., the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway between the Lincoln Memorial and Calvert St. is converted from two lanes in each direction to one-way southbound in the morning and one-way northbound in the evening rush hour Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays. The P Street exit, usually unavailable northbound, is an allowed left exit in the evening. South of Virginia Avenue, two lanes are closed during rush hours to facilitate the merge to or from Virginia Avenue. There are no overhead markings, but police barricades block wrong-way entrances to the roadway. * Canal Road in Washington, D.C. (between Foxhall Road and Arizona Avenue) * Sherman Access in Hamilton, Ontario. 2 lanes total, both marked as reversible, with both lanes flowing in the same direction during rush hour each weekday. * Assembly Street and Bluff Road (both part of South Carolina 48), along with Shop Road and George Rogers Boulevard in Columbia, South Carolina, are one-way during University of South Carolina football games at Williams-Brice Stadium. * The lower deck of the Centre Street Bridge in Calgary, Alberta, is fully reversible. It normally allows for two-way traffic, but both lanes flow in the same direction during rush hour each day. * Victoria Bridge, in Montreal, Quebec, normally allows for two-way traffic. But during rush hours, it only allows one-way traffic, northbound in the morning, and southbound in the afternoon. * Farnam Street in Omaha is a normally two- way, two-lane street that during rush hour becomes one-way eastbound in the morning and westbound in the evening. * Sierichstra√üe in Hamburg, Germany, a fully reversible, two-lane city street. *The White Nile Bridge connecting Khartoum and Omdurman in Sudan, with 4 lanes total. Traffic is generally directed equally, 2 lanes to Khartoum and to lanes from except in the morning, where it's 3 lanes towards Khartoum, and in the evening, 3 lanes towards Omdurman. * In Hong Kong, most vehicular tunnels are dual tube. In the early hours one of the tubes will be closed, and one of the lanes in the other tube carries reversed traffic. * The Baker‚ÄìBarry Tunnel, one of only two means of access to the Marin Headlands from U.S. Route 101 in Marin County, California, is not wide enough to accommodate bidirectional traffic. It consists of a single reversible lane for automobiles and two bicycle lanes. The direction of automobile traffic alternates every five minutes, controlled by a traffic light at each end of the tunnel. The bicycle lanes, one for each direction, are located on either side of the reversible lane; buttons on either side of the tunnel trigger flashing signs alerting drivers entering the tunnel to the presence of cyclists.Innovations in Marin County: The Baker-Barry Tunnel =Entire roadway formerly reversed= * The Southern Expressway in Adelaide, South Australia, was the world's longest exclusively one-way reversible road. It opened in 1997 and eventually traversed though the city's southern suburbs, until its duplication to carry two-way traffic completed in 2014. It changed direction to carry peak hour traffic to the city centre in the morning and away from the city in the evening. On weekends, the directions were reversed. =One lane formerly reversed= *Motorway M7 in Hungary from 1972 until the completion of the second carriageway in 1975. The existing carriageway between T√∂r√∂kb√°lint and Zam√°rdi normally operated with one lane in each direction, but carried traffic towards Budapest only every Sunday afternoon.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq9Wq5hBC3s  Escalators  In shopping centres and metro stations there may be an odd number of escalators, with one or more escalators running in different directions in different time of a day.

He served as the first president of the American Sociological Association. Ward promoted the introduction of sociology courses into American higher education. His belief that society could be scientifically controlled was especially attractive to intellectuals during the Progressive Era. His influence in certain circles (see: the Social Gospel) was affected by his opinions regarding organized priesthoods, which he believed had been responsible for more evil than good throughout human history. Ward emphasized the importance of social forces which could be guided at a macro level by the use of intelligence to achieve conscious progress, rather than allowing evolution to take its own erratic course as proposed by William Graham Sumner and Herbert Spencer. Ward emphasized universal and comprehensive public schooling to provide the public with the knowledge a democracy needs to successfully govern itself. A collection of Ward's writings and photographs is maintained by the Special Collections Research Center of the George Washington University. The collection includes articles, diaries, correspondence, and a scrapbook. GWU's Special Collections Research Center is located in the Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library.Guide to the Lester Frank Ward Papers, 1883‚Äì1919, Special Collections Research Center, Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library, the George Washington University Biography Most, if not all of what is known about Ward's early life comes from the definitive biography, Lester F. Ward: A Personal Sketch, written by Emily Palmer Cape in 1922, where she writes in the foreword: Cape explained later in the foreword: In a footnote on pp. 5‚Äì6, Cape notes: On February 20, 1911, in replying to my asking him to write his autobiography, he says: \\"I don't want to write my autobiography and have it appear while I am alive. It doesn't seem the thing to do. You are the one to write my biography from all the data that I shall leave, but it will be done after I have left them.\\" (The \\"data\\" signified the diaries. The above italics are in Dr. Ward's letter.) =Early life= Lester Frank Ward was born in Joliet, Illinois, the youngest of 10 children born to Justus Ward and his wife Silence Rolph Ward. Justus Ward (d. 1858) was of old New England colonial stock, but he wasn't rich, and farmed to earn a living. Silence Ward was the daughter of a clergyman; she was a talented perfectionist, educated and fond of literature. When Lester Frank was one year old, the family moved closer to Chicago, to a place called Cass, now known as Downers Grove, Illinois about twenty-three miles from Lake Michigan. The family then moved to a homestead in nearby St. Charles, Illinois where his father built a saw mill business making railroad ties. =Early education= Ward first attended a formal school at St. Charles, Kane County, Illinois, in 1850 when he was nine years old. He was known as Frank Ward to his classmates and friends and showed a great enthusiasm for books and learning, liberally supplementing his education with outside reading. Four years after Ward started attending school, his parents, along with Lester and an older brother, Erastus, traveled to Iowa in a covered wagon for a new life on the frontier. Four years later, in 1858, Justus Ward unexpectedly died, and the boys returned the family to the old homestead they still owned in St. Charles. Ward's estranged mother, who lived two miles away with Ward's sister, disapproved of the move, and wanted the boys to stay in Iowa to continue their father's work. The two brothers lived together for a short time in the old family homestead they dubbed \\"Bachelor's Hall,\\" doing farm work to earn a living, and encouraged each other to pursue an education and abandon their father's life of physical labor. In late 1858 the two brothers moved to Pennsylvania at the invitation of Lester Frank's oldest brother Cyrenus (9 years Lester Frank's senior), who was starting a business making wagon wheel hubs and needed workers. The brothers saw this as an opportunity to move closer to civilization and to eventually attend college. The business failed, however, and Lester Frank, who still didn't have the money to attend college, found a job teaching in a small country school; in the summer months he worked as a farm laborer. He finally saved enough money to attend college and enrolled in the Susquehanna Collegiate Institute in 1860. While he was at first self-conscious about his spotty formal education and self learning, he soon found that his knowledge compared favorably to his classmates', and he was rapidly promoted. =Marriage and Civil War service= It was while attending the Susquehanna Collegiate Institute that he met Elizabeth \\"Lizzie\\" Carolyn Vought (some sources cite Bought) and fell deeply in love. Their \\"rather torrid love affair\\" was documented in Ward's first journal Young Ward's Diary. They married on Aug. 13, 1862. Almost immediately afterward, Ward enlisted in the Union Army and was sent to the Civil War front where he was wounded three times. After the end of the war he successfully petitioned for work with the federal government in Washington, DC, where he and Lizzie then moved. Lizzie assisted him in editing a newsletter called \\"The Iconoclast,\\" dedicated to free thinking and attacks on organized religion. She gave birth to a son, but the child died when he was less than a year old. Lizzie died in 1872. Rosamond Asenath Simons was married to Lester Frank Ward as his second wife in the year 1873. =College= After moving to Washington, Ward attended Columbian College, now the George Washington University, and graduating in 1869 with the degree of A.B. In 1871, after he received the degree of LL.B, he was admitted to the Bar of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia). In 1873, he completed his A.M. degree. =Research career and U.S. Geologic Survey= Ward never practiced law, however, and concentrated on his work as a researcher for the federal government. At that time almost all of the basic research in such fields as geography, paleontology, archaeology and anthropology were concentrated in Washington, DC, and a job as a federal government scientist was a prestigious and influential position. In 1883 he was made Geologist of the U.S. Geological Survey. While he worked at the Geological Survey he became good friends with John Wesley Powell, the powerful and influential second director of the US Geological Survey (1881‚Äì1894) and the director of the Bureau of Ethnology at the Smithsonian Institution. Ward and fossil tree trunks =Brown University Chair of Sociology= In 1892, he was named Paleontologist for the USGS, a position he held until 1906, when he resigned to accept the chair of Sociology at Brown University. Works and ideas By the early 1880s, the new field of sociology had become dominated by ideologues of the left and right, both determined to claim \\"the science of society\\" as their own. The champion of the conservatives and businessmen was Herbert Spencer; he was opposed on the left by Karl Marx. Although Spencer and Marx disagreed about many things, they were similar in that their systems were static: they both claimed to have divined the immutable stages of development that a society went through and they both taught that mankind was essentially helpless before the force of evolution. With the publication of the two-volume, 1,200-page, Dynamic Sociology: Or Applied Social Science as Based Upon Statistical Sociology and the Less Complex Sciences (1883), Lester Ward hoped to restore the central importance of experimentation and the scientific method to the field of sociology. For Ward science wasn't cold or impersonal; it was human-centered and results- oriented. As he put it in the Preface to Dynamic Sociology, \\"The real object of science is to benefit man. A science which fails to do this, however agreeable its study, is lifeless. Sociology, which of all sciences should benefit man most, is in danger of falling into the class of polite amusements, or dead sciences. It is the object of this work to point out a method by which the breath of life may be breathed into its nostrils.\\" Ward theorized that poverty could be minimized or eliminated by the systematic intervention of society. Mankind wasn't helpless before the impersonal force of nature and evolution. Through the power of Mind, man could take control of his situation and direct the evolution of human society. This theory is known as telesis. (Also see: meliorism, sociocracy and public sociology). A sociology which intelligently and scientifically directed the social and economic development of society should institute a universal and comprehensive system of education, regulate competition, connect the people on the basis of equal opportunities and cooperation, and promote the happiness and the freedom of everyone. Criticism of laissez-faire Ward is most often remembered for his relentless attack on Herbert Spencer and his theories of laissez-faire and survival of the fittest that totally dominated socio/economic thought in the United States after the American Civil War. While Marx and communism/socialism never caught on in the United States, Spencer became famous and was the leading light for conservatives. Ward placed himself in direct opposition to Spencer and Spencer's American disciple William Graham Sumner, who had become the most well known and widely read American sociologist by single-mindedly promoting the principles of laissez-faire. To quote the historian Henry Steele Commager: \\"Ward was the first major scholar to attack this whole system of negativist and absolutist sociology and he remains the ablest.... Before Ward could begin to formulate that science of society which he hoped would inaugurate an era of such progress as the world had not yet seen, he had to destroy the superstitions that still held domain over the mind of his generation. Of these, laissez-faire was the most stupefying, and it was on the doctrine of laissez-faire that he trained his heaviest guns. The work of demolition performed in Dynamic Sociology, Psychic Factors and Applied Sociology was thorough.\\" Welfare state Ward was a strong supporter of the concept of the welfare state, or state aid for those in need of it. He fiercely criticized those who criticized such policies as paternalistic, writing that the primary critics of state aid for the indigent were the wealthy classes who themselves lobbied for government assistance for their failing enterprises: > The charge of paternalism is chiefly made by the class that enjoys the > largest share of government protection. Those who denounce it are those who > most frequently and successfully invoke it. Nothing is more obvious today > than the signal inability of capital and private enterprise to take care of > themselves unaided by the state; and while they are incessantly denouncing > \\"paternalism,\\" by which they mean the claim of the defenseless laborer and > artisan to a share in this lavish state protection, they are all the while > besieging legislatures for relief from their own incompetency, and \\"pleading > the baby act\\" through a trained body of lawyers and lobbyists. The > dispensing of national pap to this class should rather be called > \\"maternalism,\\" to which a square, open, and dignified paternalism would be > infinitely preferable.Lester Frank Ward, Forum XX, 1895, quoted in Henry > Steel Commager's The American Mind: An Interpretation of American Thought > and Character Since the 1880s (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1950), p. > 210. Female equality Ward was a strong advocate for equal rights for women and even theorized that women were naturally superior to men, much to the scorn of mainstream sociologists. In this regard, Ward presaged the rise of feminism, and especially the difference feminism of writers such as Harvard's Carol Gilligan, who have developed the claims of female superiority. Ward is now considered a feminist writer by historians such as Ann Taylor Allen. However, Clifford H. Scott claims that some suffragists ignored him.Clifford H. Scott, \\"A Naturalistic Rationale For Women's Reform: Lester Frank Ward on the Evolution of Sexual Relations,\\" Historian (1970) 33#1 pp 54‚Äì67 Ward's persuasion on the question of female intelligence as described by himself: \\"And now from the point of view of intellectual development itself we find her side by side, and shoulder to shoulder with him furnishing, from the very outset, far back in prehistoric, presocial, and even prehuman times, the necessary complement to his otherwise one-sided, headlong, and wayward career, without which he would soon have warped and distorted the race and rendered it incapable of the very progress which he claims exclusively to inspire. And herefore again, even in the realm of intellect, where he would fain reign supreme, she has proved herself fully his equal and is entitled to her share of whatever credit attaches to human progress hereby achieved.\\" Clifford H. Scott argues that practically all the suffragists ignored him. Environmental policy in the US Ward had a considerable influence on the United States' environmental policy in the late 19th and early 20th century. Ross listed Ward among the four \\"philosopher/scientists\\" that shaped American early environmental policies. (see: Ross, John R.; Man over Nature) White supremacy and race Ward was a Republican Whig and supported the abolition of the American system of slavery. He enlisted in the Union Army during the Civil War and was wounded three times. However, a close reading of his Dynamic Sociology will uncover several statements that would be considered somewhat racist and ethnocentric by today's standards. There are references to the superiority of Western culture and the savagery of the American Indian and black races, made all the more jarring by the modern feel of much of the rest of the book. However, Ward lived in Washington D.C., then the center of anthropological research in the US; he was always up-to-date on the latest findings of science and in tune with the developing Zeitgeist, and by the early twentieth century, perhaps influenced by W.E.B. Du Bois and German-born Franz Boas, he began to focus more on the question of race. During this period his views on race were arguably more progressive and in tune with modern standards than any other white academic of the time. In the 1870s, as editor of the Iconoclast, he published articles by Frederick Douglas and he was involved in the founding of Howard University. Later, while Charlotte Perkins Gilman and many sociologists supported the eugenics movement, he vigorously opposed it. Later Franz Boaz perhaps even more strongly combated the theory of white supremacy. Lamarckianism Ward is often categorized as being a follower of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. Ward's article \\"Neo-Darwinism and Neo- Lamarckism\\" shows Ward had a sophisticated understanding of this subject. While he clearly described himself as being a Neo-Lamarckian, he completely and enthusiastically accepted Darwin's findings and theories. On the other hand, he believed that, logically, there had to be a mechanism that would allow environmental factors to influence evolution faster than Darwin's rather slow evolutionary process. The modern theory of epigenetics suggests that Ward was correct on this issue, although old-school Darwinians continue to ridicule Larmarkianism.cf. Brody & Body, The Science Class you Wish you Had, 1996 Positivism While Durkheim is usually credited for updating Comte's positivism to modern scientific and sociological standards, Ward accomplished much the same thing 10 years earlier in the United States. However, Ward would be the last person to claim that his contributions were somehow unique or original to him. As Gillis J. Harp points out in The Positivist Republic, Comte's positivism found a fertile ground in the democratic republic of the United States, and there soon developed among the pragmatic intellectual community in New York City, which featured such thinkers as William James and Charles Sanders Peirce, as well as among federal government scientists like Ward in Washington, D.C., a consensus regarding positivism. Theory of war and conflict In Pure Sociology: A Treatise on the Origin and Spontaneous Development of Society (1903) Ward theorizes that throughout human history conflict and war have been the forces that are most responsible for human progress. It was through conflict that hominids gained dominance over animals. It was through conflict and war that Homo Sapiens wiped out the less advanced hominid species, and it was through war that the more technologically advanced races and nations expanded their territory and spread civilization. Ward sees war as a natural evolutionary process and like all natural evolutionary processes war is capricious, slow, often ineffective and shows no regard for the pain inflicted on living creatures. One of the central tenets of Ward's world view is that the artificial is superior to the natural and thus one of the central goals of Applied Sociology is to replace war with a system that retains the progressive elements that war has provided but without the many miseries it inflicts. Influence on U.S. government policy Ward influenced a rising generation of progressive political leaders, such as Herbert Croly. In the book Lester Ward and the Welfare State, Commager details Ward's influence and refers to him as the \\"father of the modern welfare state\\". As a political approach, Ward's system became known as social liberalism, as distinguished from the classical liberalism of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries associated with such thinkers as Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill. While classical liberalism had sought prosperity and progress through laissez- faire, Ward's \\"American social liberalism\\" sought to enhance social progress through direct government intervention. Ward believed that in large, complex and rapidly growing societies human freedom could only be achieved with the assistance of a strong democratic government acting in the interest of the individual. The characteristic element of Ward's thinking was his faith that government, acting on the empirical and scientifically based findings of the science of sociology, could be harnessed to create a near Utopian social order. Progressive thinking had a profound impact on the administrations of Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson and on the liberal wing of the modern Democratic Party. Ward's ideas were in the air but there are few direct links between his writings and the actual programs of the founders of the welfare state and the New Deal. Ward's diaries All but the first of his voluminous diaries were reportedly destroyed by his wife after his death. Ward's first journal, Young Ward's Diary: A Human and Eager Record of the Years Between 1860 and 1870..., remains under copyright. Ward died in Washington, D.C.. He is buried in Watertown, New York.

They play in the Western Canadian Baseball League (WCBL). The Dawgs are five-time WCBL champions. History The Dawgs were originally based in Calgary where they were known as the Calgary Dawgs. The roots of the team date to 1996 (as shown in the team's logo) \\"with the formation of an elite youth travel team\\". The Dawgs joined the WCBL in 2003, playing at Foothills Stadium. They won the 2004 league championship in front of over 3,400 fans. The arrival of the professional Calgary Vipers in 2005 led to numerous bitter conflicts between the two clubs over use of the stadium, and ultimately forced the Dawgs to suspend operations for the 2006 season. The franchise resumed operations in 2007 in the town of Okotoks, 18 kilometres south of Calgary, after brothers Don and Doc Seaman funded the construction of Seaman Stadium at the cost of $8 million. The team has been a huge success in Okotoks. Their average of 1,825 fans per game in 2008 was the most of any baseball team in Alberta and made them the top drawing collegiate team in Canada. Attendance steadily increased to an estimated 2,400 per game by 2011, which team director John Ircandia attributed to the community's enthusiastic support, noting that games \\"kind of became a place to see your neighbours again.\\" The organization operates several high performance teams at the under-18 and under-15 levels. Since their arrival in Okotoks, the community has seen a significant increase in participation in minor baseball, growing from 150 registered players in 2006 to over 500 in 2011. The Dawgs have been equally successful on the field since their move to Okotoks, capturing the 2007, 2008 and 2009 championships. One former Dawg, pitcher Jim Henderson, has gone on to play Major League Baseball. He made his debut with the Milwaukee Brewers in 2012, nine years after he played for the Dawgs. He went on to become the Brewers closer in 2013, collecting 28 saves. Former Dawgs catcher Jordan Procyshen was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in 2014, and spent much of the 2016 through 2018 seasons with the Class A-Advanced Salem Red Sox.

A wooded central range of hills traverses the length of Tablas. The west coast is formed by the western slope of the central mountain ridge, which is narrow and well defined. The summits in the middle of the island are 1,600 to 2,000 feet high. In the center of the island is Bitaogan Peak, high, which appears as a rounded knob from east and west and sharp from north and south. Mount Lunas, at the back of Looc Bay, is a black ridge high, long and rounded from east and west and sharp from north and south; with it the range breaks off to the low pass from Looc Bay to the town of Alcantara on the east coast. The southern part of Tablas is a group of many sharp conical hills, all bare and grassy except Malbug Hill, high, and Calaton Point, high, on the east coast, which are dark and wooded. The shore line is largely mangrove, with many beaches of coral sand and some limestone cliffs. The shore reef is continuous except off Guinauayan Point. There is no good natural harbor except Looc Bay, a large indentation on the west side, but sheltered anchorage may be found on either side of the island, according to the season of the year.U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. \\"United States Coast Pilot, Philippine Islands, Part 1\\", p.186.

In 2020 he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.https://www.amphilsoc.org/blog/american-philosophical-society- welcomes-new-members-2020 Life and early performances Born in Nuremberg, Germany, Watts is the son of a Hungarian mother, Maria Alexandra Gusmits, a pianist; and an American father, Herman Watts, a U.S. Army non-commissioned officer. Andr√© spent his early childhood in Europe, living mostly near army posts where his father was stationed. He began to study the violin when he was four. By six he decided the piano was his instrument. When Andr√© was eight years old, Herman's military assignment brought the family to the United States. They settled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His mother started him with his first piano lessons. As do many children, Watts disliked practicing. For encouragement, his mother would tell stories of the great pianist and composer Franz Liszt, making it clear that Liszt practiced faithfully. Watts found inspiration in Liszt, adopting his theatrical playing style. After the divorce of his parents in 1962, Watts remained with his mother, who supported them by working as a secretary and later as a receptionist. Watts enrolled at the Philadelphia Musical Academy (now a part of the University of the Arts), where he studied with Genia Robinor, Doris Bawden, and Clement Petrillo, graduating in June 1963. He entered his first competition at nine, with forty other children, for the opportunity to perform with the Philadelphia Orchestra Children's Concerts. Watts won the competition playing a concerto by Joseph Haydn. At age ten, Watts performed Mendelssohn's G minor concerto with the Robin Hood Dell Orchestra and at fourteen, Franck's Symphonic Variations, again with the Philadelphia Orchestra. At sixteen, he auditioned at Carnegie Recital Hall in a competition to play in conductor Leonard Bernstein's televised Young People's Concert series with the New York Philharmonic. Career Watts' performance of the Liszt Piano Concerto No. 1 in E-flat at a Young People's Concert on January 12, 1963, was videotaped and nationally televised on CBS on January 15, 1963. Before the concert, Bernstein introduced Watts to the national television audience, stating that he \\"flipped\\" when he first heard Watts play. On January 31, 1963, Bernstein asked Watts to fill in for the ailing Glenn Gould, the scheduled soloist for the New York Philharmonic's regular subscription concert. Watts again played the Liszt E-flat Concerto. When he had sounded his final cadenza, the whole orchestra joined the audience in a standing ovation. Watts' first LP, The Exciting Debut of Andr√© Watts, was shortly thereafter released on Columbia Masterworks records and included the Liszt Concerto with Bernstein and the Philharmonic. Following graduation, Watts enrolled at the Peabody Institute in Baltimore, where he studied part-time for a Bachelor of Music degree with pianist Leon Fleisher. The following year, he appeared at New York City's Lewisohn Stadium with conductor Seiji Ozawa, and the New York Philharmonic, performing Camille Saint-Sa√´ns' Concerto No. 2 in G minor. In September 1963, he again performed the Liszt concerto at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. He opened the 1964-65 season of the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, D.C., again performing the Saint-Sa√´ns concerto. He returned to New York in January 1965 to perform Chopin's Concerto No. 2 in F minor. Watts made his European debut in a London performance with the London Symphony Orchestra in June 1966. By 1969 he was on a full-scale concert schedule, booked three years in advance. Watts made his Boston debut in 1969 for the Peabody Mason Concert series.Record American, 7-Mar-1969, George Gelles, \\"Watts outstanding in all- Liszt recital\\", Boston He graduated from the Peabody Institute in 1972. In February 1973, Watts was selected as Musical America's Musician of the Month. Other honors and awards include doctor honoris causa from Albright College and Yale University, the Order of Zaire, a University of the Arts Medal from the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, and the National Medal of Arts. By the mid-1970s, Watts was giving 150 concerts, recitals, and chamber performances per season, performing about eight months out of the year. In 1976, at age thirty, he celebrated his tenth consecutive appearance in the Lincoln Center Great Performers Series at Avery Fisher Hall. The PBS Sunday afternoon telecast was the first solo recital presented on Live from Lincoln Center and the first full-length recital to be aired nationally in prime time. In November 2002, Watts suffered a subdural hematoma and underwent emergency surgery. In 2004, he also had surgery for a ruptured disc which was affecting the use of his left hand. He continued performing regularly after recovering from the surgeries. In 2004 Watts joined the faculty at Indiana University, where he holds the Jack I. and Dora B. Hamlin Endowed Chair in Music. In 2019, he underwent surgery for a nerve injury to his left hand resulting in the cancellation of several performances. He has reworked the Ravel Concerto for Left Hand to perform with his right hand and will be performing the work with the Detroit and Atlanta Symphony Orchestras.https://www.atlantasymphony.org/ConcertsAndTickets/Calendar/2019-2020/CS16-Beethovenhttps://www.dso.org/events- and-tickets/events/classical-roots-featuring-andre-watts/ Recording artist Watts has recorded for several music labels. He signed a long-term exclusive contract with Columbia Masterworks Records on his 21st birthday. In 1977, he revealed that his contract had been terminated. In 1985, he signed a recording contract with EMI, with whom he recorded until the early 1990s. He has also recorded for Telarc. Watts has recorded a variety of repertoire, concentrating on Romantic era composers such as Chopin and Liszt, but also including Gershwin.

A study in prestigious medical journal The Lancet, published in July 2020, defined \\"mid- life\\" as being 45‚Äì65 years. Young adulthood This time in the lifespan is considered to be the developmental stage of those who are between 18 years old and 45 years old. Recent developmental theories have recognized that development occurs across the entire life of a person as they experience changes cognitively, physically, socially, and in personality.Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version (W. W. Norton, 1998), Middle adulthood This time period in the life of a person can be referred to as middle age. This time span has been defined as the time between ages 45 and 60 or, more usually, 65 years old. Many changes may occur between young adulthood and this stage. The body may slow down and the middle aged might become more sensitive to diet, substance abuse, stress, and rest. Chronic health problems can become an issue along with disability or disease. Approximately one centimeter of height may be lost per decade. Emotional responses and retrospection vary from person to person. Experiencing a sense of mortality, sadness, or loss is common at this age. Those in middle adulthood or middle age continue to develop relationships and adapt to the changes in relationships. Changes can be the interacting with growing and grown children and aging parents. Community involvement is fairly typical of this stage of adulthood, as well as continued career development. =Physical characteristics= Middle-aged adults may begin to show visible signs of aging. This process can be more rapid in women who have osteoporosis. Changes might occur in the nervous system. The ability to perform complex tasks remains intact. Women experience menopause in the years surrounding the age of 50, which ends natural fertility. Menopause can have many side effects, some welcome and some not so welcome. Men may also experience physical changes. Changes can occur to skin and other changes may include decline in physical fitness including a reduction in aerobic performance and a decrease in maximal heart rate. These measurements are generalities and people may exhibit these changes at different rates and times. The mortality rate can begin to increase from 45 and onwards, mainly due to health problems like heart problems, cancer, hypertension, and diabetes. Still, the majority of middle-aged people in industrialized nations can expect to live into old age. =Cognitive characteristics= Erik Erikson refers to this period of adulthood as the generativity-versus-stagnation stage. Persons in middle adulthood or middle age may have some cognitive loss. This loss usually remains unnoticeable because life experiences and strategies are developed to compensate for any decrease in mental abilities. =Social and personality characteristics= Marital satisfaction remains but other family relationships can be more difficult. Career satisfaction focuses more on inner satisfaction and contentedness and less on ambition and the desire to \\"advance\\". Even so, career changes often can occur. Middle adulthood or middle age can be a time when a person re-examines their life by taking stock, and evaluating their accomplishments. Morality may change and become more conscious. The perception that those in this stage of development of life undergo a \\"mid-life\\" crisis is largely false. This period in life is usually satisfying, tranquil. Personality characteristics remain stable throughout this period. The relationships in middle adulthood may continue to evolve into connections that are stable.

It is also used to help with endotracheal intubation; however, suxamethonium (succinylcholine) is generally preferred if this needs to be done quickly. It is given by injection into a vein. Effects are greatest at about 4 minutes and last for up to an hour. Side effects may include low blood pressure and prolonged paralysis. Allergic reactions are rare. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. Vecuronium is in the aminosteroid neuromuscular-blocker family of medications and is of the non-depolarizing type. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine on skeletal muscles. Vecuronium was approved for medical use in the United States in 1984. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Vecuronium is available as a generic medication. In the United States it is less than 25 a dose. The effects may be reversed with a combination of neostigmine and atropine.  Mechanism of action  Vecuronium operates by competing for the cholinoceptors at the motor end plate, thereby exerting its muscle-relaxing properties, which are used adjunctively to general anesthesia. Under balanced anesthesia, the time to recovery to 25% of control (clinical duration) is approximately 25 to 40 minutes after injection and recovery is usually 95% complete approximately 45 to 65 minutes after injection of an intubating dose. The neuromuscular blocking action of vecuronium is slightly enhanced in the presence of potent inhalation anesthetics. If vecuronium is first administered more than 5 minutes after the start of the inhalation of enflurane, isoflurane, or halothane, or when a steady state has been achieved, the intubating dose of vecuronium may be decreased by approximately 15%. Vecuronium has an active metabolite, 3-desacetyl-vecuronium, that has 80% of the effect of vecuronium. Accumulation of this metabolite, which is cleared by the kidneys, can prolong the duration of action of the drug, particularly when an infusion is used in a person with kidney failure. Reversal of vecuronium can be accomplished by administration of sugammadex which is a Œ≥-cyclodextrin which encapsulates vecuronium preventing it from binding to receptors. Reversal can also be accomplished with neostigmine or other cholinesterase inhibitors, but their efficacy is lower than that of sugammadex. History As long ago as 1862, adventurer Don Ramon Paez described a Venezuelan poison, guachamaca, which the indigenous peoples used to lace sardines as bait for herons and cranes. If the head and neck of a bird so killed was cut off, the remainder of the flesh could be eaten safely. Paez also described the attempt of a Llanero woman to murder a rival to her lover's affections with guachamaca and unintentionally killed 10 other people when her husband shared his food with their guests. It is probable that the plant was Malouetia nitida or Malouetia schomburgki. The genus Malouetia (Family Apocynaceae) is found in both South America and Africa. The botanist Robert E. Woodson Jr comprehensively classified the American species of Malouetia in 1935. At that time, only one African species of Malouetia was recognised, but the following year Woodson described a second: Malouetia bequaertiana, from the Belgian Congo. It was in 1960 that scientists reported the isolation of malouetine from the roots and bark of Malouetia bequaertiana Woodson by means of an ion exchange technique. A pure form of the substance was first synthesised in 1964, and was named pancuronium bromide. The name was derived from p(iperidino)an(drostane)cur(arising)-onium. A paper published in 1973 discussed the structure-activity relationships of a series of aminosteroid muscle relaxants, including the mono-quaternary analogue of pancuronium, later called vecuronium. Society and culture It is commercially available as ampoules containing 4 or 10 mg of the drug in powder form which needs to be dissolved in distilled water prior to being given. =Non-medical use= Vecuronium bromide has been used as part of a drug cocktail that prisons in the United States use as a means to put a condemned prisoner to death. Vecuronium is used to paralyze the prisoner and stop his or her breathing, in conjunction with a sedative and potassium chloride to stop the prisoner's heart. Injections of vecuronium bromide without proper sedation allow the person to be fully awake but unable to move in response to pain. In 2001, Japanese nurse Daisuke Mori was reported to have murdered 10 patients using vecuronium bromide. He was convicted of murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment.

Biography  Scherr was born in Hohenrechberg (today part of Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd), W√ºrttemberg. After studying philosophy and history at the University of T√ºbingen (1837-1840), he became master in a school conducted by his brother Thomas in Winterthur. In 1843 he moved to Stuttgart, and, entering the political arena with a pamphlet W√ºrttemberg im Jahr 1843, was elected in 1848 a member of the W√ºrttemberg House of Deputies; became leader of the democratic party in south Germany and, in consequence of his agitation for parliamentary reform in 1849, was obliged, to take refuge in Switzerland to avoid arrest. Condemned in contumaciam to fifteen years hard labor, he established himself in Z√ºrich as Privatdozent in 1850, but moved in 1852 to Winterthur. In 1860 he was appointed professor of history and Helvetian literature at the Polytechnicum in Z√ºrich, in which city he died.  Work  Scherr was a voluminous writer in the field of historical investigation into the civilization, literature, and manners and customs of his country. His works, characterized by their caustic wit and many peculiarities in point of diction, have largely a political bias, but are characterized by clearness of exposition and careful research. Noteworthy among his books are the following: *Deutsche Kultur-und Sitten-Geschichte (‚ÄúHistory of German culture and customs,‚Äù 1852-1853, new ed. 1897) *Schiller und seine Zeit (‚ÄúShiller and his times,‚Äù 1859, new ed. 1876) *Geschichte der deutschen Frauenwelt (‚ÄúHistory of German women,‚Äù 1860, 4th ed. 1879) *Allgemeine Geschichte der Literatur (‚ÄúA history of literature,‚Äù 1851, 9th ed. 1895-1896) *Geschichte der englischen Literatur (‚ÄúHistory of English literature,‚Äù 1854, 2nd ed. 1883) *Bl√ºcher, seine Zeit und sein Leben (‚ÄúLife and times of Bl√ºcher,‚Äù 1862, 4th ed. 1887) *Germania. Zwei Jahrtausende deutschen Lebens (‚ÄúGermania. Two millennia of German life,‚Äù 1879, 6th ed. by Hans Prutz 1905) Scherr also wrote the humorous Sommertagebuch des weiland Dr Gastrosophiae, Jeremia Sauerampfer (1873); as a novelist he published the historical novels, Schiller (1856), and Michel, Geschichte eines Deutschen unserer Zeit (1858) which have passed through several editions. With the exception of some of his stories (Novellenbuch, 10 vols 1873-1877) Scherr's works have not appeared in a collected edition. Family In 1845, Scherr married the Swiss writer Maria Susanna K√ºbler who is remembered for her early cookbooks and household guides.

Religious activities generally need some infrastructure to be conducted. For this reason, there generally exist religion-supporting organizations, which are some form of organization that manage: * the upkeep of places of worship, such as mosques, churches, temples, synagogues, chapels and other buildings or meeting places. * the payment of salaries to religious leaders, such as Roman Catholic priests, Hindu priests, Christian ministers, imams and rabbis. In addition, such organizations usually have other responsibilities, such as the formation, nomination or appointment of religious leaders, the establishment of a corpus of doctrine, the disciplining of leaders and followers with respect to religious law, and the determination of qualification for membership. Legal status =Public organizations= Some countries run the activities of one or more religions as part of their government, or as external organizations closely supported by the government. See state religion. =Private organizations= In some countries, the government is prohibited by law from establishing or supporting religions by separation of church and state, though there may be exceptions to such rules. Religions are thus necessarily supported by private organizations, generally funded by those who attend their services. France The French Republic is constitutionally la√Øque (roughly, secular). It is prohibited by a 1905 statute for the state to subsidize or recognize any religion, or to pay stipends; for historical reasons, this statute does not apply to the Alsace- Moselle area (where four religions are state-subsidized under the local law), to French Guiana (Catholic priests are employed by the local government, although this situation is likely to change) and to military chaplains (, there are indications that the statute of religious services to the military will be changed). Religious organizations are not required to register, but may if they wish to apply for tax-exempt status or to gain official recognition. The French government defines two categories under which religious groups may register: associations cultuelles (associations of worship, which are exempt from taxes) and associations culturelles (cultural associations, which are not exempt from all taxes). Associations in these two categories are subject to certain management and financial disclosure requirements. An association of worship may organize only religious activities, defined as liturgical services and practices. A cultural association may engage in profit-making activity. Although a cultural association is not exempt from taxes, it may receive government subsidies for its cultural and educational operations, such as schools. Religious groups normally register under both of these categories; the Mormons, for example, runs strictly religious activities through its association of worship and operates a school under its cultural association. Under the 1905 statute, religious groups must apply with the local prefecture to be recognized as an association of worship and receive tax-exempt status. The prefecture reviews the submitted documentation regarding the association's purpose for existence. To qualify, the group's purpose must be solely the practice of some form of religious ritual. Printing publications, employing a board president, or running a school may disqualify a group from receiving tax-exempt status. A common method is to run such activities in another financially separate association (\\"cultural association\\" or other similar denomination). According to the 1905 law, associations of worship are not taxed on the donations that they receive. However, the prefecture may decide to review a group's status if the association receives a large donation or legacy that comes to the attention of the tax authorities. If the prefecture determines that the association is not in fact in conformity with the 1905 law, its status may be changed, and it may be required to pay taxes at a rate of 60 percent on present and past donations. According to the 100 Catholic associations are tax-exempt; a representative of the Ministry of Interior reports that the number of non-tax-exempt Catholic associations is too numerous to estimate accurately. More than 50 associations of the Jehovah's Witnesses have tax-free status. United States In the United States, a faith-based organization (FBO) is an organization that has its mission based in a faith system. The U.S. IRS designates tax exemptions for those legal entities that qualify. To be a legal entity in America each organization must file the required documents in the U.S. states in which they operate.

Schutzstege), in architecture, is a term quoted by Vitruvius when referring to the rise given to the stylobate in the centre of the front and sides of a Greek temple. His explanation is not clear; he states (iii. 4) that, if set out level, the stylobate would have the appearance of being sunk in the centre, so that it is necessary that there should be an addition by means of small steps (scamilli impares). In book v. chap. 9, he again refers to the addition on the stylobate. The interpretation of his meaning by Penrose and other authorities is generally assumed to be the addition which it was necessary to leave on the lower frustum of the Doric column, or on the lower portion of the base of the Ionic column, so as to give them a proper bearing on the curved surface of the stylobate; when levelling ground, however, it is sometimes the custom to fix at intervals small bricks or tiles which are piled up until the upper surfaces of all of them are absolutely level. If, as an alternative, these piles were so arranged as to rise towards the centre, instead of a level a slightly curved surface might be obtained, and the term unequal steps would apply to them. This was the opinion of M. Bernouf, a French author, who points out that scamilus is a diminutive of scamnum, a small step (Fr. petit banc), which in some parts of France is employed when levelling the surface of areas or courts. According to Penrose, the rise of the curved stylobate of the Parthenon had already been obtained in the stereobate carrying it, long before the problem of bedding the columns on the curve had arisen.

Early life The second son of the 1st Baron Abinger, he was born in London and educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, In 1835, he married Charlotte Anne Hargreaves, a coal heiress from Burnley, the town becoming his adopted home. Career Scarlett entered the army in 1818, as a cornet in the 18th Hussars; in 1830, he became a major in the 5th Dragoon Guards, whose Colonel was Sir John Slade (1762-1859). Slade served in the Peninsular War, where he was described as an officer of 'limited ability, lacking initiative and nearly useless' and 'that damned stupid fellow.' Combined with Slade's age, this resulted in Scarlett's appointment as Commanding Officer of the regiment in 1840, a post he held for nearly fourteen years. In 1854 he was close to retirement after an uneventful career during which he had not seen any active service. In this he was typical of the senior ranks of the British cavalry at the time, other than those posted to India. =Crimean War= In April 1854 Colonel Scarlett was appointed Brigadier-General of the Heavy Brigade of Cavalry, under Lord Lucan, Commander of the Cavalry Division. The 5th Dragoon Guards formed part of Scarlett's Heavy Brigade which was sent to the Black Sea in 1854. There it suffered heavily from cholera in the camps of Varna. Battle of Balaclava. Russian cavalry attacks over the Causeway Heights During the Battle of Balaclava on the morning of 25 October 1854, the Russians had stormed a series of hills known as the Causeway Heights beyond which lay the \\"Valley of Death\\" where the Earl of Cardigan would lead the Light Brigade in one of the great military blunders of the nineteenth century. Lord Raglan ordered that Scarlett should move eight squadrons of his brigade back to Kadikoi, to support the 93rd Highlanders defence of the British base at Balaklava. As Scarlett led his column of the Heavy Brigade across the sprawling tented camp of the Light Brigade, a Russian cavalry force of approximately 2000 was spotted just 800 yards from their left flank, at the top of the heights. The 55-year-old Scarlett quickly assembled just 300 of his Inniskillings and Scots Greys (of Waterloo fame) at the foot of the heights, organising them into parade-perfect formation, and sounded the charge. As astounded onlookers watched from the rear, Scarlett led his red-clad Heavies into the centre of the grey mass of Russians. His attack was soon followed by rest of the column (the remainder of the Inniskillings and the 4th, and 5th Dragoon Guards). Even the two squadrons of 1st Royal Dragoons who had remained behind to hold the Brigade's original position attacked on their own initiative. This action became known as the Charge of the Heavy Brigade and caused the enemy formation to collapse completely. The Russians were routed and retreated across the heights into the valley that shortly after would become so infamous. Although successful, it defied military doctrine of the time, as the Russians were more numerous and, more importantly, the charge was made uphill against an oncoming force. Cardigan had observed the action with his Lights from a short distance away, and had he used his initiative and chosen this moment to finish what Scarlett had started, the Charge of the Light Brigade might well have been remembered as a success. Later when Cardigan finally led his men into the valley, the Earl of Lucan, Scarlett and the Heavies waited in reserve. Scarlett had started to advance in the hope of salvaging something from the disaster when Lucan, fearing the complete loss of the Light Brigade, sounded the retreat. =After Balaclava= For his services that day Scarlett was promoted major-general and in 1855 was made KCB. After a brief period of leave in England, he returned to the Crimea with the local rank of lieutenant-general to command the British cavalry. Following the Peace of Paris, Scarlett commanded the cavalry at Aldershot until 1857, was Lieutenant-Governor of Portsmouth and General Officer Commanding South West District from 1857 to 1860 and then Adjutant-General to the Forces from 1860 to 1865. He was then made commander of the Aldershot Division, a post he held until his retirement in 1870. He had been made a GCB in 1869. =Politics= From 1837 until 1841 he was a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Guildford. In retirement Scarlett again became involved in politics, standing for election to Parliament in Burnley at the 1868 general election, but was narrowly beaten by the Liberal candidate. Later life Scarlett died at his Bank Hall estate in Burnley, Lancashire in December 1871, aged 72. He is buried at Church of St John the Divine, Holme Chapel, Cliviger near Burnley. An estimated 60,000 people lined the streets of the Lancashire town for his funeral procession. Character While lacking direct military experience at the outbreak of the Crimean War, Brigadier Scarlett selected his aides-de-camp from able officers who had seen active service in India, and followed their advice. This was in marked contrast to other generals such as Cardigan, who for reasons of social snobbery looked down on \\"Indian officers\\".Woodham-Smith, pgs 60-61 Described as being brave, modest and sensible, Scarlett won popularity amongst the Heavy Brigade. An officer of the Light Brigade of Cavalry commented \\"Good kind old fellow that he is, they are all very fond of him and will follow him anywhere\\". Memorials Royal Garrison Church at Aldershot A memorial to Scarlett was installed in the Royal Garrison Church at Aldershot. It includes a bronze bust of Scarlett flanked by two full-size bronze cavalry troopers of his former regiments, the 18th Hussars and 5th Dragoon Guards, wearing VCs, four-bar Crimean War medals and Long Service and Good Conduct medals.

History Scavenger's daughter. Inquisition Exhibition at the Palacio de los Olvidados in Granada. The Scavenger's Daughter (or Skevington's Daughter) was invented as an instrument of torture in the reign of Henry VIII by Sir Leonard Skevington, Lieutenant of the Tower of London,Scavenger's Daughter\\" Retrieved 25 March 2011 a son of Sir William Skeffington, Lord Deputy of Ireland, and his first wife, Margaret Digby. It was an A-frame shaped metal rack; the head was strapped to the top point of the A, the hands at the midpoint, and the legs at the lower spread ends. The frame could fold, swinging the head down and forcing the knees up into a sitting position, compressing the body so as to force the blood from the nose and ears. The Scavenger's Daughter was conceived as the perfect complement to the Duke of Exeter's Daughter (the rack) because it worked according to the opposite principle by compressing the body rather than stretching it. The best-documented use is that on the Irishman Thomas Miagh, charged with being in contact with rebels in Ireland. It may be in connection with the Scavenger's Daughter that Miagh carved on the wall of the Beauchamp Tower in the Tower of London, \\"By torture straynge my truth was tried, yet of my libertie denied. 181. Thomas Miagh.\\" Another victim of the Scavenger's Daughter was Thomas Cottam, an English Catholic priest and martyr from Lancashire, who suffered it twice before being released.Selwood, Dominic, England's Salem, Catholic Herald, 31 October 2018 Cottam would eventually be executed during the reign of Henry's successor, Elizabeth I.

He is a leading exponent of architecture that addresses the contemporary notion of a \\"simulated\\" city, and has been called \\"one of the world's most innovative and influential architects.\\" In 2013, Ito was awarded the Pritzker Prize, one of architecture's most prestigious prizes. He was a likely front-runner for the Pritzker Prize for the previous 10 years. A recent trend has seen less experienced and well-known winners, for example Chinese architect Wang Shu in 2012, and the award to Toyo Ito is seen as recognition of a lifetime's achievement in architecture. Early life and education Ito was born in Seoul, Korea to Japanese parents on 1 June 1941. In 1943, he moved to Japan with his mother and two sisters living until middle school age in rural Shimosuwa, Nagano Prefecture. Ito attended Hibiya High School in central Tokyo and graduated from the University of Tokyo's department of architecture in 1965. Career After working for Kiyonori Kikutake Architect and Associates from 1965 to 1969 (alongside Itsuko Hasegawa), in 1971 he started his own studio in Tokyo, named Urbot (\\"Urban Robot\\"). In 1979, the studio name was changed to Toyo Ito & Associates. Throughout his early career Ito constructed numerous private house projects that expressed aspects of urban life in Japan. His most remarkable early conceptual contributions were made through projects of this scale, such as White U (1976) and Silver Hut (1984). With the Pao for the Tokyo Nomad Girl projects in 1985 and 1989, Ito presented a vision of the life of an urban nomad, illustrative of typical lifestyles during the bubble economy period in Japan. Tower of Winds (1986) and Egg of Winds (1991) are interactive landmarks in public spaces, resulting from a creative interpretation of contemporary technical possibilities. Whilst their function is in fact exhaust air outlets for the underground system below, their significance lies in Ito's treatment of their opacity, one of the hallmarks of his work. Whilst appearing solid during the day, the perforated aluminium structures \\"dissolve\\" at night through the use of computer-controlled light systems which form an interactive display representing measured data such as noise levels in their surrounding vicinity. Toyo Ito's office is known as a training ground for talented younger architects. Architects who previously worked for his office include Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa (SANAA), Astrid Klein and Mark Dytham (KDa), Katsuya Fukushima, Makoto Yokomizo, and Akihisa Hirata. =Critical vision= Ito's work is often said to have affinities with the ideas of philosophers such as Munesuke Mita and Gilles Deleuze. Ito has defined architecture as \\"clothing\\" for urban dwellers, particularly in the contemporary Japanese metropolis. This theme revolves around the equilibrium between the private life and the metropolitan, \\"public\\" life of an individual. The current architecture of Toyo Ito expands on his work produced during the postmodern period, aggressively exploring the potentials of new forms. In doing so, he seeks to find new spatial conditions that manifest the philosophy of borderless beings. =Exhibitions= Ito's work has been exhibited widely. In 1991, Ito used 130 video projectors to simulate the urban environment of Tokyo for the Visions of Japan exhibition at The Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Later, in 2000, his Vision and Reality at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art also became a traveling exhibition. Ito similarly exploited the effect of video projection as a medium with which to exhibit architecture in his Blurring Architecture exhibition, initiated at the Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum in Aachen and traveling to four other cities (Tokyo, Antwerp, Auckland, and Wellington between 1999 and 2001). Ito designed the Berlin-Tokyo/Tokyo-Berlin Exhibition (2006) at the Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin. The design featured a smooth, undulating landscape that occupied almost the entirety of the museum's main exhibition space. This exhibition, in collaboration with the Mori Art Museum, was one of the largest undertakings in the museum's history. A major retrospective of Ito's work was shown at the Tokyo Opera City Art Gallery in 2006 as Toyo Ito: The New \\"Real\\" in Architecture. =List of works= Source: * 1976 ‚Äì White U House (house for his sister) * 1984 ‚Äì Silver Hut (Ito's own house, adjacent to White U) * 1986 ‚Äì Tower of Winds, West Exit, Yokohama Station, Nishi-ku, Yokohama * 1991 ‚Äì Yatsushiro Municipal Museum * 1994 ‚Äì Old People's Home in Yatsushiro * 2001 ‚Äì Sendai Mediatheque: a multi-function complex accommodating a mixed programme of library, art gallery, audio-visual library, film studio and caf√©.

He was noted for his mastery in reproducing the effect of candlelight, and painted in the exquisite and highly polished manner of the Leiden fijnschilders.  Life and work  Godfried Schalcken was born in Made, North Brabant, the son of Cornelis Schalcken and Aletta Lydius. Before he was four years old, his family moved to Dordrecht, where his father became rector of the Latin school. Schalcke studied under Samuel van Hoogstraten in Dordrecht before he moved to Leiden, into the studio of Gerard Dou (1613‚Äì1675), one of Rembrandt's most famous pupils. His earlier genre pictures very closely resemble Dou's work. He worked in Leiden until c. 1675, then returning to Dordrecht until 1691, after which he settled in The Hague, where he continued to paint until his death, near age 63, in 1706. He also visited England (1692‚Äì1697), but his uncouth manners and bad temper alienated him from the society there. In 1703 he was employed by Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine in D√ºsseldorf. He died in The Hague. Work Schalcken painted several portraits, of which the half-length of William III of England, now in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, is a good example. Like Dou, Schalcken specialised in small scenes lit by candlelight, a technique that found favour with the fijnschilders. Examples are in Buckingham Palace, the Louvre, Vienna and Dresden. His painting, Lady, Come into the Garden (Buckingham Palace), was singled out by his pupil Arnold Houbraken as representative of his oeuvre. Other good examples are Old Woman Scouring a Pan and Soldier Giving Money to a Woman (London, National Gallery), Ceres Seeking Proserpine and Old Man Writing (Louvre), Woman(National Museum of Serbia), Girl Blowing Out Taper (Munich), Girl Reading Letter (Dresden Gallery), The Boy Angling (Berlin); and Toilet by Candle (The Hague). The Buckingham Palace collection also possesses an interior by Schalcken. His history paintings are less-well known. His pupils were Arnold Boonen, Godefridus Callenfels, Simon Germain, Carel de Moor, Richard Morris, Arent Pijl, his cousin Jacob Schalcken, his sister Maria Schalcken, and Anthony Vreem.

Biography Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten trained first with his father Dirk van Hoogstraten and stayed in Dordrecht until about 1640. On the death of his father, he moved to Amsterdam where he entered the workshop of Rembrandt. A short time later, he started out on his own as a master and painter of portraits. He later made several travels which took him (1651) to Vienna, Rome and London, finally retiring to Dordrecht. There he married in 1656, and held an appointment as provost of the mint. Paintings and etches Tromp-l'oeil still life, 1664 View of a Corridor, Dyrham Park, 1662 A sufficient number of Van Hoogstraten's works have been preserved to show that he strove to imitate different styles at different times. In a portrait dated 1645, currently in the Lichtenstein collection in Vienna, he imitates Rembrandt. He continued in this vein until as late as 1653 when he produced a figure of a bearded man looking out of a window. This, one of the more characteristic examples of his style, is exhibited in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. He was also skilled at tromp-l'oeil still lifes. A view of the Vienna Hofburg, dated 1652, displays his skill as a painter of architecture. In contrast, a piece at the Hague representing a \\"Lady Reading a Letter as she crosses a Courtyard\\" (Mauritshuis) or a \\"Lady Consulting a Doctor,\\" (in the Rijksmuseum at Amsterdam), imitates de Hooch. One of his last remaining works is a portrait of Mathys van den Brouck, dated 1670. Hoogstraten also employed his skill with perspective to construct \\"peepshows\\", or \\"perspective boxes\\". For example, A Peepshow with Views of the Interior of a Dutch HouseNational Gallery display of Hoogstraten's perspective box. is a box with convincing 3D views of the interior of a Dutch house when viewed through peepholes on either end of the box.Samuel van Hoogstraten Biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature One of his perspective boxes is on show at the National Gallery in London. It shows the interior of a typical Dutch house of his time. He produced many etchings as well, and some of his plates are still preserved. His self-portrait, engraved by himself at the age of fifty, still exists. His pupils were his younger brother Jan van Hoogstraten, Aert de Gelder, Cornelis van der Meulen, and Godfried Schalcken.Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten in the RKD Literary work =Art theoretician= Van Hoogstraten's fame derives from his versatile career as a painter, poet and zealous social climber. Besides painting and directing a mint, he devoted some of his time to literary labours. His magnum opus is a book on painting, the Introduction to the Academy of Painting, or the Visible World (original title: 'Inleyding tot de hooge schoole der schilderkonst: anders de zichtbaere werelt', Rotterdam, 1678) which is in length and theoretical scope one of the most ambitious treatises on the art of painting published in the Dutch Republic in the seventeenth century.Thijs Weststeijn, 'The Visible World: Samuel Van Hoogstraten's Art Theory and the Legitimation of Painting in the Dutch Golden Age', Amsterdam University Press, 2008Inleyding tot de hooge schoole der schilderkonst: anders de zichtbaere werelt) (1678) in the DBNL It covers issues such as pictorial persuasion and illusionism, the painter's moral standards and the relation of painting to philosophy, referring to various ancient and modern authors. While reacting to international, mainly Southern European ideas on painting which Van Hoogstraten may have encountered during his travels, the treatise also reflects contemporary talk and thought on art from Dutch studios. He wrote it as a sequel to Karel van Mander's early-17th- century book on painting and painters entitled Het Schilder-Boeck. One of van Hoogstraten's many students, Arnold Houbraken, later wrote the book entitled The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters, which included a biography of his teacher. This biography is the basis of most of the information that we have about van Hoogstraten today. =Sonnets and tragedies= Van Hoogstraten also composed sonnets and tragedies. We are indebted to him for some of the familiar sayings of Rembrandt.

Regimental Marches The Regimental Quick March is Hielan' Laddie. The Regimental Slow March is The Garb of Old Gaul.  History  Regimental badge of the Scots Guards Drum major Sgt. Martin Godsman in 2009. The Scots Guards is a regiment that was formed by King Charles I in 1642. It is known that in 1716 a small band of \\"hautbouys\\" existed; however, the precise origins of the Band of the Scots Guards are unknown. The band grew in strength during the early part of the 19th century and by 1838, it could boast some 32 performers. Throughout the 19th century the band expanded, until in 1888, there was an establishment of 44. During the First World War it entertained troops at Ypres and the Somme in 1916. During the Second World War it was entertaining troops on the home front. This was sometimes through the medium of wireless, an example being 18 March 1942, when at 1 am, band members reported for a BBC Overseas Broadcast at the Paris Cinema. Musicians also found themselves on Fire Watch duties based at Egerton House, Buckingham Gate. The Scots Guards was the only Foot Guards Band to be deployed on active service during the Gulf War in 1990 (with three of their colleagues from the Irish Guards Band). Many different aspects of hospital duties attached to the various departments of 33 General Hospital based in Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia were involved in their work there. In 1992, the Colonel of the Regiment, The Duke of Kent presented Gulf War Medals to Band members.  Ensembles  There are several ensembles within the Band of the Scots Guards: * Concert band * Marching band * Dance band * Fanfare Trumpeters * Brass Quintet * Wind Quintet * String Quartet * Orchestra * Jazz Ensemble  Events  The band outside Victoria Barracks, Windsor. The Band of the Scots Guards plays for events of state.

It is also often used to refer to an elder, since it can take time to accumulate the wealth to fund the travel (particularly before the advent of mass air travel), and in many Muslim societies as an honorific title for a respected man. The title is placed before a person's name; for example Saif Gani becomes Hajji Saif Gani. \\"Had≈æi\\" is also used in Orthodox Christianity for people who go on pilgrimage to the grave of Christ in Jerusalem. It can then be added to the pilgrim's first name, e.g., Had≈æi-Prodan, Had≈æi-ƒêera, Had≈æi-Ruvim, Had≈æi- Melentije Stevanoviƒá Hajji is derived from the Arabic ', which is the active participle of the verb ' (\\"to make the pilgrimage\\"). The alternative form ' is derived from the name of the Hajj with the adjectival suffix -ƒ´, and this was the form adopted by non-Arabic languages. In some areas the title has become a family name, for example in the Bosniak surname Had≈æiosmanoviƒá (\\"son of Hajji Osman\\"). Use In Arab countries, ' and ' (pronunciation varies according to the form of Arabic spoken) is a commonly used manner of addressing any older person respectfully, regardless of whether or not the person in question has actually performed the pilgrimage. In Malay-speaking countries, and are titles given to Muslim males and females respectively who have performed the pilgrimage. These are abbreviated Hj and Hjh. The term is also used in the Balkan Christian countries that were once under Ottoman rule (Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Romania) for a Christian who had traveled to Jerusalem and the Holy Lands. In Cyprus the title became so prevalent as to be permanently integrated into some Greek Christian family names, such as Hajiioannou. This was due to Cyprus being so close to the Holy Lands and Jerusalem, as Cyprus became a place where Christians and Muslims intermixed freely for many centuries. In Iran the honorific title Haj () is sometimes used for IRGC commanders, instead of the title Sardar (\\"General\\").

This surah takes its name from the 27th verse. Time of revelation This surah contains the qualities of both the Makki and the Madani Surahs, the tafsirs have contrasted as to its time of disclosure, however, in the light of its style and subjects, it appears that first 24 ƒÄyah (vv. 1-24) were sent down in the last phase of the Makki life of Muhammad a little before movement to Medina and the rest of the surah(vv. 25-78) during the initial phase of his Madani life. That is the reason this surah joins the qualities of both the Makki and the Madani Surahs. AsbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l AsbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l, meaning occasions or circumstances of revelation, refers to the historical context in which Quranic verses were revealed. The rhetoric shift in the style of the discourse from 25th ayat shows that the ayaat 25 to 78 were most likely revealed during the month of Zul-Hijjah in the 1st year after Hijrah. This is shown by ayaat 25th to 41 and affirmed by the event of the disclosure of ayaat 39-40. The month of Zul-Hijjah more likely than not brought to the foreigners nostalgic recollections of their homes in Makkah and they probably thought of their Hallowed City and their Hajj congregation there and lamented to believe that the mushrik Quraish had suspended them from visiting the Sacred Mosque. Along these lines, they may even have been appealing to God for and anticipating that Divine authorization should take up arms against those despots who had ousted them from their homes and denied them of visiting the house of Allah and made it hard for them to follow the path for Islam. This thought process and resultant praying of muhajir Muslims adds up to the AsbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l the (context of the revelation). That is the reason for which Masjid-al-Haram was made has been explicitly referenced. It has been made clear that Hajj(pilgrimage) had been ordered for the worship of One Allah. However, it is an incongruity that a short time later it had been committed to the customs of shirk and the worshippers of One Allah had been suspended from visiting it. In this manner, consent for taking up arms against those despots has been given to remove them from that point and to set up the upright lifestyle for setting up prudence and eradicating evil. As indicated by Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Urwah canister Zubair, Zaid receptacle Aslam, Muqatil container Hayyan, Qatadah and other tafsirs, ayat 39 is the 1st ayat that gives the Muslims authorization to take up arms. Assortments of Hadith and books on the life of Muhammad affirm that after this consent real arrangements for war were begun and the very 1st endeavor was sent to the shore of the Red Ocean in Safar A.H. 2, which is known as the Expedition of Waddan or Al- Abwa.Abul A'la Maududi - Tafhim-ul-Quran Topic and theme This Surah addresses: (1) The mushriks of Makkah, (2) the faltering Muslims, and (3) the Genuine Devotees. The mushriks have been cautioned in a mighty way with this impact: \\"You have adamantly and impudently persevered in your thoughts of ignorance and confided in your false-deities rather than Allah, however, they have no force at all and you have denied the Divine Messenger. Resultantly you will meet a similar end as has been the doom of those like you previously. You have just hurt yourselves by dismissing Our Prophet and by aggrieving the best of your own people; your false-deities will not have the option to spare you from the rage of God\\". Simultaneously, they have been advised consistently for their doctrine of shirk and sound contentions have been given for Tauhid and the Hereafter. The faltering Muslims, who entered Islam, yet did not want to face any difficulty in its path, have been advised with this impact: \\"What is this faith of yours? From one viewpoint, you are prepared to have faith in Allah and become His workers given you are harmony and thriving, and if you meet with torments and hardships in His path, you dispose of your Allah and stop to remain His servant. You should remember that this faltering disposition of yours can't deflect those incidents and misfortunes which Allah has appointed for you.\\" As respects the genuine Devotees, they have been tended to in two different ways: (1) in a general route to incorporate the average folks of Arabia additionally, and (2) in an exclusive way: # The Adherents have been informed that the mushriks of Makkah reserved no option to suspend them from visiting the Holy Mosque. They reserved no privilege to keep anybody from performing Hajj because the Holy Mosque was not their personal property. This complaint was advocated as well as went about as a powerful political weapon against the Quraish. For it suggested this conversation starter to different clans of Arabia: Were the Quraish insignificant orderlies of the Blessed Mosque or its proprietors? It suggested that if they prevailing with regards to suspending the Muslims from Hajj with no dissent from others, they would feel urged in the future to suspend from Hajj and Umrah the individuals of whatever other clan or faction, who had stressed relations with the Quraish. To underscore this point, the historical backdrop of the construction of the Sacred Mosque has been referred to show that it was worked by Prophet Abraham by the Order of Allah and he had welcomed all the people groups to perform Hajj there. That is the reason those originating from outside had delighted in equivalent rights by the neighborhood individuals from the earliest starting point. It has likewise been clarified that that House had not been worked for the ceremonies of shirk but for the love of One Allah. Hence it was sheer oppression that the worship of Allah was being prohibited there while the worship of idols appreciated full permit. # To tackle the oppression of the Quraish, the Muslims were permitted to battle with them. They were likewise provided with instruction to adopt the right and just behavior as and when they procured capacity to lead in the land. Additionally, the Adherents have been formally given the name of \\"Muslims\\", saying, \\"You are the genuine heirs of Abraham and you have been chosen to become witnesses of Truth before humankind. In this way, you ought to establish salat and pay the zakat obligations to turn into the best models of equitable life and perform Jihad for spreading the word of Allah.\\"(vv. 41,77, 78.) Principal subject The significant issues, divine laws, and guidance direction in the text of the discourse can be categorized as follows:-Mohammed, A Comprehensive Commentary on the Quran: Comprising Sale‚Äôs Translation and Preliminary Discourse, with Additional Notes and Emendations (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner, and Co., 1896). 4 vols. # A scene from the Hour of Fate. # Human life cycle: life right now and then in the Hereafter. # The conduct of those people who were remaining at the border of faith is recognized. # The way that Allah consistently helps His Rasools. # Divine law conceding equivalent rights to all believers in Masjid-al-Haram, regardless of whether they are locals or outsiders. # The way that Allah Himself distinguished the site and asked Prophet Ibrahim to manufacture the Kaaba and call humanity to perform Hajj. # Somebody who commits Shirk resembles the one who tumbles from the sky and his body is grabbed away by the birds. # It isn't the blood or the tissue of a sacrificed animal that arrives Allah yet the devotion of the person who is offering the sacrifice. # The 1st Instruction of Allah allowing consent to the devotees to shield themselves and battle against the disbelievers and mushrikin. # Upon the arrival of Judgment, Allah Himself will be the Adjudicator for all. # Allah's guarantee to the individuals who relocate for the sake of ALLAH that He will compensate them generously. # Allah called the devotees Muslims in the earlier sacred writings and in The Qur'an as well.

Mangaore (5 kilometres east) is the residential township for the nearby Mangahao hydro-electric power station, which was the second power station to be built in New Zealand and the first to be built by the government. The power station is the oldest still supplying power to New Zealand grid. The Manawatu River lies to the west of the town. Shannon originally adjoined extensive swamps and was a headquarters for flax milling. The land on which the township later stood was part of an endowment of acquired about 1881 by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company (WMR). At first the company had intended to extend its railway from Levin to Foxton, but afterwards it proceeded to develop and open up the endowment area. Accordingly, the line was laid along the present route via Shannon. The town is considered to have been founded on 8 March 1887 when the first auction of town land was held. Shannon was named after George Vance Shannon (1842‚Äì1920), a director of the WMR. It was constituted a borough in 1917.Shannon in the 1966 Encyclopaedia of New Zealand Shannon Railway Station is the most substantial of only a few remaining physical relics of the WMR, which was acquired by the national New Zealand Railways Department in 1908. The station is a stop for the Capital Connection long distance commuter train between Wellington and Palmerston North. Today Shannon sits as a passing through point between Palmerston North and Wellington with two cafes, a dairy, an RD1 rural supply store, a pub, a fish and chips shop, a primary school, a Four Square grocer, a petrol station, a native bird and wildlife park, and an art gallery. The township also has a strong rugby team and several netball teams. A large percentage of the population is MƒÅori with the local primary school being somewhat MƒÅori-orientated.

He committed suicide while awaiting the end of the main trial without giving a full confession, leaving the extent of his crimes and motives largely unknown. Early life Little is known about Carl Gro√ümann's early life, except that he had sadistic sexual tastes and had several convictions for child molestation. As a young man, he served a 15-year prison sentence for fondling a ten-year-old girl and for brutally raping a four-year-old girl (who died shortly after the judgement). . During World War I, Gro√ümann sold meat on the black market and even had a hotdog stand at a train station near his home. Some believed the meat contained the remains of his victims, as he threw some of their bones and other inedible parts into the river. Pieces of missing women were found in the canal near Andreas Square and off the Luisenstadt Canal, sometimes on a daily basis, which led some investigators to suspect that Gro√ümann murdered up to 100 women and girls. Arrest On 21 August 1921, Gro√ümann was arrested at his apartment in Berlin after neighbours heard screams and banging noises, followed by silence. The police burst into the apartment, finding on the bed the body of a young woman who had recently been murdered. Gro√ümann was taken into custody and charged with first degree murder. Neighbours reported that he seemed to have had a steady supply of female companions, mostly destitute-looking young women, over the previous few years. Many went into the apartment, but few emerged from it. How many lives Gro√ümann took is not known. Only the body of his final victim was found, along with bloodstains in the apartment that indicated at least three other persons had been butchered in the few weeks leading up to his arrest. One 1921 report claims Gro√ümann had confessed to about twenty murders over twenty years. A 1922 report claims that Gro√ümann had admitted to killing four women. Some have suggested as many as 50 women entered Gro√ümann's apartment and ended up being murdered and dismembered. Gro√ümann was not convicted of murder, because he hanged himself in his prison cell before the end of the main trial.

Stretching from the northern Horowhenua around Levin in the south to Marton in the north, this great triangular area of low-lying land extends inland from the South Taranaki Bight almost as far as Ashhurst at the mouth of the Manawatu Gorge, and covers an area of around . In the south, around Lake Horowhenua, the plains were once an extensive wetland, which has been largely drained and turned into profitable dairy farming land. There are conservation moves in progress to restore some of these wetlands to their former state. Further north, the plains provide the basis for the economy which drives the city of Palmerston North and the towns of Foxton, Feilding and Bulls, all of which rely on the agricultural dollar to an extent. As floodplains, the land is not always entirely dry land, and although the area receives slightly below the national average rainfall, floods can occur, as happened most recently around the township of Tangimoana in early 2004.

Created by Shigeru Miyamoto, he first appeared in the Nintendo Entertainment System video game Super Mario Bros., where he dropped enemies called Spinies on the stage. He has a striped green shell, wears aviator goggles, and rides around in a smiling cloud. He has since appeared in several main Mario titles since, as well as Mario spin-off titles, notably the Mario Kart series where he acts as the referee and a playable character in Mario Kart 7, Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart Tour. He has appeared in non-Mario titles, including the Super Smash Bros. series as an assist trophy in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Since appearing in Super Mario Bros., Lakitu has received somewhat positive reception. It has appeared in the form of several kinds of merchandise, including on t-shirts, stickers, and a dry erase board. While he has been regarded as one of the best Mario villains by GameDaily, he has been decried by several editors for being a troublesome enemy, including 1UP.com editor Jeremy Parish and G4TV editor Andrew Pfister. Concept and description Lakitu is a Koopa who rides in a cloud and drops creatures called Spinies on the ground. It has a green turtle shell and yellow skin like most Koopas, but is differentiated by a thick pair of glasses (or goggles) and a different shell design. Its cloud \\"vehicle\\" has a smiling face on it. Lakitus come in several varieties as well. Some Lakitus can be seen coming out of pipes, while others use a fishing pole for a variety of things, such as holding a 1-Up Mushroom or a traffic light (in Mario Kart games). An early variation of the Lakitu features Lakitu riding a plane. Lakitus frequently also utilize the ability to produce electricity. A variation of the Lakitu is the Fishin' Boo, a ghost that rides a cloud. Mario series creator Shigeru Miyamoto commented that Lakitu was the game character who represented him best. He described Lakitu as \\"very free, floating in the air, going anywhere. And that's me, that is.\\" The Spinies that it drops are typically red turtles with spikes on their backs that hatch from \\"Spiny Eggs.\\" Appearances Lakitu's first appearance in Super Mario Bros., throwing Spinies at Mario. Lakitu first appeared in Super Mario Bros. for the NES, where it appears as an enemy that drops Spiny Eggs, which hatch into Spinies when they hit the ground or players. While Lakitu did not make an appearance in the western Super Mario Bros. 2, he did appear in the third game Super Mario Bros. 3; besides being an enemy, its cloud appears as an item called \\"Jugem's Cloud\\" that the player- character can use to skip levels. An enemy bearing a resemblance to Lakitu called Roketon appears in Super Mario Land for the Game Boy, where it uses a plane. In Super Mario World for the Super NES, its cloud can be stolen by the player-character and used as a flying vehicle for a period of time. Lakitu made an appearance in Yoshi's Island, where it had several variations, including the first occurrence of an electricity-producing Lakitu. Super Mario 64 and its DS remake features two characters called the \\"Lakitu Bros.\\" in a friendly capacity, where they act as the cameramen for the player to control during Mario's adventure. However, Lakitus appear as enemies as well. It would not appear in a primary Mario title afterward until New Super Mario Bros., which featured a boss encounter with a Lakitu called \\"Lakithunder\\". Lakitu also appeared in his very own minigame called \\"Lakitu Launch\\", where players throw Spiny Shells at the baskets Lakitu is holding within thirty seconds. It appeared in New Super Mario Bros. Wii in roughly the same capacity as in New Super Mario Bros. Most recently, it appeared in Super Mario Galaxy 2, with a boss encounter called \\"Giga Lakitu.\\" He also appeared in New Super Mario Bros. U and its DLC New Super Luigi U as well as Yoshi's New Island. In Super Mario Odyssey, Lakitus with fishing rods can be found in various kingdoms, and can be captured by Mario in order to fish in ponds. Lakitu has a prominent role in the Mario Kart series since its debut in 1992 with Super Mario Kart. In addition to his appearance in Mario Kart 7, Mario Kart 8http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/12/mario_kart_arcade_gp_dx_adds_lakitu_to_the_race_lineup, and Mario Kart Tour as a playable driver, he is a prominent non-playable character as the referee, where he is holding a traffic light hanging on a fishing pole to signal when to start the race (except for Mario Kart DS and Mario Kart Tour), tells them which lap or section they're on, and waving the checkered flag to declare a winner at the finish line. This is also true for other games, where it acts in various assistant roles, such as an umpire in the Mario Baseball games and an official in the Mario Tennis games. He also starts every match in Mario Hoops 3-on-3 and Mario Sports Mix. He also acts as the cameraman in Super Mario 64 and its DS remake. Each game in the Mario role-playing games has featured a Lakitu, starting with Super Mario RPG. A playable Paper Lakitu appears in the first Paper Mario game called Lakilester. While he acts antagonistically towards Paper Mario, it eventually joins him after his girlfriend, Lakilulu, convinces him. The playable Lakitu in Mario Kart 7, Mario Kart 8, and Mario Kart Tour has a red shell, though the differences between red and green shelled Lakitus are unknown. Lakitu has also made appearances in the Super Smash Bros. series starting with the original Super Smash Bros. as a cameo where he can be seen in the background of the stage Peach's Castle, his design is taken from Super Mario 64. Lakitu returns in Super Smash Bros. Melee once again appearing in the background of a stage. this time being Yoshi's Island where his design is taken directly from Super Mario World, and is featured as one of the 293 obtainable trophies in the game. Lakitu also appeared in Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U as an assist trophy in the form of his 8-bit Super Mario Bros. design, while appearing as a common enemy in the Smash Run mode in the Nintendo 3DS version. He appears again in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, where he is a spirit that can be fought, along with his Spinies. It also appeared in The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap as an enemy. In the Mario Party series, he appears in various minigames and in Mario Party Advance, he is the referee with his whistle-blowing cloud. In Super Mario Maker with its 3DS remake and Super Mario Maker 2, Lakitu can be customized to throw other objects, such as coins, power-ups and even other enemies; his cloud can be ridden on by the player after he has been defeated and by shaking the Lakitu in the level editor it will be tossed away leaving the cloud empty, that can be ridden or used to carry power-ups, cannons or certain enemies. =In other media= Lakitu has appeared several times in other media. The Nintendo DSi app \\"DSi Sound\\" featured a Mario theme that had Lakitu producing coins in it while playing a song. It originally appeared in the anime movie Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen! as an antagonist. It again appeared in the episode of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! called \\"Mario and the Red Baron Koopa\\", where its appearance differs from its traditional appearance, featuring green skin and red sunglasses.

It has appeared in the form of several kinds of merchandise, including on t-shirts, stickers, dry erase board and a figurine. 1UP.com described Lakitu as a \\"series mainstay.\\" Official Nintendo Magazine editor Chris Scullion listed Lakitu as one of the unsung Nintendo heroes, commenting that while it, like Birdo, does get some recognition, it is less so than other enemies such as the Goomba and the Koopa Troopa. GameDaily listed Lakitu as the sixth best Mario enemy, describing him as \\"cute\\" and \\"friendly,\\" yet also \\"a pain\\" for players to beat. In discussing an independent video game called Explodemon, video game developer Jonathan Biddle called the \\"Bomber\\" enemy from Explodemon a rip-off of Lakitu. GameSpy editor Jonti Davies made a comparison between Telly Vision from Chibi-Robo!, who acts as a flying companion to the protagonist. In his review of the Virtual Console re-release of Super Mario Bros., GameSpot editor Jeff Gerstmann stated that Lakitus \\"are still awesome.\\" G4TV editor Yodapollo listed Lakitu's first appearance as one of the \\"Epic Fail Videogame Levels,\\" commenting that he \\"cannot come up with a single other videogame character who comes close to being half as annoying as Lakitu.\\" G4TV editor Andrew Pfister called Lakitu's first appearance as one of the memorable moments of Super Mario Bros. He also referenced its appearance in one of the later levels as being a difficult encounter. In his retrospective of Super Mario Bros. 2, 1UP.com editor Jeremy Parish commented that after \\"being harrassed [sic] endlessly by that jackass Lakitu, it was a relief to be able to hop onto Pidgit's magic carpet and swipe it right out from under his feet.\\" In discussing the challenges of Super Mario Bros., 1UP.com stated that the Spinies were never a \\"welcome sight\\", due to appearing in \\"infinite numbers courtesy of that rat bastard Lakitu, a cowardly bespectacled turtle who hovered on a cloud overhead tossing Spiny eggs at Mario.\\" It was also described by IGN's Audrey Drake as one of the best Mario enemies, stating that \\"Are they evil, spiny-tossing fiends out to destroy the Mushroom Kingdom? Are they RTVF dropouts whose day job is following Mario around with a camera? Or are they racing fans, always around to lend a hand to a fallen kart racer? Whatever they are, they've certainly contributed a lot to the Mushroom Kingdom through their various jobs.\\" In criticizing some of the game design choices in Yoshi's Island DS, NGamer criticized an appearance by Lakitu, where when it knocks Baby Mario off of Yoshi, players have to jump into Lakitu to get him back, thereby losing Baby Mario again. UGO Networks editor Chris Littler listed having to be rescued by Lakitu after falling off the track in Super Mario Kart as one of the top 50 worst ways to die in a video game. Shacknews praised the pixel art used in Super Smash Bros. Brawl for Lakitu. In discussing the quality of the Hammer Bros., CNET editor Nate Lanxon commented that \\"when preparing defenses for your forts of the future, you can take your grumpy little mushroom things and Lakitu's lame cloud,\\" showing preference to Hammer Bros. Editor Scott Jones listed Lakitu and its cloud as an uncomfortable pairing, joking that \\"if that cloud ever gets free of Lakitu, it will need many years of therapy just to feel like a normal cloud again.\\" The parody film There Will Be Brawl features an \\"Ira Glass-esque\\" Lakitu, resembling a human more than a turtle.

It was established in 1992 as the South African Rugby Football Union, from the merger of the South African Rugby Board and the non-racial South African Rugby Union (SACOS), and took up its current name in 2005. SARU organises several national teams, most notably the senior national side, the Springboks. History The South African Rugby Board was the rugby union governing body of white South Africans between 1889 and 1992. The governing of white and coloured rugby union was handled separately during South Africa under Apartheid. On 23 March 1992 the non- racial South African Rugby Union and the South African Rugby Board were merged to form the South African Rugby Football Union. The unified body changed its name in 2005 to the current South African Rugby Union. The debacle of the 2003 World Cup saw the Springboks exit in the quarterfinals. Further, SARU experienced the scandal of Kamp Staaldraad, the training camp run by then-Boks coach Rudolf Straeuli. Straeuli resigned, as did Rian Oberholzer, the managing director of South Africa Rugby (Pty) Ltd, the commercial arm of SARFU. Soon afterwards, SARFU president Silas Nkununu, facing a strong reelection challenge, withdrew from consideration for election. Brian van Rooyen was elected president of SARU in 2004. He soon became a highly polarising figure in South African sport, with detractors accusing him of financial shenanigans, favouritism, and general mismanagement. His management style was also widely perceived as autocratic. One of the major gripes against the van Rooyen administration was the allocation of Springboks home test matches. The KwaZulu-Natal union and the Free State union did not receive a Tri Nations Test in either 2005 or 2006. Both unions, vocal opponents of van Rooyen, accused him of punishing them for their opposition. However, the biggest bone of contention surrounded the expansion of the Super Rugby competition. SANZAR, a consortium of the South African, Australian, and New Zealand governing bodies, expanded their Super 12 competition to 14 teams, a change that took effect in 2006. South Africa was entitled to add one franchise to the four from the Super 12 era. In a controversial move, the Southern Spears franchise was assured a place in the 2007 and 2008 competitions, with an increasingly unpopular promotion/relegation system established to keep the total of South African Super 14 teams at its allotted five. Van Rooyen was widely viewed as being responsible for this arrangement, which was generally opposed by the existing Super 12/14 sides. The South African government attempted to step in to address perceived problems within van Rooyen's administration, but he survived two years of attempts to oust him. Finally, at the 2006 SARU General Meeting, van Rooyen was voted out in favour of Oregan Hoskins, who immediately promised a more decentralised management style. Shortly after the election, it was alleged that van Rooyen had offered a bribe of ZAR 3 million (US$485,000) plus a Springboks test against France to the Free State union in exchange for the union changing its vote in the presidential election in his favour. Hoskins soon announced that a planned investigation into van Rooyen's administration would go forward. As for the Spears issue, the SARU Presidents' Council issued a recommendation on 24 March that SA Rugby revisit the decision to admit the Spears. On 19 April, the decision to admit the Spears was officially overturned.

He was also in Lucha Libre USA (LLUSA), where he held the Tag Team Championship with Jon Rekon. He was also known by his nickname \\"The Canadian Destroyer\\", a reference to his front flip piledriver finishing move of the same name. Professional wrestling career = Early career (2002‚Äì2004) = Williams was trained alongside Chris Sabin by Scott D'Amore at the Can-Am Wrestling School. Williams debuted in D'Amore's Windsor, Ontario-based Border City Wrestling promotion in 2002. He spent the next four years working on the independent circuit in Canada for Border City Wrestling, Blood, Sweat and Ears and in the Northern United States for promotions such as NWA Cyberspace and Pro Wrestling Guerrilla. =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling= Team Canada (2004‚Äì2006) Williams debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling on February 25, 2004, a member of Team Canada. He and the remainder of Team Canada took part in the TNA 2004 World X Cup Tournament, but were defeated by Team Mexico and Team USA. On August 11, 2004, Williams won the X Division Championship in a twenty-two man Gauntlet for the Gold match, entering at number eleven and pinning The Amazing Red to win the bout. Early in his title reign, Williams claimed that the Canadian Destroyer could not be countered. According to Williams, Bully Ray told him to focus the entire match in his finishing move. However, after Williams successfully retained the title in a match with A.J. Styles at Victory Road on November 7, 2004, Chris Sabin began claiming that he was capable of countering the move. He went on to counter the Canadian Destroyer into his own finishing move, the \\"Cradle Shock\\", on three occasions in the month following Victory Road. However, Sabin was unable to defeat Williams for the X Division Championship at Turning Point on December 5, 2004. Williams's reign would last for five months and five days, (which would become the longest X Division title reign until Christopher Daniels won the title in 2005), before ending on January 16, 2005 at Final Resolution, where he was defeated by A.J. Styles in an Ultimate X match that also featured Sabin.

They challenged then-champions The Naturals at Slammiversary on June 19, 2005, but were once again defeated. Williams returned to the X Division on July 17, 2005 at No Surrender, unsuccessfully challenging X Division Champion Christopher Daniels. Williams, along with the rest of Team Canada, would go on to join Planet Jarrett upon TNA's debut on Spike TV in October 2005. After winning an Ultimate X match at Bound for Glory on October 23, Williams received a title shot against A.J. Styles at Genesis on November 13, but was again defeated. Williams would resume wrestling in the X Division and faced off against Chris Sabin, Elix Skipper, Shark Boy, Puma and Chase Stevens in an Xscape Match at Lockdown. Williams and Sabin were the final two competitors, but Williams lost after Sabin was able to climb over the cage and escape. Williams again acted as the captain of Team Canada in the 2006 World X Cup Tournament. He lost to Jushin Thunder Liger at Sacrifice in a Captain vs. Captain semifinal match, but won the Gauntlet Match final to tie the points with Team USA. On the following edition of Impact!, he lost to Team USA captain Chris Sabin in a tiebreaker singles match. On the June 29 episode of Impact!, Jim Cornette announced that Team Canada would be disbanded immediately. However, they were given one last chance to stay intact if they won a match a week later against Jay Lethal, Rhino, and Team 3D. Team Canada lost the match when Lethal pinned A-1, officially disbanding Team Canada once and for all. On the July 27 edition of Impact!, Williams won an X Division four-way match by defeating Sonjay Dutt, Johnny Devine, and Shark Boy after hitting Shark Boy with the Canadian Destroyer. On the following week's Impact!, he defeated Jay Lethal, Sonjay Dutt, Kazarian and Alex Shelley and became the number one contender to the X Division Championship. At Hard Justice, Williams challenged the X Division Champion Senshi in a triple threat match also involving Jay Lethal. During the match, Williams used the Canadian Destroyer on Lethal and was about to attempt a pinfall until Senshi dropkicked Williams out of the ring and pinned Lethal to retain his championship. Various feuds (2006‚Äì2007) Williams was invited to watch The Latin American Xchange burn the American flag during the November 16 edition of Impact!, but he would make his first face turn after refusing to torch the flag. Williams was then involved in the feud between America's Most Wanted and the Latin American Xchange. At Genesis, Homicide had Gail Kim set up for Da Gringo Killa, but Williams came in with a lead pipe to make the save. On the following Impact!, Williams was later named as Kurt Angle's tag team partner to face LAX for the NWA World Tag Team Championship, but he was ambushed before the match by LAX. Samoa Joe would then replace Williams as Angle's partner. On the following week, Williams would go one on one against Homicide and defeated him via roll-up. After the match though, Homicide, Hernandez and Konnan started to beat down Williams followed by Hernandez hitting him with the Border Toss. AMW would then come out to make the save and then steal the Mexican flag. At Turning Point, Williams came out to help AMW in their flag match against LAX. During the match, he attempted the Canadian Destroyer on Konnan, but he was stopped by Hernandez. On the December 14 edition of Impact!, the LAX defeated AMW in a title vs. team match after James Storm hit Chris Harris with a beer bottle, permanently disbanding AMW. After AMW's dissolution, their former manager Gail Kim became Williams' valet. The two later faced and were defeated by James Storm and Jacqueline Moore at Against All Odds. Petey soon split from Kim and then became involved in a storyline with former Team Canada partners Eric Young and Robert Roode as Williams' tried to help Young get out of a contract that Roode had Young signed to. The feud continued until Lockdown, where Williams faced Roode. Despite using a hockey stick, Williams was pinned by Roode after a Payoff to win the match. He later competed in the Ultimate X match at Victory Road, but was the second competitor eliminated from the match. Soon after, he remained completely unseen on television. On the October 25 edition of Impact!, he participated in a fatal four way X Division style match against Havok, Sonjay Dutt and Shark Boy, but the match went to a no-contest after Team 3D interfered and put both Williams and Havok through tables. On the November 1 edition of Impact!, Williams and the entire X Division attacked Team 3D. Petey Williams at Lockdown 2007. Maple Leaf Muscle (2007‚Äì2008) After the feud between the X Division and Team 3D died down, Williams began talking about bodybuilding and was often working out during interviews and referring to himself as \\"Little Poppa Pump\\". At Turning Point, he won one of the briefcases in the Feast or Fired match. Scott Steiner, who also won one of the briefcases, would later trade cases with Williams, which unintentionally gave Petey a World Heavyweight Championship shot in the process. In subsequent matches, Williams would bring down the briefcase to the ring and place it near the turnbuckle. During one of his matches, Steiner entered the arena and switched Petey's world title match briefcase with the original X Division Championship match briefcase. During a tag team match with Williams and Steiner against The Rock 'n Rave Infection, Steiner stole both cases and left him to be pinned by Jimmy Rave. Williams and Steiner faced off at Against All Odds with the winner getting both briefcases. Steiner would go on to win the match and officially claim both briefcases. On the following Impact!, Williams once again came up short against Steiner, but after the match Steiner showed Williams respect. Following this, Williams formed a team with Steiner and acquired the managerial services of Rhaka Khan in the process. Upon forming their alliance, Steiner and Khan put Williams through numerous initiations to prove himself worthy of their team. Williams and Steiner faced the Motor City Machine Guns in a tag team match, Petey won after pinning Alex Shelley. After the match, Williams had one more initiation to complete. Rhaka Khan brought out a black bag that contained a pair of scissors and a shaver. Steiner then cut and shaved Williams' hair, and gave him a chainlink headdress similar to Steiner's, cementing Williams' heel turn in the process. This also gave emphasis to the nickname \\"Little Petey Pump\\", a variation of Steiner's \\"Big Poppa Pump\\" nickname. Williams later competed in the \\"Cuffed in the Cage\\" match at Lockdown, but lost to the eventual winner Eric Young. On the April 17 edition of Impact!, Steiner gave him the X Division title shot briefcase. Later in the same episode, after Jay Lethal's match against Johnny Devine, Williams attacked Lethal from behind, cashed in the title shot and won his second X Division Championship. Two weeks later at a taping of Impact!, Williams' orbital bone was fractured during a match. However, Williams recovered from his injury and returned at Slammiversary to successfully defend his title against Kaz and again on the Impact! after Slammiversary. At Hard Justice, Williams retained his X Division Championship against Consequences Creed due to interference from Sheik Abdul Bashir. At No Surrender on September 14, he lost the X Division title in a triple threat match after Bashir pinned Consequences Creed. Upon losing his title, Williams had a face turn when he was attacked by Bashir as well as The Rock 'n Rave Infection. Williams would then participate in the Steel Asylum Match at Bound for Glory IV, but came up short as Jay Lethal won. The Frontline (2008‚Äì2009) Williams as \\"Little Petey Pump\\" during a show in London, Ontario in 2008 On the October 30 edition of Impact!, Williams along with A.J. Styles, Samoa Joe, Jay Lethal, Consequences Creed, Eric Young, O.D.B. and The Motor City Machine Guns formed a faction of younger wrestlers, known as The Frontline, to oppose The Main Event Mafia (Sting, Kurt Angle, Kevin Nash, Booker T and Sharmell). Later that night, Scott Steiner returned from his injury, attacked Williams' allies and joined the Main Event Mafia. Unlike the rest of the MEM, Steiner spared Williams from a beating. On the November 13 edition of Impact!, after seemingly being in-between the two sides, Williams suffered a beating at the hands of the Main Event Mafia, which included Steiner tossing Williams off a ladder and busting him open and as a result, ended his affiliation with Williams thus turning Williams into a face character. Williams returned on the January 15 edition of Impact! attacking Scott Steiner while referee Earl Hebner was distracted by guest enforcer Mick Foley. Williams cost Steiner the match with a missile dropkick leading to AJ Styles hitting the Pel√© on Steiner for the win. Williams and AJ embraced after the match. Williams would go on to lose to Steiner at Against All Odds, and once again on the following Impact! in a \\"Head Dress on a Pole\\" match, effectively ending their feud. In January 2009, TNA informed Williams that the company would not renew his contract that was expiring later that month. Williams wrestled his last match for the company on February 10, at the tapings of the February 19 edition of Impact!, when he teamed with former Team Canada partner Eric Young to take on Beer Money, Inc. for the World Tag Team Title.

Gerlings, Hey, Diddle, Diddle and Other Best-Loved Rhymes (Windmill Books, 2009), p. 32. Origins The superstition of hoping for wishes granted when seeing a shooting or falling star may date back to the ancient world. Wishing on the first star seen may also predate this rhyme, which first began to be recorded in late nineteenth-century America.R. Webster, The Encyclopedia of Superstitions (Llewellyn Worldwide, 2008), p. 245. The song and tradition seem to have reached Britain by the early twentieth century and have since spread worldwide.I. Opie and M. Tatem, A Dictionary of Superstitions (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989), pp. 175-6. In popular culture The rhyme was turned into a song in Abbott and Costello's \\"In the Navy\\". The character Russ Raymond sang it in the beginning of the movie. The Angel in \\"The Bishop's Wife\\" (film, 1947, with Cary Grant, Loretta Young, David Niven and Monty Woolley) quotes the first line and tells the Bishop's Wife that she should make a wish.

Pseudolites are most often small transceivers that are used to create a local, ground-based Global Positioning System (GPS) alternative. The range of each transceiver's signal is dependent on the power available to the unit. Being able to deploy one's own positioning system, independent of the GPS, can be useful in situations where the normal GPS signals are either blocked/jammed (military conflicts), or simply not available (exploration of other planets). Pseudolites are normally used to augment the GPS by improving dilution of precision (DOP). Or pseudolites are also used to implement GPS- like indoor location systems, where pseudolites are acting as GPS satellites. Pseudolites use cheap voltage controlled oscillator, so pseudolite based location system shall provide a methodology to compensate clock differences among pseudolites. For planetary exploration, research being conducted at facilities including NASA Ames Research Center and Stanford University (see link at bottom) may allow a rover to deploy an array of pseudolites with no particular accuracy and still calibrate the system to centimeter-level resolution without human assistance. This would aid a rover's path-finding routines and increase the safe maneuvering speed of the unassisted vehicle. The concept is sometimes referred to as a Self-Calibrating Pseudolite Array (SCPA). Other applications of pseudolite arrays include precision approach landing systems for aircraft and highly accurate tracking of transponders.

Located in the namesake Sibuyan Sea, it has an area of . The island has two prominent peaks, Mount Guiting-Guiting with a height of and Mount Nailog with a height of . The people speak the Sibuyanon dialect of Romblomanon, a Visayan language. Sibuyan has been dubbed by some local and international natural scientists as \\"the Gal√°pagos of Asia\\", because it has remained in isolation from the rest of the world since its formation. Never in its geological history has it ever been connected with any part of the Philippine archipelago. Seismic forces pushed up a peak from the earth‚Äôs crust, forming a series of smaller peaks and slopes. The peak is Mt. Guiting-Guiting (literally means \\"the saw-toothed mountain\\", in reference to its jagged ridge). Because of the steep slopes, much of its original forest remains untouched, and the rest is the island as we find it today. Primary forests cover , which is 33% of the land area of Sibuyan. However, most of the lower altitude forest has been logged or is secondary. Mt. Guiting-guiting Natural Park (equivalent to the IUCN category of National Park) was established to protect these forests, which are mainly in the centre and north of the island, and covers an area of out of Sibuyan‚Äôs total area of . The park features a scenic landscape with twin towering peaks set amidst closed canopy forests. Its forests remain largely intact, and include the entire elevational gradient from lowland dipterocarp forest (at 200 to 900 m) and mangroves, through montane forest (above 700 m) to mossy forest, heathland and montane grassland around the peaks. Political subdivision Romblon province map locating Sibuyan island The island is shared by three municipalities; Cajidiocan, Magdiwang, and San Fernando. Biodiversity Nepenthes sibuyanensis from Mount Guiting-Guiting Sibuyan has a rich biodiversity of flora and fauna which are threatened by an emerging aggressive promotion of mining industry by the country's government. Exact figures on numbers of total plant species are hard to give, as biologists stumble upon species yet unidentified by the scientific community. In one study, the National Museum identified 1,551 trees in a single hectare, with 123 species of trees, and of this number, 54 are found nowhere else in the world. Hence, it has been proclaimed as one of the world‚Äôs most diverse and dense forests.Towards sustainable forest management and poverty alleviation in the Philippines. A case study on institutional constraints and possibilities in pursuing sustainable forest management and livelihood means on Sibuyan Island, the Philippines There are estimated to be 700 vascular plant species on the island. Nepenthes sibuyanensis, a pitcher plant species, is also endemic as its scientific name suggests. There are 131 species of birds and ten species of fruit bats, and many dwelling mammals, reptiles, and rodents yet to be fully catalogued. Three birds subspecies are endemic to Sibuyan: the Philippine hanging parrot (Loriculus philippensis bournsi), the Philippine Pygmy-woodpecker (Dendrocopos maculatus menagei), and the Orange-bellied Flowerpecker (Dicaeum trigonostigma sibuyanicum), all of which were recorded there in the early 1990s. Five species of threatened mammals, one fruit bat and four rodents, are endemic to Sibuyan, and the endangered fruit bat Nyctimene rabori occurs there. Current environmental issue Sibuyan Island has been said to be one of the most unspoiled ecosystems in the Philippines and the world. The water of the Cantingas River as well as most of the other smaller rivers and rivulets on the island was tested to be one of the best water quality for human consumption worldwide. The drinking water of Sibuyanons come direct and untreated from rivers, springs and holes drilled at mountain slopes or from the ground. The Sibuyanons Against Mining advocacy group, with the Sibuyan Island Sentinels League for Environment Inc. (Sibuyan ISLE),Official website has been fighting for the conservation and protection of the island against mining activities considering its vast impact on the ecology, culture and society of the island. Other events On June 21, 2008, the passenger ferry MV Princess of the Stars of Sulpicio Lines (now Philippine Span Asia Carrier Corp.) capsized off the coast of the island. The vessel was sailing through the Sibuyan Strait from Manila en route to Cebu City in the height of Typhoon Frank. That accident have caused the death of hundreds of people.

Guiting-Guiting, in the local Romblomanon dialect, means \\"jagged\\". The mountain is one of the focal points of Sibuyan's declaration as a biodiversity haven. The entire island has been compared numerous times with the biodiversity endemism rate of the Galapagos islands. This endemism prompted much of the mountain and its slopes to be protected under the Mt. Guiting- Guiting Natural Park, established in 1996. The park also encompasses nearby Mt. Nailog (789 masl) to the west. Hiking The summit of Mt. Guiting- Guiting as viewed from Mayo's Peak. The narrow ridge connecting the two in the foreground is known to the climbing community as the Knife Edge. It is often referred to as Mount G2, although the nickname is not accepted by the locals as it disrespects the indigenous name of the sacred site. The mountain is open all year round for hiking. Two trails currently exist: the Tampayan Trail from the north, and the Olango Trail from the south. Hiking permits and guides are secured from the DENR office in Magdiwang town. The entire upper trails consist of exposed, broken, and sharp ultramafic rocks and boulders. The summit area of Mt. Guiting-Guiting is primarily a heath land and grassland with exposed rocks on the serrated ridges of the peak. Though the length and duration of the climb is relatively shorter, two days to climb up and one day to descend, this mountain is still acknowledged as the most difficult and technically challenging Philippine mountain to climb, alongside with Mount Halcon in Mindoro and Mount Mantalingajan in Palawan. = History = In May 1982, under the leadership of Arturo Valdez, a joint team from the Bacolod- based Philippine Mountaineering Society (PMS) and the University of the Philippines (UP), the team assaulted the mountain, the attempt of which was to be the first in history. It was during this expedition that one of the peaks, now known as \\"Mayo's Peak\\" was named after one of the team members, Mayo Monteza, who celebrated his birthday during the climb, while one of the water spring sources now known as \\"Bulod's Spring\\" was named after one of the local guides, Bulod, who volunteered (along with another locals) to join the climb. The team failed to take the summit on this first attempt, but came back two weeks afterwards. On 17 June 1982, four climbers became the first to stand at the summit. Their names are Mon Ruiz, Kim Valino, Roel Tan Torres (of UP mountaineers) and Edwin Gatia of the PMS team.  Biodiversity  alt= Sibuyan Island has extremely high endemism largely due to its remoteness. More than half of the Island is covered with forest. Preliminary reports include that the forest density in Sibuyan is 1,551 trees per hectare making it the densest forest ever recorded in the Philippines. There exists a full range of forest gradient in the Philippines consisting of mangrove, lowland, montane, mossy forests, heathland, and grassland‚Äîfrom the shoreline up to the summit of Mt. Guiting-Guiting, There are approximately 700 vascular plant species, including 54 species that are endemic to the island. These include Nepenthes sibuyanensis; Nepenthes argentii; Heterospathe sibuyanensis Becc. (Bil-is), Agamyla sibuyanensis (Sibuyan lipstick plant); Myrmephytum beccarii Elmer (Sibuyan ant plant); Begonia gitingensis Elmer (Guiting-guiting begonia). A total of 130 species of birds have been recorded in the park, of which 102 are either known or presumed to be breeding residents. There are also nine (9) native non-flying terrestrial mammal species, nine fruit bats species, of which one is endemic, and nine (9) lizards and geckos.

Viking Press ‚Äì precedes Canadian edition) Beautiful Losers is the second and final novel by Canadian writer and musician Leonard Cohen. It was published in 1966, before he began his career as a singer- songwriter. Set in the Canadian province of Quebec, the story of 17th-century Mohawk saint Catherine Tekakwitha is interwoven with a love triangle between an unnamed anglophone Canadian folklorist; his Native wife, Edith, who has committed suicide; and his best friend, the mystical F, a Member of Parliament and a leader in the Quebec separatist movement. The complex novel makes use of a vast range of literary techniques, and a wealth of allusion, imagery, and symbolism. It is filled with the mysticism, radicalism, sexuality, and drug- taking emblematic of the 1960s era, and is noted for its linguistic, technical, and sexual excesses. Cohen wrote the novel in two eight-month spurts while living on the Greek island of Hydra in 1964 and 1965. He fasted and consumed amphetamines to focus his creativity on the novel. Despite a lavish rollout, sales were disappointing, and critics were initially unsympathetic or hostile. The book gained critical and commercial attention only after Cohen had given up novel-writing and turned to the songwriting and performing upon which his fame rests today. Beautiful Losers has come to be seen as having introduced postmodernism into Canadian literature. It has become a steady seller, and is considered a part of the Canadian literary canon. Overview The novel reflects the zeitgeist of the 1960s. While its prose is simple, the book itself is difficult, and dense in imagery and symbolism. It is broken into three \\"books\\", each with a different narrator: the historian (called \\"I.\\" by critics) is the narrator of book one, \\"The History of Them All\\", which is the longest book; \\"A Long Letter from F.\\" makes up the second book, a letter from F. to the narrator of the first book; and the third book is narrated by an unnamed third person, and is called \\"Beautiful Losers: An Epilogue in the Third Person\\". =Synopsis= At the centre of the novel are the members of a love triangle, united by their obsessions and fascination with a 17th-century Mohawk, Saint Catherine Tekakwitha. The triangle is made up of the unnamed narrator, an authority on the vanishing A‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî tribe; his wife Edith, one of the last surviving members of the tribe; and their maniacal and domineering friend, \\"F.\\", who may or may not exist. Book one opens with an unnamed anglophone Canadian narrator asking \\"Who are you, Catherine Tekakwitha?\\" The narrator's wife hides in an elevator shaft, intending to have her husband kill her when she comes home. Her plan misfires somewhat, however‚Äîit is a delivery boy, instead, who fatally takes the elevator. The narrator and F. console each other in bed over Edith's death. The narrator and F. attend a demonstration in Montreal's \\"Parc Lafontaine Park\\", where I. gets so caught up in the nationalistic Qu√©b√©cois that he joins in himself, shouting, \\"Fuck the English!\\" The narrator flees to the treehouse F. has left him in his will. Book two consists of a letter composed by F., intended to be read five years after his death by the narrator of book one. As such, chronologically it takes place before book one. F. escapes the asylum he is in and makes for the treehouse he will leave for the narrator of the first book. F. is cared for in an insane asylum by nurse Mary Voolnd, of the A‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî as was Edith. The letter is written in the occupational therapy room of the hospital. Book three opens with a figure in a treehouse, with burnt fingers like the first book's narrator, but also missing a thumb, as F. did after blowing up the statue of Queen Victoria. He is being hunted down as an escaped inmate and terrorist. He is given a ride by a blond woman wearing moccasins, who calls herself Isis, in Greek. Primary characters Painting of Catherine Tekakwitha; one of the primary characters in the novel Themes Francophone F. is a leader in the Quebec separatist movement (Quebec in red). Sex plays a major role in the novel, though the sex scenes tend to be oral or masturbatory. Homosexuality and bisexuality are prominent. Natives are seen as being displaced by the French, while the English displace the French, and are themselves oppressed by the Americans. The English and French in Canada are seen as both oppressors and oppressed, which ties F. and I. together. According to F., the Qu√©b√©cois are able to come together under their feeling of oppression by the anglophones, but anglophone Canada is unable to bring together a national identity to distinguish themselves from the Americans. I. and F. were both raised in a Jesuit orphanage in Montreal. Melancholic I. identifies with victims and losers, such as the \\"A‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\\" tribe, whose very name is said to mean \\"corpse in the language of all the neighboring tribes\\". while F. tries to ignore or overcome his \\"loser\\"-ness. He asserts himself by throwing himself into the Charles Axis bodybuilding course advertised in a comic book (a parody of the Charles Atlas advertisements well known to contemporary comic-book readers). He asserts his culture by becoming a leader in the Quebec separatist movement. Background Hydra, where Cohen wrote Beautiful Losers Cohen had published a number of books of poetry since the 1956 appearance of Let Us Compare Mythologies, and one novel, The Favourite Game (1963). He had been living on the Greek island of Hydra in the early to mid-1960s, and had composed The Favourite Game and a book of poetry, Flowers for Hitler, there. On Hydra, English was spoken, and there was an artists' colony there. Cohen wanted to write a \\"liturgy, a big confessional oration, very crazy, but using all the techniques of the modern novel ... pornographic suspense, humor and conventional plotting\\". Cohen wrote most of the novel during two concentrated eight-month periods in 1964 and 1965. He wrote using a typewriter in a house in Hydra while listening to a portable record player, on which he listened to his favourite Ray Charles record, The Genius Sings the Blues. At first he managed only three pages a day, and sometimes wrote only one hour a day. When the novel began to take shape, he worked up to fifteen hours a day, with the help of amphetamines. He later claimed that amphetamine use was a mistake \\"for depressed people\\", as coming down was particularly hard. He said it took \\"ten years to fully recover\\". The first period of writing was interrupted when Cohen returned to Canada in October 1964 to receive the Prix litt√©raire du Qu√©bec for The Favourite Game, followed by a reading tour. One result of the tour was the film Ladies and Gentlemen... Mr. Leonard Cohen, released in 1965 from the National Film Board of Canada. The tour embittered Cohen, though, as he complained about money and the lack of exposure for his first novel. He found himself torn on the issue of Quebec separation that had arisen as the Quiet Revolution heated up. Montreal's francophone community was asserting itself against the anglophone elite. The Front de Lib√©ration du Qu√©bec had begun targeting anglophones with bombs in 1963, and a statue of Queen Victoria on Sherbrooke Street was destroyed with a bomb on 12 July. This political turmoil found its way into Cohen's work when he returned to Hydra. Cohen practised fasting during the composition of the novel, believing that it helped focus his creativity and spirituality. Following its completion, Cohen broke down, collapsing from sunstroke and amphetamine consumption. He had hallucinations, and had withered to 116 pounds after going without food for ten days. Cohen published another book of poetry, Parasites of Heaven, in 1966, but by then it became clear to Cohen that he would be unable to make a living as a writer. He shifted focus to music, particularly after becoming interested in Bob Dylan in 1966. That year, he decided to devote himself seriously to a singing career. It was his music for which he later became well known. Publication history In March 1965, Cohen told Jack McClelland, president of Canadian publishing house McClelland and Stewart, that he would finish the novel in a month. He stated that it would be a success if it escaped the censors, and asked for a cash advance, as he was in need of money. When he completed it three weeks later, he declared that he had \\"written the Bhagavad Gita of 1965\\". He claimed he had figured out how to \\"write a novel in three weeks\\", and that he would manage four more in 1965. Cohen pondered a number of titles for the book. On two different drafts were the titles Beautiful Losers / A Pop Novel and Plastic Birchbark / A Treatment of the World, and notes and letters show him listing many other possible titles. Viking put the difficult book through eight readings before deciding to publish it. Cohen responded to the book's acceptance with a parodic six-page letter anticipating the response of offended Canadian critics. As a condition of the book's publication, Cohen insisted on having control over the cover and jacket copy, so as to avoid the disappointment he had had with the publication of Flowers for Hitler. Further, he insisted on no quotations from critics on the jacket. Publication was somewhat complicated when Cohen lost a carbon copy of the original manuscript to the wind. He was able to continue with revisions after having his New York agent send him another carbon copy. The pre-publication orders of 3,100 copies were more than expected. Before publication, a number of film producers were eying the book, such as Otto Preminger, Ulu Grosbard, Alexander Cohen and the MCA Group. McClelland realized that censorship would be a problem in Canada, and tried to soften the blow with advance publicity via advance copies. The responses from the readers of the advance copies were too negative for him to use, however. A gala lunch was thrown a month in advance of the book's release, and about four hundred of the top names in the Canadian arts world appeared there. Posters had Cohen in a turtleneck and jacket in the hopes that such a sober pose would offset the anticipated scandal. The University of Toronto, which had started collecting Cohen's papers starting in 1964, paid Cohen $6,000 for the original manuscript. The first printing was printed by Viking and bound by McClelland & Stewart. It included typographical extras not included in future editions, such as comic book captions, a Charles Axis advertisement, a radio transcript of Gavin and the Goddesses, and a Greek- English phrase book. Distribution was restricted, with Simpson's and W. H. Smith refusing to carry the book, despite McClelland's reassurances to W. H. Smith that \\"most of the people interested in pornography would not begin to understand either Cohen's purpose or his accomplishment\\". The $6.50 cover price dampened sales as well. Cohen thought it too high, but McClelland explained it was necessary to offset the publication costs and extensive promotion. He accused Cohen of being \\"unwilling to put [him]self out\\" in the way of promotion, and urged him to do more television and radio interviews. Sources and influences Cohen made use of a number of texts when researching and writing Beautiful Losers: * Une vierge iroquoise: Catherine Tekakwitha, le lis de bors de la Mohawk et du St. Laurent (1656‚Äì1680) by P. Edouard Lecompte * Kateri of the Mohawks by Marie Cecilia Buehrle * Jesuits in North America * a 1943 issue of the American comic book Blue Beetle * a farmer's almanac * Twilight of the Idols by Friedrich Nietzsche * Song of Hiawatha by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow He also read Emanuel Swedenborg extensively: the first two volumes of Arcana C≈ìlestia, Divine Providence and Divine Love and Wisdom. He would meet with other writers at the Hydra colony to discuss works such as the Book of Revelation, the I Ching, The Secret of the Golden Flower and The Tibetan Book of the Dead. Cohen brought works by Martin Buber and Gershom Sholem to these meetings. Style Beautiful Losers is not written in a linear, coherent fashion. Key scenes repeat themselves, and there is no timeline the reader can follow. Reception Initial sales were poor. It sold better in the US than in Canada, but did not see significant sales until after Cohen achieved success as a singer-songwriter. The novel attracted the attention of critics, and was met with much controversy. Critic Robert Fulford called Beautiful Losers \\"the most revolting book ever written in Canada\\", while also stating it was \\"an important failure. At the same time it is probably the most interesting Canadian book of the year\\". He reported a few days later that a Toronto bookstore had not managed to sell any of the twenty-five copies it stocked eight days after publication. Critics were less shocked by the breaking of taboos than the general public was. Instead, they objected to the novel's complexity of allusion and representation, and the demands it put on the reader due to its incoherence and indeterminacy. It would take another generation of postmodern Canadian literature before Beautiful Losers would breach the canon. In 1966, the CBC called Beautiful Losers \\"one of the most radical and extraordinary works of fiction ever published in Canada\\", and quoted a critic from the Boston Globe who positively compared the work with the fiction of James Joyce. However, they also quoted from the previously mentioned negative review from the critic Robert Fulford.Leonard Cohen on CBC In 1967, Desmond Pacey called Beautiful Losers \\"the most intricate, erudite and fascinating Canadian novel ever written\\". In his 1970 monograph on Cohen, Michael Ondaatje called it \\"the most vivid, fascinating and brave modern novel\\" he had read. Beautiful Losers had been translated into eleven languages by 1990, and the sales of both of Cohen's novels have surpassed a million copies; Beautiful Losers had topped three million in sales by 2007. Legacy Beautiful Losers has entered the canon of Canadian literature, and has been given much credit for having introduced postmodern literature to Canadian fiction. Beautiful Losers was the inspiration for the song Let's Be Other People by the English band The Wonderstuff on their Hup_(album). An excerpt from Beautiful Losers appears in The Young Ones (TV series) associated book \\"Neil's Book Of The Dead\\", making up almost all of chapter 6.

RAPTOR was manufactured by the Goodrich Corporation, initially part of UTC Aerospace Systems, but now part of Collins Aerospace. The RAPTOR contained a DB-110 reconnaissance sensor, an imagery data recording system and an air-to-ground data link system. The sensor is electro-optical and infrared, allowing day or night missions. The data link allows imagery to be exploited almost instantly.  DB-110  DB-110 ('dual-band 110-inch focal length') was developed as an exportable derivative of the U-2's Senior Year Electro-Optical Reconnaissance System (SYERS-2). It represents a shift for airborne tactical reconnaissance systems from visible light, daylight-only film-based systems to dual-band day and night digital imaging with real-time downlinking. The DB-110 remains the only comparable LOROP (Long-Range Oblique Photography) pod to have been demonstrated in use on tactical aircraft. DB-110 installations, such as RAPTOR, also include a reconnaissance mission planning system (RMPS). Planned missions produce route cards for a pilot's kneeboard, are downloaded to route planning systems on either the recon aircraft or AWACS aircraft and are placed on a PCMCIA card that is used to load the pod itself with sensor tasking information.  RAF use  An RAF GR4 equipped with a RAPTOR pod beneath its fuselage in 2007 No. II (AC) Sqn and 13 Sqn were the RAF's two specialist Tornado reconnaissance units, but with the RAPTOR pod any GR4 squadron could undertake reconnaissance missions. The RAF procured eight RAPTOR units and two ground stations. RAPTOR achieved its operational debut during Operation Telic, the UK contribution to the 2003 Iraq War.  Other users  RAPTOR was also used on Japanese OP-3C maritime reconnaissance aircraft. DB-110 pods have also been supplied for Polish F-16s in 2006 and Turkish F-16s in 2013. Saudi Arabia in 2012 became the tenth country to use the DB-110 and the first for F-15 carriage.

Overview The \\"Rockbound\\" mentioned in the title is an island off the coast of Nova Scotia. Surrounded by rich but dangerous fishing grounds, Rockbound is isolated by storms, fog and winter weather. Two feuding families, the Jungs and the Krauses are dominated by the \\"king of Rockbound\\", the sternly righteous and rapacious Uriah Jung. When the young David Jung arrives on Rockbound to claim his inheritance, a small share of the island, he is forced to confront an unforgiving, and controlled world. His conflicts‚Äîboth internal and external‚Äîlock him in a struggle for survival. His enemies are many: sometimes the ocean, sometimes his own rude behaviour, sometimes his own best friend, sometimes his secret love for the island teacher, but always his relatives and their ambitions for money and power. Rockbound paints a portrait of hard toil, cunning bitterness and family strife in the years leading to World War I. The novel evokes the infinite power, the terror and the cruel beauty of the Atlantic Ocean including the terrifying sinking of a fishing schooner based on the loss of the schooner Sylvia Mosher on August 9, 1926 during the 1926 August Gales at Sable Island.Gwendolyn Davies, \\"Afterword\\", Rockbound, University of Toronto Press (1989), p. 302 Inspiration Rockbound was based on the island of East Ironbound, Nova Scotia. Day spent the summer of 1926 on East Ironbound telling the families who welcomed him and shared their stories that he was working on a book about William Shakespeare. East Ironbound became a thinly disguised Rockbound while Tancook became the novel's Outer Island; Lunenburg became Liscomb; and Pearl Island became Barren Island. East Ironbound's two main families the Fincks and the Youngs inspired Rockbound's rival families the Krauses and the Jungs. Day's interpretation, distortion and exaggeration of community and personal lives on East Ironbound offended the residents of the island who felt betrayed. They published a letter in the Lunenburg and Halifax papers accusing Day of exploiting them for money.Gwendolyn Davies, \\"Afterword\\", Rockbound, University of Toronto Press (1989), p. 295-296.

Volkswagen Blues was translated into English by Sheila Fischman and published by McClelland & Stewart in 1988 and subsequently re-issued by Cormorant Books in 2002. Volkswagen Blues was nominated for the Governor General's Award for French-language fiction at the 1984 Governor General's Awards and was one of the selected novels in the 2005 edition of Canada Reads, where it was championed by author and former National Librarian of Canada, Roch Carrier. Plot Volkswagen Blues is a road novel, in the tradition of Jack Kerouac, about a middle-aged, formerly successful writer who has adopted the pen-name Jack Waterman (a metonymy can play on Waterman pens) and, as the novel begins, is experiencing a bout of writer's block. Discovering an old postcard, the protagonist embarks on a quest in search of his long-lost, rambling brother, Th√©o. Early in the narrative, Jack picks up a hitchhiker, a young M√©tisse woman, nicknamed \\"La Grande Sauterelle\\" due her long, grasshopper-like legs, as a travel companion, as well as a cat named Chop Suey. Together in Jack's Volkswagen Minibus, which through personification becomes a character in the story, they travel from Gasp√© to San Francisco, passing through Toronto, Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis and the American West on their way, exploring the history of European contact with the native people of the Americas. While on the road, they discuss language, literature, American expansion, the Oregon Trail, etc., and their trip becomes an allegory for the history of the French exploration of North America. At the same time, La Grande Sauterelle, who is struggling with her own identity, presents another version of American history, as recounted by the natives, where \\"discovery\\" is viewed as \\"invasion.\\" Throughout the episodic novel a number of interesting and entertaining characters appear, including journalists, museum directors, railroad hoboes and writers such as Saul Bellow and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, as well as the spirit of Ernest Hemingway, John Muir and the Beat Generation. All in all, Jack's journey through an America that scholar Paul Socken describes as a \\"lost paradise\\" is one of disillusionment and self-discovery that allows him to break through the impasse he had met in his writing.

Biography Janet Flanner-Solita Solano Collection/LOC ppmsca.13300. Jane Heap, John Rodker, Martha Dennison, Tristan Tzara, Margaret C. Anderson, ca. 1920s John Rodker was born on 18 December 1894 in Manchester, into a Jewish immigrant family. The family moved to London while he was still young. As a young man, he was one of the so-called \\"Whitechapel Boys\\", a group including Isaac Rosenberg, Mark Gertler, David Bomberg, Samuel Weinstein and Joseph Lefkowitz (who coined the name in hindsight). From about 1911, when Rosenberg arrived, they began to aspire to literary careers; and in the years before 1914 Rodker was a published essayist and poet, in The New Age of A. R. Orage and elsewhere. Other \\"Whitechapel Boys\\" were the painters David Bomberg and Mark Gertler; they all met together at or near the Whitechapel Art Gallery. During World War I, Rodker was a conscientious objector. He went on the run, sheltering with the poet R. C. Trevelyan, before being arrested in April 1917, imprisoned, and then transferred to the Home Office Work Centre, Princetown, in the former Dartmoor Prison. He describes this in his book Memoirs of Other Fronts. In 1919 Rodker started the Ovid Press, a small press which lasted about a year. It published T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound (the first edition of Hugh Selwyn Mauberley) and portfolios of drawings by Wyndham Lewis, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Edward Wadsworth. In the opinion of one modern scholar, \\"the Ovid Press remains his most significant contribution for the originality of the titles he chose and for the place the imprint maintains alongside other private presses of the period.\\" That same year, Rodker took over from Pound as foreign editor of the New York magazine, The Little Review. In the 1920s he spent time in Paris on the second edition of James Joyce's Ulysses, at that time subject to censorship, and on French translations of Joyce. He then set up the Casanova Society, for limited editions. He continued in publishing, on occult subjects under the imprint \\"J. Rodker\\" also, until a bankruptcy in 1932, when (along with other such ventures such as the Fanfrolico Press) his business folded in the Depression. He was included in the 1930 Faber and Faber collection Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress of Joyceans. For a period he dropped publishing, concentrating on translation from French literature, and agency work for Preslit, the Soviet overseas literature organ. At this time too he apparently abandoned literary ambitions for himself. In 1937, the centennial of the death of Aleksandr Pushkin, he set up the Pushkin Press, another small press, publishing Oliver Elton's English version of Eugene Onegin and a trickle of other books. The Imago Publishing Company was a separate, more substantial venture, set up after Sigmund Freud arrived in London in 1938. The stocks of Freud's works left when he fled Vienna and the Nazis had been destroyed; Rodker with Anna Freud worked to publish a complete edition. This was done over a dozen years, being finished in 1952. Imago was wound up in 1961. Rodker was fluent in French, writing regularly for a French literary magazine, and was posthumously awarded the L√©gion d'Honneur by the government of France. Personal life John Rodker's father, David, joined the mass exodus of Jews from what is now Poland to escape the pogroms of the 1880s, moving to England, where, like a number of his family members, he worked as a corset-maker. As far as we know, all the Rodkers in the world are related ‚Äì the name seems to have been invented for (or by) just this one family. This surname appears to be a toponymic surname based on the town of Rodka, now in Romania and renamed to RƒÉdƒÉu»õi. David married Leah Jacobson; their children were John and Peter. John's younger brother Peter, who used the surname Roker (without the \\"d\\"), served for five years during World War I and married Helen Scott. He was institutionalized for mental illness from 1934 until his death in 1973. John Rodker married three times. He and his first wife, the writer Mary Butts (1890‚Äì1937), married in May 1918. He already had a daughter, Joan (1915‚Äì2010),Obituary: Joan Rodker, The Daily Telegraph, 23 January 2011 (online edition)Jenny Diski Obituary: Joan Rodker, The Independent, 13 January 2011 from an earlier relationship with the dancer, Sonia Cohen (1885‚Äì1979). His daughter by Mary Butts was Camilla (1920‚Äì2007), who married Henry Israel. The second marriage was to Barbara McKenzie-Smith (1902‚Äì1996), a painter, resulting in a son, John Paul (born in 1937), whose surname was changed to Morrison when his mother, after a divorce, married E.A. Morrison III. Moura Budberg was John Paul's godmother. The third marriage was to Marianne Rais (died 1984), a Paris bookseller and daughter of his translator Ludmila Savitzky. Joan Rodker's son, Ernest Rodker (born 1937), by the actor Gerard Heinz, was a post-World War II conscientious objector, a founder member of the Committee of 100 and serves as the British spokesperson for Mordechai VanunuUK Campaign to Free Mordechai Vanunu and became a founding member of the Battersea Power Station Community Group.

Seegmuller left Pushkin in March 2015. In 2013, Pushkin Press created Pushkin Children's Books, an imprint dedicated to publishing tales for younger readers. In its first year, Pushkin Children's Books published English translations of the French children's series Oksa Pollock by Anne Plichota and Cendrine Wolf, the first of which, The Last Hope, was the company's bestselling title in 2014. Dutch Classic The Letter for the King by Tonke Dragt, translated into English by Laura Watkinson, has been the company's most successful children's book.

Olson scored 38/40 on the Psychopathy Checklist. Murders Christine Weller, 12, from Surrey, British Columbia, was abducted on November 17, 1980. Her body was found more than a month later on Christmas Day; she had been strangled with a belt and stabbed repeatedly. On April 16, 1981, Colleen Marian Daignault, 13, vanished. Five months later her body was found. On April 22, 1981, Daryn Todd Johnsrude, 16, was abducted and killed; his body was found less than two weeks later. On May 19, 1981, 16-year-old Sandra Wolfsteiner was murdered, and 13-year-old Ada Anita Court was murdered in June 1981. Six victims followed in quick succession in July 1981. Simon Partington, 9, was abducted, raped and strangled on the second day of the month. Judy Kozma, a 14-year-old from New Westminster, was raped and strangled a week later. Her body was discovered on July 25 near Weaver Lake. The next victims were Raymond King II, 15, abducted on July 23, raped and bludgeoned to death; Sigrun Arnd, an 18-year-old German tourist, raped and bludgeoned two days later; Terri Lyn Carson, 15, raped and strangled on July 27; and Louise Chartrand, age 17, the last victim identified, who died on July 30. Arrest and plea bargain Olson, who had an extensive criminal history, was arrested on August 12, 1981, on suspicion of attempting to abduct two girls. By August 25, Olson had been charged with the murder of Judy Kozma. He reached a controversial deal with authorities, agreeing to confess to the 11 murders and show the RCMP the location of the bodies of those not yet recovered. In return, authorities agreed that $10,000 for each victim was paid into a trust for his wife, Joan, and then-infant son, Clifford III.Serial killer Clifford Olson dying of cancer - https://www.thestar.com/news/article/1057272 His wife received $100,000 after Olson cooperated with the RCMP, the 11th body being a \\"freebie\\". In January 1982, Olson pleaded guilty to 11 counts of murder and was given as many concurrent life sentences to be served in Canada's super-maximum security Special Handling Unit in Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines, Quebec, which houses many of the country's most dangerous criminals. Olson was a dangerous offender, meaning it was very unlikely he would ever be released from prison. Parole application At his sentencing January 14, 1982, the trial judge remarked, \\"My considered opinion is that you should never be granted parole for the remainder of your days. It would be foolhardy to let you at large.\\" In 1997, Olson was denied parole, for which he applied under Canada's \\"faint hope clause\\", which allowed a parole hearing for convicts who had served at least 15 years. Canadian law allows inmates convicted of first-degree murder to apply for parole after serving a minimum of 25 years. Olson's second parole hearing, on July 18, 2006, was also denied. Olson made many bizarre and false claims, including that the United States had granted him clemency for providing information about the September 11 attacks and that the hearing had no jurisdiction over him because of that. Under Canadian law, Olson was then entitled to make a case for parole every two years. Olson was once again refused parole in November 2010. Old Age Security pension controversy Controversy developed in March 2010 when the media disclosed that Olson was receiving two federal government benefits from Canada while imprisoned, a total of $1,169.47 monthly. Olson was eligible to receive the Canadian Old Age Security (OAS) pension. All persons who meet residency requirements as to length of time in Canada are eligible to receive this pension at age 65, and Olson turned 70 on January 1, 2010. Olson was also eligible to receive the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS), awarded to pensioners with low income. The money in question was being held in trust for Olson. The Canadian Taxpayers Federation testified before the federal standing committee for Human Resources Development to have MPs pass Bill C-31, which would terminate pension benefits for prisoners. The organization also presented the government with 46,000 petition signatures requesting that Olson no longer receive the benefits. Prime Minister Stephen Harper asked government officials to look into the issue; on June 1, 2010, the government moved to terminate Olson's payments, calling the fact that he had been receiving them \\"outrageous\\" and \\"offensive\\". In September 2010, Olson sent one of his Old Age Security cheques to a Sun Media reporter, Peter Worthington, with a note asking him to forward the cheque to Harper's campaign for re-election. Illness and death In September 2011, media reports indicated that Olson had terminal cancer and had been transferred to a hospital in Laval, Quebec. He died on September 30, 2011, at the age of 71.

Alex Krycek is played by Nicholas Lea. He is initially introduced in the second season as a partner for FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder in the absence of his previous partner, Dana Scully. As the show progressed, Krycek grew to become one of the show's primary antagonists, appearing subsequently in every season until Season 9. Krycek's machinations frequently pitted him against Mulder, with whom he shared a complicated relationship. He was variously seen as either a henchman or enemy of the show's primary antagonist, The Smoking Man, changing his allegiance when the situation suited him best.  Character arc  Krycek is a Russian-American, the son of Cold War immigrants, who makes his first appearance in the season two episode \\"Sleepless\\", where Krycek, a young FBI Special Agent is assigned as a temporary investigation partner to Fox Mulder. Krycek proceeds to work with Mulder and attempts to gain his trust. It later becomes evident, however, that Krycek is actually an undercover agent working for the Smoking Man. Krycek plays an important part in several events that are harmful to Mulder and Dana Scully: he assists in Scully's abduction, and murders Mulder's father, William \\"Bill\\" Mulder. Krycek also assaults Assistant Director Walter Skinner and acquires a secret tape from him which reveals a US government coverup regarding alien visits to Earth. After a botched attempt on Scully results in the death of her sister, the Cigarette Smoking Man attempts to kill Krycek with a car bomb, but Krycek escapes. Krycek is later found to have been selling the secrets from the encrypted MJ files. Under the influence of the black oil, Krycek returns the tape to the Smoking Man, in return for knowledge of the location of an alien ship. The black oil-controlled Krycek goes to the ship, which has been moved to an abandoned missile silo in North Dakota. The black oil extracts itself from Krycek, leaving him locked indefinitely in the silo with the ship. Krycek is next found during an FBI raid, and taken into custody by Mulder and Scully. They learn that Krycek was recruited by an extremist militia group on a salvage hunt from the silo in North Dakota, and he informs the agents they must track the source of an extraterrestrial rock, brought to America by a foreign diplomat, to a gulag in Russia. The hunt leads Krycek and Mulder to Tunguska, where they are held captive until Krycek maneuvers his own release. Mulder attempts his own escape, taking an unconscious Krycek with him. When he awakes, Krycek separates into the woods only to encounter a strange group of Russians, all of whom have missing left arms. The men amputate Krycek's arm as well, to keep him from being used in black oil experiments. Eventually, Krycek graduates into a more powerful role within this group. He uses any knowledge he has to gain leverage with the syndicate. He even has had romantic ties to their secretary, Marita Covarrubias (who apparently was using Krycek for her own means in assisting Mulder). Due to this double-crossing, Krycek is temporarily held captive by the Well Manicured Man. Krycek later appears to Mulder as a friendly messenger to tell him that a war has begun, and that Mulder must \\"resist or serve\\". Later in the series, Krycek can be seen switching sides as it suits him, occasionally helping Mulder, Cigarette Smoking Man and other people. He attempted to blackmail Skinner with infectious nanotechnology, but ended up being thrown into a Tunisian prison by the Cigarette Smoking Man. In the season seven finale, \\"Requiem\\", Krycek tries and fails to kill the Cigarette Smoking Man, who now uses a wheelchair, by pushing him down a flight of stairs. Later, when Mulder was abducted by aliens and returned in a deathlike state, Krycek attempts to again blackmail Skinner, with the means to save Mulder's life. Skinner refuses, and Krycek has a violent confrontation with John Doggett before escaping. In the season eight finale, \\"Existence\\", Krycek is shot between the eyes and killed by Skinner, during an unsuccessful attempt to kill Mulder. Krycek's ghost briefly showed up to help Mulder escape a military base in the series finale.  Conceptual history  Originally, the role of Krycek was offered to Callum Keith Rennie, who rejected it, but later made two guest appearances on the show. Krycek does not appear in the first season, but Nicholas Lea did have a small part in the Monster-of-the-Week episode, \\"Gender Bender\\". In the episode, he played a club goer named \\"Michel\\". When Lea appeared as Krycek, the producers felt that they could kill him off if the portraying actor didn't do a good enough job. Krycek, who was initially created by writer Howard Gordon to temporarily replace Scully as Mulder's partner for three episodes, eventually grew into a character that lasted eight seasons on the show. The character appears in 22 episodes between seasons two and nine.  Reception  Nicholas Lea would also appear as Krycek on the sketch show Saturday Night Live, when David Duchovny hosted the May 9, 1998, episode. Duchovny and Lea appeared in their roles as Mulder and Krycek, respectively in a sketch that spoofed The X-Files. The X-Files Season 10 (comic book) in the first part of a five-part story Krycek appears to have returned from the dead in Saudi Arabia, where a store of black oil has been tapped. He helps Mulder escape an attempt on his life.

The crustal block or fragment preserves its own distinctive geologic history, which is different from that of the surrounding areas‚Äîhence the term \\"exotic\\" terrane. The suture zone between a terrane and the crust it attaches to is usually identifiable as a fault. Older usage of terrane simply described a series of related rock formations or an area having a preponderance of a particular rock or rock groups. Overview A tectonostratigraphic terrane is not necessarily an independent microplate in origin, since it may not contain the full thickness of the lithosphere. It is a piece of crust which has been transported laterally, usually as part of a larger plate, and is relatively buoyant due to thickness or low density. When the plate of which it was a part subducted under another plate, the terrane failed to subduct, detached from its transporting plate, and accreted onto the overriding plate. Therefore, the terrane transferred from one plate to the other. Typically, accreting terranes are portions of continental crust which have rifted off another continental mass and been transported surrounded by oceanic crust, or they are old island arcs formed at some distant subduction zone. A tectonostratigraphic terrane is a fault-bounded package of rocks of at least regional extent characterized by a geologic history which differs from that of neighboring terranes. The basic characteristics of these terranes is that the present spatial relations are not compatible with the inferred geologic histories. Where terranes which lie next to each other possess strata of the same age, it must be demonstrable that the geologic evolutions are different and incompatible, and there must be an absence of intermediate lithofacies which could link the strata. The concept of tectonostratigraphic terrane developed from studies in the 1970s of the complicated Pacific Cordilleran orogenic margin of North America, a complex and diverse geological potpourri that was difficult to explain until the new science of plate tectonics illuminated the ability of crustal fragments to \\"drift\\" thousands of miles from their origin and fetch up, crumpled, against an exotic shore. Such terranes were dubbed \\"accreted terranes\\" by geologists. When terranes are composed of repeated accretionary events, and hence are composed of subunits with distinct history and structure, they may be called superterranes.\\"Terranes\\" University of British Columbia website Tectonostratigraphic terranes Africa *Birminian Terrane *Kahiltna Terrane *Likasi Terrane *Mozambique Belt Asia *Aldan Terrane *Bargusin Terrane *Daldyn Terrane *Magan Terrane *Markha Terrane *Shan‚ÄìThai Terrane *Tungus Terrane *Tynda Terrane *Uchur Terrane Taiwan *Coastal Range Terrane *Longitudinal Valley Terrane *Eastern Central Range Terrane *Western Central Range Terrane *Hsuehshan Range Terrane *Western Foothills Terrane *Coastal Plain Terrane Tibet *Lhasa TerraneAitchison, J.

It began operations in 1883 in Braintree, and moved to its final location on Quincy Point in 1901. In 1913, it was purchased by Bethlehem Steel, and later transferred to Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation. It was sold to General Dynamics in 1963, and closed in 1986. During its operation, yardworkers constructed hundreds of ships, for both military and civilian clients. Most of the ships at the yard were built for the United States Navy, with its first government contract for the destroyer . The yard also built early submarines for Electric Boat, including and . Fore River also constructed the battleship , and the cruisers and as well as the Navy's first carrier and its successor . Fore River produced multiple foreign ships for various navies around the world including five Type 1 submarines for the Imperial Japanese Navy, ten submarines for the Royal Navy, and the battleship , for the Argentine Navy. The yard also constructed several merchant marine ships, including Thomas W. Lawson, the largest pure sailing ship ever built, and , which was the first ship constructed to carry refrigerated chemicals. General Dynamics Quincy Shipbuilding Division, as it eventually came to be known, ended its career as a producer of various LNG tankers and merchant marine ships. According to one theory, the yard was the origin of the \\"Kilroy was here\\" pop culture reference, and was home to the second-largest shipbuilding crane in the world. During the period in which it was operable, the yard had two sub-yards: the first was the Victory Destroyer Plant in Quincy during World War I, and the second was the Bethlehem Hingham Shipyard in Hingham during World War II. In addition, the yard owned Bethlehem Atlantic Works, a drydock facility which was located in East Boston. History =Origins= The shipyard traces its beginnings back to 1882, when Thomas A. Watson purchased a farm alongside the Fore River in East Braintree, Massachusetts. In 1884, Watson attempted to farm the land, but soon realizing that it was a failure, decided to work on a steam engine after he was approached by a local businessman. Work on the engine began in 1884, and continued into 1885, when it was deemed a financial failure. At this point, Watson decided to work with his business partner Frank O. Wellington on ship building, creating the Fore River Engine Company. =Fore River Engine Company= 1899 advertisement for the Fore River Shipyard Following an order from Maine for a 50-horsepower engine, Thomas A. Watson and Frank O. Wellington decided to build boats, which came after realizing the profitability of the enterprise as the result of building their first ship, the Barnacle, which was fitted with local furnishings. Watson later said of this decision: > It was a momentous decision for from it came one of the largest shipbuilding > establishments in the country, if not in the world, that made Massachusetts > again a shipbuilding center and afterwards played an important part in the > World War. The success of this operation was further strengthened the fact that the shipyard was producing a quality engine, and it quickly gained a reputation along the eastern seaboard. Soon, a new engine-building facility was constructed, employing between twenty and thirty workers. Additionally, the Prouty Printing Press and Sims-Dudley dynamite gun, staple guns for shoes, and electric light accessories were produced by Fore River. In addition, the diversity of Fore River's products was due to the fact that Watson desired to employ as many friends as possible. The Panic of 1893 brought a new era to the company, as the depression limited the Fore River's possibilities. Fortunately for Fore River, the United States Navy awarded a contract to them to construct and . These two ships were the last to be constructed at the East Braintree location, as the yard moved down the river to a site on nearby Quincy Point in 1901. The construction of United States lightship LV-72 alongside the destroyers further strengthened the company financially. The awarding of was also beneficial for Fore River. Faced with the problem of not having a large enough area to build the cruiser, the contract was produced at the new Quincy yard. The Des Moines was launched in 1902 and commissioned in 1904, bringing with it some financial stability to the yard, as new revenues were quadruple those at the East Braintree location. During the construction of the new yard, old buildings were floated over to make up for the lack of buildings at the new location, and it was constructed with some of the largest shipbuilding equipment of the day. =Fore River Ship and Engine Company= Thomas W. Lawson on her maiden voyage in 1902 The building of the new yard created ample space for building new ships, which allowed for the building of and . The Navy did mandate that before they could receive the bids, they would have to incorporate, so the company was incorporated in New Jersey, with a capital of $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars). Immediately, Thomas A. Watson realized that the contract would be more costly than anticipated, but soon an order came in for the seven-masted Thomas W. Lawson. This was immediately followed by an order for the six-masted William L. Douglas, which was delivered in 1903. In 1902, Watson decided to build the Fore River Railroad, a short-line railroad from East Braintree to the yard, away. This was done in order to save costs of having to remove supplies from the trains, transport it over land to Weymouth Fore River, and then float it over to the yard. Watson ended up buying a parcel of land after the owner refused to sell him of land for the railroad. During this time, the yard struggled financially, as expenses from suppliers exceeded reimbursement from the Navy. As a result, Watson decided to sell some of his telephone stock and secured a loan. At this time, the yard was awarded with a contract for , although this did not solve the company's troubles. Following a failed attempt by Watson to seek reimbursement from the Navy, he eventually resigned and was replaced by former Admiral Francis T. Bowles, as he was pleased by how Bowles ran the yard. In 1905, the yard gained a contract to build the Brown-Curtis steam turbine engine, which was considered to be too fast to be economical at the time. That same year, the Navy awarded a contract to build the Chester-class cruisers at the yard, two of which were supposed to be equipped with the Brown-Curtis turbine, but which later received new turbines. The first five submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy in Japan The Russo-Japanese War further benefited the yard, as the Imperial Japanese Navy contracted five Type 1 submarines at the yard. Little is known of the first submarines built at the yard, although they were promptly disassembled and shipped to the West Coast, from which they were shipped to Japan in 1904.Gardiner, Robert, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1906‚Äì1921 Conway Maritime Press, 1985, p. 245. . The war brought expanded submarine development to the yard, as the Holland Torpedo Boat Company was purchased by the Electric Boat Company. Since Electric Boat had no yard of its own, it subcontracted to Fore River in order to complete orders. The first American submarine built at the yard was , launched in 1906. This arrangement lasted for the next twenty years, until Electric Boat built its own yard in 1924. Fore River would remain the primary builder of Electric Boat-designed submarines through the S-class of 1922, completing a total of 69 submarines for the US Navy during this period. During this time, the yard built civilian ships, including Sankaty, which was built for the New Bedford, Martha's Vineyard & Nantucket Steamboat Company. Furthermore, the company created the Fore River Apprentice School, in order to ensure that an adequately trained workforce would be able to work at the yard in the coming years. Over time, over 2,000 people were graduated from its program. In 1906, and were delivered by the yard, marking the yard's first battleships delivered. The completion of these two battleships and other ships at the yard coincided at a time when there were 2,500 people employed. In 1908, there were eighteen contracts employed at Fore River, which would not be met again until 1916. The yard also completed car floats for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad during this time. Of note, Fore River fielded a soccer team from at least 1907 to around 1920-1921\\\\. This team, which played in local leagues, was part of one of the early soccer leagues in the United States. Launching of Rivadavia Another big development in the history of the yard was the receiving of the contract to build the for the Argentine Navy. The ship was one of two foreign battleships ever constructed in the United States, and occurred during the South American dreadnought race. After a long bidding process, the Argentine Naval Commission found that the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company bid was lowest on one battleship, and the Fore River Shipbuilding Company was lowest on the other. Despite some possible setbacks, the upcoming 1910 Pan-American Conference, and a guarantee of American participation in the Argentine centennial celebrations, Fore River secured the battleship contracts on 21 January 1910.Livermore, \\"Battleship Diplomacy,\\" 38. The maximum price Fore River tendered, $10.7 million, underbid the British by more than $973,000, but their ship's displacement was smaller, the belt armor was thinner, and the top speed was slightly slower.Alger, \\"Professional Notes,\\" 595. Rivadavia was built by Fore River, but they were contractually obligated to subcontract the second ship to a different shipyard in the hope that both would be completed faster, so was constructed by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey.Scheina, Latin America, 83. The steel for the ships was largely supplied by the Bethlehem Steel Company of Pennsylvania,\\"Argentine Navy; Dreadnought Orders,\\" Evening Post, 23 March 1910, 4. which, due to their ability to produce steel at a lower price than other nations, was an integral cost-saving measure.Livermore, \\"Battleship Diplomacy,\\" 39. The ship was laid down in 1910, but was finally delivered in 1914 after delays in construction due to a work backlog at the yard. It was because of this issue that Admiral Bowles suggested that the yard be sold to a larger corporation, as it would be able to better deal with the extra workload than the yard could on its own. The last ship laid down in the yard at the time was , which occurred in 1912. In 1911, the yard was part of the case Fore River Shipbuilding Co. v. Hagg, in which a foreign citizen sued for the yard for reparation in the death of her husband, who was killed in the yard's forge shop. The case was later dismissed by the United States Supreme Court. =Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Ltd.= under construction in 1915, with visible in the background In 1913, Bethlehem Steel Corporation purchased the yard for $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars), as Charles M. Schwab was looking to diversify the company. At the time, the yard was constructing 23 vessels and doing a business of $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) a year. The yard was in size, and had a capacity for . At this time, Bethlehem decided to construct a drydock, although it would take into the 1920s to make this happen. Finally, immediate improvements were made to the yard to improve its financial well-being. The first year of the company's ownership brought little in terms of business. Two destroyers were ordered, three submarines were sublet in the yard, and no outside orders by private companies were received in this time. Furthermore, the Royal Navy placed an order during this time for ten submarines. Due to the fact that the United States was officially neutral during World War I, the yard prefabricated the submarines, and then shipped the parts to Canada for assembly. In 1915, the Spanish Navy contracted out the building of the submarine Isaac Peral (A-0) in the yard, while the United States Navy ordered . Finally, the Texas Oil Company and the Edward F. Luckenbach Company ordered four tankers and freighters, respectively. World War I O-class submarines from Submarine Division 8 at Boston Navy Yard, 1921, including many built at Fore River War brought opportunities for expansion for the yard. This meant the building of a steel mill and a sheet metal shop that contained one of the best molds in the country. The steel mill was capable of prefabricating of steel a day. A building slip was also constructed, costing $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars). The yard created a department that was dedicated to the welfare of its workers during this time, as well. 1916 brought nineteen contracts to the yard, eight of which were for the O-class submarine, and ten more submarines were laid down for the Royal Navy, with another ten being built in Montreal at the Canadian Vickers yard. The submarines, once built, were stored at the nearby Boston Navy Yard until the country entered the war. Over 15,000 persons were working at the yard at the time, including Joseph P. Kennedy. Entry of the United States into the war brought twenty-eight destroyer orders to the yard. Due to this sudden increase in production, the yard needed to expand. Soon, a suitable location was found on nearby Squantum Point, and the Victory Destroyer Plant started construction in 1917. Located on of land, the yard exclusively built destroyers, with being the last ship constructed at the plant. In 1920, the yard was turned over to the United States government and dismantled. This same year, Bethlehem Steel split off its shipbuilding division into the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, which was headquartered at the yard. Combined with the Squantum yard, Fore River turned out 71 destroyers during the war, more than any other American yard. Besides the other Quincy yard, Bethlehem built the Fields Point Plant for boiler construction in nearby Providence, Rhode Island and the Black Rock Plant for turbines in Buffalo, New York. The yard constructed in 174 days. Not to be outdone, the Squantum yard built in twenty-eight days, delivering it to the Navy seventeen days later. Such was the speed at which the yard produced ships that the Navy was forced to moor the ships at the Boston Navy Yard for lack of crews. The yard's speed allowed for the management to enter a bet with another Bethlehem plant, Union Iron Works, to see which plant would deliver more ships in a year. At the end of 1918, Fore River delivered eighteen ships to Union's six. Post-War and Great Depression LEXINGTON on ways under gantry cranes at Fore River, circa 1922 The end of World War I did not immediately affect the yard, as it was still producing ships from wartime orders. The only cancellations that occurred in the yard after the war were the cancellation of the Lexington-class battlecruiser . This was offset by the construction of two cruisers, which were delivered in due time. Additionally, the yard finished building the multiple orders that it received for the S-class submarine, as well as orders for two other submarines. Between 1922 and 1925, the yard underwent a major expansion period, including the purchase of the Atlantic Works, which later became Bethlehem Atlantic Works. Bethlehem also purchased a floating drydock from Simpson‚Äôs Dry Dock Company, built a battleship slip, and constructed a new way for merchant ships. The terms of the Washington Naval Treaty in 1921 brought the conversion of the Lexington to an aircraft carrier (), which was launched in 1925 in front of a group of over 20,000 people. The treaty brought about the cancellation of , part of the now-prohibited South Dakota-class battleship. The hull was eventually scrapped in 1923 with only 11% of the ship completed. The post-war lull brought about new opportunities for the yard, as it converted or upgraded ships such as , and overhauled locomotives for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. The yard produced brass fittings for banjo clocks, in an attempt by Charles Schwab to keep the talented workers employed. Eventually, this lull ended in 1925 with the order of a ferry for the City of Boston. Around this time, the yard received orders for and , both the lead ships of their respective classes. At the end of 1925, the yard had built 400 ships, 111 of which were military contracts, while the other 289 were for civilian organizations. Furthermore, the yard built the liners , and for the Oceanic Steamship Company. The Great Depression brought little work to the yard, with the exception of the completion of and . was built from 1936 to 1940, in addition to a handful of destroyers. Employment in the yard dropped drastically during this time, from 4,900 in 1931 to 812 two years later. World War II USS Massachusetts leaving the Weymouth Fore River, passing between the opened Fore River Bridge into Quincy Bay The Naval Act of 1938 brought increased shipbuilding to the yard, as it mandated a 20% increase in the strength of the nation's Navy. This brought an expansion of business to the yard, with 17,000 employees working in December 1941 and 32,000 in 1943, including 1,200 women. Payroll reached $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) around this time, and contracts amounted to around $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars). The speed of construction at the yard increased, as the keel of was laid immediately after was launched. The speed of the construction ran in line with the building of more ships. was cut up and relocated three times in order to accommodate the construction of other ships. Much like World War I, the yard expanded, and built the Bethlehem Hingham Shipyard in order to accommodate the increased construction demands. Sixteen ways were constructed on over , and 227 ships were produced with 23,500 workers. The yard produced in fourteen and a half months, and in a record of sixteen and a half months. The yard built ninety-two vessels of eleven classes during the war, and earned the Army-Navy \\"E\\" Award for excellence of construction of vessels, which was awarded on 15 May 1942, with four stars being added during the course of the war. Additionally, the yard produced , which was renamed from USS Cabot after the sinking of when yard workers petitioned for a renaming of the ship. Kilroy on the National World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C. During the war, the yard was possibly the origin of the popular expression \\"Kilroy was here.\\" Although it was not known originally where the phrase came from, the American Transit Association ran a contest trying to find the origin of the phrase in 1946. Welding inspector James J. Kilroy ended up sending his account in, and was deemed the winner. In an attempt to make sure that riveters would be prevented from defrauding the shipyard of their accurate workload, he scrawled the phrase in chalk on the ships that he was inspecting. Ships that the phrase was printed on included , USS Lexington, and various troop carriers. While the shipyard was at its peak of operations during the war, it was not uncommon for German U boats to stalk ships leaving the yard and engage them once offshore. =Post- war= in 1959. After the war, the yard was faced with new opportunities. As the war greatly expanded the yard, the yard now had extra space. Thus, the Hingham yard was closed, and the yard diversified its interests. The yard constructed a blast furnace, a wind tunnel, draglines, and steel for an aqueduct of the Boston's Metropolitan District Commission, a transformer for Boston Edison, among other things. The yard was faced with inflation, increasing material costs, and demands for higher wages. The yard did continue to turn out war orders for the ships and , the latter being the first ship in the Navy with air conditioning. The yard overhauled , , and of the Panama Railway Company. The yard ceased work until 1950 at the end of these conversions, with employment dipping to 3,800 employees. The line later took up building merchant ships for the American Export Lines, including the Type P3 ship ocean liners and , with the most powerful turbines placed in a merchant ships at that time. The yard converted and later into guided-missile cruisers, and delivered them to the Navy in 1953 and 1958, respectively. During this time, work continued to decline for the yard, although the yard found work in contracts from the United States Maritime Commission for three C4 tanker in 1951, and two more in 1952. Now, tankers became the yard's main work, with the Gulf Oil Corporation placing orders for two tankers, Socony ordering one tanker, and Orion contracting three more of the same tonnage. The Navy also ordered , which weighed and was an improvement over previous designs. Around this time, the yard began the construction of , the first ship which allowed for the shipment of chemicals over the ocean. Through refrigeration, this allowed for them to be transported safely and allowed for the carrying of eleven different chemicals at once. Furthermore, the yard built the C4-S-1 class freighter, a modification of the Type C4. Finally, the yard produced its largest destroyers yet, and . The yard's slow work after the war was a symptom of having a glut of extra ships that were available for the United States Merchant Marine. The passage of the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946 meant that ships could be sold for as little as $ (equivalent to roughly $ in today's dollars) per deadweight ton. The flip side of this glut of ships was that there was a prediction that in 1961, more ships would be need to be constructed. This was evidenced by the fact that in 1954, there were orders for five tankers, one fleet oiler, and five destroyers. The next year, the yard attempted to become part of the building of the Forrestal-class aircraft carriers when Bethlehem objected to the awarding of the contracts to the Newport News Shipbuilding and the New York Naval Yard. Although the company pointed out that it had produced many carriers during World War II, Newport News pointed out that the company never requested an improvement of its shipbuilding facilities by the government during the war, which hampered its future bidding of aircraft carrier construction. That it had not built a single carrier since the end of the war also hurt its chances. The yard was later rewarded four frigates to build instead. USS Bainbridge (top) and USS Long Beach, alongside as part of Operation Sea Orbit The yard began a new era when it was awarded construction of , a nuclear guided-missile cruiser. Such was the amount of work involved in the building of the Long Beach that the yard had to decline building , the world's first nuclear-powered merchant ship. The yard entered into an expansion period during these years, replacing six pre-World War I sliding ways, which could now accommodate between three and six ships. Ships were built for the Greek shipping company Stavros Niarchos including a tanker with a capacity of of crude oil, named and . The yard produced the nation's largest tanker, , which was christened by Frederica of Hanover, Queen of Greece. Fore River also branched out into radar tower construction in this time, constructing Texas Tower 2 in 1955 and Texas Tower 3 in 1956. The 1960s began with a five-month strike by workers over either wages and benefits (according to local newspapers), or unilateral work rules (according to the Industrial Union of Marine and Ship-building Workers). In the midst of the strike, the Navy towed , which was under conversion at the time, to the nearby Boston Navy Yard for completion, an action which prompted both laborers and management to negotiate a three-year contract and helped to nullify unpopular work rules. Later that year, the Long Beach was launched, which was a major achievement for the yard. SS Manhattan in 1969 1962 brought about the construction of , which was the largest commercial vessel built in the United States at the time, and became the first ship to transit the Northwest Passage to the Alaska North Slope oil fields. The Bainbridge was launched in that year, but not without accusations from the government that Bethlehem overcharged the Navy, as the costs increased from almost $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) in 1959 to a negotiated $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) three years later, down from an estimate of $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) before then, although there was a $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) discrepancy in the yard. After the end of the strike mentioned above, the yard was accused by the government of overcharging for the first nuclear frigate, and the Long Beach. The shipyard later made up for the losses of $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) by crediting on other contracts that were being offered. 1963 brought an end of an era to the yard, as Bethlehem put the yard up for sale. Fifty years of Bethlehem ownership, which began when the yard was near financial ruin, came to an end as the yard was one of the most established yards in the world. =General Dynamics Quincy Shipbuilding Division= Conversion of USS Muscle Shoals (formerly USNS Mission San Fernando) into USNS Vanguard In 1964, the yard was purchased by General Dynamics Corporation. J. William Jones, President of the company, stated that the yard was purchased in order to provide its Electric Boat division with increased flexibility. The yard was purchased for $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars), and Electric Boat managed the yard until its reorganization. Immediately, the yard was closed by Bethlehem Steel on 1 January 1964, and it was announced that thirteen hundred of the yard's employees would be retired or pensioned off immediately or within the next two years, leaving five hundred workers left. General Dynamics immediately invested $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) into various facilities in the yard, improving it in many ways. The yard was soon awarded the contract for the reconfiguration of the Apollo Instrumentation Ships from oilers. was converted into USNS Vanguard (T-AG-194), USNS Mission De Pala (T-AO-114) was converted to USNS Redstone (T-AGM-20), and was renamed USNS Mercury (T-AGM-21). Also in the 1960s, the yard modified and , and built and . Work began on and , both of which were ammunition ships, while construction began on the submarine tenders and . Around this time, the yard began construction of the Seabee barges, for the Lykes Brothers Steamship Company, which were the first modular construction ships built by General Dynamics at the yard, although they were sued by Lykes for late delivery off the ships. The addition of the Liquified natural gas tanker contracts in the early 1970s meant that the yard was due for another conversion. General Dynamics then invested $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) into more ways and wet basins in the yard, in order to be more competitive. The yard began construction of all of the Wichita-class replenishment oilers, with the exception of . Cost overruns were an issue with these ships, although eventually the costs were negotiated. Furthermore, the yard built four of the Anchorage-class dock landing ships, which were delivered between 1970 and 1972. These ships were involved in cost overruns as well, and in 1975 the Naval Sea Systems Command awarded the yard $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) for these overruns. The addition of modular construction to the yard meant that it could build ships by assembling pre-fabricated units, a technique that was used at the Victory Destroyer Plant during World War I. During the end of 1971, the yard was faced with declining contracts, which created rumors that the yard was close to closing. The yard was in discussion to gain a $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) contract for six supertankers, which would carry of crude oil each. These tankers were supposed to be constructed with a forty-three percent subsidy from the federal government, which was granted. Eventually though, funding fell through, and construction did not proceed on the ships. Despite this, the yard modified , which was a $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) contract, where the ship received new equipment. This contract provided one hundred jobs for the yard. The first attempt at government intervention for the yard came with Congressman James A. Burke aiming to stave off the imminent layoffs of two thousand workers. He attempted to get the yard awarded the contract for repairs to . In a telegram to then-Secretary of Defense Elliot Richardson, he said that the closure of the Boston Navy Yard created a labor surplus. Unfortunately for the yard, the contract never panned out. under construction, in 1971. Delivery of in 1973 meant that the only work at the yard consisted of the modification of the Hayes and construction of cylinders for submarines at Newport News Shipbuilding and Electric Boat, which helped to maintain work for about two hundred and eighty machine shop workers. Economic salvation came to the yard during the construction of LNG-41, which was calculated to bring 5,500 to 6,000 workers employment. Projected to begin in July 1973, the work was delayed until December due to delays in yard improvements. In the meantime, the Irving Sealion was repaired at the yard. The Esso Halifax, which struck an iceberg on the way to Resolute Bay in Nova Scotia was repaired in the yard during this time. The laying down of the LNG-41 occurred during the repair of , which was used to repair submarines at Naval Submarine Base New London. Congressman Burke was instrumental in securing this work, which kept the yard busy in 1974. That same year, a seventeen-week strike broke out, which created a situation where all work stopped and tanker work came to a halt. Eventually, the strike was resolved, but not before jeopardizing the future of the yard. After the settlement of the strike, was repaired at the yard in 1975, as General Dynamics had the lowest bid. In 1975, the yard had eight LNG contracts, which totaled $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars). It was around this time that the Goliath crane was constructed, which was a crane built for the construction of tankers. Until it was removed in 2008, it was the largest gantry crane in North America. The final construction project for the yard came in the form of construction of five 2nd Lieutenant John P. Bobo Class of Maritime Prepositioning ships. These ships could house equipment and supplies to house 4,000 Marines for thirty days, as well as everything they would need for combat. The ships were also designed to not need port facilities, as everything could be offloaded offshore. The ships were built by General Dynamics and initially were operated by General Dynamics' American Overseas Marine under a 25-year charter. The end of the construction of these ships in May 1986 meant that there was no longer any need for the yard, as attempts to secure container ships for United States Lines and survey ships for the Navy fell through. In 1986, the yard closed, with remaining employees either retiring or being laid off. In 1987, General Dynamics Quincy Shipbuilding Division ceased operation. The closure of the yard came after an unsuccessful attempt by employees to purchase the yard. On 1 June 1986, Fore River Shipyard closed for good. =Redevelopment= On the bridge of USS Salem, looking over the former yard in 2010 Goliath crane, January 2008 The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority pelletizing plant Closure of the division initially led to dormancy at the yard. Some equipment was sold off while other parts of the yard were used for staging areas of the Boston Harbor cleanup project. Various plans were then offered at the time for use of the shipyard. During this period, a ship scrapping operation, operating under the name Fore River Shipyard and Iron Works existed at one end of the yard. An initial purchase of five former Forrest Sherman-class destroyers was made, which included the , , , , and . Of these, Du Pont was the only one that was successfully scrapped, as the company concluded that the costs of scrapping the other ships would exceed their scrap value. The company later sought bankruptcy protection in 1994, and the remaining ships were sold to other scrap dealers by the Massachusetts Bankruptcy Court. In 1992, a group of volunteers came up with the idea of purchasing a ship built at the shipyard and relocating it to a new museum that would celebrate the history of the yard. In 1993, the United States Naval Shipbuilding Museum was established by the Massachusetts General Court with the aim to, \\"acquire, refurbish and maintain United States naval ships and the adjacent physical complex in order that it will [serve] as a major attraction for local citizens and tourists.\\" Initially, plans called for the purchase of , but the museum ended up getting , the last all-gun heavy cruiser ever built, returned to the Quincy yard after negotiations with the Naval Sea Systems Command. On 30 October 1994 Salem returned to Quincy to be permanently docked where she was built nearly five decades before. In May 2014, however, it was announced that the Salem would be moved to East Boston after the pier the ship was berthed and closed the previous September due to safety reasons. During the following summer, the ship reopened during one final season at the yard, with a planned move date to East Boston in 2016. In 1995, Sotirious Emmanouil purchased the former yard and promised to restore shipbuilding to the yard, through his company Massachusetts Heavy Industries. The company cleaned up much of the yard and built a handful of buildings after securing a $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) loan, but was unable to secure any contracts and became mired in disputes. The company eventually defaulted on its loans and the property was seized by the United States Maritime Administration in 2000, with its assets being auctioned off a few years later. Daniel J Quirk, a local auto dealer, bought the property in 2004 for use as a motor vehicle storage and distribution facility. Before the Great Recession hit, he publicized plans to redevelop the yard into condominiums and a living history exhibit, and cited Marina Bay, which is located at the old Victory Destroyer Plant and the Charlestown Navy Yard as examples of what he wanted to turn the yard into. In 2006, as he was trying to sell the Goliath crane, he acknowledged that if he was unable to sell it, he would probably have it scrapped due to it becoming dangerous due to ongoing deterioration of the structure. On 14 August 2008, ironworker Robert Harvey was killed when a portion of the Goliath crane collapsed during dismantlement. Work on the crane's removal was halted for two months while local and federal officials investigated the accident, but the work later resumed and was completed in early 2009. As a result of their investigation, on 13 January 2009 the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration imposed fines totalling $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars). A barge carrying the crane was christened USS Harvey in honor of the fallen worker and left the shipyard on 7 March 2009 en route to Romania. The August 2008 fatal incident was preceded by two other deaths involving demolition of the main gantry crane at the shipyard on 26 January 2005. The earlier incident resulted in an OSHA ruling against Testa Corporation of Lynnfield, Massachusetts, including a proposed $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) fine. Following the 2005 collapse, violations involving improper cleanup and removal of asbestos found in debris left by the accident resulted in a $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) penalty imposed against Testa by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection. The former shipyard served as a port for commuter boats to Boston run by Harbor Express for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). This service was discontinued in 2013 when a dock in Quincy was severely damaged. Currently, there are no plans to revive this service. The yard is also used by Jay Cashman, Inc., for heavy construction and marine equipment services, by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority as a sewage sludge heat-drying and pelletizing facility, and by Fore River Transportation Corporation for short line freight rail service to CSXT South Braintree. The yard has also been used as the main construction area for the new Fore River Bridge, which is located adjacent to the property. Although shipbuilding operations ceased in 1986, the name of the yard continues to be used, and the location is still referred to as Fore River Shipyard. Appearance in film Fore River Shipyard has also appeared in multiple films since it was closed. The climactic shootout from the 2006 film The Departed was filmed in the yard. In 2009, the film The Company Men was filmed at the site of the former yard. For the 2015 film The Finest Hours, sets are being constructed at the yard, along with a giant water tank. The film also used the former during production. Ships constructed at Fore River , in April 2020. During the almost one hundred years that the yard was operational, it produced hundreds of ships, submarines, and personal sailing vessels. Among these orders were the civilian ships the Barnacle and the multiple-masted schooners the Thomas W. Lawson and William L. Douglas. The yard also produced military contracts, including and . Additionally, submarines were constructed, including for the United States Navy, and others for both the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Royal Navy. As the yard was expanded over the years, it built battleships such as , , and the preserved , itself moored in Battleship Cove. Other naval ships include the preserved heavy cruiser (as part of the United States Naval Shipbuilding Museum adjacent to the shipyard), , and . Finally, the yard constructed multiple aircraft carriers, including the conversion of the battlecruiser USS Lexington CC-1's hull into , , , and . After the war, the yard found itself faced with changing realities, and increasingly relied on merchant marine ships, including , the first chemical transport ship in the United States. Furthermore, the yard also built passenger vessels, including , and . The last ships built at the yard were the 2nd Lieutenant John P. Bobo Class of Maritime Prepositioning ships. With the building of , the yard closed for good.

History Southwestern Adventist University Library Southwestern Adventist University was founded in 1893 as Keene Industrial Academy. The purchase of property for the school was financed by Seventh-day Adventists in the Dallas area. The first school building was completed in 1894 which was also used as a church. School opened with 56 students. The university adopted its current name in 1996. Southwestern Adventist University is located at the town of Keene, Texas, six miles northeast of Cleburne. Keene has been described as an Adventist \\"company\\" town. On Saturdays, the Sabbath for Adventists, most stores in town are closed. The Keene Seventh-day Adventist church has several thousand members. It is the Southwestern Adventist University church. The Seventh-day Adventist Church in America is divided into administrative units called unions, and most of these unions have a college. Most of these colleges were founded in the 1890s, a period of intense activity in Adventist history. The university evolved through several stages from Keene Industrial Academy to its present university status. At its beginning, it sold acreage to Adventist families and industries, and is now the largest Adventist community in the Southwestern Union, which includes Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and New Mexico. Academics During Fall 2014, Southwestern began to offer a Fire Science degree. The program is the only one of its kind among Seventh-day Adventist colleges and universities. Graduates of this program will receive a degree, as well as several technical certifications that will allow them to become employed by fire departments around the nation.

The film was based on the 2001 novel of the same name by Robert Crais, and was adapted for the screen by Doug Richardson. The film earned mixed to negative reviews and was not a financial success on its original release, earning only slightly more than its production costs. Plot Former L.A. SWAT officer Jeff Talley is a hostage negotiator in Los Angeles. One day, Talley negotiates with an abusive man who has taken his wife and son hostage after learning his wife was cheating on him. Shortly after Talley denies a SWAT commander's request to give snipers the order to open fire, the despondent man kills his wife, son, and himself. Traumatized, Talley moves with his family and becomes police chief in Bristo Camino, a fictional suburban hamlet in nearby Ventura County. A year later, Talley finds himself in another hostage situation. Two troubled teenaged brothers, Dennis and Kevin Kelly, and a sociopathic accomplice, Marshall \\"Mars\\" Krupcheck, all very well-armed, take Walter Smith and his two children, Jennifer and Tommy, hostage in the Smith home after a failed robbery attempt. Dennis had told his younger brother to wait in the car, not anticipating the siege to come, but Kevin refused. A female police officer, Carol Flores, responds after Tommy turns on the silent alarm. She is shot twice by Mars after being informed by dispatch that the red truck (parked by the hostage takers in front of the house) is a stolen vehicle just before Talley arrives. She dies in front of him. Traumatized and unwilling to put himself through another tragedy, Talley hands authority over to the county sheriff and leaves. Smith had been laundering money for a mysterious right-wing militia and mafia syndicate through offshore shell corporations. He was preparing to turn over a batch of important encrypted files recorded on a DVD when he was taken hostage. To prevent the incriminating evidence from being discovered, the syndicate orders one of their men, a ruthless operative, known as \\"the Watchman\\", to kidnap Talley's wife and daughter. Talley is instructed by \\"the Watchman\\", to return to the hostage scene, regain authority, and stall for time until the organization can launch its own attack against Smith's house. Otherwise, Talley's wife and daughter will be murdered. Dennis forces Kevin and Mars to tie up the children, while he knocks out Smith and finds a small fortune in cash, money which the syndicate had paid Smith. In an attempt to end the standoff and secure the DVDs himself, Talley meets with Dennis and agrees to provide a helicopter in exchange for half of the money. When the helicopter arrives, Dennis and Kevin bring the money to Talley and prepare to leave, but Mars refuses to leave without Jennifer, with whom he has become infatuated. Talley says the helicopter will only carry three passengers and insists Jennifer stay behind, but the deal breaks down and the boys and Jennifer return to the house. Talley learns that Mars is a sociopath who could turn on the hostages and his own accomplices at any moment. Mars does, in fact, kill Kevin, just as Kevin is about to release the children. Mars then kills Dennis. The syndicate dispatches fake FBI agents to recover the DVD and they storm the house; Talley is instructed to not go near the house. Jennifer manages to stab Mars, but not fatally, and locks herself and Tommy in the panic room. Hearing their screams, Talley breaches the house and is attacked by Mars, who then kills most of the fake agents using his pistol and multiple homemade Molotov cocktails. Mars is then shot in the side by the only surviving agent. The agent tracks down Talley and the children, and demands the encrypted DVD. When Talley asks that the children be allowed to leave, the fake agent shoots Talley, but it is not a fatal wound. After Talley gives him the DVD, Mars reappears, carrying two homemade Molotov cocktails, distracting the agent long enough to be killed by Talley. Mars then prepares to throw his last Molotov, but collapses to his knees, weakened by his injuries. He makes eye contact with Jennifer, then drops the Molotov and immolates himself. Talley escapes with the children by shooting the indoor glass waterfall, which extinguishes the fire caused by Mars' first Molotov. He and a recovered Smith then go to a rundown inn where Talley's wife and daughter are being held captive by the Watchman and his crew. Smith, feigning hatred for Talley, is freed in exchange for the family. While demanding that the Watchman kill Talley, Smith shoots the Watchman in the head. This allows Talley to kill the other gunmen in similar fashion and rescue his own family.

The main difference is that the novel's complicated subplot involving powerful West Coast Mafia crime lord Sonny Benza was removed, with the film giving little explanation of Walter Smith's criminal associates. The film also makes the first group of hostage-takers somewhat younger in age than depicted in the novel. In addition, the criminal syndicate in the film were portrayed as domestic right-wing extremists rather than a Mafia. Filming took place in the Malibu area (in western Los Angeles County). The exterior views of Smith's lavishly appointed house were filmed at a real house in the unincorporated Topanga Canyon area, between Malibu and Los Angeles; the interior scenes were done on sound stages in Hollywood. The character Mars, played by Ben Foster, was modeled after Bay Area rap artist Mars by Robert Crais after a friend Dennis Bsharah urged him to look into the horrorcore genre. In the movie adaptation, Foster strongly resembles the rapper. Jonathan Tucker's name was later changed to Dennis. The movie's opening scenes were filmed in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of East Los Angeles, just east of downtown. The fictional city of Bristo Camino was possibly intended to be a representation of Ojai or Moorpark. Bristo Bay is the name of Bristo Camino in the 2001 Robert Crais novel.

The Aeta (Ayta ; Kapampangan: √°it√¢), or Agta, are an indigenous people who live in scattered, isolated mountainous parts of the island of Luzon, the Philippines. These people are considered to be Negritos, whose skin ranges from dark to very dark brown, and possessing features such as a small stature and frame; hair of a curly to kinky texture and a higher frequency of naturally lighter colour (blondism) relative to the general population, small nose, and dark brown eyes. They are thought to be among the earliest inhabitants of the Philippines, preceding the Austronesian migrations. The Aeta were included in the group of people named \\"Negrito\\" during the Spanish Era. Various Aeta groups in northern Luzon are named Pugut or Pugot, an Ilocano term that also means \\"goblin\\" or \\"forest spirit\\", and is the colloquial term for people with darker complexions. As nomadic people, Aeta communities typically consist of approximately 1 to 5 families of mobile group. So the word Aeta or Agta is frequently used as an umbrella term for numerous Aeta groups in the Philippines, considering their varied locations in Luzon, including some living in parts of Visayas and Mindanao. Groups under the ‚ÄúAeta‚Äù umbrella are normally referred to after their demographic locations. Scholars (particularly anthropologists and ethnographers) focusing on the Aeta communities tend to follow this particular naming to also account for cultural variations (most notably, in language) for each individual group. Aeta of Magbukun (also called Aeta of Bataan), Casiguran Dumagat Agta, Aeta of Zambales (also called Aeta of Mt. Pinatubo), Aeta of San Mariano Isabela, and Agta of Lamika, are some of the Aeta communities in the Philippine archipelago. Young Aeta boy from Iriga City, Camarines Sur, in 2015. History Aetas as illustrated in Carta Hydrographica y Chorographica de las Yslas Filipinas, 1734. The caption in Spanish describes them as \\"wild men of the mountains\\".An artist's illustration of Aetas in 1885. The Aeta people in the Philippines are often grouped with other Negritos, such as the Semang on the Malay Peninsula, and sometimes grouped with Australo-Melanesians, which includes groups such as the natives of Australia; Papuans; and the Melanesians of the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, and the French overseas special collectivity of New Caledonia. Aeta hunters, as depicted in the Boxer Codex (c. 1595). The history of the Aetas continues to confound anthropologists and archaeologists. One theory suggests that the Aeta are the descendants of the original inhabitants of the Philippines, who, contrary to their seafaring Austronesian neighbors, arrived through land bridges that linked the islands with the Asian mainland. Unlike many of their Austronesian counterparts, the Aetas have shown resistance to change. Aetas had little interaction with the Spaniards as they remained in the mountains during the Spanish rule. Even the attempts of the Spaniards failed to settle them in reducciones or reservations all throughout Spanish rule. According to Spanish observers like Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi, Negritos possessed iron tools and weapons. Their speed and accuracy with a bow and arrow were proverbial and they were fearsome warriors. Unwary travelers or field workers were often easy targets. Despite their martial prowess, however, the Aeta's small numbers, primitive economy and lack of organization often made them easy prey for better-organized groups. Zambals seeking people to enslave would often take advantage of their internal feuding. They were often enslaved and sold to Borneo and China, and, unlike the serf feudal system imposed on other Filipinos, there was little chance of manumission.  Demographics  In 2010, there were 50,236 Aeta people in the Philippines.  Ancestral lands  Aetas are found in Zambales, Tarlac, Pampanga, Panay, Bataan, and Nueva Ecija, but were forced to move to resettlement areas in Pampanga and Tarlac following the devastating Mount Pinatubo eruption in June 1991. Some Aeta communities have received government land titles recognizing their claims to their ancestral lands. A total of 454 Aeta families in Floridablanca, Pampanga, received their Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title (CADT) on May 27, 2009. The title covers 7,440.10 hectares in San Marcelino and Brgy. Batiawan in Zambales and barangays Mawakat and Nabuklod in Floridablanca. It was the first time clean ancestral domain titles were distributed by the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples. The Aeta Abellen community of Sitio Maporac, Barangay New San Juan, Cabangan, Zambales, received the first Philippine‚Äôs first Certificate of Ancestral Domain Claim (CADC) on March 8, 1996. The CADT was acquired 16 years later in December 2010. Lifestyle Aeta lady washing clothes in Iriga City. The Aeta are nomadic and build only temporary shelters made of sticks driven to the ground and covered with the palm of banana leaves. The more modernized Aetas have moved to villages and areas of cleared mountains. They live in houses made of bamboo and cogon grass. Mining, deforestation, illegal logging, and slash-and-burn farming have caused the indigenous population in the country to steadily decrease to the point where they number only in the thousands today. The Philippine government affords them little or no protection, and the Aeta have become extremely nomadic due to social and economic strain on their culture and way of life that had previously remained unchanged for thousands of years. As hunter-gatherers, adaptation plays an important role in Aeta communities to survive. This often includes gaining knowledge about the tropical forest that they live in, the typhoon cycles that travel through their area, and other seasonal weather changes that affect the behavior of the flora and fauna in their location. Another important survival skill is storytelling. Like many other hunter-gatherer societies, the Aeta promote social values, such as cooperation, through stories. Thus, they highly value skilled storytellers. Dry season for many Aeta communities means intense work. They not only hunt and fish more, the start of the dry season also means swiddening the land for future harvest. While the clearing of land is done by both men and women, Aeta women tend to do most of the harvesting. During this period, they also do business transactions with non-Aeta communities living around the vicinity they temporarily settled in either to sell the food they gathered, or to work as temporary farmers or field laborers. Aeta women play more active roles in business transactions with non-Aeta communities, mostly as traders and agricultural workers for lowland farmers. While dry season typically means bountiful food for Aetas, rainy season (which often falls in the Philippines between September and December) often provides the opposite experience, considering the difficulties of traversing flooded and wet forests for hunting and gathering. Aeta communities use different tools in their hunting and gathering activities. Traditional tools include traps, knives, and bow and arrow, with different types of arrow points for specialized purposes. Most Aetas are trained for hunting and gathering at age 15, including Aeta women. While men and some women typically use the standard bow and arrow, most Aeta women prefer knives and often hunt with their dogs and in groups to increase efficiency and for social reasons. Fishing and food gathering are also done by both males and females. In terms of gender, then, Aeta communities are more egalitarian in structure and in practice. Language All Aeta communities have adopted the language of their Austronesian Filipino neighbors, which have sometimes diverged over time to become different languages.Reid, Lawrence. 1987. \\"The early switch hypothesis\\". Man and Culture in Oceania, 3 Special Issue: 41-59. These include, in order of number of speakers, Mag-indi, Mag-antsi, Abellen, Ambala, and Marivele√±o. Religion Aetas performing on stage at a shopping center. =Indigenous monotheistic religion= There are different views on the dominant character of the Aeta religion. Those who believe they are monotheistic argue that various Aeta tribes believe in a supreme being who rules over lesser spirits or deities, with the Aeta of Mt. Pinatubo worshipping \\"Apo Na\\". The Aetas are also animists. For example, the Pinatubo Aeta believe in environmental spirits. They believe that good and evil spirits inhabit the environment, such as the spirits of the river, sea, sky, mountain, hill, valley and other places. No special occasion is needed for the Aeta to pray, but there is a clear link between prayer and economic activities. The Aeta dance before and after a pig hunt. The night before Aeta women gather shellfish, they perform a dance which is partly an apology to the fish and partly a charm to ensure the catch. Similarly, the men hold a bee dance before and after the expeditions for honey. =Indigenous polytheistic religion= There are four manifestations of the \\"great creator\\" who rules the world: Tigbalog is the source of life and action; Lueve takes care of production and growth; Amas moves people to pity, love, unity, and peace of heart; while Binangewan is responsible for change, sickness, and death. *Gutugutumakkan ‚Äì The Supreme Being and Great Creator who have four manifestations, namely, Tigbalog, Lueve, Amas, and Binangewan. *Kedes - The god of the hunt. *Pawi - The god of the forest. *Sedsed - The god of the sea. =Colonial religion= In the mid-1960s, missionaries of the American-based Evangelical Protestant mission group New Tribes Mission, in their effort to reach every Philippine tribal group with the Christian Gospel, reached out to the Agtas/Aetas. The mission agency provided education, including pastoral training for natives to reach members of their own tribe. Today, a large percentage of Agtas/Aetas of Zambales and Pampanga are Evangelicals. Jehovah's Witnesses also have members of the Aeta people. (See 1993 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses) Clothing Their traditional clothing is very plain. The young women wear wrap around skirts. Elder women wear bark cloth, while elder men wear loin cloths. The old women of the Agta wear a bark cloth strip which passes between the legs, and is attached to a string around the waist. Today, most Aeta who have been in contact with lowlanders have adopted the T-shirts, pants and rubber sandals commonly used by the latter. Practices Varanus bitatawa stew being prepared by Aeta tribesmen. The Aetas are skillful in weaving and plaiting. Women exclusively weave winnows and mats. Only men make armlets. They also produce raincoats made of palm leaves whose bases surround the neck of the wearer, and whose topmost part spreads like a fan all around the body. According to one study, \\"About 85% of Philippine Aeta women hunt, and they hunt the same quarry as men. Aeta women hunt in groups and with dogs, and have a 31% success rate as opposed to 17% for men. Their rates are even better when they combine forces with men: mixed hunting groups have a full 41% success rate among the Aeta.\\" Medicine Aeta women are known around the country as experts of the herbal medicines. Among the Aeta community in Ilagan, Isabela for example, banana leaves are used to cure toothache. They also bathe themselves with cooled-down water boiled with camphor leaves (subusob) to help alleviate fever, or they make herbal teas out of the camphor leaves that they then drink thrice a day if the fever and cold still persist. For muscle pains, they drink herbal teas extracted from kalulong leaves and have the patient take it thrice a day. In order to prevent relapse after giving birth, women also bathe themselves in cooled-down water boiled with sahagubit roots. The drinking of sahagubit herbal tea is likewise recommended to deworm Aeta children, or generally to alleviate stomachache. For birth control purposes, Aeta women drink wine made out of lukban (pomelo) root. They are, however, not advised to drink herbal tea from makahiya extract even if it's also used to elevate stomachache problems due to the belief that it will cause abortion. The idea behind this is that like the closing of makahiya leaves once touched, the womb may also close once the makahiya touches it. The Aeta in Isabela also recommend drinking herbal tea out of wormwood (herbaca) leaves or stem to address women's irregular menstrual cycle. They take herbal teas from lemon grass (barbaraniw) extract thrice a day to normalize blood pressure. If the illness persists even after continuous drinking of recommended herbal medicine, that's when they seek the help of an herbolario (or soothsayer). They do so because the Aeta believe that their illnesses are caused by a spirit that they may have offended, in which case herbal medicines or medical doctors won't be able to address. In order to appease the spirits, they ask the herbolario to perform a ritual called ud- udung. In this ritual, the herbolario places rice or raw eggs on the patient's forehead first to determine what causes the illness and repeats this several times to confirm. After the herbolario is satisfied, the patient will be asked to bathe with ricewash, and then to offer food to appease the offended spirit. The Aeta communities take pride in their use of herbal medicines and their own natural ways of curing the sick. Finding their main source of herbal medicines in their habitat rather than buying costly medicines, emphasizing the mutual relationship with the nature, also has a great attitudinal impact pertaining to sustainability approach and practices in healthcare. Art A traditional form of visual art is body scarification. The Aetas intentionally wound the skin on their back, arms, breast, legs, hands, calves and abdomen, and then they irritate the wounds with fire, lime and other means to form scars. Other \\"decorative disfigurements\\" include the chipping of the teeth. With the use of a file, the Dumagat modify their teeth during late puberty. The teeth are dyed black a few years afterwards. The Aetas generally use ornaments typical of people living in subsistence economies. Flowers and leaves are used as earplugs for certain occasions. Girdles, necklaces, and neckbands of braided rattan incorporated with wild pig bristles are frequently worn. Music The Aeta have a musical heritage consisting of various types of agung ensembles, ensembles composed of large hanging, suspended or held, bossed/knobbed gongs, which act as drone, without any accompanying melodic instrument.  Traditional political organization  While the father is normally the figurehead of the family, Aeta communities or bands traditionally had an anarchic political structure wherein they don't have appointed chiefs to exercise authority over them. Individual Aeta is on equal grounds with the other and their main course of social interaction is through their tradition. It's also the tradition, and not constituted laws, that maintain the equality among them and guide their way of life. They do have groups of elders in their community, called pisen, who they tend to go to when it comes to arbitrating decisions. However, the decisions made by the elders only remain in advisory capacity and no one could force any individual to follow those decisions. Their guiding principle and conflict resolution is through a sustained deliberation. Over time, this egalitarian political structure was disturbed due to recurring contacts with the lowland Filipinos wherein the local officials and individuals they interact with forced Aeta communities to create government structure resembling those in the lowlands. At times, Aeta communities do organize themselves in government-like system with a Capitan (Captain), Conseyal (Council) and Policia (Police). But mostly, they resist such imposed organization. In particular, they refuse to appoint a chief (or a president) that will govern them although they do have one elder that takes the responsibility of leadership. This informal kind of government can also be found in their judicial process. When someone in their community did something wrong, they would deliberate about it but more importantly, they don't talk about what kind of punishment they will hand to the wrong-doer but instead the deliberation is about understanding the motivation behind the action and prevent the consequence of the action from developing into something worse. Young men and women are excluded from the deliberation process. In this particular case, women are also largely excluded from the deliberation process even when they are allowed to attend the hearing or even when sometimes they can make their opinion about the problem. For the most part, women are not given room within the decision making process because the Aeta communities also follow a strict gender role were women are mostly expected take care of the children and the husband.

Something goes into the bit bucket when it is deleted, generally irreversibly and quite often wrongly, such as files or emails that just disappear. It has been commonly suggested that this usage dates from the days when punched cards and/or punched tape were common. Card and paper-tape punches each had a receptacle for the chips punched from the cards or tape to create the holes (rectangular in a card, round in a paper tape), which often looked like a bucket and was known by this name.

An Irish Flora. Dundalgan Press (W.Tempest) Ltd. Dundalk Via human introduction it is now present across much of the Northern Hemisphere and is considered an invasive species in many areas. Uprooting or cutting the plants is an effective means of control. Etymology The common names policeman's helmet, bobby tops, copper tops, and gnome's hatstand all originate from the flowers being decidedly hat- shaped. Himalayan balsam and kiss-me-on-the-mountain arise from the plant originating in the Himalayan mountains. Ornamental jewelweed refers to its cultivation as an ornamental plant. The genus name Impatiens, meaning \\"impatient\\", refers to its method of seed dispersal. The species name glandulifera comes from the Latin words gl√°ndula meaning 'small gland', and ferre meaning 'to bear', referring to the plant's glands. Description Impatiens glandulifera scattering its seeds Leaves of the Himalayan Balsam Glands It typically grows to high, with a soft green or red-tinged stem, and lanceolate leaves long. The crushed foliage has a strong musty smell. Below the leaf stems the plant has glands that produce a sticky, sweet-smelling, and edible nectar. The flowers are pink, with a hooded shape, 3 to 4 cm ( to in) tall and 2 cm ( in) broad; the flower shape has been compared to a policeman's helmet. After flowering between June and October, the plant forms seed pods 2 to 3 cm ( to in) long and 8 mm broad ( in), which explode when disturbed,Scott, R. 2004. Wild Belfast on safari in the city. Blackstaff Press. scattering the seeds up to . The green seed pods, seeds, young leaves and shoots are all edible. The flowers can be turned into a jam or parfait. The plant was rated in first place for per day nectar production per flower in a UK plants survey conducted by the AgriLand project which is supported by the UK Insect Pollinators Initiative. (However, when number of flowers per floral unit, flower abundance, and phenology were taken into account it dropped out of the top 10 for most nectar per unit cover per year, as did all plants that placed in the top ten along with this one for per day nectar production per flower, with the exception of Common Comfrey, Symphytum officinale.) Distribution Himalayan balsam is native to the Himalayas, specifically to the areas between Kashmir and Uttarakhand. In its native range it is usually found in altitudes between 2000‚Äì2500 m above sea level, although it has been reported in up to 4000 m above sea level. In Europe the plant was first introduced in the United Kingdom where it has become naturalized and widespread across riverbanks. Presently it can be found almost everywhere across the continent.Scannell, M.J.P. and Synnott, D.M. 1972. Census Catalogue of the Flora of Ireland. Dublin. Published by the Stationery Office.Hackney, P. (Ed)1992. Stewart & Corry's Flora of the North-East of Ireland. The Institute of Irish Studies, The Queen's University of Belfast. In North America it has been found in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland. In the United States it is found on both the east and west coast, seemingly restricted to northern latitudes. In New Zealand it is sometimes found growing wild along riverbanks and wetlands. Invasive species Himalayan balsam is sometimes cultivated for its flowers. It is now widely established in other parts of the world (such as the British Isles and North America), in some cases becoming a weed. Its aggressive seed dispersal, coupled with high nectar production which attracts pollinators, often allow it to outcompete native plants. Himalayan balsam also promotes river bank erosion due to the plant dying back over winter, leaving the bank unprotected from flooding. Invasive Himalayan balsam can also adversely affect indigenous species by attracting pollinators (e.g. insects) at the expense of indigenous species. It is considered a \\"prohibited noxious weed\\" under the Alberta Weed Control Act 2010. In the UK, the plant was first introduced in 1839, at the same time as giant hogweed and Japanese knotweed. These plants were all promoted at the time as having the virtues of \\"herculean proportions\\" and \\"splendid invasiveness\\" which meant that ordinary people could buy them for the cost of a packet of seeds to rival the expensive orchids grown in the greenhouses of the rich. Within ten years, however, Himalayan balsam had escaped from the confines of cultivation and begun to spread along the river systems of England. It has now spread across most of the UK, and some local wildlife trusts organise \\"balsam bashing\\" events to help control the plant. However, a study by Hejda & Py≈°ek (2006) concluded that, in some circumstances, such efforts may cause more harm than good. Destroying riparian stands of Himalayan balsam can open up the habitat for more aggressive invasive plants such as Japanese knotweed and aid in seed dispersal by dropped seeds sticking to shoes. Riparian habitat is suboptimal for I. glandulifera, and spring or autumn flooding destroys seeds and plants. The research suggests that the best way to control the spread of riparian Himalayan balsam is to decrease eutrophication, thereby permitting the better-adapted local vegetation, that gets outgrown by the balsam on watercourses with high nutrient load, to rebound naturally. The researchers caution that their conclusions probably do not hold true for stands of the plant at forest edges and meadow habitats, where manual destruction is still the best approach. The Bionic Control of Invasive Weeds project, in Wiesbaden, Germany, is trying to establish a self-sufficient means of conserving their local biodiversity by developing several food products made from the Himalayan balsam flowers. If all goes well, the project will have it financing its own eradication. In August 2014, CABI released a rust fungus in Berkshire, Cornwall and Middlesex in the United Kingdom as part of field trials into the biological control of Himalayan balsam. Some research also suggests that I. glandulifera may exhibit allelopathy, which means that it excretes toxins that negatively affect neighboring plants, thus increasing its competitive advantage. The Royal Horticultural Society and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology recommend that pulling and cutting is the main method of non-chemical control, and usually the most appropriate. Natural Resources Wales has used manual methods, such as pulling plants and using strimmers, to largely eradicate Himalayan Balsam from reaches of the River Ystwyth.

The J35 was fairly simple, consisting of an eleven-stage axial-flow compressor and a single-stage turbine. With the afterburner, which most models carried, it produced a thrust of . A J35 with exhaust duct removed Like the J33, the design of the J35 originated at General Electric, but major production was by the Allison Engine Company. Design and development While developing the T31 axial turboprop in 1943 GE realized that they had the resources to design an axial turbojet at the same time as their centrifugal J33 engine. They recognized the axial would have more potential for the future and went ahead with the TG-180 engine. GE axial compressor designs were developed from the NACA 8-stage compressor. Allison J35 (GE), 1947 (National Naval Aviation Museum, Pensacola, FL). Cutaway of J35 combustor dome Cutaway of J35 fuel atomizer The engine had its starter and accessories (fuel control, fuel pump, oil pumps, hydraulic pump, RPM generator) mounted in the center of the compressor inlet. This accessory layout, as used on centrifugal engines, restricted the area available for compressor inlet air. It was carried over to the J47 but revised (relocated to an external gearbox) on the J73 when a 50% increase in airflow was required. It also had an inlet debris guard which was common on early jet engines. GE developed a variable afterburner for the engine, although electronic control linked with engine controls had to wait until the J47. Marrett describes one of the consequences if the link is human on an afterburning engine. If the afterburner lit but the nozzle didn't open (not noticed by the pilot) the RPM governor would overfuel the engine until the turbine failed. Operational history The General Electric J35 first flew in the Republic XP-84 Thunderjet in 1946. Late in 1947, complete responsibility for the development and production of the engine was transferred to the Allison Division of the General Motors Corporation and some J35s were also built by GM's Chevrolet division. More than 14,000 J35s had been built by the time production ended in 1955. The J35 was used to power the Bell X-5 variable-sweep research aircraft and various prototypes such as the Douglas XB-43 Jetmaster, North American XB-45 Tornado, Convair XB-46, Boeing XB-47 Stratojet, Martin XB-48, and Northrop YB-49. It is probably best known, however, as the engine used in two of the leading fighters of the United States Air Force (USAF) in the 1950s: the Republic F-84 Thunderjet and the Northrop F-89 Scorpion. A largely redesigned development, the J35-A-23, was later produced as the Allison J71, developing thrust.

It was developed by Gingold and Monaghan and Lucy in 1977, initially for astrophysical problems. It has been used in many fields of research, including astrophysics, ballistics, volcanology, and oceanography. It is a meshfree Lagrangian method (where the co-ordinates move with the fluid), and the resolution of the method can easily be adjusted with respect to variables such as density.  Method  = Advantages = * By construction, SPH is a meshfree method, which makes it ideally suited to simulate problems dominated by complex boundary dynamics, like free surface flows, or large boundary displacement. * The lack of a mesh significantly simplifies the model implementation and its parallelization, even for many-core architectures. * SPH can be easily extended to a wide variety of fields, and hybridized with some other models, as discussed in Modelling Physics. * As discussed in section on weakly compressible SPH, the method has great conservation features. * The computational cost of SPH simulations per number of particles is significantly less than the cost of grid-based simulations per number of cells when the metric of interest is related to fluid density (e.g., the probability density function of density fluctuations). This is the case because in SPH the resolution is put where the matter is. = Limitations = * Setting boundary conditions in SPH such as inlets and outlets and walls is more difficult than with grid-based methods. In fact, it has been stated that \\"the treatment of boundary conditions is certainly one of the most difficult technical points of the SPH method\\". This challenge is partly because in SPH the particles near the boundary change with time. Nonetheless, wall boundary conditions for SPH are available * The computational cost of SPH simulations per number of particles is significantly larger than the cost of grid-based simulations per number of cells when the metric of interest is not (directly) related to density (e.g., the kinetic- energy spectrum). Therefore, overlooking issues of parallel speedup, the simulation of constant-density flows (e.g., external aerodynamics) is more efficient with grid-based methods than with SPH.  Examples  = Fluid dynamics = Fig. SPH simulation of ocean waves using FLUIDS v.1 (Hoetzlein) Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics is being increasingly used to model fluid motion as well. This is due to several benefits over traditional grid-based techniques. First, SPH guarantees conservation of mass without extra computation since the particles themselves represent mass. Second, SPH computes pressure from weighted contributions of neighboring particles rather than by solving linear systems of equations. Finally, unlike grid-based techniques, which must track fluid boundaries, SPH creates a free surface for two-phase interacting fluids directly since the particles represent the denser fluid (usually water) and empty space represents the lighter fluid (usually air). For these reasons, it is possible to simulate fluid motion using SPH in real time. However, both grid-based and SPH techniques still require the generation of renderable free surface geometry using a polygonization technique such as metaballs and marching cubes, point splatting, or 'carpet' visualization. For gas dynamics it is more appropriate to use the kernel function itself to produce a rendering of gas column density (e.g., as done in the SPLASH visualisation package). One drawback over grid-based techniques is the need for large numbers of particles to produce simulations of equivalent resolution. In the typical implementation of both uniform grids and SPH particle techniques, many voxels or particles will be used to fill water volumes that are never rendered. However, accuracy can be significantly higher with sophisticated grid-based techniques, especially those coupled with particle methods (such as particle level sets), since it is easier to enforce the incompressibility condition in these systems. SPH for fluid simulation is being used increasingly in real-time animation and games where accuracy is not as critical as interactivity. Recent work in SPH for fluid simulation has increased performance, accuracy, and areas of application: * B.

Esmail-Yakas, 2020, propose a general, efficient and simple method for evaluating normalisation factors near piecewise-planar boundaries = Astrophysics = Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics's adaptive resolution, numerical conservation of physically conserved quantities, and ability to simulate phenomena covering many orders of magnitude make it ideal for computations in theoretical astrophysics. Simulations of galaxy formation, star formation, stellar collisions, supernovae and meteor impacts are some of the wide variety of astrophysical and cosmological uses of this method. SPH is used to model hydrodynamic flows, including possible effects of gravity. Incorporating other astrophysical processes which may be important, such as radiative transfer and magnetic fields is an active area of research in the astronomical community, and has had some limited success.http://users.monash.edu.au/~dprice/pubs/spmhd/price-spmhd.pdf = Solid mechanics = Libersky and Petschek extended SPH to Solid Mechanics. The main advantage of SPH in this application is the possibility of dealing with larger local distortion than grid-based methods. This feature has been exploited in many applications in Solid Mechanics: metal forming, impact, crack growth, fracture, fragmentation, etc. Another important advantage of meshfree methods in general, and of SPH in particular, is that mesh dependence problems are naturally avoided given the meshfree nature of the method. In particular, mesh alignment is related to problems involving cracks and it is avoided in SPH due to the isotropic support of the kernel functions. However, classical SPH formulations suffer from tensile instabilities and lack of consistency. Over the past years, different corrections have been introduced to improve the accuracy of the SPH solution, leading to the RKPM by Liu et al. Randles and Libersky and Johnson and Beissel tried to solve the consistency problem in their study of impact phenomena. Dyka et al. and Randles and Libersky introduced the stress-point integration into SPH and Ted Belytschko et al. showed that the stress-point technique removes the instability due to spurious singular modes, while tensile instabilities can be avoided by using a Lagrangian kernel. Many other recent studies can be found in the literature devoted to improve the convergence of the SPH method. Recent improvements in understanding the convergence and stability of SPH have allowed for more widespread applications in Solid Mechanics. Other examples of applications and developments of the method include: * Metal forming simulations. * SPH-based method SPAM (Smoothed Particle Applied Mechanics) for impact fracture in solids by William G. Hoover. * Modified SPH (SPH/MLSPH) for fracture and fragmentation. * Taylor-SPH (TSPH) for shock wave propagation in solids. * Generalized coordinate SPH (GSPH) allocates particles inhomogeneously in the Cartesian coordinate system and arranges them via mapping in a generalized coordinate system in which the particles are aligned at a uniform spacing.  Numerical tools  = Interpolations = The smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method works by dividing the fluid into a set of discrete moving elements i,j , referred to as particles. Their Lagrangian nature allows setting their position \\\\mathbf{r}_i by integration of their velocity \\\\mathbf{v}_i as: : \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{r}_i}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}=\\\\boldsymbol{v}_i. These particles interact through a kernel function with characteristic radius known as the \\"smoothing length\\", typically represented in equations by h . This means that the physical quantity of any particle can be obtained by summing the relevant properties of all the particles that lie within the range of the kernel, the latter being used as a weighting function W . This can be understood in two steps. First an arbitrary field A is written as a convolution with W : : A(\\\\boldsymbol{r}) = \\\\int A\\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{r^{\\\\prime}}\\\\right) W( \\\\boldsymbol{r}-\\\\boldsymbol{r^{\\\\prime}} ,h) \\\\mathrm{d}V\\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{r^{\\\\prime}}\\\\right). The error in making the above approximation is order h^2 . Secondly, the integral is approximated using a Riemann summation over the particles: : A(\\\\boldsymbol{r}) = \\\\sum_j V_j A_j W( \\\\boldsymbol{r}-\\\\boldsymbol{r}_{j} ,h), where the summation over j includes all particles in the simulation. V_j is the volume of particle j , A_j is the value of the quantity A for particle j and \\\\boldsymbol{r} denotes position. For example, the density \\\\rho_i of particle i can be expressed as: : \\\\rho_i = \\\\rho(\\\\boldsymbol{r}_i) = \\\\sum_j m_j W_{ij}, where m_j = \\\\rho_j V_j denotes the particle mass and \\\\rho_j the particle density, while W_{ij}=W_{ji} is a short notation for W( \\\\boldsymbol{r}_i-\\\\boldsymbol{r}_j ,h) . The error done in approximating the integral by a discrete sum depends on h , on the particle size (i.e. V_j^{1/d} , d being the space dimension), and on the particle arrangement in space. The latter effect is still poorly known. Kernel functions commonly used include the Gaussian function, the quintic spline and the Wendland C^2 kernel. The latter two kernels are compactly supported (unlike the Gaussian, where there is a small contribution at any finite distance away), with support proportional to h . This has the advantage of saving computational effort by not including the relatively minor contributions from distant particles. Although the size of the smoothing length can be fixed in both space and time, this does not take advantage of the full power of SPH. By assigning each particle its own smoothing length and allowing it to vary with time, the resolution of a simulation can be made to automatically adapt itself depending on local conditions. For example, in a very dense region where many particles are close together, the smoothing length can be made relatively short, yielding high spatial resolution. Conversely, in low-density regions where individual particles are far apart and the resolution is low, the smoothing length can be increased, optimising the computation for the regions of interest. = Operators = For particles of constant mass, differentiating the interpolated density \\\\rho_i with respect to time yields : \\\\frac{d\\\\rho_i}{dt} = \\\\sum_j m_j \\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{v}_i - \\\\boldsymbol{v}_j\\\\right) \\\\cdot abla W_{ij}, where abla W_{ij}=- abla W_{ji} is the gradient of W_{ij} with respect to \\\\boldsymbol{r}_i . Comparing the above equation with the continuity equation in continuum mechanics shows that the right-hand side is an approximation of -\\\\rho abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v} ; hence one defines a discrete divergence operator as follows: : \\\\operatorname{D}_i\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\boldsymbol{v}_j \\\\right\\\\\\\\} = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho_i} \\\\sum_j m_j \\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{v}_i - \\\\boldsymbol{v}_j\\\\right) \\\\cdot abla W_{ij}. This operator gives an SPH approximation of abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v} at the particle i for a given set of particles with given masses m_j , positions \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathbf{r}_j \\\\right\\\\\\\\} and velocities \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathbf{v}_j \\\\right\\\\\\\\} . Similarly, one can define a discrete gradient operator to approximate the pressure gradient at the position of particle i : : \\\\operatorname{\\\\mathbf{G}}_i\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ p_j \\\\right\\\\\\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho_i} \\\\sum_j m_j \\\\left(\\\\frac{p_i}{\\\\rho_i^2} + \\\\frac{p_j}{\\\\rho_j^2}\\\\right) abla W_{ij}, where \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ p_j \\\\right\\\\\\\\} denote the set of particle pressures. There are several ways to define discrete operators in SPH; the above divergence and gradient formulae have the property to be skew-adjoint, leading to nice conservation properties. On the other hand, while the divergence operator \\\\operatorname{D} is zero-order consistent, it can be seen that the approximate gradient \\\\operatorname{\\\\mathbf{G}} is not so. Several techniques have been proposed to circumvent this issue, leading to renormalised operators (see e.g.). = Governing equations = The SPH operators can be used to discretize numbers of partial differential equations. For a compressible inviscid fluid, the Euler equations of mass conservation and momentum balance read: : \\\\frac{d\\\\rho}{dt} = -\\\\rho abla\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{v} : \\\\frac{d\\\\boldsymbol{v}}{dt} = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho} abla p + \\\\boldsymbol{g} All kinds of SPH divergence and gradient operators can practically be used for discretization purposes. Nevertheless, some perform better regarding physical and numerical effects. A frequently used form of the balance equations is based on the symmetric divergence operator and antisymmetric gradient: : \\\\frac{d\\\\rho_i}{dt} = -\\\\rho \\\\operatorname{D}_i \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\boldsymbol{v}_j \\\\right\\\\\\\\} : \\\\frac{d\\\\boldsymbol{v}_i}{dt} = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho} \\\\operatorname{\\\\mathbf{G}}_i \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ p_j \\\\right\\\\\\\\} + \\\\boldsymbol{g} Although there are several ways of discretizing the pressure gradient in the Euler equations, the above antisymmetric form is the most acknowledged one. It supports strict conservation of linear and angular momentum. This means that a force that is exerted on particle i by particle j equals the one that is exerted on particle j by particle i including the sign change of the effective direction, thanks to the antisymmetry property abla W_{ij}=- abla W_{ji} . = Variational principle = The above SPH governing equations can be derived from a Least action principle, starting from the Lagrangian of a particle system: : \\\\mathcal{L} = \\\\sum_j m_j \\\\left( \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\boldsymbol{v}_j^2 -e_j +\\\\boldsymbol{g}\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{r}_j \\\\right) , where e_j is the particle specific internal energy. The Euler‚ÄìLagrange equation of variational mechanics reads, for each particle: : \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial\\\\boldsymbol{v}_i} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial\\\\boldsymbol{r}_i}. When applied to the above Lagrangian, it gives the following momentum equation: : \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{v}_i}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\\\sum_j m_j \\\\frac{p_j}{\\\\rho_j^2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\rho_j}{\\\\partial\\\\rho_i} + \\\\boldsymbol{g} , where we used the thermodynamical property \\\\mathrm{d}e = \\\\left(p/\\\\rho^2\\\\right)\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\rho . Pluging the SPH density interpolation and differentiating explicitly \\\\tfrac{\\\\partial\\\\rho_j}{\\\\partial\\\\rho_i} leads to : \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{v}_i}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\\\sum_j m_j \\\\left(\\\\frac{p_i}{\\\\rho_i^2} + \\\\frac{p_j}{\\\\rho_j^2}\\\\right) abla W_{ij}, which is the SPH momentum equation already mentioned, where we recognize the \\\\operatorname{\\\\mathbf{G}} operator. This explains why linear momentum is conserved, and allows conservation of angular momentum and energy to be conserved as well. = Time integration = From the work done in the 80's and 90's on numerical integration of point-like particles in large accelators, appropriate time integrators have been developed with accurate conservation properties on the long term; they are called symplectic integrators. The most popular in the SPH literature is the leapfrog scheme, which reads for each particle i : : \\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol{v}_i^{n+1/2} &= \\\\boldsymbol{v}_i^n + \\\\boldsymbol{a}_i^n \\\\frac{\\\\Delta t}{2}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{r}_i^{n+1} &= \\\\boldsymbol{r}_i^n + \\\\boldsymbol{v}_i^{i+1/2}\\\\Delta t,\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{v}_i^{n+1} &= \\\\boldsymbol{v}_i^{n+1/2} + \\\\boldsymbol{a}_i^{i+1} \\\\frac{\\\\Delta t}{2}, \\\\end{align} where \\\\Delta t is the time step, superscripts stand for time iterations while \\\\boldsymbol{a}_i is the particle acceleration, given by the right-hand side of the momentum equation. Other symplectic integrators exist (see the reference textbook ). It is recommended to use a symplectic (even low-order) scheme instead of a high order non-symplectic scheme, to avoid error accumulation after many iterations. Integration of density has not been studied extensively (see below for more details). Symplectic schemes are conservative but explicit, thus their numerical stability requires stability conditions, analogous to the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition (see below). = Boundary techniques = SPH Convolution support split close to a boundary In case the SPH convolution shall be practised close to a boundary, i.e. closer than , then the integral support is truncated. Indeed, when the convolution is affected by a boundary, the convolution shall be split in 2 integrals, : A(\\\\boldsymbol{r}) = \\\\int_{\\\\Omega(\\\\boldsymbol{r})} A\\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{r^{\\\\prime}}\\\\right) W( \\\\boldsymbol{r}-\\\\boldsymbol{r^{\\\\prime}} ,h) d\\\\boldsymbol{r^{\\\\prime}} + \\\\int_{B(\\\\boldsymbol{r}) - \\\\Omega(\\\\boldsymbol{r})} A\\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{r^{\\\\prime}}\\\\right) W( \\\\boldsymbol{r}-\\\\boldsymbol{r^{\\\\prime}} ,h) d\\\\boldsymbol{r^{\\\\prime}}, where is the compact support ball centered at , with radius , and denotes the part of the compact support inside the computational domain, . Hence, imposing boundary conditions in SPH is completely based on approximating the second integral on the right hand side. The same can be of course applied to the differential operators computation, : abla A(\\\\boldsymbol{r}) = \\\\int_{\\\\Omega(\\\\boldsymbol{r})} A\\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{r^{\\\\prime}}\\\\right) abla W(\\\\boldsymbol{r}-\\\\boldsymbol{r^{\\\\prime}},h) d\\\\boldsymbol{r^{\\\\prime}} + \\\\int_{B(\\\\boldsymbol{r}) - \\\\Omega(\\\\boldsymbol{r})} A\\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{r^{\\\\prime}}\\\\right) abla W(\\\\boldsymbol{r}-\\\\boldsymbol{r^{\\\\prime}},h) d\\\\boldsymbol{r^{\\\\prime}}. Several techniques has been introduced in the past to model boundaries in SPH.  Integral neglect  SPH free-surface model by means of integral neglect The most straightforward boundary model is neglecting the integral, : \\\\int_{B(\\\\boldsymbol{r}) - \\\\Omega(\\\\boldsymbol{r})} A\\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol{r^{\\\\prime}}\\\\right) abla W(\\\\boldsymbol{r}-\\\\boldsymbol{r^{\\\\prime}},h) d\\\\boldsymbol{r^{\\\\prime}} \\\\simeq \\\\boldsymbol{0}, such that just the bulk interactions are taken into account, : abla A_i = \\\\sum_{j \\\\in \\\\Omega_i} V_j A_j abla W_{ij}. This is a popular approach when free-surface is considered in monophase simulations. The main benefit of this boundary condition is its obvious simplicity. However, several consistency issues shall be considered when this boundary technique is applied. That's in fact a heavy limitation on its potential applications.  Fluid Extension  SPH Fluid Extension Boundary technique Probably the most popular methodology, or at least the most traditional one, to impose boundary conditions in SPH, is Fluid Extension technique. Such technique is based on populating the compact support across the boundary with so-called ghost particles, conveniently imposing their field values. Along this line, the integral neglect methodology can be considered as a particular case of fluid extensions, where the field, , vanish outside the computational domain. The main benefit of this methodology is the simplicity, provided that the boundary contribution is computed as part of the bulk interactions. Also, this methodology has been deeply analysed in the literature. On the other hand, deploying ghost particles in the truncated domain is not a trivial task, such that modelling complex boundary shapes becomes cumbersome. The 2 most popular approaches to populate the empty domain with ghost particles are Mirrored- Particles and Fixed-Particles.  Boundary Integral  SPH Boundary Integral model The newest Boundary technique is the Boundary Integral methodology. In this methodology, the empty volume integral is replaced by a surface integral, and a renormalization: : abla A_i = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma_i} \\\\left( \\\\sum_{j \\\\in \\\\Omega_i} V_j A_j abla W_{ij} + \\\\sum_{j \\\\in \\\\partial \\\\Omega_i} S_j A_j \\\\boldsymbol{n}_j W_{ij} \\\\right), : \\\\gamma_i = \\\\sum_{j \\\\in \\\\Omega_i} V_j W_{ij}, with the normal of the generic jth boundary element. The surface term can be also solved considering a semi-analytic expression.  Modelling Physics  = Hydrodynamics =  Weakly compressible approach  Another way to determine the density is based on the SPH smoothing operator itself. Therefore, the density is estimated from the particle distribution utilizing the SPH interpolation. To overcome undesired errors at the free surface through kernel truncation, the density formulation can again be integrated in time. The weakly compressible SPH in fluid dynamics is based on the discretization of the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations or Euler equations for compressible fluids. To close the system, an appropriate equation of state is utilized to link pressure p and density \\\\rho. Generally, the so-called Cole equation (sometimes mistakenly referred to as the \\"Tait equation\\") is used in SPH. It reads : p = \\\\frac{\\\\rho_0c^2}{\\\\gamma}\\\\left(\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\rho}{\\\\rho_0}\\\\right)^{\\\\gamma}-1\\\\right) + p_0 , where \\\\rho_0 is the reference density and c the speed of sound. For water, \\\\gamma = 7 is commonly used. The background pressure p_0 is added to avoid negative pressure values. Real nearly incompressible fluids such as water are characterised by very high speed of sounds of the order 10^3m/s. Hence, pressure information travels fast compared to the actual bulk flow, which leads to very small Mach numbers M. The momentum equation leads to the following relation: : \\\\frac{\\\\delta\\\\rho}{\\\\rho_0}\\\\approx\\\\frac{\\\\boldsymbol{v}}{c^2} = M^2 where \\\\rho is the density change and v the velocity vector. In practice a value of c smaller than the real one is adopted to avoid time steps too small in the time integration scheme. Generally a numerical speed of sound is adopted such that density variation smaller than 1% are allowed. This is the so-called weak- compressibility assumption. This corresponds to a Mach number smaller than 0.1, which implies: : c = 10v_{max} where the maximum velocity v_{max} needs to be estimated, for e.g. by Torricelli's law or an educated guess. Since only small density variations occur, a linear equation of state can be adopted: : p = c^2\\\\left(\\\\rho-\\\\rho_0\\\\right) Usually the weakly-compressible schemes are affected by a high-frequency spurious noise on the pressure and density fields. This phenomenon is caused by the nonlinear interaction of acoustic waves and by fact that the scheme is explicit in time and centred in space . Through the years, several techniques have been proposed to get rid of this problem. They can be classified in three different groups: # the schemes that adopt density filters, # the models that add a diffusive term in the continuity equation, # the schemes that employ Riemann solvers to model the particle interaction. = Density filter technique = The schemes of the first group apply a filter directly on the density field to remove the spurious numerical noise. The most used filters are the MLS (Moving Least Squares) and the Shepard filter which can be applied at each time step or every n time steps. The more frequent is the use of the filtering procedure, the more regular density and pressure fields are obtained. On the other hand, this leads to an increase of the computational costs. In long time simulations, the use of the filtering procedure may lead to the disruption of the hydrostatic pressure component and to an inconsistency between the global volume of fluid and the density field. Further, it does not ensure the enforcement of the dynamic free-surface boundary condition. = Diffusive term technique = A different way to smooth out the density and pressure field is to add a diffusive term inside the continuity equation (group 2) : : {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {d\\\\rho _{i}}{dt}}=\\\\sum _{j}m_{j}\\\\left({\\\\boldsymbol {v}}_{i}-{\\\\boldsymbol {v}}_{j}\\\\right)\\\\cdot abla W_{ij} + \\\\mathcal{D}_i(\\\\rho),} The first schemes that adopted such an approach were described in Ferrari and in Molteni where the diffusive term was modelled as a Laplacian of the density field. A similar approach was also used in . SPH simulation: pressure distribution of a dam-break flow using standard SPH formulation SPH simulation: pressure distribution of a dam-break flow using standard Œ¥-SPH formulation In a correction to the diffusive term of Molteni was proposed to remove some inconsistencies close to the free-surface. In this case the adopted diffusive term is equivalent to a high-order differential operator on the density field . The scheme is called Œ¥-SPH and preserves all the conservations properties of the SPH without diffusion (e.g., linear and angular momenta, total energy, see ) along with a smooth and regular representation of the density and pressure fields. In the third group there are those SPH schemes which employ numerical fluxes obtained through Riemann solvers to model the particle interactions . = Riemann solver technique = SPH simulation: pressure distribution of a dam-break flow using Riemann solver with the low-dissipation limiter. For an SPH method based on Riemann solvers, an inter-particle Riemann problem is constructed along a unit vector \\\\bold{e}_{ij} = - \\\\bold{r}_{ij}/r_{ij} pointing form particle i to particle j . In this Riemann problem the initial left and right states are on particles i and j , respectively. The L and R states are \\\\begin{cases} (\\\\rho_L, U_L, P_L) = (\\\\rho_i, \\\\bold{v}_i \\\\cdot \\\\bold{e}_{ij},P_i) \\\\\\\\\\\\ (\\\\rho_R, U_R, P_R) = (\\\\rho_j, \\\\bold{v}_j \\\\cdot \\\\bold{e}_{ij},P_j) \\\\end{cases} . The solution of the Riemann problem results in three waves emanating from the discontinuity. Two waves, which can be shock or rarefaction wave, traveling with the smallest or largest wave speed. The middle wave is always a contact discontinuity and separates two intermediate states, denoted by (\\\\rho_L^{\\\\ast}, U_L^{\\\\ast},P_L^{\\\\ast}) and (\\\\rho_R^{\\\\ast}, U_R^{\\\\ast},P_R^{\\\\ast}) . By assuming that the intermediate state satisfies U_L^{\\\\ast} = U_R^{\\\\ast} =U^{\\\\ast} and P_L^{\\\\ast} = P_R^{\\\\ast} =P^{\\\\ast} , a linearised Riemann solver for smooth flows or with only moderately strong shocks can be written as \\\\begin{cases} U^{\\\\ast} = \\\\overline{U} + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{(P_L - P_R)}{\\\\bar{\\\\rho} c_0}\\\\\\\\\\\\ P^{\\\\ast} = \\\\overline{P} + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\bar{\\\\rho} c_0 {(U_L - U_R)} \\\\end{cases} , where \\\\overline{U} = (U_L + U_R)/2 and \\\\overline{P} = (P_L + P_R)/2 are inter-particle averages. With the solution of the Riemann problem, i.e. U^{\\\\ast} and P^{\\\\ast} , the discretization of the SPH method is \\\\frac{d \\\\rho_i}{d t} = 2 \\\\rho_i \\\\sum_j \\\\frac{m_j}{\\\\rho_j} (\\\\bold{v}_i - \\\\bold{v}^{\\\\ast})\\\\cdot abla_{i} W_{ij}, \\\\frac{d \\\\bold{v}_i}{d t} = - 2\\\\sum_j m_j \\\\bigg( \\\\frac{ P^{\\\\ast}}{\\\\rho_i \\\\rho_j} \\\\bigg) abla_i W_{ij}. where \\\\bold{v}^{\\\\ast} = U^{\\\\ast} \\\\bold{e}_{ij} + ( \\\\overline{\\\\bold{v}}_{ij} - \\\\overline{U}\\\\bold{e}_{ij} ) . This indicates that the inter-particle average velocity and pressure are simply replaced by the solution of the Riemann problem. By comparing both it can be seen that the intermediate velocity and pressure from the inter- particle averages amount to implicit dissipation, i.e. density regularization and numerical viscosity, respectively. Since the above discretization is very dissipative a straightforward modification is to apply a limiter to decrease the implicit numerical dissipations introduced by limiting the intermediate pressure by P^{\\\\ast} = \\\\overline{P} + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\beta \\\\overline{\\\\rho} {(U_L - U_R)}, where the limiter is defined as \\\\beta = \\\\min\\\\big( \\\\eta \\\\max(U_L - U_R, 0), \\\\overline{c} \\\\big). Note that \\\\beta ensures that there is no dissipation when the fluid is under the action of an expansion wave, i.e. U_L < U_R , and that the parameter \\\\eta , is used to modulate dissipation when the fluid is under the action of a compression wave, i.e. U_L \\\\geq U_R . Numerical experiments found the \\\\eta = 3 is generally effective. Also note that the dissipation introduced by the intermediate velocity is not limited.  Incompressible approach   Viscosity modelling  In general, the description of hydrodynamic flows require a convenient treatment of diffusive processes to model the viscosity in the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations. It needs special consideration because it involves the laplacian differential operator. Since the direct computation does not provide satisfactory results, several approaches to model the diffusion have been proposed. * Artificial viscosity Introduced by Monaghan and Gingold the artificial viscosity was used to deal with high Mach number fluid flows. It reads : \\\\Pi _{ij} = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\displaystyle\\\\frac{-\\\\alpha \\\\bar{c}_{ij} \\\\phi_{ij} + \\\\beta \\\\phi^2_{ij}}{\\\\bar{\\\\rho}_{ij}} & \\\\quad \\\\boldsymbol{v}_{ij} \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{r}_{ij} < 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\quad \\\\boldsymbol{v}_{ij} \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{r}_{ij} \\\\geq 0 \\\\end{cases} Here, \\\\alpha is controlling a volume viscosity while \\\\beta acts similar to the Neumann Richtmeyr artificial viscosity. The \\\\phi_{ij} is defined by : \\\\phi_{ij} = \\\\frac{h\\\\boldsymbol{v}_{ij}\\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{r}_{ij}}{\\\\Vert \\\\boldsymbol{r}_{ij} \\\\Vert^2 + \\\\eta_h^2}. The artificial viscosity also has shown to improve the overall stability of general flow simulations. Therefore, it is applied to inviscid problems in the following form : \\\\Pi_{ij} = \\\\alpha h c \\\\frac{\\\\boldsymbol{v}_{ij} \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{r}_{ij}}{\\\\Vert \\\\boldsymbol{r}_{ij} \\\\Vert^2 +\\\\eta_h^2 }. It is possible to not only stabilize inviscid simulations but also to model the physical viscosity by this approach. To do so : \\\\alpha h c = 2(n+2) \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\rho} is substituted in the equation above, where n is the number of spartial dimensions of the model. This approach introduces the bulk viscosity \\\\zeta = \\\\frac{5}{3} \\\\mu . * Morris For low Reynolds numbers the viscosity model by Morris was proposed. : [ u \\\\Delta \\\\boldsymbol{v}]_{ij} = \\\\frac{2 u}{\\\\rho_j} \\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\boldsymbol{r}_{ij} \\\\cdot abla w_{h,ij}}{\\\\Vert \\\\boldsymbol{r}_{ij} \\\\Vert ^2 +\\\\eta_h^2} \\\\, \\\\boldsymbol{v}_{ij}. * LoShao  Additional physics  * Surface Tension * Heat transfer * Turbulence  Multiphase extensions  = Astrophysics = Often in astrophysics, one wishes to model self-gravity in addition to pure hydrodynamics. The particle-based nature of SPH makes it ideal to combine with a particle-based gravity solver, for instance tree gravity code, particle mesh, or particle-particle particle-mesh. = Solid mechanics and fluid- structure interaction (FSI) =  Total Lagrangian formulation for solid mechanics  To discretize the governing equations of solid dynamics, a correction matrix \\\\mathbb{B}^0 is first introduced to reproducing rigid-body rotation as where abla_a^0 W_{a} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial W\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{r}_{ab}^0, h \\\\right)} {\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{r}_{ab}^0} \\\\mathbf{e}_{ab}^0 stands for the gradient of the kernel function evaluated at the initial reference configuration. Note that subscripts a and b are used to denote solid particles, and smoothing length h is identical to that in the discretization of fluid equations. Using the initial configuration as the reference, the solid density is directly evaluated as where J = \\\\det(\\\\mathbb{F}) is the Jacobian determinant of deformation tensor \\\\mathbb{F} . We can now discretize the momentum equation in the following form {\\\\text{d}t} = 2 \\\\sum_b V_a V_b \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbb{P}}_{ab} abla_a^0 W_{ab} +\\\\mathbf{g} + \\\\mathbf{f}_a^{F:p} + \\\\mathbf{f}_a^{F:v} }} where inter-particle averaged first Piola-Kirchhoff stress \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbb{P}} is defined as _{ab} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\mathbb{P}_a \\\\mathbb{B}_a^0 + \\\\mathbb{P}_b \\\\mathbb{B}_b^0 \\\\right) }}. Also \\\\mathbf{f}_a^{F:p} and \\\\mathbf{f}_a^{F:v} correspond to the fluid pressure and viscous forces acting on the solid particle a , respectively.  Fluid-structure coupling  In fluid-structure coupling, the surrounding solid structure is behaving as a moving boundary for fluid, and the no-slip boundary condition is imposed at the fluid-structure interface. the interaction forces \\\\mathbf{f}_i^{S:p} and \\\\mathbf{f}_i^{S:v} acting on a fluid particle i , due to the presence of the neighboring solid particle a , can be obtained as and \\\\frac{\\\\partial W(\\\\mathbf{r}_{ia}, h )}{\\\\partial {{r}_{ia}}} }}. Here, the imaginary pressure p_a^d and velocity \\\\mathbf{v}_a^d are defined by ) \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{n}^S) (\\\\mathbf{r}_{ia} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{n}^S) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{v}_a^d = 2\\\\mathbf{v}_i - \\\\mathbf{v}_a \\\\end{cases} }}. where \\\\mathbf{n}^S denotes the surface normal direction of the solid structure, and the imaginary particle density \\\\rho_a^d is calculated through the equation of state. Accordingly, the interaction forces \\\\mathbf{f}_a^{F:p} and \\\\mathbf{f}_a^{F:v} acting on a solid particle a are given by and \\\\frac{\\\\partial W(\\\\mathbf{r}_{ia}, h )}{\\\\partial {{r}_{ai}}} }}. The anti- symmetric property of the derivative of the kernel function will ensure the momentum conservation for each pair of interacting particles i and a . = Others = The discrete element method, used for simulating granular materials, is related to SPH.

She is credited with developing the concept for a procedure that would extend the lives of children born with Tetralogy of Fallot (the most common cause of blue baby syndrome). This concept was applied in practice as a procedure known as the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt. The procedure was developed by Alfred Blalock and Vivien Thomas, who were Taussig's colleagues at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Taussig was partially deaf following an ear infection in childhood; in early adulthood this progressed to full deafness. To compensate for her loss of hearing, she learned to use lip- reading techniques and hearing aids to speak with her patients. Taussing also developed a method of using her fingers, rather than a stethoscope, to feel the rhythm of their heartbeats. Some of her innovations have been attributed to her ability to diagnose heart problems by touch rather than by sound. Taussig is also known for her work in banning thalidomide and was widely recognized as a highly-skilled physician. She was the first woman to be elected head of the American Heart Association. She was more proud of the fact that she was the first pediatrician to be elected head of the AMA. In and in 1964 she was awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom. Early life and education Helen Brooke Taussig was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on May 24, 1898, to Frank Wiliam Taussig and Edith Thomas Guild, the youngest of four children. Her father was an economist at Harvard University, and her mother was one of the first students at Radcliffe College, a women's college.

When Taussig was 11 years old, her mother died of tuberculosis. Helen also contracted the disease and was ill for several years, severely affecting her ability to do schoolwork. She also struggled with severe dyslexia through her early school years and was partially deaf. Despite this, she did well at school due to diligent work and extensive tutoring from her father. She graduated from Cambridge School for Girls in 1917, then studied for two years at Radcliffe College before earning a bachelor's degree and Phi Beta Kappa membership from the University of California, Berkeley in 1921. After graduating, Taussig wished to study at Harvard Medical School, but the medical programme did not accept women (this was the case until 1945, though the first woman had applied nearly 100 years earlier, in 1847). The program actually did accept women in theory but would not give them a degree. When Taussig was told this by the dean of the medical school, she asked why anyone would want to attend without any hope of getting a degree, to which the dean replied, \\"That is what we are hoping.\\" Taussig responded, \\"Well, I shall not be the first to disappoint you,\\" and left. grand niece Margo Taussig Pinkerton from first-hand accounts from her great aunt. Instead she considered applying to study public health, partially because her father thought it a more suitable field for women, but learned that as a woman she could attend the programme but would not be recognised with a degree. She later reported asking the dean \\"Who wants to study for four years and get no degree for all that work?\\", and his replying \\"Nobody, I hope.\\" Taussig ended up taking classes at Boston University in histology, bacteriology, and anatomy, without expecting to receive a degree. She had to sit apart from her male colleagues at the back of lecture theatres and was not supposed to speak to them. As an anatomy student at Boston University in 1925, she published her first scientific paper on studies of ox heart muscles with Alexander Begg. With the encouragement of her professor Alexander Begg, Taussig applied to transfer to the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, one of the few medical schools to admit women at the time, and was accepted as a full-degree candidate.Kelly, Evelyn B (December 2000). \\"Helen Brook Taussig\\". Science and Its Times. 6: 1900 to 1949: 387‚Äì388 - via Gale In Context: Global Issues. After completing her MD degree in 1927 at Johns Hopkins, Taussig remained for one year as a cardiology fellow and for two years as a pediatrics intern, and received two Archibald Fellowships, spanning 1927‚Äì1930. Taussig wanted to specialise in Internal Medicine, but there was only one position available for a woman in that field, and it was already taken; she therefore decided to specialise in pediatrics, and ended up working in pediatric cardiology, a field that was still in its infancy. Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt = Concept = Taussig's early career in pediatric cardiology at Johns Hopkins consisted of studying babies with congenital heart defects and rheumatic fever, an inflammation of the heart and other organs resulting from bacterial infection, which was at the time a major source of child mortality. In the early 20th century, rheumatic heart disease made up the majority of clinical cardiology work: congenital heart defects were considered hopeless curiosities as the surgical means to correct them were extremely undeveloped so relatively little could be done to prevent the early deaths of patients with these conditions. She then was hired by the pediatric department of Johns Hopkins, the Harriet Lane Home, as its chief, where she served from 1930 until 1963. Taussig made use of fluoroscopy as a diagnostic tool, and developed a particular interest in infants with cyanosis (blue-tinged appearance), often caused by the heart defect Tetralogy of Fallot. Cyanosis is caused when insufficient oxygenated blood is circulating around the body; in infants it can be known as \\"blue baby syndrome\\". Taussig is most remembered for her role in the development of a surgical treatment for this condition, the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt. A new surgery first performed in 1939 by Robert Gross corrected a common pediatric heart problem: patent ductus arteriosus. The ductus arteriosus is a small blood vessel connecting the pulmonary artery to the aorta of a foetus. Since the foetus obtains oxygen via the mother's placenta and not via its own lungs, which are fluid-filled and not yet functional, this vessel provides a shortcut, bypassing the lungs and allowing more efficient delivery of oxygenated blood around the foetus' body. In most infants, the ductus arteriosus closes within a few weeks of birth so that blood flows to the lungs to be oxygenated; if it remains open or 'patent', the normal flow of blood is disrupted. This new surgical procedure artificially closed the blood vessel. While this was going on, Taussig observed that infants with cyanotic heart defects such as Tetralogy of Fallot or pulmonary atresia often fared remarkably better if they also had a patent ductus arteriosus, with less severe symptoms and longer survival. In general, cyanotic symptoms would often begin or worsen shortly after birth, a change which Taussig suspected was caused by the natural closure of the ductus arteriosus. In cyanotic children, bloodflow from the heart to the lungs via the pulmonary artery is often compromised; Taussig thought that surgically creating an artificial ductus linking these two vessels could increase bloodflow to the lungs and alleviate this problem, increasing survival. She broached the idea to Robert Gross, and he was skeptical, reportedly telling her \\"\\"I have enough trouble closing the ductus arteriosus. I certainly don‚Äôt want to try to make an artificial one.\\" = The first surgeries = Two years later, Taussig obtained the collaboration of Johns Hopkins' new chief of surgery Alfred Blalock and his laboratory assistant Vivien Thomas. The three of them developed a surgery now known as the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt. Originally, it was referred to as the Blalock-Taussig shunt: the critical input of Vivien Thomas was overlooked because of his non-academic role and because of his race. Following extensive experimentation on about 200 dogs, on November 9th, 1944, Blalock and Thomas performed the surgery on the first human patient. Eileen Saxon, a 15-month-old baby, had arrived at the emergency department earlier that month severely underweight at just 5kg, purplish blue in colour and hardly able to drink a sip without gasping for breath. Taussig diagnosed her with Tetralogy of Fallot, a diagnosis which meant that without intervention she certainly would not survive to adulthood. The procedure was an immediate success: Eileen's colour quickly returned to normal, she could drink milk more easily and gained a few kilograms. Two months after the surgery she was discharged from hospital. However, she became cyanotic again a few months later and died shortly before her second birthday. Despite Eileen's death, the operation was proof that the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt could in principle be used to extend the lives of children with cyanotic heart disease. By 1945, this operation had been performed on a total of three infants with pulmonary stenosis and pulmonary atresia. As Alfred Blalock and Helen Taussig wrote in Journal of the American Medical Association, \\"Heretofore there has been no satisfactory treatment for pulmonary stenosis and pulmonary atresia. A ‚Äúblue‚Äù baby with a malformed heart was considered beyond the reach of surgical aid. During the past three months we have operated on 3 children with severe degrees of pulmonary stenosis and each of the patients appears to be greatly benefited. In the second and third cases, in which there was deep persistent cyanosis, the cyanosis has greatly diminished or has disappeared and the general condition of the patients is proportionally improved.\\" Following this report, and lectures given by Blalock and Taussig at conferences around Europe and America, the procedure quickly gained worldwide acceptance. = Legacy = With the international fame this surgery drew, parents worldwide began coming to Baltimore to have their \\"blue babies\\" treated by Blalock and Taussig. The rapid influx of prospective patients was so great that the clinic struggled to cope, and medical visitors from around the world came to assist and to share knowledge. By 1951, the team had operated on over 1,000 children and the surgery had a mortality rate of only 5%. One of the major benefits of this surgery was that children gained the ability to play actively without the rapid exhaustion and frequent loss of consciousness that usually results from cyanotic heart defects. Helen Taussig reportedly kept a letter on her mantelpiece from twelve year old Jean-Pierre Cablan, written after undergoing the procedure: \\"Je suis maintenant un tout autre petit garcon ... je vais pouvoir aller jouer avec mes petits camarades.\\" (\\"I am now a completely new boy... I will be able to play with the other children.\\") Often, an immediate improvement in the level of cyanosis could be seen as well. Taussig later recalled, \\"I suppose nothing would ever give me as much delight as seeing the first patient change from blue to pink in the operating room... bright pink cheeks and bright lips.\\" Nowadays, the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt is useful for prolonging life and improving health in infants before heart defects can be definitively repaired, commonly as the first stage of the three-step Norwood Procedure. It allows infants to survive and gain weight before more complex surgeries are later attempted, and is used in the care of patients with Tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia, and more rare and complex abnormalities. At the time of Taussig's death, tens of thousands of children's lives had been saved by the shunt procedure.  Further career  As a physician, Taussig pioneered the use of x-rays and fluoroscopy simultaneously to examine changes in a baby's heart and lungs in a less invasive manner, and was very skilled in diagnosing heart conditions by feeling the heartbeat with her fingertips, rather than listening with a stethoscope. As well as her day to day clinical work as a paediatrician, Taussig was also an accomplished academic clinician. She published 100 academic articles over her career, considering various aspects of cardiology including biomedical ethics and the evolutionary origins of heart disease. In her research into the long-term outcomes of recipients of the shunt, Taussig remained in touch with many of her patients as they grew to adulthood and middle age. In 1947, after a decade of gathering material, Taussig published her magnum opus, Congenital Malformations of the Heart, considered to be the foundational text of pediatric cardiology as an independent field. The book was expanded into two volumes for a second edition published in 1960. Taussig later became an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine; she was promoted to full professor in 1959. At the time, she was only the second woman to reach full professor status at the university. She continued to serve as the director of the Harriet Lane Home (the children's treatment and research centre at Johns Hopkins) until her retirement in 1963. Most paediatric clinics at the time focussed on rheumatic fever, which was the major source of child mortality, but because of Taussig's experience, the Harriet Lane Home was also able to provide specialist care for children with congenital heart disease. It became a world-leading centre that aspiring surgeons flocked to. Together with the cardiologist Richard Bing, Taussig was in 1949 the first to describe a heart condition now known as Taussig-Bing syndrome. This is the second most common type of double-outlet right ventricle (DORV), a set of rare congenital heart conditions in which the aorta, which is supposed to carry oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle of the heart, instead is connected to the right ventricle and supplies oxygen-poor blood to the body. Several alternative methods for surgically correcting this defect have been tried over the decades since the problem was first described, and survival rates following surgical intervention are greatly improved in recent decades. = Banning of thalidomide = Around 1960, many more babies than usual began to be born in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands with phocomelia, a previously very rare condition in which limbs are absent or small and abnormally formed. The German paediatrician Widukind Lenz was the first to draw a link to the increasing frequency of this condition and thalidomide, a drug which was a popular sleeping medication at the time with the trade name Softenon, and was often taken by pregnant women to counter morning sickness. However, when it is taken between days 35 and 49 of a pregnancy, it blocks normal limb development and causes phocomelia. After hearing about this issue from one of her students in January 1962, Taussig travelled to Germany and examined some of these children for herself. She reached the same conclusion as Lenz: that thalidomide taken during pregnancy was causing phocomelia. She flew back to America and launched a campaign to try to stop the pending approval of thalidomide by the FDA, speaking at the American College of Physicians, writing in journals and magazines, and testifying before Congress in 1967. Her and others' efforts paid off: the drug was banned in the United States and Europe. Retirement and death Taussig formally retired from Johns Hopkins in 1963, but continued to teach, give lectures, and lobby for various causes. In addition, she kept writing scientific papers (of the 129 total that Taussig wrote, 41 were after her retirement from Johns Hopkins). She advocated for the use of animals in medical research and for legalized abortion, as well as the benefits of palliative care and hospice. In 1977, Taussig moved to a retirement community in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. Ever active, she continued making periodic trips to the University of Delaware for research work. At the time of her death, she was researching the genetic basis for congenital heart defects in birds. On May 20, 1986, four days short of her 88th birthday, Taussig was driving a group of friends to vote in a local election when her car collided with another vehicle at an intersection. She died about an hour later at Chester County Hospital, and donated her body to Johns Hopkins.

Among its common names are lotus vine flower, parrot (or parrot's) beak, pelican beak, and coral gem. This plant is widely cultivated but is either extinct in the wild or persists as a few individuals. In 1884 it was already classed as \\"exceedingly rare\\" and plant collection probably hastened its decline. Description Lotus berthelotii with yellow flowers Lotus berthelotii has a creeping or trailing habit, with leaves divided into 3-5 slender leaflets, each leaflet 1‚Äì2 cm long and 1 mm broad, densely covered with fine silvery hairs. The flowers are orange-red to red, peaflower-shaped, but slender, 2‚Äì4 cm long and 5‚Äì8 mm broad. The flowers of Lotus berthelotii and some other Canary Island species appear to be adapted for bird pollination. It was once thought that the original pollinators of these plants (and other genera such as Isoplexis and Canarina) were sunbirds which had become extinct on the Canary Islands, explaining why they are rare and considered endangered species (Vogel 1954; Vogel et al. 1984; Valido et al. 2004). However more recent work has shown that these plants are adequately pollinated by non-specialist flower visiting birds, particularly the Canary Islands chiffchaff (Phylloscopus canariensis), and in fact show some specific adaptations to infrequent pollination by these birds, such as extended flower lifespans.(Ollerton et al. 2008) However, the cultivated population studied by Ollerton et al. (2008) set no fruit, despite the plants receiving large amounts of pollen on their stigmas. This may be because the population was a single, self incompatible clonal genotype; whether this is true of all plants in cultivation is unknown, but may have important implications for the conservation of this species if it is extinct in the wild. Cultivation Lotus berthelotii is cultivated in the horticulture trade and widely available as an ornamental plant with its needle-like silvery foliage and red flowers for: traditional gardens, container (pots), and drought tolerant water conserving gardens. A golden orange flowering cultivar is also grown.

It forms part of the boundary between Ross and Cromarty, to the south, and Sutherland, to the north. The firth is designated as a national scenic area, one of 40 such areas in Scotland. The national scenic area covers 15,782 ha in total, of which 4,240 ha is the marine area of the firth below low tide. A review of the national scenic areas by Scottish Natural Heritage in 2010 commented: Together with Loch Fleet it is a designated as a Special Protection Area (SPA) for wildlife conservation purposes. Additionally, together with Morrich More, it has the designation of Special Area of Conservation (SAC). The total SPA hosts significant populations of the following birds: *Breeding season: osprey (Pandion haliaetus) *Overwintering: bar-tailed godwit (Limosa lapponica), greylag goose (Anser anser), wigeon (Anas penelope), curlew (Numenius arquata), dunlin (Calidris alpina alpina), oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus), and teal (Anas crecca). The SAC protects a variety of habitats, including salt meadows and coastal dune heathland and grassland. The site is of importance for otters (Lutra lutra) and harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) Crossing the firth Dornoch Firth Bridge (west side, 2006) In 1991, the firth was bridged, the new Dornoch Firth Bridge providing a shorter route on the A9 road between Inverness and Thurso; until then traffic had to go by way of Bonar Bridge at the head of the inlet. There were proposals that the bridge should be constructed so as to allow the Far North railway line to also benefit from the shorter route, with the potential for up to 45 minutes to be saved on the journey between Inverness and Thurso/Wick. However this part of the scheme failed to secure government funding, and so only a road bridge was built. On 16 August 1809 the firth was the scene of the Meikle Ferry disaster when an over-laden ferryboat sank with the loss of 99 lives.

He was the second son of Siemowit III, Duke of Masovia and his first wife Euphemia, daughter of Nicholas II of Opava. Already during his father's lifetime, Siemowit IV received his own district, Rawa Mazowiecka (ca. 1373/74), and as a result of the partition of Masovia between him and his older brother Janusz I after the death of their father on 16 June 1381, Siemowit IV finally obtain the totality of his domains: Rawa, P≈Çock, Sochaczew, Gostynin, P≈Ço≈Ñsk and Wizna.  Role in the Greater Polish Civil War  Siemowit IV was opposed to his older brother Janusz I's attempts to obtain the Polish crown. One year after the acquisition of his own domains, King Louis of Poland and Hungary died (10 September 1382), and with this emerged the opportunity to enact his claim to the crown, supported by the Greater Poland and Kujawy nobility (centered around the powerful Bartosz Wezenborg). However, the late King had made arrangements among the Lesser Poland nobility who guaranteed their support to his eldest daughter and heiress Mary and her husband Sigismund of Luxembourg. Without waiting for a favorable settlement, in January 1383, Siemowit IV marched to Greater Poland at the head of his troops, marked the beginning of the Greater Poland Civil War. Unexpectedly, in Buda the Dowager Queen Elizabeth of Bosnia decided to change the decision of her husband and accepted the reign of her youngest daughter Jadwiga over Poland instead of Mary and Sigismund, who remained rulers of Hungary. This decision caused that several supporters of Siemowit IV to hope that he could marry the young Queen (despite the fact that she was already betrothed to William of Habsburg) and in this way, both factions could reconcile and in addition this union with the old Piast dynasty could further legitimize the Angevin rule. The first step to implement this plan was the formal candidacy of Siemowit IV to the royal crown. To this end, in a meeting of nobles and gentry at Sieradz the Archbishop Bodzanta of Gniezno, one of his leading supporters, proposed Siemowit IV's candidacy to the throne. This proposal quickly gained widespread acceptance, and only thanks to the courageous intervention of the voivode of Krak√≥w John of Tƒôczyn, who advised them to abstain from any decision until the arrival of Jadwiga, the idea was abandoned. The opposition of Lesser Poland to the candidacy of Siemowit IV was probably associated with the fear of the growing role of Greater Poland under an eventual rule of the Masovian Duke. Another argument against this was the emerging idea of the union with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. These events did not discourage Siemowit IV, who was determined to obtain the crown, even by force. Probably with the knowledge and consent of Archbishop Bodzanta, he attempted to abduct Jadwiga and marry her, in a desperate act to win the crown. When the Lesser Poland nobility knew of his intentions, they close the gates of Wawel to Bodzanta's men, among them was hidden Siemowit IV. They also warned Jadwiga, who remained at the court of her mother until was secured to travel. Despite the defeat of his ambitious plans, Siemowit IV continued his efforts to obtain the Polish throne. For this purpose, after burning the property of his political opponents in KsiƒÖ≈º, he went back to Sieradz, where a part of the local nobility proclaimed him King of Poland. This time, however, the congress lacked of real authority, and for this reason, he delayed his expected coronation, trying to conquer the country by force. After a disastrous campaign and a failed siege to Kalisz (Siemowit IV was able to obtain only Kujawy), some of his supporters decided to sign an armistice on 29 September 1383. The ceasefire enabled the Polish to add Hungarian troops to the country's forces under the personal command of Sigismund of Luxembourg. The combined attack of Hungarian-Polish forces caused that Siemowit IV avoided further fighting, especially after his brother Janusz opted for the recognition of Jadwiga as Queen. Division of Masovia (1381‚Äì1426). The defeat of Siemowit IV reduced considerably the number of his supporters. Consequently, and after a final rejection in October 1384 from the powerful Lesser Poland nobility to a marriage with Jadwiga, the Masovian Duke adopted a different tactic: if it was impossible for him obtain the crown, he decided to win all the territory possible. Reconciliation with opponents Siewomit, after adding ≈Åƒôczyca to his territory, decided to undertake peace negotiations with Jadwiga, which ended successfully on 12 December 1385 with the signing of a treaty, under which Siemowit IV returned all the lands taken by him in exchange for the sum of 10,000 silver marks, and most important, he relinquished all his claims to the Polish crown and paid homage to the Queen Jadwiga and her new husband and King, Jogaila, from which he received the Duchy of Belz as dowry of Princess Alexandra of Lithuania, Jogaila's sister, who married Siemowit IV as a gesture of reconciliation between both parties.Grzegorz RƒÖkowski: Przewodnik krajoznawczo-historyczny po Ukrainie Zachodniej: Ziemia lwowska, Oficyna Wydawnicza \\"Rewasz\\", 2007.Paul R.

Siemowit IV's complete resignation of his claim to the Polish crown was his attendance to the ceremonies of baptism, marriage and coronation of Jadwiga and Jogaila in Krak√≥w. After these ceremonies, he renewed his homage to the royal couple. He joined the royal entourage to Vilnius, where he participated in the process of Christianization of Lithuania. Post civil war activity Before the war, as an independent ruler he could effectively maneuver between the Polish, Lithuanians and the Teutonic Order; now, as a vassal was clearly seen as a representative of the Polish Kingdom. In addition, in order to finance his policies he needed money and several times he mortgaged some of his domains to the Teutonic Order, including Wizna (during 1382-1401), P≈Ço≈Ñsk (during 1384-1399) and Zawkrze (during 1384-1399 and 1407-1411). In view of the growing friction between the Polish and Teutonic Order, Siemowit IV tried to obtain the greatest benefit for him and intervened as a mediator. Also, after the outbreak of the war of 1409‚Äì1410 between Poland, Lithuania and the Teutonic Order, the attitude of the Masovian Duke wasn't clear: in one side, he tried to contact King Sigismund of Hungary and by other side, he pressured his warring neighbors to maintain the peace. In view of the failure of his attempts to make a compromise, Siemowit IV finally sent his troops at the Battle of Grunwald, but his participation was only symbolic; in fact, was his son Siemovit V who fielded two banners of his own troops and fought alongside the 'Royal' Poles and Lithuanian troops.His banners had white eagle without a crown on a red filed as their badge according to Banderia apud Grunwald. Andrzej Klein, Nikolas Sekunda, Konrad A. Czernielewski: Banderia Apud Grunwald. ≈Å√≥d≈∫ 2000, p. 58-59. In order to maintain his friendly relations with the Teutonic Order, he provides them with refunds even during the campaign; in exchange, the Order returned Zawkrze to Siemowit IV, despite the fact that under the Peace of Thorn (1411) they aren't obliged to do it. Despite his official subordination to Poland, Siemowit IV tried to pursue an independent foreign policy. This was expressed in his frequent contacts with the Hungarian King Sigismund, who, wishing to drag a Polish vassal to his side gave the Masovian Duke the rich prebends from the Bishopric of Veszpr√©m and other possessions across Hungary. Siemowit IV's relations with Poland, although some temporary frictions caused by his too independent policy (he even minted his own coins) remained friendly, despite the fact that he didn't fulfill his duties as a vassal, and only sent troops to Poland occasionally when he was required to do. Another gesture of friendship with King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II was noted when he used Siemowit IV's daughters into political marriages and the support given to his son Alexander in his Church career. In domestic politics, Siemowit IV continued the economic restructuring which begun under the rule of his father. For this purpose, in addition to the existing statutes he implemented the Kulm law in several of his cities and promoted the colonization of the Masovian nobility to Belz. Ill health and death After 1420 Siemowit IV, due to his progressive blindness, gradually gave participation in the government to his adult sons. In 1425, the dispute about the election of his Chancellor Stanis≈Çaw z Paw≈Çowic as Bishop of P≈Çock forced his sons Siemowit V and Casimir II into a humiliating surrender. Siemowit IV died on 21 January 1426 at Gostynin and was buried in the Ducal crypt at P≈Çock Cathedral. Marriage and Issue In 1387, Siemowit IV married Alexandra (d. 20 April 1434), a Lithuanian princess, daughter of Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, and his second wife, Uliana of Tver..

It normally entails taking a piece of metal, usually scrap, and applying it to a grinding wheel in order to observe the sparks emitted.. These sparks can be compared to a chart or to sparks from a known test sample to determine the classification. Spark testing also can be used to sort ferrous materials, establishing the difference from one another by noting whether the spark is the same or different. Spark testing is used because it is quick, easy, and inexpensive. Moreover, test samples do not have to be prepared in any way, so, often, a piece of scrap is used. The main disadvantage to spark testing is its inability to identify a material positively; if positive identification is required, chemical analysis must be used. The spark comparison method also damages the material being tested, at least slightly. Spark testing most often is used in tool rooms, machine shops, heat treating shops, and foundries. Process A bench grinder is usually used to create the sparks, but sometimes this is not convenient, so a portable grinder is used. In either case, the grinding wheel must have adequate surface velocity, at least 23 m/s (4500 surface feet per minute (sfpm)), but should be between 38 and 58 m/s (7500‚Äì11,500 sfpm). The wheel should be coarse and hard, therefore aluminium oxide or carborundum often are employed. The test area should be in an area where there is no bright light shining directly into the observer's eyes. Moreover, the grinding wheel and surrounding area should be dark so that the sparks can be observed clearly. The test sample is then touched lightly to the grinding wheel to produce the sparks.. The important spark characteristics are color, volume, nature of the spark, and length. Note that the length is dependent on the amount of pressure applied to the grinding wheel, so this can be a poor comparison tool if the pressure is not exactly the same for the samples. Also, the grinding wheel must be dressed frequently to remove metallic build-up. =Compressed air method= Another less common method for creating sparks is heating up the sample to red heat and then applying compressed air to the sample. The compressed air supplies enough oxygen to ignite the sample and give off sparks. This method is more accurate than using a grinder because it will always give off sparks of the same length for the same sample. The compressed air applies in essence the same \\"pressure\\" each time. This makes observations of the spark length a much more reliable characteristic for comparison.. =Automated spark testing= Automated spark testing has been developed to remove the reliance upon operator skill and experience, thereby increasing reliability. The system relies upon spectroscopy, spectrometry, and other methods to \\"observe\\" the spark pattern. It has been found that this system can determine the difference between two materials that give off sparks that are indistinguishable to the human eye. Spark characteristics (A) High-carbon steel (B) Manganese steel (C) Tungsten steel (D) Molybdenum steel (A) Wrought iron (B) Mild steel (C) Steel with 0.5 to 0.85% carbon (D) High-carbon tool steel (E) High-speed steel (F) Manganese steel (G) Mushet steel (H) Special magnet steel ;Wrought iron: Wrought iron sparks flow out in straight lines. The tails of the sparks widen out near the end, similar to a leaf.. ;Mild steel: Mild steel sparks are similar to wrought iron's, except they will have tiny forks and their lengths will vary more. The sparks will be white in color. ;Medium-carbon steel: This steel has more forking than mild steel and a wide variety of spark lengths, with more near the grinding wheel. ;High-carbon steel: High-carbon steel has a bushy spark pattern (much forking) that starts at the grinding wheel. The sparks are not as bright as the medium- carbon steel ones. ;Manganese steel: Manganese steel has medium length sparks that fork twice before ending. ;High-speed steel: High-speed steel has a faint red spark that sparks at the tip. ;300-series stainless steel: These sparks are not so dense as the carbon steel sparks, do not fork, and are orange to straw in color. ;310-series stainless steel: These sparks are much shorter and thinner than the 300-series sparks. They are red to orange in color and do not fork. ;400-series stainless steel: 400-series sparks are similar to 300-series sparks, but are slightly longer and have forks at the ends of the sparks. ;Cast iron: Cast iron has very short sparks that begin at the grinding wheel. ;Nickel and cobalt high-temperature alloys: These sparks are thin and very short, they are dark-red in color, and do not fork. ;Cemented carbide: Cemented carbide has sparks under 3 inches, which are dark-red in color and do not fork. ;Titanium: Although titanium is a non-ferrous metal, it gives off a great deal of sparks. These sparks are easily distinguishable from ferrous metals, as they are a very brilliant, blinding, white color. History In 1909,Max Bermann first reported the spark testing method at the 5th International Association for Testing Materials conference, which was held in Copenhagen, as reported by The Engineering Magazine. Based on knowing the conference was held in Copenhagen, the year can be found from: Max Bermann, an engineer in Budapest, was the first to discover that spark testing can be used reliably to classify ferrous material. He originally claimed to be able to distinguish different types of ferrous materials based on percent carbon and principal alloying elements. Moreover, he claimed to achieve an accuracy of 0.01% carbon content... Tschorn . produced an exhaustive treatment of spark testing. His book, Spark Atlas of Steels, along with Spark Testing by Gladwin represent the two most comprehensive texts on the subject . As of the late 1980s, the industrial use of spark testing is not as common as it used to be.. References =Bibliography= *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *.

Early career Davis received his first guitar when he was 11 years old and music became a central part of his life. In 1962, at the age of 14, he and Dave Mounts formed a band called The Apaches, with a Shadows sound. He and Mounts continued to work together in several bands, including the Baracudas and in 1964, formed the Remainders. He joined the Mourners who were looking for a lead guitarist and in 1966, changed their name to Mud. Mud Davis (standing, right) with Mud in 1974He was a founding member of the successful late 1960s and 1970s glam rock band Mud. In addition to playing lead guitar, he wrote a number of the band‚Äôs songs. He wrote the band‚Äôs first single, ‚ÄúFlower Power‚Äù which were released in the October 1967 but did not garner much success. While he didn‚Äôt compose any of the songs on the band‚Äôs first two full albums, he wrote or co- wrote over 45 songs for the band and their subsequent albums. His first and biggest songwriting hit with Mud was ‚ÄúL‚ÄôL‚ÄôLucy‚Äù which reached number 10 on the UK charts in September 1975. It became a bigger hit in both Belgium and the Netherlands, where it reached #1 for 12 and nine weeks, respectively. Davis wrote the B-sides on two of Mud‚Äôs biggest hits, ‚ÄúTiger Feet‚Äù and ‚ÄúDyna-Mite.‚Äù The band broke up in 1977. Other groups Davis worked with several other groups, including The Tremeloes and Darts, but his efforts met with little commercial return. Songwriting Although Davis wrote many of Mud‚Äôs songs, he obtained songwriting success after the band disbanded. Following a chance meeting with Paul Oakenfold, in the late 1980s, he shifted genres from rock to writing club and dance lyrics. He would receive instrumental tracks from producers and incorporate lyrics. He started working with Coco Star, writing ‚ÄúI Need A Miracle‚Äù which was released in 1996 and re-recorded version released in 1997 peaked at #39 in the UK. In 2000, he achieved his biggest commercial songwriting successes. Fragma's \\"Toca's Miracle\\" became Davis‚Äô first #1 hit and was a mashup of Davis-written ‚ÄúI Need a Miracle‚Äù by Coco and Fragma's instrumental ‚ÄúToca Me.‚Äù The song was released on 10 April and won critical acclaim, peaking at #1 in both the UK and Scotland. There have multiple re- releases that have obtained chart success. On August 14, Spiller released \\"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\\" of which he provided important lyrical support. The song reached #1 in five countries including the UK, Australia and New Zealand. It finished #8 on the UK 2000 year-end charts. In their first songwriting session together, Davis and Cathy Dennis wrote \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\" for Kylie Minogue. Released in 2001, it was the first song to have 3,000 radio plays in a single week in the UK, reached #1 in all but one European country and sold over four million copies. Davis and Dennis received an Ivor Novello Award for composing the most performed song of the year. The song was originally intended for Sophie Ellis-Bextor, but she turned it down. Davis soon met Kylie's Artists and Repertoire manager Jamie Nelson who liked it and wanted Kylie to record it. While Kylie wasn't the original artist selected, Dennis believes Kylie was the best artist for the song. The two writers also teamed up to write Brooke Hogan's single, \\"Everything to Me\\", in 2004. The song reached #1 on the Billboard Singles Sales chart. In the Grammy Awards of 2004, Davis shared a Grammy with co-producer Philip Larsen (Manhattan Clique) and performer Minogue, for another Minogue single \\"Come into My World\\", in the category of Best Dance Recording. The song reached #4 in Australian while peaking at #8 in the UK. Davis also work worked with Jan Johnston and with whom he wrote six songs including \\"Am I on Pause?\\". His latest commercial works include co-writing for the song \\"One Foot Boy\\" from Mika's album, The Boy Who Knew Too Much (2009). TV Appearances In December 2005, Davis appeared in the Channel 4 programme, Bring Back...The Christmas Number One. In January 2008, Davis appeared in the BBC Four television documentary, Pop, What Is It Good For?. In December 2009, he appeared in the Channel 4 programme The Greatest Songs of the Noughties, which featured \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\", ranked at No. 9 (in a Top 20). In December 2018, Davis appeared on BBC One's Pointless Celebrities Christmas Special.

Topography Burslem is on the eastern ridge of the Fowlea Valley, the Fowlea being one of the main early tributaries of the River Trent. Burslem embraces the areas of Middleport, Dalehall, Longport, Westport, Trubshaw Cross, and Brownhills. The Trent & Mersey Canal cuts through, to the west and south of the town centre. A little further west, the West Coast Main Line railway and the A500 road run in parallel, forming a distinct boundary between Burslem and the abutting town of Newcastle-under-Lyme. To the south is Grange Park and Festival Park, reclaimed by the Stoke-on-Trent Garden Festival. History Church of St John the Baptist, Burslem The Domesday Book shows Burslem (listed as Bacardeslim) as a small farming hamlet, strategically sited above a ford at Longport, part of the major pack horse track out of the Peak District and Staffordshire Moorlands to the Liverpool/London road. As far back as the late 12th century, a thriving pottery industry existed, based on the fine and abundant local clays. After the Black Death, Burslem emerges in the records as a medieval town ‚Äì St John the Baptist's Church on Cross Hill, with a stone tower dating from 1536, was extended in the 18th century, and is still standing and in use. Until the mid-1760s Burslem was relatively cut off from the rest of England: it had no navigable river nearby, and there were no good and reliable roads. By 1777 the Trent and Mersey Canal was nearing completion, and the roads had markedly improved. The town boomed on the back of fine pottery production and canals, and became known as The Mother Town of the six towns that make up the city. Hill Top Methodist Church and Sunday School opened on Westport Road in 1836. The railway station opened in 1848. The Burslem School of Art was founded in 1853. A new Town Hall was built in the market place in 1854, designed by G T Robinson of Leamington in elaborate baroque style. In 1906, the United Reformed Church was opened on Moorland Road, initially named the Woodall Memorial Congregational Church, in memory of William Woodall MP. In 1910, the town was federated into the county borough of Stoke-on-Trent, and the borough was granted city status in 1925. The new town hall was built in 1911 on Wedgwood Place, in neo-classical style, designed by Russell and Cooper. Many of the novels of Arnold Bennett evoke Victorian Burslem, with its many potteries, mines, and working canal barges. The Burslem of the 1930s to the 1980s is evoked by the paintings and plays of Arthur Berry. Burslem contains Britain's last real working industrial district (i.e. where people live within walking distance of the factories of a single heavy industry, in this case, the potteries) and thus much of the nineteenth-century industrial heritage, buildings and character have survived intact. Disused Bottle ovens of Acme Marls on Bourne's Bank, Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, with St. John's Church, Woodbank Street, in the background whose sandstone tower dates from 1536 (Photographed May 2008) =Trade journals= \\"Burslem, an ancient town, with a market held for a long period by custom, and subsequently sanctioned by an act of parliament, is about three miles from Newcastle and two from Hanley, entitled to the precedence of other towns in this district, as claiming to be the mother, as it is the metropolis, of the Staffordshire Potteries.\\" ‚Äì 1828 journal \\"In the Doomsday Survey ‚Äì for even in that early date Burslem was a place of some importance ‚Äì the town appears, as \\"Burwardeslyn;\\" and frequent mention is made of it in ancient documents during the Middle Ages.\\" ‚Äì 1893 journal Population and housing At the 1991 census count, the population of Burslem was 21,400. A study by consultants Atkins, working from the United Kingdom Census 2001 data, showed that the Burslem population is steady and has not declined despite a manufacturing decline during the 1980s and '90s. Traditional Victorian architecture and Edwardian period terraced houses dominate the town. New housing developments are underway on the Sadlers Factory site and around Woodbank Street. Heavy industrial employment (mines, steel and pots) has left a legacy of ill-health among many older people, but there is the Haywood Hospital (High Lane, Burslem) and the new ¬£300-million University Hospital of North Staffordshire is just three miles away by road. There were two electoral wards covering Burslem at the 2011 Census, Burslem Central and Burslem Park: At the 2011 Census the ethnic demographics of the Burslem Central ward were: White British and White Other ‚Äì 83.5%  Asian/Asian British ‚Äì 9.0%  Mixed/multiple ethnic groups ‚Äì 2.7%  Black/African/Caribbean/Black British ‚Äì 2.3%  Other ethnic group ‚Äì 1.0%  At the 2011 Census the ethnic demographics of the Burslem Park ward were: White British and White Other ‚Äì 90.3%  Asian/Asian British ‚Äì 5.50%  Mixed/multiple ethnic groups ‚Äì 1.92%  Black/African/Caribbean/Black British ‚Äì 1.38%  Other ethnic group ‚Äì 0.8% Economy Industrial scale pottery production has drastically declined since the 1970s; but specialist makers (Steelite) and smaller producers of high-value ceramics (Burleigh, Wade, Moorcroft) are thriving. Burslem is emerging as a centre for small, freelance creative businesses working in sectors such as fine art, animation and crafts as well as pottery. The number of shops in the town centre have markedly declined, hit by the impact of nearby out-of-town retail parks that offer free parking. However, the evening economy is still active with a wide range of bars and restaurants mainly serving English and Indian food. The Leopard Inn is a listed building in Burslem, it is steeped in history and the discovery of tunnels and 58 bedrooms that have been left exactly as they were when they were sealed between the 1930s and 1950s. The Leopard Inn dates from the early 1700s. Initially a coaching house and Inn, there has been a working pub on this site for 300 years or more. In 1878 a three-storey extension including 57 rooms were built. The ambition was to create in Burslem 'The Savoy of the North'. The rooms to the front of the Leopard are today in use as a pub and restaurant, and to the rear the hotel lies abandoned and purportedly haunted. At Spring 2002 unemployment was 4.1% or 1,526 people in the Stoke-on-Trent North constituency; almost the same rate as the West Midlands as a whole. In Burslem at 2001 unemployment was 3.2% and declining. In 2005, the building of business park units in the town. Further business parks are planned for 2006/7 just to the north in Chatterley Valley, and the south in Etruria Valley. In 2019 it was reported that the town's last bank had closed, leaving the town without any free to use Cash Machines, making it the first large town in the UK without one. =Media= In 2007 a social enterprise newspaper, Local Edition, become one of the first newspapers to cover the area regularly. The newspaper covered Burslem, as well as surrounding areas including Tunstall, Middleport and Cobridge, giving a voice to the people in the community. The newspaper ceased publication in 2008 and its archive is online. Tourism The Old Town Hall, Burslem, built in 1854. Architect: G. T. Robinson. Clayhanger Street, Burslem, by the side of the Wedgwood Institute showing the clock tower of Burslem Town Hall in the background, May 2008 Around 5 million tourists visit Stoke-on-Trent each year, supporting around 4,400 direct jobs. Stoke shows its popularity through the number of repeat visits; around 80 percent of visitors have previously been here. Burslem has a variety of strong tourist attractions; Burleigh, Moorcroft, Festival Park, its many pubs, and the Trent & Mersey Canal. The Old Town Hall is one of the largest buildings in Burslem. It also has the legacy of novelist Arnold Bennett, who refers to the town and many of its streets with thinly disguised names: e.g. Burslem/\\"Bursley\\", Swan (Square and Pub)/\\"Duck\\". It is the setting for one of his most famous works, the Clayhanger trilogy. Burslem's centre benefits from having an almost-intact medieval street-plan and countless fine old buildings, and a townscape which almost-totally escaped re-development during the 1960s and 1970s. After being under-used for years, the Burslem School of Art has been refurbished at a cost of ¬£2.1m and offers several large free art galleries. The free Public Library is currently based in the School of Art, after the Venetian Gothic Wedgwood Institute closed for safety reasons early in 2009. Ceramica was a new award-winning ceramics family attraction, based in the imposing old Town Hall and funded by Millennium Lottery money but due to the loss of council funding has been closed. The Queen's Theatre has regular concerts and an annual pantomime. There is a traditional Friday street market, and street carnivals in May and December. Sports The major football club Port Vale F.C. is based in Burslem at Vale Park. The team currently plays in League Two, England's fourth division. Near to the town is Burslem Golf Club, a 9-hole course which once had singer Robbie Williams as a Junior Captain. It was opened on 28 September 1907 by vaudeville entertainer and golfer Sir Harry Lauder. On 29 September 2007 his great-nephew Gregory Lauder-Frost as guest- of-honour rededicated it for another century in a formal ceremony.The Sentinel (Staffordshire) (newspaper), Stoke-on-Trent, 4 October 2007, p. 47 (includes photo). Professional darts player Phil Taylor is from Burslem. Education Burslem is the site of the main campus of Stoke-on-Trent College, the largest Further Education college in England. The campus specialises in media- production and drama. Stoke Studio College, a studio school for 13- to 19-year-olds opened at the college campus in September 2013. Within a six-mile radius from Burslem there are three universities; Staffordshire at Shelton, Keele University, and Manchester Metropolitan's large Art & Design campus at Alsager. The environment The town is elevated and is not prone to flooding. Burslem has a Victorian park designed by Thomas Hayton Mawson, and a large amount of reclaimed green space, such as the Westport Lakes and the later legacy of the 1986 National Garden Festival, which imaginatively reclaimed part of the Shelton Bar steelworks site. The Peak District National Park begins just ten miles north-east of Burslem. Transport The nearby A500 gives access to the M6 motorway. Longport railway station offers direct connections south into Stoke, east to Derby and Nottingham, and north to Crewe and Manchester. The town is straddled by two major off-road cycle paths, part of the National Cycle Network. The Trent and Mersey canal is said to see over 10,000 narrowboats a year using it. The former Burslem Canal was constructed in 1805 and remained open until 1961 when it was breached. The Burslem Canal was a branch of the Trent and Mersey Canal running from the junction near to Newport Lane (opposite the old steel works) though to Furlong Lane area of Middleport. The nearest international airports are Manchester and Birmingham; each is about 60 minutes away by train. Burslem railway station which was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway opened on 1 November 1873. Notable people Burslem's most famous sons include the potter Josiah Wedgwood, the watercolour painter James Holland (1800‚Äì1870), Ian \\"Lemmy\\" Kilmister, the founder, bassist and lead singer of Mot√∂rhead, and Robbie Williams, who was a major shareholder in Port Vale and whose family are still resident in the area. Darts legend and 16-time world champion Phil Taylor was born, raised and also worked in the town. In the 17th century, Molly Leigh was resident of the town, she was accused of being a witch before her death in 1748. Painter James Astbury Hammersley also came from Burslem. William Frederick Horry owned the George Hotel in the 1860s before murdering his wife Jane at his father's house in Boston, Lincolnshire. Despite pleas for clemency he was hanged at Lincoln Castle on 1 April 1872 and his body interred with other executed felons in the interior of the Castle's Lucy Tower, where it can still be seen. William Clowes, one of the founders of Primitive Methodism, was born in Burslem as was John Bennett the potter. Sarah Benett (1850‚Äì1924), the Suffragette, member of the WSPU and social reformer lived in Burslem from 1894. In popular culture George Formby's first sound film, Boots! Boots!, got its world premiere in Burslem in 1934. The film adaptation of Arnold Bennett's The Card was partly filmed on location in the town. Robbie Williams included the song \\"Burslem Normals\\"' on his album Rudebox, released in 2006. A short film, Goodbye to the Normals was also made. A song \\"Waterloo Road\\" performed by Jason Crest was written (by Mike Deighan and Mike Wilsh) about the Waterloo Road in Burslem. The song became very popular and even reached no. 1 in France when the French singer Joe Dassin covered it under the title \\"Les Champs √âlys√©es\\". The guitarist Slash, lead guitarist of Guns N' Roses, was also an inhabitant of Stoke-on-Trent in his early years. Ian Fraser Kilmister, known as Lemmy, was an English musician, singer and songwriter who founded and fronted the rock band Mot√∂rhead.

At the end of the last ice age Loch Fleet became a was a wide-open bay with a tidal delta reaching inland as far as Rogart. The current gradually dragged shingle across the entrance of the bay, producing a tidal basin linked to the sea by a narrow tidal channel. Flora and fauna The mudflats are an important habitat for many bird species, and over 100 species have been recorded at the reserve, with the highest numbers seen during the spring and autumn migrations. Species that spend the winter at the loch include bar-tailed godwit, greylag goose, wigeon, curlew, dunlin, and teal. Approximately 2 % of the entire UK population of greylag geese use the wider Dornoch Firth and Loch Fleet SPA, with Loch Fleet being particularly important during the autumn: as winter progresses many of the geese move on to the Dornoch Firth. The geese spend summers further north, with some heading for Iceland and some remaining within Scotland at sites in Caithness and Sutherland.The Story of Loch Fleet National Nature Reserve. p. 12-13. Breeding birds at Loch Fleet include Arctic terns, common terns, oystercatchers, ringed plovers, wheatears, stonechats, cuckoos, meadow pipits and skylarks, these species tending to favour the links habitat. The pinewoods hold species including crossbills, siskin, redstart, treecreeper, great spotted woodpecker, buzzard and sparrowhawk. Loch Fleet is a good place to see osprey fishing, and in the early 1990s there were 10 breeding pairs of breeding on the wider SPA.The Story of Loch Fleet National Nature Reserve. p. 12-13. The most visible mammals at Loch Fleet are seals: common seals can be seen from the public road at Skelbo year round, and grey seals visit during the winter months. Otter and pipistrelle bats are also found here, along with other typical Scottish land mammals such as roe deer, fox, pine marten, and weasel. Red squirrels and Scottish wildcats have been recorded in the area, but have not been seen in recent years. 265 different species of vascular plants, over 110 species of lichen, and over 50 species of fungi have been recorded at the Loch Fleet NNR. The most noteworthy flora is that of the pinewood at Balblair Wood, where the nationally important species one-flowered wintergreen, twinflower and creeping lady's-tresses can be found. Other species typically found in native pine forests but otherwise uncommon in Scotland such as common wintergreen and lesser twayblade are also found here.The Story of Loch Fleet National Nature Reserve. p.p. 14-15. The alder woods around the mouth of the river at the Mound are also significant. History The ruins of Skelbo Castle are situated on the south side of the loch. The Battle of Littleferry was fought a few days before the Battle of Culloden in 1746. The Sutherland militia came down from the hills above Golspie and fell upon around 500 men led by the Earl of Cromarty. Cromarty's men were cornered in the Littleferry peninsula on the northeast side of the loch, and were either killed, captured, or drowned in the loch. The building of the Mound causeway, designed by Thomas Telford and built between 1814 and 1818 to carry what is now the A9 road, reduced the size of the loch. The causeway, which is nearly 1 km long, acts as a tidal barrier, stopping the sea some 2.5 km short of the former tidal limit. Sluices in the causeway allow salmon and sea-trout to continue to migrate upstream to spawning areas, as well providing an outflow for the River Fleet.The Story of Loch Fleet National Nature Reserve. p. 7. Conservation designations Loch Fleet became a nature reserve under the management of the Scottish Wildlife Trust in 1970 by agreement with the landowners, Sutherland and Cambusmore Estates. In 1975 it was declared a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI): the Loch Fleet SSSI is slightly larger than the NNR, at 1232 ha, and also covers Coul Links. On 24 March 1997, the Dornoch Firth and Loch Fleet Special Protection Area (SPA) was established for wildlife conservation. The SPA covers of Loch Fleet, the Dornoch Firth, Morrich More, the Mound Alderwoods and Tarbat Ness, and was also listed as a RAMSAR Site the same year. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee described it as \\"one of the best examples in northwest Europe of a large complex estuary which has been relatively unaffected by industrial development\\".The Story of Loch Fleet National Nature Reserve. p. 18. Loch Fleet was made a national nature reserve (NNR) in 1998: the NNR is classified as a Category IV protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Together with Oton ≈Ωupanƒçiƒç, Dragotin Kette, and Josip Murn, he is considered as the beginner of modernism in Slovene literature. He is regarded as the greatest writer in the Slovene language, and has sometimes been compared to Franz Kafka and James Joyce. Biography Cankar's birthplace in Vrhnika Ivan Cankar was born in the Carniolan town of Vrhnika near Ljubljana. He was one of the many children of a poor artisan who emigrated to Bosnia shortly after Ivan's birth. He was raised by his mother, Ne≈æa Cankar n√©e Pivk, with whom he established a close, but ambivalent relationship. The figure of a self-sacrificing and submissively repressive mother would later become one of the most recognizable features of Cankar's prose. After finishing grammar school in his hometown, he studied at the Technical High School (Realka) in Ljubljana (1888-1896). During this period, he started writing literature, mostly poetry, under the influence of Romantic and post-Romantic poets such as France Pre≈°eren, Heinrich Heine, Simon Jenko and Simon Gregorƒçiƒç. In 1893, he discovered the epic poetry of Anton A≈°kerc, which had a huge influence on the development of his style and ideals. Under A≈°kerc's influence, Cankar rejected the sentimental post- Romantic poetry and embraced literary realism and national liberalism. In 1896, he enrolled at the University of Vienna, where he studied engineering, but later switched to Slavic philology. In Vienna, he soon started to lead a bohemian lifestyle. He came under the influence of contemporary European literature, especially decadentism, symbolism and naturalism. He became friends with Fran Govekar, a young Slovene writer and intellectual living in Vienna, who introduced him to positivism and naturalism. Between 1897 and 1899, Cankar's core ideas were essentially positivistic. In the spring of 1897 he moved back to Vrhnika. After his mother's death in autumn of the same year, he moved to Pula and in 1898 back to Vienna, where he lived until 1909. During his second stay in Vienna, Cankar's worldview underwent a deep change. In a famous letter to the Slovene feminist author Zofka Kveder in 1900 he rejected positivism and naturalism.Janko Kos, Pregled slovenske knji≈æevnosti, 235 He embraced spiritualism, symbolism and idealism, and later publicly broke with Fran Govekar. At the same time, he became highly critical of Slovene liberalism, published a devastating criticism of Anton A≈°kerc's poetry and gradually moved towards socialism. He was strongly influenced by the Slovene Roman Catholic priest and thinker Janez Evangelist Krek, who advocated radical social activism on a Christian basis. He nevertheless continued to oppose the clericalism and conservativism of Austrian Christian socialists in general and Krek's Slovene People's Party in particular. He joined the Yugoslav Social Democratic Party, an Austro-Marxist party active in the Slovene Lands and in Istria. In the first general elections to the Austrian Parliament in 1907, he ran as a candidate for the party in the largely working-class electoral district of Zagorje-Litija in Carniola, but lost to a candidate of the Slovene People's Party. Ivan Cankar as a martyr: caricature by Hinko Smrekar, 1913 In 1909, he left Vienna and moved to Sarajevo in Bosnia and Hercegovina, where his brother Karlo worked as a priest. During his stay in Sarajevo, he gradually turned away from his previous militant anti-clericalism, becoming more receptive to Christian spirituality. The same year, he settled in the Ro≈ænik district of Ljubljana. Although he remained an active member of the Yugoslav Social Democratic Party, he rejected the party's view on Yugoslav nation-building: in a resolution in 1909, the party favoured a gradual unification of Slovene culture and language with the Serbo-Croatian ones in order to create a common Yugoslav cultural nation. Cankar, on the other hand, strongly defended the national and linguistic individuality of Slovenes. Together with Mihajlo Rostohar, he became the most vocal defender of Slovene individuality within a South Slavic political framework. Already after his electoral defeat in 1907, Cankar had started to publish numerous essays explaining his political and aesthetic views and opinions. After his return to Carniola in 1909, he began travelling throughout the Slovene Lands, delivering lectures and conferences. The most famous of these lectures were \\"The Slovene people and the Slovene culture\\" (Slovensko ljudstvo in slovenska kultura), delivered in Trieste in 1907, and \\"Slovenes and Yugoslavs\\" (Slovenci in Jugoslovani), delivered in Ljubljana in 1913. In the latter, Cankar expressed a favourable opinion on the political unification of all South Slavs, but rejected a cultural merger of South Slavic peoples. Because of the lecture, he was sentenced to one week in prison for defamation of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, he was again imprisoned in Ljubljana Castle for supposed pro-Serbian attitudes, but was soon released. In 1917, he was drafted in the Austro-Hungarian Army, but was demobilized due to poor health. In his last lecture, delivered in the National Club of Trieste just after the end of the War, he called for a moral purification and rejuvenation of Slovene politics and culture. He moved from Ro≈ænik to the center of Ljubljana, where he died in December 1918, from pneumonia, a complication of the Spanish flu pandemic which was raging at the time.[Historical Dictionary of Slovenia (Third edition - 2018) by Leopoldina Plut-Pregelj, Gregor Kranjc, ≈Ωarko Lazareviƒá, Carole Rogel] Page 67 His funeral was attended by a huge crowd and highest representatives from the cultural and political life in Slovenia. In 1936, his grave was moved to the ≈Ωale cemetery in Ljubljana, where he was buried next to his youth friends and fellow authors Dragotin Kette and Josip Murn. Work Pohuj≈°anje v dolini ≈†entflorjanski (Scandal in St. Florian Valley, 1908) Ivan Cankar wrote around 30 books and is considered one of the primary exponents of Slovene modernist literature, alongside Oton ≈Ωupanƒçiƒç, Dragotin Kette and Josip Murn. Cankar is also considered one of Europe's most important fin de si√®cle. He dealt with social, national and moral themes. In Slovenia, his best-known works are the play Hlapci (\\"Serfs\\"), the satire Pohuj≈°anje v dolini ≈†entflorijanski (Scandal in St. Florian Valley) and the novel Na klancu (On the Hill). However, his importance for Slovene and European literature probably lies in his symbolist sketches and other short stories, which, in their mixture of symbolism, modernism and even expressionism, convey a high degree of originality. Erotika (Eroticism, 1899) Cankar started as a poet. He published his first poems already as a teenager in the liberal literary magazine Ljubljanski zvon. In Vienna, he frequented a group of young Slovene artists and authors, among whom were Oton ≈Ωupanƒçiƒç, Fran Eller and Fran Govekar, who introduced him to the modernist currents of European literature. In 1899, Cankar published his first collection of poetry under the title Erotika. Decadentist and sensualist influences were evident and the then bishop of Ljubljana Anton Bonaventura Jegliƒç was so scandalized by the book that he bought all the copies and ordered their destruction. Another edition was issued three years later, but by that time Cankar had already abandoned poetry and moved to engaged literature. In 1902, he wrote his first play Za narodov blagor (For the Welfare of the Nation), which was a violent parody of the liberal nationalist elite in the Slovene Lands, especially in Carniola. The same year, he published the short novel Na klancu (On the Hill), in which he described the misery of the small rural proletariat and the poor material and spiritual conditions of the common people. The novel, which still showed strong naturalistic features, combined with allegorical symbolism and an unusual, biblically inspired style, gained him widespread recognition. In the novels Gospa Judit (Madame Judit) and Hi≈°a Marije Pomoƒçnice (The Ward of Mary Help of Christians) and Kri≈æ na gori (Cross on the Mountain), all published in 1904, he turned to spiritualism and idealism, maintaining as central theme the oppressed people and their yearning for a better life. In 1906, he wrote the short novel Martin Kaƒçur with the subtitle \\"The Life Story of an Idealist\\", which is a ruthless analysis and self-analysis of the failure of an abstract idealist. During the general elections of 1907, he published the short story Hlapec Jernej in njegova pravica (The Servant Jernej and His Justice), in which he describes a clash between the individual worker and both the capitalist and traditional society, the laws of which he cannot understand. Following the electoral victory of the Slovene People's Party, he wrote his most influential play, the satire Hlapci (Serfs), in which he satirized the conformism of the former progressive and agnostic public servants who embraced Catholicism after the defeat of the liberal party. Both the liberal and the Catholic conservative parties in the Slovene Lands reacted acrimoniously against the play: its staging was delayed until after Austria-Hungary's dissolution in Autumn 1918. In the play Pohuj≈°anje v dolini ≈†entflorjanski (Scandal in St. Florian Valley), Cankar made fun of the moral rigidness and culturally backward mentality of Carniola's small semi-urban society. Cankar was also famous for his essays, most of which were published between 1907 and 1913, where he showed stylistic mastery and great irony. His last collection of short stories, entitled Podobe iz sanj (Images from Dreams), which were published posthumously in 1920, is a magically realistic and allegorical depiction of the horrors of World War I. It shows a clear move from symbolism to expressionism and it has been regarded as the finest example of Cankar's poetic prose.  Personality and world view Ivan Cankar with some female friends in Ro≈ænik, Ljubljana Cankar was a relatively fragile personality, both emotionally and physically, but showed an unusually strong and persistent intellectual vigour. He was a sharp thinker, who was able of poignant criticism of both his environment and himself. He was also full of paradoxes and loved irony and sarcasm. He was an unusually sentimental and somehow ecstatic nature, intensely sensitive to ethical issues. He was very introspective: his works, which are to a large extent autobiographic, became famous for the ruthless analysis of his own deeds and misdeeds. Cankar was raised as a Roman Catholic. In his high school years, he became a typical liberal freethinker. He rejected the religious dogmas and embraced the rational explanations provided by contemporary natural and social sciences. Between 1898 and 1902, he fell under the influence of the thinkers Ralph Waldo Emerson and Friedrich Nietzsche. In the writings of the Belgian poet Maurice Maeterlinck Cankar found the idea of the existence of a world soul, with which the individual souls are connected and employed it in his own works. Already around 1903, however, he turned to an original, slightly anarchist interpretation of Marxism. His later life was marked by a gradual evolution towards orthodox Christianity, which became evident after 1910 and especially in the last year of his life. Although he never officially rejected his Roman Catholic faith, he was generally considered an agnostic, albeit sympathetic to some elements of traditional Catholic devotion.  Influence  Cankar was an influential author already during his lifetime. His works were widely read and Cankar was the first author in Slovene language who could make a living exclusively from writing. He became even more influential after his death. Due to his insistence on the cultural and national specificity of the Slovene people, Cankar became the referential figure for the young generations of Slovene intellectuals who rejected the centralistic and unitaristic policies of the Serb political elite in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In the early 1920s, a group of young Catholics, mostly of Christian Socialist convictions, took the title of one of Cankar's minor novels, Kri≈æ na gori (Cross on the Mountain), as the name of their journal. The group, known as the \\"Crusaders\\" (), became the focal point in the emergence of the Christian left in Slovenia in the 1920s and 1930s. Cankar's work and his personal world view influenced all three major literary trends in Slovene literature between 1918 and 1945: the expressionism of Catholic authors such as Ivan Pregelj, Stanko Majcen, and France Bevk, the social realism of the liberal left and Marxist authors (particularly Mi≈°ko Kranjec, Pre≈æihov Voranc, Ciril Kosmaƒç, and Mile Klopƒçiƒç) and the avantgardism of Sreƒçko Kosovel. During the same period, Cankar's political ideas influenced the Slovene social-democratic ideologist Etbin Kristan, the Christian Democratic political theorist Andrej Gosar and the democratic thinkers Albin Prepeluh and Dragotin Lonƒçar. Cankar's psychological introspections became a major source of Edvard Kocbek's and Anton Trstenjak's inquiry in the Slovene national character. During the dictatorship of King Alexander (1929‚Äì1934), Cankar's works were removed from the school curriculum, because he was considered a dangerous advocate of Slovene particularism and nationalism. After 1935, his status as one of the greatest Slovene writers was never put under serious question. In 1937, the first integral collection of Cankar's work was published, edited and annotated by his cousin and conservative literary historian and critic Izidor Cankar. After World War II, the publishing house Cankarjeva zalo≈æba (literally, 'Cankar Press') was established, which took care of the edition of his collected works. Cankar was especially influential as a playwright. He is considered the father of modern Slovene theatre and has had a major influence on almost all Slovene playwrights thereafter, starting from the expressionist theatre of the 1920s (Slavko Grum, Stanko Majcen). Between the 1950s and 1970s, most of the modernisators of Slovene theatre, such as Jo≈æe Javor≈°ek, Dominik Smole, Marjan Ro≈æanc, Primo≈æ Kozak, and Bojan ≈†tih, have been influenced by Cankar's plays. The works of many contemporary Slovene playwrights and screenwriters, including Drago Janƒçar, Du≈°an Jovanoviƒá, Tone Partljiƒç and ≈Ωarko Petan, continue to show a clear influence of Cankar's concepts. Many of the prominent Slovene thinkers reflected on Cankar's works, including Du≈°an Pirjevec Ahac, Milan Komar, and Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek. Already during his lifetime, his works were translated into German, Czech, Serbian, Croatian, Finnish and Russian. Later, his work has been translated also into French, English, Italian, Hungarian, Romanian, Polish, Slovak, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Albanian and Turkish. Cankar's influence outside the Slovene-speaking area has been small, although his work did influence some non-Slovene authors, such as the French Henri Bordeaux, who also published an essay on Cankar in the 1920s, the Austrian Josef Friedrich Perkonig and the Italian Fulvio Tomizza. According to the testimony of the literary critic Josip Vidmar, Cankar's novel Hi≈°a Marije Pomoƒçnice was well received by the famous German writer Thomas Mann, who helped to publish a German edition in 1930.  Legacy  To this day, Cankar's prose is regarded as one of the finest examples of Slovene style. His influence as a novelist has faded since the 1960s, but his plays are still among the most popular theatre pieces in Slovene theatres. Numerous streets, squares, public buildings, and institutions have been named after Ivan Cankar. During World War II, two military units of the Slovene Partisans, the Cankar Brigade and the legendary Cankar Battalion, were named after him. Since the 1980s, Slovenia's largest congress centre, Cankar Hall in Ljubljana, has borne his name. Between June 1994 and January 2007, Cankar was portrayed on the 10,000 Slovenian tolar bill.

It was invented by French engineer Constant Martin in 1947 in Versailles. The instrument consists of a keyboard and a separate amplifier and speaker unit. The keyboard usually covered three octaves, and had a number of switches to alter the tone of the sound produced, add vibrato (a defining feature of the instrument), and provide other effects. The Clavioline used a vacuum tube oscillator to produce a buzzy waveform, almost a square wave, which could then be altered using high-pass and low-pass filtering, as well as the vibrato. The amplifier also aided in creating the instrument's signature tones, by deliberately providing a large amount of distortion. Several models of the Clavioline were produced by different companies. Among the more important were the Standard, Reverb, and Concert models by Selmer in France and Gibson in the United States in the 1950s. The six-octave model employing octave transposition was developed by Harald Bode, and under licensed by J√∂rgensen Electronic in Germany. In England, the Jennings Organ Company's first successful product was the Univox, an early self-powered electronic keyboard inspired by the Selmer Clavioline. In Japan, Ace Tone's first prototype, the Canary S-2 (1962), was based on the Clavioline. Recordings The Clavioline has been used on a number of recordings in popular music as well as in film. Along with the Mellotron, it was one of the keyboard instruments favoured by rock and pop musicians during the 1960s before the arrival of the Moog synthesizer. *\\"Little Red Monkey\\" (1953) by Frank Chacksfield‚Äôs Tunesmiths features Jack Jordan on clavioline.

It is currently structured as a family office, but formerly as a hedge fund. The firm was founded in 1969 by George Soros and, in 2010, was reported to be one of the most profitable firms in the hedge fund industry, averaging a 20% annual rate of return over four decades. It is headquartered at 250 West 55th Street in New York. George Soros founded Soros Fund Management in 1969. Overview Soros Fund Management is the primary adviser for the Quantum Group of Funds; a family of funds dealing in international investments. The company invests in public equity and fixed income markets worldwide, as well as foreign exchange, currency, and commodity markets, and private equity and venture capital funds. The company is reported to have large investments in transportation, energy, retail, financial, and other industries. Robert Soros stepped down as deputy chairman and president in June 2017. David Milich assumed most of his duties. In 2017, Dawn Fitzpatrick replaced Ted Burdick as Chief Investment Officer. In the 2016 election cycle, Soros Fund Management donated over $10 million to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign through super PACs. History The company was founded by George Soros and his former business partner Jim Rogers in 1969. Prior to starting the business Soros and Rogers worked together at the investment bank Arnhold and S. Bleichroder. =1992 to 2007= In the week leading up to September 16, 1992 or \\"Black Wednesday,\\" Quantum Funds earned $1.8 billion by shorting British pounds and buying German marks. This transaction earned Soros the title of \\"the Man Who Broke the Bank of England\\". On the other hand, British government policy in the period before the ejection of the pound sterling from the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System had been widely criticised for providing speculators with a one-way bet. In 2000, the Quantum Fund lost its position as the largest hedge fund in the world when its assets under management changed $10 billion to $4 billion in about a year's time. The fund's losses were a result of investments in technology stocks. That year, CEO Duncan Hennes, and the managers of the Quantum Fund, Stanley Druckenmiller, and Quota Fund, Nicholas Roditi, resigned. The restructuring of Soros Fund Management was announced in a shareholder letter that outlined its plan to merge the Quantum Fund with the Quantum Emerging Growth Fund to form the Quantum Endowment Fund. The intention was to transform the Quantum Fund into a \\"lower-risk, less-speculative fund\\" administered by an outside adviser.Soros' Quantum Fund Replaces Top Strategist - After Big Tech Losses, Fund Will Take A Lower-Risk Approach, \\"Investor's Business Daily\\", May 1, 2000. =2008 to 2011= The firm acquired a stake in Lehman Brothers just prior to its failure in 2008. In 2009, Soros Fund Management partnered with six other hedge funds to acquire IndyMac Bank at a cost of $13.9 billion, thereby gaining control of an estimated $160 billion in bank loans, investments and deposits. In 2010, the company was reported to have created $32 billion in profits since 1973, making it one of the top profit making hedge funds in the industry. In 2011, the firm was reported to have $27.9 billion in assets under management and was ranked sixth on Institutional Investor's Hedge Fund 100 list. That same year, the company partnered with Silver Lake Partners and created fund called Silver Lake Kraftwerk whose focus was investing in natural resource and energy companies. In July 2011, the fund announced plans to return just under $1 billion to investors by the end of 2011 to avoid reporting requirements under the Dodd-Frank reform act and to focus on family investments. That month, the company's chief investment officer Keith Anderson, co-founder of BlackRock left the firm. =2012 to 2019= In September 2016 Soros Fund Management advised a private investment fund tied to Quantum Strategic Partners, which injected the bulk of $305 million into SolarCity, producer of solar panels. The flow of cash allowed Elon Musk, chairman of Tesla Motors and SolarCity, to purchase SolarCity and merge it with Tesla. In June 2018, the firm was reported to own 15% of Justify, the horse that won the 2018 Preakness Stakes, Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes, through the international breeding and racing operation of SF Bloodstock and SF Racing Group. According to The Wall Street Journal, Soros Fund Management gained 8.9% in 2017 and 0.9% in 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, the fund has gained 1.9%. In May 2019 it was announced that Soros Fund Management had built up a 3% stake in Swiss asset manager GAM. In June of 2019 Soros Fund Management led an investment in Vice Media for $250 million. In August 2019, Soros Fund Management increased its stake In Manolete Partners Plc To 11.67%. As of August, 2019, Soros Fund Management's largest holdings were Liberty Broadband, Vici Properties, and Caesar's Entertainment.

History = Ancient times = Numerous archeological discoveries prove that life in the region flourished as early as the Bronze Age, around the 10th century BC, Cugir being part of the territory known as \\"The Iron Gates of Transylvania\\", a region famous for its natural iron resources. In 88‚Äì44 BC, king Burebista, the most powerful of the kings of Thrace, according to the historian Acronion, established the new capital in the area, at Sarmizegetusa Regia (located in the »òureanu Mountains west of Cugir). In this period of time the settlement of Cugir (villa Kunentum) was an important center for metal extracting and processing, with famous workshops producing tools, weapons and coins. = Modern period = Cugir has a complex political history with periods under the Principality of Transylvania, the Habsburg Monarchy, the Kingdom of Hungary and the Kingdom of Romania. In the mid-18th century the Habsburg Empire authorities established the \\"Frontier Police\\" in Transylvania. They also tried to recruit Romanians from the southern Transylvania between Baraolt and OrƒÉ»ôtie but the locals put up a fierce resistance against the enrollment. The population revolted due to a policy of forced removal and deportation used to convince the peoples to join in and a bloody massacre took place in the place known today as the old market of the town. Severe clashes occurred again in the area when the authorities decided to \\"brake\\" the neighboring villages »òibot and Vinerea to establish the 4th company. Finally, after severe conflicts and pressure, in 1764, 6 regiments were established and in 1768 another battalion was formed so that the frontier police in Transylvania was of approx. 17000 soldiers. Town centre After the loss of Silesia, the authorities and the Austrian business began investing funds into the mining and manufacturing industry in Transylvania. In 1764 Empress Maria Theresa of Austria gave long-term loans without interest to concessionaires that pledged to exploit the mines and the state and concessionaire manufactories used free workers brought from Styria, Carinthia, Tyrol, Upper Hungary or Dalmatia, but the local peasants represented the main work force. Due to industrialisation, a great number of Romanian villages and their grounds, pastures, agricultural land and forest were seized. At the end of the 18th century factories for metal processing were founded in Cugir and Sibi»ôel, just 15 years after the suppression of the Revolt of Horea, Clo»ôca and Cri»ôan to exploit the mineral resources and also to bolster obedience towards the Empire. According to documents, the \\"Iron and Steel factory\\" was established in Cugir in the year 1799, one of the first factories in Transylvania and since then the history of the town has revolved around it. After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, it became part of the Kingdom of Hungary within Austria-Hungary up until the end of World War I. From that time, it has been part of Romania, which was acknowledged internationally by the Treaty of Trianon in 1920. Thereafter the factory became owned by the Romanian state and during World War II its production was seized by Nazi Germany for war purposes. Since 1946 the Cugir Arms Factory oriented its production towards military components and house appliances, especially washing machines. It became the top Romanian producer of sewing machines for industrial and private purposes. Economy Entrance to Cugir The town is a heavy industrialised one, with at least half of the total working age population engaged in industrial activities, and around 30 percent engaged in lumbering activities. The S.C. Uzinele Mecanice Cugir S.A. is the main employer in town and it has diversified its production to include along the traditional products automotive components and firearms, and a large part of its production is destined for export. Another employer is S.C Star Transmission Cugir S.A., a Daimler company that produces gearbox parts. Education The town has a high school (David Prodan National College), one technical school, 3 middle schools and 6 kindergartens. Sport The local football team, Metalurgistul Cugir, plays in the Liga III national division.

Their DNA make up a considerable amount of modern Yamato Japanese DNA today and aspects of Philippine culture such as houses on stilts, fish fermentation in vinegar and rice, and light construction materials, the wearing of loincloths and tattooing among men, are still seen as hallmarks of traditional Japanese culture.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265385338  Settlements  After the establishment of a single state within Japan, official trade records began between Japan and the Philippine islands in the Heian and Muromachi period (8th to 12th centuries CE). In the case of the proto-Okinawan chiefdoms, this was much earlier, and ties in with shared migration patterns of Okinawans and Austronesian areas like the Philippines stretching back to the neolithic period. Notable settlements of the period include Bolinao and Agoo along Lingayen Gulf. The Japanese were trading with Philippine kingdoms well before the Spanish period, mainly in pottery and gold. Historical records show that Japanese traders, especially those from Nagasaki, frequently visited the Philippine shores and bartered Japanese goods for such Filipino products as gold and pearls. In the course of time, shipwrecked Japanese sailors, pirate traders, and immigrants settled in the Philippines and intermarried with the early Filipinos. When the Spaniards reached the island of Luzon in 1571, they found Japanese colonies and settlements in Manila and in some parts of the Cagayan Valley, the Cordillera region, Lingayen, Bataan, and Catanduanes Island. The relatively light complexion of the natives of Bontoc and Banaue is probably a result of the early contacts between the Japanese and other islanders from south of Japan and the natives of the Cordillera.Worcester, Dean C. (1906). \\"The Non-Christian Tribes of Northern Luzon\\". The Philippine Journal of Science. National Science Development Board  Pottery trade  The ancient Philippines had a very rich tradition of pottery as verified by the finds at Ayub Cave in South Cotabato and other parts of the islands. Japanese texts mentioned trading expeditions to the island of Rusun (Luzon) for the highly prized Rusun and Namban jars. Japanese texts were very specific about these jars being made in Luzon. The Tokiko, for example, calls the Rusun and Namban jars, Ru-sun tsukuru or Lu-sung ch'i (in Chinese), which means simply \\"made in Luzon.\\" These Rusun jars, which had rokuru (wheel mark), were said to be more precious than gold because of its ability to act as tea canisters and enhance the fermentation. In the 15th century AD, tea-jars were brought by the sh≈çguns to Uji in Kyoto from the Philippines which was used in the Japanese tea ceremony. Many of the important pottery traditions that spread into the Oceania region had their counterparts in the Philippines including the well-known Lapita culture. This quote from American anthropologist Wilhelm Solheim illustrates the matter: terno gowns (1920)alt= The finds at Ayub Cave in South Cotabato confirmed the great pottery tradition of the Philippines. In terms of quantity and quality, these artifacts have no match in Southeast Asia for such an early time period. One interesting question is whether or not the Philippines ever developed an export industry for pottery. Generally it is known that the Thais had developed quite a flourishing industry, which is sometimes considered unique in Southeast Asia. However, it is well documented that the Philippines was in fact a major destination of pottery buyers from the islands of Japan at least. In the Tokiko it mentions that all Rusun jars had this marking known as the rokuru (wheel mark). Those familiar with Philippine ethnography will know that this spiral is commonly used by many of the Philippine tribes. The following symbols were used to identify which kiln was used to make the jar: identified \\"Imbe\\" jars, meant jars coming from Bizen kiln, and mark three times meant a canister from the same oven. A jar with this mark is said to be made of Namban clay. This marking corresponds to the syllable la in Pampanga; Tagbanua for ka (\\"Chinese Pottery,\\" Field Museum of Natural History-Anth., vol.xii, Jul.1912) Of course, the symbol for la can also be the same as that for lu, and so this might correspond to the symbol said to stand for Lu in Rusun-no kokuji (Luzon national writing). According to the Tokiko, certain types of Rusun jars were distinguished by this character. De Morga mentions that Japanese traders were still coming in large numbers for these jars during his time, and that they were willing to spend great sums for them. Apparently work on these jars continued in the North, possibly among the unconquered Igorots, for De Morga had no knowledge of such current production. Later, the knowledge may have again trickled down to Vigan, where a flourishing industry of Burnay jar manufacture survives to this day. Although the Japanese described very high quality jars coming from the Philippines, not all were of elegant nature. In fact, De Morga had some disdain for some of the jars that the Japanese were buying, so they could have been similar to the well-known balanga and other jars in use today. These jars are generally handed down as heirlooms and are noted for their qualities in enhancing the fermentation process. Possibly one of the Japanese uses for the Rusun jars was fermentation of products like Kombucha and Umeboshi plums. For instance, a Japanese family in rural Japan stated that their family used old Rusun jars for exactly this purpose up to this day. A native Filipina with Chinese, American / European and Japanese settlers in the Philippines, (1900)  Fishing technologies  The Filipinos were skilled in all types of fishing and fisheries. In the south, the basnig, a Viking-like ship, was and is the vessel of choice among the Bisayans for ocean fishing. The salambao is a type of raft that utilizes a large fishing net which is lowered into the water via a type of lever made of two criss-crossed poles. Night fishing was accomplished with the help of candles similar to the copal of Mexico. These candles were made from a particular type of resin. Fish corrals, like the ones still used today, were also employed by the ancient Filipino. However, the area in which the Filipino most astonished Westerners was in their advanced aquaculture: Many have looked to Japan for an explanation for these advanced methods. The roe was transplanted to safe pens for incubation and to guard the small fry from predators. Only when sufficiently mature to fend for themselves were they released back into the wild. These days this method is practiced by fisheries throughout the world. Before the Spanish came, the Filipinos also only used large mesh nets when fishing in rivers, lakes or in the sea. This ecologically sound practice protected the young ensuring future good catches. However, the competition brought by the Spaniards resulted in the use of such small mesh nets that the Spanish themselves eventually had to regulate the nets to prevent the destruction of the fisheries. Other Pre-Spanish Filipino industries included the manufacture of liquors and vinegars like tuba, basi, etc., the production of hides for export to Japan, export of edible bird's nests from Northern Palawan to China, the raising and trade of civet cats, the manufacture of gunpowder, the making of wax for export to China, and the making of cotton stockings for export. Japanese Rickshaw, with Geisha and Coolie in Manila (1898) =Spanish era= The Japanese population in the Philippines has since included descendants of Japanese Catholics and other Japanese Christians who fled from the religious persecution imposed by the Tokugawa shogunate during the Edo period and settled during the colonial period from the 17th century until the 19th century. A statue of daimy≈ç Ukon Takayama, who was exiled to the Philippines in 1614 because he refused to disvow his Christian beliefs, stands a patch of land across the road from the Post Office building in the Paco, Manila. In the 17th century, the Spaniards referred to the Paco Area as the 'Yellow Plaza' because of the more than 3,000 Japanese who resided there.{{https://books.google.com/books?id=8uuYDwAAQBAJ&pg;=PT64&dq;=philippines+kirishitan+japan#v=onepage&q;=philippines%20kirishitan%20japan&f;=false In the 16th and 17th centuries, thousands of Japanese people traders also migrated to the Philippines and assimilated into the local population. pp. 52‚Äì3 Many of the Japanese men intermarried with Filipino women (including those of mixed or unmixed Chinese and Spanish descent), thus forming the new Japanese mestizo community. A sizeable population settled in Manila, Davao, the Visayas and in the 1600s in Dilao, Paco, and Ilocos Norte Province. This hybrid group tend to be re-assimilated either into the Filipino or the Japanese communities, and thus no accurate denominations could be established, though their estimates range from 100,000 to 200,000. Many were killed or expelled after World War II because of their alleged collaboration with the Japanese Imperial Army (mostly as translator). Many Japanese mestizos tended to deny their Japanese heritage and changed their family names in order to avoid discrimination. =American period and the Post-WWII era= During the American colonial era, the number of Japanese laborers working in plantations rose so high that in the 20th century, Davao soon became dubbed as a Ko Nippon Koku (\\"Little Japan\\" in Japanese) with a Japanese school, a Shinto shrine and a diplomatic mission from Japan. Prominent scholars and historian like Lydia Yu-Jose and Macario Tiu wrote extensively on the lively presence of Japanese migrants in pre-war Davao due to its noticeably thriving local economy predicated by a huge concentration of rubber, copra, and hemp plantations. Unsurprisingly so, when World War II broke out, it was reported that there were more than 21,000 Japanese residents in the Philippines with about 18,000 or more in Davao. There is even a popular restaurant called \\"The Japanese Tunnel\\", which includes an actual tunnel built by the Japanese during World War II. Davao in Mindanao had a large population of Japanese immigrants who acted as a fifth column, welcoming the Japanese invaders during World War II. These Japanese were disliked by the Chinese and hated by the Moros. The Moros were judged as \\"fully capable of dealing with Japanese fifth columnists and invaders alike.\\"\\"80 Japanese Troop Ships Are Sighted Off Luzon\\" 1941, p. 7. The Moros were to fight the Japanese invaders when they landed at Davao on Mindanao.AP 1941, p. 1.\\"SITUATION AT DAVAO OBSCURE AS JAPS LAND\\" 1941, p. 2.\\"THE JAPS SWARM AT DAVAO BUT THE SITUATION OBSCURE\\" 1941, p. 3.\\"Six Japanese Bombers In New Raid On Manila\\" 1941, p. 13.THE NEW YORK TIMES 1941, p. 1.\\"Large Force Is Attacking\\" 1941, p. 58.

For fear of discrimination, some fled to the mountains after World War II while many others changed their names in the attempts to assimilate. Many were also killed (c. 10,000 Japanese Mestizos and Japanese) while others were deported as an act of retaliation. Their Japanese identity may take on extremes, some have completely lost their Japanese identity while others have \\"returned\\" to Japan, the homeland of their forebears. There is also a number of contemporary Japanese-mestizos, not associated with the history of the earlier established ones, born either in the Philippines or Japan. These latter are the resultant of unions between Filipinos and recent Japanese immigrants to the Philippines or Japanese and immigrant Filipino workers in Japan. Most Japanese mestizos speak Tagalog and/or other Philippine languages. They may also be known as Japinos, although this term is considered derogatory by many. There are believed to be between 100,000 and 200,000 Japanese- mestizos in the country, but no accurate figure is currently available. Thousands of war-displaced ethnic Japanese still live in the country and are denied recognition as Japanese nationals in order to return to Japan. =Modern times= The recent Japanese Filipinos are descendants of 1980s and 1990s Japanese settlers usually businesspeople, most of whom are men, and (mostly female) locals. Many are children of thousands of overseas Filipino workers, who went to Japan mostly as entertainers. They are in the Philippines also to learn English. As the Filipina mothers return to the Philippines, most take their children along with them. A significant number in the U.S. today are the product of Filipino- and Japanese American intermarriages, mostly in California, Hawaii, or other U.S. states, or other U.S. territories in the Pacific, while others are Filipinos of Japanese ancestry who have migrated to the United States. Several foundations today such as the Federation of Nikkeijin Kai Philippines & Manila Nikkeijin Kai exist throughout the country through the efforts of prosperous Japanese descendants and expatriates to assist Filipinos of Japanese ancestry to travel in Japan to trace their roots and visit relatives, and also charity purposes such as offering Long Term Resident visa and educational scholarships to out of school Japanese Filipino children. Similar organizations exist in the Philippines to commemorate and signify the historical settlement of Japanese Filipinos in the region. The Philippines also has the highest number of Japanese in the country than any other Southeast Asian country. = Japanese citizenship = The Supreme Court of Japan on June 4, 2008, ruled against a law that denied citizenship to children born out of wedlock to Japanese fathers and foreign mothers. It upheld the 2003 and 2005 separate suits (of 10 Japanese-Filipino children for Japanese citizenship), filed by Filipino mothers who proved the fathers of their children were Japanese. It affirmed the Tokyo District Court judgment that \\"the marital status of the parents had no bearing on nationality, and that denying the children citizenship violated constitutional guarantees of equality for all.\\"children GMA NEWS.TV, Japan high court rules in favor of 'Japanese-Filipino' children Mel Nuqui, executive director of the Development Action for Women Network (DAWN), stated that \\"the 30-year migration of Filipino entertainers to Japan produced 100,000 Japanese-Filipino children, but very few children were legally acknowledged by their Japanese fathers. DAWN assists Filipino entertainers and Japanese-Filipinos, by helping Japanese-Filipinos locate their fathers in Japan. In 2007, it called for registration of Japanese-Filipinos, and 1,313 Japanese-Filipinos in the Philippines registered (August to October in 2007). However, only 60 of the 1,313 children had been registered in Japan, and of 2,800 children (born out of wedlock from foreign mothers who reside in Japan), 2,000 had Japanese fathers.abs-cbnnews.com, Thousands of 'Japanese-Filipinos' seen to benefit from Japan high court ruling Education *The Manila Japanese School, a Japanese international school, is located in Bonifacio Global City, Metro Manila. *The Cebu Japanese School is a supplementary program for Japanese children in Mandaue City, Cebu.\\"„Ç¢„Ç∏„Ç¢„ÅÆË£úÁøíÊéàÊ•≠Ê†°‰∏ÄË¶ßÔºàÂπ≥Êàê25Âπ¥4Êúà15Êó•ÁèæÂú®Ôºâ\\" ().

History The paper was founded by John Bell. According to historian Robert Darnton, The Morning Post scandal sheet consisted of paragraph-long news snippets, much of it false. Its original editor, the Reverend Sir Henry Bate Dudley, earned himself nicknames such as \\"Reverend Bruiser\\" or \\"The Fighting Parson\\", and was soon replaced by an even more vitriolic editor, Reverend William Jackson, also known as \\"Dr. Viper\\". Originally a Whig paper, it was purchased by Daniel Stuart in 1795, who made it into a moderate Tory organ. A number of well-known writers contributed, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Charles Lamb, James Mackintosh, Robert Southey, and William Wordsworth. In the seven years of Stuart's proprietorship, the paper's circulation rose from 350 to over 4,000. From 1803 until his death in 1833, the owner and editor of the Post was Nicholas Byrne; his son William Pitt Byrne later held these roles. Later the paper was acquired by a Lancashire papermaker named Crompton. In 1848 he hired Peter Borthwick, a Scot who had been a Conservative MP for Evesham (1835‚Äì1847), as editor. When Peter died in 1852, his son Algernon took over. During the 1850s, the Post was very closely associated with the Palmerston ministry. With the aid of Andrew Montagu, Borthwick purchased the Post in 1876. His son Oliver (1873‚Äì1905) was business manager and editor, but died young, and upon the father's death in 1908 control went to his daughter Lilias Borthwick (1871‚Äì1965), wife of Seymour Henry Bathurst, 7th Earl Bathurst (1864‚Äì1943). In 1881, the paper appointed the first woman war correspondent when it sent Lady Florence Dixie to South Africa to cover the First Boer War. The paper was noted for its attentions to the activities of the powerful and wealthy, its interest in foreign affairs, and in literary and artistic events. It began regular printing of notices of plays, concerts, and operas in the early 20th century, and is said to have been the first daily paper in London to do this. Arthur Hervey (1855‚Äì1922) was the paper's music critic between 1892 and 1908. Beginning in 1900, the Australian politician Alfred Deakin wrote anonymous commentaries on Australian politics for the paper, continuing even when he had become Prime Minister. Maurice Baring was a foreign correspondent for the paper, reporting from Manchuria, Russia and Constantinople between 1904 and 1909. He was war correspondent with Russian forces during the Russo-Japanese War (1904‚Äì1905).Mosley, Charles. (2003). Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage (Vol. 3), p. 3324; Baring, Maurice. (1906). With the Russians in Manchuria, p. vi. Also, Harold Williams started to write from Russia. Howell Arthur Gwynne took over as editor in 1911. The paper invited the ire of the Liberals in 1919 when it organised a collection for a purse of ¬£26,317 to be presented to Reginald Dyer, the general of the Amritsar massacre, for his services to the British Empire on his return to Britain. =Controversial publications= On Reginald Dyer's return to India in 1920 after his role in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar, the Morning Post collected and presented ¬£26,317, a golden sword and the title \\"Defender of the Empire\\" to him, naming him the \\"saviour of the Punjab\\" and \\"the man who saved India\\". The editor of the Morning Post received waves of letters containing contributions. The Morning Post received criticism during the sittings of the Hunter commission investigating the massacre as not being impartial. The paper gained notoriety in 1920 when it ran a series of 17 or 18 articles based on The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, text previously published in Russian by Sergei Nilus as the last chapter, Chapter XII, of Velikoe v malom... (The Great in the Small: The Coming of the Anti-Christ and the Rule of Satan on Earth). It is still widely held that Victor E. Marsden, the paper's Russian desk correspondent, used the copy of this rare book retained by the British Museum to translate this last chapter for the paper. Some have questioned this because the anonymous 1923 publication crediting Marsden as the translator in the pamphlet's preface occurred three years after Marsden's death on October 28, 1920. These articles were subsequently collected and formed the basis of the book The Cause of World Unrest, to which half the paper's staff contributed, mainly George Shanks as well as Nesta H. Webster. However, credit for the compilation was given principally to the paper's editor, Gwynne. The book further denounced international Jewry and cultural and social dissolution among the Christian Nations. =Final years= The Bathursts sold the paper to a consortium headed by the Duke of Northumberland in 1924. In 1937, the Morning Post was sold to the Daily Telegraph, which was owned by William Berry. The Post did not remain a separate title, and it was absorbed into the Telegraph.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 11, 2004. This episode represents a milestone in the history of the series as Snowball II is killed off, which, excluding the death of Homer's mother in season 19's \\"Mona Leaves-a\\", is to date the closest thing to an actual Simpson family member actually being killed off. The primary plot is based on Richard Matheson's short story Steel. Plot Bart is taunted by school bullies Nelson, Jimbo, Dolph and Kearney, because he does not have a 10-speed bike as they do. In order to get Homer to buy him one, Bart has his current bike run over by Dr. Hibbert's Mercedes-Benz G500. Homer buys the 10-speed for Bart, but refuses to pay the small assembly fee and builds it himself. Bart is happy since it looks great and works perfectly at first, but it falls apart when he moons the bullies. Homer, wanting Bart to be proud of him, tries to build a battle robot for the \\"Robot Rumble\\". He fails to construct one, but then decides to build a robot with himself in it; Bart names the robot \\"Chief Knock-a Homer\\". Unaware of Homer's ruse, Bart enters the robot in the Rumble. Meanwhile, Dr. Hibbert's car runs over and kills the Simpsons cat Snowball II shortly after crushing Bart's bike. A devastated Lisa recites a poem tearfully at the funeral, where Snowball II is buried next to Snowball I. Lisa gets a ginger cat, which she names Snowball III, but he drowns in the fish tank. The next cat, Coltrane (Snowball IV), jumps out of a window after hearing Lisa play her saxophone. Because of this the owner of the cat sanctuary refuses to give Lisa any more cats. As Lisa sits outside brooding over the recently deceased cats, the Crazy Cat Lady shows up, screams nonsense and hurls a cat (which has a striking resemblance to Snowball II) at her. At first Lisa tries to drive it away, fearing it will meet the same fate as her other cats, but this cat proves to be more durable, when an oncoming car driven by Gil Gunderson swerves and crashes into a tree (this proves good for Gil because he has insurance). Lisa elects to keep the cat and says \\"You're Snowball V, but to save money on a new dish, we'll call you Snowball II and pretend this whole thing never happened\\". In an instance of meta-humor, Principal Skinner then stops by and asks Lisa \\"That's really a cheat, isn't it?\\" Lisa replies \\"I guess you're right, Principal Tamzarian.\\" Skinner walks away defeatedly, acknowledging the new cat as Snowball II. Homer defeats numerous opponents to make it to the finals, but he is physically injured from the battles with the other robots, and at one point he finds a large piece of jagged metal in his arm. In the final match against Professor Frink's undefeated super-robot, an ED-209 look-a-like, Bart finds Homer in the bot after the grueling first round. Caught, Homer apologizes to Bart, but Bart is impressed because of all the pain Homer went through to win his son's admiration. In the second round, ED-209 squeezes Homer out of the robot, but immediately stops as soon as it sees him. Frink explains that the robot follows Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics and \\"is programmed never to harm humans, only to serve them\\". ED-209 sets out a comfy seat for Homer and pours him a martini. Homer wins and Bart is proud of his dad. Cultural references * The title of the episode includes the phrase \\"(annoyed grunt)\\" which is how Homer's catch-phrase \\"D'oh!\\" is written in episode scripts. Making the episode title read \\"I, D'oh-bot\\" - a play on Isaac Asimov's I, Robot * Robot Rumble evokes the televised robot combat shows of Robot Wars and BattleBots. * Homer's robot, Chief Knock-a Homer, is a reference to the former Atlanta Braves mascot Chief Noc-A-Homa. * The song playing while Bart and Milhouse are cycling is \\"Magic Carpet Ride\\" performed by Steppenwolf. * During one of the Robot Rumble matches, one of the commentators states that one robot is \\"killing him softly with his saw,\\" a reference to the Roberta Flack song. * Dr. Hibbert has a Kool and the Gang air-freshener in his car. * The song playing during the Robot Rumble montage is \\"Watching Scotty Grow\\" performed by Bobby Goldsboro (The same song played in the Season 3 episode \\"Saturdays of Thunder\\" as Homer was helping Bart build a soapbox racer). Homer also sings part of this song when delirious from blood loss and a concussion. * One of the robots advertised for Robot Rumble is the T-800 endoskeleton from the popular Terminator film series. * Professor Frink's robot is named 'Smashius Clay' a.k.a. 'Killhammad Aieee', based on the boxer Muhammad Ali and his former real name Cassius Clay. * Professor Frink's robot is based on the ED-209 from the film RoboCop and its accompanying series. * Lisa's fourth cat, Coltrane, is named after the influential jazz performer John Coltrane. * The robot Circuit Ray Leonard is based on the boxer Sugar Ray Leonard. * The song playing while Homer fights Professor Frink's robot is \\"...In A Bag\\" by Static-X. * While Lisa is preparing food for Snowball III, she sings a song with the same melody as the Hokey Pokey song. Reception DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson was critical of the episode, saying it \\"starts pretty well but droops before too long. The robot theme is too silly, and the cat sequences are too morbid. Some of the battle bots bits amuse, but they're not enough to overcome the episode's general flaws.\\" External links *\\"I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot\\" at The Simpsons.com *\\"I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot\\" at the Internet Movie Database Category:2004 American television episodes Category:The Simpsons (season 15) episodes Category:Television episodes about robots Category:Robot combat ","title":"I, (Annoyed Grunt)-bot"},{"id":"1266240","text":"The intersection algorithm is an agreement algorithm used to select sources for estimating accurate time from a number of noisy time sources. It forms part of the modern Network Time Protocol. It is a modified form of Marzullo's algorithm.Digital Time Service Functional Specification Version T.1.0.5. Digital Equipment Corporation, 1989. While Marzullo's algorithm will return the smallest interval consistent with the largest number of sources, the returned interval does not necessarily include the center point (calculated offset) of all the sources in the intersection. The intersection algorithm returns an interval that includes that returned by Marzullo's algorithm but may be larger since it will include the center points. This larger interval allows using additional statistical data to select a point within the interval, reducing the jitter in repeated execution. Method Given M intervals of the form c ¬± r (which means [c‚àír,c+r]), the algorithm seeks to find an interval with M‚àíf sources. The value f is referred to as the number of falsetickers, those sources which are in error (the actual value is outside the confidence band). The best estimate is that which assumes the least number of falsetickers, f. The results will be considered valid if f < M/2, otherwise the algorithm will return failure instead of an interval. The intersection algorithm begins by creating a table of tuples . For each interval there are three entries: the lower endpoint, the midpoint and the upper endpoint, labelled with types ‚àí1, 0 and +1 respectively.

It was fought between the largely Irish Jacobite army loyal to James II and the forces of William III on 12 July 1691 (old style, equivalent to 22 July new style), near the village of Aughrim, County Galway. The battle was possibly the bloodiest ever fought in the British Isles: 5,000‚Äì7,000 people were killed. The Jacobite defeat at Aughrim meant the effective end of James's cause in Ireland, although the city of Limerick held out until the autumn of 1691.G. A. Hayes McCoy p. 244 The campaign By 1691, the Jacobites had adopted a defensive position.Histoire de l'Irlande ancienne et moderne: tir√©e des monumens les ..., Volume 3 Par Mac-Geoghegan (James, abb√©) pp 743-747 tr. The History of Ireland, Ancient and Modern, Taken From the Most Authentic Records, and Dedicated to the Irish Brigade. by the Abbe Mac-Geoghegan. Tr. From the French by Patrick O'Kelly. In the previous year they had retreated into Connacht behind the easily defensible line of the Shannon, with strongholds at Sligo, Athlone and Limerick guarding the routes into the province and the western ports. William besieged Limerick in late August 1690, but his army suffered heavy casualties and losses to disease: he called off the siege and put his army into winter quarters. Internal divisions, exacerbated by the departure of James for France after defeat at the Boyne, were however increasingly undermining the Jacobite command.Hayton, David (2004) Ruling Ireland, 1685-1742: Politics, Politicians and Parties, Boydell, p.27 The main split was between the \\"Peace Party\\", led by James's viceroy Tyrconnell, which proposed negotiating a settlement with William, and the \\"War Party\\" of army officers grouped around Patrick Sarsfield, who believed the war could still be won outright.Bradshaw, Brendan (2016) And so began the Irish Nation: Nationality, National Consciousness and Nationalism in Pre-modern Ireland, Routledge, p.221 Encouraged by William's failure to take Limerick and looking to break Tyrconnell's influence, Sarsfield's faction decided to appeal directly to Louis XIV of France requesting that Tyrconnell and army commander Berwick be removed from office and that Louis send military aid.Hayton, p.28 The \\"Peace Party\\" obtained an offer of settlement from the Williamites in December, upon which Sarsfield demanded that Berwick have Riverston, Denis Daly and other \\"Peace Party\\" leaders arrested. Berwick complied, although likely with the approval of Tyrconnell, who returned from France to try and preserve his influence by repositioning himself with Sarsfield's faction. Alarmed by the fracturing of the Irish command, James was persuaded to request further military support directly from Louis XIV.Childs, John (2007) The Williamite Wars in Ireland, Bloomsbury, p.279 Louis gave little commitment, but sent general Charles Chalmot de Saint-Ruhe to replace Berwick as commander of the Irish Army, with secret instructions to assess the situation and help Louis make a decision on whether to send further military aid.Childs, John (2007) The Williamite Wars in Ireland, Bloomsbury, p.279 Saint-Ruhe, accompanied by lieutenant-generals de Tess√© and d'Usson, arrived at Limerick on 9 May, bringing sufficient arms, corn and meal to sustain the army until the autumn.Childs, p.295 William's forces in Ireland were by this stage led by his subordinate, Dutch officer Godert de Ginkel. Ginkel was aware of the poor military situation facing William in the Netherlands; seeking a quick end to the war he had obtained William's permission to offer the Jacobites moderate terms of surrender.Childs, p.293 However, by late spring 1691 Ginkel was concerned that a French convoy could land further reinforcements at Galway or Limerick, and began planning to enter the field as quickly as possible.Childs, p.304 During May, both sides began assembling their forces for a summer campaign, the Jacobites at Limerick and the Williamites at Mullingar. Godert de Ginkel, the Williamite commander at Aughrim On 16 June, Ginkel's cavalry reconnoitred from Ballymore towards the Jacobite garrison at Athlone. Saint- Ruhe had been unsure where Ginkel would attempt to cross the Shannon, but by 19 June he realised Athlone was the target and began concentrating his troops west of the town.Childs, p.316 Ginkel breached the Jacobite lines of defence and took Athlone on 30 June after a bloody siege; Saint-Ruhe was unable to relieve the town and fell back to the west. Athlone was seen as a significant victory and likely to provoke the collapse of the Jacobite army. The Lords Justice in Dublin issued a proclamation offering generous terms for Jacobites who surrendered, including a free pardon, restoration of forfeited estates, and the offer of similar or higher rank and pay if they wished to join William's army.Childs, p.331 Unaware of the location of Saint-Ruhe's main army and assuming he was outnumbered, on 10 July Ginkel continued a cautious advance through Ballinasloe down the main Limerick and Galway road.Childs, p.332 Saint-Ruhe's and Tyrconnell's plan had been to fall back on Limerick and force the Williamites into another year of campaigning, but wishing to redeem his errors at Athlone Saint-Ruhe appears to have instead decided to force a decisive battle.Doherty, Richard. \\"The Battle of Aughrim\\", Early Modern History (1500‚Äì1700), Issue 3 (Autumn 1995), Vol. 3 Ginkel found his way blocked by Saint-Ruhe's army at Aughrim on the early morning of 12th of July 1691. Deployments At this point of the campaign both armies were about 20,000 strong. The core of the Jacobite army was formed around James's old Royal Irish Army, which had been reorganised by Tyrconnell from 1686 onwards by dismissing the majority of Protestant officers and men.Hayes-McCoy, \\"The Battle of Aughrim\\", Journal of the Galway Archaeological and Historical Society Vol. 20, No. 1/2 (1942), 4 It had been substantially expanded with newly recruited Irish Catholic regiments, organised in the English military tradition.Hayes-McCoy (1942), 6 While it is not now possible to establish with certainty which Jacobite infantry regiments fought at Aughrim, at least 30, including the Foot Guards, Talbot's, Nugent's, Fitzgerald's, Boffin's, Cormack O'Neill's, Saxby's and Iveagh's, have been identified as probably present.Hayes-McCoy (1942), 15-17 The army also included a substantial force of around 4,000 cavalry and dragoons. The composition of Ginkel's army is better documented than that of the Jacobites: in addition to English regiments, it included a large number of Anglo-Irish Protestants as well as Dutch, Danish and French Huguenot contingents.Hayes-McCoy (1942), 6 Different contemporary sources give different dispositions for Ginkel's forces at Aughrim, but most agree that the right wing was composed of English, Anglo- Irish and Huguenot cavalry, with Danish and French cavalry on the left.Hayes- McCoy, 20 Ginkel positioned the English infantry regiments on the right of his centre, with French, Danish and Dutch foot on their left. According to witnesses of the battle the Jacobite lines at Aughrim occupied a strong defensive position extending over two miles.O'Callaghan (ed.) Macariae Excidium, Dublin: Irish Archaeological Society, p.440 To protect his largely inexperienced infantry, Saint-Ruhe deployed most of it in two divisions under Major-Generals John Hamilton and William Dorrington along the crest of a ridge known as Kilcommadan Hill, their positions protected by small hillside enclosures and hedgerows. The centre was further screened by a large bog, impassable to cavalry, through which the Melehan River flowed. The left flank was also bounded by a \\"a large Red Bogg, almost a mile over\\", through which there was only one causeway, overlooked by the deserted village of Aughrim and a ruined castle: Saint-Ruhe deployed the bulk of his cavalry here under Parker, Luttrell and Purcell, under the overall command of Dominic Sheldon. On the right flank where the Tristaun stream ran through the \\"Pass\\" of Urraghry or Urachree, much the more open and weaker position, Saint-Ruhe placed his best infantry and the cavalry regiments of Abercorn, Tyrconnell and Edmund Prendergast, all under his second-in-command, the chevalier de Tess√©.Doherty, Richard. \\"The Battle of Aughrim\\", Early Modern History (1500‚Äì1700), Issue 3 (Autumn 1995), Vol. 3Hayes-McCoy, 18 According to one participant's account Patrick Sarsfield had quarrelled with Saint-Ruhe and was posted with the cavalry reserve to the left rear, under strict instructions not to move without orders. The battle After heavy mist all morning, Ginkel's forces moved into position by about two o'clock in the afternoon, and both sides cannonaded each other for the next few hours.Hayes-McCoy, 21 Ginkel planned to avoid fully joining battle until the next day; he ordered a probing attack on the Jacobites' weaker right flank led by a captain and sixteen Danish troopers, followed by 200 of Cunningham's Eniskillen dragoons. The Jacobite response demonstrated the strength of their defence, but also meant that the attackers were no longer able to break off the engagement as Ginkel had planned. A conference was held at about 4 pm: Ginkel still favoured withdrawing, but the Williamite infantry general Hugh Mackay argued for an immediate full-scale attack.Hayes-McCoy, 22 Henri de Massue led the right of the Williamite cavalry at Aughrim. A French Protestant, he had entered William's service in 1690, forfeiting his French estates and title (the Marquis de Rouvigny) as a result. Battle was joined in earnest between five and six o'clock. In the centre, the largely English and Scots regiments under Mackay attempted a frontal assault on Dorrington's infantry on Kilcommadan Hill. The attackers had to contend with waist-deep water and a tenacious Irish defence of the reinforced hedgelines. They withdrew with heavy losses: the Jacobites pursued them downhill, capturing colonels Erle and Herbert.Hayes- McCoy, 24 On their left centre, the Williamites advanced across low ground exposed to Jacobite fire and took a great number of casualties. The Williamite assault in this area, led by St John's and Tiffin's regiments and the Huguenot foot, was driven back into the bog by the Irish foot fighting with clubbed (reversed) muskets; many of the attackers were killed or drowned.Hayes-McCoy, 24 In the rout, the pursuing Jacobites managed to spike a battery of Williamite guns. The Jacobite regiments of the Guards and Gordon O'Neill were said to have fought particularly strongly. The musketry was so intense that \\"the ridges seemed to be ablaze\\" according to Andreas Claudianus, a Norwegian fighting with the Danish infantry. The Jacobite right and centre holding firm, Ginkel tried to force a way across the causeway on the Jacobite left, where any attack would have to pass along a narrow lane covered by Walter Burke's regiment from their positions in Aughrim castle.Childs, p.336 Four battalions led by Brigadier Kirke secured positions near the castle, following which Compton's Royal Horse Guards got across the causeway at the third attempt. Dorrington having earlier withdrawn two battalions of infantry from this area to reinforce the Jacobite centre, they were faced only with weak opposition, reaching Aughrim village. While a force of Jacobite cavalry and dragoons under Luttrell had been tasked with covering this flank, their commander had ordered them to fall back, following a route now known locally as \\"Luttrell's Pass\\". He was later alleged to have been in the pay of William, though it seems most probable that Luttrell withdrew as he had little or no infantry support. The cavalry regiments of Henri de Massue, Lanier, Langston and Byerley also crossed the causeway, attacking Dorrington's flank. Most commentators, even those sympathetic to William, judged that the Irish foot had fought exceptionally well, and some accounts including James II's Memoirs claim that Saint-Ruhe was \\"in a transport of joy to see the foot [...] behave themselves so well\\".O'Callaghan (ed.) Macariae Excidium, Dublin: Irish Archaeological Society, p.443 Appearing to believe that the battle could be won, he was heard to shout, \\"they are running, we will chase them back to the gates of Dublin\\", before riding across the battlefield to direct the defence against the Williamite cavalry on his left wing.Hayes-McCoy, 26 However, as he rode over to rally his cavalry, Saint-Ruhe paused briefly to direct the fire of a battery, and was decapitated by a cannonball; his death was said to have occurred around sunset, shortly after eight o'clock.O'Callaghan (ed.) Macariae Excidium, Dublin: Irish Archaeological Society, p.453 Jacobite cavalry officer Patrick Sarsfield. Sarsfield's large reserve of cavalry could have countered the Williamite advance, but he had been ordered not to move without specific orders by the Jacobite commander. After Saint-Ruhe's death the Jacobite left, devoid of a senior commander, collapsed very quickly: the regiment of Horse Guards left the field almost immediately, followed shortly by the cavalry and dragoon regiments of Luttrell, Sheldon and Galmoy.Hayes-McCoy, 27 De Tess√© attempted to head a cavalry counter-attack but was seriously wounded shortly afterwards. The Jacobite left flank was now exposed: Mackay and Tollemache also attacked again in the centre, pushing the Jacobites towards the hilltop. Burke and his regiment, still holding the castle, were forced to surrender. Most of the infantry remained unaware of Saint-Ruhe's death, however, and Hamilton's infantry on the Jacobite right continued to counter-attack, fighting the Huguenot foot to a standstill in an area still known locally as the \\"Bloody Hollow\\".Historic map of the site at Ordnance Survey of Ireland.] At around nine o'clock towards nightfall the Jacobite infantry were finally pushed to the top of Killcommadan hill and broke, fleeing towards a bog in the left rear of their position, while their cavalry retreated towards Loughrea.Hayes-McCoy, 28 Sarsfield and Galmoy briefly tried to organise a rearguard action but as in many battles of the period most of the Jacobite casualties occurred in the pursuit, which was ended only by darkness and the onset of mist and rain. The defeated infantry were cut down in their hundreds by the Williamite cavalry as they tried to get away, many of them having thrown away their weapons in order to run faster. In addition to the rank and file the Jacobite casualties and prisoners included many of its most experienced infantry officers: the dead included brigadiers Barker, O'Neill and O'Connell, and colonels Moore, Talbot, O'Mahony, Nugent, Felix O'Neil, and Ulick Burke, Lord Galway.Haverty (1867) The History of Ireland, J Duffy, p.664 The two major-generals commanding the Jacobite centre, Hamilton and Dorrington, were both taken prisoner, Hamilton dying of wounds shortly afterwards. Though the killing of prisoners to prevent rescue was a common practice at the time, Jacobite soldiers were accused of having \\"cut to pieces\\" colonel Herbert after his capture.O'Callaghan (ed.) Macariae Excidium, Dublin: Irish Archaeological Society, p.457 One contemporary Jacobite source (Leslie) alleged that about 2,000 Jacobites were killed \\"in cold blood\\" with many, including Lord Galway and colonel Charles Moore, killed after being promised quarter.Haverty (1867) The History of Ireland, J Duffy, p.664 An eyewitness with the Williamite army, George Story, wrote that \\"from the top of the Hill where [the Jacobite] Camp had been,\\" the bodies \\"looked like a great Flock of Sheep, scattered up and down the Countrey for almost four Miles round.\\"O'Callaghan (ed.) Macariae Excidium, Dublin: Irish Archaeological Society, p.455 Aftermath Estimates of the two armies' losses vary, but they were extremely heavy overall; it is generally agreed that 5,000‚Äì7,000 men were killed at Aughrim. Aughrim has been described as \\"quite possibly the bloodiest battle ever fought in the British Isles\\",Pittock, M. Poetry and Jacobite Politics in Eighteenth-Century Britain and Ireland, Cambridge UP, p.44 but earlier medieval battles, although poorly recorded, may rival this battle in casualty numbers. At the time, the Williamites claimed to have lost only 600 and to have killed fully 7,000 Jacobites.Doherty, The Williamite War in Ireland, p181 Some recent studies put the Williamite losses as high as 3,000,Wauchope, Patrick Sarsfield and the Williamite War, p232 but they are more generally given as between 1,000‚Äì2,000, with 4,000 Jacobites killed.McCoy, p267 gives the Jacobite losses as 4,000 killed, with 2,000 Williamite troops dead.Padraig Lenihan in Consolidating Conquest, Ireland 1603-1727, p186, gives the losses as, \\"one fifth of the estimated 20,000 strong Irish army and at least 1,200 Allies killed in the opening attacks\\" Another 4,000 Jacobites had deserted, while Ginkel recorded 526 prisoners taken of all ranks.Boyle (1867) The Battle-fields of Ireland, from 1688 to 1691, Robert Coddington, p.321 While Ginkel had given word to Dorrington that the captives would be treated as prisoners of war, general officers were instead taken to the Tower of London as prisoners of state, while the majority of the rank and file were incarcerated on Lambay Island where many died of disease and starvation.Childs (2007) The Williamite Wars in Ireland, A & C Black, p.338 Aughrim was the decisive battle of the conflict: the Jacobites had lost many experienced officers, along with much of the army's equipment and supplies. The remnants of the Jacobite army retreated to the mountains before regrouping under Sarsfield's command at Limerick. Many of their infantry regiments were seriously depleted: on 22 July, Bellew's regiment was listed as having 240 soldiers, having lost all its senior officers and sergeants; Slane's regiment 140 soldiers, and Louth's just 28, although some stragglers arrived later.Murtagh , \\"Louth Regiments in the Irish Jacobite Army\\", Journal of the County Louth Archaeological Society, v. 13, num.1 (1953), 11 The city of Galway surrendered without a fight after the battle, on advantageous terms, while Sarsfield and the Jacobites' main army surrendered shortly afterwards at Limerick after a short siege. Cultural impact Memorial cross on the site of the Battle of Aughrim According to O Ciardha, the battle \\"made a searing impression on the Irish consciousness\\".√ì Ciardha (2002) Ireland and the Jacobite Cause - A Fatal Attachment, p,82 Irish tradition came to refer to the battle as \\"Eachdhroim an √°ir\\" - \\"Aughrim of the slaughter\\" - after a line in a poem by Irish language poet S√©amas Dall Mac Cuarta, the \\"Elegy for Sorley MacDonnell\\". While Ginkel ordered the burial of his own dead, the remaining Jacobites were left unburied, their bones remaining scattered on the battlefield for years afterwards: Mac Cuarta wrote \\"It is at Aughrim of the slaughter where they are to be found, their damp bones lying uncoffined\\". John Dunton in his work Teague Land, an account of his travels in Ireland written seven years after the battle, wrote that: \\"After the battle the English did not tarry to bury any of the dead but their own, and left those of the enemy exposed to the fowls of the air, for the country was then so uninhabited that there were not hands to inter them. Many dogs resorted to this aceldama where for want of other food they fed on man's flesh, and thereby became so dangerous and fierce that a single person could not pass that way without manifest hazard\\". He ends the description with the story of a faithful greyhound belonging to a Jacobite killed in the battle who remained by his master's body defending it until shot by a passing soldier in January of the following year. While Aughrim remained a powerful symbol of disaster for Irish Catholics, it was also the focus of Loyalist (particularly Orange Order) celebrations in Ireland on 12 July up until the early 19th century. Thereafter, it was superseded by the Battle of the Boyne in commemorations on \\"the Twelfth\\" due to the switch to the Gregorian calendar (in which 1 July OS became 11 July NS and 12 July OS became 22 July NS). It has also been suggested that the Boyne became emphasised because the Irish troops could be more easily presented as cowardly than at Aughrim, where they were generally agreed to have fought bravely.Padraig Lenihan, The Battle of the Boyne, p258-259, \\"The 18th-century anniversaries of the Boyne and Aughrim served as the focus of more plebeian commemorations that included bonfires and parading. In this context, the 'twelfth' was the most symbolically important battle commemoration but it referred to Aughrim. Until Britain belatedly adopted the Gregorian Calendar in 1752, 1 July was the anniversary of the Boyne and 12 July the anniversary of Aughrim.\\" \\"Aughrim emphasises the valour and martial qualities of the Jacobites with a view to magnify the military achievement and bravery of the Williamites...This depiction of Jacobites, favourable in many respects, may have been less suitable to Protestant communal rituals in the face of a post-1790s Catholic resurgence.\\" The Loyalist song The Sash mentions Aughrim. The battle was the subject of a 1728 tragic drama by Robert Ashton, The Battle of Aughrim or the Fall of Monsieur St Ruth, which after initial neglect became enormously popular from 1770 onwards into the 19th century. Though the play was intended to celebrate the Williamite victory, and casts Saint-Ruhe firmly in the role of antagonist, it also portrays Sarsfield and his lieutenants as heroic figures and incorporates a \\"lament for Catholic patriotism\\", so that \\"both Catholics and Protestants were attracted to the play for generations\\".Wheatley, \\"Heroic Palimpsest: Robert Ashton's \\"The Battle of Aughrim\\" in Eighteenth-Century Ireland / Iris an d√° chult√∫r, v.11 (1996), 54 In 1804 it was noted of Ashton's play that \\"a more popular Production never appeared in Ireland; it is in the hands of every Peasant who can read English; and [...] is committed to memory and occasionally recited\\".Wheatley (1996), 56 In 1885, artist John Mulvany completed a painting of the battle; it was exhibited in Dublin in 2010.Irish Times 2 Oct. 2010 The Battle of Aughrim was also the subject of a long 1968 poem by Richard Murphy, who noted that he had ancestors fighting on both sides. The Aughrim battlefield site became the subject of controversy in Ireland over plans to build the new M6 motorway through the former battlefield. Historians, environmentalists and members of the Orange Order objected to the plans; the motorway opened in 2009. Aughrim Interpretative Centre The Battle of Aughrim Interpretative Centre, in Aughrim village was opened in 1991.

He played college football for the University of Tennessee, and was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the third round of the 2003 NFL Draft. Witten ranks second in all-time career receptions and receiving yards by an NFL tight end, trailing only Tony Gonzalez. Initially retiring in 2018, he became a color analyst for ESPN's Monday Night Football, Witten announced in February 2019 that he would end his retirement and return to the Cowboys in 2019. Early life Witten has two older brothers, Ryan and Shawn, and was raised in Washington D.C., but attended Elizabethton High School in Elizabethton, Tennessee. Witten's father, a 6'8\\", 300 lb. mailman, became addicted to alcohol and drugs when Witten was 6 and became abusive toward Witten's mother, Kim, and Witten's older brothers. When Witten was 11, he moved to Elizabethton to live with his grandparents. His grandfather, Dave Rider, was the coach of the football team where Witten was a two-way player, playing linebacker and tight end.Cowboys' Jason Witten takes on domestic violence Witten became a three-year starter playing both linebacker and tight end, while helping his team reach the state semi-finals three times. As a senior linebacker, he finished the season with 163 tackles (registering a career school record 450), nine sacks, two interceptions, five forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries, and two blocked kicks. That year, he received several accolades: All-American, All-State (also as a junior), USA Today Player of the Year for Tennessee, East Tennessee Player of the Year, Region Defensive Player of the Year and runner- up for the Mr. Football award. He had 26 receptions and 14 touchdowns on offense. He also played basketball, where he averaged 15 points and 12 rebounds per game. College career In 2000, Witten accepted a scholarship to the University of Tennessee, with the promise from head coach Phillip Fulmer that he would be played at defensive end. Witten began his first year playing special teams and also saw time as a second-string defensive end. After injuries impacted the depth at the tight end position, he was moved to the offensive side midway through the season. Although Witten did not agree with the change and even considered transferring, he eventually came around and was used primarily as a blocker while he learned the position. He also started in his first 2 games. As a freshman, he recorded one reception on the season, which went for 11 yards in a 70‚Äì3 victory over Louisiana‚ÄìMonroe. Witten started three games as a sophomore, catching 28 passes for 293 yards and two touchdowns. He scored his first collegiate touchdown in a 35‚Äì24 victory over Alabama. As a junior, he had a breakout year, setting school records for a tight end in receptions (39) and receiving yards (493) with five touchdowns, including one of the most memorable receptions in school history, a game-winning touchdown in the sixth overtime against the University of Arkansas. He received All-SEC (SEC) and Academic All-SEC honors after leading the conference's tight ends in receptions and receiving yards. Even though he decided to enter the NFL Draft after his junior season and had played the position in only 20 games, Witten left ranked third all-time among the school's tight ends with 68 career receptions and fourth all-time with 797 receiving yards. Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= 2003 season: Rookie year Witten was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the third round (69th overall) of the 2003 NFL Draft. Although the Cowboys had a first-round grade on him, when their turn came in the first and second rounds, they selected cornerback Terrence Newman and Al Johnson based on team needs. Undrafted free agent Tony Romo was another rookie who also arrived in Dallas in 2003 and would go on to become Witten's teammate throughout their careers, as well as his roommate during future team training camps and travel games. Entering the league as a 20-year-old rookie, Witten started only seven of the 15 games he played in. On September 7, he made his NFL debut in a 27‚Äì13 loss to the Atlanta Falcons, where he had one reception for 13 yards. He broke his jaw against the Arizona Cardinals, after being hit by Ronald McKinnon and Ray Thompson, which required surgery to have three plates inserted to help the healing. He only missed one game and continued to play through the injury. Then-head coach Bill Parcells complimented Witten on his toughness. Witten was named to the NFL All-Rookie Team for the 2003 season. Witten finished his rookie year with 35 receptions for 347 yards and a touchdown. 2004 season Witten had a breakout season in 2004, leading the NFC with 87 catches, which was also the 11th most in NFL history by a tight end and a Cowboys team record for the position. On November 15, against the Philadelphia Eagles, he had nine receptions for 133 yards and two touchdowns. He was selected to his first Pro Bowl, becoming a part of the Cowboys franchise's legacy of great tight ends that includes Jim Doran, Lee Folkins, Pettis Norman, Mike Ditka, Billy Joe DuPree, Franklin Clarke, Doug Cosbie and Jay Novacek. 2005 season Witten finished sixth in the NFL among tight ends with 66 receptions and became the first Cowboys tight end to have at least 65 receptions in consecutive seasons.

He registered 64 receptions for 754 yards (11.8-yard avg.) and one touchdown, while being named to his third Pro Bowl. On July 22, Witten signed a six-year, $29 million contract extension through 2012. The deal contained $12 million guaranteed, including a $6 million signing bonus and a $6 million option bonus in the second year. 2007 season Witten had a career year in 2007, breaking his own single- season Cowboys tight end record for receptions with 96 and becoming the first franchise tight end to reach 1,000 receiving yards in a season. He became the third tight end in NFL history with 96 or more catches. On December 9 against the Detroit Lions, Witten's 15 receptions tied an NFL record held by Hall of Famer Kellen Winslow Sr., for most receptions in a game by a tight end in NFL history. In the 14th game of the year, Witten became the first Dallas tight end ever to gain over 1,000 receiving yards in a season. Witten was also one of the NFL-record 13 Cowboys players selected to the Pro Bowl. Additionally, he made the 2007 All-Pro team along with teammates Terrell Owens and DeMarcus Ware. In the Week 9 game on November 4, while playing at Philadelphia, he made a 53-yard reception after losing his helmet. He was named as a First Team All- Pro for the 2007 season. Witten was nominated for the 2007 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award, which was won by Jason Taylor. 2008 season Witten made his 400th NFL reception in the Cowboys' Thanksgiving Day game against the Seattle Seahawks on November 27. On December 28, against the Philadelphia Eagles, he completed a 42-yard pass for the first pass of his NFL career.

There was talk that the seriousness of the injury could keep him out of action for a considerable time. On September 5, Witten battled back and was able to play in the season opener, catching two passes for 10 yards in a victory over the New York Giants. Witten's availability for the game was in question due to the spleen injury he suffered during the preseason, but he was active for the game after being medically cleared to play. During Week 2 against the Seattle Seahawks, Witten caught four passes for 58 yards. He finished the game with 702 career receptions to become just the second player in franchise history to reach 700+ catches (Michael Irvin has 750) and the third tight end in NFL history to do so (Tony Gonzalez and Shannon Sharpe are the other two). Witten became the fastest tight end to reach 700 catches, reaching the milestone in 145 games, Gonzalez took 154 games and Sharpe took 178 games. Witten also became the youngest wide receiver/tight end to reach 700+ catches with 30 years, 133 days. This record was later broken in Week 3 by Cardinals' wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald who totaled 707 career catches with 29 years, 23 days. His 58-yard performance gave him 7,977 receiving yards for his career passing former Cowboy Jackie Smith for fourth all-time in receiving yards among tight ends. After Week 3, Witten passed Ozzie Newsome for third place all-time in receiving yards among tight ends. In week 8, Witten caught a career-high 18 passes for a career-high 167 yards. This is also a record for receptions by a tight end; the previous record of 15 receptions was set by Kellen Winslow in 1984. On November 4, against the Atlanta Falcons, Witten set the Cowboys' all-time receptions record of 754, surpassing Michael Irvin's previous record of 750. On December 23, against the New Orleans Saints, Witten set the NFL single-season record for receptions by a tight end (103), barely breaking the previous record of 102 receptions, which had been set by Tony Gonzalez in 2004. He extended the record to 110 in the season finale. On December 26, Witten was selected to his eighth Pro Bowl.

In that same game, he also became the second tight end in NFL history to reach 900 receptions. Witten had 27 yards against the New York Giants to move his career receiving yards to 10,065 to pass Shannon Sharpe (10,060) for the second-most receiving yards by an NFL tight end. In Week 16, Witten sprained his knee against the Indianapolis Colts but was still able to play in the season finale against the Washington Redskins. That season, the Cowboys emphasized the running game and although his receiving production declined, his blocking was noticed while helping DeMarco Murray lead the NFL in rushing. Witten finished with 60 receptions for 654 yards and five touchdowns. He was named to his tenth career Pro Bowl for his 2014 season. He was ranked 93rd by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015. 2015 season Witten in 2015 On September 20, in the first game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Witten suffered a right knee injury and two sprained ankles but was able to only miss a play and a half.

On December 27, against the Buffalo Bills, he set the Cowboys record with his 118th consecutive game with a reception, passing Michael Irvin.

Allen helped Dallas establish a then team record by allowing just 20 sacks totaling just 93 yards (fewest in the NFL) while earning all-rookie honors. Allen was forced into a starting spot just four games into his rookie season when Mark Tuinei suffered back spasms on the road against the Washington Redskins. He received the game ball for helping keep the Redskins sackless for the game. He recorded his first NFL start at left tackle, replacing an injured Tuinei against the Arizona Cardinals. This marked the first time a rookie offensive lineman had started for Dallas since November 24, 1991 when Erik Williams started at right tackle against the Redskins. Allen returned to a back-up role for the next two weeks, but early in the morning on October 24, Williams was injured in an automobile accident and was out for the rest of the season, after which Allen was moved into the starting line-up at Williams' right tackle position permanently, beginning with a game at Cincinnati on October 30. He received the game ball, along with Tuinei, for helping hold the New Orleans Saints without a sack in a Monday night win in New Orleans on December 19. In that Monday night contest, the 325-lb. Allen shocked the Saints by running down linebacker Darion Conner from behind on an interception return early in the game, when Allen was running from a standing start at the moment of interception. The game's announcers talked more about Allen's amazing feat than the actual interception. In his first playoffs, Allen received the game ball against the Green Bay Packers on January 8, when the Dallas offense recorded 450 total yards and Troy Aikman completed 23-of-30 passes for 337 yards. Allen sprained his left ankle during the game, but he returned to play. In the NFC Championship Game at San Francisco, he struggled playing through three quarters on his injured ankle before leaving the game. In 1995, Allen, while earning his first of seven consecutive trips to the Pro Bowl, was one of a club-record four Dallas offensive linemen named to the Pro Bowl, Ray Donaldson, Nate Newton, and Mark Tuinei being the others, after just one year of experience as a starting guard. The team finished fifth in the league in total offense while Emmitt Smith gained a franchise record 1,773 rushing yards, his fourth NFL rushing title in five years. Smith also scored a then NFL record 25 rushing touchdowns.

Allen returned to the starting lineup following the bye week, against the Chicago Bears on September 28, but was forced to leave in the second quarter without enough strength in his left leg to block effectively. He was once again back in the starting lineup the following week at the Giants. Allen was then forced to move out to left tackle after the loss of Tuinei during a game at Washington on October 13.

Addressed to the Central News Agency of London. Dated 25 September 1888, the letter was postmarked and received by the Central News Agency on 27 September. The letter itself was forwarded to Scotland Yard on 29 September. Although many dispute its authenticity, the \\"Dear Boss\\" letter is regarded as the first piece of correspondence signed by one Jack the Ripper, ultimately resulting in the unidentified killer being known by this name. Content The \\"Dear Boss\\" letter was written in red ink, was two pages long and contains several spelling and punctuation errors. The overall motivation of the author was evidently to mock investigative efforts and to allude to future murders. The letter itself reads: The first page of the \\"Dear Boss\\" letter, dated 25 September 1888 The second page of the \\"Dear Boss\\" letter Media publication Initially, this letter was considered to be just one of many hoax letters purporting to be from the murderer.Jack the Ripper: An Encyclopedia p. 159 However, following the discovery of the body of Catherine Eddowes in Mitre Square on 30 September, investigators noted a section of the auricle and earlobe of her right ear had been severed,Jack the Ripper: An Encyclopedia p. 56 giving credence to the author's promise within the letter to \\"clip the lady's ears off\\". In response, the Metropolitan Police published numerous handbills containing duplicates of both this letter and the Saucy Jacky postcard in the hope that a member of the public would recognise the handwriting of the author. Numerous local and national newspapers also reprinted the text of the \\"Dear Boss\\" letter in whole or in part. These efforts failed to generate any significant leads.Sex, Lies, and Handwriting: A Top Expert Reveals the Secrets Hidden in Your Handwriting p. 25 =Perpetrator pseudonym= Following the publication of the \\"Dear Boss\\" letter and the Saucy Jacky postcard, both forms of correspondence gained worldwide notoriety. These publications were the first occasion in which the name \\"Jack the Ripper\\" had been used to refer to the killer. The term captured the imagination of the public. In the weeks following their publication, hundreds of hoax letters claiming to be from \\"Jack the Ripper\\" were received by police and press alike, most of which copied key phrases from these letters. Authenticity In the years following the Ripper murders, police officials have stated that they believed both the \\"Dear Boss\\" letter and the Saucy Jacky postcard were elaborate hoaxes most likely penned by a local journalist. Initially, these suspicions received little publicity, with the public believing the press articles that the unknown murderer had sent numerous messages taunting the police and threatening further murders. This correspondence became one of the enduring legends of the Ripper case. However, the opinions of modern scholars are divided upon which, if any, of the letters should be considered genuine. However, the \\"Dear Boss\\" letter is one of three named most frequently as potentially having been written by the killer, and a number of authors have tried to advance their theories as to the Ripper's identity by comparing handwriting samples of suspects to the writing within the \\"Dear Boss\\" letter. Like many documents related to the Ripper case, the \\"Dear Boss\\" letter disappeared from the police files shortly after the investigation into the murders had ended.Jack the Ripper: The Definitive Casebook p. 85 The letter may have been kept as a souvenir by one of the investigating officers. In November 1987, the letter was returned anonymously to the Metropolitan Police, whereupon Scotland Yard recalled all documents relating to the Whitechapel Murders from the Public Record Office, now The National Archives, at Kew. =Journalist's confession= In 1931, a journalist named Fred Best is reported to have confessed that he and a colleague at The Star newspaper named Tom BullenThe Dreadful Acts of Jack the Ripper and Other True Tales of Serial Murder p. 4 had written the \\"Dear Boss\\" letter, the Saucy Jacky postcard, and other hoax messages purporting to be from the Whitechapel Murderer‚Äîwhom they together had chosen to name Jack the Ripper‚Äîin order maintain acute public interest in the case and generally maintain high sales of their publication.Joe Nickell, Real or Fake: Studies in Authentication, University Press of Kentucky, Lexington, 2009. pp.44-7. Calligraphy and linguistic analysis In 1993, the handwriting of the \\"Dear Boss\\" letter was compared to that of the purported diary of James Maybrick. The report noted that the \\"characteristics of the Dear Boss letter follow closely upon the Round Hand writing style of the time and exhibit a good writing skill.\\" In 2018, a forensic linguist based at the University of Manchester named Andrea Nini stated his conviction that both the \\"Dear Boss\\" letter and the Saucy Jacky postcard had been written by the same individual. Commenting upon his conclusions, Dr Nini stated: \\"My conclusion is that there is very strong linguistic evidence that these two [pieces of correspondence] were written by the same person. People in the past had already expressed this tentative conclusion, on the basis of similarity of handwriting, but this had not been established with certainty.\\" Notes References Cited works and further reading   * External links * The \\"Dear Boss\\" letter at casebook.org * Jack the Ripper letters: \\"Dear Boss\\" at whitechapeljack.com * \\"Dear Boss\\" letter: How Jack the Ripper got his name at britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk Category:1888 documents Category:Hoaxes in England Category:Jack the Ripper Category:Letters (message) Category:Murder in London ","title":"Dear Boss letter"},{"id":"1266321","text":"Muelle was a trademark signature and design by Juan Carlos Arg√ºello, Spanish graffiti pioneer (circa 1966‚Äì1995). Around 1980, during the Madrilene cultural Movida, Arg√ºello started reproducing the logo he had designed in walls and public spaces of Madrid. It consisted of the word Muelle (Spanish for spring), or an R with an enclosing circle (¬Æ) and a line in the shape of a coiled spring ending in an arrowhead. At first he used an ink marker, and later spraypainted his signature extensively around Madrid (and to a lesser extent, in other Spanish localities). In the eighties, he improved his technique, using several colours, wider borders, and 3-D effects. His innovative style, along with the profusion of his tags made his work popular. Many other Madrilene youths created their own tags inspired by Muelle's, often ending strokes with arrowheads. The spread of hip-hop culture in Spain in the late 1980s introduced the new graffiti styles developed in the United States, but variations in Muelle's work basically kept his original design.

It consists of several palace buildings and monuments dating back to the Qajar and Pahlavi eras. History The complex traces its origin to a garden in the region of Niavaran, which was used as a summer residence by Fath-Ali Shah (1772‚Äì1834) of the Qajar Dynasty. A pavilion was built in the garden by the order of Naser ed Din Shah (1831‚Äì1896) of the same dynasty, which was initially referred to as Niavaran, and was later renamed Saheb Qaranie. The pavilion of Ahmad Shah Qajar (1898‚Äì1930) was built in the late Qajar period. During the reign of the Pahlavi Dynasty, a new palace named Niavaran was built for the imperial family of Mohammad Reza Shah (1919‚Äì1980). The palace was designed in 1958 and completed in 1967. It served a variety of purposes for the imperial court including as a home for the Shah and Empress as well a place to entertain visiting foreign heads of state. The Shah and Empress left basically everything behind when they left Iran in January 1979. All of the peripheral buildings of the Saheb Qaranie, with the exception of the Ahmad Shahi Pavilion, were demolished, and the present-day structures were built to the north of the Saheb Qaranie. The Ahmad Shahi Pavilion was then used as an exhibition centre for presents from world leaders to the Iranian imperial monarchs.Niavaran Cultural Historic Complex: History Private library Private library of the Niavaran Palace Complex is a historical complex remaining from the Qajar and Pahlavi periods. The library was established by Empress Farah and consists of about 23,000 books, mostly in the Persian and French languages, and specialises in books related to philosophy. The library was publicly inaugurated in 1994, on the occasion of International Museum Day. Niavaran Cultural ‚Äì Historical Complex/Private Library, 25 April 2011 =Construction= The interior designing of the library was designed by architect Aziz Farmanfarmayan. It has dissimilar features from the point of view of architecture and constructional structure, and was built based on the contemporary architecture prevailing in the 1970s. The building's design was materialized with a combination of bronze and special glass. About 300 well- lit cylinders supply the needed lighting of the library. The library was fully reorganized after twenty five months of practical and hard attempt. =Features= The building is allocated to libraries in three separate levels; the reading room, the main library, and the audio visual room. In addition, the library includes an underground basement for storing paintings and other artifacts. Other sections of the library include sets of artwork, which number over 350. The works reflect parts of modern art history, particularly the modern tendencies of Iranian art in the 1950s and 1960s. =Gallery= File:Niavaran palace library (15).jpgBooks File:Niavaran palace library (16).jpgThe first floor File:Niavaran palace library (17).jpgBook shelves and glassy cylindrical ceiling File:Niavaran palace library (21).jpgThe first floor File:Niavarn lib IMG 3447.jpgAnother view of inside the library File:Niavaran library IMG 3459.jpgAnother view of inside the library Gallery 2011 Ahmad-Shahi Pavilion Tehran 6214852688 by Kamyar Adl.jpg Ahmad Shahi Pavilion Sahebgharanie.JPGThe Saheb Qaranie 2011 Sahebqraniyeh Palace Tehran 6250140114.jpgThe Imperial office of the Shah within the Saheb Qaranie.

It grows on relatively moist areas with summer rainfalls, however specimens from its eastern and southern distribution live under really wet conditions; it needs full sun and well drained soils. Its temperature needs fluctuate between 19 and 10 ¬∞C on average a year. This tree accepts from subtropical to cool climate. Pinus ayacahuite is a large tree, regularly growing to 30‚Äì45 m and exceptionally up to 50 m tall. It is a member of the white pine group, Pinus subgenus Strobus, and like all members of that group, the leaves ('needles') are in fascicles (bundles) of five, with a deciduous sheath. The needles are finely serrated, and 9‚Äì16 cm long. The cones are long and slender, 15‚Äì40 cm long and 4‚Äì6 cm broad (closed), opening to 6‚Äì10 cm broad; the scales are thin and flexible. The seeds are small, 6‚Äì8 mm long, and have a long slender wing 18‚Äì25 mm long. It is moderately susceptible to white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola), but in cultivation has proved somewhat less susceptible than most other American white pines (see e.g. western white pine, sugar pine). Cultivation and uses It has been planted with ornamental and commercial purposes for paper industry at different latitudes and altitudes in different parts of the world: In Equatorial and tropical regions- Commercial production: On the high elevations of Kenya, Tanzania and Angola. In temperate subtropical regions- Commercial production: It is planted on the highlands of South Africa. On the highest elevations of Southern Brazil. Northern India. In temperate regions at middle and low altitudes: Argentine provinces of Salta, Tucuman and Cordoba; at 500 to 1500 m above sea level. At low elevations near sea level: Commercial production: Australia (Queensland and New South Wales), New Zealand. As ornamental: It has been successfully planted in the British Isles. The largest tree in Germany (height 2013: 20.5 m) is growing in the arboretum Sequoiafarm Kaldenkirchen. Despite its tropical origins (the natural range is entirely south of the Tropic of Cancer), it is surprisingly tolerant of cold, having survived temperatures down to nearly -30 ¬∞C in cultivation in Scotland and Pennsylvania, United States. It is grown as an ornamental tree in parks for its attractive foliage and very long cones, among the longest that can be grown in many temperate areas. The wood is valuable, used for general indoor construction work. Notes References *Dvorak, W. S., G. R. Hodge, E. A. Guti√©rrez, L. F. Osorio, F. S. Malan and T. K. Stanger. 2000. Pinus tecunumanii.

Most of them are, like Supergirl, women with powers similar to those of Superman. The name was trademarked by Detective Comics, Inc.January 1942 to prevent competitors from using it. As was the practice, a publication produced solely for legal purposes was created with the title of Superwoman. The cover was a reproduction of More Fun Comics,Issue #73 with the interior being a reprint of the third issue.Action Comics #3 The first true appearance of Superwoman was in Action Comics.Issue #60 ‚Äî May 1943 Versions =Lois Lane= Lois Lane's first appearance as Superwoman in Action Comics #60 (1943). Art by Joe Shuster. The first appearance of \\"Superwoman\\" in a DC comic is a story in Action Comics #60\\"Lois Lane -- Superwoman\\", Action Comics #60 May 1943 by Jerry Siegel and George Roussos, where Lois Lane dreams that she has gained superpowers from a blood transfusion from Superman and launches a career as Superwoman. The theme is revisited in a 1947 SupermanIssue #45, in a story titled \\"Lois Lane, Superwoman!\\" ‚Äî (March‚ÄìApril 1947) comic in which a pair of fraudulent magicians cast a \\"spell\\" on Lane, making her believe she has superpowers. Superman is forced to play along with the ruse for a time, using super-speed to invisibly intervene in Lane's adventures, supporting the illusion. She briefly sports a costume modeled on Superman's before the spell is \\"broken\\". A story from Action Comics has Lois actually gaining superpowers from one of Lex Luthor's inventions and launching a short-lived career as \\"Superwoman.\\"Issue #156 ‚Äî released May 1951 Later stories sporadically feature tales in which Lois gains superpowers and functioned as a \\"Superwoman\\" of sorts, but all of these are, like the 1951 tale, temporary. The powers always wear off by the end of the story. A typical example of this is \\"The Turnabout Powers\\" from Superman Family,Issue #207 (May‚ÄìJune 1981) where the Earth-Two Lois Lane gains powers from her husband (the Earth-Two Superman) through the unexpected effect of an exotic extraterrestrial plant Superman brings into their home. The plant's death reverses the effect. Another example is the Batman/Superman: World's Finest mini-series where Mr. Mxyzptlk briefly transforms Lois into a \\"Superwoman\\" with costume and powers. At the end of All-Star Superman #2,Issue #2 Lois Lane is presented with a formula called \\"Exo-Genes\\" created by Superman that allows her to have his powers for 24 hours, and she becomes Superwoman. During her adventures with her new Kryptonian powers,All-Star Superman #3 she is wooed by two superhumans named \\"Samson\\" and \\"Atlas\\", and she is captured by a time-Ultrasphinx. Her powers fade away at the end of the day. Her costume seems to be exactly the same as that of the Anti-Matter Universe's Superwoman, but in Superman's colors. Both outfits were designed by Frank Quitely. In other pre-Crisis imaginary stories‚Äîset outside the main DC continuity within an alternate history or hypothetical future‚ÄîLois Lane gains superpowers. In one of these, Sam Lane is a scientist and astrophysicist. He discovers that Earth's sun will go nova and obliterate the solar system. Sam and his wife Ella place their infant daughter Lois in a starship and send her to Krypton within a \\"power beam\\" that enables FTL travel and permanently modifies the baby's molecular biology. This gives Lois super powers after she reaches her adopted world. Once there, adopted and raised as \\"Kandi Khan,\\" Lois becomes a zookeeper's daughter in Kryptonville. Like Superman in mainstream DC continuity, Kandi/Lois establishes a superhero career, and like Lois and Superman in the mainstream continuity, Supermaid and Kal-El fall for one another. Like Superman in the mainstream DC continuity, Supermaid was also vulnerable to fragments of her perished homeworld (\\"Earthite\\", in this version of events).Edmond Hamilton: \\"Lois Lane, the Supermaid of Krypton !\\" Superman #159 (February 1963) Another imaginary story has Clark Kent and Lois exchange places so that she is from Krypton and Kent is an ordinary human, inquisitive about whether or not Lois Lane was Krypton Girl's secret identity. In 2016, Lois again became Superwoman in the DC Rebirth initiative and appeared as Superwoman in the comic book series Superwoman. The series marks the first ongoing comic book series featuring the Superwoman character. In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Lois and Lana gained superpowers due to the solar energy explosion caused by the death of the New 52 Superman. This results in both Lois and Lana becoming Superwoman with Lois possessing all of Superman's powers, while Lana has the ability to absorb solar energy and release it in other forms. Lois was later seemingly killed, in a similar fashion to the New 52 Superman, while fighting a female Bizzaro. =Luma Lynai= A woman from the distant planet of Staryl, Luma Lynai wins the heart of Superman. Just as Superman derives his powers from a yellow sun, Luma derived her gifts of super-strength and flight from an orange sun. Their romance does not last, as Luma becomes deathly ill under the rays of a yellow sun, and Superman cannot leave Earth undefended. She physically resembles an adult Kara Zor-El, with a similar costume, except instead of being blue-and-red with a pentagonal S shield, Luma's costume is white-and-green with a circular S emblem. =Lois Lane (Crime Syndicate of America's analogue of Wonder Woman)= Superwoman is the name of several fictional characters who are supervillains appearing in stories published by DC Comics. All are evil or corrupted alternate-universe counterparts of Wonder Woman. Superwoman first appeared in Justice League of America #29 (August 1964) alongside the rest of the Crime Syndicate of America. Fiction character biography =Pre-Crisis version= In 1964, an evil counterpart of Wonder Woman from a parallel universe named \\"Superwoman\\" was introduced. This Superwoman was a member of the Crime Syndicate of America, a villainous counterpart of the Justice League of America from the parallel world of \\"Earth-Three\\" (vs. the Justice League's world of \\"Earth-One\\"). Superwoman, like Wonder Woman, was an Amazon, and possessed similar powers of super-strength and flight. Unlike most/all other versions, her golden lasso could change shape into any form she desired, including a giant winged serpent. The Crime Syndicate first came to Earth-One when they felt they were becoming soft without a real challenge to their powers. Ultraman discovered Earth-One after gaining the power to gaze between worlds from exposure to a hunk of Kryptonite. Wonder Woman defeated Superwoman on Earth-1, and Black Canary defeated her on Earth-2 and tied her up in her lasso. Like the other JSA members, Black Canary is transported to Earth-3 when Superwoman accuses her of unfair advantage due to a vibratory force that Power Ring had placed in their bodies. In the showdown on Earth-2 Superwoman was defeated again by Wonder Woman. Earth-Three Pre-Crisis Superwoman by George P√©rez The Crime Syndicate were defeated and imprisoned between Earth-One and Two by Green Lantern in a green bubble. Later the Crime Syndicate were freed by the time travelling villain Per Degaton after he was caught up in a time- storm, discovered their bubble, and freed them. They tried to get him, but he revealed he had made sure he and his Time Machine would vibrate at a different speed to them, meaning they could not touch him. They helped him change history and conquer Earth-2 by stealing nuclear missiles from the Cuban Missile Crisis of Earth Prime, and when the Syndicate betrays him they are sent to 1982 of Earth-1, as he had made sure this would happen when they touched him. They materialized on the JLA's satellite headquarters and defeated the heroes. The JSA were imprisoned in their prison, but the combined powers of Starman and Doctor Fate got them out. They helped him again when the JLA tried to restore history, though were planning to betray him. When Degaton was defeated this timeline was erased and the Syndicate was re-imprisoned. In the Pre-Crisis DCU any Amazon seen without her nonremovable indestructible bracelets was in fact driven mad. Superwoman was never seen with bracelets and this was part of her look to show she was, in fact, an evil aging Amazon (she also had a streak of grey hair). On the original Pre-Crisis Earth-Three, Superwoman and Lois Lane are two separate people, with Lois working as a reporter for the Daily Star just like Earth-Two and even having a short-lived romance with Captain Comet when he came to her universe while chasing the Secret Society of Super-Villains across multiple realities. The Pre-Crisis version of Superwoman was killed, along with the rest of the CSA, when they were trying to save Earth-Three from being destroyed by the Anti-Monitor's antimatter wave.Crisis on Infinite Earths #1 During the Convergence storyline, Superwoman was on death row after an accidental death happened to the Earth- Three version of Bruno Mannheim during the attack on Earth-Three's Metropolis. Due to the Rogue Hunter's interference, the Crime Syndicate failed to rescue Superwoman from death row as the electric chair was activated.Convergence: Crime Syndicate #1 =Post-Crisis antimatter version= In Post-Crisis continuity, as established in the 2000 graphic novel JLA: Earth 2 by Grant Morrison, Superwoman (and the rest of the Crime Syndicate) comes from a parallel world similar to Earth, but located in an antimatter universe (also home to the planet Qward). Superwoman continues to make occasional appearances as a member of the Crime Syndicate, most recently appearing in storylines in the Justice League and Superman comics. Unlike her pre-Crisis counterpart, her magic lasso doesn't change shape but releases the inhibitions of anyone tied to it (just as Wonder Woman's compels victims to tell the truth). Bizarrely she also possesses heat vision, as Superman and Ultraman do, although there is no explanation for this. Taking the alias Lois Lane, Superwoman is an Amazon by birth, and has risen through the ranks to become the chief editor of the Daily Planet in what she calls \\"Patriarch's World\\". This disguise resembles Wonder Woman's secret identity of Diana Prince. At the Planet, Superwoman is shown to upset her colleagues; the antimatter-Cat Grant refers to Superwoman as \\"Queen Bitch\\",\\"JLA: Earth 2\\" and negatively alludes to her \\"friendship\\" with the antimatter Jimmy Olsen. In her later appearances, it is stated that prior to taking on Lois Lane's identity, Superwoman was born on Damnation Island, presumably the Antimatter counterpart to Themyscira (or \\"Paradise Island\\"). It is mentioned that she had murdered all of her fellow Amazons, and upon meeting Donna Troy, she becomes ecstatic over the prospect of being able to murder another one of her kind for the first time in years.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #50 The Antimatter Universe's version of Superwoman is the first version of the character to combine Diana of Themyscira and Lois Lane. Jimmy Olsen is the only civilian who knows of Superwoman's secret identity. A compliant sexual deviant, he does what she tells him in exchange for the favor of watching when she changes her outfit and receiving pieces of it for his \\"disguise kit\\". He is so besotted that he ignores her gibes and insults, even when she tauntingly refers to him as, \\"Superwoman's Snitch, Jimmy Olsen,\\" and prints it in the Planet. Also in the Earth 2 story, her lover Ultraman hates Superwoman's frigidity towards him. Meanwhile, she is carrying on a torrid affair with Owlman, and they sneak trysts whenever they feel Ultraman is not watching. However, from his floating fortress (the antimatter counterpart to the Fortress of Solitude), Ultraman doesn't hesitate to fire warning bursts of heat vision towards them whenever he catches them together. =52 and Countdown incarnation= In 52 Week 52, a recreation of Earth-3 was shown as a part of the new Multiverse. In the depiction were characters that are altered versions of the original Justice Society of America, including Wonder Woman. The character is not identified in 52, but later in Countdown to Final Crisis, which identifies her as Superwoman of the \\"Crime Society of America\\", on an alternative world which is a reversed version of Earth-2. Based on comments by Grant Morrison, this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-Three, making this a new character unrelated to previous versions. Grant Morrison also suggests that the Earth-3 and Antimatter Superwomen both exist post-52. Like the antimatter iteration of the character, she is indeed both a Lois Lane and Wonder Woman counterpart, despite possessing Kryptonian abilities such as heat vision. In Countdown, she is recruited into the Monarch's army but has her eyes gouged out by Red Robin (Jason Todd) of New Earth, who may or may not have been carrying Kryptonite. =The New 52 incarnation= Following DC's 2011 reboot event, \\"The New 52\\", characters from Earth-3 are again revised. Beginning in 2013 comics, Superwoman, once again the alternate version of both Lois Lane and Wonder Woman, is one of the members of the Crime Syndicate to arrive from Earth-3 at the conclusion of the \\"Trinity War\\" event.Justice League Vol. 2 #23 During the Forever Evil storyline, Superwoman and Owlman raid Arkham Asylum where they end up capturing Nightwing. During the Crime Syndicate's broadcast, Superwoman reveals Nightwing's identity on the broadcastForever Evil #1 While Grid looks over the biographies of the other Syndicate members, he finds that while data on the other members are there, Superwoman's were deleted, leaving her true past and identity still a total mystery. She is also pregnant, and engaging in affairs with both Owlman and Ultraman.Justice League vol. 2, #26 It was finally revealed that Superwoman is in a relationship with the crazed Alexander Luthor of Earth-3, who uses the power of the lightning and goes by the name Mazahs. She betrays Ultraman, revealing she and Luthor are carrying a child who is prophesied to bring an end to the world. After Mazahs is killed by the Luthor of the main universe, Superwoman is placed in captivity. Immune to Wonder Woman's lasso of truth, Wonder Woman attempts traditional interrogation of her counterpart about the entity that destroyed their world, but Superwoman does not reveal any information. Just then, she ends up announcing \\"The baby. It kicked.\\"Forever Evil #7 During the Darkseid War storyline, Superwoman is freed from A.R.G.U.S. custody by the Justice League in order to help the Justice League deal with the Anti-Monitor.Justice League vol. 2 #47 During the battle with the New Gods, Superwoman starts to give birth. Right after she gave birth to her son, on order from Owlman, Superwoman used her child to absorb the Omega Sanction from Lex Luthor. While boasting of her child's strength, Superwoman was disintegrated by Grail who took the baby. The baby was subsequently used by Grail as a host to resurrect her father, Darkseid, who had been slain by the Anti-Monitor.Justice League vol. 2 #50 =Gender-swapped Superman= Superwoman along with Batwoman and Superlad from Superman/Batman#24 In Superman #349 (\\"The Turnabout Trap!\\"),Superman, volume 1, #349 (in a story entitled \\"The Turnabout Trap!\\") Superman returns from an interstellar mission to find that everyone on Earth is of the opposite sex. Among them are Penny White (a female Perry White), Jenny Olsen (a female Jimmy Olsen), Louis Lane (a male Lois Lane), Batwoman (a female Batman, rather than the actual character), Wonder Warrior (a male Wonder Woman; DC Comics could not use the name Wonder Man at the time because Marvel Comics holds the trademark. A later character did use the name Wonder Man, however‚Äîsee below.), Black Condor (a male Black Canary), Superlad (a male Supergirl), and Superwoman (his female counterpart) herself. Believing he crossed into a parallel universe, Superman flies back to space to find a dimensional portal but is blocked by an invisible barrier. He notices the parallelism fails when he sees Superwoman and Clara Kent (Superwoman's presumed secret identity) are two separate people. When he confronts Superwoman he discovers that he is regarded as a super-villain in this gender-reversed world, which leads to a battle with Superwoman, Superlad, and Wonder Warrior. They manage to trap Superman with Wonder Warrior on guard, but he manages to escape and takes Wonder Warrior's magic lasso with him. Superman figures out that his foe Mr. Mxyzptlk is behind this gender-reversed world. This was partly due to the discrepancy of Clara Kent and Superwoman being different people. However, Mxyzptlk's biggest mistake was being too vain to give himself a reverse-gender counterpart in Superwoman's rogues gallery in The Daily Planet morgue; all of Superwoman's foes were reverse-gender counterparts to Superman's foes (Leslie Luthor (Lex Luthor), Bizaress (Bizarro) and the Toywoman (Toyman)) - except for Mxyzptlk. Superman discovers as well that he was never in a parallel universe, but rather on Earth, which Mxyzptlk had altered with his magic. After using Wonder Warrior's magic lasso to make Mxyzptlk say his name backwards and thus returning him to his native dimension, the effects of Mxyzptlk's magic (including the existence of Superwoman) vanish, returning the Earth to normal. Upon his return to his Clark Kent identity, he is startled to discover there is still a Louis Lane, but he turns out to be Lois Lane's cousin. Later stories, including Countdown and The Multiversity would revisit the concept of a gender-reversed Superman known as Superwoman, and designated those stories as taking place on Earth-11 of the DC Multiverse. Laurel Kent A new Superwoman named Laurel, apparently a female version of Superman from a parallel Earth (now identified as Earth-11), appeared for the first time in Superman/Batman,Issue #23 ‚Äî released November 2005 and was featured an issue later.Issue #24 In Earth 11's alternate universe, much like in the one featured in \\"The Turnabout Trap!\\", reversed-gender characters exist relative to that resident on New Earth: there is a Batwoman (female Batman), Superlad (male Supergirl), and a female Darkseid known as the \\"Dark Queen\\". (It is notable that in pre-Crisis continuity, \\"Laurel Kent\\" was the name of a 30th-century descendant of Superman who occasionally appeared in stories featuring the Legion of Super-Heroes, and was replaced in continuity by Laurel Gand.) In December 2007, Superwoman and Batwoman were featured in Countdown Presents: The Search for Ray Palmer: Superwoman/Batwoman #1. It features Earth-11 as part of the new DC Multiverse and presents a male version of Wonder Woman called Wonder Man, who originates from a society of male Amazons. It also depicts that world's version of Amazons Attack!. Superwoman (Kristin Wells). Art by Gil Kane, 1983. The Multiversity Guidebook, released as part of The Multiversity showed new versions of the characters from Earth-11, more closely resembling New Earth after the Flashpoint event, with equivalent costumes to their New Earth counterparts, indicating their world had also been affected by the Flashpoint storyline, though the exact nature of those changes is unrevealed. The Aquawoman of Earth-11 would become a member of Justice League Incarnate, a team which formed as a result of the Multiversity event. She would go on to help Superwoman of Earth-11 as well as a number of other Superman counterparts to escape from a being called Prophecy, who was attempting to drain their powers in order to fight an unknown future threat. Together with Aquawoman, Superman, The New Super-Man of China, and the Justice League Incarnate, Prophecy was defeated, and Superwoman and the other Superman counterparts would return to their worlds and times. =Kristin Wells= Another version of Superwoman, this one a heroic character, came about in the form of Kristin Wells, who was created by Superman comic writer Elliot S! Maggin. Wells first appeared in Maggin's Superman novel Miracle Monday, but he later introduced her in the pages of DC Comics Presents as Superwoman. The character Wells is a 29th-century descendant of Jimmy Olsen. Wells time travels to the 20th century, where the technology she had brought from the future gives her superpowers. It is this iteration of the character which appears briefly in Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow? which creates a continuity problem in that she had already revealed Jimmy Olsen's final fate: to become a great editor like Perry White. =Dana Dearden= Obsessed Superman fan Dana Dearden dated Jimmy Olsen to get close to Superman, and when that didn't work she stole mystic artifacts which granted her the strength of Hercules, the speed (and flight) of Hermes, the thunderbolts of Zeus, and the sight of Heimdall. Dana donned a green-and-purple uniform, with \\"Superwoman\\" written down the leggings, and called herself Superwoman, and tried to get Superman to fall in love with her. He rejected her advances, and Jimmy called her \\"Obsession\\". She vanished attempting to help Superman rescue people from a burning ship.Adventures of Superman #538 (September 1996) The Dana Dearden Superwoman When Superman was split into his Red and Blue energy forms, Superwoman returned hoping that one of the Supermen would return her feelings, but Maxima intervened, and used her telepathy to convince Superwoman that she would destroy Superman with her love.Superman: The Man of Tomorrow #10 (January 1998) The telepathic illusion wore off and she would try to win Superman over again, this time in a red-and-blue costume very similar to his, and claimed to be his wife in response to a recent photograph of Superman wearing a wedding ring. During a subsequent attack of humans using the DMN drug‚Äîwhich turned the users into violent demons until the \\"high\\" was over‚ÄîSuperman convinced her to help him stop the DMN users, arguing that, if she truly loved him, she would help him do his duty rather than attack him for potentially picking someone else over her. She died trying to protect him from one of the DMN users when it almost struck him in the back while he was distracted since she knew he was vulnerable to magic.Adventures of Superman #574 (January 2000) =Lucy Lane= Lucy Lane first appeared as Superwoman in Supergirl (vol. 5) #35 (January 2009), her costume a nod to that of the Bronze Age Superwoman Kristin Wells and containing a containment field that simulated Kryptonian powers. However, Lucy's identity was not revealed until near the story arc's end. During her tenure as Superwoman, she was blackmailed by her father, General Sam Lane, into performing acts of villainy such as murdering Agent Liberty, who had been spying on General Lane and Lex Luthor.Action Comics #873 This resulted in her being the focus of the Supergirl Faces of Evil issue. thumb Lucy Lane later attacks Reactron, which tipped off readers that Superwoman was not Kryptonian, since the villain's Gold Kryptonite power source had no effect on her.Supergirl #38 Supergirl unmasks Superwoman,Supergirl #40 and accidentally kills her by rupturing the containment field of her suit, causing Lucy's body to contort and explode.Supergirl #41 In the Supergirl annual Lucy is brought back to life by the suit as it steals the life of another person. The suit is then revealed to be a magical creation of Mirabai of the Forlorn, ally of Sam Lane, who mystically infused in it the genetic abilities of several alien races of Kryptonian might: when Supergirl ruptured it, the backlash permanently altered Lucy Lane into being a composite alien being of human appearance herself, with inherent Kryptonian abilities.Supergirl (Vol. 5)#50(February 2010) This Superwoman was last seen as a prisoner after Sam Lane's machinations during the War of the Supermen storyline came to an end, though it was hinted she would escape at some point in the future. However, the launch of The New 52 ended that storyline. =Lana Lang= When Superman died, Lana Lang and Lois Lane both absorbed energy released from his body and the two women developed superhuman powers. Lana gained the power to convert solar radiation into various forms of electromagnetic energy, while Lois developed powers similar to Superman's. Both Lana and Lois became Superwoman. After Lois' death, Lana became the sole Superwoman. During Superman Reborn, it was revealed that the powers Lois and Lana received were the leftover energy from the New-52, Superman. The Post-Crisis Superman took that energy into himself to become an amalgam leaving Lana seemingly powerless and confused. However, some energy remained within her suit which was later found to be Red Kryptonite radiation. Other uses Various comic stories, pre- and post-Crisis, offer glimpses of possible futures assuming that one of the various incarnations of Supergirl would eventually change her codename to Superwoman upon reaching adulthood. One example is a 1980 issue of The Superman Family,#200 ‚Äî released April 1980 in which all the stories are set in the then-near future 1999 or 2000 (the timeframe is cited only as \\"the turn of the century\\") with the characters aged appropriately, including an older Linda Danvers (Kara Zor-El) who divides her time between her career as Superwoman and serving as governor of Florida. Alternatively, some stories assume one of Superman's female descendants would assume the name \\"Superwoman\\", like his daughter Kara and great-granddaughter Lara from the Elseworlds series, Superman & Batman: Generations. In other media =Television= * A version of the Lois Lane Superwoman appeared in Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman in the season three episode \\"Ultra Woman\\" portrayed by Teri Hatcher.November 12, 1995 (Episode 7) Superman lost his powers when a Red Kryptonite laser beam hit him and transferred his powers to Lois. Both of them were unaware of the transfer until Lois pulled down an iron gate with her bare hands. Martha Kent made her a costume and Clark introduces her to Metropolis as Ultra Woman. * Two versions of Superwoman appeared in the television series Smallville. In season eight, Lana Lang gains superpowers. In the season ten episode \\"Prophecy\\", Jor-El gave Lois all of Clark's Kryptonian abilities for 24 hours. =Films= * The Crime Syndicate version of Superwoman appears in Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, voiced by Gina Torres. Like most versions of Wonder Woman's Crime Syndicate counterpart, Superwoman and Wonder Woman are rivals and the Amazon Princess easily bested her evil counterpart in combat during the final battle. As in JLA: Earth 2, Superwoman has a relationship with Owlman and collaborates with him of his plot to destroy the multiverse. However, she also develops a crush toward Batman, who spurns her advances after her \\"Made Men\\" (resembling the Shazam Family) invaded the JLA Watchtower which lured Batman to her mansion. There is no mention of her having a relationship with Ultraman. Superwoman is arrested after the Justice League and the Marines led by President Slade Wilson defeat her and the rest of the Syndicate. * The Lois Lane version of Superwoman is featured in the All-Star Superman animated movie, voiced by Christina Hendricks. =Video games= * The Crime Syndicate version of Superwoman appears as one of the central antagonists of Lego DC Super-Villains, voiced again by Gina Torres. She and the Crime Syndicate pose as the Justice Syndicate at the time when the Justice League go missing.

It designs, constructs and races cars for companies and teams such as Aston Martin, Mini and Volkswagen. Its advanced technology division now applies this motorsport engineering approach to deliver engineering solutions into automotive OEMs, aerospace, defence, marine and other sectors, which now represents more than half its turnover. Prodrive also has a specialist composite division based in Milton Keynes where it manufactures lightweight carbon composite CFRP and visual carbon components for many supercars and increasingly for the luxury automotive, aerospace and marine sectors. Prodrive first became well known for its involvement in the World Rally Championship with the Subaru World Rally Team, developing championship-winning cars for Colin McRae and Richard Burns, which now reside in the Prodrive heritage collection alongside many other of its classic race and rally cars at its new Banbury headquarters. While the Subaru World Rally programme ended in 2008, today its motorsport manufacturer programmes include Aston Martin Racing in the FIA World Endurance Championship and VW in the Chinese Rally Championship. It also created the Megane RX for GC Kompetition for the FIA World Rallycross Championship. The company employs nearly 500 in the UK at operations in Banbury and Milton Keynes. History Prodrive was founded in 1984 by Ian Parry and David Richards, the latter is now the chairman of the group. Their first involvement in motorsport was with the Rothmans Porsche Rally Team, running a Porsche 911 SC RS for Henri Toivonen at the European Rally Championship and for Saeed Al Hajri in the Middle East Rally Championship. In 1986, Prodrive ran a MG Metro 6R4 in British and Irish rally championships. In 1987, they expanded into touring cars, running BMW M3 in the British Touring Car Championship. They were the outright 1988 champions, and class B champions in 1989 and 1990. There were plans for a works entry with Mercedes during 1993 and into 1994, with Bernd Schneider slated to drive, but plans were shelved. Since then, Prodrive has run touring car programmes for Alfa Romeo (1995) for Honda (1997-8), for Ford (1999-2000 BTCC champions in 2000) and with Volvo in FIA European Touring Car Championship (ETCC). In 1990, Prodrive started rallying with Subaru, a relationship which lasted until December 2008, when the global economic downturn forced their withdrawal from World Rallying. During the near 20-year partnership, the team won three drivers' WRC titles for Colin McRae (1995), Richard Burns (2001) and Petter Solberg (2003), as well as three manufacturers' titles (1995,96,97). In the winter of 1998, the company were approached by Russian oil company Lukoil to enable them to enter motorsports sponsorship. As entries to Formula 3000 were restricted, Richards agreed a deal with family friend Christian Horner that Prodrive would take a 50% stake in Horner's Arden International, in return for Horner retiring from driving and becoming team manager. As a result, Arden signed Viktor Maslov as a driver under the Lukoil deal from 1999. In 1999, investment group Apax Partners bought 49% of Prodrive. Horner hence exercised the option to buy back the Prodrive stake in Arden. In 2007 Apax sold their investment in the business and in 2008, The Investment Dar company, based in Kuwait, acquired a share of the business. Proving ground in Warwickshire In 2000 Prodrive expanded out of its base in Banbury, UK and bought a private proving ground in Warwickshire to house its automotive technology business. In 2001 the company acquired Tickford and merged this automotive engineering business into its own operations. With Tickford came subsidiary businesses in North America and Australia. The businesses in North America were subsequently sold, while in Australia, the Tickford brand was replaced by the new Ford Performance Vehicles (FPV) brand. Prodrive sold its 51% stake in Ford Performance Vehicles to Ford Australia in 2012. Prodrive also founded Ford Performance Racing in 2003, entering the V8 Supercar series in Australia after purchasing Glenn Seton Racing. This was sold in January 2013.V8 team FPR sold to Melbourne- based pair Sydney Morning Herald 5 January 2013 In 2001, Prodrive entered sports car racing with its own privately developed Ferrari 550 GTS Maranello. Prodrive raced the car until 2004 winning numerous races in the FIA GT and American Le Mans Series. The highlight for the programme was GTS class victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2003. The success of this project led to a full works programme with Aston Martin and the creation of Aston Martin Racing in late 2004, a partnership between Prodrive and the British motor manufacturer. The team won on its debut at the 12 Hours of Sebring in 2005 with its new DBR9 GT1 car. Aston Martin Racing subsequently competed in the American Le Mans Series and at Le Mans with the highlights of the programme being two GT1 class victories at Le Mans in 2007 and 2008. In 2009 the team developed a new LMP1 car and won the 2009 Le Mans Series and was fourth at Le Mans and the fastest petrol powered car. This programme continues today with the team competing in the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) with the Vantage GTE. In 2016 it won the FIA WEC Pro teams' and drivers' titles; in 2017 its fourth Le Mans title and the same year the FIA WEC GTE Am teams' and drivers' titles. In December 2001 Prodrive was brought in to manage the unsuccessful Formula One constructor BAR. Richards was appointed as team principal of BAR. Under Prodrive management the team's fortunes were turned around and by the end of the 2004 season, the BAR Honda F1 team was second in the F1 constructors' championship. At that point the owners, BAT (British American Tobacco), sold the team to Honda. The Prodrive management contract was ended and Prodrive's managing director Nick Fry assumed the role of team principal. Prodrive has subsequently been linked with Formula One on a number of occasions since (see below for details). In March 2007 a consortium led by Prodrive chairman David Richards bought British sports car firm Aston Martin from Ford, bringing Aston Martin back into British control. Prodrive had no financial involvement in the deal. Richards was chairman of Aston from 2007 until the end of 2013 when he stepped down. Richards himself is a long-time Aston Martin enthusiast, and owns an extensive collection of both modern and historic models.This car set a new lap record of the Isle of Man TT circuit for a car Following Subaru‚Äôs withdrawal from the World Rally Championship in 2008, Prodrive began developing a generic rally car for the new 2011 regulations. A works deal was agree with BMW to take MINI back into rallying and the MINI WRC Team competed in the 2011 World Rally Championship. In 2013 Prodrive created the first MINI rallycross based on the MINI JCW World Rally Car. It competed in the Global Rallycross Championship winning on its debut with Liam Doran. In 2018 the team returned to rallycross developing the Megane RX the most advanced rallycross car ever created, which competes in the FIA World Rallycross Championship. Using knowledge gained from developing the MINI. Prodrive developed a near WRC specification VW Golf to compete for the FAW-VW rally team in the Chinese Rally Championship. The car won on its debut and took both the manufacturers‚Äô and drivers‚Äô titles in 2015 as well as further titles in the following years In April 2015 Prodrive relocated its headquarters by the M40 in Banbury to a new facility one mile south but still adjacent to the M40. This houses the Motorsport and Advanced Technology businesses. In 2016 Prodrive developed a one off car for Subaru to set a new record lap of the Isle of Man TT circuit. The car driven by Manxman, Mark Higgins, competing the 37.7 mile circuit at an average speed of 128.671 mph smashing his previous record. The car was then used in 2017 to set a new lap record of the Nurburgring for a foor door saloon. Driven by Richie Stanaway, it recorded a time of 6:57.5. In 2018 it took on the 50 mile Transfaragasan Highway. During the last decade Prodrive‚Äôs non-motorsport activities have grown to represent the majority of the company‚Äôs turnover. Its client base is very diverse and as well as many major car manufacturers includes aerospace, marine and defence businesses. It worked with the Land Rover BAR America‚Äôs Cup team to develop control systems and new technology for the team‚Äôs ‚Äòflying‚Äô catamaran. In 2016 the company also announced its plans to engineer the world‚Äôs lightest folding bike to market, The Hummingbird. World Rally Championship Rally Cyprus 2006 The first Prodrive WRC Car from 1997 In 1990, Prodrive began a long-standing and highly successful relationship with Subaru, forming the Subaru World Rally Team. Prodrive was tasked with running Subaru's rallying campaigns, helping them to three Drivers' and three Manufacturers' World Rally Championships (WRC). Starting out with the Subaru Legacy, they achieved minor success in the WRC with regular drivers Colin McRae and Ari Vatanen. The first Subaru victory in the WRC was by McRae in a Legacy during the 1993 Rally New Zealand. The smaller and more agile Impreza became the platform which Prodrive would be most successful within rally. Scotland‚Äôs Colin McRae won the 1995 World Rally Championship for drivers, followed later by England‚Äôs Richard Burns in 2001 and Norwegian Petter Solberg in 2003. All three championship Subarus were prepared and run by Prodrive. The distinctive blue with yellow colour scheme was a throwback to the early 1990s sponsorship deal with 555, a BAT cigarette brand popular in Asia. After a number of years of poor performances, Subaru announced their withdrawal from the WRC at the end of the 2008 season. On 27 July 2010, it was announced that Prodrive would re-enter the WRC with a limited programme in 2011 with BMW using the MINI Countryman. The MINI WRC Team made its debut at the Italian Rally in Sardinia in 2011. While there is no longer a works team, Prodrive continues to build and run MINIs for customers in the World Rally Championship and national rally series. In 2014, Prodrive developed a new rally car based on the VW Golf specifically for the Chinese Rally Championship. The car now competes for the FAW VW Rally Team in this series with Prodrive support.Prodrive created this rallycross car Rallycross In 2013 Prodrive developed the MINI RX a new rallycross car based on the MINI WRC. It was built to FIA regulations and won on its debut in the Global Rallycross Championship (GRC) in Munich driven by Liam Doran. The car also competed in the GRC in North America. In April 2018, GC KOMPETITION (GCK) unveiled the Megane R.S. RX, the most technologically advanced rallycross car ever created. GCK appointed Prodrive to design the Megane R.S. RX who subsequently operated the team in the 2018 FIA World Rallycross Championship. Formula One Jacques Villeneuve driving for the then Prodrive-run BAR team at the US Grand Prix at Indianapolis in 2003 Starting in the 2002 season, Prodrive was awarded a five-year management contract to run British American Racing (BAR), with David Richards becoming team principal. BAR owners British American Tobacco and Prodrive had a prior relationship with BAT sponsoring Subaru's World Rally Championship team, operated by Prodrive. The team experienced modest results throughout their first two seasons before finishing second in the Constructors' Championship in 2004, with drivers Jenson Button and Takuma Sato. However, Prodrive's contract was terminated early, following their best season after Honda's purchase of BAR. On 28 April 2006, Prodrive were officially granted entry to F1 when the FIA announced the list of entrants to the 2008 Formula One World Championship. FIA president Max Mosley was impressed by Prodrive's bid, which beat off stiff competition from the likes of Carlin Motorsport, the Jean Alesi-led McLaren-supported Direxiv outfit, BAR co-founder Craig Pollock, former Minardi owner Paul Stoddart and ex-Jordan Grand Prix team principal, Eddie Jordan. He revealed that Prodrive have found the finances to support their bid, adding: \\"Prodrive has the best combination of financial backing, technical capability and motorsport experience. Also, Prodrive's chief executive, David Richards, has experience as a Formula One team principal\\". Following a legal challenge by Williams to Prodrive's proposed use of a customer car David Richards announced on 23 November 2007 that Prodrive would not be entering Formula One for the 2008 season. Richards made it clear that it was still the intention of Prodrive to enter Formula One. However, following further clarifications of the rules surrounding the use of customer cars, and the resulting ban on the use of customer chassis from the beginning of the 2009 F1 season, the pursuit of an entry via the customer car route has been abandoned. Richards has previously stated that entry as an independent constructor would be prohibitively expensive. Prodrive boss David Richards was linked to buying out the abandoned Honda team and using it as an output for Prodrive. The attempt was a failure, as Ross Brawn, Nick Fry and the rest of the team's management bought out the team, becoming Brawn GP. On 23 April 2009, Prodrive issued a press release stating that they were considering an F1 entry for the 2010 season, possibly under the Aston Martin Racing brand. On 29 May 2009, it was reported that Prodrive had submitted a formal application for the 2010 season. However, Prodrive was not accepted to the final grid. Prodrive was one of two potential buyers considered by the Renault F1 Team to take-over the team prior to the 2010 season. In April 2010 Prodrive announced it would not apply for the 2011 Formula One season. The slot became available after US F1 Team collapsed. Advanced Technology Prodrive designed and manufactures the rear centre console module for the Range Rover Autobiography Black at its headquarters in Banbury.Prodrive's Advanced Technology business represents more than half the Prodrive Group turnover and works with businesses in the automotive, aerospace, marine and defence sectors. It develops new technologies and systems for clients which include Jaguar Land Rover, McLaren Automotive, Bentley, Rolls Royce (commercial jet engines), Volvo and the Land Rover BAR America's Cup team. The company has a carbon composites manufacturing facility in Milton Keynes making lightweight components for premium vehicle manufacturers, including Jaguar, Aston Martin and Bentley, and the aerospace industry. Current and recent projects include: *Creation of a multiport DC-DC converter using silicon carbide for electric and hybrid applicationsProdrive has developed a highly efficient DC-DC converter for electric and hybrid cars using the latest silicon carbide technology *Design and manufacture of the active aero system for the McLaren P1 *Compact high-powered inverter for a new generation of electric fuel pumps for commercial jet engines *Production of the lightweight carbon bodywork and carbon interior for the McLaren P1 *Design and production of the rear centre console module for the Range Rover Autobiography Black *Development and production of the 800 bhp engine for the Aston Martin Vulcan Development of the first hybrid Ford Transit Prodrive was a technical supplier to the Land Rover BAR team to help develop its America's Cup challenger. Among other areas, it has developed the control systems for the foils which make the boat fly and is manufacturing all the electrical harness for the boat. Hummingbird Bike Hummingbird Bike In 2016 Prodrive announced it was bringing the world‚Äôs lightest folding bike to market. The bike weighing 6.9 kg has a carbon frame, manufactured by Prodrive Composites, and is assembled at its headquarters in Banbury. The bike was launched in 2017 and in 2018 an electric version was introduced. The Fulcrum Prodrive already had a facility at the former RAF Honiley airfield and LucasVarity proving ground near Wroxall, Warwickshire, together with Marcos and TRW.Protest against Formula One plans kenilworthweeklynews.co.uk - 24 March 2006 In March 2006, Prodrive announced its intent to build a ¬£200million, motorsport facility called The Fulcrum.New Formula One plans unveiled BBC News - 1 March 2006Prodrive plans ¬£200m F1 facility itv-f1.com - 13 March 2006 Prodrive's statement in the planning application for the facility ‚Äì which could house as many as 1,000 staff ‚Äì boasted of \\"a motorsport complex which could eventually house Prodrive's new British Prodrive F1 team\\", further cementing Managing Director Richards' intention to return to F1 in 2008. Until the Honiley factory is operational, Prodrive will remain at their existing Banbury headquarters. As of 3 August 2006, Prodrive has won the support of the Warwick District Council planning committee for development of The Fulcrum.Prodrive development approved kenilworthweeklynews.co.uk - 3 August 2006 The permission covers a highly advanced engineering research and development campus, a conference facility called the Catalyst Centre and new access road, a roundabout, infrastructure, parking and landscaping. The plans still have to be presented and agreed by the British government's Department for Communities and Local Government, and there is local opposition via the Fulcrum Prodrive Action Group (FPAG) to protect the rural nature of the community and the safety of the people that live within it. In 2014 the site was sold to Jaguar Land Rover.

The other airship, the R101, was built by the British Air Ministry, but both airships were funded by the Government. R100 was built by the Airship Guarantee Company, a specially created subsidiary of the armaments firm Vickers-Armstrongs, led by Commander Dennis Burney. The design team was headed by Barnes Wallis, later famous for his invention of the bouncing bomb. The design team also included Nevil Shute Norway as the senior stress engineer (see Slide Rule). R100 first flew in December 1929. It made a series of trial flights and a successful return crossing of the Atlantic in July‚ÄìAugust 1930, but following the crash of R101 in October 1930 the Imperial Airship Scheme was terminated and R100 was broken up for scrap. Background R100 was built as part of a British government programme to develop airships to provide passenger and mail transport between Britain and the countries of the British Empire, including India, Australia and Canada. This had its origin in Dennistoun Burney's 1922 proposal for a civil airship development programme to be subsidised by the Government and carried out by a specially established subsidiary of Vickers. When the General Election of 1923 brought Ramsay MacDonald‚Äôs Labour administration to power, the new Air Minister, Lord Thomson formulated the Imperial Airship Scheme in its place. This called for the building of two experimental airships: one, R101, to be designed and constructed under the direction of the Air Ministry, and the other, R100, to be built by the Vickers subsidiary under a fixed price contract. Design and development Composite image representing R100 passing over the Jacques Cartier Bridge in Montreal, August 1930 R100 was constructed at the former RNAS Air Station Howden in Yorkshire, a remote location from Howden and from Hull. Design work began in 1925 while at the same time the somewhat rundown site was put in order and a hydrogen-generating plant installed. The specially established subsidiary of Vickers, the Airship Guarantee Company, faced substantial difficulties. The contract for R100's construction was a fixed price one and it was obvious from very early on that the project would incur a loss, and so economies were made; for instance, only a dozen machine tools were in use for construction of the airship. There were also difficulties in finding skilled workers due to the remoteness of the location, and a large proportion of the workers were local people who had to be trained. Conditions in the unheated airship shed were also poor: the roof leaked, ice formed on the girders in winter, and condensation caused corrosion of the airship's duralumin structure, so that the girders had to be varnished. For three years the assembly work was close behind that of the designers, and the progress of the design work was the determining factor in speed of construction. =Airframe= Graf Zeppelin Since wind tunnel tests showed that a 16-side transverse section had about the same drag as a circular one, both R100 and R101 used a smaller number of longitudinal girders than previous airships to simplify stress calculations. Even so, the calculations for the transverse frames required hand computation that took two or three months to produce a solution for each frame. The thoroughness of the stressing calculations was a consequence of new Air Ministry criteria for the strengths required of airships, formulated after the catastrophic structural failure of R38 in 1921. Fewer longitudinal girders resulted in larger unsupported panels of fabric in the envelope, and flight trials were to prove that the R100's covering was barely adequate. The envelope of R101 was also unsatisfactory and a failure in its cover was possibly a cause of its crash. Barnes Wallis created the frame of the airship using only 11 standard components. The 16 longitudinal girders were formed of three tubes each, formed from strips of Duralumin wound into a helix and riveted together. These connected 15 polygonal transverse frames, which were held in shape by wire bracing connected to a central longitudinal girder running the length of the ship.Masefield 1982, p. 165. A further consequence of the new rules for airframe stress design was that a new way of harnessing the lifting force of the gasbags had to be found. Wallis's solution to this problem later led to his innovative geodesic airframe fuselage and wing design for the Wellesley, Wellington and Windsor bombers. The elevators were aerodynamically balanced but the rudders were unbalanced. When the designers learned that R101 had been fitted with servo motors at a substantial cost in weight and money they thought that they had made a mistake and rechecked their calculations. They eventually concluded that their calculations had been correct: when R100 was flown the controls proved both light and effective, and its control characteristics were compared favourably with those of R101 by N√∂el Atherstone, First Officer of R101.Masefield 1982, p. 189. R100 was built suspended from the roof of its shed. The individual transverse frames were assembled horizontally then lifted up and slung from roof-mounted trackways before being slid into position and attached to the adjacent frames by the longitudinal girders. The ship remained suspended until the gasbags were inflated with hydrogen.Ventry and Kolesnik 1977, p. 137. By mid-1929 the ship's structure was nearly complete and its gasbags were inflated. Following inflation of the gasbags, the outer covering of linen fabric painted with aluminium aircraft dope was put in place, and it was completed at the beginning of November.Ventry and Kolesnik 1977, p. 137. Lift and trim trials were carried out on 11 November: empty weight was and gasbag volume was , giving a standard gross lift of and so a disposable lift of . Deducting for the service load (crew, stores and ballast) this meant the weight available for fuel and payload was .Masefield 1982, pp. 168‚Äì169. = Propulsion = It had originally been intended to design special engines for R100 which would be fuelled by hydrogen and kerosene but after a year's work it was realised that the engine would not be developed in time and it was decided to fit the Beardmore Tornado diesel engine that was being developed for the Air Ministry for installation in R101. At an early stage the Tornado was judged unsuitable because of its weight and other problems, and Wallis settled on the use of six reconditioned Rolls-Royce Condor petrol engines even though the fuel, with its lower flash point, was considered to be a fire risk under tropical conditions.Hartcup 1974, p. 189. The engines were contained in three gondolas, each with one engine driving a 17 ft (5.18 m) diameter tractor propeller and a second driving a 15 ft (4.57 m) diameter pusher propeller. The engines driving the pusher propellers were fitted with a gearbox to provide reverse thrust for docking the airship.Masefield 1982, p. 166. =Passenger and crew accommodation= The passenger and crew accommodation were arranged on three decks occupying a single bay of the structure and entirely contained within the airship's envelope. The lower deck contained the crew accommodation. The second deck had a dining room, which doubled as the passenger lounge, plus the kitchen, 18 four-berth passenger cabins and a gallery on either side for passengers to enjoy the view through the windows built into the skin. The third deck consisted of a gallery running around the dining room and 14 two-berth cabins. Operational history =First flights= R100 made its maiden flight in the morning of 16 December 1929. After departing Howden at 07:53, it flew slowly to York then set course for the Royal Airship Works at Cardington, Bedfordshire, running on five engines since one of the engines had to be shut down because of a cracked water jacket, and completing the mooring process at 13:40.Masefield 1982, pp. 171‚Äì172. A second flight was made the next day, with the intention of making a flight to London, but shortly after slipping the mast a strip of fabric became detached from the lower fin, and the flight was limited to a cruise around Bedfordshire to test control response, lasting 6hr 29 min. The following day, R100 was taken from the mast to No.2 shed at Cardington and work on modifying the wiring holding the cover in place begun: this took until 11 January 1930.Masefield 1982, pp. 172‚Äì173. During a test on 16 January 1930, R100 achieved a speed of .\\"Third Flight Of R100.\\" The Times, Issue 45413, 17 January 1930, p. 14, Column E. At speed a problem with the outer covering became apparent: it tended to ripple and flap excessively in the form of a standing wave. During a fourth flight on 20 January cine film was taken of this phenomenon, which occurred because of the large areas of unsupported fabric; it is also visible in some photographs. A further short flight was made on 20 January before an endurance flight, starting at 09:38 on 27 January when R100 slipped the mast at Cardington and ending at 15:26 on 29 January after more than 53 hours in the air.\\"Return Of R100.\\" The Times, Issue 45424, 30 January 1930, p. 11, Column E. Following this flight it was returned to the shed for work on the cover to be carried out. At the same time the original reconditioned Condor IIIA engines were replaced by six new Condor IIIBs and some weight was eliminated by reducing the amount of passenger accommodation. The work was complete by the end of April but on 24 April it was caught by a gust while being walked out of the shed, damaging the tail surfaces. The wind prevented it being replaced in the shed, so it was moored to the mast.Masefield 1982, pp. 198‚Äì199. It was not possible to return it to the shed for repairs until the morning of 27 April. Repairs took longer than expected, and R100 remained in the shed until 21 May, when it made a 24-hour flight intended to test the new engine installation and modifications to the cover. R100's contract had originally called for a demonstration flight to India. The decision to use petrol engines resulted in a change in destination to Canada, as it was considered that a flight to the tropics with petrol aboard would be too hazardous. All being well, it was planned to set off for Canada on 25 May. During the flight of 21 May the conical tail section collapsed due to unexpected aerodynamic pressure, and it was returned to the shed where the original tail section was replaced by a hemispherical cap designed and made by the Royal Airship Works,Masefield 1982, pp. 203‚Äì204. reducing the airship's length by =Transatlantic Voyage to Canada= Canadian Bank of Commerce building in Toronto, Canada, then the highest building in the British Empire (August 1930). The rippling of the airship's cover is visible. Shortly before R101's flights in June 1930, the Cardington engineers tentatively suggested that the long flights to Canada and India might be postponed until 1931 on the grounds that neither of the two airships was fit to make a lengthy flight at their current developmental stage.Masefield 1982, p. 206. The R100 team replied that their airship was perfectly capable of flying to Canada, and that the Canadian flight was a part of their contract. R100 departed for Canada on 29 July 1930, reaching its mooring mast at the St-Hubert, Quebec Airport (outside Montreal) in 78 hours, having covered the great circle route of at an average ground speed of . The airship stayed at Montreal for 12 days with over 100,000 people visiting the airship each day while it was moored there, and a song was composed by La Bolduc to make fun of the people's fascination with R100. It also made a 24-hour passenger-carrying flight to Ottawa, Toronto, and Niagara Falls while in Canada. The airship departed on its return flight on 13 August, reaching Cardington after a 57¬Ω hour flight. Nevil Shute later suggested in Slide Rule: Autobiography of an Engineer that the success of R100's Canadian flight indirectly led to the R101 disaster. Prior to the transatlantic flight, the Cardington team could suggest that neither airship was ready for a performance of such duration. However, when R100 returned in triumph they had to either make the flight to India or admit defeat ‚Äì which would have meant discredit with the consequent danger of losing their jobs. He said that his team \\"guessed that their ship was a bad airship, but did not realise\\" (because of secrecy at Cardington) \\"how bad the other ship was.\\" =The end of the British airships= The tale of the design of R100 and its claimed superiority to R101 is told in Shute's Slide Rule: Autobiography of an Engineer, first published in 1954. Although flawed and not quite as overwhelmingly superior as Nevil Shute Norway implied, R100 represented the best that conventional airship technology in Britain had to offer at the time. R101 suffered in comparison partly because of its many groundbreaking but ultimately dubious innovations, and also because of the weight of its diesel engines. In lifting efficiency, both dirigibles were inferior to the smaller LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin. After R101 crashed and burned in France, en route to India on 5 October 1930, the Air Ministry ordered R100 grounded. It was deflated and hung up in its shed at Cardington for a year whilst three options were considered: a complete refit of R100 and continuation of tests for the eventual construction of R102; static testing of R100 and retention of about 300 staff to keep the programme \\"ticking over\\"; or retention of staff and the scrapping of the airship. In November 1931, it was decided to sell R100 for scrap. The entire framework of the ship was flattened by steamrollers and sold for less than ¬£600.\\"R100 Meets End.\\" Popular Aviation, October 1932, p. 225.

Governor Moore had been Southern S. S. Company's Charles Morgan, named for the firm's founder and built at New York in 1854 as a schooner- rigged, low pressure, walking beam-engined, seagoing steamer. She was seized at New Orleans, Louisiana by Brigadier General Mansfield Lovell, CSA, in mid- January 1862 \\"for the public service.\\" As a gunboat, renamed for Louisiana's Governor Thomas Overton Moore, her stem was reinforced for ramming by two strips of flat railroad iron at the waterline, strapped and bolted in place, with pine lumber and cotton-bale barricades to protect her boilers, but the Governor Moore was never commissioned as a ship in the Confederate States Navy. The larger of two similar cotton-clads owned and operated by the State of Louisiana, Governor Moore was commanded for some time by Lieutenant Beverly Kennon, CSN, then serving as Commander in the Louisiana Provisional Navy without pay. She distinguished herself in the battle of 24 April 1862, when Admiral David Farragut, USN, passed Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip before dawn en route to capture New Orleans. After a furious exchange of raking fire, Governor Moore twice rammed USS Varuna, and a third thrust from another cottonclad forced Varuna aground. Next attacking USS Cayuga, Governor Moore exposed herself to fire from most of the Union flotilla. With practically her whole upper hamper shot away and 64 men dead or dying, she went out of command, drifting helplessly to shore, where her captain, pilot, and a seaman set her afire. Governor Moore blew up while they and three other survivors were being captured by USS Oneida's boats to be imprisoned on board USS Colorado; two-thirds of the two dozen or more crew members escaped into the marshes, the rest being captured by other ships' launches; no one drowned. CSS Governor Moore after the fight \\"The pennant and remains of the ensign were never hauled down,\\" wrote Kennon from Colorado. \\"The flames that lit our decks stood faithful sentinels over their halyards until they, like the ship, were entirely consumed. I burned the bodies of the slain. Our colors were shot away three times. I hoisted them myself twice; finally every stripe was taken out of the flag, leaving a small constellation of four little stars only, which showed to our enemy how bravely we had defended them.\\" Battles and Leaders of the Civil War Vol II.p.85The ship sank with the Louisiana's colors flying.(It is unclear if the flag referred to was the Confederate Stars and Bars or Louisiana State banner of January 1861; the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships claims the latter.)

Early life and education King was born on Norfolk Island, to Philip Gidley King and Anna Josepha King n√©e Coombe, and named after his father's mentor, Admiral Arthur Phillip (1738‚Äì1814), (first governor of New South Wales and founder of the British penal colony which later became the city of Sydney in Australia), which explains the difference in spelling of his and his father's first names. King was sent to England for education in 1796, and he joined the Royal Naval Academy, at Portsmouth, in county Hampshire, England in 1802. King entered the Royal Navy in 1807, where he was commissioned lieutenant in 1814. Expeditions in Australia King was assigned to survey the parts of the Australian coast not already examined by Royal Navy officer, Matthew Flinders, (who had already made three earlier exploratory voyages between 1791 and 1810, including the first circumnavigation of Australia) and made four voyages between December 1817 and April 1822. Amongst the 19-man crew were Allan Cunningham (botanist), John Septimus Roe and the aborigine Bungaree. The first three trips were in the 76 tonne cutter , but the vessel was grounded in 1829. The Admiralty instructed King to discover whether there was any river 'likely to lead to an interior navigation into this great continent'. The Colonial Office had given instructions to collect information about topography, fauna, timber, minerals, climate, and the natives and the prospects of developing trade with them. From February to June 1818, the coast was surveyed as far as Van Diemen Gulf and there were many meetings with Aboriginals and Malay proas. In June the Mermaid visited Timor and then returned to Sydney, arriving on 29 July. Next December and January King surveyed Macquarie Harbour in Van Diemen's Land and sailed in May 1819 for Torres Strait. King took John Oxley as far as the Hastings River, and continued on to survey the coast between Cape Wessel and Admiralty Gulf. King returned to Sydney on 12 January 1820. Voyages of King King's fourth voyage was undertaken in the 154 tonne sloop HMS Bathurst. The ship headed north, through Torres Strait and to the north-west coast of the continent, including the Dampier Archipelago. Further survey of the west coast was made after a visit to Mauritius. Valuable contributions had been made to the exploration of Australia. Expeditions to South America King had been promoted to commander in July 1821, and in April 1823 returned to England. He subsequently commanded the survey vessel HMS Adventure, and in company with HMS Beagle, spent five years surveying the complex convoluted coasts around the Strait of Magellan (1826‚Äì1830) at the southern tip of South America. At the same time, King put together a unique collection of Patagonian objects from local tribes living in Tierra del Fuego, which was later donated to the British Museum in London.British Museum CollectionBritish Museum CollectionBritish Museum Collection In addition to written records, King also lent his hand to drawing and watercolour painting for illustrations, some of which were later used to illustrate his accounts. The result was presented at a meeting of the Royal Geographical Society in 1831. His eldest son, also named Philip Gidley King, accompanied his father and continued as a midshipman on HMS Beagle (1832‚Äì1836) on the continuing survey of Patagonia under Robert FitzRoy, in the company of noted scientist Charles Darwin (1809‚Äì1882). King owned a property at Dunheved in the western suburbs of Sydney where he entertained Charles Darwin on Darwin's last night in Sydney in January 1836. Later life The funeral of Rear Admiral Phillip Parker King, 1856, painted by Conrad Martens King was appointed to the first New South Wales Legislative Council in 1829, however he was absent from the colony and did not take his seat and was replaced by John Campbell. When King returned to the colony in 1832 he pressed for his reappointment to the Council, however he was not re- appointed until February 1839. In April the same year King was appointed resident commissioner of the Australian Agricultural Company, a position he held for ten years. King offered to resign from the Council on accepting this appointment, but his resignation was not accepted until October. King was again appointed to the Legislative Council in 1850, and was elected as the member for the Counties of Gloucester and Macquarie in 1851 In 1855 King was promoted to Rear admiral on the retired list. King was a Fellow of the Royal Society. King died on 26 February 1856 at North Sydney. Family King married Harriet Lethbridge in 1817 prior to sailing to New South Wales. Harriet died at Ashfield, Sydney, on 19 December 1874. Together they had eight children including : *Philip Gidley (1817‚Äì1904) stock manager of the Australian Agricultural Co & later a member of the Legislative Council. * John (1820‚Äì1895) * (William) Essington (1821‚Äì1910) *Rev.

He was also the former lead guitarist of the bands Drugstore Fanatics and Bellusira. Biography He was present on Static-X's debut album, Wisconsin Death Trip, but left the band prior to the recording of their second album, Machine, citing personal problems due to excessive touring. However, he did still contribute keyboards to the record. He rejoined Static-X after the firing of their then-current guitarist, Tripp Eisen, at the end of the recording process of the 2005 album Start a War, and was present to record their fifth album, Cannibal. Between his stints in Static-X, he formed another, less aggressive band called Revolve. Drawing comparisons to Tool and Pink Floyd, they were very successful locally and played several concerts in and around the Los Angeles, California area. They released several demos as free downloads on their website, and released one EP containing several reworked versions of previously released demos, as well as a few new tracks. Koichi Fukuda has a son named Naoki Fukuda, born on August 8th, 2008. On Fukuda's rejoining into the band, frontman Wayne Static said: As of February 10, 2010, Fukuda joined Drugstore Fanatics when Static-X disbanded. Fukuda contributed to the KMFDM album, WTF?!, playing guitar on the song \\"Come On ‚Äì Go Off\\". Fukuda also contributed to Wednesday 13's 2011 Remix EP, \\"Re-Animated\\". The tracks from the EP were re-released as part of Disc 4 for Wednesday's \\"Dead Meat: 10 Years of Blood, Feathers & Lipstick\\" box set under the Disc title: \\"Re-Animated Resurrected\\". The disc also featured extra remixes by Koichi. In 2015, Fukuda was in the Australian rock band Bellusira, working out of Los Angeles. On October 23, 2018, it was announced that Fukuda ‚Äì along with the other two surviving original members, bassist Tony Campos and drummer Ken Jay ‚Äì would be involved in a reunion of Static-X, who were planning to release a new album and tour in 2019 in honor of the memory of their former bandmate Wayne Static.

He started college at the age of 15 and received his bachelor's degree from the City College of New York in 1937, where he took additional courses in biology, chemistry and math in addition to the required curriculum there. He earned a master's degree from Harvard University in 1938, having majored in biology. As part of a plan to accumulate enough money to pay for further graduate studies, Karle took a position in Albany, New York with the New York State Department of Health, where he developed a method to measure dissolved fluoride levels, a technique that would become a standard for water fluoridation. He enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1940 and met his future wife, Isabella Lugoski, who was sitting at an adjoining desk during his first course in physical chemistry. The two married in 1942. They were both supervised in their Ph.D. studies by physical chemist Lawrence Brockway. Though Karle completed his studies in 1943, he was awarded his Ph.D. the following year. Jerome Karle was a former president of both the American Crystallographic Association (ACA) (1972) and the IUCr (1981-1984), as well as a co-recipient of the 1985 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on direct methods. Among the many additional honors he received for his work, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1976, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1986, and the American Philosophical Society in 1990. Research and Nobel Prize Starting in 1943, after completing graduate studies, Karle worked on the Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago with his wife Dr. Isabella Karle, one of the youngest scientists and few women on the project. In 1944, they returned to the University of Michigan, where Karle worked on a project for the United States Naval Research Laboratory. In 1946, they moved to Washington, D.C. to work for the Naval Research Laboratory. Karle and Herbert A. Hauptman were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1985 for their work in using X-ray scattering techniques to determine the structure of crystals, a technique that is used to study the biological, chemical, metallurgical and physical characteristics. They were able to employ the Sayre equation in centrosymmetric structure, developing the so-called direct methods. Through isolating the position of the atoms in a crystal, the molecular structure of the material being studied can be determined, allowing processes to be designed to duplicate the molecules being studied. This technique has played a major role in the development of new pharmaceutical products and other synthesized materials.

Training In the United States, pediatric ophthalmologists are physicians who have completed medical school, a 1-year internship, 3-year residency in ophthalmology, and a 1-year fellowship in pediatric ophthalmology and strabismus. Pediatric ophthalmology fellowships in the United States are accredited by the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus. Clinical expertise Pediatric ophthalmologists focus on the development of the visual system and the various diseases that disrupt visual development in children. Pediatric ophthalmologists also have expertise in managing the various ocular diseases that affect children. Pediatric ophthalmologists are qualified to perform complex eye surgery as well as to manage children's eye problems using glasses and medications. Many ophthalmologists and other physicians refer pediatric patients to a pediatric ophthalmologist for examination and management of ocular problems due to children's unique needs. In addition to children with obvious vision problems, children with head turns, head tilts, squinting of the eyes, or preferred head postures (torticollis) are typically referred to a pediatric ophthalmologist for evaluation. Pediatric ophthalmologists typically also manage adults with eye movement disorders (such as nystagmus or strabismus) due to their familiarity with strabismus conditions. Eye problems in children Public education poster urging eye exams for children (Works Progress Administration, circa 1937) Children experience a variety of eye problems, many quite distinct from adult eye diseases. Pediatric ophthalmologists are specially trained to manage the following disorders: *Infections (Conjunctivitis). *Strabismus is a misalignment of the eyes that affects 2-4% of the population; it is often associated with amblyopia. The inward turning gaze commonly referred to as \\"crossed-eyes\\" is an example of strabismus. The term strabismus applies to other types of misalignments, including an upward, downward, or outward turning eye. *Amblyopia (aka lazy eye) occurs when the vision of one eye is significantly better than the other eye, and the brain begins to rely on the better eye and ignore the weaker one. Amblyopia affects 4% of the population and is clinically diagnosed when the refractive error of one eye is more than 1.5 diopters different from the other eye (anisometropia) or one of the eye is misaligned for a long period of time (Strabismus). The management of amblyopia involves correcting of significant refractive errors and using techniques that encourage the brain to pay attention to the weaker eye such as patching the stronger eye (occlusion therapy). *Blocked tear ducts. *Ptosis *Retinopathy of prematurity *Nystagmus *Visual inattention Your Baby's Eyes-Development, Vision Examination and Eye Problems Explained *Pediatric cataracts *Pediatric glaucoma *Abnormal vision development *Genetic disorders often cause eye problems for affected children. Since approximately 30% of genetic syndromes affect the eyes, examination by a pediatric ophthalmologist can help with the diagnosis of genetic conditions. Many pediatric ophthalmologists participate with multi-disciplinary medical teams that treat children with genetic syndromes. *Congenital malformations affecting vision or the tear drainage duct system can be evaluated and possibly surgically corrected by a pediatric ophthalmologist. *Orbital tumours *Refractive errors such as myopia (near- sightedness), hyperopia (far-sightedness) and astigmatism can often be corrected with prescriptions for glasses or contacts. *Accommodative insufficiency *Convergence insufficiency and asthenopia *Evaluation of visual issues in education, including dyslexia and attention deficit disorder. Pediatric ophthalmologists often work in conjunction with orthoptists in the treatment of strabismus. History Frank D. Costenbader was an American physician frequently credited as the world's first pediatric ophthalmologist.Marshall MM. \\"The History of the Costenbader Society: Costenbader's Challenges.\\" March 19, 2000.

Parks trained many pediatric ophthalmologists during his career and was instrumental in the establishment of the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, a national organization dedicated to improving the quality and management of pediatric ocular disease. Over time, over 30 programs were developed for the training of pediatric ophthalmologists throughout the United States. The American Academy of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus works with the American Academy of Pediatrics on issues related to pediatric eye disease and vision screening guidelines.

Longoria (1920 ‚Äì June 1945) was an American soldier from Texas, who served in the United States Army as a private. He died during World War II and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery after veterans supported his cause in a dispute over his funerary arrangements. Background Longoria was killed during the war, in the Philippines in 1945, but his body was not returned to his family until 1949. Upon receiving the body, his family attempted to arrange to bury him at the local cemetery, which was segregated and limited to whites. The only funeral home in town denied wake services since Felix was Mexican American. The G.I. Forum fought against the injustice, and he was eventually buried in Arlington National Cemetery near Washington D.C.Manuel G. Gonzales Mexicanos: A History of Mexicans in the United States (Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1999) p. 183‚Äì184. =Personal= Born and raised in Three Rivers, Texas, Felix Longoria moved to Corpus Christi with his wife in search of work. He was working there as a truck driver and he and his wife had a four-year-old daughter. Feeling the call to service, in November 1944, Longoria enlisted in the US Army. In late April 1945, he shipped out from Fort Ord, California, to the 27th Infantry Regiment of the 25th Infantry Division, then located in Luzon in the Philippines. He arrived on Luzon Island around June 1, 1945. The platoon was ambushed by a hidden Japanese machine gunner within two weeks of landing, and Longoria was among those killed. His remains were not recovered and identified until 1949. Once they were identified, the Army arranged to have them returned to the United States and to his family. =Social climate= In Texas during the 1940s, as in other parts of the country, Mexican Americans were socially considered non-white but they were counted as white on the census. Segregation of Mexican American children in schools and employment discrimination against Mexican American workers was pervasive in the Southwestern United States. The town of Three Rivers was no exception. The section nearest the river and west of the railroad was setup for Mexican Americans to live in segregation (see referenced map: the streets west of the rail lines have names in Spanish). Generally during World War II, Mexican-American servicemen were integrated into regular military units, but some served in segregated Mexican-American units, such as Company C, 141st Infantry Regiment, 36th Infantry Division of the Texas Army National Guard. Felix Longoria Affair The soldier's widow tried to make arrangements with the director of the funeral home in Three Rivers to hold a wake for Longoria at the funeral home. Tom Kennedy, the funeral home director, would not allow this. He said that because the late soldier was a \\"Mexican,\\" \\"the whites would not like it.\\" He repeated this sentiment in phone conversations with Dr. Hector P. Garcia and reporter, George Groh, of the Corpus Christi Caller. Kennedy was willing to set up a wake at the Longoria home, in the segregated area across the railroad tracks from the white section of town, as was the customary treatment of Mexican Americans by the Three Rivers community. Longoria was to be re-interred in the Longoria Cemetery (purchased by his father in 1925), which abutted the West side of the town's all-white cemetery. This portion of the cemetery, separated by a fence at that time, was reserved by the Three Rivers community for the Mexican Americans. After an investigation into the Longoria Affair, U.S. Senator Lyndon B. Johnson offered to have Private Longoria's remains interred at Arlington National Cemetery. He wanted to end the controversy related to where the wake would be held prior to burial. When the New York Times reported on the local difficulties faced by Longoria's family in Three Rivers, the case attracted national attention and it became known as the Felix Longoria Affair. Walter Winchell on his radio program stated \\"The big state of Texas looks mighty small tonight\\". Outraged Tejanos who sought to end such discrimination, organized under the newly formed American GI Forum and its leader, Dr. Hector P. Garcia. With the incident being reported by national papers, Freshman Senator Lyndon B. Johnson intervened in the case. He gained approval for Longoria's remains to be reinterred in Arlington National Cemetery in a full military ceremony, along with the remains of eighteen other soldiers whose remains had been repatriated from foreign soil where they had served and died. Full military honors were accorded each burial. Texas House of Representatives committee investigation Under mounting national pressure, the State of Texas took action. The Texas House of Representatives appointed a five-person committee to investigate the allegations of racism. The Committee met in the Three Rivers Chamber of Commerce, next to the barber shop that served only whites. The committee conducted open hearings to take testimony, statements, and hear arguments on the issue. In the end, two reports were filed. The majority report found that no racism had occurred. Frank Oltorf, dissenting member, wrote a minority report concluding that the funeral home's actions were discriminatory based on race. The reports and supporting documentation were filed with the Texas House of Representatives. When one of the members removed his name from the majority report, both reports were pulled from the record. Today, the summaries of both reports, without any supporting documentation, are all that survive. Decorations *Purple Heart *Good Conduct Medal *Combat Infantryman Badge Chicano movement What has now become known as the \\"Longoria Affair\\" was a pivotal moment in the early stages of the post-World War II Chicano Movement in the United States. The newly formed GI Forum (est. March 1948) was advocating on behalf of segregated Hispanic veterans receiving unequal treatment by the military in Corpus Christi. Mrs. Longoria and her sister contacted Dr. Hector P. Garcia, founder of the American GI Forum, who began lobbying for improvements. The national and international press picked up the story and the movement even impacted U.S.‚ÄìMexican relations. The Felix Longoria affair became an early example of a unifying event in the Chicano Movement. The intervention of Garc√≠a and the American GI Forum in the matter led to an increased interest around the country in opening local chapters of the organization.Justice for My People: The Dr. Hector P. Garcia Story (2004), documentary aired on PBS, September 17, 2007. Among Mexican Americans and Hispanics across the country, the incident became a rallying point and a recruiting tool for the GI Forum that soon had chapters across the US. Texas Historical Marker In 2004, Santiago Hernandez of Corpus Christi, who was an employee of the federal prison near Three Rivers, began a push for local recognition of Private Felix Longoria in Three Rivers. He proposed to name the city's post office in honor of Longoria. This revived former tensions and longstanding resentments, both among survivors and a new generation, related to the events of 1948‚Äì1949 and discrimination against Hispanics. In this atmosphere the proposal was rejected. Hernandez gained permission from the Tejano owner of the now closed and dilapidated funeral home to place a Texas Historical Marker on the property. The Texas Historical Commission granted permission, over the objections of the local historical commission and the mostly white supporters of Mr. Kennedy to the marker and to the information on it. The subject of local controversy, the marker was installed in the Spring of 2010, and many in the community attended the dedication. In 2014, new owners of the funeral home demolished it and converted the lot into a parking area. The historical marker was damaged in the process; after it was hit by a car soon after, it was removed. The new owners of the property asked that the marker not be returned after it was repaired, so it was rededicated and installed in the town square at the entrance to city hall. The events of 1944 and the placement of the historical marker were covered in a documentary film: the film, The Longoria Affair, and its subjects are still controversial in Three Rivers. The exact words Mr. Kennedy reportedly used and his reasons for denying the use of the funeral home are disputed by some locals in Three Rivers, and the family and friends of Mr. Kennedy.

Biography He was born Moisis Bourlas on May 9, 1918 in Cairo. His parents were both Greek Jews; his father from the city of Volos and his mother from the island of Khios. Moisis was the fourth child of a large family. His parents were forced to return to Greece due to financial problems. The Bourlas family first established in Naousa and then in Thessaloniki. Since his childhood Moisis assisted his father who was employed in a bakery. After finishing high school, he became an apprentice turner (lathe operator). In 1935, Bourlas became a member of OKNE, the Organization of Communist Youths of Greece. When World War II erupted, Bourlas was serving in the Engineers' Arms of the Greek Military in the Greek part of Thrace. As an army bridge constructor, he was transferred to the Albanian front to combat the Italian invasion of 1940-1941, where he fought in the front line. In February 1943, right after the Nazi occupation forces had imposed their \\"racial measures\\" that eventually led to the Holocaust, Bourlas joined the resistance forces of ELAS (Greek National Liberation Army) under the alias \\"Byron\\", and fought in the 30th Regiment on the mountain of Paiko near Kilkis. In the summer of 1945, after the Varkiza agreement that preluded the Greek Civil War, Bourlas was arrested for his political convictions and exiled in the Greek islands of Icaria, Makronisos and Ai Stratis. Thanks to a Greek-Israeli agreement in 1951, Bourlas was released from his exile and immigrated to Israel. He worked there as a turner, while he was actively involved in the Communist Party of Israel and the workers' movement. He stayed in Israel until 1967, when the anti-communism of the Israeli society developed after the Six-Day War forced him and his Russian Jewish wife to flee the country. After a short stay in Bulgaria, Bourlas and his wife went to the Soviet Union, where they established in a town near the Ural mountains. During his stay in the Soviet Union, Bourlas adopted the middle name \\"Michail\\". Bourlas continued to work as a turner until 1982, when he became a pensioner and started his efforts to return to Greece. He established in the city of Sukhumi in the Georgian SSR, where he became a Greek language teacher to the young Greek students of the area. He returned to Greece in August 1990, without any resources or financial aid, where he started a new struggle to survive and regain his Greek citizenship that he had lost when he emigrated to Israel. Bourlas eventually succeeded to regain his citizenship in 1999. In 2000, he published his autobiography \\"Greek, Jew and Left\\" (Greek: ŒàŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒ±œÇ, ŒïŒ≤œÅŒ±ŒØŒøœÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒëœÅŒπœÉœÑŒµœÅœåœÇ) under the name of Moisis Michail Bourlas. During the last years of his life, Moisis Michail Bourlas lived in the Saoul Modiano Home for the Elderly in Thessaloniki. He continued to be actively involved in the Greek left and the city's affairs. In 2002 and again in 2006, he ran as a candidate for the city council of Thessaloniki, in the ticket of \\"Thessaloniki for Citizens and Ecology\\" led by Tasos Kourakis. He died on March 17, 2011. His remains are buried in the Jewish cemetery of Stavroupoli, Thessaloniki. See also *History of Modern Greece References *Bourlas, Moisis Michail (autobiography).

The JACL is the oldest and largest Asian American civil rights organization in the United States, focusing on issues that enhance or threaten the civil and human rights of all Americans, and strategies aimed at effecting positive social change, particularly those impacting the Asian Pacific American community. The organization was formed in 1929 out of existing Nisei organizations in California and Washington, and spread to become the largest and most well- known Japanese American organization in the United States. It did not exist in Hawaii during the years prior to and after World War II where a chapter was finally established in 1980. http://www.jaclhonolulu.org/about/ In its early years, it lobbied for legislation that expanded the citizenship rights of Japanese Americans, and local chapters organized meetings to encourage Nisei to become more politically active. During and leading up to World War II, the JACL was criticized for its decision not to use its political influence to fight the incarceration of Japanese Americans, aiding U.S. intelligence agencies in identifying \\"disloyal\\" Issei, and taking a hardline stance against draft resisters in camp. These issues remain a source of division within the Japanese American community and the organization itself. After the war, the JACL returned its primary focus to civil rights legislation, lobbying Congress and bringing lawsuits to overturn or amend laws regarding interracial marriage, segregation, and race-based restrictions on immigration and naturalization. In the 1970s, after some initial disagreement among leaders,Cherstin Lyon. \\"Japanese American Citizens League,\\" Densho Encyclopedia (accessed February 14, 2014.) the organization became involved in the movement for redress for the wartime incarceration. The influence of JACL lobbyists was a key factor in the passage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988,Leslie T. Hatamiya. Righting a Wrong: Japanese Americans and the Passage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 (Stanford University Press, 1993), 145. which formally acknowledged the unconstitutionality of and provided reparations for the incarceration. A younger generation of JACL leadership has made an effort to acknowledge the consequences of its wartime actions, officially apologizing for its condemnation of Nisei draft resisters in 2002. Today, the national organization consists of 100-plus chapters, mostly located in major cities and metropolitan areas across the country. These chapters are separated geographically into seven district councils, each of which is headed by a district governor. The organization is guided by a board of elected officials, consisting of the officers and district governors. As demographic and political shifts change the face of the Japanese American community, the JACL has expanded its mission to protect the rights of Asian Pacific Americans and people of all ethnic groups, and to focus on issues important to the hapa identities of younger, mixed-race members. The JACL is also a strong supporter of marriage equality, in 1994 becoming the first non-LGBTQ organization after the ACLU to support marriage equality. History =Early years (1929‚Äì1941)= In 1929, several already-established Nisei organizations merged to form the Japanese American Citizens League, most prominent among them Fresno's American Loyalty League (headed by Nisei UC educated dentist, Dr. Thomas T. Yatabe b1897-d1977), the Seattle Progressive Citizens League, and the San Francisco-based New American Citizens League. The nascent JACL held its first national conference in Seattle in 1930JACL. \\"History of the Japanese American Citizens League\\" (accessed February 14, 2014) and soon after began work to expand the citizenship rights of Japanese and Asian Americans, who were considered unassimilable to American society and therefore ineligible for naturalization under the Immigration Act of 1924. Their first target was the Cable Act of 1922, which revoked the citizenship of women who married men ineligible for citizenship, namely Asian immigrants. After a successful lobbying campaign, Congress amended the act in 1931. Next, the JACL began a campaign to allow Issei and other Asian American veterans of the First World War to become U.S. citizens. In 1935, the Nye-Lea Act secured citizenship rights for these men. =World War II internment (1941‚Äì1945)= Within hours of the Imperial Japanese Navy's attack on Pearl Harbor, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began arresting Japanese American community leaders (mostly Issei Japanese language school teachers, priests, martial arts instructors, and business owners).Densho. \\"About the Incarceration: Arrests of Community Leaders\\" (accessed February 14, 2014) Members of the JACL testified at government hearings to promote an image of Nisei as loyal and patriotic Americans, an effort to counteract rumors of fifth column activity that had spread in the wake of Pearl Harbor. At the same time, the JACL aided FBI and Naval Intelligence officials to identify potentially disloyal Issei, a move many Japanese Americans argued effectively bought political safety for a small segment of the community at the expense of its more vulnerable members. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, JACL leadership did not question the constitutionality of the exclusion of Japanese Americans from the West Coast. Instead, arguing it would better serve the community to follow government orders without protest, the organization advised the approximately 120,000 affected to go peacefully and distanced itself from those who actively opposed the order. Throughout the war, the JACL made efforts to ensure some measure of protection and comfort for Japanese Americans resettling outside government concentration camps, providing loans and establishing offices in Chicago to assist families resettling in the Midwest. The organization argued for the right of Japanese Americans to serve in the U.S. military. In Hawaii where at that time the JACL did not exist, many community leaders actively supported for men of Japanese descent to serve in the military resulting in the formation of the 100th Infantry Battalion in June 1942 http://encyclopedia.densho.org/100th%20Infantry%20Battalion/ and then the 442nd RCT in January 1943 when 10,000 signed up with eventually 2,686 being chosen to join the 1,500 from the mainland.http://encyclopedia.densho.org/442nd%20Regimental%20Combat%20Team/ =Civil rights movement (1945‚Äì1970)= Following the war, the JACL began a long series of legislative efforts to win the rights of Japanese Americans. In 1946, the JACL embarked on a hard-fought campaign to repeal California's Alien Land Law, which, enacted in the early years of the 20th century, prohibited all Japanese aliens (i.e. immigrants) from purchasing and owning land in the state, one of the most discriminatory statutes enacted in California against Japanese Americans. In 1948, the JACL helped found the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and, in the same year, succeeded in gaining passage of the Evacuation Claims Act, the first of a series of efforts to rectify the losses and injustices of the World War II internment. In 1949, the JACL initiated efforts in the U.S. Congress to gain the right of Japanese immigrants to become naturalized citizens of the U.S., a right denied to them for over fifty years. The 1951 Walter-McCarren Act, which was essentially a JACL-initiated bill, included language that opened a back door to give women in the United States a foothold on broadening their rights of participation in the democratic process. Among its major accomplishments, the organization committed its lobbying efforts for passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a landmark achievement during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. =Redress for internment (1970‚Äì1994)= In 1970, at its biennial convention in Chicago, the JACL passed a resolution calling for recognition of, and reparations for, the injustice of the internment of Japanese Americans. It formalized the debate as a priority within the organization despite the Japanese American community's tepid response to the issue. In 1978, the JACL launched a campaign to seek redress from the U.S. government for the imprisonment and loss of freedom of Japanese Americans during World War II. The JACL was determined to seek some measure of legislative guarantee that the violation of constitutional rights visited upon Japanese Americans would never again be brought upon any group in the United States. Within two years of launching the campaign, a JACL-sponsored legislation to create a federal investigative commission was approved by the Congress and signed by President Jimmy Carter. The Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians was established to investigate the circumstances surrounding the World War II internment and provide its findings to the Congress and the president. The commission's report in 1982 found that the government's actions were unjustified and unconstitutional, and based on this substantiation of its claims and on the commission's recommendations for monetary redress, the JACL sought legislation calling for monetary redress and a presidential apology. The redress campaign culminated with the signing of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which provided monetary compensation and a formal apology to the victims of the World War II internment. After ten years of campaigning in Washington, D.C. and across the country through its chapters' grassroots efforts, the JACL brought to a close a final episode in one of the darkest chapters in the constitutional history of the nation. =Recent activities (1994‚Äìpresent)= In 1994, at its national convention, the JACL passed a resolution affirming its commitment to and support of the basic human right of marriage, including the right to marry for same-sex couples. The JACL was the first national civil rights membership organization to publicly and actively adopt this position, and it has continued to be in the forefront, advocating rights for same-sex marriage. The JACL has also spoken up and supported various civil rights issues such as immigration reform, military hazing, the indefinite detention clause in the National Defense Authorization Act, and the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1882. Programs =Bridging Communities Program= The Bridging Communities Program brings youth from the Japanese and Asian American community together with Muslim and Arab American youth. The program aims to create unity between communities that have become targets of racial profiling and suspicion. High school students attend workshops on identity, community, organizing, culture, and empowerment. The program culminates with the youth visiting the Tule Lake Relocation Center, Manzanar, and Minidoka National Historic Site concentration camps, which first confined Japanese Americans during World War II. The Bridging Communities program is funded by a grant from the National Park Service. Organizational partners include the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the Tule Lake Pilgrimage Committee, the National Japanese American Historical Society, Nikkei for Civil Rights and Redress, Kizuna, and Friends of Minidoka. =JACL/OCA Leadership Summit= This annual leadership training summit is a joint program organized by the JACL which includes participants from OCA National (formerly the Organization of Chinese Americans), the second largest Asian Pacific American civil rights organizations in the United States. This three-day conference provides an opportunity for thirty emerging leaders of all ages from JACL and OCA National to learn about current national public policy issues facing the Asian American community. Workshop topics range from coalition building techniques to the strategy of successful lobbying. =Youth Leadership Summit= The Youth Leadership Summit was first established in 2010 and has been a crucial part of JACL's youth involvement. The participants are engaged through workshops, discussions, and a tour of San Francisco's Japantown, one of the three remaining historic Japanese neighborhoods in the US. Workshop topics included an introduction to JACL where membership staff presented on the history, structure, and public policy advocacy roles of the JACL, and multiculturalism in the United States. The Youth Leadership Summit has been held annually in Chicago, Portland, and Washington DC. =Collegiate Leadership Conference= Held every year, the Collegiate Leadership Conference was established in 2009 and is patterned after the JACL/OCA Washington, DC Leadership Conference. The conference consists of a three-day program connecting Asian American student leaders from around the country with community leaders and elected officials in Washington DC. Interactive workshops and seminars cover topics ranging from immigration reform to educational policy and includes speakers from the National Education Association, the Anti-Defamation League, and the White House Initiative on AAPIs. is limited to Asian American college students who are in their freshman, sophomore or junior year in school. =Scholarships= The JACL has been helping students achieve their educational dreams with the National Scholarship and Awards Program since 1946. The program currently offers over 30 awards, with an annual total of over $70,000 in scholarships to qualified students nationwide. The National Scholarship and Awards Program offer scholarships to students at the entering freshman, undergraduate, graduate, law, financial need and creative & performing arts. All scholarships are one- time awards. National Convention =History of National Convention= The first JACL National Convention was held on August 29, 1930 in Seattle, Washington. The first post World War II National JACL Convention was held in Denver, Colorado. Adoption of a 14-point program of rebuilding which included Issei naturalization, reparations for discriminatory treatment during the war, re-examination of the constitutionality of the evacuation, stay of deportation on hardship cases involving Japanese nationals, a call for a national conference of minorities, elimination of racial discrimination in housing and employment, challenge of the alien land laws, creation of a research clearinghouse on the evacuation, and assistance of returning Nisei veterans. =1970 National Convention= The 1970 JACL convention was marred by the murder of Evelyn Okubo, an 18-year-old activist and attendee, by a black man. Nevertheless, the JACL continued its commitment to racial justice for all Americans, including African-Americans. =2013 National Convention= The 2013 JACL National Convention was held July 24‚Äì26, 2013 in Washington DC. The theme for the 44th convention is \\"Justice for All\\".

He entered office in 2003 and represented the ten counties of Senate District 2 in the northeastern portion of the state. Deuell was narrowly unseated in the runoff election held on May 27, 2014; he polled 17,930 (49.6 percent) to intraparty challenger Bob Hall's 18,230 (50.4 percent).Leszcynski, Ray. Bob Hall ousts District 2 incumbent Deuell, Dallas Morning News, May 27, 2014. Deuell had led a three-candidate field in the primary on March 4, with 23,847 votes (48.5 percent). Because he fell short of a majority, he was placed in the runoff with the number-two candidate, Bob Hall, who in the primary polled 19,085 votes (38.8 percent). The remaining 6,240 votes (12.7 percent) went to the third candidate, Mark Thompson. Background Deuell, was educated at George Mason University in Fairfax County, Virginia, and the Medical College of Virginia. He is a partner in Primary Care Associates in Greenville, Texas. He is a member of the American Medical Association and Texas Medical Association. He is certified by the American Board of Family Medicine. Deuell and his wife, Marilyn, reside in Greenville in Hunt County. They have three children, Paul, Brian, and Jennifer.  Legislative history  During the Seventy-ninth Texas Legislature (2005), Deuell passed legislation to help ensure firefighters and other first responders who contract diseases in the line of duty receive the benefits they deserve (Senate Bill 310), created a statewide stroke emergency plan with the Texas Stroke Act (Senate Bill 330), authorized a medical dispatch program for rural areas (Senate Bill 523) and set up a Medicaid buy-in program for the working disabled (Senate Bill 565). Deuell also worked to ensure passage of bills dealing with issues such as education, transportation, lawsuit reform and family issues. In the Eightieth Texas Legislature Senator Deuell was tapped by Lt. Governor David Dewhurst to carry Jessica's Law legislation, aimed at protecting society's most vulnerable population from child predators. Governor Rick Perry signed this bill into law on July 17, 2007. Deuell also worked to advance issues as diverse as Medicaid reform and incentives programs to attract film and television production to Texas. For his work in this Session, Deuell was named as one of Texas Monthly's Best Legislators. In 2013, Deuell co-authored legislation that would require abortion providers to abide by the same regulations as ambulatory surgical centers. Critics characterized the bill as a TRAP law that would enact a \\"virtual ban on abortion in Texas.\\" During the 83rd Legislative Session, which was his first as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Economic Development, Deuell worked for passage of several bills to help ensure the Texas economy continues to lead the nation. Key measures include: Renewal of the Texas Economic Development Act (SB 1647 by Sen. Deuell / HB 3390 by Representative Harvey Hilderbran) - this successful state program has brought over $60 billion in capital investment, over 6,500 jobs, and almost $600 million in direct payments to school districts since 2001. In renewing the act, Deuell added strong taxpayer protections such as an annual ongoing audit and monetary penalties for failure to meet job-creation requirements (any penalties collected will go to Foundation School Fund). Research and Development Incentives (SB 859 by Sen. Deuell / HB 800 by Rep. Murphy) - A study by Texans for Innovation indicates that this legislation could result in $13 billion in increased economic activity, $4.5 billion in increased wages and income, and 97,000 new permanent jobs.

Its raison d'etre was dissatisfaction by some lesbians and gay men with the alleged center-left or liberal orthodoxy of the lesbian and gay rights movement in the United States. It was founded around 1998 and dissolved in 2010, believing its mission had been largely accomplished. Its blog, by Stephen H. Miller, continues at the website IGFCultureWatch, which also hosts the Forum's article archives. Rise of the new 'gay right' movement In 1993, Bruce Bawer published his book A Place At The Table that criticized homophobic social conservatives and U.S. Democratic Party-aligned and center-left lesbians and gay men in the United States. He argued that this political bias produced an unworkable and partisan bias which locked lesbian and gay voters into endorsement of one partisan choice, instead of bipartisan political initiatives that focused on both the Democrat and Republican Parties, as well as questioning the relevance and importance of some broad center-left goals and objectives to lesbian and gay communities in the United States. Bawer called for full inclusion of gays in mainstream society and criticized what he considered an unrepresentative but highly visible gay subculture that equated homosexuality with promiscuity, hedonism, political correctness or stereotypes like being effeminate or \\"different\\" in general. In 1995, Andrew Sullivan published the book Virtually Normal. Sullivan was a longtime critic of decadence in the gay community, but the book also did something that Bawer did not do. Sullivan criticized what he called the prohibitionist, liberationist, liberal, and conservative approaches to gay rights in favor of a more \\"classical liberal\\" or libertarian approach. In 1996, Bawer edited a collection of writings by mostly gay men and women titled Beyond Queer: Challenging Gay Left Orthodoxy. The authors--including Sullivan, Jonathan Rauch, Stephen H. Miller, Paul Varnell, and Norah Vincent-- covered a wide range of topics and did not have one political message. Some authors were critical of how the gay rights movement was trying to achieve its goals, some were critical of certain goals such as hate crime laws, and others were critical of both the ends and the means. These books became labeled in leftist gay circles as the manifesto of a new \\"Gay Right\\" though many of the authors in these books would dispute being labeled conservative. Some had libertarian political sympathies. The Independent Gay Forum became a significant online site for U.S. lesbian and gay authors that endorsed limited-government conservative or libertarian alternatives to what they saw as the 'impractical' center-left bias that 'characterizes' lesbian and gay identity and politics. Additional writers include philosopher John Corvino, activist Richard Rosendall and columnist Jennifer Vanasco. The website included hundreds of articles on a wide range of political and cultural topics -- marriage, sex, religion, economics, law, politics, activism, books, and gay identity. It also included \\"IGF Culture Watch\\", a blog authored by Miller. Criticism of the IGF =Liberal criticism= Critics of the Independent Gay Forum's writings tend to be drawn between a division between liberals and conservatives and a second division between conservatives and libertarians. The Independent Gay Forum mission statement is to forge a new \\"gay mainstream\\" that is committed to more conservative-libertarian values; i.e., limited government, free market capitalism and personal responsibility. Liberal critics felt that the Independent Gay Forum was too closely aligned with the Republican Party, to be called \\"Independent\\", and that its writers demonstrated too little respect for cultural diversity, social justice and social responsibility. IGF writers would often endorse conservative Republican theories about the harm that gun control legislation would pose to lesbian and gay handgun owners, arguing that such controls infringe constitutional rights under the Second Amendment, welfare 'reform', Social Security privatization, abortion, and the neo-conservative theory about initiating military action in order to promote a freedom and democracy in certain nations such as Iran and Iraq. In another was when Miller supported Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger's successful bid to become governor of California, praising his socially liberal, fiscally conservative philosophy. Liberal critics pointed out that Miller was much less supportive of Vermont Governor Howard Dean's bid for governor who ran on a similar neoliberal philosophy. In another case, gay liberals also argued that the articles about the late, former U.S. President Ronald Reagan were too partisan and tried to rewrite the Reagan Administration's policies on AIDS and gay rights. =Libertarian criticism= Libertarians criticism of the IGF tends to be tied to a belief that the writers do not go far enough in advocating for reducing government regulations that limit citizens personal and economic life. Yet, a second source of criticism, among libertarians is that the IGF writers do not advocate election law reforms that would allow the Libertarian Party to freely compete for votes in elections. When Miller defended the work of gay Republicans by using an analogy of the benefits to the consumer that occur when there is more than one grocery store in a town. The message was that gay voters, like consumers, would get a better deal with more competition for their support. This angered many Libertarians as the 'grocery store analogy' ignored the fact that government regulations as ballot access law make it hard for a third political party such as the Libertarian Party to compete for the support of gay citizens because they have to spend limited resources in order to obtain access on the general election ballot with a party affiliation. Thus some libertarians felt that Miller should have been a better advocate for greater voter choice. Topics Aside from Miller, other writers have contributed to the Independent Gay Forum and have written numerous articles about current events such as gay marriage, civil unions, the Marriage Protection Amendment, transgender rights, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, hate crime or hate speech bans, the religious right, the military gay ban, Social Security, the War in Iraq, and the Second Amendment.

A Republican, served in the Texas Senate from 2004 through 2017. He was sworn in on March 5, 2004, after winning a special election to represent District 1. He declined to seek re-election in 2016 and was succeeded in office by fellow Republican Bryan Hughes. Early life and education Eltife was born in Tyler, Texas, and grew up there. He is a Lebanese American; all of his grandparents immigrated to the United States from Lebanon.Aman Batheja, A G.O.P. Senator Who Is Unafraid to Suggest Raising Taxes, Texas Tribune/New York Times (March 14, 2013). His father died when Eltife was under two years old. Business and political career Eltife is the owner and operator of Eltife Properties, a commercial real estate company. Eltife first entered politics in 1991, when he ran for a city council seat. He subsequently served as mayor of Tyler for two terms (six years). Eltife defeated Paul Sadler in the special election for Texas Senate; in 2012, Sadler was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee against Ted Cruz for one of the two Texas seats in the United States Senate. The position opened when state Senator and former Lieutenant Governor Bill Ratliff of Mount Pleasant resigned with less than a year remaining in his state Senate term. Eltife was a strong proponent of raising sales taxes and reducing property taxes. Eltife wishes to use additional sales tax revenue to reduce the debt of the Texas Department of Transportation. Eltife was considered one of the most liberal of the nineteen (as of 2013) Texas Senate Republicans, along with Robert L. Duncan of Lubbock, Kel Seliger of Amarillo, Bob Deuell of Greenville, and John Carona of Dallas, according to an analysis by Mark P. Jones of the political science department at Rice University in Houston. Jones also found that these Republicans saw passage of 90 percent of the bills for which they voted. Of these five senators, Deuell lost a runoff election on May 27, 2014, and Carona was narrowly defeated for re-nomination on March 4. Duncan, meanwhile, resigned from the Senate to become chancellor of the Texas Tech University System. In 2015, Eltife announced that he would not seek reelection to the Senate in 2016. Eltife was succeeded in office by Republican state Representative Bryan Hughes of Mineola, who defeated Republican state Representative David Simpson of Longview in the Republican primary and automatically won the seat because there was no Democratic opponent.Roy Maynard, Bryan Hughes wins Senate District 1 seat, defeating David Simpson, Tyler Morning Telegraph (May 24, 2016).

Classes at a language school are usually geared towards, for example, communicative competence in a foreign language. Language learning in such schools typically supplements formal education or existing knowledge of a foreign language. Students vary widely by age, educational background, work experience. Further, at language school students usually have the possibility of selecting a specific course according to their language proficiency. According to the CEFR. there are six languages levels that define students language proficiency base on their speaking, writing and reading skills. Students will be then assigned to the course that matches their skills.  Structure  As a general rule, new students take a placement test which enables teachers to determine which is the most appropriate level for the student. Courses can be organized in groups or for individuals (one-to-one lessons). Private language schools are generally open year-round and are equipped with pedagogical material (books, tape recorders, videos, language laboratories, a library, etc.) =Organization= Most language schools are private and for-profit. Fees vary depending on a multitude of factors, including local cost of living, exchange rates, and demand for the language in the area where a school is located. Language schools are either independent entities or corporate franchises. =Teachers= Teachers are expected to possess native speaker fluency or acquired competence in their target languages; formal qualifications to become a language teacher, however, vary by school, region or country. This ensures the quality of the language school and provides students with a richer experience. Teachers may have graduated with a B.A, Master's degree or a Ph.D. Pedagogy, experience and strong teaching skills are the principal criteria during the recruitment of the language school's teachers. =Accommodation= Many language schools offer various kinds of accommodation to their students: host family (homestays), campus residences, shared housing, or hotels. Qualifications Most students will sit an international language exam and receive an internationally recognized qualification. =International language exams= Language schools commonly offer specific programs to those wishing to prepare for internationally recognized language exams such as: * TOEIC (English) * TOEFL (English) * CaMLA (English) * TrackTest (English) * University of Toronto TEFL (English) * Cambridge English Language Assessment (English) * DELF/DALF (French) * TestDaF (German) * SIELE (Spanish) * DELE (Spanish) * JLPT (Japanese) * TOPIK (Korean) * HSK (Chinese Mandarin) * DELI/DILI/DALI (Italian) Some organizations combine language study with travel to destinations where the language is natively spoken. This concept of immersion travel makes it easier for students to experience and understand the destination country's culture and language. Language courses =English= Globally, English language schools have seen the greatest demand over schools for other languages. Over one billion people are said to be learning English in a second language or foreign language context. In the United States alone, ESL learners make up over one-third of all adult, non-academic learners. English learning has experienced the highest increase in demand over the last three years, with an increase of 67%. The United States and the UK are the biggest players in the global English travel market accounting for 62% of the total revenue earned in 2013, and account for 65.5% of students worldwide. English language schools are also among the most numerous in Asian countries such as China, Japan and South Korea, as Western culture influences the rising demand for English in business and cultural contexts. =Other European languages= Spanish is the second most popular language in the language travel market, followed with some distance by French, Italian and German. While demand for French, Italian, and German is decreasing, the demand for other languages such as Chinese and Arabic has significantly increased in recent years. Total immersion Spanish language schools have become very popular in Latin America and Spain. Total immersion Italian language schools are popular in Italy. = Chinese = Chinese is one of the largest growing languages among second or foreign language learners, and demand for such classes has typically followed suit. Language schools teaching Mandarin Chinese in the United States and the United Kingdom have increased in number over the last two decades. = Arabic = Arabic has also grown in popularity in the last decade. Reasons include the continued growth of Islam worldwide (the Koran holy book is in Arabic), as well as cultural, economic and political reasons. =Hindi= The Hindi language along with the culture of the Indian subcontinent has started to become important due to recent foreign policies, global competitiveness, and emigration from the country. Hindi began to be introduced as a foreign language in some American schools in the 2000s. Instructors in the language were sought to teach from the kindergarten level right up to the university as part of the National Security Language Initiative. = Russian = Russian has also grown in popularity in the last decade. Reasons include the continued growth of Russian science worldwide, and cultural, economical and political reasons.

It analyzes the village in great detail over a thirty-year period from 1294 to 1324. Then a village of some 250 people, the daily routines of the people are in the records of Jacques Fournier, later Pope Benedict XII. Montaillou was one of the last bastions of Albigensianism, the heresy also known as Catharism. Fournier, then the local bishop, launched an extensive inquisition involving dozens of lengthy interviews with the locals, all of which were faithfully recorded, as well as the arrest of the entire village in 1318 (Le Roy Ladurie has 1308?). When Fournier became Pope he took the records of the investigation with him and they remain in the Vatican Library. The medieval village has been abandoned and the modern village is located a short distance downhill. There are visible remains of houses and there are also old tracks and field markings.

He did not seek reelection in 2014 but instead unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor. Prior to his election in 2006 as agriculture commissioner, Staples had served as a Republican in both houses of the Texas State Legislature and in a nonpartisan position on the city council in Palestine in Anderson County, Texas. Staples was unopposed for renomination in the GOP primary held on March 2, 2010. In the November 2 general election, he handily defeated the populist Democrat Hank Gilbert (born 1959) of Whitehouse and the Libertarian Party choice, Rick Donaldson of Rockwall County. Gilbert had also lost to Staples in 2006. On September 18, 2014, Staples announced that he would resign by mid-November to become president of the Texas Oil & Gas Association, following a controversy surrounding his views on a \\"Meatless Monday\\" campaign being adopted by some Texas schools. Background Staples was reared in Palestine, the seat of government of his native Anderson County in East Texas. He graduated from Palestine High School, where he was an active member of the Future Farmers of America. While in college, he served from 1981 to 1982 as state vice-president of the FFA. He attended Texas A&M; University in College Station and graduated magna cum laude in 1984 with a Bachelor of Science in Agricultural Economics. He started a plant nursery and later became involved in cattle ranching with his family. He also owned a real estate business. For a time, he was an instructor at Trinity Valley Community College in Palestine. Staples has two adult children from his first marriage, which ended in divorce. His son, Jared Cole Staples (born 1987), is an attorney who was worked for the governor's office in Austin, and his daughter, Elizabeth Ann Staples (born 1989) resides in Denver, Colorado. His second wife is the former Janet Wendel (born c. 1953), a daughter of Laura Linder Wendel (1928-2001) and Frank Lee Wendel (1924-2011), a native of Falls County and resident of Madisonville in Madison County, a long-term employee of Lone Star Gas Company, and a decorated soldier in World War II. From her first marriage to Terry Maurice Thorn (born 1951) of Palestine, Janet Staples has two sons, Brian Walker Thorn (born 1979) and Jonathan Clarke Thorn (born 1982). These are Todd Staples' stepsons. Staples is a Southern Baptist deacon in his local church. Political career Staples served on the non-partisan Palestine City Council from 1989 to 1991. In February 1995, he was elected to the Texas House of Representatives District 11 seat in a special election to replace Elton Bomer, who had been appointed state insurance commissioner by newly elected Governor George W. Bush. In a contest against two Democrats, Staples avoided a runoff by about sixty votes, having collected 50.6 percent of the vote. In 2000, Staples entered the race for the District 3 seat in the Texas Senate, vacated by Drew Nixon. Despite personal scandal surrounding Nixon, Staples held the seat for the Republican Party, having received more than 60 percent of the vote in the general election. He represented Anderson, Angelina, Cherokee, Hardin, Henderson, Jasper, Nacogdoches, Newton, Polk, Sabine, San Augustine, San Jacinto, Shelby and Tyler counties, and portions of Montgomery and Smith counties. In the Senate, Staples was the chairman of the Transportation & Homeland Security Committee, the Workers Compensation Select Interim Committee and the Texas Senate Republican Caucus. Staples sponsored and helped to pass a state constitutional amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman. He was the vice-chair of the State Affairs Committee and the Veteran Affairs & Military Installations Committee. Staples was unopposed for the Republican nomination for Agriculture Commissioner in 2006 when the incumbent Susan Combs instead was elected Texas Comptroller to succeed Carole Strayhorn. Staples defeated Democrat Hank Gilbert and Libertarian Clay Woolam in the November 7, 2006, general election. He received 2,307,406 votes (54.77 percent), a margin of 547,000 votes over Gilbert. In 2010, Staples ran for re-election as Agriculture Commissioner and won with more than 60 percent of the votes, again against Democrat Hank Gilbert. On June 5, 2013, Staples addressed the 25th annual conference of the North American Agricultural Biotechnology Council held in College Station. In the keynote address Staples said that the American public has little understanding of what is physically required to produce the needed food and fiber because shelves in grocery stores are always full. He claimed that many fail to understand the importance of agriculture to Texas, which has the largest population of rural citizens in the nation and leads in the production of both beef and cotton. Such misunderstanding, he added, can during times of drought lead to conflict between municipalities and agricultural producers over the available water resources. While water usage declined by 40 percent between 1974 and 2010, the output of cattle, cotton, and corn has doubled since 1960, he noted. Staples explained that in his role as commissioner he is compelled to tell the story of agricultural success: \\"It's up to us to engage with consumers because we know there are those who do not appreciate the work that's being done and what that means for available and affordable food supply.\\" On September 18, Staples announced his resignation to become the president of the Texas Oil & Gas Association. 2014 primary for lieutenant governor Though Staples enlisted baseball great Nolan Ryan as his campaign chairman, he finished third in the primary for lieutenant governor with 235,981 votes (17.8 percent). Voters set forth a runoff for the position between the three-term incumbent David Dewhurst of Houston, who trailed the top votegetter, State Senator Dan Patrick, also of Houston. In fourth place was the outgoing commissioner of the Texas General Land Office, Jerry E. Patterson, a former state senator who had also run against Dewhurst for land commissioner in the 1998 Republican primary; Dewhurst won that round, but Patterson succeeded Dewhurst as land commissioner in 2002, when Dewhurst was first elected lieutenant governor. At a gathering in College Station in January 2014, Staples cited his experience at both the municipal and state levels of government and his support for the Texas constitutional amendment to define marriage as between one man and one woman. Staples said that most politicians \\"are not listening to the people of this country. That's the reason our nation has gone a different direction and left our values and left where we are.\\" Major League Baseball great Nolan Ryan worked in the Staples campaign. Staples said that had he been elected lieutenant governor, he would not have compromised his conservative views. He claimed on the anniversary of the War on Poverty, launched by another Texan, Lyndon B. Johnson, that the program has created \\"a sense of entitlement that should frighten each of us because that's not what the American dream is all about.\\" Staples outlined a six-point plan to reform Texas immigration, with an emphasis on border security but no amnesty. Staples said that as agriculture commissioner he has found funding to place cameras connected to cellphones at strategic locations along the border. This action undertaken from 2012 to 2014, he said, netted some 21,000 illegal aliens and 47 tons of narcotics. Left in the runoff to succeed Staples as the Republican nominee for agriculture commissioner were former State Representatives Sid Miller of Stephenville and Tommy Merritt of Longview, who finished first and second, respectively, in the March 4 primary.

History As a result of the 1995 sarin gas attack on a Tokyo subway and the growing concern about a terrorist chemical attack, the U.S. Congress passed laws to implement a program to train civilian agencies on responding to incidents involving Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). In response, the U.S. Army Reserve Command's Homeland Defense Office, then under the direction of LTC Jon M. Byrom, US Army Reserve developed an annual exercise to integrate collective training with specialized HAZMAT protection and decontamination equipment for Army Reserve units with this homeland defense mission. This annual exercise began in 2004 when the 472d Chemical Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Scott S. Haraburda, was selected to provide operational command and control over nearly 400 Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and high- yield Explosives (CBRNE) defense soldiers. The following year, the exercise doubled in size to 800. In 2006, the 464th Chemical Brigade commanded this exercise, again under newly promoted Colonel Haraburda as the brigade commander, commanding over 1,100 chemical, military police, and medical soldiers, laying the groundwork for future training efforts with non-military organizations as part of the Defense Support of Civil Authorities for large-scale chemical defense missions. This exercise eventually grew to over 3,000 soldiers with ten civilian hospitals in 2009 and to include foreign contributions with Canadian soldiers in 2014.

The operation was led by the Belgian Paracommando Regiment to rescue hostages held by Simba rebels in the town of Stanleyville.  Background  By 1964, the L√©opoldville government, supported by Western powers, was gaining a foothold in its fight to suppress the communist-backed Simba rebellion. Fearing an inevitable defeat, the rebels resorted to taking hostages of the local white population in areas under their control. On 28 October the Simba rebels arrested all Belgians and Americans in Stanleyville. Several hundred hostages were taken to Stanleyville and placed under guard in the Victoria Hotel. The L√©opoldville government turned to Belgium and the United States for help. In response, the Belgian army sent a task force to L√©opoldville, airlifted by the U.S. 322nd Air Division. Washington and Brussels worked jointly on a rescue plan. Several ideas were considered and discarded, and all attempts at negotiating with the Simbas had failed.  Operation  The Belgian task force was led by Colonel Charles Laurent. On the early morning of 24 November 1964, five American C-130 Hercules planes dropped 320 Belgian paratroopers of the Paracommando Regiment onto the airfield at Stanleyville. Once the paratroopers had secured the airfield and cleared the runway they made their way to the Victoria Hotel, prevented Simbas from killing most of the 60 hostages, and evacuated them via the airfield. At 7:00 hrs, the hostages at Residence Victoria were rounded up by the Simba guards and ordered into the street. Around 50 of them had barricaded themselves in their rooms, after having heard the order on Radio Stanleyville at 6:30 to kill all foreigners, but most obediently moved into the street, as they were heading for the airfield. After a short march, when the Simba rebels got word that the airport of Stanleyville was now under Belgian control, the hostages were ordered to sit down in the street. After a few minutes, when heavy firing was heard nearby, some of the Simbas opened fire on the seated Belgians and Americans. The Paracommandos intervened and stabilized the situation by killing and/or driving away the Simbas; of the 250 hostages gathered by the rebels, 18 were already dead, and 40 were heavily wounded. Dr. Paul Carlson, an American medical missionary, was among those killed during the raid. Around 1,600 foreign nationals and 150 Congolese civilians were evacuated. In addition to the direct victims during the raid, several others were killed as a reaction to the arrival of the Belgian troops. Among these victims were many Missionaries, such as the Dox brothers. By mid-December, about one month after Operation Dragon Rouge, a total of 185 foreign hostages left behind in various Simba controlled areas of the Congo, along with a few thousand Congolese civilians, had been executed by the Simba rebels. { - style=\\"vertical- align:top;\\"  Aircraft at Kamina airfield prior to Stanleyville flight  One of the hostages being evacuated by plane  Belgian paratroopers on Stanleyville airfield after the operation }  Aftermath  The operation coincided with the arrival of Arm√©e nationale congolaise (ANC) and other foreign mercenary units‚Äîwhich likely included the hastily-formed 5th Mechanised Brigade and Mike Hoare's 5 Commando ANC‚Äîat Stanleyville which was quickly captured. Because of growing international pressure, Belgium and the U.S. decided to abandon plans for follow-on operations in Bunia and Watsa, a final rescue operation, Operation Dragon Noir, was carried out in Paulis on 26 November. It took the central government until the end of the year to completely put down the remaining areas of the Simba rebellion.

It has a population of about 2,500. It is situated at an altitude of above sea level in the eponymous St. Joachim's valley in the Ore Mountains, close to the Czech border with Germany. The historical core of the town from the sixteenth century is today a urban monument zone. It is a comprehensive set of Gothic ‚Äì Renaissance patrician houses.

The Svornost mine (1525) is the oldest mine still in use in Europe, it is also the first and for a long time the only mine in the world where radium was mined. History Silver mining in Joachimsthal (1548; now J√°chymov) The Svornost mine (1525) is the oldest mine still in use in Europe J√°chymov, Republic Square At the beginning of the 16th century, silver was found in the area of Joachimsthal. The village of Joachimsthal was founded in 1516 in place of the former abandoned village of Konradsgrun in order to facilitate the exploitation of this valuable resource. Stefan Schlick was the founder of J√°chymov. The silver caused the population to grow rapidly, and made the counts Schlick, whose possessions included the town, one of the richest noble Bohemian families. The Schlicks had coins minted, which were called Joachimsthalers. They gave their name to the Thaler and the dollar. The fame of Joachimsthal for its ore mining and smelting works attracted the scientific attention of the doctor Georg Bauer (better known by the Latin form of his name, Georgius Agricola) in the late 1520s, who based his pioneering metallurgical studies on his observations made here. In 1523, the Protestant Reformation began. In the Schmalkaldic War (1546‚Äì47) Joachimsthal was occupied for a time by Saxon troops. When in 1621 the Counter-reformation and re-Catholicisation took effect in the town, many Protestant citizens and people from the mountains migrated to nearby Saxony.More about history of the town in the 16th and 17th centuries for example in the article of Luk√°≈° M. Vytlaƒçil: P≈ô√≠bƒõh renesanƒçn√≠ho J√°chymova [The Story of renaissance J√°chymov]. Evagelicus 2017, Praha 2016. pp. 42-45. (on-line here) Until 1918, the town (named Joachimsthal before 1898) was in the Austrian part of the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary, head of the district with the same name, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Bohemia.Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den √∂sterreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm Klein, 1967 In the 19th century the town was also the location of a Court, and of an administrative office responsible for mines and iron production. Mining was still significant in this period. It was run partly by state-owned and partly by privately owned firms. In addition to silver ore (of which in 1885 227 zentners (11.35 tonnes) were produced), nickel, bismuth and uranium ore were also extracted. There were also other industries: an enormous tobacco factory employed 1,000 women. In addition, there was the manufacture of gloves and corks and of bobbin lace. On 31 March 1873 the town almost entirely burnt down. At the end of the 19th century, Marie Curie discovered, in tons of pitchblende ore containing uraninite from Joachimsthal, the element radium, for which she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Until World War I this was the foremost source of radium in the world. The first radon spa in the world was founded in Joachimsthal in 1906, joining the famous spas of the region, including Karlsbad, Franzensbad, and Marienbad. In 1929, Dr L√∂wy of Prague established that \\"mysterious emanations\\" in the mine led to a form of cancer. Ventilation and watering measures were introduced, miners were given higher pay and longer vacations, but death rates remained high. Following the Munich Agreement in 1938, it was annexed by Nazi Germany as part of the so-called Sudetenland. Most of the German-speaking population was expelled in 1945‚Äì1946 (see the Potsdam Agreement) and replaced by mostly non-German-speaking settlers from other parts of the country. Mining in uranium mines took place here between 1939‚Äì1964, for nuclear projects of Nazis and Communists. In times of Nazism and Communism were large prison camps established in the town and around it. Soviet prisoners of war first worked here, and after 1948 political and other prisoners. Opponents of the new regime were forced to mine uranium ore under very harsh conditions: the average life expectancy in J√°chymov at this period was 42 years. Uranium mining ceased in 1964. The mines today (with the exception of Svornost) are no longer in operation and, for example, in the Eduard mine complex there is now a sports complex with a biathlon shooting range. The radioactive thermal springs which arise in the Svornost mine are used under the supervision of doctors for the treatment of patients with nervous and rheumatic disorders. They make use of the constantly produced radioactive gas radon (222Rn) dissolved in the water, see Radon therapy. Spa Aquacentrum Agricola Radium Palace In the town are some of the most unique spas in the world. Musculoskeletal system is treated here with radon water and direct irradiation. This treatment is suitable for vascular diseases. Furthermore, for the nerve, rheumatic diseases or inflammation of nerves. The most important use is the treatment of diseases of the musculoskeletal system (gout etc.). The spa was founded in 1906. Initially, the water was used for drinking cures, later baths began to be used.

Scuba diving is a mode of underwater diving where the diver uses a self- contained underwater breathing apparatus (scuba), which is completely independent of surface supply, to breathe underwater. Scuba divers carry their own source of breathing gas, usually compressed air, allowing them greater independence and freedom of movement than surface-supplied divers, and longer underwater endurance than breath-hold divers. Although the use of compressed air is common, a mixture of air and oxygen called enriched air or nitrox has become popular due to its benefit of reduced nitrogen intake during long or repetitive dives. Open circuit scuba systems discharge the breathing gas into the environment as it is exhaled, and consist of one or more diving cylinders containing breathing gas at high pressure which is supplied to the diver through a regulator. They may include additional cylinders for range extension, decompression gas or emergency breathing gas. Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather scuba systems allow recycling of exhaled gases. The volume of gas used is reduced compared to that of open circuit, so a smaller cylinder or cylinders may be used for an equivalent dive duration. Rebreathers extend the time spent underwater compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption; they produce fewer bubbles and less noise than open circuit scuba which makes them attractive to covert military divers to avoid detection, scientific divers to avoid disturbing marine animals, and media divers to avoid bubble interference. Scuba diving may be done recreationally or professionally in a number of applications, including scientific, military and public safety roles, but most commercial diving uses surface-supplied diving equipment when this is practicable. Scuba divers engaged in armed forces covert operations may be referred to as frogmen, combat divers or attack swimmers. A scuba diver primarily moves underwater by using fins attached to the feet, but external propulsion can be provided by a diver propulsion vehicle, or a sled pulled from the surface. Other equipment needed for scuba diving includes a mask to improve underwater vision, exposure protection (ie: a wet suit or dry suit), equipment to control buoyancy, a diving regulator to control the pressure of breathing gas for diving, and equipment related to the specific circumstances and purpose of the dive. Some scuba divers use a snorkel when swimming on the surface. Scuba divers are trained in the procedures and skills appropriate to their level of certification by instructors affiliated to the diver certification organisations which issue these certifications. These include standard operating procedures for using the equipment and dealing with the general hazards of the underwater environment, and emergency procedures for self-help and assistance of a similarly equipped diver experiencing problems. A minimum level of fitness and health is required by most training organisations, but a higher level of fitness may be appropriate for some applications. History mass-produced (from 1865 to 1965). In this picture the air reservoir presents its surface-supplied configuration. Henry Fleuss (1851‚Äì1932) improved the rebreather technology. Aqualung scuba set: The history of scuba diving is closely linked with the history of scuba equipment. By the turn of the twentieth century, two basic architectures for underwater breathing apparatus had been pioneered; open-circuit surface supplied equipment where the diver's exhaled gas is vented directly into the water, and closed-circuit breathing apparatus where the diver's carbon dioxide is filtered from unused oxygen, which is then recirculated. Closed circuit equipment was more easily adapted to scuba in the absence of reliable, portable, and economical high pressure gas storage vessels. By the mid twentieth century, high pressure cylinders were available and two systems for scuba had emerged: open-circuit scuba where the diver's exhaled breath is vented directly into the water, and closed- circuit scuba where the carbon dioxide is removed from the diver's exhaled breath which has oxygen added and is recirculated. Oxygen rebreathers are severely depth-limited due to oxygen toxicity risk, which increases with depth, and the available systems for mixed gas rebreathers were fairly bulky and designed for use with diving helmets. The first commercially practical scuba rebreather was designed and built by the diving engineer Henry Fleuss in 1878, while working for Siebe Gorman in London. His self contained breathing apparatus consisted of a rubber mask connected to a breathing bag, with an estimated 50‚Äì60% oxygen supplied from a copper tank and carbon dioxide scrubbed by passing it through a bundle of rope yarn soaked in a solution of caustic potash, the system giving a dive duration of up to about three hours. This apparatus had no way of measuring the gas composition during use. During the 1930s and all through World War II, the British, Italians and Germans developed and extensively used oxygen rebreathers to equip the first frogmen. The British adapted the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus and the Germans adapted the Dr√§ger submarine escape rebreathers, for their frogmen during the war. In the U.S. Major Christian J. Lambertsen invented an underwater free- swimming oxygen rebreather in 1939, which was accepted by the Office of Strategic Services. In 1952 he patented a modification of his apparatus, this time named SCUBA (an acronym for \\"self-contained underwater breathing apparatus\\"), which became the generic English word for autonomous breathing equipment for diving, and later for the activity using the equipment. After World War II, military frogmen continued to use rebreathers since they do not make bubbles which would give away the presence of the divers. The high percentage of oxygen used by these early rebreather systems limited the depth at which they could be used due to the risk of convulsions caused by acute oxygen toxicity. Although a working demand regulator system had been invented in 1864 by Auguste Denayrouze and Beno√Æt Rouquayrol, the first open-circuit scuba system developed in 1925 by Yves Le Prieur in France was a manually adjusted free-flow system with a low endurance, which limited its practical usefulness. In 1942, during the German occupation of France, Jacques-Yves Cousteau and √âmile Gagnan designed the first successful and safe open-circuit scuba, known as the Aqua-Lung. Their system combined an improved demand regulator with high-pressure air tanks. This was patented in 1945. To sell his regulator in English-speaking countries Cousteau registered the Aqua-Lung trademark, which was first licensed to the U.S. Divers company, and in 1948 to Siebe Gorman of England. Siebe Gorman was allowed to sell in Commonwealth countries, but had difficulty in meeting the demand and the U.S. patent prevented others from making the product. The patent was circumvented by Ted Eldred of Melbourne, Australia, who developed the single-hose open-circuit scuba system, which separates the first stage and demand valve of the pressure regulator by a low-pressure hose, puts the demand valve at the diver's mouth, and releases exhaled gas through the demand valve casing. Eldred sold the first Porpoise Model CA single hose scuba early in 1952. Early scuba sets were usually provided with a plain harness of shoulder straps and waist belt. The waist belt buckles were usually quick-release, and shoulder straps sometimes had adjustable or quick release buckles. Many harnesses did not have a backplate, and the cylinders rested directly against the diver's back. Early scuba divers dived without a buoyancy aid.In The Silent World, a film shot in 1955, before the invention of buoyancy control devices, Cousteau and his divers are continuously using their fins to maintain depth. In an emergency they had to jettison their weights. In the 1960s adjustable buoyancy life jackets (ABLJ) became available, which can be used to compensate for loss of buoyancy at depth due to compression of the neoprene wetsuit and as a lifejacket that will hold an unconscious diver face-upwards at the surface, and that can be quickly inflated. The first versions were inflated from a small disposable carbon dioxide cylinder, later with a small direct coupled air cylinder. A low-pressure feed from the regulator first-stage to an inflation/deflation valve unit an oral inflation valve and a dump valve lets the volume of the ABLJ be controlled as a buoyancy aid. In 1971 the stabilizer jacket was introduced by ScubaPro. This class of buoyancy aid is known as a buoyancy control device or buoyancy compensator. Sidemount diver pushing a cylinder in front A backplate and wing is an alternative configuration of scuba harness with a buoyancy compensation bladder known as a \\"wing\\" mounted behind the diver, sandwiched between the backplate and the cylinder or cylinders. Unlike stabilizer jackets, the backplate and wing is a modular system, in that it consists of separable components. This arrangement became popular with cave divers making long or deep dives, who needed to carry several extra cylinders, as it clears the front and sides of the diver for other equipment to be attached in the region where it is easily accessible. This additional equipment is usually suspended from the harness or carried in pockets on the exposure suit. Sidemount is a scuba diving equipment configuration which has basic scuba sets, each comprising a single cylinder with a dedicated regulator and pressure gauge, mounted alongside the diver, clipped to the harness below the shoulders and along the hips, instead of on the back of the diver. It originated as a configuration for advanced cave diving, as it facilitates penetration of tight sections of caves, since sets can be easily removed and remounted when necessary. The configuration allows easy access to cylinder valves, and provides easy and reliable gas redundancy. These benefits for operating in confined spaces were also recognized by divers who made wreck diving penetrations. Sidemount diving has grown in popularity within the technical diving community for general decompression diving, and has become a popular specialty for recreational diving. In the 1950s the United States Navy (USN) documented enriched oxygen gas procedures for military use of what is today called nitrox, and in 1970, Morgan Wells of NOAA began instituting diving procedures for oxygen-enriched air. In 1979 NOAA published procedures for the scientific use of nitrox in the NOAA Diving Manual. In 1985 IAND (International Association of Nitrox Divers) began teaching nitrox use for recreational diving. This was considered dangerous by some, and met with heavy skepticism by the diving community. Nevertheless, in 1992 NAUI became the first existing major recreational diver training agency to sanction nitrox, and eventually, in 1996, the Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) announced full educational support for nitrox. The use of a single nitrox mixture has become part of recreational diving, and multiple gas mixtures are common in technical diving to reduce overall decompression time. Technical diving is recreational scuba diving that exceeds the generally accepted recreational limits, and may expose the diver to hazards beyond those normally associated with recreational diving, and to greater risks of serious injury or death. These risks may be reduced by appropriate skills, knowledge and experience, and by using suitable equipment and procedures. The concept and term are both relatively recent advents, although divers had already been engaging in what is now commonly referred to as technical diving for decades. One reasonably widely held definition is that any dive in which at some point of the planned profile it is not physically possible or physiologically acceptable to make a direct and uninterrupted vertical ascent to surface air is a technical dive. The equipment often involves breathing gases other than air or standard nitrox mixtures, multiple gas sources, and different equipment configurations. Over time, some equipment and techniques developed for technical diving have become more widely accepted for recreational diving. Rebreather diver returning from a dive Nitrogen narcosis limits the depth reachable by underwater divers when breathing nitrox mixtures. In 1924 the US Navy started to investigate the possibility of using helium and after animal experiments, human subjects breathing heliox 20/80 (20% oxygen, 80% helium) were successfully decompressed from deep dives, In 1963 saturation dives using trimix were made during Project Genesis, and in 1979 a research team at the Duke University Medical Center Hyperbaric Laboratory started work which identified the use of trimix to prevent the symptoms of high-pressure nervous syndrome. Cave divers started using trimix to allow deeper dives and it was used extensively in the 1987 Wakulla Springs Project and spread to the north-east American wreck diving community. The challenges of deeper dives and longer penetrations and the large amounts of breathing gas necessary for these dive profiles and ready availability of oxygen sensing cells beginning in the late 1980s led to a resurgence of interest in rebreather diving. By accurately measuring the partial pressure of oxygen, it became possible to maintain and accurately monitor a breathable gas mixture in the loop at any depth. In the mid 1990s semi-closed circuit rebreathers became available for the recreational scuba market, followed by closed circuit rebreathers around the turn of the millennium. Rebreathers are currently manufactured for the military, technical and recreational scuba markets, but remain less popular, less reliable, and more expensive than open circuit equipment. Equipment =Breathing apparatus= Recreational diver putting on his scuba set before diving The defining equipment used by a scuba diver is the eponymous scuba, the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus which allows the diver to breathe while diving, and is transported by the diver. As one descends, in addition to the normal atmospheric pressure at the surface, the water exerts increasing hydrostatic pressure of approximately 1 bar (14.7 pounds per square inch) for every 10 m (33 feet) of depth. The pressure of the inhaled breath must balance the surrounding or ambient pressure to allow inflation of the lungs. It becomes virtually impossible to breathe air at normal atmospheric pressure through a tube below three feet under the water. Most recreational scuba diving is done using a half mask which covers the diver's eyes and nose, and a mouthpiece to supply the breathing gas from the demand valve or rebreather. Inhaling from a regulator's mouthpiece becomes second nature very quickly. The other common arrangement is a full face mask which covers the eyes, nose and mouth, and often allows the diver to breathe through the nose. Professional scuba divers are more likely to use full face masks, which protect the diver's airway if the diver loses consciousness. Open-circuit Aqualung Legend second stage (demand valve) regulator Aqualung first stage regulator Gekko dive computer with attached pressure gauge and compass Suunto submersible pressure gauge display Open circuit scuba has no provision for using the breathing gas more than once for respiration. The gas inhaled from the scuba equipment is exhaled to the environment, or occasionally into another item of equipment for a special purpose, usually to increase buoyancy of a lifting device such as a buoyancy compensator, inflatable surface marker buoy or small lifting bag. The breathing gas is generally provided from a high-pressure diving cylinder through a scuba regulator. By always providing the appropriate breathing gas at ambient pressure, demand valve regulators ensure the diver can inhale and exhale naturally and without excessive effort, regardless of depth, as and when needed. The most commonly used scuba set uses a \\"single-hose\\" open circuit 2-stage demand regulator, connected to a single back-mounted high- pressure gas cylinder, with the first stage connected to the cylinder valve and the second stage at the mouthpiece. This arrangement differs from √âmile Gagnan's and Jacques Cousteau's original 1942 \\"twin-hose\\" design, known as the Aqua-lung, in which the cylinder pressure was reduced to ambient pressure in one or two stages which were all in the housing mounted to the cylinder valve or manifold. The \\"single-hose\\" system has significant advantages over the original system for most applications. In the \\"single-hose\\" two-stage design, the first stage regulator reduces the cylinder pressure of up to about to an intermediate pressure (IP) of about above ambient pressure. The second stage demand valve regulator, supplied by a low-pressure hose from the first stage, delivers the breathing gas at ambient pressure to the diver's mouth. The exhaled gases are exhausted directly to the environment as waste through a non-return valve on the second stage housing. The first stage typically has at least one outlet port delivering gas at full tank pressure which is connected to the diver's submersible pressure gauge or dive computer, to show how much breathing gas remains in the cylinder. Rebreather An Inspiration electronic fully closed circuit rebreather Less common are closed circuit (CCR) and semi-closed (SCR) rebreathers which, unlike open-circuit sets that vent off all exhaled gases, process all or part of each exhaled breath for re- use by removing the carbon dioxide and replacing the oxygen used by the diver. Rebreathers release few or no gas bubbles into the water, and use much less stored gas volume, for an equivalent depth and time because exhaled oxygen is recovered; this has advantages for research, military, photography, and other applications. Rebreathers are more complex and more expensive than open- circuit scuba, and special training and correct maintenance are required for them to be safely used, due to the larger variety of potential failure modes. In a closed-circuit rebreather the oxygen partial pressure in the rebreather is controlled, so it can be maintained at a safe continuous maximum, which reduces the inert gas (nitrogen and/or helium) partial pressure in the breathing loop. Minimising the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues for a given dive profile reduces the decompression obligation. This requires continuous monitoring of actual partial pressures with time and for maximum effectiveness requires real-time computer processing by the diver's decompression computer. Decompression can be much reduced compared to fixed ratio gas mixes used in other scuba systems and, as a result, divers can stay down longer or require less time to decompress. A semi-closed circuit rebreather injects a constant mass flow of a fixed breathing gas mixture into the breathing loop, or replaces a specific percentage of the respired volume, so the partial pressure of oxygen at any time during the dive depends on the diver's oxygen consumption and/or breathing rate. Planning decompression requirements requires a more conservative approach for a SCR than for a CCR, but decompression computers with a real time oxygen partial pressure input can optimise decompression for these systems. Because rebreathers produce very few bubbles, they do not disturb marine life or make a diver's presence known at the surface; this is useful for underwater photography, and for covert work. Gas mixtures A cylinder decal to indicate that the contents are a Nitrox mixture Nitrox cylinder marked up for use showing maximum safe operating depth (MOD) For some diving, gas mixtures other than normal atmospheric air (21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen, 1% trace gases) can be used, so long as the diver is competent in their use. The most commonly used mixture is nitrox, also referred to as Enriched Air Nitrox (EAN), which is air with extra oxygen, often with 32% or 36% oxygen, and thus less nitrogen, reducing the risk of decompression sickness or allowing longer exposure to the same pressure for equal risk. The reduced nitrogen may also allow for no stops or shorter decompression stop times or a shorter surface interval between dives. A common misconception is that nitrox can reduce narcosis, but research has shown that oxygen is also narcotic. The increased partial pressure of oxygen due to the higher oxygen content of nitrox increases the risk of oxygen toxicity, which becomes unacceptable below the maximum operating depth of the mixture. To displace nitrogen without the increased oxygen concentration, other diluent gases can be used, usually helium, when the resultant three gas mixture is called trimix, and when the nitrogen is fully substituted by helium, heliox. For dives requiring long decompression stops, divers may carry cylinders containing different gas mixtures for the various phases of the dive, typically designated as Travel, Bottom, and Decompression gases. These different gas mixtures may be used to extend bottom time, reduce inert gas narcotic effects, and reduce decompression times. =Diver mobility= To take advantage of the freedom of movement afforded by scuba equipment, the diver needs to be mobile underwater. Personal mobility is enhanced by swimfins and optionally diver propulsion vehicles. Fins have a large blade area and use the more powerful leg muscles, so are much more efficient for propulsion and manoeuvering thrust than arm and hand movements, but require skill to provide fine control. Several types of fin are available, some of which may be more suited for manoeuvering, alternative kick styles, speed, endurance, reduced effort or ruggedness. Streamlining dive gear will reduce drag and improve mobility. Balanced trim which allows the diver to align in any desired direction also improves streamlining by presenting the smallest section area to the direction of movement and allowing propulsion thrust to be used more efficiently. Occasionally a diver may be towed using a \\"sled\\", an unpowered device towed behind a surface vessel which conserves the diver's energy and allows more distance to be covered for a given air consumption and bottom time. The depth is usually controlled by the diver by using diving planes or by tilting the whole sled. Some sleds are faired to reduce drag on the diver. =Buoyancy control and trim= Diver under the Salt Pier in Bonaire To dive safely, divers must control their rate of descent and ascent in the water and be able to maintain a constant depth in midwater. Ignoring other forces such as water currents and swimming, the diver's overall buoyancy determines whether they ascend or descend. Equipment such as diving weighting systems, diving suits (wet, dry or semi-dry suits are used depending on the water temperature) and buoyancy compensators can be used to adjust the overall buoyancy. When divers want to remain at constant depth, they try to achieve neutral buoyancy. This minimises the effort of swimming to maintain depth and therefore reduces gas consumption. The buoyancy force on the diver is the weight of the volume of the liquid that they and their equipment displace minus the weight of the diver and their equipment; if the result is positive, that force is upwards. The buoyancy of any object immersed in water is also affected by the density of the water. The density of fresh water is about 3% less than that of ocean water. Therefore, divers who are neutrally buoyant at one dive destination (e.g. a fresh water lake) will predictably be positively or negatively buoyant when using the same equipment at destinations with different water densities (e.g. a tropical coral reef). The removal (\\"ditching\\" or \\"shedding\\") of diver weighting systems can be used to reduce the diver's weight and cause a buoyant ascent in an emergency. Diving suits made of compressible materials decrease in volume as the diver descends, and expand again as the diver ascends, causing buoyancy changes. Diving in different environments also necessitates adjustments in the amount of weight carried to achieve neutral buoyancy. The diver can inject air into dry suits to counteract the compression effect and squeeze. Buoyancy compensators allow easy and fine adjustments in the diver's overall volume and therefore buoyancy. Neutral buoyancy in a diver is an unstable state. It is changed by small differences in ambient pressure caused by a change in depth, and the change has a positive feedback effect. A small descent will increase the pressure, which will compress the gas filled spaces and reduce the total volume of diver and equipment. This will further reduce the buoyancy, and unless counteracted, will result in sinking more rapidly. The equivalent effect applies to a small ascent, which will trigger an increased buoyancy and will result in accelerated ascent unless counteracted. The diver must continuously adjust buoyancy or depth in order to remain neutral. Fine control of buoyancy can be achieved by controlling the average lung volume in open circuit scuba, but this feature is not available to the closed circuit rebreather diver, as exhaled gas remains in the breathing loop. This is a skill which improves with practice until it becomes second nature. Buoyancy changes with depth variation are proportional to the compressible part of the volume of the diver and equipment, and to the proportional change in pressure, which is greater per unit of depth near the surface. Minimising the volume of gas required in the buoyancy compensator will minimise the buoyancy fluctuations with changes in depth. This can be achieved by accurate selection of ballast weight, which should be the minimum to allow neutral buoyancy with depleted gas supplies at the end of the dive unless there is an operational requirement for greater negative buoyancy during the dive. Buoyancy and trim can significantly affect drag of a diver. The effect of swimming with a head up angle of about 15¬∞, as is quite common in poorly trimmed divers, can be an increase in drag in the order of 50%. The ability to ascend at a controlled rate and remain at a constant depth is important for correct decompression. Recreational divers who do not incur decompression obligations can get away with imperfect buoyancy control, but when long decompression stops at specific depths are required, the risk of decompression sickness is increased by depth variations while at a stop. Decompression stops are typically done when the breathing gas in the cylinders has been largely used up, and the reduction in weight of the cylinders increases the buoyancy of the diver. Enough weight must be carried to allow the diver to decompress at the end of the dive with nearly empty cylinders. =Underwater vision= A diver wearing an Ocean Reef full face mask Water has a higher refractive index than air ‚Äì similar to that of the cornea of the eye. Light entering the cornea from water is hardly refracted at all, leaving only the eye's crystalline lens to focus light. This leads to very severe hypermetropia. People with severe myopia, therefore, can see better underwater without a mask than normal-sighted people. Diving masks and helmets solve this problem by providing an air space in front of the diver's eyes. The refraction error created by the water is mostly corrected as the light travels from water to air through a flat lens, except that objects appear approximately 34% bigger and 25% closer in water than they actually are. The faceplate of the mask is supported by a frame and skirt, which are opaque or translucent, therefore total field-of-view is significantly reduced and eye‚Äìhand coordination must be adjusted. Divers who need corrective lenses to see clearly outside the water would normally need the same prescription while wearing a mask. Generic corrective lenses are available off the shelf for some two-window masks, and custom lenses can be bonded onto masks that have a single front window or two windows. As a diver descends, they must periodically exhale through their nose to equalise the internal pressure of the mask with that of the surrounding water. Swimming goggles are not suitable for diving because they only cover the eyes and thus do not allow for equalisation. Failure to equalise the pressure inside the mask may lead to a form of barotrauma known as mask squeeze. Masks tend to fog when warm humid exhaled air condenses on the cold inside of the faceplate. To prevent fogging many divers spit into the dry mask before use, spread the saliva around the inside of the glass and rinse it out with a little water. The saliva residue allows condensation to wet the glass and form a continuous film, rather than tiny droplets. There are several commercial products that can be used as an alternative to saliva, some of which are more effective and last longer, but there is a risk of getting the anti-fog agent in the eyes. Dive lights Water attenuates light by selective absorption. Pure water preferentially absorbs red light, and to a lesser extent, yellow and green, so the colour that is least absorbed is blue light. Dissolved materials may also selectively absorb colour in addition to the absorption by the water itself. In other words, as a diver goes deeper on a dive, more colour is absorbed by the water, and in clean water the colour becomes blue with depth. Colour vision is also affected by turbidity of the water which tends to reduce contrast. Artificial light is useful to provide light in the darkness, to restore contrast at close range, and to restore natural colour lost to absorption. =Environmental protection= \\"Shorty\\" style wetsuit Scientific divers wearing dry suits Protection from heat loss in cold water is usually provided by wetsuits or dry suits. These also provide protection from sunburn, abrasion and stings from some marine organisms. Where thermal insulation is not important, lycra suits/diving skins may be sufficient. A wetsuit is a garment, usually made of foamed neoprene, which provides thermal insulation, abrasion resistance and buoyancy. The insulation properties depend on bubbles of gas enclosed within the material, which reduce its ability to conduct heat. The bubbles also give the wetsuit a low density, providing buoyancy in water. Suits range from a thin (2 mm or less) \\"shortie\\", covering just the torso, to a full 8 mm semi- dry, usually complemented by neoprene boots, gloves and hood. A good close fit and few zips help the suit to remain waterproof and reduce flushing ‚Äì the replacement of water trapped between suit and body by cold water from the outside. Improved seals at the neck, wrists and ankles and baffles under the entry zip produce a suit known as \\"semi-dry\\". A dry suit also provides thermal insulation to the wearer while immersed in water, and normally protects the whole body except the head, hands, and sometimes the feet. In some configurations, these are also covered. Dry suits are usually used where the water temperature is below 15 ¬∞C (60 ¬∞F) or for extended immersion in water above 15 ¬∞C (60 ¬∞F), where a wetsuit user would get cold, and with an integral helmet, boots, and gloves for personal protection when diving in contaminated water. Dry suits are designed to prevent water from entering. This generally allows better insulation making them more suitable for use in cold water. They can be uncomfortably hot in warm or hot air, and are typically more expensive and more complex to don. For divers, they add some degree of complexity as the suit must be inflated and deflated with changes in depth in order to avoid \\"squeeze\\" on descent or uncontrolled rapid ascent due to over-buoyancy. =Monitoring and navigation= A scuba dive computer Unless the maximum depth of the water is known, and is quite shallow, a diver must monitor the depth and duration of a dive to avoid decompression sickness. Traditionally this was done by using a depth gauge and a diving watch, but electronic dive computers are now in general use, as they are programmed to do real-time modelling of decompression requirements for the dive, and automatically allow for surface interval. Many can be set for the gas mixture to be used on the dive, and some can accept changes in the gas mix during the dive. Most dive computers provide a fairly conservative decompression model, and the level of conservatism may be selected by the user within limits. Most decompression computers can also be set for altitude compensation to some degree. If the dive site and dive plan require the diver to navigate, a compass may be carried, and where retracing a route is critical, as in cave or wreck penetrations, a guide line is laid from a dive reel. In less critical conditions, many divers simply navigate by landmarks and memory, a procedure also known as pilotage or natural navigation. A scuba diver should always be aware of the remaining breathing gas supply, and the duration of diving time that this will safely support, taking into account the time required to surface safely and an allowance for foreseeable contingencies. This is usually monitored by using a submersible pressure gauge on each cylinder. =Safety equipment= Cutting tools such as knives, line cutters or shears are often carried by divers to cut loose from entanglement in nets or lines. A surface marker buoy (SMB) on a line held by the diver indicates the position of the diver to the surface personnel. This may be an inflatable marker deployed by the diver at the end of the dive, or a sealed float, towed for the whole dive. A surface marker also allows easy and accurate control of ascent rate and stop depth for safer decompression. A bailout cylinder provides breathing gas sufficient for a safe emergency ascent. Various surface detection aids may be carried to help surface personnel spot the diver after ascent. In addition to the surface marker buoy, divers may carry mirrors, lights, strobes, whistles, flares or emergency locator beacons. =Accessories= Divers may carry underwater photographic or video equipment, or tools for a specific application in addition to diving equipment. Breathing from scuba Breathing from scuba is mostly a straightforward matter. Under most circumstances it differs very little from normal surface breathing. In the case of a full-face mask, the diver may usually breathe through the nose or mouth as preferred, and in the case of a mouth held demand valve, the diver will have to hold the mouthpiece between the teeth and maintain a seal around it with the lips. Over a long dive this can induce jaw fatigue, and for some people, a gag reflex. Various styles of mouthpiece are available off the shelf or as customised items, and one of them may work better if either of these problems occur. The frequently quoted warning against holding one's breath on scuba is a gross oversimplification of the actual hazard. The purpose of the admonition is to ensure that inexperienced divers do not accidentally hold their breath while surfacing, as the expansion of gas in the lungs could over-expand the lung air spaces and rupture the alveoli and their capillaries, allowing lung gases to get into the pulmonary return circulation, the pleura, or the interstitial areas near the injury, where it could cause dangerous medical conditions. Holding the breath at constant depth for short periods with a normal lung volume is generally harmless, providing there is sufficient ventilation on average to prevent carbon dioxide buildup, and is done as a standard practice by underwater photographers to avoid startling their subjects. Holding the breath during descent can eventually cause lung squeeze, and may allow the diver to miss warning signs of a gas supply malfunction until it is too late to remedy. Skilled open circuit divers can and will make small adjustments to buoyancy by adjusting their average lung volume during the breathing cycle. This adjustment is generally in the order of a kilogram (corresponding to a litre of gas), and can be maintained for a moderate period, but it is more comfortable to adjust the volume of the buoyancy compensator over the longer term. The practice of shallow breathing or skip breathing in an attempt to conserve breathing gas should be avoided as it tends to cause a carbon dioxide buildup, which can result in headaches and a reduced capacity to recover from a breathing gas supply emergency. The breathing apparatus will generally increase dead space by a small but significant amount, and cracking pressure and flow resistance in the demand valve will cause a net work of breathing increase, which will reduce the diver's capacity for other work. Work of breathing and the effect of dead space can be minimised by breathing relatively deeply and slowly. These effects increase with depth, as density and friction increase in proportion to the increase in pressure, with the limiting case where all the diver's available energy may be expended on simply breathing, with none left for other purposes. This would be followed by a buildup in carbon dioxide, causing an urgent feeling of a need to breathe, and if this cycle is not broken, panic and drowning are likely to follow. The use of a low density inert gas, typically helium, in the breathing mixture can reduce this problem, as well as diluting the narcotic effects of the other gases. Breathing from a rebreather is much the same, except that the work of breathing is affected mainly by flow resistance in the breathing loop. This is partly due to the carbon dioxide absorbent in the scrubber, and is related to the distance the gas passes through the absorbent material, and the size of the gaps between the grains, as well as the gas composition and ambient pressure. Water in the loop can greatly increase the resistance to gas flow through the scrubber. There is even less point in shallow or skip breathing on a rebreather as this does not even conserve gas, and the effect on buoyancy is negligible when the sum of loop volume and lung volume remains constant. A breathing pattern of slow, deep breaths which limits gas velocity and thereby turbulent flow in the air passages will minimise the work of breathing for a given gas mixture composition and density, and respiratory minute volume. Procedures The \\"Diver Down\\" flag, flown from a dive boat, warns surface watercraft when divers are in the water. The underwater environment is unfamiliar and hazardous, and to ensure diver safety, simple, yet necessary procedures must be followed. A certain minimum level of attention to detail and acceptance of responsibility for one's own safety and survival are required. Most of the procedures are simple and straightforward, and become second nature to the experienced diver, but must be learned, and take some practice to become automatic and faultless, just like the ability to walk or talk. Most of the safety procedures are intended to reduce the risk of drowning, and many of the rest are to reduce the risk of barotrauma and decompression sickness. In some applications getting lost is a serious hazard, and specific procedures to minimise the risk are followed. =Preparation for the dive= The purpose of dive planning is to ensure that divers do not exceed their comfort zone or skill level, or the safe capacity of their equipment, and includes gas planning to ensure that the amount of breathing gas to be carried is sufficient to allow for any reasonably foreseeable contingencies. Before starting a dive both the diver and their buddyA diving buddy is the other member of a two diver team. do equipment checks to ensure everything is in good working order and available. Recreational divers are responsible for planning their own dives, unless in training when the instructor is responsible. Divemasters may provide useful information and suggestions to assist the divers, but are generally not responsible for the details unless specifically employed to do so. In professional diving teams, all team members are usually expected to contribute to planning and to check the equipment they will use, but the overall responsibility for the safety of the team lies with the supervisor as the appointed on-site representative of the employer. =Standard diving procedures= Two divers giving the sign that they are \\"OK\\" Some procedures are common to almost all scuba dives, or are used to manage very common contingencies. These are learned at entry level and may be highly standardised to allow efficient cooperation between divers trained at different schools. * Water entry procedures are intended to allow the diver to enter the water without injury, loss of equipment, or damage to equipment. * Descent procedures cover how to descend at the right place, time, and rate; with the correct breathing gas available; and without losing contact with the other divers in the group. * Equalisation of pressure in gas spaces to avoid barotraumas. The expansion or compression of enclosed air spaces may cause discomfort or injury while diving. Critically, the lungs are susceptible to over-expansion and subsequent collapse if a diver holds their breath while ascending: during training divers are taught not to hold their breath while diving. Ear clearing is another critical equalisation procedure, usually requiring conscious intervention by the diver. * Mask and regulator clearing may be needed to ensure the ability to see and breathe in case of flooding. This can easily happen, and while immediate correct response is necessary, the procedure is simple and routine and is not considered an emergency. * Buoyancy control and diver trim require frequent adjustment (particularly during depth changes) to ensure safe, effective, and convenient underwater mobility during the dive. * Buddy checks, breathing gas monitoring, and decompression status monitoring are carried out to ensure that the dive plan is followed and that members of the group are safe and available to help each other in an emergency. * Ascent, decompression, and surfacing procedures are intended to ensure that dissolved inert gases are safely released, that barotraumas of ascent are avoided, and that it is safe to surface. * Water exit procedures are intended to let the diver leave the water without injury, loss of, or damage to equipment. * Underwater communication: Divers cannot talk underwater unless they are wearing a full-face mask and electronic communications equipment, but they can communicate basic and emergency information using hand signals, light signals, and rope signals, and more complex messages can be written on waterproof slates. = Decompression = Inert gas components of the diver's breathing gas accumulate in the tissues during exposure to elevated pressure during a dive, and must be eliminated during the ascent to avoid the formation of symptomatic bubbles in tissues where the concentration is too high for the gas to remain in solution. This process is called decompression, and occurs on all scuba dives. Decompression sickness is also known as the bends and can also include symptoms such as itching, rash, joint pain or nausea. Most recreational and professional scuba divers avoid obligatory decompression stops by following a dive profile which only requires a limited rate of ascent for decompression, but will commonly also do an optional short, shallow, decompression stop known as a safety stop to further reduce risk before surfacing. In some cases, particularly in technical diving, more complex decompression procedures are necessary. Decompression may follow a pre-planned series of ascents interrupted by stops at specific depths, or may be monitored by a personal decompression computer. =Post-dive procedures= These include debriefing where appropriate, and equipment maintenance, to ensure that the equipment is kept in good condition for later use. It is also considered a best practice to log each dive upon completion. This is done for several reasons: If a diver is planning on doing multiple dives in a day, they need to know what the depth and duration of previous dives were in order to calculate residual inert gas levels in preparation for the next dive. It is helpful to note what equipment was used for each dive and what the conditions were like for reference when planning another similar dive. For example, the thickness and type of wetsuit used during a dive, and if it was in fresh or salt water, will influence the amount of weight needed. Knowing this information and taking note of whether the weight used was too heavy or too light can help when planning another dive in similar conditions. In order to achieve a level of certification the diver may be required to present evidence of a specified number of logged and verified dives. Professional divers may be legally required to log specific information for every working dive. When a personal dive computer is used, it will accurately record the details of the dive profile, and this data can usually be downloaded to an electronic logbook, in which the diver can add the other details manually. =Buddy, team or solo diving= Buddy and team diving procedures are intended to ensure that a recreational scuba diver who gets into difficulty underwater is in the presence of a similarly equipped person who will understand the problem and can render assistance. Divers are trained to assist in those emergencies specified in the training standards for their certification, and are required to demonstrate competence in a set of prescribed buddy assistance skills. The fundamentals of buddy and team safety are centred on diver communication, redundancy of gear and breathing gas by sharing with the buddy, and the added situational perspective of another diver. There is general consensus that the presence of a buddy both willing and competent to assist can reduce the risk of certain classes of accidents, but much less agreement on how often this happens in practice. Solo divers take responsibility for their own safety and compensate for the absence of a buddy with skill, vigilance and appropriate equipment. Like buddy or team divers, properly equipped solo divers rely on the redundancy of critical articles of dive gear which may include at least two independent supplies of breathing gas and ensuring that there is always enough available to safely terminate the dive if any one supply fails. The difference between the two practices is that this redundancy is carried and managed by the solo diver instead of a buddy. Agencies that certify for solo diving require candidates to have a relatively high level of dive experience ‚Äì usually about 100 dives or more. Since the inception of scuba, there has been ongoing debate regarding the wisdom of solo diving with strong opinions on both sides of the issue. This debate is complicated by the fact that the line which separates a solo diver from a buddy/team diver is not always clear. For example, should a scuba instructor (who supports the buddy system) be considered a solo diver if their students do not have the knowledge or experience to assist the instructor through an unforeseen scuba emergency? Should the buddy of an underwater photographer consider themselves as effectively diving alone since their buddy (the photographer) is giving most or all of their attention to the subject of the photograph? This debate has motivated some prominent scuba agencies such as Global Underwater Explorers (GUE) to stress that its members only dive in teams and \\"remain aware of team member location and safety at all times.\\" Other agencies such as Scuba Diving International (SDI) and Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) have taken the position that divers might find themselves alone (by choice or by accident) and have created certification courses such as the \\"SDI Solo Diver Course\\" and the \\"PADI Self- Reliant Diver Course\\" in order to train divers to handle such possibilities. =Emergency procedures= The most urgent underwater emergencies usually involve a compromised breathing gas supply. Divers are trained in procedures for donating and receiving breathing gas from each other in an emergency, and may carry an independent alternative air source if they do not choose to rely on a buddy. Divers may need to make an emergency ascent in the event of a loss of breathing gas which cannot be managed at depth. Controlled emergency ascents are almost always a consequence of loss of breathing gas, while uncontrolled ascents are usually the result of a buoyancy control failure. Other urgent emergencies may involve loss of control of depth and medical emergencies. Divers may be trained in procedures which have been approved by the training agencies for recovery of an unresponsive diver to the surface, where it might be possible to administer first aid. Not all recreational divers have this training as some agencies do not include it in entry level training. Professional divers may be required by legislation or code of practice to have a standby diver at any diving operation, who is both competent and available to attempt rescue of a distressed diver. Two basic types of entrapment are significant hazards for scuba divers: Inability to navigate out of an enclosed space, and physical entrapment which prevents the diver from leaving a location. The first case can usually be avoided by staying out of enclosed spaces, and when the objective of the dive includes penetration of enclosed spaces, taking precautions such as the use of lights and guidelines, for which specialised training is provided in the standard procedures. The most common form of physical entrapment is getting snagged on ropes, lines or nets, and use of a cutting implement is the standard method of dealing with the problem. The risk of entanglement can be reduced by careful configuration of equipment to minimise those parts which can easily be snagged, and allow easier disentanglement. Other forms of entrapment such as getting wedged into tight spaces can often be avoided, but must otherwise be dealt with as they happen. The assistance of a buddy may be helpful where possible. Scuba diving in relatively hazardous environments such as caves and wrecks, areas of strong water movement, relatively great depths, with decompression obligations, with equipment that has more complex failure modes, and with gases that are not safe to breathe at all depths of the dive require specialised safety and emergency procedures tailored to the specific hazards, and often specialised equipment. These conditions are generally associated with technical diving. Depth range The depth range applicable to scuba diving depends on the application and training. The major worldwide recreational diver certification agencies consider to be the limit for recreational diving. British and European agencies, including BSAC and SAA, recommend a maximum depth of Shallower limits are recommended for divers who are youthful, inexperienced, or who have not taken training for deep dives. Technical diving extends these depth limits through changes to training, equipment, and the gas mix used. The maximum depth considered safe is controversial and varies among agencies and instructors, however, there are programs that train divers for dives to . Professional diving usually limits the allowed planned decompression depending on the code of practice, operational directives, or statutory restrictions. Depth limits depend on the jurisdiction, and maximum depths allowed range from to more than , depending on the breathing gas used and the availability of a decompression chamber nearby or on site. Commercial diving using scuba is generally restricted for reasons of occupational health and safety. Surface supplied diving allows better control of the operation and eliminates or significantly reduces the risks of loss of breathing gas supply and losing the diver. Scientific and media diving applications may be exempted from commercial diving constraints, based on acceptable codes of practice and a self-regulatory system. Applications Shooting underwater video on scuba Scuba diving may be performed for a number of reasons, both personal and professional. Recreational diving is done purely for enjoyment and has a number of technical disciplines to increase interest underwater, such as cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and deep diving. Underwater tourism is mostly done on scuba and the associated tour guiding must follow suit. Divers may be employed professionally to perform tasks underwater. Some of these tasks are suitable for scuba. There are divers who work, full or part-time, in the recreational diving community as instructors, assistant instructors, divemasters and dive guides. In some jurisdictions, the professional nature, with particular reference to responsibility for health and safety of the clients, of recreational diver instruction, dive leadership for reward and dive guiding is recognised and regulated by national legislation. Other specialist areas of scuba diving include military diving, with a long history of military frogmen in various roles. Their roles include direct combat, infiltration behind enemy lines, placing mines or using a manned torpedo, bomb disposal or engineering operations. In civilian operations, many police forces operate police diving teams to perform \\"search and recovery\\" or \\"search and rescue\\" operations and to assist with the detection of crime which may involve bodies of water. In some cases diver rescue teams may also be part of a fire department, paramedical service or lifeguard unit, and may be classed as public safety diving. Underwater maintenance and research in large aquariums and fish farms, and harvesting of marine biological resources such as fish, abalones, crabs, lobsters, scallops, and sea crayfish may be done on scuba. Boat and ship underwater hull inspection, cleaning and some aspects of maintenance (ships husbandry) may be done on scuba by commercial divers and boat owners or crew. Diver taking photos of a shark Lastly, there are professional divers involved with underwater environments, such as underwater photographers or underwater videographers, who document the underwater world, or scientific diving, including marine biology, geology, hydrology, oceanography and underwater archaeology. This work is normally done on scuba as it provides the necessary mobility. Rebreathers may be used when the noise of open circuit would alarm the subjects or the bubbles could interfere with the images. Scientific diving under the OSHA (US) exemption has been defined as being diving work done by persons with, and using, scientific expertise to observe, or gather data on, natural phenomena or systems to generate non-proprietary information, data, knowledge or other products as a necessary part of a scientific, research or educational activity, following the direction of a diving safety manual and a diving control safety board. The choice between scuba and surface-supplied diving equipment is based on both legal and logistical constraints. Where the diver requires mobility and a large range of movement, scuba is usually the choice if safety and legal constraints allow. Higher risk work, particularly in commercial diving, may be restricted to surface-supplied equipment by legislation and codes of practice. Safety The safety of underwater diving depends on four factors: the environment, the equipment, behaviour of the individual diver and performance of the dive team. The underwater environment can impose severe physical and psychological stress on a diver, and is mostly beyond the diver's control. Scuba equipment allows the diver to operate underwater for limited periods, and the reliable function of some of the equipment is critical to even short-term survival. Other equipment allows the diver to operate in relative comfort and efficiency. The performance of the individual diver depends on learned skills, many of which are not intuitive, and the performance of the team depends on communication and common goals. There is a large range of hazards to which the diver may be exposed. These each have associated consequences and risks, which should be taken into account during dive planning. Where risks are marginally acceptable it may be possible to mitigate the consequences by setting contingency and emergency plans in place, so that damage can be minimised where reasonably practicable. The acceptable level of risk varies depending on legislation, codes of practice and personal choice, with recreational divers having a greater freedom of choice. =Hazards= Scuba diving in a cave Divers touring a World War II shipwreck Divers operate in an environment for which the human body is not well suited. They face special physical and health risks when they go underwater or use high pressure breathing gas. The consequences of diving incidents range from merely annoying to rapidly fatal, and the result often depends on the equipment, skill, response and fitness of the diver and diving team. The hazards include the aquatic environment, the use of breathing equipment in an underwater environment, exposure to a pressurised environment and pressure changes, particularly pressure changes during descent and ascent, and breathing gases at high ambient pressure. Diving equipment other than breathing apparatus is usually reliable, but has been known to fail, and loss of buoyancy control or thermal protection can be a major burden which may lead to more serious problems. There are also hazards of the specific diving environment, and hazards related to access to and egress from the water, which vary from place to place, and may also vary with time. Hazards inherent in the diver include pre-existing physiological and psychological conditions and the personal behaviour and competence of the individual. For those pursuing other activities while diving, there are additional hazards of task loading, of the dive task and of special equipment associated with the task. The presence of a combination of several hazards simultaneously is common in diving, and the effect is generally increased risk to the diver, particularly where the occurrence of an incident due to one hazard triggers other hazards with a resulting cascade of incidents. Many diving fatalities are the result of a cascade of incidents overwhelming the diver, who should be able to manage any single reasonably foreseeable incident. Although there are many dangers involved in scuba diving, divers can decrease the risks through proper procedures and appropriate equipment. The requisite skills are acquired by training and education, and honed by practice. Open-water certification programmes highlight diving physiology, safe diving practices, and diving hazards, but do not provide the diver with sufficient practice to become truly adept. Scuba divers by definition carry their breathing gas supply with them during the dive, and this limited quantity must get them back to the surface safely. Pre-dive planning of appropriate gas supply for the intended dive profile lets the diver allow for sufficient breathing gas for the planned dive and contingencies. They are not connected to a surface control point by an umbilical, such as surface-supplied divers use, and the freedom of movement that this allows, also allows the diver to penetrate overhead environments in ice diving, cave diving and wreck diving to the extent that the diver may lose their way and be unable to find the way out. This problem is exacerbated by the limited breathing gas supply, which gives a limited amount of time before the diver will drown if unable to surface. The standard procedure for managing this risk is to lay a continuous guide line from open water, which allows the diver to be sure of the route to the surface. Most scuba diving, particularly recreational scuba, uses a breathing gas supply mouthpiece which is gripped by the diver's teeth, and which can be dislodged relatively easily by impact. This is generally easily rectified unless the diver is incapacitated, and the associated skills are part of entry-level training. The problem becomes severe and immediately life-threatening if the diver loses both consciousness and the mouthpiece. Rebreather mouthpieces which are open when out of the mouth may let in water which can flood the loop, making them unable to deliver breathing gas, and will lose buoyancy as the gas escapes, thus putting the diver in a situation of two simultaneous life-threatening problems. Skills to manage this situation are a necessary part of training for the specific configuration. Full-face masks reduce these risks and are generally preferred for professional scuba diving, but can make emergency gas sharing difficult, and are less popular with recreational divers who often rely on gas sharing with a buddy as their breathing gas redundancy option. =Risk= The risk of dying during recreational, scientific or commercial diving is small, and on scuba, deaths are usually associated with poor gas management, poor buoyancy control, equipment misuse, entrapment, rough water conditions and pre-existing health problems. Some fatalities are inevitable and caused by unforeseeable situations escalating out of control, but the majority of diving fatalities can be attributed to human error on the part of the victim. Equipment failure is rare in open circuit scuba. According to death certificates, over 80% of the deaths were ultimately attributed to drowning, but other factors usually combined to incapacitate the diver in a sequence of events culminating in drowning, which is more a consequence of the medium in which the accidents occurred than the actual accident. Scuba divers should not drown unless there are other contributory factors as they carry a supply of breathing gas and equipment designed to provide the gas on demand. Drowning occurs as a consequence of preceding problems such as unmanageable stress, cardiac disease, pulmonary barotrauma, unconsciousness from any cause, water aspiration, trauma, environmental hazards, equipment difficulties, inappropriate response to an emergency or failure to manage the gas supply. and often obscures the real cause of death. Air embolism is also frequently cited as a cause of death, and it, too is the consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed ascent, possibly aggravated by medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with cardiac events, mostly in older divers. There is a fairly large body of data on diving fatalities, but in many cases the data is poor due to the standard of investigation and reporting. This hinders research which could improve diver safety. Fatality rates are comparable with jogging (13 deaths per 100,000 persons per year) and are within the range where reduction is desirable by Health and Safety Executive (HSE) criteria, The most frequent root cause for diving fatalities is running out of or low on gas. Other factors cited include buoyancy control, entanglement or entrapment, rough water, equipment misuse or problems and emergency ascent. The most common injuries and causes of death were drowning or asphyxia due to inhalation of water, air embolism and cardiac events. Risk of cardiac arrest is greater for older divers, and greater for men than women, although the risks are equal by age 65. Several plausible opinions have been put forward but have not yet been empirically validated. Suggested contributing factors included inexperience, infrequent diving, inadequate supervision, insufficient predive briefings, buddy separation and dive conditions beyond the diver's training, experience or physical capacity. Decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism in recreational diving have been associated with specific demographic, environmental, and diving behavioural factors. A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors: age, asthma, body mass index, gender, smoking, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, previous decompression illness, years since certification, number of dives in the previous year, number of consecutive diving days, number of dives in a repetitive series, depth of the previous dive, use of nitrox as breathing gas, and use of a dry suit. No significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma, body mass index, cardiovascular disease, diabetes or smoking. Greater dive depth, previous decompression illness, number of consecutive days diving, and male biological gender were associated with higher risk for decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism. The use of dry suits and nitrox breathing gas, greater frequency of diving in the previous year, greater age, and more years since certification were associated with lower risk, possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience. Risk management has three major aspects besides equipment and training: Risk assessment, emergency planning and insurance cover. The risk assessment for a dive is primarily a planning activity, and may range in formality from a part of the pre-dive buddy check for recreational divers, to a safety file with professional risk assessment and detailed emergency plans for professional diving projects. Some form of pre-dive briefing is customary with organised recreational dives, and this generally includes a recitation by the divemaster of the known and predicted hazards, the risk associated with the significant ones, and the procedures to be followed in case of the reasonably foreseeable emergencies associated with them. Insurance cover for diving accidents may not be included in standard policies. There are a few organisations which focus specifically on diver safety and insurance cover, such as the international Divers Alert Network Training and certification US Navy SEAL divers train in 2019 Scuba training is normally provided by a qualified instructor who is a member of one or more diver certification agencies or is registered with a government agency. Basic diver training entails the learning of skills required for the safe conduct of activities in an underwater environment, and includes procedures and skills for the use of diving equipment, safety, emergency self-help and rescue procedures, dive planning, and use of dive tables or a personal decompression computer. Scuba skills which an entry-level diver will normally learn include: * Preparing and dressing in the diving suit * Assembly and pre-dive testing of the scuba set. * Entries and exits between the water and the shore or boat. * Breathing from the demand valve * Recovering and clearing the demand valve. * Clearing water from the mask, and replacing a dislodged mask. * Buoyancy control using weights and buoyancy compensator. * Finning techniques, underwater mobility and manoeuvering. * Making safe and controlled descents and ascents. * Equalisation of the ears and other air spaces. * Assisting another diver by providing air from one's own supply, or receiving air supplied by another diver. * How to return to the surface without injury in the event of a breathing supply interruption. * Use of emergency gas supply systems (professional divers). * Diving hand signals used to communicate underwater. Professional divers will also learn other methods of communication. * Dive management skills such as monitoring depth and time and the breathing gas supply. * Buddy diving procedures, including response to buddy separation underwater. * Basic dive planning regarding choice of entry and exit points, planned maximum depth and time to remain within no decompression limits. * Limited recognition of hazards, emergency procedures, and medical evacuation may be included. Some knowledge of physiology and the physics of diving is considered necessary by most diver certification agencies, as the diving environment is alien and relatively hostile to humans. The physics and physiology knowledge required is fairly basic, and helps the diver to understand the effects of the diving environment so that informed acceptance of the associated risks is possible. The physics mostly relates to gases under pressure, buoyancy, heat loss, and light underwater. The physiology relates the physics to the effects on the human body, to provide a basic understanding of the causes and risks of barotrauma, decompression sickness, gas toxicity, hypothermia, drowning and sensory variations. More advanced training often involves first aid and rescue skills, skills related to specialised diving equipment, and underwater work skills. =Recreational= Scuba diving education levels as used by ISO, PADI, CMAS, SSI and NAUI Basic diving skills training in a swimming pool Recreational diver training is the process of developing knowledge and understanding of the basic principles, and the skills and procedures for the use of scuba equipment so that the diver is able to dive for recreational purposes with acceptable risk using the type of equipment and in similar conditions to those experienced during training. Recreational (including technical) scuba diving does not have a centralised certifying or regulatory agency and is mostly self-regulated. There are, however, several international organisations of varying size and market share that train and certify divers and dive instructors, and many diving related sales and rental outlets require proof of diver certification from one of these organisations prior to selling or renting certain diving products or services. Not only is the underwater environment hazardous but the diving equipment itself can be dangerous. There are problems that divers must learn to avoid and manage when they do occur. Divers need repeated practice and a gradual increase in the challenge to develop and internalise the skills needed to control the equipment, to respond effectively if they encounter difficulties, and to build confidence in their equipment and themselves. Diver practical training starts with simple but essential procedures and builds on them until complex procedures can be managed effectively. This may be broken up into several short training programmes, with certification issued for each stage, or combined into a few more substantial programmes with certification issued when all the skills have been mastered. Many organizations exist, throughout the world, offering diver training leading to certification: the issuing of a \\"Diving Certification Card,\\" also known as a \\"C-card,\\" or qualification card. This diving certification model originated at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1952 after two divers died while using university-owned equipment and the SIO instituted a system where a card was issued after training as evidence of competence. Diving instructors affiliated to a diving certification agency may work independently or through a university, a dive club, a dive school or a dive shop. They will offer courses that should meet, or exceed, the standards of the certification organization that will certify the divers attending the course. Certification of the diver is done by the certification organisation on application by the registered instructor. The International Organization for Standardization has approved six recreational diving standards that may be implemented worldwide, and some of the standards developed by the World Recreational Scuba Training Council are consistent with the applicable ISO Standards, as are equivalent standards published by the Conf√©d√©ration Mondiale des Activit√©s Subaquatiques and the European Underwater Federation The initial open water training for a person who is medically fit to dive and a reasonably competent swimmer is relatively short. Many dive shops in popular holiday locations offer courses intended to teach a novice to dive in a few days, which can be combined with diving on the vacation. Other instructors and dive schools will provide more thorough training, which generally takes longer. Dive operators, dive shops, and cylinder filling stations may refuse to allow uncertified people to dive with them, hire diving equipment or have their diving cylinders filled. This may be an agency standard, company policy, or specified by legislation. =Professional= Class IV scientific divers assembling a structure during a training exercise It is fairly common for a national standard for commercial diver training and registration to apply within a country. These standards may be set by national government departments and empowered by national legislation, for example, in the case of the United Kingdom, where the standards are set by the Health and Safety Executive, and South Africa where they are published by the Department of Labour. Many national training standards and the associated diver registrations are recognised internationally among the countries which are members of the International Diving Regulators and Certifiers Forum (IDRCF). A similar arrangement exists for state-legislated standards, as in the case of Canada and Australia. Registration of professional divers trained to these standards may be directly administered by government, as in the case of South Africa, where diver registration is done by the Department of Labour, or by an approved external agent, as in the case of the Australian Diver Accreditation Scheme (ADAS) The following countries and organisations are members of the European Diving Technology committee, which publishes minimum standards for commercial diver training and competence accepted by these and some other countries through membership of the IDRCF and IDSA: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Romania, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Slovak republic, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA), International Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP), International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF), International Diving Schools Association (IDSA), European Underwater Federation, and International Diving Regulators and Certifiers Forum (IDRCF). These standards include Commercial SCUBA Diver. An example of a widely accepted training standard ‚Äì EDTC 2017 Commercial SCUBA Diver ‚Äì requires the professional scuba diver to be certified as medically fit to dive, and competent in skills covering the scope of: * Administrative procedures relating to statutory requirements, employment conditions, health and safety at the workplace, and the basic theoretical grounding in physics, physiology and medicine that are relevant to their work as a diver. * The skills required for routine diving operations, including working as part of the diving team, planning of diving operations, and diving in open water, exposed to the normal hazards of the diving environment, decompression procedures, serving as attendant to another diver, communications and the safe use of the tools appropriate to the work. * The skills in emergency procedures for management of reasonably foreseeable emergencies, including standby diver skills for diver assistance and rescue, management of emergencies unaided where appropriate, and team procedures for handling emergencies. * Preparation of diving and task-related equipment for use * Provision of first aid and basic life support procedures in a diving emergency, and assistance, under supervision, in the treatment of diving disorders * Competence to assist under supervision with chamber operations, including acting as inside attendant to an afflicted diver. International Diving Schools Association (IDSA) provides a Table of Equivalence of various national commercial diver training standards. Military scuba training is usually provided by the armed force's internal diver training facilities, to their specific requirements and standards, and generally involves basic scuba training, specific training related to the equipment used by the unit, and associated skills related to the particular unit. The general scope of requirements is generally similar to that for commercial divers, though standards of fitness and assessment may differ considerably. Records The current (2017) scuba depth record is held by Ahmed Gabr of Egypt who reached a depth of in the Red Sea in 2014, however this record is under investigation due to evidence suggesting it was faked. The record for cave penetration (horizontal distance from a known free surface) is held by Jon Bernot and Charlie Roberson of Gainesville, Florida, with a distance of .Gainesville Sun. 15 November 2016. Jarrod Jablonski and Casey McKinlay completed a traverse from Turner Sink to Wakulla Springs, on 15 December 2007, covering a distance of nearly . This traverse took approximately 7 hours, followed by 14 hours of decompression, and set the record as the longest cave diving traverse. The current record for the longest continuous submergence using SCUBA gear was set by Mike Stevens of Birmingham, England at the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham, during the annual National Boat, Caravan and Leisure Show between 14 February and 23 February 1986. He was continuously submerged for 212.5 hours. The record was ratified by the Guinness Book of Records.

After the family moved to Dallas, Texas, she attended and graduated from Hillcrest High School. After high school, Shapiro matriculated to The University of Texas at Austin, the first in her family to attend college, and graduated with a B.S. in secondary education. Shapiro began her professional career as a public school English and speech teacher for the Richardson Independent School District in Richardson, Texas. Shapiro also founded Shapiro & Company, an advertising, public relations and special events agency. She lives in Plano, Texas with her husband Howard; they have three children, Lisa Strauss of Houston, Todd Shapiro of Frisco, Texas, and Staci Rubin of Plano, and 12 grandchildren. Their names are Joshua, Noa, Ari, Ella, Sam, Zach, Natalie, Sophie, Olivia, Harper, Eli, and Brody. Political career =Local politics= Florence Shapiro entered politics after being elected to be a member of the Plano City Council, where she served six terms from 1979 to 1990. Shapiro was subsequently elected Mayor of Plano and served from 1990 to 1992. During this time, Shapiro was the President of the Texas Municipal League and the North Texas Council of Governments. =Texas Senate= Florence Shapiro was first elected to the Texas Senate in 1992, after defeating Democratic incumbent Ted Lyon, serving since 1993. In January 2005, she was elected President pro tempore of the State Senate, becoming second in the gubernatorial line of succession, behind the Lieutenant Governor of Texas. She was the first senator from Collin County to serve in that position in more than forty years. When both Governor Rick Perry and Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst were out of the state on official business on April 9, 2005, Shapiro served as the Governor for a day, the sixth woman in Texas history to do so. =U.S. Senate campaign speculation= Florence Shapiro and Roger Staubach Due to her friendship with Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, it was widely speculated that Shapiro would run for Hutchison's seat upon her resignation for her own gubernatorial run against Rick Perry. On July 15, 2008, Shapiro announced the formation of an exploratory committee for U.S. Senate, the first candidate to do so. It is chaired by former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach. Since the formation of the committee, Shapiro has begun heavy fundraising, both in Texas and out-of-state, and by the end of 2008, had raised more money than any other declared candidate, to date the highest of any declared Republican. Shapiro raised $226,000 in the fourth quarter of 2008 and ended the year with $373,556 in the bank. Early polls indicated Shapiro defeating former Texas State Comptroller John Sharp, but trailing current Houston mayor Bill White in head-to-head matchups. However, in January 2011, she decided against continuing a campaign for United States Senate. Saying that she is \\"committed to serving in the Texas State Senate now and in the future.\\" No go for Shapiro =Retirement from Texas Senate= In September 2011, Shapiro announced that she would not be a candidate for reelection. Republican former State Representative Tony Goolsby indicated that he would seek to succeed Shapiro, as did the military officer Scott O'Grady, but neither ran for the seat. Shapiro was instead succeeded in the Senate by fellow Republican Ken Paxton.

The film was produced by Turner Pictures and Hanna-Barbera and released by 20th Century Fox on November 23, 1994. The film was written for the screen by David Casci, based on a six-page pitch by writer Charles Pogue entitled \\"Library Days\\", presented to Casci by producer David Kirschner. The film was directed by Joe Johnston (live action) and Pixote Hunt and Glenn Chaika (animation), and produced by David Kirschner and Paul Gertz. The film received negative reviews and grossed $13.7 million from a budget of $34 million. The film's poor box office performance, along with Cats Don't Dance (1997), set back other animated films for the animation studio, Turner Feature Animation.  Plot  Pessimistic 10-year-old Richard Tyler lives life based on statistics and fears everything. His exasperated parents have tried multiple ways to build up his courage to little success. Richard is sent to buy a bag of nails for building a treehouse. However, Richard gets caught in a harsh thunderstorm and takes shelter in a library. He meets Mr. Dewey, an eccentric librarian who insists that he is in need of a special book and gives him a library card, despite Richard's protests. Searching for a phone, Richard finds a large rotunda painted with many famous literary characters. He slips on water dripping from his coat and falls over, knocking himself out. Richard awakens to find the rotunda art melting, which washes over him and the library, turning them into illustrations. He is met by the Pagemaster, the mythical Keeper of Books and Guardian of the Written Word. Richard asks for directions to the exit, so the Pagemaster sends him through the fiction section toward the green neon exit sign. Along the way, Richard befriends three anthropomorphic books: Adventure, a swashbuckling pirate-like book; Fantasy, a sassy but caring fairy tale book; and Horror, a fearful \\"Hunchbook\\" with a misshapen spine. The three agree to help Richard if he checks them out using his new library card. Together, the quartet encounters classic-fictional characters. They meet Dr. Jekyll who turns into Mr. Hyde, driving them to the open waters of the Land of Adventure. However, the group is separated after Moby-Dick attacks, following the whale's battle with Captain Ahab. Richard and Adventure are picked up by the Hispaniola, captained by Long John Silver. The pirates go to Treasure Island, but find no treasure except for one gold coin, nearly causing a mutiny. Fantasy and Horror return and defeat the pirates. Silver attempts to convince Richard to leave with him but surrenders when Richard threatens him with a sword. In the fantasy section, Richard sees the exit sign on the top of a mountain. However, Adventure's bumbling awakens a dormant dragon. Richard tries to fight the dragon with a sword and shield, but the dragon swallows him. Richard finds books in the dragon's stomach and uses a beanstalk from Jack and the Beanstalk to escape through the dragon's mouth. He and the books climb the beanstalk to reach the exit. They enter a large dark room where the Pagemaster awaits them. Richard accuses the Pagemaster of causing the horrors that he suffered, but the Pagemaster reveals the journey was intended to make Richard face his fears. Dr. Jekyll, Captain Ahab, Long John Silver, and the dragon reappear in a magical twister and congratulate him. The Pagemaster swoops Richard and the books into the twister, sending them back to the real world. Richard awakens, finding Adventure, Fantasy, and Horror lying next to him as real books. Mr. Dewey finds him, and, even though the library policy only allows a person to check out two books at time, lets him check out all three books \\"just this once\\". Richard returns home a braver boy, sleeping in his new treehouse with his books.  Cast  = Live-action = * Macaulay Culkin as Richard Tyler, a young 10-year-old boy who seems to have a fear of everything and runs his life based on safety statistics. Culkin is the only actor in the film to portray his character in both live-action and animation. * Christopher Lloyd as Mr. Dewey, the unconventional librarian and caretaker of a seemingly abandoned library. * Ed Begley Jr. and Mel Harris as Alan and Claire Tyler, Richard's supportive parents.

The Pirates of the Hispaniola are voiced by Richard Erdman, Fernando Escandon, Dorian Harewood, and Robert Picardo.  Production  The animation in the film was produced by Turner Feature Animation, headed by David Kirschner and recently spun off from Hanna-Barbera. The crew included animators who were veterans of productions such as An American Tail (1986) (also produced by David Kirschner and composed by James Horner), The Land Before Time (1988) and Aladdin (1992). This was one of the first films to feature live-action, traditional animation, and CGI animation all together. One scene involving a computer-generated dragon made from paint was used, a challenge for the filmmakers. All of the fictional works featured in the film were created and first published before January 1, 1923, making them a part of the public domain in most countries. The theme songs to the movie are \\"Dream Away\\", sung by Babyface and Lisa Stansfield, and \\"Whatever You Imagine\\", sung by Wendy Moten. According to the film's animation crew, the film went overbudget during animation production due to mismanagement and changes to the narrative. The 2001 book Producing Animation by Catherine Winder and Zahra Dowlatbadi (Johnston's assistant on The Pagemaster) recommends against making story changes during the animation process. Joe Johnston would later go on to express his dissatisfaction over the production, claiming that the film was re-edited without his consent. He has since crossed The Pagemaster off his r√©sum√©. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAdXnjYgz9U = Legal issue = The screenwriting credits for this film were the subject of a protracted legal arbitration with the Writers Guild of America (WGA)WGAw official case # 94SR002 when its producer, David Kirschner, attempted to claim sole authorship of the screenplay and original story, with no credit for its original screenwriter, David Casci. Typically, proposed credits are submitted to the WGA for approval well in advance of the release of a film or the publishing of posters or novelizations on which writing credits appear. In the case of The Pagemaster, the producers attempted to claim that, as the film was now largely animated, the WGA did not have jurisdiction to determine credits. Casci had written the screenplay under a WGA contract, as well as previous live-action versions for Disney Television dating back to 1985, also written under WGA contract. These facts positioned the WGA to get involved, testing their tenuous authority over a feature film with animated elements. After a lengthy investigation and interviews with those intimately familiar with the genesis of the Pagemaster project, including three persons within Kirschner's own office, the WGA credit arbitration process determined that David Casci was, in fact, the primary writer, and that Kirschner did not provide a sufficient creative contribution to the writing process to warrant any screenwriting credit. Upon receiving this determination by the WGA, Fox threatened to pull out of arbitration and release the film without WGA-approved credits, positioning the WGA to be forced to file an injunction blocking the film's heavily promoted Christmas season release. Ultimately, a settlement was reached, and Fox released the film with both Kirschner and Casci receiving story and screenplay credit, with a third writer, Ernie Contreras, also receiving screenplay credit. At the time, this case was the most expensive and extensive investigation of its type undertaken by the WGA on behalf of one of its members. = Extended and deleted scenes = The Pagemaster is presented in an extended cut version. During the production, some original scenes were removed, both live-action and animation. The deleted scenes and characters can be still seen during the making of the film, trailers and TV spots, SkyBox International trading cards, books and other related products. They can be also seen during the sneak peek on the 1993 VHS release of Once Upon a Forest, the 1994 VHS release of Rookie of the Year, and in the promotional trailer of the VHS release of the film on the promotional demo/screener VHS copy in 1995.  Release  The film was a production by Turner Pictures. 20th Century Fox handled U.S. distribution, while Turner Pictures Worldwide handled international distribution. Due to Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox and drop Fox's name as of January 2020, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures now handles domestic theatrical and home media rights to the film, while domestic television distribution rights are handled by Disney-ABC Domestic Television. WarnerMedia handles the broadcasting rights of the film to be aired on their variety of television networks (including Cartoon Network). Warner Bros. now handles international rights via Warner Bros. Pictures and television distribution and syndication rights to the film via Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution as a result of the Turner/Time Warner merger on October 10, 1996. The film grossed $13.7 million in North American theaters from a budget of $34 million.  Reception  On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 21% based on 19 reviews and an average rating of 4.39/10. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A- on scale of A to F. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times criticized the way the film's message came across, calling it a \\"sad and dreary film,\\" adding that its message seemed to be that \\"books can be almost as much fun as TV cartoons and video arcade games.\\" Brian Lowry of Variety said that the film's principal appeal for adults would be its abbreviated running time, and that it did not do enough with its famous fictional characters, noting \\"A more inspired moment has Richard using a book, 'Jack and the Beanstalk,' to escape from the belly of a dragon. Unfortunately, such moments are few and far between.\\" Rita Kempley of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, calling it a \\"splendidly original children's fantasy about the world of books.\\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave another positive review, calling it a \\"clever, often engaging, and always fast-paced motion picture\\" that \\"uses the visual medium to encourage its viewers to reach out with their imagination.\\" The Pagemaster earned a Razzie Award nomination for Macaulay Culkin as Worst Actor for his performance in the movie (also for Getting Even with Dad and Richie Rich) but lost the award to Kevin Costner for Wyatt Earp.  Year-end lists  * 10th ‚Äì Sandi Davis, The Oklahoman  Home media  The Pagemaster was first released on VHS and LaserDisc on April 4, 1995 by FoxVideo. 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film on DVD and Blu-ray on August 6, 2013.  Book adaptations  Contrary to any claims, the screenplay and film are not based on any book. David Casci's screenplay preceded all novelizations and illustrated books by several years. A number of books based on the film exist, including an illustrated book attributed to David Kirschner and Ernie Contreras, illustrated by Jerry Tiritilli, which contained large passages from the Casci screenplay without giving Casci writing credit. The film was well into production by the time this book was introduced in the 1993 F. A. O. Schwarz Christmas Catalog. Other properties based on the film include a novelization of the film, children's story books, pop-up books and other film ancillaries such as toys and games.  Video game  Video game adaptations of the film were released the same year as the film. They were developed by Probe Software Ltd. and published by Fox Interactive.https://pagemaster.enjin.com/ The PC and handheld versions of the game are almost entirely different games; the PC game is an interactive game and is developed by Mammoth Micro Productions, published by Turner Interactive and distributed by Turner Home Entertainment, and the handheld version is a platformer.

He was the ninth Archbishop of Philadelphia, serving from 2011 until 2020. He previously served as Archbishop of Denver (1997‚Äì2011) and Bishop of Rapid City (1988‚Äì1997). Unlike many of his predecessors as Archbishop of Philadelphia, he was not made a cardinal. Chaput is a professed Capuchin Franciscan. A member of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation, he is the second Native American to be consecrated a bishop in the United States and the first Native American archbishop. Early life Charles Chaput was born in Concordia, Kansas, one of three children of Joseph and Marian Helen (n√©e DeMarais) Chaput. His father was a French Canadian who was descended from the French saint King Louis IX. His mother was a Native American of the Prairie Band Potawatomi tribe; his maternal grandmother was the last member of the family to live on a reservation. Chaput himself was enrolled in the tribe at a young age, taking the name Pietasa (\\"rustling wind\\"). His Potawatomi name is \\"the wind that rustles the leaves of the tree\\" while his Sioux name is \\"good eagle\\".PhillyBurbs.com: \\"Next Philadelphia archbishop promises changes\\" By James McGinnis July 20, 2011 Chaput received his early education at Our Lady of Perpetual Help Grade School in Concordia, Kansas. Deciding to become a priest at the age of 13, he attended St. Francis Seminary High School in Victoria, Kansas. In 1965, at age 21, Chaput entered the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, a branch of the Franciscans, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1967, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy from St. Fidelis College Seminary in Herman, Pennsylvania. On July 14, 1968, he made his solemn profession as a Capuchin friar. In 1970, he earned a Master of Arts degree in religious education from Capuchin College in Washington, DC. Priesthood Chaput was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Cyril Vogel on August 29, 1970. He received a Master of Arts degree in theology from the University of San Francisco in 1971. From 1971 to 1974, he was an instructor in theology and spiritual director at his alma mater, St. Fidelis College. He then served as executive secretary and director of communications for the Capuchin province in Pittsburgh until 1977, from which position he was appointed pastor of Holy Cross Church in Thornton, Colorado. Chaput was elected vicar provincial for the Capuchin Province of Mid-America in 1977, later becoming secretary and treasurer for the province in 1980 and chief executive and provincial minister in 1983. He was among a group of Native Americans who greeted Pope John Paul II when the latter visited Phoenix, Arizona, during his 1987 trip to the United States. Episcopal career =Bishop of Rapid City= On April 11, 1988, Chaput was appointed Bishop of Rapid City, South Dakota, by Pope John Paul II. He was consecrated on the following July 26 by Archbishop Pio Laghi, with Archbishop John Roach and Archbishop James Stafford serving as co- consecrators. He was the second priest of Native American ancestry to be consecrated a bishop in the United States, after Donald Pelotte. He was the first Native American to be consecrated as an ordinary, rather than a titular bishop. He chose as his episcopal motto: \\"As Christ Loved the Church\\" (). =Archbishop of Denver= On February 18, 1997, Chaput was appointed as the Metropolitan Archbishop of Denver, Colorado, replacing Archbishop James Stafford. In 2007, Chaput gave the commencement address at Denver's Augustine Institute, a lay-run graduate school which he has actively supported. Since 2008, he has served as Episcopal moderator of the Tekakwitha Conference. In 2007, Chaput conducted an apostolic visitation of the Diocese of Toowoomba, Australia, on behalf of the Congregation for Bishops. His report contributed to a long campaign by Curial officials that resulted in the removal of Bishop Bill Morris in 2011. He was one of five bishops who conducted a Vatican- ordered investigation into the Legionaries of Christ in 2009‚Äì10 following accusations against the Legionaries' founder Marcial Maciel. =Archbishop of Philadelphia= On July 19, 2011, Chaput was appointed as archbishop of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He succeeded Cardinal Justin Francis Rigali, who had reached retirement age of 75 in April 2010, which meant Pope Benedict had replaced a self-effacing, behind-the-scenes prelate with one known for outspoken public leadership. His strong record in handling cases of sexual abuse by priests was also cited as a rationale for his appointment. He was installed as the archdiocese's ninth archbishop on September 8, 2011. On August 17‚Äì19, he gave catechesis at the World Youth Day 2011 in Madrid, Spain, similar to the function he performed at the 2008 World Youth Day in Sydney.Review of Archbishop Chaput's Render unto Caesar On November 14, 2014, at the fall meeting of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Chaput was elected as a delegate to the 2015 Synod of Bishops on the Family pending Vatican approval. Though Chaput led an historically important see and his five immediate predecessors were cardinals, Pope Benedict did not make him a cardinal in his two 2012 consistories, nor did Pope Francis in any of his. Pope Francis accepted his resignation on January 23, 2020. Views =Politics= As a seminarian, Chaput was an active volunteer in the presidential campaign of Robert Kennedy. As a young priest, he supported the election of Jimmy Carter in 1976. In his book Render unto Caesar: Serving the Nation by Living Our Catholic Beliefs in Political Life, Chaput exhorts Catholics to take a \\"more active, vocal, and morally consistent role\\" in the political process, arguing that private convictions cannot be separated from public actions without diminishing both. Rather than asking citizens to put aside their religious and moral beliefs for the sake of public policy, Chaput believes American democracy depends upon a fully engaged citizenry, including religious believers, to function properly.Cf. Chaput has stated that absolute loyalty to the Church's teachings on core, bioethical, and natural law doctrinal issues (that the Church has definitively spoken on, and where its stance is not subject to appreciable change in the future ‚Äì in this case, abortion) must be a higher priority for Catholics than their identity as Americans, their party affiliation, their party's stance on other issues, and the law of the country. This is so because, for a Catholic, loyalty to God, his supreme importance, and his expectations is more important than any other identity. He says that the martyrs and confessors gave witness to that fact. Regarding whether Catholic politicians who support legal abortion, contrary to Church teaching, should be denied Holy Communion, Chaput has written that, while denying anyone the Eucharist is a \\"very grave matter\\" that should be used only in \\"extraordinary cases of public scandal\\", those who are \\"living in serious sin or who deny the teachings of the Church\\" should voluntarily refrain from receiving communion. The New York Times in 2004 reported that Chaput took the position that it was sinful for Catholics to vote for Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. His remarks noted Kerry's pro-choice views, among others. According to the Times, he said that those who intended to vote for Kerry were \\"cooperating in evil\\" and needed \\"to go to confession\\". Chaput criticized the New York Times for the way it construed his remarks and the Archdiocese of Denver criticized the article as \\"heavily truncated and framed\\" and posted a full transcript of the interview. He stopped responding to New York Times inquiries for six years in part because of his belief the paper had misrepresented him. He was seen by some as \\"part of a group of bishops intent on throwing the weight of the Church into the elections\\". In public comments, his linkage of the Eucharist to the policy stances of political candidates and those who support them were seen by some as a politicization of moral theology. Chaput criticized what he views as a \\"spirit of adulation bordering on servility\\" toward President Barack Obama, remarking that \\"in democracies, we elect public servants, not messiahs\\". He stated that Obama tried to mask his record on abortion and other issues with \\"rosy marketing about unity, hope, and change\\". Chaput also dismissed the notion that Obama was given a broad mandate, reasoning that he was elected to \\"fix an economic crisis\\" and not to \\"retool American culture on the issues of marriage and the family, sexuality, bioethics, religion in public life, and abortion\\". Chaput said that in the 2016 American presidential election Americans were faced with the \\"worst choice in 50 years\\", because in his view both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were \\"deeply flawed\\" candidates. Following the 2019 shootings in Texas and Ohio, Chaput wrote that while he supports background checks for purchasers of firearms, \\"only a fool can believe that 'gun control' will solve the problem of mass violence. The people using the guns in these loathsome incidents are moral agents with twisted hearts. And the twisting is done by the culture of sexual anarchy, personal excess, political hatreds, intellectual dishonesty, and perverted freedoms that we've systematically created over the past half-century\\". =Opposition to LGBT rights movement= Chaput has taken positions against same-sex marriage and questioned the upbringing of children of same-sex couples. He has said that same-sex couples cannot show children that their parents love each other in the same way that opposite-sex couples can. In 2015, Chaput supported the dismissal of the director of religious education at Waldron Mercy Academy, Margie Winters, who had married her female partner in a civil marriage ceremony in 2007. When a parent reported this to the Archdiocese, the principal asked Winters to resign and when she refused, the school did not renew her contract. Many parents expressed anger and concern over the school's decision. Principal Nell Stetser said that \\"many of us accept life choices that contradict current Church teachings, but to continue as a Catholic school, Waldron Mercy must comply with those teachings.\\" She called for \\"an open and honest discussion about this and other divisive issues at the intersection of our society and our Church.\\" Chaput said the school administrators had shown \\"character and common sense at a moment when both seem to be uncommon'. On October 4, 2018, at the Synod on Young People and Vocations, Chaput objected to the use of the terms \\"LGBT\\" or \\"LGBTQ\\" in Church documents. He said: \\"There is no such thing as an ‚ÄòLGBTQ Catholic' or a 'transgender Catholic' or even a 'heterosexual Catholic,' as if our sexual appetites defined who we are; as if these designations described discrete communities of differing but equal integrity within the real ecclesial community, the body of Jesus Christ.\\" Chaput also denounced what he sees as a lack of orthodoxy in the Church generally, accusing Catholic leaders of the previous several decades of \\"ignorance, cowardice and laziness in forming young people to carry the faith into the future.\\" On March 27, 2019, in a speech to Ohio seminarians, he blamed sexual abuse in the Catholic Church on \\"a pattern of predatory homosexuality and a failure to weed that out from church life\\". =Immigration reform = Chaput advocates reform of immigration laws to regularize the status of most undocumented immigrants as a moral imperative.

During the 2006 season, Gbaja-Biamila was demoted from starter to second string defensive end behind starters Aaron Kampman and Cullen Jenkins and accepted the role of a pass rushing specialist who is most active on passing downs. In October 2007, Gbaja-Biamila broke the Green Bay Packers sack record with 69 sacks, which was previously held by Hall of Famer Reggie White with 68¬Ω sacks. Originally, Gbaja-Biamila was not credited with a third sack against Vikings quarterback Kelly Holcomb during the Packers vs. Vikings game on September 30. Later on in the week, the Elias Sports Bureau reviewed game footage and credited Gbaja- Biamila with a third sack on Kelly Holcomb, who was originally ruled as rushing for zero yards. Gbaja-Biamila played in seven games (one start) for the Packers in 2008, recording nine tackles, half a sack and a pass defensed. He was released on November 1 after the team activated defensive tackle Justin Harrell from the Physically Unable to Perform (PUP) list.Packers all-time sacks leader Gbaja-Biamila cut, Harrell activated He was a 2013 inductee, along with Packer kicker Chris Jacke, into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame. Family and personal life Gbaja-Biamila is the fifth child of his mother Bolatito Gbaja-Biamila (n√©e: Anjorin) and the second child of his father Mustapha Gbaja-Biamila. He is the older brother of former NFL linebacker Akbar Gbaja-Biamila. He also has a twin sister and another brother, Abdul. His middle name \\"Olarewaju\\" means \\"My Wealth is the future\\" in the Yoruba language, while his surname translates to \\"Big-Man-Come-Save-Me.\\" This comes from his paternal great-great-grandfather, who stood seven feet tall and was the village moderator in the Nigerian village in which he lived. Both of his parents were Muslim, until his mother converted to Christianity. While he was raised in a Sunni Muslim household, during his rookie season with the Green Bay Packers he converted to Christianity. He was the coordinator at the local Celebration Church Bayside for Crown Financial Ministries, which teaches people how to manage money using Biblical principles. He was involved in the first faith-based event at Lambeau Field called Lambeau Leap of Faith in July 2007, where thousands of Christians gathered. An adherent of the dietary laws outlined in the Book of Leviticus, Gbaja-Biamila no longer self-identifies as a Christian, but as a Hebrew Israelite. He formerly served on the board of directors at Freedom House Ministries, a shelter for homeless families in Green Bay. Each year Freedom House helps over 100 families including over 250 children overcome homelessness and move into stable permanent housing and employment. In 2007, he started Kabeer's Freedom House Sack Fund. He pledged, along with his teammates and members of the Green Bay community, $10,000 per sack registered in 2007 to go to his fund.

His two friends were arrested during an incident at Assembly of God Church in Green Bay on Dec 17 during a Christmas pageant put on by the private Providence Academy. Jordan Salmi and Ryan Desmith attended the pageant and triggered a trespassing complaint since they do not have children at the school. When they were arrested, they reportedly had concealed weapons on them without permits. The Green Bay Press-Gazette quoted Gbaha-Biamila saying ‚ÄúThey got my sons ‚Äî my property ‚Äî doing pagan worship, and I told them I forbid it, and they dishonor me and say it‚Äôs OK for my sons to dishonor their father.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúThey used the sons, the children, to oppress the man, and the woman rules over them, so that the man walks in error.‚Äù References Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:American football defensive ends Category:African-American players of American football Category:American Christians Category:Sportspeople from Los Angeles Category:San Diego State Aztecs football players Category:Green Bay Packers players Category:National Conference Pro Bowl players Category:American people of Nigerian descent Category:American people of Yoruba descent Category:Yoruba sportspeople Category:American former Muslims Category:Converts to Protestantism from Islam Category:Twin people from the United States Category:Wisconsin Republicans ","title":"Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila"},{"id":"1266519","text":"Atole (, from Nahuatl ƒÅt≈çlli ), also known as atolli and atol de elote, is a traditional hot corn- and masa-based beverage of Mesoamerican origin. Chocolate atole is known as champurrado or atole. It typically accompanies tamales, and is very popular during Day of the Dead (observed November 2nd) and Las Posadas (Christmas holiday season). In Mexico In Mexico, the drink typically includes masa (corn hominy flour), water, piloncillo (unrefined cane sugar), cinnamon, vanilla, and optional chocolate or fruit. The mixture is blended and heated before serving. Atole is made by toasting masa on a comal (griddle), then adding water that was boiled with cinnamon sticks. The resulting blends vary in texture, ranging from a porridge to a very thin, liquid consistency. Atole can also be prepared with rice, wheat, or oatmeal in place of masa. In northern Mexico, a variation is also made using pinole (sweetened toasted corn meal). Although atole is one of the traditional drinks of the Mexican holidays Day of the Dead and Las Posadas, it is very common during breakfast and dinnertime at any time of year. It is usually sold as street food. Atole served at the Atole Fair in Coacalco de Berrioz√°bal, State of Mexico In many parts of Mexico and in the United States in communities with Mexican cultural roots, atole is a traditional comfort food.

The resulting data base is very popular among social scientists for quantitative analyses of social and economic change. One of the most important precursors of the BHPS is the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), established in the 1960s at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (USA). The initial BHPS sample consisted of 10,300 individuals across Great Britain. Additional samples were recruited in Scotland and Wales in 1999 and the study was extended to Northern Ireland in 2001. As a panel survey it is a form of longitudinal study. The BHPS was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council from its inception in 1989 until 2008.

The transparent top admits sunlight and prevents heat escape via convection that would otherwise occur, particularly at night. Essentially, a cold frame functions as a miniature greenhouse to extend the growing season. Historically, cold frames were built to be used in addition to a heated greenhouse. The name itself exemplifies the distinction between the warm greenhouse and the unheated cold frame. They were frequently built as part of the greenhouse's foundation brickwork along the southern wall (in northern latitudes). This allowed seeds to be germinated in the greenhouse and then easily moved to the attached cold frame to be \\"hardened-off\\"coldframe.org.uk before final planting outside. Cold frames are similar to some enclosed hotbeds,merriam-webster.com also called hotboxes. The difference is in the amount of heat generated inside. This is parallel to the way that some greenhouses are called \\"hothouses\\" to emphasize their higher temperature, achieved either by the solar effects alone or by auxiliary heating via a heater or HVAC system of some kind. Cold frames are found in home gardens and in vegetable farming. They create microclimates that provide several degrees of air and soil temperature insulation, and shelter from wind. In cold-winter regions, these characteristics allow plants to be started earlier in the spring, and to survive longer into the fall and winter. They are most often used for growing seedlings that are later transplanted into open ground, and can also be a permanent home to cold-hardy vegetables grown for autumn and winter harvest. Construction Cold frame construction is a common home or farm building project, although kits and commercial systems are available. A traditional plan makes use of old glass windows: a wooden frame is built, about one to two feet tall, and the window placed on top. The roof is often sloped towards the winter sun to capture more light, and to improve runoff of water, and hinged for easy access. Clear plastic, rigid or sheeting, can be used in place of glass. An electric heating cable, available for this purpose, can be placed in the soil to provide additional heat. Uses Cold frames can be used to extend the growing season for many food and ornamental crops, primarily by providing increased warmth in early spring. This means that it's possible to harvest vegetable crops ahead of their normal season when they are extremely expensive to buy. Some crops suitable for growing in a cold frame include lettuces, parsley, salad onions, spinach, radishes and turnips etc. One vegetable crop can occupy the whole of a cold frame or a combination of crops can be grown so that they mature in rotation in order to get a wide range of different vegetables throughout the year from a single cold frame. Bulb frame A \\"bulb frame\\" is a specialized kind of cold frame, designed for growing hardy or almost hardy ornamental bulbous plants, particularly in climates with wet winters. Typically it is raised further above ground level than a normal cold frame, so that the plants can be seen better when in flower. They are often used for the cultivation of winter-growing bulbs which flower in the autumn or spring. The covers are used in winter to provide some protection from very bad weather, while allowing good ventilation. Then in the summer, the covers provide dry, warm conditions which many such bulbs need.

Delany. It was written in San Francisco in 1969 and completed just days before the Stonewall Riots in New York City. A further draft was completed in 1973 in London. At the time it was written, no one would publish it due to its graphic descriptions of murder, child molestation, incest, coprophilia, coprophagia, urolagnia, anal-oral contact, necrophilia and rape. Hogg was finally published - with some further, though relatively minor, rewrites - in 1995 by Black Ice Books. The two successive editions have featured some correction, the last of which, published by Fiction Collective Two in 2004, carries a note at the end stating that it is definitive. Content =Preface= The preface to the novel is titled \\"The Scorpion Garden\\". It is not included in the hardback edition from 1995, although it was written in 1973. It is included in The Straits of Messina (1989). =Description= As described in the book Inventory by The A.V. Club, These acts include a substantial amount of \\"rape, violence, and murder\\", such as \\"scenes of Hogg and his gang brutally raping various women\\" and other \\"extensive scenes involving consumption of bodily waste.\\" Every chapter in the novel contains graphic sexual or violent acts. =Setting= The main events of the novel take place on June 26, 27, and 28, 1969, in an unspecified city. The narrator mentions various nearby areas‚Äî\\"Crawhole,\\" \\"Frontwater,\\" and \\"Ellenville\\"‚Äîapparently fictional neighborhoods. The nameless city could be described as an industrial wasteland. The events take place at docks, garbage barges, truck-stops, bars, as well as within Hogg's truck. Many of the characters are described as workmen or wear work clothes. In an interview with TK Enright, Delany states \\"[Hogg's] action takes place in Pornotopia‚Äîthat is the land where any situation can become rampantly sexual under the least increase in the pressure of attention. Like its sister lands, Comedia and Tragedia, it can only be but so realistic.\\" In the same interview Delany also states, \\"Hogg is another of my stories that takes place in the city of Enoch.\\" Delany's Nevery√≥na takes place, in part, in Enoch. =Plot summary= At the start, the narrator is living with a Hispanic boy named Pedro and performing sex acts with older men in the basement of the dwelling for money, along with Pedro's teenage sister Maria. He engages in sex with Maria, Pedro, a gang of bikers, and a group of black men. The narrator consistently assumes the bottom role in these sex acts. One out of the group of black men chooses the narrator specifically, remarking that he appears of possible part-black ancestry. The second chapter takes place sometime after the narrator has left Pedro's. It introduces Hogg, raping a woman in an alley. Hogg calls the narrator to him to \\"finish him up\\" orally. Hogg takes the narrator to his truck where he explains that while he is a trucker by trade, he prefers getting paid to rape women. Hogg also reveals a bit about himself and his personal history, painting a picture of his overall persona, which is one of extreme filth, violence, and sexual sociopathy. They drive to meet Mr. Jonas, who despite his apparent wealth answers his own door and later is revealed to drive his own limousine. Mr. Jonas is Hogg's current client. After Mr. Jonas describes Hogg's next assignment Hogg states his intention to bring along several other men, and the narrator as well, to participate. At this point the narrator's place as Hogg's companion is solidly established. Hogg and the narrator meet the other men‚ÄîNigg, Wop, and Denny‚Äîat the Piewacket bar. Nigg turns out to be the black man who the narrator first encountered at the beginning of the story. Wop is a violent Italian-American workman. Denny is a rather shy teenage boy, older than the narrator but quite a bit younger than the other men. The quintet of rapists set out to complete their jobs, which grow in succession from a single woman, a woman and her wheelchair-bound daughter, and a nuclear family‚Äîmother, father and son. Each successive job increases in violence, and the victims' young children (male and female) are also descended on by the pack. During the third rape scene, Denny absconds to the family's kitchen where he decides to pierce his own penis using a nail. Soon Denny's penis begins to bleed, swell and pus, seemingly infected. At this point he begins repeating the phrase \\"it's all right.\\" When their last job is completed, the group retires to the Piewacket bar, where they fraternize with members of the Phantoms‚Äîthe same biker gang encountered in the beginning of the novel. Nigg and one of the bikers, Hawk, hatch a scheme to sell the narrator to a black tugboat captain called Big Sambo. Without consulting Hogg, all three ride away on Hawk's motorcycle to meet Big Sambo at the docks in Crawhole. Big Sambo talks down the price and pays Nigg and Hawk fifteen dollars for the narrator. Big Sambo is a large, physically-powerful tugboat operator who keeps his twelve-year-old daughter, Honey-Pie, around as a sex object for his own pleasure. The narrator goes walking around the docks at night, where he overhears a radio on the deck of a garbage scow. The newscaster on the radio reports on a series of murders that has occurred recently‚Äîas it turns out, the suspect is Denny. This is confirmed to the reader when it is noted that the phrase \\"it's all right\\" is written in blood at the crime scenes. The Piewacket bar, where the gang had previously hung out, was attacked by Denny with gunfire. Several people including the bartender and some bikers were killed. On the docks the narrator then meets two garbagemen: Red, a red-headed white man, and Rufus, a black man. While having sex with the narrator outside, they plan to \\"borrow\\" the narrator from Big Sambo and keep him at their scow on a collar and leash. They are interrupted by Whitey, a cop who patrols the area, who also has sex with the narrator. Whitey is called down to the waterfront to help investigate the murders of Mona, Harry and their year-old baby. Rufus, Red and the narrator return to the waterfront where a radio crew has recently arrived and reports live from the scene. Big Sambo sees the narrator by the docks and tells him to return to his scow. Hogg arrives at Big Sambo's scow and assaults Big Sambo. Hogg and the narrator leave the docks in Hogg's truck, in which Denny was hiding from the police. After driving out of the Crawhole area and getting clear of the law, Hogg commands Denny to bathe himself, dress in clean clothes, and hitch a ride to Florida. While driving back from the truck stop Hogg declares his intentions to spend the next few months with the narrator and expresses his happiness that they are reunited. However, the narrator is formulating a plan to leave Hogg at the next opportune moment. Hogg finally asks him \\"What's the matter?\\" to which he responds, \\"Nothin,\\"‚Äîhis only line of dialog in the novel. Character analysis =Franklin \\"Hogg\\" Hargus= Michael Hemmingson wrote in the journal The Review of Contemporary Fiction that Hogg, Literary significance and criticism Despite the book's pornographic surface, respected authors have given it their endorsement. Norman Mailer, for instance, said \\"There is no question that Hogg by Samuel R. Delany is a serious book with literary merit.\\" J.G. Ballard, prolific speculative-fiction author and elder statesman of transgressive literature, also praised Delany's work, citing the medium of pornography as being the \\"most political form of fiction.\\" Author Dennis Cooper said in his collection Smothered in Hugs: Essays, Interviews, Feedback, and Obituaries that \\"Hogg is tiresome and indulgent\\" and that the \\"pace is molasses-slow\\". However, he also goes on to say that \\"the book is a highly charged object...[and] that's reason enough to recommend it.\\" In the Preface to a later edition of \\"Smothered in Hugs,\\" Cooper writes, \\"I now think Samuel Delany's \\"Hogg\\" is a great novel, and I don't know why I didn't realize that upon first reading.\\" Jeffrey A. Tucker, associate professor of English at the University of Rochester, comments in his critical study A sense of wonder: Samuel R. Delany, race, identity and difference that Hogg \\"gave expression to the author's hostility toward a heterosexist society, an anger that had no socially constructive outlet prior to the modern Gay Rights movement.\\" Trivia The off-stage murder spree by Dennis \\"Denny\\" Harkner is described by radio reporter Edward Sawyer as \\"an afternoon and evening long rampage...that threatens to outdo Starkweather, Speck, and Manson together.\\" Later in the novel it is revealed that the spree took place on June 27th, 1969, more than a month before the Tate murders were perpetrated by the Manson Family on August 8th, 1969.

In 1913, there were three pairs of trains operating on a Vancouver, BC to Portland, Oregon route in 12 to ; with the overnight train carrying the name The Owl. In addition, there was a Vancouver‚ÄìSeattle local, a Bellingham‚ÄìRockport local, and a Vancouver‚ÄìNew Westminster mixed. The depression took its toll on these services; through Vancouver to Portland services were discontinued, with the Seattle to Portland segment being pooled with Northern Pacific Railway and the Union Pacific Railroad from 1925. By 1928, the Vancouver to Seattle service had been reduced to three pairs of trains: 356/357 The Owl, 358/359 International Limited, and 360 The Canadian and 355 The American. (Odd train numbers were westbound by timetable, southbound by compass, even numbers were eastbound by timetable, northbound by compass). By Spring 1937, The Owl had been discontinued, with 355/358 being limited stop and 359/360 the locals. This arrangement persisted through World War II unit 1946 when servce was expanded to three pair of trains: 359/360 became the Morning Puget Sounder, 355/358 the Afternoon Puget Sounder (all limited stop) and 356/357 were restored as the unnamed locals. In June 1950 the GN replaced both heavyweight Puget Sounders with three streamlined Internationals, although only two trainsets were needed, as each set made one-and-one-half round trips daily. In February 1956, the locals were discontinued, and the Internationals were renumbered. In May 1960, the evening International was discontinued; the noon service became known as the afternoon service. There was an upswing of traffic during the Century 21 Exposition (the 1962 Seattle World's Fair); to cope with this extra traffic, the Great Northern bought several 56-seat coaches from the Chicago and North Western Railway that had become surplus after the discontinuation of some of the CNW's 400 trains. These were placed in GN's short-haul streamliners, which released long-haul coaches for the Empire Builder and the Western Star.. In 1966 the Great Northern took delivery of six EMD SDP40 locomotives for use on the Western Star; they were also used on the Internationals between the westbound Western Star‚Äôs arrival, and the eastbound departure.. The following year, eight EMD SDP45 locomotives joined their ranks. In June 1969, trains 357 and 358, the morning service was discontinued in Washington state, it was October before the Canadian authorities completed their approvals. In the meantime a Vancouver to White Rock, BC shuttle service operated, but the crew usually outnumbered the passengers ‚Äì if there were any.. Due to the schedules needed to maintain reasonable connections with the Empire Builder and the Coast Pool Trains, two trainsets were still required. Trains 359 and 360 continued through the Burlington Northern Railroad merger of March 1970; BN renumbered them as trains 193 and 194. They finally expired fourteen months later as one of many trains discontinued on the startup of Amtrak on May 1, 1971. Amtrak would later operate the Pacific International over the same route 1972‚Äì1981. Service returned again in 1995 as the Mount Baker International, operated by Amtrak in partnership with the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). Since 1998, the route has been part of the Amtrak Cascades service using leased Talgo Pendular equipment, with one round trip from Seattle to Vancouver and one from Portland to Vancouver.

Journalistic objectivity may refer to fairness, disinterestedness, factuality, and nonpartisanship, but most often encompasses all of these qualities. First evolving as a practice in the 18th century, a number of critiques and alternatives to the notion have emerged since, fuelling ongoing and dynamic discourse surrounding the ideal of objectivity in journalism. Most newspapers and TV stations depend upon news agencies for their material, and each of the four major global agencies (Agence France- Presse (formerly the Havas agency), Associated Press, Reuters, and Agencia EFE) began with and continue to operate on a basic philosophy of providing a single objective news feed to all subscribers. That is, they do not provide separate feeds for conservative or liberal newspapers. Journalist Jonathan Fenby has explained the notion: > To achieve such wide acceptability, the agencies avoid overt partiality. The > demonstrably correct information is their stock-in-trade. Traditionally, > they report at a reduced level of responsibility, attributing their > information to a spokesman, the press, or other sources. They avoid making > judgments and steer clear of doubt and ambiguity. Though their founders did > not use the word, objectivity is the philosophical basis for their > enterprises ‚Äì or failing that, widely acceptable neutrality.Jonathan Fenby, > The International News Services (1986) p. 25 Objectivity in journalism aims to help the audience make up their own mind about a story, providing the facts alone and then letting audiences interpret those on their own. To maintain objectivity in journalism, journalists should present the facts whether or not they like or agree with those facts. Objective reporting is meant to portray issues and events in a neutral and unbiased manner, regardless of the writer's opinion or personal beliefs.Clark, Roy Peter. \\"The Pyramid of Journalism Competence: What Journalists Need to Know\\". Pointer. 2014. Web. 28 Sept. 2015.  Definitions  Sociologist Michael Schudson suggests that \\"the belief in objectivity is a faith in 'facts,' a distrust in 'values,' and a commitment to their segregation\\". Objectivity also outlines an institutional role for journalists as a fourth estate, a body that exists apart from government and large interest groups.Schudson, Discovering the News Journalistic objectivity requires that a journalist not be on either side of an argument. The journalist must report only the facts and not a personal attitude toward the facts. While objectivity is a complex and dynamic notion that may refer to a multitude of techniques and practices, it generally refers to the idea of \\"three distinct, yet interrelated, concepts\\": truthfulness, neutrality, and detachment. Truthfulness is a commitment to reporting only accurate and truthful information, without skewing any facts or details to improve the story or better align an issue with any certain agenda. Neutrality suggests that stories be reported in an unbiased, even-handed, and impartial manner. Under this notion, journalists are to side with none of the parties involved, and simply provide the relevant facts and information of all. The third idea, detachment, refers to the emotional approach of the journalist. Essentially, reporters should not only approach issues in an unbiased manner but also with a dispassionate and emotionless attitude. Through this strategy, stories can be presented in a rational and calm manner, letting the audience make up their minds without any influences from the media. History The modern notion of objectivity in journalism is largely due to the work of Walter Lippmann.The lost meaning of ‚Äòobjectivity‚Äô Lippmann was the first to widely call for journalists to use the scientific method for gathering information.Defining Objectivity within Journalism, University of Gothenburg Lippmann called for journalistic objectivity after the excesses of yellow journalism. He noted that the yellows at the time had served their purpose, but that the people needed to receive the actual news, and not a \\"romanticized version of it\\".Kansas industrialist. p. 6 The term objectivity was not applied to journalistic work until the 20th century, but it had fully emerged as a guiding principle by the 1890s. Michael Schudson,Michael Schudson's faculty page ; Columbia Journalism School, accessed 20 December 2012 among a number of other communication scholars and historians, agree that the idea of objectivity has prevailed in dominant discourse among journalists in the United States since the appearance of modern newspapers in the Jacksonian Era of the 1830s. These papers transformed the press amidst the democratization of politics, the expansion of a market economy, and the growing authority of an entrepreneurial, urban middle class. Before then, American newspapers were expected to present a partisan viewpoint, not a neutral one. The need for objectivity first occurred to Associated Press editors who realize that partisanship would narrow their potential market. Their goal was to reach all newspapers and leave it to the individual papers to decide on what slanting and commentary were needed. Lawrence Gobright, the AP chief in Washington, explained the philosophy of objectivity to Congress in 1856: > My business is to communicate facts. My instructions do not allow me to make > any comments upon the facts which I communicate. My dispatches are sent to > papers of all manner of politics, and the editors say they are able to make > their own comments upon the facts which are sent to them. I, therefore > confine myself to what I consider legitimate news. I do not act as a > politician belonging to any school, but try to be truthful and impartial. My > dispatches are a merely dry matter of fact and detail.Richard Schwarzlose > (1989). Nation's Newsbrokers Volume 1: The Formative Years: From > Pretelegraph to 1865. p. 179. But into the first decade of the twentieth century, it was uncommon to see a sharp divide between facts and values. However, during World War I, scholar Stuart Allan (1997) suggests that propaganda campaigns, as well the rise of \\"press agents and publicity experts\\", fostered the growing cynicism among the public towards state institutions and \\"official channels of information\\". The elevation of objectivity thus constituted as an effort to re-legitimatize the news-press, as well as the state in general. Some historians, like Gerald Baldasty, have observed that objectivity went hand in hand with the need to make profits in the newspaper business by attracting advertisers. In this economic analysis, publishers did not want to offend any potential advertising clients and therefore encouraged news editors and reporters to strive to present all sides of an issue. Advertisers would remind the press that partisanship hurts circulation, and, consequently, advertising revenues - thus, objectivity was sought. Others have proposed a political explanation for the rise of objectivity; scholars like Richard Kaplan have argued that political parties needed to lose their hold over the loyalties of voters and the institutions of government before the press could feel free to offer a nonpartisan, \\"impartial\\" account of news events. This change occurred following the critical 1896 election and the subsequent reform of the Progressive Era. Later, during the period following World War II, the newly formalized rules and practices of objectivity led to a brief national consensus and temporary suspension of negative public opinion; however, doubts and uncertainties in \\"the institutions of democracy and capitalism\\" resurfaced in the period of civil unrest during the 1960s and 1970s, ultimately leading to the emergence of the critique of objectivity. In conclusion, there are three key factors in the origin of objectivity. The transition from a political model of journalism to a commercial model requires the production of content that can be marketed across the political and ideological spectrum. The telegraph imposes pressures on journalists to prioritize the most important facts at the beginning of the story and adopt a simplified, homogenized and generic style that could appeal to geographically diverse audiences. In the early 20th century, journalism started to define itself as a professional occupation that required special training, unique skills and self-regulation according to ethical principles (Professionalization normalized the regime of objectivity as the foundation of good journalism, providing benefits to journalists and editors/publishers. For most of the 19th century, most of the publications and news were written by one person. Writers can express their own perspectives and opinions which they are still attempted to good morals in their readers. However, since the 1880s, Americans started to become interested in some scientific theories and facts which narrowed the ways that writers express their feelings. The use of technology became more productivity and control. New tech in the news process has worked to establish a discourse of speed. The discourse of speed has also become stronger and more encompassing over time. The transformation of the newspaper produced a medium requiring a fairly sophisticated of many different kinds of laborers. Journalists are expected to technical skills in computer-based and new media technologies to some extent placed new demands on journalists now.  Criticisms  Megan Willams (journalist), \\"...Objectivity does not exist (especially for journalists)...\\"; interviewed in Varanasi in December 2010 by Vrinda Dar Some scholars and journalists criticize the understanding of objectivity as neutrality or nonpartisanship, arguing that it does a disservice to the public because it fails to attempt to find truth. They also argue that such objectivity is nearly impossible to apply in practice‚Äînewspapers inevitably take a point of view in deciding what stories to cover, which to feature on the front page, and what sources they quote. The media critics Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky have advanced a propaganda model hypothesis proposing that such a notion of objectivity results in heavily favoring government viewpoints and large corporations. Mainstream commentators accept that news value drives selection of stories, but there is some debate as to whether catering to an audience's level of interest in a story makes the selection process non-objective. Another example of an objection to objectivity, according to communication scholar David Mindich, was the coverage that the major papers (most notably the New York Times) gave to the lynching of thousands of African Americans during the 1890s. News stories of the period described the hanging, immolation and mutilation of people by mobs with detachment and, through the regimen of objectivity, news writers often attempted to construct a \\"false balance\\" of these accounts by recounting the alleged transgressions of the victims that provoked the lynch mobs to fury. Mindich suggests that by enabling practices of objectivity and allowing them to \\"[go] basically unquestioned\\", it may have had the effect of normalizing the practice of lynching.Just the Facts: How \\"Objectivity\\" Came to Define American Journalism, 1998 In a more recent example, scholars Andrew Calcutt and Phillip Hammond (2011) note that since the 1990s, war reporting (especially) has increasingly come to criticize and reject the practice of objectivity. In 1998, a BBC reporter, Martin Bell, noted that he favoured a \\"journalism of attachment\\", over the previously sought after dispassionate approach.Bell, Martin (1998) ‚ÄòThe Journalism of Attachment‚Äô, in Matthew Kieran (ed.), Media Ethics, London and New York, NY: Routledge. Similarly, a CNN war correspondent from the US, Christiane Amanpour, stated that in some circumstances \\"neutrality can mean you are an accomplice to all sorts of evil\\".Ricchiardi, Sherry (1996) ‚ÄòOver the Line?‚Äô, American Journalism Review, 18 (September): 24‚Äì31. Each of these opinions stems from scholar's and journalist's critique of objectivity as too \\"heartless\\" or \\"forensic\\" to report the human natured and emotionally charged issues found in war and conflict reporting. As discussed above, with the growth of mass media, especially from the 19th century, news advertising became the most important source of media revenue. Whole audiences needed to be engaged across communities and regions to maximize advertising revenue. This led to \\"[j]ournalistic [o]bjectivity as an industry standard [‚Ä¶] a set of conventions allowing the news to be presented as all things to all people\\".Lynch, J. & McGoldrick, A. (2005). Peace Journalism. Gloucestershire: Hawthorn Press, p. 203 In modern journalism, especially with the emergence of 24-hour news cycles, speed is of the essence in responding to breaking stories. It is therefore not possible for reporters to decide \\"from first principles\\" how they will report each and every story that presents itself - thus, some scholars argue that mere convention (versus a true devotion to truth-seeking) has come to govern much of journalism. Brent Cunningham, the managing editor of Columbia Journalism Review,Brent Cunningham's faculty page Columbia Journalism School, accessed 20 December 2012 argues that objectivity excuses lazy reporting. He suggests that objectivity makes us passive recipients of news, rather than aggressive analyzers and critics of it. According to Cunningham, the nut of the tortured relationship with objectivity lies within a number of conflicting diktats that the press was subjected to operate under: be neutral yet investigative; be disengaged yet have an impact; and be fair- minded yet have an edge. Cunningham, however, argues that reporters by and large are not ideological warriors; rather, they are imperfect people performing a difficult job that is crucial to society and, \\"[d]espite all our important and necessary attempts to minimize [individual's] humanity, it can't be any other way,\\" Cunningham concludes. The debate about objectivity is lit also within the photojournalism field. In 2011, Italian photographer Ruben Salvadori challenged the expectation of objective truth that the general public associates to photojournalism with his project \\"Photojournalism Behind the Scenes\\". By including the traditionally invisible photographer into the frame, Salvadori sought to ignite a discussion about the ethics of the profession, and indicate a need for audiences to be active viewers who understand and recognize the potential subjectivity of the photographic medium. Another notion circulating around the critique of objectivity is proposed by scholar Judith Lichtenberg. She points to the logical inconsistency that arises when scholars or journalists criticize journalism for failing to be objective, while simultaneously proposing that there is no such thing as objectivity. Underpinning critiques of objectivity that arose in the 1970s and 1980s, this dual theory - which Lichtenberg refers to as a \\"compound assault on objectivity\\"Lichtenberg, Judith (1991) ‚ÄòIn Defense of Objectivity‚Äô, in James Curran and Michael Gurevitch (eds.), Mass Media and Society, London: Arnold. \\\\- invalidates itself, as each element of the argument repudiates the other. Lichtenberg agrees with other scholars that view objectivity as mere conventional practice: she states that \\"much of what goes under the name of objectivity reflects shallow understanding of it\\". Thus, she suggests that these practices, rather than the overall notion of objectivity (whose primary aim, according to Lichtenberg, is only to seek and pursue truth), should really be the target of critique. Alternatives Some argue that a more appropriate standard should be fairness and accuracy (as enshrined in the names of groups like Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting). Under this standard, taking sides on an issue would be permitted as long as the side taken was accurate and the other side was given a fair chance to respond. Many professionals believe that true objectivity in journalism is not possible and reporters must seek balance in their stories (giving all sides their respective points of view), which fosters fairness. Brent Cunningham suggests that reporters should understand their inevitable biases, so they can explore what the accepted narratives may be, and then work against these as much as possible. He points out that ‚Äú[w]e need deep reporting and real understanding, but we also need reporters to acknowledge all that they don't know, and not try to mask that shortcoming behind a gloss of attitude, or drown it in a roar of oversimplified assertions‚Äù. Cunningham suggests the following to solve the apparent controversies of objectivity: * Journalists should acknowledge, humbly and publicly, that what they do is far more subjective and far less detached than the aura of 'objectivity' implies. He proposes that this will not end the charges of bias, but rather allow journalists to defend what they do from a more realistic and less hypocritical position. * Journalists should be free and encouraged to develop expertise and to use it to sort through competing claims, identifying and explaining the underlying assumptions of those claims, and making judgments about what readers and viewers need to know and understand about what is happening. In the words of another scholar, Faina (2012) suggests that modern journalists may function as \\"sensemakers\\" within the shifting contemporary journalistic environment.Faina, J. (2012).

The application of this ‚Äúempirical‚Äù ‚Äúresearch‚Äù to the reporting of conflict may thus replace the ‚Äúunacknowledged‚Äù conventions (see above) which govern the ‚Äúnon-scientific‚Äù practices of 'objectivity' of journalism.  Crowdfunding  Recently, many scholars and journalists have increasingly become attuned to the shifts occurring within the newspaper industry, and general upheaval of the journalistic environment, as it adjusts to the new digital era of the 21st century.Hunter, Andrea (2014). \\"Crowdfunding independent and freelance journalism: Negotiating journalistic norms of autonomy and objectivity\\". new media & society. Sage. 17 (2): 272‚Äì288. In the face of this, the practice of crowdfunding is increasingly being utilized by journalists to fund independent and/or alternative projects, establishing it as another relevant alternative practice to consider in the discussion of journalistic objectivity. Crowdfunding allows journalists to pursue stories of interest to them or that otherwise may not be covered adequately for a number of reasons.Hunter, Andrea (2014). \\"Crowdfunding independent and freelance journalism: Negotiating journalistic norms of autonomy and objectivity\\". new media & society. Sage. 17 (2): 272‚Äì288. Crowdfunding supports journalists by funding necessary components like reporting equipment, computers, travel expenses if necessary, and overhead costs like office space or paying other staff on their team. A key component of crowdfunding and a significant motivator for journalists to use it is the lack of corporate backing. This means that the journalist has the autonomy to make editorial decisions at their sole discrection but there is equally no financial support. According to a study conducted by Hunter (2014), journalist's engaged in a crowdfunding campaign all held a similar opinion that their funders did not have control over the content and that it was the journalist who maintained ultimate jurisdiction. However, this pronouncement was complicated by the sense of accountability or responsibility incited in journalists towards their funders. Hunter (2014) notes that this may have the effect of creating a power imbalance between funders and the journalist, as journalists want to maintain editorial control, but it is in fact the funders that decide whether the project will be a success or not. To combat this, Hunter (2014) proposes the following strategies that journalists may employ to maintain a more objective approach if desired: * Constructing an imaginary 'firewall' between themselves and their audiences * Limiting investment from any single source * Clearly defining the relationship they desire with funders at the outset of the project The type of relationship and potential pressures the journalist may feel depends on the type of investor with whom they are working, as there are passive and active investors. Passive investors will not be involved beyond making a donation on the crowdfunding platform, leaving everything up to the discretion of the journalist. In contrast, active investors have a more active role in the production of the journalistic piece, which can take various forms that may include the investor providing feedback or ideas as well as receiving early copies of the work prior to its public release. Some journalists from the study firmly held the opinion that impartial accounts and a detached, namely \\"objective\\", reporting style should continue to govern, even within a crowdfunding context. Others, however, advocated that point-of-view journalism and accurate reporting are not mutually exclusive ideals, and thus journalists still may ascribe to quality factual reporting, sans the traditional practices or understanding of objectivity. As mentioned at the top of the article, objectivity is a centuries long practice associated with what is considered professional journalism. However, crowdfunding shows that there is a great deal of interest and support for journalism with a strong point of view. The study on crowdfunding done by Hunter (2014) showed that audiences are keen to fund projects with a specific point of view or pieces of advocacy journalism. Journalists are often using crowdfunding to pursue stories with a point-of- view that large corporations do not pursue adequately. The journalist explains the goal of the work they are trying to pursue and what resources are needed for it on crowdfunding platforms. Based on this information, funders decide to contribute or not. The desire or acceptance of opinionated journalism is especially clear with passive investors because they donate based on the journalist's pitch and let the journalist produce what they want. They essentially just want to support the journalist as an individual and allow them the freedom to pursue the project.

Topics widely cover the entire purview of all commercial activities related to the economy. This area of journalism provides news and feature articles about people, places and issues related to the business sector. Most newspapers, magazines, radio, and television-news shows include a business segment. Detailed and in-depth business journalism may appear in publications, radio, and television channels dedicated specifically to business and financial journalism.  History  Business journalism began as early as the Middle Ages, to help well-known trading families communicate with each other. Around 1700, Daniel Defoe--best known for his novels especially Robinson Crusoe-- began publishing business and economic news.Margarett A. James, and Dorothy F. Tucker. \\"Daniel Defoe, Journalist.\\" Business History Review 2.1 (1928): 2-6. In 1882 Charles Dow, Edward Jones and Charles Bergstresser began a wire service that delivered news to investment houses along Wall Street. And in 1889, The Wall Street Journal began publishing. While the famous muckraking journalist Ida Tarbell did not consider herself to be a business reporter, her reporting and writing about the Standard Oil Co. in 1902 provided the template for how thousands of business journalists have covered companies ever since. Business coverage gained prominence in the 1990s, with wider investment in the stock market. The Wall Street Journal is one prominent example of business journalism, and is among the United States of America's top newspapers in terms of both circulation and respect for the journalists whose work appears there.  Personnel  Journalists who work in this branch are classed as \\"business journalists\\". Their main task is to gather information about current events as they related to business. They may also cover processes, trends, consequences, and important people, in business and disseminate their work through all types of mass media.  Scope  Business journalism, although common in most industrialized countries, has a very limited role in third-world and developing countries. This leaves citizens of such countries in a very disadvantaged position locally and internationally. Recent efforts to bring business media to these countries have proven to be worthwhile.

The literal translation of the French title is Wasp's Nest. The film is quasi-remake of the 1976 film, Assault on Precinct 13, which in turn was inspired by 1959's Rio Bravo.All Movie Guide for Assault on Precinct 13 Plot  During Bastille Day when most people are enjoying the French national holiday, a group of thieves prepare to commit a warehouse robbery at a massive industrial park. Meanwhile, Laborie, a special agent in the French special forces, is leading an international team that is escorting the captured leader of the Albanian mafia, Abedin Nexhep, who is due in court on charges of running an extensive European prostitution network. Despite the considerable security escort, Nexhep's henchmen still manage to set up an ambush. Laborie manages to escape with Nexhep. They take refuge in the warehouse that is being robbed of computer equipment by the group of criminals. While facing off against the would-be thieves, the Albanian mafia surround the warehouse. Soon the three groups are involved in a long firefight with everyone involved struggling to survive.

C. Ohanian, J. T. Markert (2007), p. 3. or point-like particle, often spelled pointlike particle) is an idealization of particles heavily used in physics. Its defining feature is that it lacks spatial extension; being dimensionless, it does not take up space.F. E. Udwadia, R. E. Kalaba (2007), p. 1. A point particle is an appropriate representation of any object whenever its size, shape, and structure are irrelevant in a given context. For example, from far enough away, any finite- size object will look and behave as a point-like object. A point particle can also be referred in the case of a moving body in terms of physics. In the theory of gravity, physicists often discuss a ', meaning a point particle with a nonzero mass and no other properties or structure. Likewise, in electromagnetism, physicists discuss a ', a point particle with a nonzero charge.R. Snieder (2001), pp. 196‚Äì198. Sometimes, due to specific combinations of properties, extended objects behave as point-like even in their immediate vicinity. For example, spherical objects interacting in 3-dimensional space whose interactions are described by the inverse square law behave in such a way as if all their matter were concentrated in their centers of mass. In Newtonian gravitation and classical electromagnetism, for example, the respective fields outside a spherical object are identical to those of a point particle of equal charge/mass located at the center of the sphere.I. Newton, I. B Cohen, A. Whitmann (1999), p. 956 (Proposition 75, Theorem 35).I. Newton, A. Motte, J. Machin (1729), p. 270‚Äì271. In quantum mechanics, the concept of a point particle is complicated by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, because even an elementary particle, with no internal structure, occupies a nonzero volume. For example, the atomic orbit of an electron in the hydrogen atom occupies a volume of ~10‚àí30 m3. There is nevertheless a distinction between elementary particles such as electrons or quarks, which have no known internal structure, versus composite particles such as protons, which do have internal structure: A proton is made of three quarks. Elementary particles are sometimes called \\"point particles\\", but this is in a different sense than discussed above. Property concentrated at a single point When a point particle has an additive property, such as mass or charge, concentrated at a single point in space, this can be represented by a Dirac delta function. Physical point mass grid. The grey mass can be simplified to a point mass (the black circle). It becomes practical to represent point mass as small circle, or dot, as an actual point is invisible. Point mass (pointlike mass) is the concept, for example in classical physics, of a physical object (typically matter) that has nonzero mass, and yet explicitly and specifically is (or is being thought of or modeled as) infinitesimal (infinitely small) in its volume or linear dimensions. =Application= A common use for point mass lies in the analysis of the gravitational fields. When analyzing the gravitational forces in a system, it becomes impossible to account for every unit of mass individually. However, a spherically symmetric body affects external objects gravitationally as if all of its mass were concentrated at its center. Probability point mass A point mass in probability and statistics does not refer to mass in the sense of physics, but rather refers to a finite nonzero probability that is concentrated at a point in the probability mass distribution, where there is a discontinuous segment in a probability density function. To calculate such a point mass, an integration is carried out over the entire range of the random variable, on the probability density of the continuous part. After equating this integral to 1, the point mass can be found by further calculation. Point charge Scalar potential of a point charge shortly after exiting a dipole magnet, moving left to right. A point charge is an idealized model of a particle which has an electric charge. A point charge is an electric charge at a mathematical point with no dimensions. The fundamental equation of electrostatics is Coulomb's law, which describes the electric force between two point charges. The electric field associated with a classical point charge increases to infinity as the distance from the point charge decreases towards zero making energy (thus mass) of point charge infinite. Earnshaw's theorem states that a collection of point charges cannot be maintained in an equilibrium configuration solely by the electrostatic interaction of the charges. In quantum mechanics A proton is a combination of two up quarks and one down quark, held together by gluons. In quantum mechanics, there is a distinction between an elementary particle (also called \\"point particle\\") and a composite particle. An elementary particle, such as an electron, quark, or photon, is a particle with no internal structure. Whereas a composite particle, such as a proton or neutron, has an internal structure (see figure). However, neither elementary nor composite particles are spatially localized, because of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The particle wavepacket always occupies a nonzero volume. For example, see atomic orbital: The electron is an elementary particle, but its quantum states form three-dimensional patterns. Nevertheless, there is good reason that an elementary particle is often called a point particle. Even if an elementary particle has a delocalized wavepacket, the wavepacket can be represented as a quantum superposition of quantum states wherein the particle is exactly localized. Moreover, the interactions of the particle can be represented as a superposition of interactions of individual states which are localized. This is not true for a composite particle, which can never be represented as a superposition of exactly-localized quantum states. It is in this sense that physicists can discuss the intrinsic \\"size\\" of a particle: The size of its internal structure, not the size of its wavepacket. The \\"size\\" of an elementary particle, in this sense, is exactly zero. For example, for the electron, experimental evidence shows that the size of an electron is less than 10‚àí18 m. This is consistent with the expected value of exactly zero. (This should not be confused with the classical electron radius, which, despite the name, is unrelated to the actual size of an electron.)

In 1931, the new Stockholm Observatory (, 052), nicknamed \\"Saltis\\", was inaugurated on the Karlsbaderberget at Saltsj√∂baden, near Stockholm, and operated until 2001. There are records of daily weather observations from the observatory going back to 1754. The Stockholm Observatory site at Saltsj√∂baden was established with a 40 inch (102 cm) reflecting telescope from Grubb, built in 1931. Also of historical interest is a double telescope by Grubb, the 24/20-inch refractor, with has one 24-inch aperture another 20-inch on the same mount established in 1931. The old observatory is in modern times a museum (Observatory Museum) and because it is on a hill is known for a good view of city of Stockholm from the dome, and it also has some sculptures and walled garden. The old observatory has many items from across the centuries, including a Repsold telescope, and a marble inlaid meridian line. Many old observatory instruments involved determining the location of stars, the local time, and data was recorded manually. In the late 19th century astrophotography became more common, and the Replsold refractor is known to have been used for making images, which had to be done with chemicals that reacted with light (not with modern electronic devices).  History  The old observation room used before the top dome was built in the 19th century. The first observatory was established by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on the initiative of its secretary Per Elvius. Construction, according to designs by the architect Carl H√•rleman, begun in 1748 and the building was completed in 1753. It is situated on a hill in a park nowadays named Observatorielunden. The first head of the observatory was Pehr Wilhelm Wargentin. Later heads of the observatory include Hugo Gyld√©n and Bertil Lindblad. This 18th-century observatory today functions as a museum. A newer observatory was built in Saltsj√∂baden outside Stockholm and completed in 1931 (the architect this time being Axel Anderberg). More recent astronomical observations, however, are almost exclusively being done in observatories outside Sweden and closer to the equator. The research institute was transferred from the Academy to the university in 1973 and is since 2001 housed in the AlbaNova University Centre. The young Hjalmar Branting, later the first social democratic prime minister of Sweden, was employed as a mathematics assistant at the Stockholm Observatory 1879‚Äì1880 and 1882‚Äì1883.  Honors  In August 2000, the asteroid 36614 Saltis was discovered at the Stockholm Observatory. The asteroid was named after the nickname of the observatory's location, Saltsj√∂baden, by its discoverer Alexis Brandeker in 2003. 4043 Perlof is named after a director of the Stockholm Observatory, Per Olof Lindblad. Stockholm Observatory at Saltsj√∂baden The Grubb 40 inch aperture reflector during its manufacture in the 1920s. Telescopes of about 1 meter were popular at this time in the 20th century. It was common all over Europe for really old observatories to build in a new site, fortunately the old observatory was not torn down has happened in many cases. Then as the utility of the new sites also waned, the old site was revitalized. This happened similarly in England, where the Greenwich Observatory was moved to a new site in Sussex with new buildings, but then back to the old site again. One issue was the increased crowding in the cities, and also astronomy was growing more focused on data from space in the late 20th century. In any case the 40-inch (102 cm) reflector was one of the larger telescopes in the whole world for 1931, and is still a large and popular telescopes size even in the 21st century. The new observatory at Saltsj√∂baden More of the Saltsj√∂baden site Instruments Old astronomical items at the observatory Some first instruments for the observatory in the 1750s were two refractors and a small quadrant. Throughout the late 1700s the collection was increased, including a refractor from Dollond and various clocks. The clocks would be set by a device known as a transit instrument. Other activities at that time included trying determine distances in the solar system, observing comets, and observations of the Mira (aka Omicron Ceti). Of note the output of this star was recorded for thirty years by the observatory. Later instruments by the 19th century include a 7-inch Repsold refractor on an equatorial mount, which was noted to be used at the observatory for parallax observations of bright stars in 1884 edition of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.

The Khorramdin rebellion of Babak spread to the Western and Central parts of Iran and lasted more than twenty years before it was defeated when Babak was betrayed. Babak's uprising showed the continuing strength in Azerbaijan of ancestral Iranian local feelings.  Etymology  BƒÅbak () is a New Persian name meaning \\"father\\", which is derived from the Middle Persian PƒÅpak/PƒÅbag (ê≠Øê≠†ê≠Øê≠™ê≠©), a common name in pre-Islamic Iran and also the hereditary name of the Sasanian Empire, whose founder Ardashir I (), was the son of a prince named Pabag. The original name of Babak was al-Hasan.  Background  Azerbaijan in the 9th century. Babak was born in 795 (or 798) in Bilalabad in the Mimadh district of the Ardabil area, which was part of Azerbaijan, a region in north-western Iran. The Mimadh district had provided the Sasanian marzban (\\"margrave\\") of Ardabil with troops during the Muslim conquest of Iran in 633‚Äì654, which resulted in the fall of the Sasanians and the conquest of Azerbaijan. The region was briefly occupied by the Khazars in 730‚Äì731, and had since the mid 8th century been under colonization by the Arab Rawadid clan. Azerbaijan was populated by an Iranian people known as the Adhari, who although closely related, were distinct from the Persians. They spoke Adhari, which according to the 10th-century geographer al-Maqdisi, was similar to Persian. Babak was most likely himself not of pure Persian extraction, but of Adhari. His mother Mahru (meaning \\"Moon-Face\\") was a non- Muslim wet-nurse from Azerbaijan. She is described as being \\"one-eyed\\" in Muslim sources and furthermore, by Al-Tabari, as having become pregnant with her son after being raped by a mercenary. However, these stories are more than likely fabrications created by hostile authors in order to disgrace Babak. As for the identity Babak's father, there are also multiple conflicting accounts. Al-Waqidi, as quoted by Ibn Al-Nadim, states that he was an oil-seller from al-Mada'in (Ctesiphon), who had settled in Azerbaijan. Crone takes this to mean that he was of Aramean origin. However, Dinawari, a contemporary of Babak, concludes and states that there is ample evidence to support that his father's true name was Mutahar, a descendant of Abu Muslim through his daughter, FƒÅ·π≠ema. C.E. Bosworth argues that more credence should be lent to this latter account, as other sources are hostile and are eager to propose lowly or otherwise less honorable origins for Babak. In the other sources, his name is variably given as Abdallah, Merdas, Matar, Amir ibn Abdallah, or Amir ibn Ahad, all which suggest that he was seemingly a Muslim. Likewise, Babak's father is also the subject of derogatory fabrication in Muslim sources. Masudi noted in his ‚Ä≥Mur≈´j al-dhahab wa ma øƒÅdin al-jawƒÅhir‚Ä≥: ‚Ä≥What seems to us to be true and proven is that BƒÅbak was a son of Mo·π≠ahhar, the son of Ab≈´ Moslem‚Äôs daughter FƒÅ·π≠ema, and that the FƒÅ·π≠emƒ´ya group of the ·∏¥orramƒ´s took their name from this FƒÅ·π≠ema, not from FƒÅ·π≠ema the daughter of God‚Äôs Prophet‚Ä≥. The original faith of Babak is uncertain; he was born with the Muslim name of al-Hasan, and his three brothers, Mu'awiya, Abdallah, and Ishaq, also had Muslim names. Having Muslim name is not in itself proof of any religious beliefs, as it was not uncommon for people to have an Muslim name in order \\"to move freely in Muslim society by virtue of their high position in their own community, such as the Armenian princes\\" (Crone). According to Crone, who follows Al-Waqidi, Babak's parents were probably no more than landless villagers, but knew that Babak and his brothers' futures lay with the Arab warlords of Azerbaijan, and thus as a way of \\"adapting to the standards of new the world,\\" raised them as Muslims.  Early life  During Babak's youth, his travelling father was killed near Sabalan. Till the age of twelve, Babak worked as a cowherd, and afterwards entered the service of an Arab warlord named Shibl ibn al-Muthanna al-Azdi in Sarab, where he worked as a groom and servant. The ghilman (\\"slaves\\") of Shibl taught Babak how to play the lute. Babak also learned to recite poetry, probably in the local Adhari dialect. According to the 11th- century writer Abu'l Ma'ali, Babak played the lute and sang songs for the locals whilst working as a fruit vendor in the village. Babak later established himself in the city of Tabriz. There he worked under another Arab warlord, Muhammad ibn Rawwad Azdi for two years, until he reached adulthood and left for his village, Bilalabad. There Babak encountered a wealthy and influential landlord named Javidhan, who was reportedly impressed with the latters cleverness, and as result recruited him into his service. Unlike the previous men Babak had served, Javidhan was a local Iranian, and the leader of one of the two Khurramite movements in Azerbaijan. The leader of the other Khurramite movement was a certain Abu Imran, who often clashed with Javidhans forces. During one of the clashes, Abu Imran was defeated and killed, whilst Javidhan was mortally wounded, dying three days later. Javidhan was succeeded by Babak, who had already converted to Khurramism under the latters service. It was most probably during this period that Babak changed his name from al- Hasan to Babak.

Although he had helped the Abbasids to defeat the former Caliphs, the Umayyad dynasty, the ruling Caliph had given the order to kill him, probably because of his increasing popularity among Iranians and non-Muslims. Many Iranians, who had expected more freedom and more rights from the new rulers, could not believe that their hero was killed by the ruling Caliph whom they had considered a friend of Iran and Iranians.CAIS News, Restoration of Fortress of Babak Khorramdin to Continue, May 16, 2004. This incident led to many revolts, mostly by angry Khurramiyyah (Khorram-DinƒÅn) and some Zoroastrians. This, in turn, forced the Caliphs to use more violence against the Iranian population in order to keep the eastern provinces under control. The constant revolts did not come to an end in the following decades, and the Iranian population of the Caliphate was constantly being oppressed. Babak joined the Khurramiyyah (Khorram-DinƒÅn). The story of joining the Khorrami movement is being told in Waqed's account, in summary, as follows: Under the direction of his mentor Javidhan, a leader of one of the sects of the Khorramdin, Babak's knowledge of history, geography, and the latest battle tactics strengthened his position as a favorite candidate for commander during the early wars against the Arab occupiers. BƒÅbak was a highly spiritual person who respected his Zoroastrian heritage. He made every possible effort to bring Iranians together and also with leaders such as Maziar to form a united front against the Arab Caliph. According to the medieval historian, Ibn Esfandyar, who composed the book Tarikh-e Tabaristan (History of Tabaristan), Maziar said: However, one of the most dramatic periods in the history of Iran was set under BƒÅbak's leadership between 816‚Äì837. During these most crucial years, they not only fought against the Caliphate, but also for the preservation of Persian language and culture. After the death of Javidhan, Babak married Javidhan's wife and became the Khorramis' leader, sometime in the year 816‚Äì17 during al-Ma'mun's reign. Babak incited his followers to rebel against the caliphate. According to Vladimir Minorsky, around the 9th‚Äì10th century:V. Minorsky, Studies in Caucasian History, Cambridge University Press, 1957, p. 112 At that time of Babak, there were Khorramis scattered in many regions of Iran, besides Adharbayjan, reportedly in Tabarestan, Khorasan, Balkh, Isfahan, Kashan, Qom, Ray, Karaj, Hamadan, Lorestan, Khuzestan as well as in Basra, and Armenia. Tabari records that Babak claimed he possessed Javadan's spirit and that Babak became active in 816‚Äì817. In 819‚Äì820 Yahya ibn Mu'adh fought against Babak, but could not defeat him. Two years later Babak vanquished the forces of Isa ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Khalid. In 824‚Äì825 the caliphal general Ahmad ibn al Junayd was sent against Babak. Babak defeated and captured him. In 827‚Äì828 Muhammad ibn Humayd Tusi was dispatched to fight Babak. He won a victory and sent some captured enemy, but not Babak, to al-Ma'mun. However, about two years later, on June 9, 829, Babak won a decisive victory over this general at Hashtadsar. Muhammad ibn Humayd lost his life. Many of his soldiers were killed. The survivors fled in disarray. Babak's victories over Arab generals were associated with his possession of Badd fort and inaccessible mountain stronghold according to the Arab historians who mentioned that his influence also extended even to the territories of today's Azerbaijan - ‚Ä≥southward to near Ardabil and Marand, eastward to the Caspian Sea and the Shamakhi district and Shervan, northward to the Muqan (Mo·∏°an) steppe and the Aras river bank, westward to the districts of Jolfa, Nakjavan, and Marand‚Äù. In 835‚Äì836 the caliph al-Mu'tasim sent his outstanding general Afshin against Babak. Afshin rebuilt fortresses. He employed a relay system to protect supply caravans. Babak tried to capture the money being sent to pay Afshin's army, but was himself surprised, lost many men and barely escaped. He did succeed in capturing some supplies and inflicting some hardship on his enemies. Amongst Babak's commander, various names have been mentioned including Azin, Rostam, Tarkhan, Mua‚Äôwiyah and Abdullah.Said Nafisi, Babak Khorramdin Delawar-e-Azerbaijan [Babak Khorramdin, the brave-heart of Azerbaijan], Tehran: Tabesh, 1955 The next year Babak routed the forces of Afshin's subordinate, Bugha al-Kabir. In 837‚Äì838 al- Mu'tasim reinforced Afshin and provided him clear military instructions. Patiently following these enabled Afshin to capture Babak's stronghold of Badhdh. Babak escaped. Al-Mu'tasim sent a safety guarantee for Babak to Afshin. This was taken to Babak who was very displeased. He said: \\"Better to live for just a single day as a ruler than to live for forty years as an abject slave.\\" He decided to leave the country for the Byzantine Empire and on his way Babak met Sahl Smbatean (Sahl ibn Sunbat in Arab sources), Prince of Khachen, who was Armenian due to the Armenian historiography and Caucasian Albanian due to the Adharbayjani historiography. Sahl Smbatian, however, handed Babak over to Afshin in return for a large reward. Al-Mu'tasim commanded his general to bring Babak to him. Afshin informed Babak of this and told him since Babak might never return, this was the time to take a last look around. At Babak's request, Afshin allowed his prisoner to go to Badhdh. There Babak walked through his ruined stronghold one night until dawn. Eventually, BƒÅbak, his wife, and his warriors were forced to leave Ghaleye BƒÅbak after 23 years of constant campaigns.  Death  He was eventually betrayed by Afshin and was handed over to the Abbasid Caliph. During BƒÅbak's execution, the Caliph's henchmen first cut off his legs and hands in order to convey the most devastating message to his followers. The legend says that BƒÅbak bravely rinsed his face with the drained blood pouring out of his cuts, thus depriving the Caliph and the rest of the Abbasid army from seeing his pale face, a result of the heavy loss of blood.CAIS News, Restoration of Fortress of Babak Khorramdin to Continue, May 16, 2004 He was then gibbeted alive whilst sewn into a cow's skin with the horns at ear level to gradually crush his head as it dried out.The golden age of Islam by Maurice Lombard, page 152, ,  Legacy  Babak Khorramdin was not well known outside academia until the 20th century; however, due to Soviet nation building efforts and Babak's following of teaching of Mazdak with its proto-socialist themes, Babak Khorramdin was proclaimed a national hero in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. For example, the Soviet era scholar Ziya Bunyadov, claimed that \\"Babak was a national hero of Azerbaijani people\\" while the Russian ethnologist, historian and anthropologist Victor Schnirelmann dismisses Bunyadov's theory, criticizing Bunyadov for not mentioning that Babak spoke Persian, and ignoring the witness accounts of Babak's contemporaries who call him Persian.Shnirelman, V. A. (2001), The value of the Past: Myths, Identity and Politics in Transcaucasia, Osaka: National Museum of Ethnology. pp 123: \\"Having claimed that, Buniiatov failed to mention that Babek spoke Persian, and ignored the witnesses of contemporaries who called him the 'Persian.

In modern Iran, due to the rise of nationalism in the 20th century, and renewed interest in pre-Islamic Iran, Babak Khorramdin was rediscovered during the reign of Reza Shah, and is celebrated as a national hero.Michael M.

This program was undertaken in close collaboration with Egypt, and then Iraq (the Iraqi version was called BADR-2000), however it was discontinued in the early 1990s by President Carlos Menem because of political pressure from the United States.

Modern usage from the 1960s has come to refer to elastic close-fitting garments worn over the legs typically by women, such as leg warmers or tights. Usage from the 18th century refers to men's wear, usually made of cloth or leather that is wrapped around the leg down to the ankle. In the 19th century, leggings usually referred to infants' leg clothing that were matched with a jacket, as well as leg- wrappings made of leather or wool and worn by soldiers and trappers. Leggings prominently returned to women's fashion in the 1960s, drawing from the form- fitting clothing of dancers. With the widespread adoption of the synthetic fibre Lycra and the rise in popularity of aerobics, leggings came to further prominence in the 1970s and '80s, and eventually made their way into streetwear. Leggings are a part of the late 2010s athleisure fashion trend of wearing activewear outside sporting activities and in casual settings, which became a contentious social norm in the United States. History Comanche- Cheyenne wearing leggings, Ledger drawing Leggings in various forms and under various names have been worn for warmth and protection by both men and women throughout the centuries. The separate hose worn by men in Europe from the 13th to 16th centuries (the Renaissance period) were a form of leggings, as are the trews of the Scottish Highlands. Separate leggings of buckskin leather were worn by some Native Americans. These were adopted by some Long Hunters, French fur trappers, and later by mountain men. They are the leatherstockings of James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales. The Buckskins were mostly a dull grey brain-tan, not the bright, glossy vegetable tanned leather commonly used today. Cowboys wore leggings of buckskin to protect from chapping caused by riding, wear and tear to their pants, and bites from animals, such as snakes or insects in the scrub, such as ticks. In many places, especially in colder countries such as Russia and Korea, men and women continued to wear wool leggings into modern times, often as an additional outer layer for warmth. The linen pantalettes worn by girls and women under crinolines in the mid-19th century were also a form of leggings, and were originally two separate garments. Leggings became a part of fashion in the 1960s, as trousers similar to capri pants but tighter. =Military use= An American soldier wearing puttees in France, c. 1918 Since the late 19th century, soldiers of various nations, especially infantry, often wore leggings to protect their lower leg, to keep dirt, sand, and mud from entering their shoes, and to provide a measure of ankle support. At first, these were usually puttees‚Äîstrips of thick woolen cloth resembling a large bandage‚Äîwhich were wrapped around the leg to support the ankle. They were usually held in place by a strap attached to the cloth. Later, puttees were replaced by some armies with canvas leggings fastened with buckles or buttons, usually secured at the bottom with an adjustable stirrup that passed under the sole of the shoe, just in front of the heel. The soldier placed the leggings around his calf with the buttoned side facing out and adjusted them and the strap to achieve a proper fit. Leggings typically extended to mid-calf and had a garter strap to hold them up and were secured with a tie just below the knee. Military leggings extended to the bottom of the knee and buttoned to the bottom button on the knee-breeches. They are sometimes confused with gaiters, which extend to the high ankle and are worn with full leg trousers. During World War II, United States Army foot soldiers were referred to as legs by paratroopers and other U.S. forces that did not wear the standard Army leggings issued with the field service shoe. Late in World War II, after experiments with general issue of high-top combat boots and jump boots for soldiers, leggings began to disappear from military service. In 1943, the United States Army modified their field service shoe by adding a taller leather upper that reached to the lower calf; secured by a combination of laces and buckles, the new design was designated the Type III Field Boot. However, the United States Marine Corps retained canvas leggings throughout the war, and used them in combat as late as the Korean War; Marines were referred to as Yellow Leg troops by North Korean and Chinese Communist forces. By the 1960s, the old style of field shoe had given way to combat boots in most military forces, and leggings of any kind were obsolete. Leggings, usually bright white and often made of patent leather or buff are now worn primarily for ceremonial purposes. Modern fashion A woman wearing white leggings with a floral design Leggings in the form of skin-tight trousers, a tighter version of the capris ending at mid-calf or near ankle length, made their way into women's fashion in the 1960s, and were worn with a large belt or waistband and slip-on high heels or ballet flat‚Äìstyled shoes. Leggings made from a nylon-lycra blend (usually 90% nylon, 10% lycra) have long been worn during exercise. Nylon lycra leggings are often referred to as bicycle or running tights, and are shinier in appearance than those made from cotton. Some have racing stripes or reflective patterns to further distinguish them as athletic wear and provide extra safety. However, since the 1980s exercise-style leggings have also been worn for fashion and as street wear. Leggings made from cotton-lycra, or a cotton-polyester-lycra combination, are more typically worn for fashion, but are also worn as exercise wear. Cotton-lycra leggings are available in many colors, prints and designs; but black, navy and various shades of gray remain the most commonly worn. Wearing black leggings under long, often diaphanous, skirts was part of a general fashion trend of wearing gym or dance clothes as street wear that evolved along with the fitness craze and under the influence of the movie Flashdance and the long-running Broadway show A Chorus Line. A more recent trend has been the wearing of black leggings with miniskirts. By the early-1990s, leggings were actually outselling jeans in many parts of the United States. It was very common to see leggings worn with long oversized tee-shirts, oversized sweatshirts or oversized sweaters, slouch socks and Keds by girls from toddler to over college age. Fashion turned against leggings for a short time in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In 2005, leggings made a \\"comeback\\" into fashion, particularly in indie culture, with capri-length leggings being worn with mini skirts and dresses. Consequently, leggings are also now popular to wear with oversized, long sweaters, denim mini skirts, plaid skirts, short dresses and short shorts. Leggings are also worn under athletic shorts i.e. Nike Tempo shorts especially in colder weather. Leggings also come in capri length and bike short length. The bike short length is popular under sports uniform shorts and under skirts and dresses as a fashionable item and to keep from showing too much. =For men= At the Marni Men's show during the Fall 2007 Fashion Week, outfits with leggings designed solely for men were introduced. Men's leggings, dubbed \\"meggings\\" (a portmanteau of the words \\"men\\" and \\"leggings\\") were presented as the latest fashion trend for men at spring/summer 2011 fashion runways, supposed to be styled and layered beneath shorts and preferably with large, baggy, loose or long tops such as T-shirts. K-pop idols have been wearing male leggings under shorts as a fashion item since the 2010s. =Shiny leggings= catwalk. Shiny leggings, sometimes called leather-look leggings, have a shiny, metallic (lam√©), or wet-like appearance. They emerged as a popular fashion trend in the late-2000s (decade), particularly in 2008 as reported by Stylesignal and other trend forecasters. These leggings are most often a blend of nylon and spandex and come in a variety of colors, although most commonly in black, silver, or gold. These types of leggings are notable for their leather, or even latex appearance and are most often worn as evening or clubwear. Shiny leggings were featured on fashion runways by many leading designers and were further popularized by celebrities such as Lauren Conrad, Kelly Clarkson and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. Popular makers of shiny leggings include Members Only and American Apparel. =Jeggings= \\"Jeggings\\", a registered brand name of Sanko Group, are leggings made to look like skin-tight denim jeans. Jeggings were brought on by the resurgence in style of skinny jeans in the late 2000s, when a higher demand for an even tighter style of pants came about. In 2011 \\"Jeggings\\" was entered into the twelfth edition of Concise Oxford English Dictionary. =In sports= Leggings are sometimes worn during sports and other vigorous activities. Runners, dancers, and exercisers may wear them alone or with athletic shorts over them‚Äîparticularly in cold weather under a sports uniform, e.g. in soccer, with soccer shorts, shin guards and soccer socks over the leggings, or under a cheerleading uniform with socks over the leggings. Leggings have even been worn by a hurling full back. = In school uniforms = Leggings have become a part of many school uniforms. Many schools that have uniform requirements allow leggings as an option in cooler and colder weather as long as the required skirt or dress and required socks are worn over them. =Use as outerwear= There has been societal debate about whether leggings are clothing on their own, which can be worn without covering, or are an accessory only to be worn with other items covering them, such as skirts, dresses or shorts. In a 2016 poll of its readers Glamour magazine said that 61% of its readers thought that leggings should only be worn as an accessory,Clinton, Leah Melby (March 22, 2016) \\"We Asked, You Answered: Should Leggings Be Worn as Pants?\\" Glamour. whereas an article that same year from Good Housekeeping concluded that \\"...Leggings do, in fact, count as pants‚Äîprovided they are opaque enough that they don't show your underwear.\\"Escobar, Sam (October 13, 2016) \\"Are Leggings Pants?

In fact, in recent IBM Z machines IFLs support simultaneous multithreading, a feature not available for general purpose processors. IBM announced IFLs on August 1, 2000, and started shipping them on September 29, 2000. At the same time, IBM introduced a special Linux-only, VM- like product called the S/390 Virtual Image Facility for Linux to cater to IT staff previously unfamiliar with IBM mainframes.IBM U.S. Announcement Letter 200-261. IBM soon discovered that z/VM was not too difficult for new IT staff to learn (and worked better), so IBM withdrew S/390 Virtual Image Facility for Linux from marketing on April 30, 2002.IBM U.S. Announcement Letter 901-307. Customers could purchase IFLs for all IBM mainframes as far back as the G5 series and can purchase IFLs for all recent IBM Z and LinuxONE machine models. IFLs also support select IBM software appliances such as the IBM Db2 Analytics Accelerator, zAware, and z/VSE Network Appliance, and they also supported the Z port of the now abandoned OpenSolaris operating system. Fujitsu and Hitachi also offered IFLs on certain models of their machines. On Power Systems IFLs are also specially priced for both the processors and many software products.

It is part of the XIII Conference Region and includes 113 parishes, 307 priests, and an estimated 550,000 lay Catholics. The seat of the archdiocese is the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception at 401 East Colfax Avenue. History The area that now comprises the Denver Archdiocese was part of the Diocese of Santa Fe. In 1868, Pope Pius IX split territory from the Diocese of Santa Fe in New Mexico and the Diocese of Grass Valley in California to form the Vicariate Apostolic of Colorado and Utah. In 1870, he changed the name to the Vicariate Apostolic of Colorado, and transferred the territory of Utah to the Archdiocese of San Francisco. August 16, 1887, Pope Leo XIII created the Diocese of Denver, which covered the entire state of Colorado. On November 15, 1941, Pope Pius XII separated territory from the Diocese of Denver to form the Diocese of Pueblo and elevated the Denver Diocese to an archdiocese. On November 10, 1983, Pope John Paul II separated territory from both the Archdiocese of Denver and the Diocese of Pueblo to form the Diocese of Colorado Springs. On May 29, 2012, Pope Benedict XVI named Bishop Samuel Joseph Aquila of the Diocese of Fargo, North Dakota as fifth archbishop of Denver. Bishop James Conley served as Apostolic Administrator of the Archdiocese from the departure of Archbishop Charles J. Chaput in September 2011 until the new Archbishop was installed July 18, 2012, at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. =Reports of sex abuse= In 1996, Father John Stein, who was arrested for sex abuse charges in 1956, settled a sex abuse lawsuit on terms which were confidential. The man suing Stein accused Stein of molesting him hundreds of times over a three year period starting in 1953. Stein, who died in 2001, also had two other accusers as well. On October 23, 2019, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser released the results of an eight month investigation revealing that 43 Catholic clergy were credibly accused of sexually abusing at least 166 children throughout the state of Colorado since 1950. At least 127 of these children were molested by 22 clergy serving in the Archdiocese of Denver. The report also criticized Archdiocese's handling of cases involving Father Harold Robert White, who was referred to as \\"the most prolific known clergy child sex abuser in Colorado history.\\" White, who was first accused of sex abuse in 1960, was transferred to different parishes throughout Colorado and was accused of sexually abusing 63 children. He was not permanently removed from ministry until 1993 and died in 2006. On October 16, 2020, it was revealed that all three of Colorado's Catholic Dioceses, including the Archdiocese of Denver, had paid $6.6 million in compensation to 81 victims of clergy sex abuse within the past year, regardless of how long ago the abuse happened.

Some of the ways by which crystals form are precipitating from a solution, freezing, or more rarely deposition directly from a gas. Attributes of the resulting crystal depend largely on factors such as temperature, air pressure, and in the case of liquid crystals, time of fluid evaporation. Crystallization occurs in two major steps. The first is nucleation, the appearance of a crystalline phase from either a supercooled liquid or a supersaturated solvent. The second step is known as crystal growth, which is the increase in the size of particles and leads to a crystal state. An important feature of this step is that loose particles form layers at the crystal's surface and lodge themselves into open inconsistencies such as pores, cracks, etc. The majority of minerals and organic molecules crystallize easily, and the resulting crystals are generally of good quality, i.e. without visible defects. However, larger biochemical particles, like proteins, are often difficult to crystallize. The ease with which molecules will crystallize strongly depends on the intensity of either atomic forces (in the case of mineral substances), intermolecular forces (organic and biochemical substances) or intramolecular forces (biochemical substances). Crystallization is also a chemical solid‚Äìliquid separation technique, in which mass transfer of a solute from the liquid solution to a pure solid crystalline phase occurs. In chemical engineering, crystallization occurs in a crystallizer. Crystallization is therefore related to precipitation, although the result is not amorphous or disordered, but a crystal.  Process  Time- lapse of growth of a citric acid crystal. The video covers an area of 2.0 by 1.5 mm and was captured over 7.2 min. The crystallization process consists of two major events, nucleation and crystal growth which are driven by thermodynamic properties as well as chemical properties. In crystallization Nucleation is the step where the solute molecules or atoms dispersed in the solvent start to gather into clusters, on the microscopic scale (elevating solute concentration in a small region), that become stable under the current operating conditions. These stable clusters constitute the nuclei. Therefore, the clusters need to reach a critical size in order to become stable nuclei. Such critical size is dictated by many different factors (temperature, supersaturation, etc.). It is at the stage of nucleation that the atoms or molecules arrange in a defined and periodic manner that defines the crystal structure ‚Äî note that \\"crystal structure\\" is a special term that refers to the relative arrangement of the atoms or molecules, not the macroscopic properties of the crystal (size and shape), although those are a result of the internal crystal structure. The crystal growth is the subsequent size increase of the nuclei that succeed in achieving the critical cluster size. Crystal growth is a dynamic process occurring in equilibrium where solute molecules or atoms precipitate out of solution, and dissolve back into solution. Supersaturation is one of the driving forces of crystallization, as the solubility of a species is an equilibrium process quantified by Ksp. Depending upon the conditions, either nucleation or growth may be predominant over the other, dictating crystal size. Many compounds have the ability to crystallize with some having different crystal structures, a phenomenon called polymorphism. Certain polymorphs may be metastable, meaning that although it is not in thermodynamic equilibrium, it is kinetically stable and requires some input of energy to initiate a transformation to the equilibrium phase. Each polymorph is in fact a different thermodynamic solid state and crystal polymorphs of the same compound exhibit different physical properties, such as dissolution rate, shape (angles between facets and facet growth rates), melting point, etc. For this reason, polymorphism is of major importance in industrial manufacture of crystalline products. Additionally, crystal phases can sometimes be interconverted by varying factors such as temperature, such as in the transformation of anatase to rutile phases of titanium dioxide.  In nature  Snowflakes are a very well-known example, where subtle differences in crystal growth conditions result in different geometries. Crystallized honey There are many examples of natural process that involve crystallization. Geological time scale process examples include: * Natural (mineral) crystal formation (see also gemstone); * Stalactite/stalagmite, rings formation; Human time scale process examples include: * Snow flakes formation; * Honey crystallization (nearly all types of honey crystallize).  Methods  Crystal formation can be divided into two types, where the first type of crystals are composed of a cation and anion, also known as a salt, such as sodium acetate. The second type of crystals are composed of uncharged species, for example menthol. Crystal formation can be achieved by various methods, such as: cooling, evaporation, addition of a second solvent to reduce the solubility of the solute (technique known as antisolvent or drown-out), solvent layering, sublimation, changing the cation or anion, as well as other methods. The formation of a supersaturated solution does not guarantee crystal formation, and often a seed crystal or scratching the glass is required to form nucleation sites. A typical laboratory technique for crystal formation is to dissolve the solid in a solution in which it is partially soluble, usually at high temperatures to obtain supersaturation. The hot mixture is then filtered to remove any insoluble impurities. The filtrate is allowed to slowly cool. Crystals that form are then filtered and washed with a solvent in which they are not soluble, but is miscible with the mother liquor. The process is then repeated to increase the purity in a technique known as recrystallization. For biological molecules in which the solvent channels continue to be present to retain the three dimensional structure intact, microbatch crystallization under oil and vapor diffusion methods have been the common methods. = Typical equipment = Equipment for the main industrial processes for crystallization. #Tank crystallizers. Tank crystallization is an old method still used in some specialized cases. Saturated solutions, in tank crystallization, are allowed to cool in open tanks. After a period of time the mother liquor is drained and the crystals removed. Nucleation and size of crystals are difficult to control. Typically, labor costs are very high.  Thermodynamic view  SEM magnification series for a snow crystal. The crystals are captured, stored, and sputter-coated with platinum at cryo- temperatures for imaging. The crystallization process appears to violate the second principle of thermodynamics. Whereas most processes that yield more orderly results are achieved by applying heat, crystals usually form at lower temperatures‚Äîespecially by supercooling. However, due to the release of the heat of fusion during crystallization, the entropy of the universe increases, thus this principle remains unaltered. The molecules within a pure, perfect crystal, when heated by an external source, will become liquid. This occurs at a sharply defined temperature (different for each type of crystal). As it liquifies, the complicated architecture of the crystal collapses. Melting occurs because the entropy (S) gain in the system by spatial randomization of the molecules has overcome the enthalpy (H) loss due to breaking the crystal packing forces: :T(S_\\\\text{liquid} - S_\\\\text{solid}) > H_\\\\text{liquid} - H_\\\\text{solid}, :G_\\\\text{liquid} < G_\\\\text{solid}. Regarding crystals, there are no exceptions to this rule. Similarly, when the molten crystal is cooled, the molecules will return to their crystalline form once the temperature falls beyond the turning point. This is because the thermal randomization of the surroundings compensates for the loss of entropy that results from the reordering of molecules within the system. Such liquids that crystallize on cooling are the exception rather than the rule. The nature of a crystallization process is governed by both thermodynamic and kinetic factors, which can make it highly variable and difficult to control. Factors such as impurity level, mixing regime, vessel design, and cooling profile can have a major impact on the size, number, and shape of crystals produced. Dynamics As mentioned above, a crystal is formed following a well-defined pattern, or structure, dictated by forces acting at the molecular level. As a consequence, during its formation process the crystal is in an environment where the solute concentration reaches a certain critical value, before changing status. Solid formation, impossible below the solubility threshold at the given temperature and pressure conditions, may then take place at a concentration higher than the theoretical solubility level. The difference between the actual value of the solute concentration at the crystallization limit and the theoretical (static) solubility threshold is called supersaturation and is a fundamental factor in crystallization. =Nucleation= Nucleation is the initiation of a phase change in a small region, such as the formation of a solid crystal from a liquid solution. It is a consequence of rapid local fluctuations on a molecular scale in a homogeneous phase that is in a state of metastable equilibrium. Total nucleation is the sum effect of two categories of nucleation ‚Äì primary and secondary. Primary nucleation Primary nucleation is the initial formation of a crystal where there are no other crystals present or where, if there are crystals present in the system, they do not have any influence on the process. This can occur in two conditions. The first is homogeneous nucleation, which is nucleation that is not influenced in any way by solids. These solids include the walls of the crystallizer vessel and particles of any foreign substance. The second category, then, is heterogeneous nucleation. This occurs when solid particles of foreign substances cause an increase in the rate of nucleation that would otherwise not be seen without the existence of these foreign particles. Homogeneous nucleation rarely occurs in practice due to the high energy necessary to begin nucleation without a solid surface to catalyse the nucleation. Primary nucleation (both homogeneous and heterogeneous) has been modelled with the following:Tavare, N. S. (1995). Industrial Crystallization. Plenum Press, New York. :B = \\\\dfrac{dN}{dt} = k_n(c - c^*)^n, where : B is the number of nuclei formed per unit volume per unit time, : N is the number of nuclei per unit volume, : kn is a rate constant, : c is the instantaneous solute concentration, : c* is the solute concentration at saturation, : (c ‚àí c*) is also known as supersaturation, : n is an empirical exponent that can be as large as 10, but generally ranges between 3 and 4. Secondary nucleation Secondary nucleation is the formation of nuclei attributable to the influence of the existing microscopic crystals in the magma.McCabe & Smith (2000). Unit Operations of Chemical Engineering. McGraw-Hill, New York. Simply put, secondary nucleation is when crystal growth is initiated with contact of other existing crystals or \\"seeds\\". The first type of known secondary crystallization is attributable to fluid shear, the other due to collisions between already existing crystals with either a solid surface of the crystallizer or with other crystals themselves. Fluid-shear nucleation occurs when liquid travels across a crystal at a high speed, sweeping away nuclei that would otherwise be incorporated into a crystal, causing the swept-away nuclei to become new crystals. Contact nucleation has been found to be the most effective and common method for nucleation. The benefits include the following: * Low kinetic order and rate- proportional to supersaturation, allowing easy control without unstable operation. * Occurs at low supersaturation, where growth rate is optimal for good quality. * Low necessary energy at which crystals strike avoids the breaking of existing crystals into new crystals. * The quantitative fundamentals have already been isolated and are being incorporated into practice. The following model, although somewhat simplified, is often used to model secondary nucleation: :B = \\\\dfrac{dN}{dt} = k_1 M_T^j(c - c^*)^b, where : k1 is a rate constant, : MT is the suspension density, : j is an empirical exponent that can range up to 1.5, but is generally 1, : b is an empirical exponent that can range up to 5, but is generally 2. Crystal growth =Growth= Once the first small crystal, the nucleus, forms it acts as a convergence point (if unstable due to supersaturation) for molecules of solute touching ‚Äì or adjacent to ‚Äì the crystal so that it increases its own dimension in successive layers. The pattern of growth resembles the rings of an onion, as shown in the picture, where each colour indicates the same mass of solute; this mass creates increasingly thin layers due to the increasing surface area of the growing crystal. The supersaturated solute mass the original nucleus may capture in a time unit is called the growth rate expressed in kg/(m2*h), and is a constant specific to the process. Growth rate is influenced by several physical factors, such as surface tension of solution, pressure, temperature, relative crystal velocity in the solution, Reynolds number, and so forth. The main values to control are therefore: *Supersaturation value, as an index of the quantity of solute available for the growth of the crystal; *Total crystal surface in unit fluid mass, as an index of the capability of the solute to fix onto the crystal; *Retention time, as an index of the probability of a molecule of solute to come into contact with an existing crystal; *Flow pattern, again as an index of the probability of a molecule of solute to come into contact with an existing crystal (higher in laminar flow, lower in turbulent flow, but the reverse applies to the probability of contact). The first value is a consequence of the physical characteristics of the solution, while the others define a difference between a well- and poorly designed crystallizer. =Size distribution= The appearance and size range of a crystalline product is extremely important in crystallization. If further processing of the crystals is desired, large crystals with uniform size are important for washing, filtering, transportation, and storage, because large crystals are easier to filter out of a solution than small crystals. Also, larger crystals have a smaller surface area to volume ratio, leading to a higher purity. This higher purity is due to less retention of mother liquor which contains impurities, and a smaller loss of yield when the crystals are washed to remove the mother liquor. In special cases, for example during drug manufacturing in the pharmaceutical industry, small crystal sizes are often desired to improve drug dissolution rate and bio-availability. The theoretical crystal size distribution can be estimated as a function of operating conditions with a fairly complicated mathematical process called population balance theory (using population balance equations). Main crystallization processes right Some of the important factors influencing solubility are: * Concentration * Temperature * Solvent mixture composition * Polarity * Ionic strength So one may identify two main families of crystallization processes: * Cooling crystallization * Evaporative crystallization This division is not really clear-cut, since hybrid systems exist, where cooling is performed through evaporation, thus obtaining at the same time a concentration of the solution. A crystallization process often referred to in chemical engineering is the fractional crystallization. This is not a different process, rather a special application of one (or both) of the above. =Cooling crystallization= Application Most chemical compounds, dissolved in most solvents, show the so-called direct solubility that is, the solubility threshold increases with temperature. Solubility of the system Na2SO4 ‚Äì H2O So, whenever the conditions are favorable, crystal formation results from simply cooling the solution. Here cooling is a relative term: austenite crystals in a steel form well above 1000 ¬∞C. An example of this crystallization process is the production of Glauber's salt, a crystalline form of sodium sulfate. In the diagram, where equilibrium temperature is on the x-axis and equilibrium concentration (as mass percent of solute in saturated solution) in y-axis, it is clear that sulfate solubility quickly decreases below 32.5 ¬∞C. Assuming a saturated solution at 30 ¬∞C, by cooling it to 0 ¬∞C (note that this is possible thanks to the freezing-point depression), the precipitation of a mass of sulfate occurs corresponding to the change in solubility from 29% (equilibrium value at 30 ¬∞C) to approximately 4.5% (at 0 ¬∞C) ‚Äì actually a larger crystal mass is precipitated, since sulfate entrains hydration water, and this has the side effect of increasing the final concentration. There are limitations in the use of cooling crystallization: * Many solutes precipitate in hydrate form at low temperatures: in the previous example this is acceptable, and even useful, but it may be detrimental when, for example, the mass of water of hydration to reach a stable hydrate crystallization form is more than the available water: a single block of hydrate solute will be formed ‚Äì this occurs in the case of calcium chloride); * Maximum supersaturation will take place in the coldest points. These may be the heat exchanger tubes which are sensitive to scaling, and heat exchange may be greatly reduced or discontinued; * A decrease in temperature usually implies an increase of the viscosity of a solution. Too high a viscosity may give hydraulic problems, and the laminar flow thus created may affect the crystallization dynamics. * It is not applicable to compounds having reverse solubility, a term to indicate that solubility increases with temperature decrease (an example occurs with sodium sulfate where solubility is reversed above 32.5 ¬∞C). Cooling crystallizers Vertical cooling crystallizer in a beet sugar factoryThe simplest cooling crystallizers are tanks provided with a mixer for internal circulation, where temperature decrease is obtained by heat exchange with an intermediate fluid circulating in a jacket. These simple machines are used in batch processes, as in processing of pharmaceuticals and are prone to scaling. Batch processes normally provide a relatively variable quality of the product along with the batch. The Swenson-Walker crystallizer is a model, specifically conceived by Swenson Co. around 1920, having a semicylindric horizontal hollow trough in which a hollow screw conveyor or some hollow discs, in which a refrigerating fluid is circulated, plunge during rotation on a longitudinal axis. The refrigerating fluid is sometimes also circulated in a jacket around the trough. Crystals precipitate on the cold surfaces of the screw/discs, from which they are removed by scrapers and settle on the bottom of the trough. The screw, if provided, pushes the slurry towards a discharge port. A common practice is to cool the solutions by flash evaporation: when a liquid at a given T0 temperature is transferred in a chamber at a pressure P1 such that the liquid saturation temperature T1 at P1 is lower than T0, the liquid will release heat according to the temperature difference and a quantity of solvent, whose total latent heat of vaporization equals the difference in enthalpy. In simple words, the liquid is cooled by evaporating a part of it. In the sugar industry, vertical cooling crystallizers are used to exhaust the molasses in the last crystallization stage downstream of vacuum pans, prior to centrifugation. The massecuite enters the crystallizers at the top, and cooling water is pumped through pipes in counterflow. =Evaporative crystallization= Another option is to obtain, at an approximately constant temperature, the precipitation of the crystals by increasing the solute concentration above the solubility threshold. To obtain this, the solute/solvent mass ratio is increased using the technique of evaporation. This process is insensitive to change in temperature (as long as hydration state remains unchanged). All considerations on control of crystallization parameters are the same as for the cooling models. Evaporative crystallizers Most industrial crystallizers are of the evaporative type, such as the very large sodium chloride and sucrose units, whose production accounts for more than 50% of the total world production of crystals. The most common type is the forced circulation (FC) model (see evaporator). A pumping device (a pump or an axial flow mixer) keeps the crystal slurry in homogeneous suspension throughout the tank, including the exchange surfaces; by controlling pump flow, control of the contact time of the crystal mass with the supersaturated solution is achieved, together with reasonable velocities at the exchange surfaces. The Oslo, mentioned above, is a refining of the evaporative forced circulation crystallizer, now equipped with a large crystals settling zone to increase the retention time (usually low in the FC) and to roughly separate heavy slurry zones from clear liquid. Evaporative crystallizers tend to yield larger average crystal size and narrows the crystal size distribution curve. =DTB crystallizer= DTB Crystallizer Schematic of DTB Whichever the form of the crystallizer, to achieve an effective process control it is important to control the retention time and the crystal mass, to obtain the optimum conditions in terms of crystal specific surface and the fastest possible growth. This is achieved by a separation ‚Äì to put it simply ‚Äì of the crystals from the liquid mass, in order to manage the two flows in a different way. The practical way is to perform a gravity settling to be able to extract (and possibly recycle separately) the (almost) clear liquid, while managing the mass flow around the crystallizer to obtain a precise slurry density elsewhere. A typical example is the DTB (Draft Tube and Baffle) crystallizer, an idea of Richard Chisum Bennett (a Swenson engineer and later President of Swenson) at the end of the 1950s. The DTB crystallizer (see images) has an internal circulator, typically an axial flow mixer ‚Äì yellow ‚Äì pushing upwards in a draft tube while outside the crystallizer there is a settling area in an annulus; in it the exhaust solution moves upwards at a very low velocity, so that large crystals settle ‚Äì and return to the main circulation ‚Äì while only the fines, below a given grain size are extracted and eventually destroyed by increasing or decreasing temperature, thus creating additional supersaturation. A quasi-perfect control of all parameters is achieved as DTF crystallizers offer superior control over crystal size and characteristics. This crystallizer, and the derivative models (Krystal, CSC, etc.) could be the ultimate solution if not for a major limitation in the evaporative capacity, due to the limited diameter of the vapour head and the relatively low external circulation not allowing large amounts of energy to be supplied to the system.

The school is attended by around 200 mixed-gender students aged between 16 and 19, mostly on full scholarship, from around 90 countries of the world, who study the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme, a two-year internationally recognized pre-university program. The school is hosted in the village of Duino, between Trieste and Monfalcone, in North-Eastern Italy in the Region of Friuli Venezia Giulia, less than 5 km from the Slovenian border. It was founded in 1982, by the Region of Friuli- Venezia Giulia, with the support of the Italian Government (Ministry of Foreign Affairs), who are still the major financial supporters of the College. The founding headmaster of the college was David B. Sutcliffe, an influential part of the United World Colleges's movement and follower of the Kurt Hahn educational philosophy. Students and staff The students of UWCAd are selected by UWC national selection committees in their home countries on the basis of academic achievement, leadership potential, extracurricular activities involvement and personal qualities. The students selected are awarded a full scholarship. The Italian National Committee for United World Colleges acts under the patronage of the President of the Italian Republic and is responsible for communication with the international organisation and for the selection of Italian pupils. In academic year 2011-12, the school will host 184 students, of which approximately 15% are Italian, 15% come from elsewhere in Western Europe, 20% from Eastern Europe, 15% from the Americas, 15% from Africa and the Middle East and 20% from Asia and Oceania. Teachers are also hired internationally. Apart from being responsible for classroom teaching they act as personal tutors for a group of students and contribute to the residential nature of the College and the running of activities and services. Life at UWCAd UWCAd, following the ideals of German educator Kurt Hahn, founder of the UWC movement, believes in a holistic approach to education which makes personal development of the student central. Courses at the College are taught in English. However, students are not selected on the basis of their ability to speak English (e.g. the Italian National Committee does not consider knowledge of English a prerequisite for application.) In addition to the academic requirements of the IB, the College places importance on the Creativity Action Service (CAS) requirement, which means that each student is required to commit to one creative activity, one physical activity and one social service. As a deviation to the general requirements of the IB, all students at the College are required to study Italian. The subject \\"World Arts and Cultures\\" has been developed in the College by Prof. Henry Thomas, initially as a school based syllabus, and is now taught by IB schools in several countries. The College also collaborates with the Scuola Trio di Trieste, which offers professional musical education. To foster excellence in music the College used to accept 5 students a year under a special music scholarship. The practice was recently discontinued in academic year 2009-10 in an attempt to standardize admission procedures . The UWCAd additionally offers various physical activities program taking advantage out of the location of the College, close to the Alps and the Adriatic Sea, thus including activities such a cross-country and downhill skiing, hiking, kayaking, caving, and sailing. The creative activities program offers a wide variety of choices, ranging from drama to art, pottery, choir, and photography. Students at UWCAd also take part in a variety of initiatives that go beyond the IB curriculum : * Project Weeks. One week a year where students plan and carry out own project and write a report about it * International Affairs and Focus. Lectures and presentations involving a speaker series, encompassing academics and international organization professionals, poets, writers and journalists, politicians, diplomats, NGO workers and scientists. * National Weeks. Period of time during the academic year where students who belong to certain national and linguistic groups present their culture to other members of College. * International Shows. Several times during the year students give shows consisting of dance, music and sketches. Shows might be organized to support a charity. * Cultural Visits. Students go on field trips to visit many cultural and artistic sites in nearby places such as Venice, Aquileia, Rome, Vienna, Ravenna, Ljubjana, Mantova and Bologna. Some visits are incorporated into the coursework of the World Cultures subject taught at the college. * Choir. Students visit nearby sites to perform a wide repertoire of songs by the college choir. * Artistic concerts. The college boasts many musician students who often perform concerts that nearby residents can attend. College and facilities The College does not have a closed campus, rather it is integrated in the village of Duino.

Early life Born Jo Ann Gibson, near Culloden, Georgia on April 17, 1912, she was the youngest of twelve children. Her parents were Owen Boston and Dollie Webb Gibson who had owned a farm. Her father died when Jo Ann was only 6 years old. After her fathers death Jo Ann, her mother, and her eleven other siblings moved to Macon, Georgia. Jo Ann excelled in school and earned valedictorian her graduating year at her high school. She became the first person in her family to become college graduate and attended Fort Valley State College. Career and College Jo Ann graduated from Fort Valley State College with her bachelor's degree in 1934. After College she became a public school teacher in Macon, where she was married to Wilbur Robinson for a short time. Five years later, she went to Atlanta, where she earned an M.A. in English at Atlanta University. She continued her education even after earning her Masters New York's Columbia University and continued to study English. Short After Jo Ann went to teach at Mary Allen College. After teaching in Texas she then accepted a position at Alabama State College in Montgomery. Women's Political Council (WPC) Freedman, Russell (2006) Freedom Walkers The Story of the Montgomery Bus Boycott Holiday House New York It was Montgomery, Alabama she joined the Women's Political Council, which Mary Fair Burks had founded three years earlier. The WPC was an organization dedicated to inspiring African Americans to rise above the level of mediocrity that they had been conditioned to accept, to fight juvenile delinquency, increase voter registration in the African American community and to improve their status as a group. The WPC was also in the development in women's involvement in civic affairs, worked towards encouraging African Americans to vote, and helping women who were victims of rape. Segregation on Montgomery Busses In 1949, Robinson was verbally attacked by a bus driver for sitting in the front \\"Whites only\\" section of the bus. The whites only section was empty. Out of fear that the incident would escalate and that the driver would go from verbal abuse to physical, Robinson left the bus. Her response to the incident was to attempt to start a protest boycott against bus segregation in Alabama. However, when Robinson approached fellow WPC members with her story and proposal, she was told that it was \\"a fact of life in Montgomery.\\" In late 1950, she succeeded Burks as president of the WPC and helped focus the group's efforts on bus abuses. To further her efforts Robinson met with the major of Montgomery at the time William A. Gayle. Robinson met with City Hall's council but they were not interested in what she had to say. When City Hall's leaders were no help, Robinson took matters into her own hands and organized a boycott once again. Robinson was an outspoken critic of the treatment of African- Americans on public transportation. She was also active in the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. The WPC made complaints about the bus seating to the Montgomery City Commission and about abusive drivers, and achieved some concessions, including an undertaking that drivers would be courteous, and having buses stop at every corner in black neighborhoods as they did in white areas. After Brown vs. Board of Education (1954), Robinson informed the mayor of the city that a boycott would come. After Rosa Parks' arrest, they seized the moment to plan the Montgomery bus boycott. On Thursday, December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to move from her seat in the black area of the bus she was traveling on to make way for a white passenger who was standing. Parks, a civil rights organizer, had intended to instigate a reaction from white citizens and authorities. That night, with Parks' permission, Robinson stayed up mimeographing 52,500 handbills calling for a boycott of the Montgomery bus system with the help of the chairman of the Alabama State College business department, John Cannon, and two students. The boycott was supported and fought by many. In a 1976 interview, Robinson pointed out, \\"That boycott was not supported by a few people; it was supported by 52,000 people\\". The boycott was initially planned for just the following Monday. Robinson passed out the leaflets at a Friday afternoon meeting of AME Zionist clergy, among other places, and Reverend L. Roy Bennett requested other ministers attend a meeting that Friday night and to urge their congregations to take part in the boycott. Robinson, Reverend Ralph David Abernathy, two of her senior students and other WPC members then passed out the handbills to high school students leaving school that afternoon. After the success of the one-day boycott, black citizens decided to continue the boycott and established the Montgomery Improvement Association to focus their efforts. The Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. was elected president. Robinson never became a member of this group. She had declined an official position to the Montgomery Improvement Association because of her teaching position at Alabama State. She served on its executive board and edited their newsletter at Kings request. Behind the scenes Robinson also helped in carpooling African Americans to work. She was so involved King took notice in his memoir of the boycott, Stride Towards Freedom. Dr. King said of Robinson, \\"Apparently indefatigable, she , perhaps more than any other person, was active on every level of protest\\". In order to protect her position at Alabama State College and to protect her colleagues, Robinson purposely stayed out of the limelight even though she worked diligently with the MIA. Robinson and other WPC members also helped sustain the boycott by providing transportation for boycotters. Robinson was the target of several acts of intimidation. Robinson was arrested many times. In February 1956, a local police officer threw a stone through the window of her house. Then two weeks later, another police officer poured acid on her car. The violence was so bad that the governor of Alabama ordered the state police to guard the houses of the boycott leaders. The boycott lasted over a year because the bus company would not give in to the demands of the protesters. On December 20, 1956 the boycotts finally ended after the federal district court deemed segregated seating was unconstitutional. However, Robinson fought hard and took great pride in the eventual success of the boycott. In her memoir, Robinson wrote, \\"An oppressed but brave people, whose pride and dignity rose to the occasion, concorded fear, and faced whatever perils had to be confronted. The boycott was the most beautiful memory that all of us who participated will carry to our final resting place.\\" The Montgomery bus boycott broke through and gave real hope as it helped to inspire other protests because of its success and, of course, lead to many protests with the importance of nonviolence that MLK preached. After a student sit-in in early 1960, Robinson and other teachers who supported the students resigned their positions at Alabama State College. Robinson left Alabama State College and moved out of Montgomery that year. She taught at Grambling College in Louisiana for one year then moved to Los Angeles and taught English in the public school system. In Los Angeles, she continued to be active in local women's organizations. Robinson taught in the LA schools until she retired from teaching in 1976. Robinson was strongly against discrimination. Robinson inspired many young women to join the protest and to fight. Robinson said, \\"Women's leadership was no less important to the development of the Montgomery Bus Boycott than was the male and minister-dominated leadership.\\" Robinson's memoir, The Montgomery Bus Boycott and the Women Who Started It, edited by David J. Garrow, was published in 1987 by the University of Tennessee Press.

The approach is favoured by civil rights organisations such as the Anti-Defamation League. The anti-racist curriculum is part of a wider social constructivist movement in the various societies of the Western World, where many scientific worldviews are seen as manifestations of Western cultures who enjoy a privileged position over societies from the \\"Global South\\",Ending Academic Imperialism: a Beginning\\", C. K. Raju along with claiming that there is a sociocultural aspect to education, i.e. that the studies of these subjects in Western societies have usually exhibited racial and cultural bias,\\"Is Science Western in Origin?\\", C. K. Raju and that they focus too much on \\"dead white men\\", especially in mathematics.See ethnomathematics.  Origin  The anti-bias movement was born out of the multiculturalism movement. Some of the people involved in the multiculturalism movement felt that it did not do enough to address social problems in the education system. Multicultural curriculum taught basic facts about different cultures, often on specially designated culture days or holidays, rather than being systematically infused into the entire curriculum. While this did increase students' superficial knowledge of other cultures, some people within the movement wanted students to know why they didn't know about other cultures and why certain people of certain ethnicities and classes are less likely to be economically successful.  Purpose  The stated objectives of the anti-bias curriculum are to raise awareness of bias and to reduce bias. Anti-bias curriculum transgresses the boundaries by actively providing children with a solid understanding of social problems and issues while equipping them with strategies to combat bias and improve social conditions for all. Instead of presenting the culturally dominant view of a subject, idea, history, or person, the anti-bias curriculum presents all possible sides. Such curriculums claim to allow the student to see the \\"whole view\\" of the subject. The anti-bias curriculum is seen by its proponents as a catalyst in the critical analysis of various social conditions. It is implemented with the intent of reducing social oppression with the ultimate goal of \\"social justice\\" in mind.What is Anti-Bias Education? Anti-Defamation League Quotation: \\"Anti-bias education takes an active, problem solving approach that is integrated into all aspects of an existing curriculum and a school's environment.\\"  Examples  Margaret Thatcher, in a speech made during the Conservative Party Conference of 1987, referred to \\"hard left education authorities and extremist teachers\\" teaching \\"anti-racist mathematics‚Äîwhatever that may be\\".\\"See loony left for more context of this stereotype. and later on in 2005, Fox News carried a story detailing \\"The 'anti-racist education' program in place at Newton Public Schools.\\" The article The Politics of Anti-Racist Mathematics by George Gheverghese Joseph goes through many different assumptions made by teachers of mathematics that can have a negative effect on students of ethnic minorities.Joseph, George Gheverghese. \\"The politics of anti-racist mathematics.\\" European Education 26.1 (1994): 67-74. An anti-racist approach to mathematics education could include any or all of the following: * Discussion of the mathematical knowledge of ancient civilizations outside of Europe, and non-European contributions to mathematical knowledge and discovery; * The avoidance of racial stereotypes or cultural bias in classroom material, textbooks, coursework topics and examination questions. For example, a wide range of names from various ethnic backgrounds might be used in word problem questions.Kennedy, Leonard; Tipps, Steve; Johnson, Art (2007). \\"Guiding Children's Learning of Mathematics\\". Cengage Learning. American mathematics instructor Shahid Muhammed has suggested that poor mathematics performance among African Americans is linked to higher anxiety caused by negative stereotyping; as he states that many associate mathematics with middle-class white people. Designing a curriculum Advocates claim there are two parts to an educational curriculum: * The \\"formal curriculum\\", which consists of the educational content, expectations, course materials (e.g. textbooks), evaluation, and instruction. * The \\"hidden curriculum\\", which encompasses all the values passed on by teachers and educators, and from the school or educational milieu (i.e., the culture of the educational setting). For instance, the hidden curriculum teaches children and students to value punctuality and transmits the dominant culture upon ethnic minorities(e.g. chosen holiday celebration, monetary norms, social manners). Anti-bias curriculum advocates claim that varying degrees and layers of oppression exist in educational institutions, and that a biased curriculum perpetuates oppression, interferes with interpersonal relationships, and impedes the acquisition of skills and knowledge. The anti-bias approach urges educators to be aware of these social limitations and to eliminate them via their curricula. The anti-bias approach is intended to teach children about acceptance, tolerance and respect; to critically analyze what they are taught; and to recognize the connections between ethnicity, gender, religion, and social class, and power, privilege, prestige, and opportunity. Criticism There has been criticism of aspects of anti-bias curriculum. Eastern Washington University professor Deirdre Almeida has stated that most anti-bias cirricula omit the contributions of non-African ethnic groups, such as Native Americans, Inuit and Alaska Natives. Almeida has claimed that portrayals of Native Americans in anti-bias material conflate actual aboriginal practices with invented, obsolete or erroneous ideas about Native American culture.Countering Prejudice against American Indians and Alaska Natives through Antibias Curriculum and Instruction. ERIC Digest. Other critics, such as University of Tennessee professor J. Amos Hatch, have claimed that some anti-bias curricula can be construed as actively or passively adopting an anti-European/western racial bias, seeking to minimize contributions of ethnic Europeans in favor of other ethnic groups. Hatch has stated that this ideology has produced \\"anti-bias\\" curricula that is overtly biased against people of European descent or in favor of people of African descent.J.

Biography Norman was born Monty Noserovitch in Stepney in the East End of London, the only child of Jewish parents, Annie (n√©e Berlin) and Abraham Noserovitch, on the second night of Passover in 1928. When Norman's father was young, he travelled from Latvia to England with his mother (Norman's grandmother). As a child during World War II, Norman was evacuated from London but later returned during the Blitz. As a young man he did national service in the RAF, where he became interested in pursuing a career in singing. In the 1950s and early 1960s, Norman was a singer for big bands such as those of Cyril Stapleton, Stanley Black, Ted Heath, and Nat Temple. He also sang in various variety shows, sharing top billing with other singers and comedy stars such as Benny Hill, Harry Secombe, Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan, Harry Worth, Tommy Cooper, Jimmy James, Tony Hancock, Jimmy Edwards, and Max Miller. One of his songs, \\"False Hearted Lover\\", was successful internationally. From the late 1950s, he moved from singing to composing, including songs for performers such as Cliff Richard, Tommy Steele, Count Basie and Bob Hope, and lyrics for musicals and (subsequently) films. In 1957 and 1958, he wrote lyrics for the musicals Make Me an Offer, the English-language version of Irma la Douce (based on a 1956 French musical written by Alexandre Breffort and Marguerite Monnot; the English version was nominated for a Broadway Tony Award), and Expresso Bongo (which Time Out called the first rock and roll musical). Expresso Bongo, written by Wolf Mankowitz was a West End hit, and was later made into a 1960 film starring a young Cliff Richard). Later musicals include Songbook (aka The Moony Shapiro Songbook in New York), which was also nominated for a Broadway Tony and won an Ivor Novello Award; and Poppy (1982), which was also nominated for the Ivor Novello Award, and won the SWET award (renamed \\"the Laurence Olivier Awards\\" in 1984) for \\"Best Musical\\". Further film work included music for the Hammer movie The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll (1960), The Day the Earth Caught Fire (1961), the Bob Hope movie Call Me Bwana (1963), and the TV miniseries Dickens of London (1976). As of 2004, Norman was working on an autobiography, to be entitled A Walking Stick Full of Bagels, and musical versions of the 1954 Kingsley Amis novel, Lucky Jim, and his 1970s musical, Quick Quick Slow.  James Bond Theme  Norman is famous for writing the music to the first James Bond movie, Dr. No, including the \\"James Bond Theme\\", the signature theme of the James Bond franchise. Norman has received royalties since 1962 for the theme. However, as the producers were dissatisfied with Norman's arrangement, John Barry re-arranged the theme. Barry later claimed that it was actually he who wrote the theme, but Norman won two libel actions against publishers for claiming that Barry was the composer, the last against The Sunday Times in 2001. In the made-for-DVD documentary Inside Dr. No, Norman performs a music piece which he wrote for the stage several years earlier entitled \\"Bad Sign, Good Sign\\", that he claims resembles the melody of the \\"James Bond Theme\\" in several places. Norman collected around ¬£600,000 in royalties between the years 1976 and 1999Monty Norman v.

However this mast did not allow good reception in deep valleys, so in 1985 a new, 302 metre tall, guyed, steel framework mast was built, becoming the tallest structure of Rhineland- Palatinate. The elements of this mast were built by the firm of Hein, Lehmann AG, whilst construction work was carried out by BBS AG, Ludwigshafen. The first 20 metres of the mast were built using a small crane. The mast elements in heights between 20 and 100 metres were mounted by the aid of a car crane, while for the sections above a derrick crane was used.

Proletcult Theatre was the theatrical branch of the Soviet cultural movement Proletcult. It was concerned with the powerful expression of ideological content as political propaganda in the years following the revolution of 1917. Platon Kerzhentsev was one of its principal practitioners.von Geldern (1993, 27). It was used as a tool of political agitation that promoted a culture of the factory-floor and industrial motifs, but also folk singing and avant-garde.Stites (1992, 40). Plot was unimportant; its goal was to shock the audience with its style of performance, lighting techniques, props, radio broadcasts, blown-up newspaper headlines and slogans, projected films, circus elements, etc. The Proletcult Theatre attempted to affect the audience psychologically and emotionally, producing a shock in the spectator, the effect of which is to make the viewer aware of the condition of their own lives. This style is often referred to as the theatre of attractions, where an attraction is any aggressive emotional shock that provides the opportunity to raise awareness of the ideological reality of life (to ‚Äúdefamiliarize the familiar‚Äù), particularly the mundane material reality. Prince Serge Wolkonsky taught and gave lectures for Proletcult. Russian film director Sergei Eisenstein was at one time in charge of the Proletcult Theatre before pursuing his film work. His most significant production for the Proletcult was an adaptation of Aleksandr Ostrovsky's satirical comedy Enough Stupidity in Every Wise Man in April 1923.Rudnitsky (1988, 96). He continued many of the experimental and ideologically expressive elements of this theatrical form in his films and intellectual montage technique. Proletcult collapsed at the end of the civil war due to external as well as internal factors, such disputes among leaders and between intellectuals and workers; it lingered on in vestigial form in the 1920s.

The Forvie National Nature Reserve is a national nature reserve that is owned and managed by NatureScot. It is located north of Newburgh in Aberdeenshire, in the northeast of Scotland. The reserve includes the Sands of Forvie, which are the fifth largest sand dune system in Britain, and the least disturbed by human activity. The dune system is an integral part of the Ythan Estuary, which also forms part of the reserve, and separates the sands from Balmedie beach. The reserve contained at one point the largest breeding colony of breeding eider duck in Britain and while they are still a protected feature of the reserve the eider colony suffered dramatic losses starting in 2006 and the subsequent years. The reserve also hosts an internationally important ternery and a protected seal haul-out containing both common seals and grey seals, predominantly the latter. The area is designated as a both a Special Protection Area and a Special Area of Conservation under the Natura 2000 scheme, as well as being a Site of Special Scientific Interest.> The site is designated a Category II protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The sands were the site of the village of Forvie that was abandoned due to drifting sands. Sands of Forvie The Sands of Forvie are one of the largest areas of blown sand in Scotland. The sand at Forvie is formed from the remains of sediment that was transported by rivers to the coast at the end of the last Ice Age. The sediment settled in the sea, but was gradually washed onshore by the action of waves and wind.The Story of Forvie National Nature Reserve. p. 9. The sand dunes at Forvie can be divided into three distinct parts. The southernmost point of the reserve consists of a sand spit at the point where the River Ythan enters the sea. To the north the sand rests on raised beaches terraces and glaciated rocks. North of this region is an area where the sand lies on top of a rock plateau, with glacial deposits of varying depths sandwiched between the rock and the sand. The dunes are highly mobile, and can reach up to 20 m in height. As there is relatively little plant life on these mobile dunes, they have been likened to the Sahara Desert.The Story of Forvie National Nature Reserve. p. 10. Flora and fauna thumb The reserve contains large areas of sandy foreshore, mobile and fixed dunes, dune pasture and lowland heath and the successional development of vegetation. The sand dunes are of various stages of evolution and contain plethora of plant species including marram grass (Ammophila arenaria), red fescue, (Festuca rubra), crowberry, (Empetrum nigrum), the cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix), common sedge, (Carex nigra), marsh pennywort (Hydrocotyle vulgaris) and the invasive creeping willow (Salix repens ssp. argentea). Vascular plants are an identified and protected feature of the reserve under the Sands of Forvie and Ythan Estuary SSSI. 15 species are identified on reserve with 10 of which are red book listed species (Astragalus danicus, Carex maritima, Coeloglossum viride, Corollarhiza trifida, Gentianella campestris, Platanthera bifolia, Salsola kali, Mertensia maritima, Radiola linoides and Teesdalia nudicaulis) and 5 of which are classified as UK scarce species (Equisetum variegatum, Festuca arenaria, Ophiglossum azoricum, Potamogeton filiformis, Puccinellia distans). Four species of tern breed at Forvie, building their nests among the dunes and on the beach. Little terns and arctic terns favour the foreshore and raised beaches, while the sandwich terns and common terns nest amongst the marram tussocks of the dune system.The Story of Forvie National Nature Reserve. p. 13. The breeding success of the terns has fluctuated widely over the years,The Story of Forvie National Nature Reserve. p. 14. and since 1995 NatureScot have undertaken selected culling of predating species, specifically crows, gulls and foxes.The Story of Forvie National Nature Reserve. p. 14. In addition to culling, NatureScot have also trialled the use of decoy terns to attract little terns into the areas protected from foxes by fences, as well as providing artificial shelters for tern chicks to use to avoid crows and gulls.The Story of Forvie National Nature Reserve. p. 25.The Story of Forvie National Nature Reserve. p. 26. In recent years the colonies of sandwich tern and black headed gulls have had great success in breeding with some of the highest populations recorded to date in 2019. The mudflats of the estuary provide an important wintering ground for migratory birds such as wigeon, oystercatcher, golden plover, lapwing, dunlin, curlew and redshank, and around 15,000 geese may be seen on the estuary each spring. The reserve hosts a population of protected breeding eider that spend the breeding season on reserve, with many heading to the Tay estuary for the winter, although there is also a smaller population that remains year-round. In 2005 the reserve held a population of over 5000 eiders but has since suffered losses and in 2019 recorded a spring peak of 1323 eiders. The cliffs in the northern part of the reserve host breeding colonies of many seabirds, including northern fulmar, shag, cormorant, kittiwake and razorbill. Raptor species such as short-eared owls, kestrel, sparrowhawk, osprey and buzzard are also regularly seen, and in total 255 species of bird have been recorded at Forvie.The Story of Forvie National Nature Reserve. p. 15. Forvie is a popular site for viewing grey and common seals, which haul out onto beaches and mudflats at the mouth of the Ythan estuary.The Story of Forvie National Nature Reserve. p. 2. The Protection of Seals (Designated Sea Haul-out Sites) (Scotland) Order 2014 introduced additional protection for seals at 194 designated haul-out sites and in 2017 the seal haul-out site at Forvie National Nature reserve was granted this designation and legal protection. To avoid disturbance to the seals the advised viewpoint is establish on the newburgh beach. The population is growing rapidly with numbers anywhere between 1000 to 3000 seals present. Bottlenose dolphins visit the seas off Forvie, and there is a population of otter on the River Ythan. Other mammals found at Forvie and those typical of northeast Scotland such roe deer, red foxes, badgers and stoats.The Story of Forvie National Nature Reserve. p. 16. History The coastline at Forvie has a long history of human occupation. The earliest evidence of human activity takes the form of flint working sites and shell middens, which date from around 8000 years ago. Excavations have also revealed burial cairns from the Neolithic period (around 6000 years ago), and kerb cairns (built to hold cremation remains) dating from the Bronze Age.The Story of Forvie National Nature Reserve. p. 18. Other Bronze Age objects found at Forvie include pieces of a quern-stone and fragments of pottery. The remains of a small village of 31 huts dating from around 700 BC have also been identified. Finds from the village include jet beads, bracelets, querns and pottery.The Story of Forvie National Nature Reserve. p. 19. The deserted village of Forvie lies within the sands dunes. Excavations of the village church, which is dedicated to St Adamnan, shown that it was constructed in the 12th-century, and the dating of burials within the church indicate that it had become a ruin by the 15th- century: local folk history tells of a nine-day storm that led to the village being engulfed by sand in August 1413. The parish of Forvie was annexed by the neighbouring parish of Slains in 1573. In 1959 the Sands of Forvie was declared a national nature reserve (NNR) by agreement between the Nature Conservancy Council (predecessor body of NatureScot) and the landowners; the NNR was extended in 1979 to include the Ythan Estuary. In 2003 were purchased from the landowners, with the remaining land being purchased in 2012.The Story of Forvie National Nature Reserve. p. 22. =During the World Wars= Forvie was active in World Wars I and II, although very few details are recorded on the use of the area. It was incorrectly claimed there was a nine-hole golf course from 1900 to the outbreak of World War II. The course built for Lady Cathcart in 1900 was on the west coast island Uist. The layout of Forvie and Newburgh could be mistaken for the mouth of the River Don in Aberdeen. With this is mind, defences were put in places around the mouth of the Ythan. These consisted of pill boxes, two gun batteries and anti-tank blocks built by the 143rd Pioneer Corps. From a review of vulnerable beaches from April‚ÄìOctober 1941, Forvie appeared on this list and was identified as \\"blocked with mines\\". The minefield ran from East to West (WO ref 31/521474 to 538472). These were British Type C land mines weighing about 65 lbs each. Following a clear up of the area in July 1944, a number of landmines were unaccounted for due to the shifting sands of the area. Mine clearance altered the area slightly as the Bomb Disposal Unit from the Royal Engineers used a converted Bren gun carrier (known as a wasp) as a flamethrower to scorch vegetation on the mined area. Images of the clearance and the location of the minefield is recorded in a local book covering World War 2 in NE Scotland. Records show on some days 222 mines being dealt with, the actual mine count is unknown but the area took several months to clear. on 27 July 1944, Sapper Harry Dean (28) of 11 coy, Royal Engineers was killed whilst clearing a mine at Forvie. Sapper Dean is buried in Yorkshire http://www.royalengineersbombdisposal- eod.org.uk/dean_h.html Minefield start / end from Royal Engineers file in TNA - Kew Forvie sands was used to train the Gordon Highlanders and Highland Light Infantry in desert warfare, in addition to this Forvie Moor was used to train soldiers in the use of grenade, anti-tank grenades and 2\\" trench mortars. Since the war, mortar bombs have been found across the moor. Craters are still visible in the area. The soldiers training at Forvie were billeted at the Slains Lodge and buildings in Collieston. On 3 November 1940, 30 High Explosive Bombs were dropped on Forvie Links by the luftwaffe. This is listed in the Aberdeenshire Civil Defence register, the craters can be seen in 1941 and 1946 aerial photos. Whilst soldiers were training there, the moor were off limits to locals. However, on Sundays, the locals could use the moor. During this time, locals collected birds eggs to use as food was rationed, and there was a plentiful supply of rabbits. On Sunday 30 November 1941, three local boys found an unexploded anti-tank grenade in a rabbit burrow that the army had been demonstrating to the home guard. One of the boys (Alex Ross), then threw it away where it exploded causing him to lose sight in one eye. On 31 March 1941, the British steamer Melrose Abbey ran aground. On 2 April 1941 she was hit by a drifting sea mine blowing a large hole in her side, and settled on the Ythan river bed. During this time, a machine gun was posted at Forvie Sands to offer some protection for the vessel whilst plans were made to move her as she was a target for passing aircraft. The ship was refloated on 26 July 1941 and towed to Aberdeen for repairs. She was later sunk by U-356 on 27 December 1942 north-east of the Azores. Several websites confirm this sinking, but this disagrees with the information in the reference below, which states that \\"As for Melrose Abbey, she was released from the Royal Navy in May 1945 and returned to her former owners, the Associated Humber Lines.\\" The second reference may help to resolve this mix-up of ship names. Beside the pill box of Forvie, two mobile naval 4\\" guns were places and controlled by 942nd Defence battery. On 26 January 1942, the SS Lesrix, which was carrying machinery, ran aground off Hackley head during a blizzard. Locals in the community aided in the rescue of some of the crew, although ten crew members were lost. A bronze medal for gallantry was given by the King to one local for his part. During patrols on the beach and cliffs of Forvie, a dinghy was found and this sparked a search for a spy that had been landed by submarine. This spy was caught in the moray area. It was rumoured that Tillery house near Udny had fascist sympathizers, where spies and airmen were told this was a \\"safe house\\" during the war. Since there were also Norwegian army personnel in the area who patrolled the beaches, the coast guard and home guard were issued with passes to identify themselves to the Norwegian soldiers. In 1948, the Forvie area was earmarked to be a bombing and artillery range for the Royal Air Force and Army, as a site further north than the existing area at Lunan Bay near Arbroath. Forvie was to be used for air to ground and dive bombing practice. This involved a gunnery range out at sea and a rifle range on the moor. This proposal was cancelled in 1950; records exist in the National Archives on the proposal. Visitors The Forvie National Nature Reserve is visited by around 35,000 people each year.The Story of Forvie National Nature Reserve. p. 27. Stevenson Forvie Centre near Collieston at the northern end of the reserve provides information to visitors. The centre first opened in the 1980s, and was substantially upgraded in 1998 with funding from Shell and a bequest from a local resident, Margaret Stevenson, after whom the centre is now named. Two waymarked trails to allow visitors to access the reserve. The 5.5 km Dune Trail is a circular route around the southern part of the reserve, through the dunes landscape and out to the beach, passing the site of the abandoned village and the ruins of the kirk. The 3.4 km Heath Trail is a circular route starting and finishing at the visitor centre, passing through the heathland of the northern part of the reserve. The two paths can be linked by a path running along the seafront. References =Citations= =Bibliography= * External links *Abandoned Communities ...

In mathematics, Cayley's formula is a result in graph theory named after Arthur Cayley. It states that for every positive integer n, the number of trees on n labeled vertices is n^{n-2}. The formula equivalently counts the number of spanning trees of a complete graph with labeled vertices . Proof Many proofs of Cayley's tree formula are known. One classical proof of the formula uses Kirchhoff's matrix tree theorem, a formula for the number of spanning trees in an arbitrary graph involving the determinant of a matrix. Pr√ºfer sequences yield a bijective proof of Cayley's formula. Another bijective proof, by Andr√© Joyal, finds a one-to-one transformation between n-node trees with two distinguished nodes and maximal directed pseudoforests. A proof by double counting due to Jim Pitman counts in two different ways the number of different sequences of directed edges that can be added to an empty graph on n vertices to form from it a rooted tree; see Double counting (proof technique)#Counting trees.  History  The formula was first discovered by Carl Wilhelm Borchardt in 1860, and proved via a determinant. In a short 1889 note, Cayley extended the formula in several directions, by taking into account the degrees of the vertices.

He is best known for the detailed surrealistic cover art he created for a number of British bands. Wilkinson's breakthrough came through his association with the neo-progressive rock band Marillion in the 1980s. He went on to design art for the subsequent solo career of their lead singer, Fish, as well as bands such as Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. Though versed in a number of techniques, he is considered to be a master of the airbrush. In 2012, his sleeve for the 1984 Marillion album Fugazi was chosen by Gigwise as the 29th greatest album artwork of all time. In 2015, Wilkinson designed the artwork for the Tya Brewery in √òvre √Ördal, Norway. Biography Wilkinson was inspired by 1960s artists such as Hapshash and the Coloured Coat (a collaboration between Michael English and Nigel Waymouth) and Rick Griffin. Wilkinson's break came with his designs for Marillion in the 1980s, who were then second only to Iron Maiden in terms of their sales of T-shirts and merchandise. Wilkinson's first artistic creation for Marillion was the cover of their debut 12\\" EP Market Square Heroes (1982). Subsequently, Wilkinson's art work would be used on all of Marillion's albums and 12\\" releases through The Thieving Magpie (1988). When Fish left the band Wilkinson went with him, providing the artwork for several of his 1990s albums and singles. In 1997, he collaborated with Bill Smith Studios (which had replaced him as Marillion's official art group) on the Best of Both Worlds compilation CD. The compilation included songs from the eras of the band with and without Fish, and the record label, EMI, decided it should also include artwork reflective of both eras. In 2000, Fish and Wilkinson collaborated on a book, Masque, which, in \\"back and forth\\" format, described the process by which the Fish and Marillion album covers were created. Wilkinson will likely always be most closely identified with Fish and Marillion (in a similar fashion to Roger Dean's association with Yes or Paul Whitehead's association with Genesis). Wilkinson's work for Marillion gained attention and led to him designing Monsters of Rock posters. This in turn brought him to the attention of heavy metal band Judas Priest. He has named \\"The Four Horsemen\\" from Judas Priest's 2008 album Nostradamus as the work he is most pleased with. He has designed miscellaneous pieces for Bon Jovi, Jimmy Page, the Who and Kylie Minogue. Outside of the music community, he has also done numerous book covers, advertisements, comic art (including a 1993 Judge Anderson episode in the Judge Dredd Megazine) and commissioned pieces.

The idea behind IPI is that the disk drives themselves are as simple as possible, containing only the lowest level control circuitry, while the IPI interface card encapsulates most of the disk control complexity.

Ioannis Vlachos was born in Anopolis village in Sfakia, a semi-autonomous region of Crete, in 1722 or 1730. His father, who was also a wealthy shipowner, sent him to be educated abroad. Due to his education, his compatriots called him \\"Daskalos\\" (teacher), hence his nickname Daskalogiannis, literally \\"John the Teacher.\\" He is referred to as a town clerk in 1750, as chairman of the region of Sfakia in 1765, and as the owner of four, three-mast merchant ships.Detorakis, Turkish rule in Crete, p. 358 These would have sailed from Prosyalo and the gulf of Loutro. Daskalogiannis knew Emmanouil Benakis at Mani and it is likely that Benakis introduced him to Count Orlov who Catherine the Great had sent to the Peloponnese in 1769 to instigate a revolt there. Many men from Sfakia also participated in the revolt which Orlov instigated in the Peloponnese. Leader of revolt In early 1770, he was contacted by Russian emissaries, who hoped to instigate a revolt amongst the Greek subjects of the Ottoman Empire. Daskalogiannis agreed to fund and organize a rebellion in Sfakia against the Turkish authorities when the Russian emissaries promised to support him. In the spring of 1770, Daskalogiannis made preparations for the revolt; he brought together men, rifles, and supplies and had defenses built at strategic locations. However, the Russian fleet in the Aegean, under Count Orlov, did not sail for Crete, and the revolt was left to rely on its own resources. The uprising began on 25 March 1770, with the flag raised at the church of Agios Georgios of Anopolis, and for a short time, parts of Crete had the attributes of an independent nation, including its own coins minted in a cave near Hora Sfakion. The Russian intervention, promised to Daskalogiannis, failed to materialize Detorakis, Turkish rule in Crete, p. 359 and the uprising did not spread to the lowlands. Without outside support, it was put down brutally by the superior Turkish forces of the island, which easily defeated the 1,300 rebels. Sfakia was for the first time fully dominated by Turkish forces. Daskalogiannis surrendered with 70 men at the castle of Frangokastello near Hora Sfakion. On the orders of the Pasha of Candia/Chandax (Heraklion), he was tortured outside Heraklion's harbor fortress, skinned alive, and executed on 17 June 1771.Detorakis, Turkish rule in Crete, p. 360 He is said to have suffered the torture in silence. The Turks forced Daskalogiannis' brother to watch the torturous execution, which allegedly drove him insane.Detorakis, Turkish rule in Crete, p. 361 Legacy Daskalogiannis was immortalized in several folk tales and songs, the most prominent of which is the celebrated epic ballad by Barba-Pantzelios, a poor cheese-maker from Mouri ‚Äì To tragoudi tou Daskalogianni of 1786:Roderick Beaton Folk Poetry of Modern Greece 248 pages Publisher: Cambridge University Press (20 May 2004) :‚Ä¶Œ¶œÑŒ¨ŒΩŒøœÖŒΩ œÉœÑŒø Œ¶œÅŒ±Œ≥Œ∫ŒøŒ∫Œ¨œÉœÑŒµŒªŒø Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÉœÑŒøŒΩ œÄŒ±œÉŒ¨ œÄŒøœÉœéŒΩŒøœÖ, :Œ∫Œπ ŒµŒ∫ŒµŒØŒΩŒøœÇ Œ¥ŒøœçŒ¥ŒµŒπ œÑ' œåœÅŒΩœÑŒπŒΩŒø Œ∫Œπ ŒµœÖœÑœçœÇ œÑœÉŒøŒπ ŒæŒ±œÅŒºŒ±œÑœéŒΩŒøœÖ. :ŒüœçŒªŒøœÖœÇ œÑœÉŒøŒπ ŒæŒ±œÅŒºŒ±œÑœéœÉŒ±œÉŒπ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÑœÉŒøŒπ ŒºœÄŒπœÉœÑŒ±Œ≥Œ∫œâŒΩŒØŒ∂ŒøœÖ :Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÑœåœÑŒµœÇ Œ¥Œ± œÑŒø ŒΩŒπœéœÉŒ±œÉŒπ œÄœâœÇ Œ¥ŒµŒΩ ŒæŒ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≥œÖœÅŒØŒ∂ŒøœÖ. :...They arrive at Frangokastello and surrender to the pasha, :and he gives the order to disarm them at once. :All of them were disarmed and ill at ease, :for now they sensed that they would never go home.

Until 1978 the aerial of the medium wave transmitter consisted of 4 guyed steel framework masts, which are insulated against ground. In the mid 1970s two of these masts were dismantled. One of them was rebuilt on a new site not far away from it earlier site in order to form with one of the two masts, which were not dismantled a directional aerial, while the other was rebuilt at Nierstein in Rhineland-Palatina. On the site of the latter mast a guyed steel framework mast was erected, which is also insulated against ground. At the construction of this mast, the length of the upper guys were chosen in such way, that there is no disturbation of its radiation pattern when grounded directly at the anchor blocks. So the upper guys do not have any intermediate insulators. They are only insulated toward the mast. However the guys of the lowest level are divided by one intermediate insulator electrically in two parts. Until October 19, 2004 there was a shortwave transmitter on the site of the Bodenseesender, which was used to transmit the program of SWR 3 on 7265 kHz. For the shortwave transmitter, there was a small cage aerial at 48¬∞1‚Ä≤24‚Ä≥N and 9¬∞7‚Ä≤11‚Ä≥E and a dipole aerial at 48¬∞1‚Ä≤29‚Ä≥N and 9¬∞7‚Ä≤5‚Ä≥E.

Geary David Cyril Geary (born June 7, 1957 in Providence, Rhode Island) is a United States cognitive developmental and evolutionary psychologist with interests in mathematical learning and sex differences. He is currently a Curators‚Äô Professor and Thomas Jefferson Fellow in the Department of Psychological Sciences and Interdisciplinary Neuroscience Program at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri. Career Geary received a BS degree in psychology from Santa Clara University (California) in 1979, and an MS from the clinical child/school psychology program at California State University at Hayward (now East Bay) in 1981. After completing the MS degree, he worked for the emergency treatment center of the Mental Research Institute in Palo Alto, California, and began the Ph.D. program at the University of California, Riverside, in 1982. His initial interests were in hemispheric laterality and associated sex differences, but focused his dissertation work on mathematical cognition under the direction of Keith Widaman (now at UC, Davis). After completing his Ph.D. in developmental psychology in 1986, he took a one-year position at the University of Texas at El Paso and then moved to the University of Missouri, first at the Rolla campus (1987‚Äì89) and then in Columbia. During this time, he served as chair of the Department of Psychological Sciences (2002‚Äì2005) and contributed heavily to the creation of the Ph.D. program in developmental psychology. Geary's wide-ranging interests are reflected in invited addresses in a variety of departments (anthropology, biology, behavior genetics, computer science, education, government, mathematics, neuroscience, physics, and psychology) and Universities throughout the United States, as well as in Canada, Europe, and East Asia. Geary's research on mathematics learning, evolutionary psychology, and sex differences has been featured in many popular press outlets, including Discover, Education Week, Forbes, CBS News, and MSNBC among many others. Geary's research on children's mathematical development resulted in a MERIT award from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In 2005, the University of Missouri awarded Geary a Curators‚Äô Professorship, and the Thomas Jefferson Professorship in 2009. Among other distinctions, he is 2009 co-recipient of the George A. Miller Award for an Outstanding Recent Article on General Psychology for the 2007 Psychological Science in the Public Interest monograph on sex differences in mathematics and science, co-authored with Halpern, Benbow, Gur, Hyde, and Gernsbacher. He is a fellow of the Association for Psychological Science (2005) and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (2011). Public service Geary contributed to the 1998 Mathematics Framework for California Public Schools and in 2006 was appointed to the President's National Mathematics Advisory Panel. While serving on the panel, he chaired the learning processes task group. In 2007, he was appointed by President George W. Bush to the National Board of Directors, Institute of Education Sciences (IES), and served through 2010. He is also co-author of Developing effective fractions instruction for kindergarten through 8th grade: A practice guide and an on-line overview of learning disabilities in mathematics for parents and teachers. Personal life Geary is married to Yin Xia, an applied economist. Research Geary's research interests are centered on his four books, Children's mathematical development (1994), Male, female (1998, 2010, second edition), Origin of mind (2005), and Evolution of vulnerability (2015); the latter was discussed in an interview with the Guardian. He is also co-author of the 2008 Sex differences: Summarizing more than a century of scientific research, and co-editor with Drs. Berch and Mann Koepke of a five-volume series on mathematical cognition and learning. His research on mathematical development ranged from mathematical modeling of adults‚Äô processing of arithmetic problems; the effects of aging on these processes; and cross national and cross generational differences in mathematical abilities. In this area, he is best known for his research on learning difficulties in mathematics and in 1993 published a theoretical and review article that outlined subtypes of disabilities and helped to organize subsequent research in this area. He currently directs the Missouri Longitudinal Study of Mathematical Learning and Disability. Geary's research in evolutionary psychology also ranges across a variety of issues, from evolution of the hominid brain to men's hormonal responses while competing against members of their in-group or against an out-group. He has also written extensively on human paternal investment (fatherhood) and the evolution of the human family, and is one of the pioneers in evolutionary developmental psychology and evolutionary educational psychology.

Plot A 25-year- old Chinese adoptee travels to China to find her birth parents, but they reject her, stating they never had a daughter. While praying, she lifts a small Buddha and immediately collapses, vomiting blood. The initial diagnosis is that the woman contracted SARS in China. Meanwhile, House learns his father has died, but refuses to attend the funeral. Cuddy uses the SARS diagnosis as a ruse to ‚Äúinoculate‚Äù House, in reality injecting him with a powerful sedative. House wakes up to find himself in a car with his estranged best friend Wilson, who is taking him to his father's funeral. While being driven to the funeral, House works with his team by phone. Their discussions are interrupted when Wilson is pulled over by a policeman for a House-created traffic offense. The stop results in Wilson's arrest on an old out-of-state warrant, still open because of another House-related error. Back at Princeton- Plainsboro, the team is still perplexed by the patient's illness. House arrives at the funeral and delivers an unsuitable yet self-enlightening eulogy. Afterwards, House feigns grief in order to obtain a DNA sample from his father's corpse. House calls China to learn more about his patient's trip, and finds out that the birth parents adamantly refused to acknowledge the daughter's existence. Wilson suggests that China's one-child policy may have caused the parents to try to kill the girl. House hypothesizes that the biological parents attempted to kill their infant by pushing needles into her brain. The needles were disturbed by a powerful magnet contained within the Buddha statue, affecting her brain functions and causing her first collapse. Kutner, who has formed an emotional attachment with the patient, explains to her adoptive parents that her alcoholism was caused by a needle which had embedded itself in the portion of her brain that controls addictive behavior. As the day ends, Wilson tells House that he is returning to Princeton- Plainsboro, and House tells Wilson that the DNA test has proved his theory that John was not his biological father. Wilson says that no one gets to choose their parents, and admits that the trip was the most fun he has had since Amber died.

The villages were built and settled by German Pietists, who were persecuted in their homeland by the German state government and the Lutheran Church. Calling themselves the True Inspiration Congregations (), Reprinted: they first settled in New York near Buffalo in what is now the town of West Seneca. However, seeking more isolated surroundings, they moved to Iowa (near present-day Iowa City) in 1856. They lived a communal life until 1932. For eighty years, the Amana Colony maintained an almost completely self- sufficient local economy, importing very little from the industrializing American economy. The Amanians were able to achieve this independence and lifestyle by adhering to the specialized crafting and farming occupations that they had brought with them from Europe. Craftsmen passed their skills and techniques on from one generation to the next. They used hand, horse, wind, and water power, and made their own furniture, clothes, and other goods. The community voted to form a for-profit organization during the Great Depression, the Amana Society, which included the Amana Corporation. Today, the Seven Villages of Amana are a tourist attraction known for its restaurants and craft shops. The colony was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1965. As of the 2010 Census, the population of the seven villages in order of population was as follows: * Middle Amana (581)https://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=1951600 * Amana (Main Amana) (442)https://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=1901720 * South Amana (159)https://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=1973965 * Homestead (148)https://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=1936975 * West Amana (135)https://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=1983505 * High Amana (115)https://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=1936030 * East Amana (56) Early history =Origins in Europe= The Amana Colony stems from a religious movement started in 1714 in Germany by Eberhard L. Gruber and Johann F. Rock. They had both grown displeased with the dogmatism of the Lutheran Church and began to study the Pietist teachings of Philipp Spener. Gruber and Rock fervently spread their beliefs and gained a following originally known as the New Spiritual Economy. They believed that God communicated through individuals with the \\"gift of inspiration\\", just as he did in the days of the prophets. This individual was called an instrument () because he was thought to be used as a tool of God's will to speak directly to his people. To spread their beliefs, the group led by Rock and Gruber traveled through Germany, Switzerland, and the Dutch Republic. The group became known as the Community of True Inspiration, and followers were called Inspirationalists. The Inspirationalists faced the opposition of the governments of the German states because they refused to serve as soldiers and would not send their children to Lutheran public schools. Adherents to the faith were imprisoned, flogged, and stripped of their possessions. To escape persecution, many Inspirationalists moved to Hesse, the most liberal German state at the time. Here, the number of Inspirationalists greatly multiplied. Gruber died in 1728 and Rock followed in 1749; left without an instrument, the Inspirationalists' numbers declined in the subsequent decades. Within a span of a few months starting in 1817, Michael Krausert, Barbara Heinemann, and Christian Metz were all named instruments. Although Krausert soon left the church, Metz and Heinemann were able to revive interest in the Community. Heinemann retreated from the Community's affairs in 1823, making Metz the sole leader of the church. The Community continued to face persecution from German states for their refusal to serve as soldiers or utilize public schools. In the 1830s, Metz conceived of the notion of leasing a large area of land as a refuge for the Community. They first leased land from a cloister near Ronneburg, then from the Arnsburg Abbey. They expanded to Engelthal Abbey in 1834, and managed all of their land holdings in common. It was at these estates that the philosophy of communal life began to grow within the Community. By the late 1830s, the Community was prospering. =Move to America= The Hesse government levied harsher fines and rents against the Community in the wake of economic turmoil in the late 1830s. Metz and other leaders realized that they had to find a new home for the Community. On August 27, 1842, leaders of the Community gathered at Armenburg, Germany, to discuss a movement to the United States. The Community arrived in New York on October 26. For the next three months, church leaders examined tracts of land to establish a new commune. They agreed to purchase the Seneca Indian Reservation near Buffalo, which had recently become open to European settlement following the Second Treaty of Buffalo Creek. The first settlement was called Ebenezer after the Eben-Ezer in the Books of Samuel. Over 800 members of the Community immigrated to Ebenezer from Germany. The Community founded a \\"provisional constitution\\" in 1843 that defined the intentions of the community, which they called the Ebenezer Society. All lands and buildings were to be held in common, and prosperous settlers were expected to pay community expenses. The initial plan was that, after some time, the land would be divided among the people according to their contribution of money and labor. However, leaders saw that the disparity in wealth, skills and age would make it difficult for all to purchase a portion of land‚Äîthe community would fall apart as a result. Therefore, the constitution was amended on October 23, 1850, to make the Community exclusively communal. The purchase was adequate for the first 800 villagers. However, the success of the community brought new settlers, and by 1854, it was apparent that a larger tract of land was needed. Furthermore, the growth of the nearby city of Buffalo concerned church elders, who thought that it could become a bad influence. Buffalo's growth also greatly increased nearby real estate prices, making an extension to Ebenezer financially unfeasible. Metz met with Community leaders on August 31, 1854, to discuss the situation, and the group agreed to send four men (including Metz) to search for a new home out west. The new Kansas Territory seemed like an ideal location, so the group of four traveled across the new lands. However, they could not agree on an appropriate location. Two elders were then sent to the state of Iowa to examine the large government land grants. Finding appropriate lands near the Iowa River, they returned to Ebenezer to encourage purchase. The Inspirationalists sent four men to purchase the land and all holdings in the vicinity. The first village in what would become the Amana Colonies was laid out in 1855 (). =Founding= The new colony was originally to be named , German for \\"remain faithful\\". However, residents found difficulty properly pronouncing the word in English. Instead, the Inspirationalists settled on Amana, a Biblical name with similar meaning. Under Iowa law, the Community had to incorporate as a business, so the Amana Society was founded as the governing body in 1859. Shortly thereafter, the Community agreed to adopt a new constitution. The resulting twelve-article document was very similar to the amended Ebenezer Constitution. One early problem for each settler was the lack of rail access; the nearest station was in Iowa City away. However, in 1861 the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad built a railroad station in nearby Homestead. Recognizing the need for the rail connection, the Community purchased the entire village of Homestead (). This brought their land holdings to : in timberland, in cultivated fields, in grazing land, in settlements, and in vegetable gardens. Most of the land is in Iowa County, with approximately in Johnson County. By 1862, five more villages were laid, bringing the total number to seven: *Amana vor der H√∂he (High Amana) () *S√ºd-Amana (South Amana) () *West-Amana (West Amana) () *Ost-Amana (East Amana) () *Mittel-Amana (Middle Amana) () Each village had between forty and one hundred houses, a church, school, bakery, dairy, wine-cellar, post office, sawmill, and general store. Every able-bodied man was expected to serve in the fire department, and each village had its own fire department. Most houses were two stories and built with local sandstone, which has an unusual hue. They are mostly square with gable roofs. The last of the 1,200 Inspirationalist settlers from New York arrived in 1864. By 1908, the Community had grown to 1,800 and owned over $1.8 million in assets.  Life until 1932  =Government= The Great Council of the Brethren, also known as the Board of Trustees, oversaw the affairs and conduct of the Amana Society. Trustees were expected to tend to the internal affairs of the Society as well as its external business interests. Trustees were elected annually by popular vote from the elders of the Community. The trustees would then elect out of their own a president, vice president, and secretary; incumbents were usually re-elected. The group met alternately in different villages on the first Tuesday of each month. Each June, the trustees were expected to keep the Society informed of the general condition of its affairs. The Great Council also served as the high court of the Community. Each village was governed by a group of seven to nineteen elders. Decisions would be made for each village by a group of these elders led by one of the trustees. This governing board was known as the Bruderrath. Elders were selected based on their piety and spirituality. Werkzeug had the authority to appoint elders, but at times when there were no such individuals, they were selected by the Great Council. The Bruderrath had the authority to appoint foremen for each industry. Individuals could petition the Bruderrath if they sought more money, a larger house, or a lighter workload. The Head Elder had the highest level of authority in each village, even over the Bruderrath trustee. Each community member was provided with an annual sum, with men receiving $40 to $100 a year depending on their career, women receiving $25 to $30 a year, and parents of children receiving an additional $5 to $10 per child. This money was expected to be spent at village stores. Members who failed to budget adequately would be admonished by the Community. If the member did not mend his ways, they could be expelled by the community. Members who were expelled or voluntarily left the Community would receive all of the money they had invested into the common fund plus interest. =Marriage and children= Originally, marriage was permitted only \\"with the consent of God\\" through the Werkzeug. Marriage was considered a spiritual weakness. Ceremonies were not joyous affairs, but were instead designed to impress the importance of the task upon the couple. Childbearing was similarly discouraged. Views on marriage gradually liberalized, and the Great Council was later given the authority to approve marriage. Men were not allowed to marry until they were 24 years old. If the Great Council found no fault with the union, then the couple could be wed after a year's wait. An elder would bless the marriage and the community would provide a wedding feast. The community did not recognize divorce, and second marriages (even in the case of a widow) were considered particularly reprehensible. A citizen would be expelled from the community for one year for marrying an individual outside of the colonies, even if the partner wished to join the society. =Dining= There was no cooking in the homes of Amana citizens; instead, citizens originally ate together in groups of thirty to forty-five. Communal kitchens, each with its own garden, hosted meals. Men would sit at one table while women and small children would sit at another. Prayers were said in German before and after meals. Meals were not considered social affairs so conversation was discouraged. There were as many as fifty-five communal kitchens: sixteen in Amana, ten in Middle Amana, nine in Homestead, six in South and West Amana, and four in East and High Amana. The kitchen boss () was tasked with kitchen operations: cooking, serving, preserving, and chicken husbandry. Kitchen personnel were appointed by the Bruderrat. Communal kitchens were usually large, two-story structures with an attached residence for the K√ºchebaas. Kitchens typically had a large brick hearth stove, a wood- or coal-burning oven, and a sink. Though kitchens originally had to bring water from the nearest well, they were the first buildings to be connected to the colony waterworks. Kitchens were named after the K√ºchebaas. The communal kitchen concept eroded some time around 1900, as married residents began to eat in their own homes. Food was still cooked in the communal kitchens, but housewives would take the food home. Kitchen staff and single residents still ate in the communal kitchens. Each kitchen operated individually and had different practices. However, menus were largely standardized across the colonies to prevent any residents from receiving more than their fair share. Saturday night would offer pork sausages or pork rinds, boiled potatoes, cottage cheese with chives, bread with cream cheese, and streusel. The noon meal on Sunday was rice soup, fried potatoes, creamed spinach, boiled beef, streusel, and tea or coffee. Menus changed with the seasons; for example, more beef and pork was served in the autumn and winter because it was easier to keep fresh meat. =Work= Common positions held by women were in the kitchens, communal gardens, and laundry, among eight occupations. Men on the other hand had 39 different jobs to choose from, including barber, butcher, tailor, machine shop worker, and doctor. Children also participated in jobs, such as harvesting and agricultural duties for boys and kitchen work for the girls. Children stayed with their mothers until they were two years old. Then, the child would have to attend Kinderschule until the age of seven. At that point, the child would attend school six days a week, all year round until the age of fourteen or fifteen. At school, they shelled, cleaned and graded seed corn, picked fruit, and studied reading, writing and arithmetic. Amana was known for its hospitality towards outsiders. Members would never turn a person in need away. They would feed and shelter the homeless who would pass through on the train. Some would even be hired as laborers. They would receive good wages, a permit home for the length of their stay and three meals a day in the communal kitchen. The homeless were not the only outside help. Amana would hire many outside laborers to do industrial and agricultural jobs. They worked in the woolen shop, the calico-printing shop or one of the many others. =Worship= Another important governing aspect of the society was the church, which was run by the Board of Trustees. Children and their parents worshiped together. Mothers with young children sat in the back of the church. Other children sat in the first few rows. Men and women were separated during worship: men on one side and women on the other side of the church. Older people and the \\"in-betweens\\" who were people in their thirties and forties had to attend a separate service. The service that members attended and where the members sat was a statement of their status in society. Services were held eleven times a week and did not include musical instruments and hymn singing.Liffring-Zug, Joan. The Amanas Yesterday: A Religious Communal Society. Iowa City: Penfield Press, 1975. =Amana and the outside world = Amana would interact with the outside world in two ways, buying and selling. Each village had a center of exchange where all goods were purchased. By the 1890s, these stores were buying a great amount of goods and raw materials from the outside world. Just Middle Amana alone had more than 732 invoices from outside companies. Amana purchased anything deemed necessary to run the society efficiently, such as raw wool, oil, grease, starch, pipes and fittings. Most of the grain was purchased from the outside for their flour- mill, and the printing establishment used cotton goods from the southern states. This brings into question whether Amana was truly an economically isolated society.Communal societies: Cosgel; Market integration and agricultural efficiency. Volume 13; 1994. =Great Change= In March 1931, in the wake of the Great Depression, the Great Council disclosed to the Amana Society that the villages were in dire financial condition. The Depression was particularly harsh in the Colony because a fire had badly damaged the woolen mill and destroyed the flour mill less than ten years earlier. At the same time, Society members were seeking increased secularism so that they could have more personal freedom. The Society agreed to split into two organizations: The non-profit Amana Church Society oversaw the spiritual needs of the community, while the for-profit Amana Society was incorporated as a joint-stock company. The transition was completed in 1932 and came to be known in the community as the Great Change. Since the Great Change to Amana Colonies, roadside sign Most residents of the Amana Colony are considered tri- lingual. They speak American English, High German (), and a dialect known as Amana German (). The language is High German in origin, but has strong influences of American English. For example, the word for rhubarb is Piestengel, combining the English word \\"pie\\" with the German word for stalk or stem. The Amana Society, Inc., corporate heir to the land and economic assets of communal Amana, continues to own and manage some of farm, pasture and forest land. Agriculture remains an important economic base today just as it was in communal times. Because the land was not divided up with the end of communalism, the landscape of Amana still reflects its communal heritage. In addition, over 450 communal-era buildings stand in the seven villages‚Äîvivid reminders of the past. On June 23, 1965, the National Park Service deemed the Amana Colonies worthy of distinction as a National Historic Landmark. When the National Register of Historic Places was founded a year later, the Colonies were automatically listed. Amana Farms is home to Iowa‚Äôs largest privately held forest. Amana Farms has built a 1.6 million-gallon anaerobic digester with funding from the Iowa Office of Energy Independence, which produces fertilizer, heat for buildings, and methane for generating electricity. The digester processes organic waste streams from industrial partners such as Genencor International, Cargill and the International Paper Cedar River Mill, as well as manure, thereby reducing local methane emissions. =Amana Refrigeration= The most widely known business enterprise that emerged from the Amana Society is Amana Refrigeration, Inc. George C. Foerstner worked in the woolen mill and became a traveling salesman for the mill after the Great Change. With the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, Foerstner recognized the need for beverage coolers. He started the Electric Equipment Company in 1934 using $3500 of his own savings. The company was sold to the Amana Society in 1936 and renamed the Electrical Department of the Amana Society, though Foerstner remained as manager. The company was twice awarded the Army-Navy \\"E\\" Award during World War II for filling military contracts. Goods were produced in the Middle Amana woolen mill. In 1947, the company produced the first commercial upright freezer. Two years later, the Amana Society sold off the Electrical Department to an investment group organized by Foerstner. Renamed Amana Refrigeration, Inc., the company grew to manufacture refrigerators and air conditioners. The Raytheon Corporation purchased Amana Refrigeration on January 1, 1965, although the Amana division was mostly autonomous. Amana produced the first practical commercial microwave oven in 1967. The division was sold to Goodman Global in 1997 and then sold to Maytag in 2001. It became part of the Whirlpool Corporation when it purchased Maytag in 2006. =Tourism= Today, heritage tourism has become important to the economy of the Amana area. There are hotels and bed and breakfasts that support the tourist industry, as well as many independent shops, local artists and craftspeople, and restaurants serving family-style meals. Historic preservation efforts by several local non-profit organizations, as well as the Amana Society, Inc., in conjunction with governmental, land-use and historic preservation ordinances attempt to preserve the natural and built environment of Amana. =Education= Clear Creek‚ÄìAmana Community School District operates public schools serving the community.

Paramotor is the generic name for the harness and propulsive portion of a powered paraglider (\\"PPG\\"). There are two basic types of paramotors: foot launch and wheel launch. Foot launch models consist of a frame with harness, fuel tank, engine, and propeller. A hoop with protective netting primarily keeps lines out of the propeller. The unit is worn like a large backpack to which a Paraglider is attached through carabiners. Wheel launch units either come as complete units with their own motor, or as an add-on to a foot launch paramotor. They usually have 3 (trike) or 4 (quad) wheels, with seats for one or two occupants. These should not be confused with powered parachutes which are generally much heavier, more powerful, and have different steering. The term was first used by Englishman Mike Byrne in 1980 and popularized in France around 1986 when La Mouette began adapting power to the then-new paraglider wings. Power plants are almost exclusively small two-stroke internal combustion engines, between 80 cc and 350 cc, that burn a mixture of gasoline and oil. These engines are favored for their quick high r.p.m. thrust and low weight, using approximately 3.7 litres (1 US Gal.) of fuel per hour depending on paraglider efficiency, the weight of unit plus pilot, and flying weather conditions. At least one manufacturer is producing a 4-stroke model favored for its strong lower r.p.m. thrust and better fuel efficiency. Electrically powered units also exist, though flight duration is considerably limited on the battery's electrical capacity. Csaba Lemak created the first electric PPG, flying it first on 13 June 2006. Wankel rotary engined paramotors are also available, but rare. The pilot controls thrust via a hand-held throttle and steers using the wings brake toggles or stabilo steering, weight shifting or a combination of the three. It is identical to Paragliding except it is powered so the use of an elevation or thermals to ascend are not required. Paramotor wings have evolved specifically for use with power propulsion, as compared with free flight 'paraglider' wings. Such wings are typically designed for a higher speed and may incorporate a \\"reflex\\" profile to aid stability in pitch, an idea taken from hang gliders of the 1980s and developed and pioneered by British designer Mike Campbell-Jones. Paramotor wings typically use trimmers to adjust the Angle of attack of the wing to either slow it down or speed it up in flight. Trimmed out allows the pilot to achieve maximum speed, while trimmed in allows for slower speeds optimized for launching and landing. Generally the trimmers act on the rear of the wing. The angle of attack can also be adjusted by a pully style system, which is activated via a bar pushed by the pilots feet, called a speedbar. This system generally acts on the leading edge of the wing. This system is only activated in-flight, and by default is not activated on takeoff or landing. Due to the torque effect of a motor, this can cause the glider to turn, especially under hard acceleration. Trimmers can be adjusted un-equally to negate this effect. The most difficult aspect of paramotoring is controlling the wing (paraglider) on the ground. This control is both during launch and upon landing. Initial training in becoming a paramotor pilot involves managing the wing in the air from the ground without the motor. This process is called kiting and is the most complicated and important step in the process. Once kiting the wing on the ground is mastered then the motor is added to the process to practice with the weight of the paramotor included. A typical paramotor will weigh on average around 50 lbs. (23 kg) with some models as light at 40 lbs. (18 kg) and some models as high as 75 lbs. (34 kg.) The size of the paramotor wing and engine are dependent on the weight of the pilot. The larger the pilot, the larger the size of the wing and thrust required to launch. Most individuals in reasonably good health can foot-launch a paramotor and there are even pilots with artificial joints foot launching. Individuals that may have issues with the physical aspect of foot launching may opt to add a trike or quad to their paramotor. A trike or quad is a platform to which the paramotor can be attached so it can be launched from wheels like a regular aircraft or powered parachute. This sport has evolved and now many advanced pilots perform extreme maneuvers such as wing-overs, barrel rolls and loops. These types of maneuvers present a significant danger as any type of negative G's encountered will unload the wing allowing the wings lines to go slack. Only very advanced pilots with years of experience, training and coupled with countermeasures such as reserve parachutes should attempt such maneuvers. A reserve parachute is a highly recommended piece of equipment which may prevent significant injury or death in the presence of a malfunction of the equipment or a mistake made by the pilot.

It is also the name of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) program responsible for administering and enforcing the regulatory framework. The core mission of the NOP is to protect the integrity of the USDA organic seal. The seal is used for products adhering to USDA standards that contain at least 95% organic ingredients. The Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 required that the USDA develop national standards for organic products, and the final rule establishing the NOP was first published in the Federal Register in 2000 (December 21, 2000) and is codified in the Code of Federal Regulations at .  Overview  The NOP covers fresh and processed agricultural food products. The National Organic Program grew from fewer than twelve total employees in 2008 to approximately 37 in 2019. As of February 2019, it operates in three divisions in addition to the Office of Deputy Administrator: Standards, Accreditation and International Activities (AIA), and Compliance and Enforcement. The key activities of the National Organic Program are to: * Maintain the Organic Integrity Database, a listing of certified organic operations, and help new farmers and business learn how to get certified * Develop regulations and guidance on organic standards * Manage the National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances * Accredit certifying agents to certify organic producers and handlers * Facilitate the work of the National Organic Standards Board, a Federal Advisory Committee * Provide training to certifying agents, USDA staff, and other stakeholders * Engage and serve the organic community * Investigate alleged violations of the organic standards and bring violators to justice  Regulation  The Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 \\"requires the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances which identifies synthetic substances that may be used, and the nonsynthetic substances that cannot be used, in organic production and handling operations.\\"Text copied from Under this act, the Secretary of Agriculture promulgated regulations establishing the National Organic Program (NOP) in 2000. It restricts the use of the term \\"organic\\" to certified organic producers (excepting growers selling under $5,000 a year, who must still comply and submit to a records audit if requested, but do not have to formally apply). Certification is handled by state, non-profit and private agencies that have been approved by the USDA (see section below). NOP regulations cover in detail all aspects of food production, processing, delivery and retail sale. Under the NOP, farmers and food processors who wish to use the word organic in reference to their businesses and products, must be certified organic. Producers with annual sales not exceeding US$5,000 are exempted and do not require certification (however, they must still follow NOP standards, including keeping records and submitting to a production audit if requested, and cannot use the term certified organic). Products labeled \\"100 percent organic\\", \\"organic\\", or \\"made with organic ingredients\\" must adhere to the Organic Production and Handling Requirements outlined in the regulation 7 CFR Part 205. A USDA Organic seal identifies raw, fresh, and processed products with at least 95% organic ingredients. A product that has not been certified organic by a USDA- authorized certifying agent may not bear the USDA organic seal. Products containing at least 70 percent organically produced ingredients may include a ‚ÄúMade with Organic‚Äù label to specify up to three ingredients or ingredient categories. They can not use the USDA organic seal or represent that the finished product is organic. Misuse of the USDA Organic seal on a product may lead to USDA compliance and enforcement actions, including fines up to $11,000 per violation. Misuse may also lead to the suspension or revocation of the violator's organic certificate.  USDA accredited certifying agents  As of 2019, there are 79 USDA accredited certifying agents (ACAs). The NOP provides organic producers with resources to assist in becoming certified organic, including an organic program handbook (which includes guidance, certifier instructions, and policy memos), fact sheets, online training modules, and ways to identify accredited certifying agents.  International equivalency  Beginning in 2009, the US implemented an international organic equivalency agreement with Canada. In 2012 they implemented an agreement with the European Union (EU-Eco-regulation), and in 2014 with Japan and Korea. Under these agreements, USDA-certified organic products do not need to meet a separate set of standards before being exported to the market, and vice versa, as equivalency agreements essentially imply that the two sets of standards are equivalent despite a few small differences and do not require any additional certification for the specific market. These agreements streamline certification requirements and increase access to new market opportunities, while maintaining organic integrity of the respective markets.  Support and assistance  The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Environmental Quality Incentives (EQIP) Organic Program provides financial and technical assistance to certain organic producers for implementing conservation practices.

It was headed by Kamal Jumblatt, a prominent Druze leader of the Progressive Socialist Party (PSP). The Vice-President was Inaam Raad, leader of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party and Assem Qanso of the pro-Syrian Lebanese Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party. The general secretary of the LNM was Mohsen Ibrahim, leader of the Communist Action Organization in Lebanon (CAOL).Organization for Communist Action, Michele Salkind, Fawwaz Trabulsi, MERIP Reports, No. 61 (Oct., 1977), pp. 5-8+21 The LNM was one of two main coalitions during the first rounds of fighting in the Lebanese Civil War, the other being the militias of the mainly Christian Lebanese Front, which comprised the Phalange, the National Liberal Party and others; as well as parts of the Maronite-dominated central government. Composition The Lebanese National Movement had its genesis in a previous organization, the Front of National and Progressive Parties and Forces ‚Äì FNPPF (Arabic: Jabhat al-Ahzab wa al-Quwa al-Taqaddumiyya wa al-Wataniyya) or \\"Front for Progressive Parties and National Forces\\" (FPPNF), also known as the \\"Revisionist Front\\", an alliance of anti-status quo political parties originally formed in 1969, which later ran in the 1972 general elections on a reformist secular platform. Overwhelmingly left-wing and Pan-Arabist in both its composition and orientation, the LNM claimed to be a \\"democratic, progressive and non- sectarian\\" broad organization that gatherered parties and organizations opposing the Maronite-dominated sectarian order in Lebanon. It was reorganized as the Lebanese National Movement (LNM) in the 1970s, and led by Kamal Jumblatt as the main force on the anti-government side in the early years of the Lebanese Civil War. Among the members were the Progressive Socialist Party (PSP), the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP), the Lebanese Communist Party (LCP) and several Nasserist groups. It was also joined by Palestinian factions based in Lebanon's refugee camps, mainly from the Rejectionist Front. =Membership and political organization= Its membership was overwhelmingly left-wing and professed to be secular, although the fairly obvious sectarian appeal of Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party (PSP) and some of the Sunni Arab nationalist organizations in some cases made this claim debatable. However, to say that the LNM was an all-Muslim organization would be a gross oversimplification. Its main ideological positions were: the abrogation of sectarianism, political and social reforms, the clear proclamation of the Arab identity of Lebanon, and increased support for the Palestinians. In order to coordinate the military and political actions of the LNM an executive structure, the Central Political Council ‚Äì CPC (Arabic: Majliss Tajammu al- kinda) or Bureau Politique Central (BPC) in French, was set up shortly after the outbreak of the hostilities at the town of Aley, a mountain tourist resort in the Chouf District, which became the military headquarters of the Front. The Council was presided over from its inception by Kamal Jumblatt of the PSP, with Mohsen Ibrahim of the OCAL appointed as Executive Secretary; after Kamal's death in 1977, he was replaced by his son Walid Jumblatt, who led the LNM until 1982. Among the participants in the LNM were the Lebanese Communist Party (LCP), the Communist Action Organization in Lebanon (CAOL or OCAL), the PSP, the Syrian Social Nationalist Party in Lebanon (SSNP), both a Syrian-led Ba'ath Party branch and an Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party branch, al-Mourabitoun (a Nasserist group) and several other minor Nasserist groupings. Several Palestinian organizations joined the LNM, notably many from the Rejectionist Front. Both the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) were active participants. The Shia Amal Movement, although supporting some of the LNM's positions, did not join it formally. Amal Movement, 30 years after its foundation =Minor groups= Above and beyond this, an 'alphabet soup' of other lesser-known smaller Parties were associated with the LNM, namely the Revolutionary Communist Group ‚Äì RCG, the Lebanese Revolutionary Party ‚Äì LRP, the Front of Patriotic Christians ‚Äì PFC, the Democratic Lebanese Movement ‚Äì DLM, the Movement of Arab Lebanon ‚Äì MAL, the Arab Revolutionary Movement ‚Äì ARM, the Partisans of the Revolution, the Vanguards of Popular Action ‚Äì VPA, the Organization of Arab Youth ‚Äì OAY, the Units of the Arab Call ‚Äì UAC, the Movement of Arab Revolution ‚Äì MAR, the Sixth of February Movement, the 24 October Movement ‚Äì 24 OM, the Lebanese Movement in Support of Fatah ‚Äì LMSF, the Union of Working People's Forces ‚Äì UWPF, the Union of Working People's Forces-Corrective Movement ‚Äì UWPF-CM, the Knights of Ali, the Black Panthers, etc. Most of them were marginal political organizations of revolutionary or populist trend (Arab nationalist, libertarian/anarchist, liberal/idealist, radical socialist, Marxist‚ÄìLeninist, Hoxhaist, Trotskyist, or Maoist) that emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and despite their rather limited base of support, they were quite active. Anti-status quo, Pan-Arabist, and pro-Palestinian in policy, they strived for a social revolution that would transform Lebanese society, therefore sharing the same objectives as the leading LNM secular parties ‚Äì the recognition of Lebanon as an Arab country and unwavering support for the PLO. However, apart this minority of committed idealists, the vast majority of the remainder 'movements' were actually fa√ßades or 'shops' (Arabic: dakakin) ‚Äì slightly politicised neighbourhood militias operating under grandiose pseudo-revolutionary labels ‚Äì set up by PLO factions (mainly Fatah) in a misguided effort to widen its base of local support among the unemployed Lebanese urban youth. In most cases, their small, poorly disciplined, ill-equipped militia establishments were ad hoc formations made of lightly armed and largely untrained Christian or Muslim youths that rarely surpassed the 100-300 fighters' mark ‚Äì about the size of an understrength company or battalion. Some groupings were lucky enough to possess a few technicals armed with heavy machine-guns and recoilless rifles but others, for the most part, fought on foot as light infantry, with small arms pilfered from the government forces, acquired on the black market or obtained via the Palestinian factions. Those groups either unable or unwilling to raise their own militias played a political role only by engaging in propaganda activities, keeping themselves out of the 1975-76 savage street battles and sectarian killings, with some of their militants preferring instead to join the medical relief agencies organized by the LNM. The decline of the LNM in the late 1970s, culminating in its collapse in the aftermath of the Israeli invasion of June 1982, sounded the death toll for many of the minor Lebanese leftist organizations. As the war progressed, many of these small factions ‚Äì at least the more politically oriented ones ‚Äì were destroyed in the violent power struggles of the 1980s. For the most part forced to go underground, some evolved to Islamic fundamentalist groups, whilst the less politicized simply degenerated into criminal street-gangs that engaged in assassinations, theft, smuggling, and extortion. As a result, only a small fraction of the truly ideologically committed groupings managed to survive the war to re-emerge in the 1990s as politically active organizations. =Military strength and organization= At the beginning of the war in 1975 the different LNM militias were grouped into a military wing, designated the \\"Common Forces\\" (Arabic: ÿßŸÑŸÇŸàÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ¥ÿ™ÿ±ŸÉÿ©, Al-Quwwat al-Mushtaraka), but best known as \\"Joint Forces\\" (LNM-JF), which numbered some 18,700 militiamen (not including allied Palestinian factions). Manpower was distributed as follows: the PSP militia (the People's Liberation Army) and the LCP militia (the Popular Guard) each had 5,000 men; the SSNP militia had 4,000 men; and the pro-Iraqi Ba'athists, the pro-Syria Ba'athists, and al-Mourabitoun militia 3,000 each. The others militias shared the remainder. Eventually, this number was due to increase in the following months with the inclusion of 23,900 Palestinian guerrilla fighters from both the Rejectionist Front (RF) and mainstream PLO factions, later joined by 4,400 Lebanese regular soldiers from the Lebanese Arab Army (LAA) led by Lt. Ahmad al-Khatib who went over to the LNM-PLO side in January 1976. In the end, the LNM-PLO-LAA combined military forces reached an impressive total of 46,900 left-wing troops by March that year, aligned against the 15,000-18,000 right-wing troops their Lebanese Front adversaries were able to muster. =Sponsor countries and organizations= The LNM-JF received financial aid and arms from many countries such as Syria, Libya, Iraq and South Yemen, in addition to Palestinian support; besides lending their political backing and contributing with their organizational skills, experienced Palestinian cadres from RF and PLO groups provided weapons, equipment, and in many cases, military leadership to the Lebanese leftist militias. In addition, they also provided training, which was conducted at the refugee camps in the major cities or at PLO bases in southern Lebanon, mainly in the Beqaa Valley (a.k.a. \\"Fatahland\\"). Participation in the Lebanese Civil War 1975-1982 As fighting escalated, the LNM allied itself with the umbrella Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and by early 1976 the LNM controlled 80% of Lebanon's territory.Fawwaz Traboulsi, \\"La r√©forme par les armes\\" But as its relations with Damascus deteriorated, the pro-Syrian Ba'ath branch, Union of Working People's Forces and an important SSNP faction left the movement, and formed alongside Amal Movement the Front of Patriotic and National Parties. In June 1976, the Syrian Army, fearing that a Palestinian victory would weaken its own strategic position, received a request from the Lebanese Front to intervene on their behalf.Investigating Bashir Gemayel Part I: Bashir and the Israelis After strong initial resistance, the LNM/PLO forces began losing ground, and once the Arab states eventually approved the Syrian intervention after the Cairo and Riyadh conferences, the common forces accepted a cease-fire. The Syrian Army then took the role of peace-keepers, as part of Arab League's Arab Deterrent Force (ADF), between the belligerents. In 1977, Walid Jumblatt became the head of the LNM after the murder of his resigning father, Kamal, in an ambush widely accredited to either pro-Syrian Palestinian militants or Lebanese SSNP agents working for the Syrian intelligence services.Collelo, Lebanon: A Country Study (1989), p. 241.Rabinovich, The War for Lebanon (1989), p. 77.Menargues, Les Secrets de la guerre du Liban (2004), p. 50. Despite this, Walid aligned himself with Syria, and maintained a good working relationship with Syrian President Hafez Al- Assad (who had shared with his father a mutual distrust). In 1978 the Israeli Operation Litani in southern Lebanon was partly directed against LNM militias, then fighting alongside the PLO after relations improved with Syria. In June 1982, the Movement was virtually dissolved after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and replaced by the Lebanese National Resistance Front ‚Äì LNRF (, Jabhat al-Muqawama al-Wataniyya al-Lubnaniyya), which commenced resistance operations against the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in September of that same year.

It was produced by Walden Media and Walt Disney Pictures. Cameron teams with NASA scientists to explore the mid-ocean ridges, submerged chains of mountains in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans that are home to some of the planet's more unusual forms of life. It was released on DVD on November 1, 2005. Synopsis Cameron joins up aboard the Russian research vessel Akademik Mstislav Keldysh with a group of NASA scientists, as well as some American marine biologists, to investigate ten hydrothermal vents in both the Atlantic and Pacific. The vents have their own unique ecosystem, which support diverse organisms such as giant tube worms, swarms of blind white crabs, and vast amounts of shrimp which are capable of \\"seeing\\" water that is heated by the vents. These creatures do not require sunlight like other organisms, and instead obtain their energy from the vents. They are able to survive in the superheated and sulfurous water. Because of this, the documentary suggests that this is what life beyond Earth might look like. As some alien ecosystems are likely to be a lot harsher than a typical terrestrial ecosystem, these exotic vents provide an insight into some of the forms that alien life might take. The documentary shows Cameron's passion for exploring the oceans, as well as his interest in extraterrestrial life. It also showcases the technology employed to reach such depths. The film is similar to Cameron's earlier documentary, Ghosts of the Abyss (2003), which involves him journeying to the wreck of the RMS Titanic. It too was filmed in the 3-D IMAX format.

She was the first ship named for Lieutenant Joseph B. Smith. Entering service in 1909, the destroyer was placed in reserve in 1912. She was reactivated for World War I and, following the war, was used as a test ship for aerial bombing. In 1921, the vessel was sold for scrapping. Construction and career Smith was laid down on 18 March 1908, by William Cramp & Sons, Philadelphia, and launched on 20 April 1909, sponsored by Mrs. Edward Bridge Richardson. She was commissioned on 26 November 1909, with Lieutenant Commander D. F. Boyd in command. Smith was attached to the Atlantic Torpedo Fleet upon commissioning and, after three years of active service, was placed in reserve in October 1912. Reactivated with reduced complements in December 1915, for Neutrality Patrol duty off Boston, Massachusetts, Smith arrived in New Orleans, Louisiana on 10 December, for recruiting duty with the Naval Auxiliary Reserve. She arrived at Key West, Florida on 12 February 1916, and at New York, on 15 February, to continue recruiting duty. =World War I= With war imminent, Smith was ordered on 1 April 1917, to anchor in the North River, to assist the Collector of Customs in preventing the German ships at New York from escaping or destroying themselves. She departed New York, on 4 April, and operated with the Patrol Force along the East Coast from 10 April-14 May. On 17 April, she reported sighting a submarine which submerged, and then saw a torpedo wake cross her bow; however, neither inflicted damage on the other. Smith underwent overhaul at the Charleston Navy Yard from 17 May-16 July, during which time she prepared for distant service. Smith departed Charleston, South Carolina on 16 July, and after a stop at Bermuda from 18‚Äì20 July, and three months of patrols in the Azores from 26 July-5 October, she arrived at Brest, France on 20 October. For the remainder of the war, Smith escorted eastbound and westbound convoys through the submarine danger area extending about to the westward of Brest. Her escort missions were largely uneventful and, despite several sightings of suspected submarines, she made no confirmed kills. She was called upon twice, however, to rescue survivors of torpedoed transports. On 31 May 1918, she rescued 240 men from , and, while carrying them into port, unsuccessfully attacked a submarine on 1 June. On 1 July, she rescued survivors from Covington while other destroyers circled the two ships at high speed to deter submarine attack. =Inter-war period= Smith underwent repairs in England from 16 September-3 November, and after the end of the war, at Brest, from 7 March-2 April 1919. She sailed for the United States on 11 May; and, after arriving at Philadelphia, was decommissioned there on 2 September. She was ordered sold on 28 February 1920, but was withdrawn from sale on 9 June, in response to a request from the Bureau of Construction and Repair for a destroyer, a submarine, and a battleship for exhaustive bombing experiments.

Historically in Lancashire, it is bordered by the suburbs of Aigburth, Allerton, and Speke.  History  In medieval times, Garston was home to a group of Benedictine monks. The first recorded mention of settlement in Garston is of the Church of St Michael in 1235. By the 19th century, the area had become a small village, one of the eight townships forming the parish of Childwall. A small dock was first built at Garston in 1793 for Blackburne's Saltworks, which still stands today. Garston's growth accelerated rapidly in the 1840s, when in 1846, the area's first dock was constructed and opened, under the auspices of the St Helens and Runcorn Gap Railway Company. The \\"Old Dock\\" was followed twenty years later by a second, the \\"North Dock.\\" The third and final dock, Stalbridge, was opened in 1907. In 1902, Garston was incorporated into the City of Liverpool. The population expanded as migrants flooded in to work on the docks, especially from Ireland. Description Today, Garston is a major shipping and container port, with the Port of Garston second only to Liverpool Docks in the North-West. Although inside the city of Liverpool, Garston Docks are not a part of the Port of Liverpool and is regarded as a separate port. Much of the area is also residential, housing being mainly in Victorian terraces with semi-detached homes around Liverpool South Parkway. Garston is partnered with the nearby district of Speke in a series of redevelopment and regeneration schemes, which have succeeded in reversing trends in dereliction and unemployment. Garston is regularly quoted as one of Liverpool's 'up and coming' areas because of this, and house prices have continued to rise. Since the demolition of the Red Lion Inn, the oldest remaining buildings in Garston are Seafield Cottages, a row of four cottages on Chapel Road, which date back to at least the 1730s. Etymology Grazing settlement root Gaerstun, meaning 'grazing settlement' or 'grazing farm' in Old English, is one possible root of the name. Garston as a name of a place may have its etymology informed by both Old English and Norse. The area that Garston was part of during the Viking Danelaw period would have been influenced by Norse speech. When Vikings settled they would sometimes change names because of speech difficulties. For example, the Saxon name for the city Eoforwic was changed to Jorvik. Shelton, was altered to Skelton, though the old English of 'ton' meaning settlement was retained attesting to the development of language over time. Spear root Gar', from Old English (spear, dart, javelin, shaft, arrow, weapon) from Norwegian and Icelandic (spear) and Old Norse geirr (spear, arrow), may suggest that the name of Garston is a combination of Viking and Old English. Another meaning of the name has been suggested as being Gar' (Great) ston' (stone). Therefore meaning \\"Great Stone\\". A name possibly meaning the place where spears or arrows were made. In the Anglo Saxon period the forests belong to landowners and their subjects. It wasn't until the coming of William in 1066 that the 'Forest Law' was introduced which claimed woodland as the hunting grounds for kings. Woodland covered approximately 15% of England in 1086 (this had dwindled to just 5.3% in 1905). Neither of these names may be exclusive and whilst they may have a different etymological ancestry they may simply because of the way language develops have a common history. The etymology of 'garden' is the same as yard and garth and derives from the Old English 'geard', meaning enclosure or hedge. So a hedged enclosure is the exact definition of a garden just as it is of a field. Etymological conclusions Geardton (Old English field) or Geirrton (Old Norse spear) or Garton (Old English spear, weapon), all omit the S. S is used in Modern English to suggest plural and possessive. Nouns, noun phrases and some pronouns generally form a possessive with the suffix 's'. This form, is sometimes called the Saxon genitive, reflecting the suffix's derivation from a genitive case ending in Old English (Anglo-Saxon; a clitic). This suggests at least two possible roots. Firstly one based on grazing as not geographically specific, unlikely to be fenced in, within the periods we are dealing with and secondly one based on specific activity or activities at a given point in a general location spear or arrow or weapon making, which is linked to a settlement, So a settlement where arrows were made is Geirr(s)ton or as it is now known, Garston, e.g. \\"the place of the arrows\\". Transport Garston is home to Liverpool South Parkway railway station, a major new interchange station opened in 2006 replacing Garston (1874-2006). Trains operate at regular intervals to the city centre, Southport, Manchester and Birmingham, and other locations. The 86 and 86A bus routes provide regular bus services from Liverpool South Parkway to the surrounding districts and the city centre. A regular bus shuttle to Liverpool John Lennon Airport is available from Liverpool South Parkway railway station. Attractions Garston was home to the 'New Slaughterhouse Gallery' on St. Mary's Road, which aimed to promote local artists as well as community regeneration in partnership with the Garston Embassy on Wellington Street but is now closed. Cressington and Grassendale Parks are nearby, and there is a public swimming pool on Long Lane. A former venue, the Winter Gardens (since demolished), opposite the police station in Heald Street, hosted concerts, dances and other public events.Winter Gardens: Football In 1935, when Garston and indeed much of the south of Liverpool was expanding due to the mass development of council housing to replace inner city slums, as well as the significant development of private housing, the new South Liverpool F.C. was formed in 1935 to serve the area and set up base at the Holly Park stadium in Garston. The club went on to win the Welsh Cup in 1939 (despite being an English side and playing in the English non-league systems) and won a host of non-league football competitions over the next 50 years. However, they were forced to sell Holly Park after a fire in 1989 and folded in 1991, only to reform as a junior side in a host of locations in and around the city before settling at a site in Otterspool in 2000. Although South Liverpool were never successful in their many applications to join the Football League, many of their players went on to play for Football League sides; most notably striker John Aldridge and midfielder Jimmy Case, who won major trophies in the great Liverpool sides of the 1970s and 1980s. Aldridge, locally born but of Irish descent, was also a Republic of Ireland international regular in the late 1980s and early to mid-1990s, representing his adopted country at two World Cups.

The Rhine transmitter was established in 1950 and went on the air May 15, 1950. It belongs to SWR (until 1998 to SWF) and transmitted until the middle of the 1990s with 600 kilowatts. In the last years the transmission power was reduced to 100 kilowatts. From 1950 to 2003 two 150-metre-high guyed steel tube masts were used as the transmission aerial, which are insulated from ground and which were separated by an insulator in the mast construction electrically in two parts for double feeding as fade reducing aerial. By the usage of two masts a direction minimum toward the southeast was obtained according to international regulations when working with a transmission power of 600 kilowatts at nighttime. Furthermore, there is a 114-metre-tall guyed steel tube mast, which is also insulated against ground. This mast, which is used as reserve antenna for medium wave broadcasting, has an FM-transmission antenna on its top. Furthermore, there is also a free-standing grounded lattice tower used for radio services in UHF/VHF-ranges. After transmission power was reduced to 100 kilowatts a direction minimum toward the southeast was no longer necessary and running the transmitter with omnidirectional radiation was possible. Hence the second radio mast was obsolete and was demolished on February 26, 2003. On the remaining radio mast of the Rhine transmitter there are also aerials for FM broadcasting for SWR 4 on 94.9 MHz. At the site of the demolished radio mast, a further grounded free-standing lattice tower was built in 2003. On this tower in 2004 a cage antenna was installed, which is used for broadcasting the SWR program \\"Das Ding\\" in the DRM-mode on 1485 kHz with an output power on 1 kW.

Life He was born in Asfordby, Leicestershire, on 16 August 1732,Parish register the eldest son and namesake of the Reverend Andrew Burnaby, a well-to-do clergyman of the Church of England. The young Burnaby attended Westminster School, and then Queens' College, Cambridge, where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1754 and his master's degree in 1757. After taking his B.A., he was ordained. Shortly afterward he toured America, a trip which he later wrote up as a celebrated travelogue Travels Through the Middle Settlements in North America, In the Years 1759 and 1760, which was published in 1775, and again in an enlarged form in 1798. He wrote about all of the things he saw in the colonies. His book avoids all mention of the major political developments of the time, such as the American Revolution. After his return to Europe, he became Chaplain to the British mission at Leghorn in 1762.

Though short-lived, it gave its name to several later newspapers, notably the Merkuriusz Polski published in London, 1955‚Äì58. History Merkuryusz Polski Ordynaryiny first came out in Krak√≥w on 3 January 1661. Sponsored by the court of King John II Casimir of Poland and his consort Queen Marie Louise Gonzaga, the newspaper was a weekly devoted chiefly to contemporary politics, European dynastic affairs, and monarchs' military campaigns. With regard to internal affairs, it promoted political reforms and the strengthening of monarchical power. Its demise was associated with the failure of the king's political plans. Merkuryusz was edited in a 17th-century Polish heavily influenced by Latin; some parts of issues were written purely in Latin. Initially published by the Krak√≥w printing house of J.A.

Symptoms of bronchospasm include shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing and chest tightness. It is also used to prevent breathing difficulties during exercise (exercise-induced bronchoconstriction). It was patented in 1983 and came into medical use in 1990. It is marketed as Serevent in the US. It is available as a dry-powder inhaler (DPI) that releases a powdered form of the drug. It was previously available as a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) but was discontinued in the US in 2002. It is available as an MDI in other countries as of 2020.  Mechanism of action  Inhaled salmeterol belongs to a group of drugs called beta-2 agonists. These drugs stimulate beta-2 receptors present in the bronchial musculature. This causes them to relax and prevent the onset and worsening of symptoms of asthma. They act on the enzyme adenyl cyclase which increases the concentration of cAMP(cyclic AMP). This cyclic AMP decreases the smooth muscle tone. It has a long duration of action as it is lipophilic. The drug goes inside the lung cells and releases itself over a period of time to act on the beta-2 receptors. The primary noticeable difference of salmeterol from salbutamol, and other short-acting Œ≤2 adrenoreceptor agonists (SABAs), is its duration of action. Salmeterol lasts approximately 12 hours in comparison with salbutamol, which lasts about 4-6 hours. When used regularly every day as prescribed, inhaled salmeterol decreases the number and severity of asthma attacks. However, like all LABA medications, it is not for use in relieving an asthma attack that has already started. Formoterol has been demonstrated to have a faster onset of action than salmeterol as a result of a lower lipophilicity, and has also been demonstrated to be more potent--a 12 ¬µg dose of formoterol has been demonstrated to be equivalent to a 50 ¬µg dose of salmeterol. Medical uses * Salmeterol is used in moderate-to-severe persistent asthma following previous treatment with a short-acting Œ≤2 adrenoreceptor agonist (SABA) such as salbutamol (albuterol). * LABAs should not be used as a monotherapy, instead, they should be used concurrently with an inhaled corticosteroid, such as beclometasone dipropionate or fluticasone propionate in the treatment of asthma to minimize serious reactions such as asthma-related deaths. Combination of inhaled corticosteroids and salmeterol (LABA) has synergistic action and reduces the frequency of asthma attacks and also makes it less severe. * In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), LABAs may be used as monotherapy or in combination with corticosteroids. The Torch study demonstrated benefits in terms of quality of life and lung function of salmeterol alone or in combination with inhaled corticosteroids in patients with COPD * In exercise-induced bronchospasm monotherapy may be indicated in patients without persistent asthma. LABAs should not be used to treat acute symptoms. =Pregnancy and lactation= Salmeterol use during pregnancy must be decided based on the risks versus benefits to the mother. There are no well-controlled studies with salmeterol in pregnant women. Some animal studies showed developmental malformation when the mother was given several clinical doses orally. In rats, salmeterol xinafoate is excreted in the milk. However, since there are no data to show excretion of salmeterol in a mother's breast milk, a decision on whether to continue or discontinue therapy should be decided based on the important benefits it provides to the mother. Pregnant and lactating women should consult their doctors before using salmeterol. Side effects Due to its vasodilation properties, the common side effects of salmeterol are * dizziness, * sinus infection, and * migraine headaches. Other side effects * muscle tremors, * hypokalemia due to direct effect on beta-2 receptors on skeletal muscle. In most cases, salmeterol side effects are minor and either do not require treatment or can easily be treated. Certain side effects, however, should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately. Some of these more serious side effects include * very fast heart rate, * high blood pressure, and * worsening breathing problems. Structure-activity relationship Salmeterol has an aryl alkyl group with a chain length of 11 atoms from the amine. This bulkiness makes the compound more lipophilic and it also makes it selective to Œ≤2 adrenergic receptors. History Previously used metered-dose inhaler of Serevent-brand salmeterol A typical dry-powder inhaler salmeterol \\"diskus\\" Salmeterol, first marketed and manufactured by Glaxo (now GlaxoSmithKline, GSK) in the 1980s, was released as Serevent in 1990. The product is marketed by GSK under the Allen & Hanburys brand in the UK. In November 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration released a health advisory, alerting the public to findings that show the use of long-acting Œ≤2 agonists could lead to a worsening of symptoms, and in some cases death. While the use of inhaled LABAs are still recommended in asthma guidelines for the resulting improved symptom control,British Thoracic Society & Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). British Guideline on the Management of Asthma. Guideline No. 63. Edinburgh:SIGN; 2004. (HTML , Full PDF , Summary PDF ) further concerns have been raised. A large meta-analysis of pooled results from 19 trials with 33,826 participants, suggests that salmeterol may increase the small risks of asthma-related deaths, and this additional risk is not reduced with the additional use of inhaled steroids (e.g., as with the combination product fluticasone/salmeterol). This seems to occur because although LABAs relieve asthma symptoms, they also promote bronchial inflammation and sensitivity without warning.  Society and culture  = Names = Combinations of inhaled steroids and these long-acting bronchodilators are becoming more widespread; the most common combination currently in use is fluticasone/salmeterol (brand names Seretide (UK) and Advair (US)). Another combination is budesonide/formeterol (brand name Symbicort).  See also  * Vilanterol ‚Äî an ultra-long-acting Œ≤2 adrenoreceptor agonist with a similar chemical structure.

Origin La Prairie, Quebec. The C&SL; was financed by Montreal entrepreneur and brewery owner, John Molson. It was intended as a portage road to connect the St. Lawrence River valley with Lake Champlain, cutting time from the trip between Montreal and New York. Construction began in January, 1835 when surveyors determined the line would run from St. John on the Richelieu River to the nearest point on the St. Lawrence at La Prairie, across the river from Montreal. Throughout 1835 the grading, fencing, masonry and bridge work were completed, as well as stations and wharves at Laprairie and St. John. Orders were also placed for a locomotive, which was to be built in Newcastle upon Tyne, as well as four passenger cars, which were to be built in the United States. Several freight cars were also built in Montreal. The line was built as a railway, with rails consisting of pine logs (squared off) which were joined by iron splice plates and bolts laid across wood cross-ties. The pine rails were protected by iron straps spiked to the upper surface. These rails remained the same until being replaced by completely iron rails in the 1850s. British North America's first locomotive arrived at Molson's wharf in Montreal in June 1836. It was named Dorchester and had been constructed by Robert Stephenson, son of George Stephenson who was the manufacturer of The Rocket. A wood-burning 0-4-0 design, it was the 127th locomotive built by Stephenson and was nicknamed \\"Kitten\\" by those who observed its uneven \\"skittish\\" ride ‚Äì a result of the short wheelbase. Trial runs took place at night to avoid frightening the public; maximum speed was approximately . The C&SL; opened to great fanfare on July 21, 1836 with several distinguished guests in attendance besides Molson, including Lord Gosford, the Lieutenant-Governor of Lower Canada, as well as Louis-Joseph Papineau, the rebel politician. Over 300 guests crowded the passenger cars in Laprairie station for the first run. The Dorchester was unable to handle such a load, therefore the two first-class coaches carrying 32 of the distinguished guests were uncoupled and hauled by the locomotive while the remaining cars were hauled by teams of horses. Two hours later, everyone was at the station in St. John where the ceremonies continued. in 1999, the Dorchester was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame. Due to its unique status as the first locomotive used in Canada, it was recognized for its contribution to the railway industry as \\"Rolling Stock\\" in the \\"National\\" category.The North America Railway Hall of Fame Growth and eventual merging Regular operations commenced on July 25 and while freight traffic was stagnant on the line for many years, passenger traffic and excursions proved extremely popular early on, with many extra passenger trains being hauled by horses until additional locomotives arrived in 1837. Charles Dickens even rode the line. The line was extended south along the Richelieu River valley in 1851 to Rouses Point, New York and the following year saw a more direct routing built from the St. John-Laprairie line to St. Lambert, directly opposite Montreal to avoid the indirect journey up and down the St. Lawrence River from Laprairie. This latter line effectively reduced the line into Laprairie to branch line status and it would be later abandoned. The C&SL; merged with the Montreal and New York Railroad in 1857, formerly known as the Montreal and Lachine Railroad, with the new company being named the Montreal and Champlain Railroad. The Grand Trunk Railway leased the M&C; in 1864 and purchased it outright in 1872. In 1923 the GTR was nationalized and the ex-M&C;, n√©e-C&SL; trackage was incorporated into the Canadian National Railways (CNR). CN (post-1960) continues to operate the majority of this historic route, running from an interchange connection with the Delaware and Hudson Railway (now owned by Canadian Pacific Railway) at Rouses Point, New York, through Saint-Jean and on to Saint-Lambert. The line from Rouses Point to Brossard is now CN's Rouses Point Subdivision. Culture C&SL; Railroad was immortalized by Canadian country music artist Orval Prophet on his \\"Judgement Day Express\\" album (1973) with the song \\"Champlain and St. Lawrence Line\\" In 1986, for the World's Fair Exhibition in Vancouver called Expo 86, the Molsons donated a functional replica of the steam engine used to ferry travellers and goods on the C&SL; Railway.

Fictional character biography Demogoblin was originally an unnamed demon who inhabited Limbo and was banished there eons ago for unknown reasons. His essence was fused with the Hobgoblin (Jason Macendale) when Jason asked N'astirh for more power in exchange for his soul.Spectacular Spider-Man #147 As a part of Hobgoblin, he infected Moon Knight with a demonic virus that would slowly mutate him,Marc Spector: Moon Knight #33 and fought the Ghost Rider and John Blaze, eventually being defeated by Blaze's hellfire gun and Ghost Rider's mystical chain.Ghost Rider vol. 3 #17 Hobgoblin quickly realized being possessed by a demon was less than beneficial, and, thanks to the effects of the hellfire and mystical chain, managed to expel his demon half, creating the Demogoblin, a darker, mystical version of the Hobgoblin persona.Web of Spider-Man #86-87 Demogoblin believed himself to be on a holy mission, and killed everyone whom he deemed a sinner. However, his definition of sinner is extreme and excludes only children. He often tried to kill heroes and even holy men. He claimed that he was a member of a demonic group known as the 'Righteous' - demons who sought redemption for their sins as self-proclaimed servants of the Lord by exterminating other demons and destroying evil wherever they found it. Once freed from the Hobgoblin, Demogoblin next fought and was defeated by Spider-Man and Macendale, as the Hobgoblin.Spider-Man #24 He then joined with the Spider-Man doppelganger and tried to kill the Hobgoblin, but they retreated under the sewer depths when opposed by Spider-Man, Venom, Ghost Rider, and Blaze.Web of Spider-Man #93-96; Spirits of Vengeance #5 Demogoblin then confronted Moon Knight, trying to possess his body, which was ravaged by Demogoblin's bloodlink virus from the previous confrontation with the Hobgoblin.

He is summoned to San Francisco by a horde of goblins who held the city in their grip and intend to make Demogoblin their ruler. However, he regards the goblins as sinners of the worst sort, and so plays along with them only long enough to kill Charles Palentine, the man who had summoned the goblins to Earth, and seize from him the necklace used for the summoning. He then uses the necklace's near godlike power to kill all the goblins and destroys the necklace itself, thus saving the city.Venom: The Enemy Within #2-3 Demogoblin's physical form is killed in a final showdown with Hobgoblin, who has gained greater strength than before.

He is endowed with superhuman strength, stamina, agility, reflexes, and resistance to injury. He has a magical ability to mentally control and levitate his one-man miniature \\"goblin glider\\" composed of hellfire and propel it at high speeds. He can project hellfire from his hands. He can also summon demons from hell that will attack anyone he instructs to be destroyed. Demogoblin is able to mystically create \\"pumpkin bombs\\", similar to those of the Green Goblin or Hobgoblin. Orange pumpkin bombs are bombs that explode conventionally (albeit magical) as concussion and incendiary Jack O' Lanterns. Black pumpkin bombs cause their target to be overwhelmed by massive feelings of despair and helplessness. He also can create wraith-shaped smoke and gas-emitting bombs, and bat-shaped razor-edged throwing blades. Apart from his physical and magical advantages, he is knowledgeable about military training and hand-to-hand combat absorbed from his time merged with the Hobgoblin.

Although the group was successful in overthrowing Mobutu, the alliance fell apart after Kabila did not agree to be dictated by his foreign backers, Rwanda and Uganda, which marked the beginning of the Second Congo War in 1998. The alliance is also frequently called by its original French name, Alliance des Forces D√©mocratiques pour la Lib√©ration du Congo-Za√Øre (AFDL). Background By the middle of 1996, the situation in eastern Zaire was simmering with tension. Following the Rwandan genocide in 1994, hundreds of thousands of ethnic Hutus had fled across the border into Zaire where they settled in large refugee camps. Many of those responsible for the genocide, the former Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR) and interahamwe militia, used the anonymity offered by the camps to reorganize into the rebel Rassemblement pour le Retour et la D√©mocratie au Rwanda (RDR). The RDR began to use the camps as bases to infiltrate back across the border and conduct an insurgency. Despite protests by the new government of Rwanda, the Zairian government and international organizations providing humanitarian aid to the camps were unwilling to remove the militants from the refugee population. At the same time, the position of the Banyamulenge minority, ethnic Tutsis who had lived in Zaire for generations, was growing precarious. They had long been discriminated against for being relative newcomers to the region and having a different language and culture than neighboring tribes, part of Mobutu Sese Seko's strategy of encouraging a low level of internal discord in the country so an alliance would not form against him. The arrival of large numbers of Hutus, many of them militant Hutus who carried out attacks on Banyamulenge targets, had substantially upset what equilibrium existed. The Rwandan government also saw the Banyamulenge, as natural allies and had quietly armed and trained a substantial force in anticipation of what it felt to be an unstable situation.  Formation of the AFDL  On 7 October 1996, the vice-governor based in the Kivu town of Bukavu proclaimed that the Banyamulenge were no longer welcome and would have to leave the country. In response, the Banyamulenge began an uprising against the local government, which was used as a pretext by the AFDL to start a war in Zaire, which was initially characterized as a tribal war quickly turned into something more. With support from the Rwandan government, the Banyamulenge managed to fend off an attack by the Zairian Armed Forces. The rising tension between Rwanda and Zaire then led to an exchange of mortar fire over Lake Kivu between the two nations' armed forces. This violence involving the Banyamulenge in September‚ÄìOctober 1996 is seen as the beginning of the First Congo War. Seemingly out of nowhere, Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila, a former Marxist rebel who had spent most of the previous decade selling gold in Tanzania, appeared as head of his old rebel group, the Party of the Peoples' Revolution, which had been defunct. In a remarkably short period of time, Kabila found himself head of the new the AFDL, which also included the National Council of Resistance for Democracy (CNRD) led by Andr√© Kisase Ngandu, the Revolutionary Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MRLZ) led by Anselme Masasu Nindaga, and the Democratic Alliance of the People (ADP) led by D√©ogratias Bugera, often known as \\"Douglas\\". On October 18, a North Kivu Tutsi, D√©ogratias Bugera, became the first general secretary of the organization. There has been much speculation about foreign involvement in facilitating the creation of the AFDL. Most of it swirls around Rwandan President Paul Kagame and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, both of whom knew Kabila very well. (Kabila had been introduced to Kagame and Museveni by Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, president of Tanzania). After an initial period of denial, since 1997 both Rwanda and Uganda have openly acknowledged the role they played in the formation of the AFDL and its military success. Rwanda and Uganda quickly threw the weight of their support behind the AFDL and sent forces across the Zairian border. Burundi, Angola, the rebels of southern Sudan, and the security forces of the province of Katanga, all of which had long-standing grievances with the Mobutu government, especially his sponsoring of foreign rebel groups to destabilize neighboring countries, also proved to be important backers of the AFDL.  The course of the war  One of the first actions of the AFDL after it began to capture towns along the Zairian border was the dispersal of the large Hutu refugee camps that were offering safe haven to many RDR militants, an act humanitarian and human rights organizations fiercely criticized. As each camp was destroyed, the refugees fled to the next, creating camps with massive populations. One camp at Mugungu, north of Lake Kivu, reached 500,000 inhabitants, which is completely unmanageable by humanitarian organizations. However, in fierce fighting in mid-November the Zairian government forces and RDR were either destroyed or forced out of the provinces of North and South Kivu. The Hutu refugees then split, about 800,000 fleeing back into Rwanda and several hundred thousand moving west into the Zairian jungles where many died of starvation and exposure to the elements or fell victim to attacks by various armed parties. The Rwandan Defence Forces and the AFDL carried out mass atrocities during the war, with as many as 222,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees going missing.CDI: The Center for Defense Information, The Defense Monitor, \\"The World At War: January 1, 1998\\".Democratic Republic of Congo. An long-standing crisis spinning out of control . Amnesty International, 3 September 1998. p. 9. AI Index: AFR 62/33/98 While Kabila, due to his international contacts and ability to speak multiple languages, was clearly the AFDL spokesperson, there was some question about who was the ultimate leader. Andr√© Kisase Ngandu, an elder insurgent with revolutionary credentials, was the president of the AFDL's military wing, the National Resistance Council (CNRD), and apparently expressed opposition to the massacre of Hutu refugees in Congolese camps. This internal tension between the two men was resolved on 4 January 1997, when Ngandu was assassinated in North Kivu by Rwandan Tutsi soldiers, allegedly at the instigation of Kabila and/or Rwandan President Paul Kagame. Kabila thereafter appointed himself president of the CNRD as well as retaining his position as spokesperson and head of the political wing. Once the Kivus were secured, the remainder of the First Congo War consisted for the most part of the AFDL and its allies walking and driving across Zaire to the capital, Kinshasa. The population proved to have a deep antipathy towards Mobutu Sese Seko after decades of corruption and despotism. Most of the demoralized soldiers in the national army either joined the AFDL or deserted. Men from villages and towns throughout Zaire spontaneously joined the AFDL's advance. The AFDL was only slowed down by the country's decrepit infrastructure. In several parts of the country, no paved roads existed; the only links to the outside world were irregularly used dirt paths. On 16 May 1997, after seven months of rebellion and the failure of peace talks, Mobutu fled the country. The AFDL marched into Kinshasa a day later. Kabila declared himself president and renamed the country to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The AFDL then became the new national armed forces.

Baton Rouge doctor Weiss was born in Baton Rouge to Carl Adam Weiss, M.D., and the former Viola Maine. His parents were Jews who converted to Roman Catholicism.Killer Doctors: The Ultimate Betrayal of Trust By Kenneth Gibson Weiss's father was a prominent eye specialist who had once treated Senator Long.http://ajlambert.com/history/hst_hc30.pdf Weiss was educated in local schools and graduated from St. Vincent's Academy. He then obtained his bachelor's degree in 1925 from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. He did postgraduate work in Vienna, Austria, and was thereafter awarded internships in Vienna and at Bellevue Hospital in New York City. In 1932, he returned to Baton Rouge to enter private practice with his father. He was president of the Louisiana Medical Society in 1933 and a member of the Kiwanis International (Conrad 1988, 2:831). The Pavy-Opelousas connection In 1933, Weiss married Yvonne Louise Pavy of Opelousas, the seat of St. Landry Parish. The couple had one son, Carl Austin Weiss Jr., who was born in 1934, shortly before the elder Weiss's death. (Weiss Jr. died 2 August 2019.)https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/article_d1ce27d6-b557-11e9-8f9b-2f8080279968.html Pavy was the daughter of Judge Benjamin Henry Pavy (1874‚Äì1943) and Ida Veazie (died 1941). The Pavy family was part of an anti-Long political faction. Judge Pavy's brother Felix Octave Pavy (1879‚Äì1962), a physician in Leonville and Opelousas, had run for lieutenant governor in 1928 on an intraparty ticket, and had been defeated by Paul N. Cyr, a Jeanerette dentist who was endorsed by Long. Similarly, Judge Pavy, Weiss' father-in-law, was the Sixteenth Judicial District Court state judge from St. Landry and Evangeline parishes. He did not seek reelection in 1936, after Long had the legislature gerrymander the seat to include a majority of pro-Long voters within a revised district.(Conrad 1988, 2:635). Murder of Huey Long On September 8, 1935, Carl Weiss confronted and shot Huey Long in the Capitol building in Baton Rouge. At 9:20 p.m., just after passage of the bill effectively removing Judge Pavy, Weiss approached Long, and, according to the generally accepted version of events, fired a single shot with a handgun from four feet (1.2 m) away. Long was struck in the torso. Long's bodyguards, nicknamed the \\"Cossacks\\" or \\"skullcrushers\\", responded by firing at Weiss with their own pistols, killing him; an autopsy found that Weiss had been shot more than 60 times by Long's bodyguards. Alternate theories and denials of the assassination In the years since the event, theories have arisen that Weiss did not actually murder Senator Long; with some speculating that Long was, in fact, killed by a stray bullet fired from the gun of one of his bodyguards. =Family denials= At the time, Weiss's wife and their families did not accept his guilt. Indeed, Weiss's parents indicated that he had seemed quite happy earlier on the day that Long was killed.T. Harry Williams, Huey Long (1969), p. 868. Many people close to the family, as well as politicians of the time, doubted the official version of the shooting. Weiss's son, Carl Jr., an infant at the time of his father's death, has since vigorously disputed the assertion. In a 1993 interview on the NBC program Unsolved Mysteries,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0737614/plotsummary www.imdb.com he proffered the assertion that Long was accidentally shot by one of his own bodyguards. Donald Pavy, a medical doctor and first cousin of Weiss's wife Yvonne Pavy, conducted a scientific study of the case and concluded in his book Accident and Deception: The Huey Long Shooting that Weiss did not shoot the governor-turned-senator. A Louisiana State University Professor, T. Harry Williams, wrote in his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Long: Portrayal in literature The character of Adam Stanton in Robert Penn Warren's fictitious All the King's Men is partially based on Weiss. In her 1993 memoir, Marguerite Young mentions the murder of Huey Long and how she used to dance with Weiss as a college girl at Louisiana State University.

It was also known as Sender Braunschweig or Sender K√∂nigslutter. The first transmitter was installed in 1962. It transmitted the program of Deutschlandfunk on 755 kHz (756 kHz from 1978 on) at a power of 100 kW and used as its aerial a 137-metre-high guyed steel framework mast. The transmitter power was raised to 200 kW one year later, but it only operated during daytime for some time. Interferences with the Ravensburg mediumwave transmitter which worked on the same frequency were common. A second transmitter was installed for the transmission of the Deutschlandfunk programme on 548 kHz from 28 October 1963, initially with a power of 200 kW. It used a 240-metre-high guyed steel tube mast as its aerial, which was insulated against the ground, A second, insulated guyed steel framework mast was installed to shape the radiation pattern with a minimum towards the southeast, in order to avoid interferences with Radio Mayak in the Soviet Union. On 1 October 1967 the transmission power on 548 kHz was raised to 800 kW (400 kW during nighttime), sufficient to reach all of the northern Federal Republic of Germany and most of the territory of the GDR. According to the Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975 which came into effect in November 1978, transmissions on 548 kHz ceased in favour of Thurnau transmitter which started to transmit at this time on 549 kHz with 200 kW, and Nordkirchen transmitter on the same frequency with 100 kW. Both transmitters at Cremlingen were converted to combined operation at 756 kHz with a maximum daytime power of 800 kilowatts, and 200 kilowatts with a radiation minimum towards the southeast during the night. The height of the steel tube mast was reduced from 240 metres to 199 metres to optimize it for 756 kHz. Likewise, the steel framework mast used to for directional purposes was shortened to 99 m. The height of the 137-metre mast was not changed, it was used after 1978 as a backup aerial. The 800 kW vacuum tube transmitters have been dismantled, and since the middle of the 1990s the transmitter power has been 200 kW all day, provided by two 100 kW transmitters. In 2005, a fully transistorised and DRM capable 800 kW transmitter station was installed. From 2001 to 2003 the program of the pop music radio MEGARADIO was transmitted using the backup station on 630 kHz and the 137-metre-high radio mast as the aerial. This was made possible after this frequency, which had been used from 1978 until the mid-1990s for transmissions of SFB and NDR on 630 kHz from the Dannenberg transmitter in the daytime, had been recoordinated for 24-hour transmission from the Cremlingen transmitter. From 1 April 2005 until 2 January 2013, the program of Voice of Russia was transmitted from Cremlingen on 630 kHz. Switch-off was planned for 31 December 2012, but a technical fault caused transmissions to continue until 2 January 2013.

In Spain, following the Spanish Civil War and the embargo declared by the United Nations against General Francisco Franco's dictatorship, the situation was even worse. The combination of relative underdevelopment, war devastation and an international trade embargo meant that the country operated at a much lower economic level than the rest of Western Europe for nearly two decades and was forced to develop domestic substitutes for hard-to-get imported products and technologies. The Bisc√∫ter, tiny, simple, and cheap even by microcar standards, was a product of this economic environment and was well suited to its time and market. Origins The car had its origins in France in the late 1940s, where aircraft and car designer and manufacturer Gabriel Voisin had designed a minimal car called the Biscooter for Avions Voisin. The playful name implied that it was about the size of two motorscooters, or a scooter with four wheels. The design drew no interest from either manufacturers or consumers there, however, and he eventually licensed it to Spanish firm Autonacional S.A. of Barcelona. By the time it was introduced in 1953, the marque had been hispanicized to Bisc√∫ter. The first car had no formal model name and was called simply the Series 100, but it soon became known as the Zapatilla, or little shoe (clog), after a low- heeled peasant slipper popular at the time. Technical information The Zapatilla was minimal indeed, with no doors or windows or reverse gear. The 1 cylinder, 197 cc, two-stroke motor produced 9 horsepower (7 kW), had a crank starter, and drove only the right front wheel. It had a large, oil-filled cylinder head, to compensate overheating during traffic light arrests, and avoid overcooling while on road at higher speeds, producing a: 'Temperature Buffer' effect. Braking was by an unusual three-point system involving the transmission and cable ties to the two rear wheels. One genuinely advanced feature was an all-aluminum body, although steel was later used. History Biscuter Comercial 200 C from the right side Bisc√∫ter flourished for about ten years and the cars became a common sight on Spanish roads, as well as a part of popular culture. (\\"Ugly as a Bisc√∫ter\\" was a common joke.) Amenities such as doors and windows did eventually appear, and several different bodystyles were produced, including trucks, an elegant woodie station wagon, and a toy- like sports car called the Pegas√≠n (little Pegaso). In 1950 the Spanish auto maker SEAT was set up as the country's national car manufacturer, but at first even the most inexpensive of its designs were considered luxury cars, out of reach of the average Spanish consumer. As time went on and a greater degree of prosperity developed, though, SEATs began to take more of the market and crowd out the cheaper marques. In 1957 the company attempted to produce a sports car, the Biscuter Pegasin in an attempt to attract the wealthier buyers. The styling was similar to the Pegaso Z-102, but it didn't help much. By the early 60s, Bisc√∫ter sales and production stopped, after a total production run of about 12,000. It is thought that almost all of the cars were eventually scrapped. Today Now Bisc√∫ters are mostly museum curiosities, although like many vanished marques they have some following among auto enthusiasts. The name is little-known outside Spain, however, and most materials pertaining to it are in Spanish. Their extreme rarity makes it likely that any surviving example would be a genuine collectible, although probably not one of an extremely high value.

It is now associated with the site of a pool in the current Muslim Quarter of the city, near the gate now called the Lions' Gate or St. Stephen's Gate and the Church of St. Anne, that was excavated in the late 19th century.

Franz Delitzsch (\\"Talmudische Studien, X. Bethesda\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr die gesamte lutherische Theologie und Kirche, 1856) suggested that the name comes from a mishnaic Hebrew loanword from Greek, estiv/estava, that appropriately referred to stoa (œÉœÑŒøŒ¨). Identification of the Biblical site According to the Gospel of John, Bethesda was a bathing pool (, kolumbethra) with five porticoes (translated as porches by older English Bible translations).Peake's commentary on the Bible (1962), on John 5:1‚Äì18. Until the 19th century, there was no clear archaeological evidence for the existence of such a pool, which prompted some Western scholars to argue that the gospel was written later, probably by someone without first-hand knowledge of the city of Jerusalem, and that the pool had only a metaphorical, rather than historical, significance.David Couchman, The Pool of Bethesda in Jerusalem , Focus Pub, 2010 p. 1. The Pool of Bethesda was sometimes identified by commentators with the modern so-called Fountain of the Virgin, in the Kidron Valley, not far from the Pool of Siloam, or alternatively with the Birket Israel, a pool near the mouth of the valley, which runs into the Kidron south of St. Stephen's Gate. Others identified it with the twin pools then called the Souterrains (French for \\"subterranean\\"), under the Convent of the Sisters of Zion; subsequent archaeological investigation has identified these with the later Struthion Pool.Pierre Benoit, The Archaeological Reconstruction of the Antonia Fortress, in Jerusalem Revealed (edited by Yigael Yadin), (1976). However, as early as the fifth century, there was a Byzantine church in what became the precincts of the Church of St. Anne, called the Church of the ProbatikeEirini Panou (2015) in Patristic Studies in the Twenty-First Century: Proceedings of an International Conference to Mark the 50th Anniversary of the International Association of Patristic Studies, Brepolis Publishers, January 2015.

Further archaeological excavation in the area, in 1964, uncovered the remains of the Byzantine and Crusader churches, Hadrian's Temple of Asclepius and Serapis, the small healing pools of an Asclepeion, the second of the two large pools, and the dam between them.An archaeological diagram of the layout ‚Äì the diagram displayed at the location itself ‚Äì is visible at this link . It was discovered that the Byzantine construction was built in the very heart of Hadrian's construction and contained the healing pools.James H. Charlesworth, Jesus and archaeology, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2006. pp. 560‚Äì566. =Gospel account= Robert Bateman (1877) The Johannine text (chapter 5) describes the porticoes as being a place in which large numbers of infirm people were waiting, which corresponds well with the site's apparent use in the 1st century AD as an Asclepeion. The biblical narrative continues by describing a Shabbat visit to the site by Jesus, during which he heals a man who has been bedridden for many years, and could not make his own way into the pool.. The healing, and Jesus' instruction to the man to take up his mat, prompts a protest that the religious customs of the Sabbath have been broken. History =First (northern) pool= The history of the pool began in the 8th century BC, when a dam was built across the short Beth Zeta valley, turning it into a reservoir for rain water;Jerome Murphy-O'Connor, The Holy Land, (2008), page 29Maureen W. Yeung, Faith in Jesus and Paul, page 76Dave Winter, Israel handbook, page 121 a sluice-gate in the dam allowed the height to be controlled, and a rock- cut channel brought a steady stream of water from the reservoir into the city. The reservoir became known as the Upper Pool (◊ë◊®◊ô◊õ◊î ◊î◊¢◊ú◊ô◊ï◊†◊î). =Second (southern) pool= Around 200 BC, during the period in which Simon II was the Jewish High Priest, the channel was enclosed, and a second pool was added on the south side of the dam. Although popular legend argues that this pool was used for washing sheep, this is very unlikely due to the pool's use as a water supply, and its extreme depth (13m). There has been some scholarly debate about whether the pool may have been a mikveh (Jewish ritual bathing pool). =Hellenistic and Roman temples= In the 1st century BC, natural caves to the east of the two pools were turned into small baths, as part of an asclepieion;Andr√© Duprez, Jesus and the god of Healing, as according to John (1970), page 97 however, the Mishnah implies that at least one of these new pools was sacred to Fortuna,Zabim 1:5 the goddess of fortune, rather than Asclepius, the god of healing.Maureen W. Yeung, Faith in Jesus and Paul, page 78 Scholars think it likely that this development was founded by the Roman garrison of the nearby Antonia Fortress, who would also have been able to protect it from attack. Also, the asclepieion's location outside the then city walls would have made its presence tolerable to the Jews, who might otherwise have objected to a non-Jewish religious presence in their holy city. In the mid 1st century AD, Herod Agrippa expanded the city walls, bringing the asclepieion into the city. When Hadrian rebuilt Jerusalem as Aelia Capitolina, he placed a roadway along the dam, and expanded the asclepieion into a large temple to Asclepius and Serapis. =Byzantine church= By the fifth century, at least part of the asclepieion had been converted into, or replaced by, a Byzantine church, known as the Church of the Probatike (literally, the Church of the Sheep, the pool being called the Probatic or Sheep Pool) and initially dedicated to the Healing of the Paralytic, though from the sixth century associated with the Virgin Mary (the pilgrim Theodosios wrote in De Situ Terrae Sanctae (c. 530) that \\"next to the Sheep-pool is the church of my Lady Mary\\"). This reflects a more general movement which appropriated the healing sites of pagan religion and rededicated them to the Virgin Mary. The theory that this church was built by the Empress Eudocia (c. 401‚Äì460) is uncertain. Pools of Bethesda at See the Holy Land It seems more likely to be associated with Juvenal, bishop of Jerusalem in the mid 5th century. This church was destroyed in 614 by the Persians. =Crusader churches= After the Crusader conquest of Jerusalem in 1099, a much smaller church was built among the Byzantine-period ruins on the stone dyke separating the two pools, known as the Church of the Paralytic or the Moustier ('the Monastery'). It was followed by a larger new church erected nearby. This larger church, completed in 1138, was built over the site of a grotto which had (from the fifth or sixth century onwards) been traditionally believed to be the birthplace of Mary, mother of Jesus and was named for Mary's mother, Saint Anne.Yudin, Joe. \\"Off the Beaten Track: The Church of St. Anne\\", Jerusalem Post, 17 November 2011 After the conquest of Jerusalem by Saladin in 1187 it was transformed into a Shafi\`i fiqh (Islamic law school). Gradually the buildings fell into ruin, becoming a midden (waste dump). =Modern times= The pool of Bethesda in 1911 In 1856, the area including the Church of St. Anne and the pool site was presented by the Ottoman Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I to Napoleon III of France. The French renovated and rededicated the church (under the administration of the White Fathers), at the southeast corner of the pools, leaving the other ruins untouched. There is a tale that the site was originally offered to Queen Victoria as part of the negotiations which led ultimately to the Cyprus Convention of 1878.

It stands northwest of the city of Maquoketa. In 1991 on the east side of the park were listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. Description The park contains more caves than any other state park in Iowa. A trail system links the caves, formations, and overlooks while providing a scenic hiking experience. Many areas on these trails have seen new construction, making the journey to the caves safer. Most of the caves may be entered by persons of average physical ability, but some are more advanced. However the park's caves were closed to humans between 2010 and April 2012 in the hopes of protecting the resident bats from white nose syndrome. The park is in the Driftless Area of Iowa. This region escaped being glaciated in the last ice age, while regions to the east and west were not spared. The park has been subjected to hundreds of thousands of years of natural non-glacial erosion. The park's caves, limestone formations and rugged bluffs represent a step back in geological time of thousands of years. Stalactites once hung from the ceilings and stalagmites rose from the floor. Souvenir hunters have robbed the caves of this rare beauty, but many formations remain. The park's limestone caves, arches and chimneys including Dancehall Cave, Hernado's Hideaway, Shinbone Cave, Wye Cave, and an unmarked cave within the Dancehall Cavern locally known as Steelgate Cave. Today a modern interpretive center outside the park entrance provides maps and other informational materials. Inside the park, a central map kiosk includes charts of some of the more interesting caves.  History  Artifacts such as pottery, as well as tools and projectile points made of stone have been found in the caves and surrounding area. These discoveries indicate that the Maquoketa Caves area has been of interest to humans for hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years. Early recorded history tells that the Native Americans in the area were likely visitors to the Raccoon Creek valleys. The first Euro- American explorers first visited the caves as late as the mid-1830s. The area was originally known as Morehead Caves or Burt's Cave. with It had become a popular place for exploration, picnics, parties, and dances by the 1860s. A dance floor was constructed north of Natural Bridge in 1868, and a pavilion, which was used until the 1920s, was built sometime later. By the turn of the 20th century the area had become seriously degraded, and its popularity declined. The first park land was purchased in 1921 by the Maquoketa Women's Club for the purposes of establishing a state park. Originally called Morehead Caves State Park, its name was changed to Maquoketa Caves in 1928. Additional land was acquired in 1931. The majority of the park facilities were constructed from 1932 to 1939 by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Both programs resulted from the federal government effort to make work for Americans during the Great Depression. Their work makes up the contributing properties of the historic district. They include three CCC overlook shelters, the entrance portals, the custodian's residence, the shelterhouse/concession building, the stone picnic circle, and two stone latrines. The noncontributing structures in the park include the CCC/WPA cave improvements, the CCC/WPA trail system, the park ranger's residence, a picnic shelter, and two wood-frame latrines. State Landscape Architect John Fitzsimmons designed the custodian's residence. It and the other historic structures designed by the Central Design Office in Ames, Iowa were built in the Rustic style, which was promulgated by the National Park Service in the 1930s as being appropriate for parks. The State of Iowa purchased an additional on the west side of the park between 1961 and 1981. This section was dedicated as a nature preserve. The park was once featured on an episode of Rescue 911 when a story was done on a hiker who had fallen and was seriously injured while at the park. The hiker was saved by paramedics and the Maquoketa volunteer fire department.

T. arcticus is widespread throughout the Arctic and Pacific drainages in Canada, Alaska, and Siberia, as well as the upper Missouri River drainage in Montana. In the U.S. state of Arizona, an introduced population is found in the Lee Valley and other lakes in the White Mountains. They were also stocked at Toppings Lake by the Teton Range and in various lakes in the high Uinta Mountains in Utah, as well as various alpine lakes of the Boulder Mountain chain in central Idaho. Taxonomy The scientific name of the Arctic grayling is Thymallus arcticus. It was named in 1776 by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas from specimens collected in Russia. The name of the genus Thymallus first given to grayling (T. thymallus) described in the 1758 edition of Systema Naturae by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus originates from the faint smell of the herb thyme, which emanates from the flesh. Description Colville River of Alaska Arctic grayling grow to a maximum recorded length of and a maximum recorded weight of . Of typical thymalline appearance, the Arctic grayling is distinguished from the similar grayling (T. thymallus) by the absence of dorsal and anal spines and by the presence of a larger number of soft rays in these fins. There is a dark midlateral band between the pectoral and pelvic fins, and the flanks may possess a pink iridescence. T. a. arcticus has been recorded as reaching an age of 18 years. Range Native and introduced range of Arctic grayling, Thymallus arcticus in U.S. Arctic grayling are widespread in Arctic Ocean drainages from Hudson Bay, Canada to Alaska and in Arctic and Pacific drainages to central Alberta and British Columbia in Canada. They do not occur naturally in the Fraser and Columbia river basins. There are remnant native populations of fluvial Arctic grayling in the upper Missouri River drainage in the Big Hole River and Red Rock basin (\\"Montana Arctic grayling\\"). Fluvial Arctic grayling have been reestablished in the upper Ruby River, a tributary of the Beaverhead River. The native range formerly extended south into the Great Lakes basin in Michigan. They occur naturally in the Arctic Ocean basin in Siberia from the Ob to Yenisei drainages and in European Russia in some tributaries of Pechora river. Lake dwelling forms of Arctic grayling have been introduced in suitable lake habitats throughout the Rocky Mountains including lakes in the Teton Range in Wyoming and the high Uinta Mountains in Utah),Fishing Wyoming Kenneth Lee Graham Cascade Mountains and Sierra Nevada Mountains as far south as Arizona. Life cycle Several life history forms of Arctic grayling occur: fluvial populations that live and spawn in rivers; lacustrine populations that live and spawn in lakes; and potamodromous populations that live in lakes and spawn in tributary streams. The Arctic grayling occurs primarily in cold waters of mid-sized to large rivers and lakes, returning to rocky streams to breed. The various subspecies are omnivorous. Crustaceans, insects and insect larvae, and fish eggs form the most important food items. Larger specimens of T. arcticus become piscivorous and the immature fish feed on zooplankton and insect larvae. Arctic grayling from the Gulkana River, Paxson, Alaska. Spawning takes place in the spring. Adult fish seek shallow areas of rivers with fine, sand substrate and moderate current. Males are territorial and court females by flashing their colourful dorsal fins; the fins are also used to brace receptive females during the vibratory release of milt and roe. The fish are nonguarders: the eggs are left to mix with the substrate. Although the Arctic grayling does not excavate a nest, the highly energetic courtship and mating tends to kick up fine material which covers the zygotes. The zygote is small (approximately in diameter) and the embryo will hatch after two to three weeks. The newly hatched embryo remains in the substrate until all the yolk has been absorbed. They emerge at a length of around , at which time they form shoals at the river margins. The juveniles grow quickly during their first two years of life. Conservation Arctic grayling are considered a secure species throughout their range. Although some populations at the southern extent of its native range have been extirpated, it remains widespread elsewhere and is not listed on the IUCN Red List of threatened species. The fluvial population in the upper Missouri river basin once merited a high priority for listing under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) by the US Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS). This unique southernmost population is now extirpated from all areas of the basin with the exception of the Big Hole River watershed. In preparation for an ESA listing, the US FWS began implementing a \\"Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances\\" (CCAA). This agreement protects cooperating landowners from being prosecuted under the ESA \\"takings\\" clause so long as they fulfill specific obligations, spelled out in a contractual arrangement and intended to restore the dwindling population. Finally, in 2014 the FWS determined not to list the grayling under ESA, due to the effectiveness of the CCAA. The Arctic grayling is economically important; it is a \\"key subsistence species\\" for the I√±upiat people of the Alaska North Slope, it is raised commercially for food and it is one of the most important species for Sport fishing in Alaska.

It is commonly used in treatment of peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and Zollinger‚ÄìEllison syndrome. Tentative evidence shows it to be of benefit for hives. It can be given by mouth, injection into a muscle, or injection into a vein. Common side effects include headaches and pain or burning if given by injection. Serious side effects may include liver problems, a slow heart rate, pneumonia, and the potential of masking stomach cancer. It is also linked to an increased risk of Clostridium difficile colitis. It is generally safe in pregnancy. Ranitidine is an H2 histamine receptor antagonist that works by blocking histamine, thus decreasing the amount of acid released by cells of the stomach. Ranitidine was discovered in England in 1976, and came into commercial use in 1981. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 48th-most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than sixteen million prescriptions. In September 2019, the carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) was discovered in ranitidine products from a number of manufacturers, resulting in recalls. In April 2020, it was withdrawn from the United States market and suspended in the European Union and Australia due to these concerns. Medical uses *Relief of heartburn *Short-term and maintenance therapy of gastric and duodenal ulcers *With nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce the risk of ulceration Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are more effective for the prevention of NSAID-induced ulcers. *Pathologic gastrointestinal (GI) hypersecretory conditions such as Zollinger‚ÄìEllison syndrome *Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD or GERD) *Erosive esophagitis *Part of a multidrug regimen for H. pylori eradication to minimise the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence *Recurrent postoperative ulcer *Upper GI bleeding *For prevention of acid-aspiration pneumonitis during surgery, it can be administered preoperatively. The drug increases gastric pH, but generally has no effect on gastric volume. In a 2009 meta-analysis comparing the net benefit of PPIs and ranitidine to reduce the risk of aspiration before anaesthesia, ranitidine was found to be more effective than PPIs in reducing the volume of gastric secretions. Ranitidine may have an anti-emetic effect when administered preoperatively. *Prevention of stress-induced ulcers in critically ill patients *Used together with diphenhydramine as secondary treatment for anaphylaxis; after first-line epinephrine. =Dosing= For ulcer treatment, a night-time dose is especially important, as the increase in gastric and duodenal pH promotes healing overnight, when the stomach and duodenum are empty. Conversely, for treating acid reflux, smaller and more frequent doses are more effective. Ranitidine was originally administered long-term for acid- reflux treatment, sometimes indefinitely. For some, though, PPIs have taken over this role. In addition, in children, a fairly rapid tachyphylaxis can develop within six weeks of initiation of treatment, further limiting its potential for long-term use. People with Zollinger‚ÄìEllison syndrome have been given very high doses without any harm. Contraindication Ranitidine is contraindicated for people with acute porphyria in the past, because links may exist between taking ranitidine and acute porphyria. Adverse effects These adverse effects for ranitidine have been reported as events in clinical trials: =Central nervous system= Rare reports have been made of ranitidine causing malaise, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, and vertigo. In severely ill, elderly patients, cases of reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression, and hallucinations have been reported. Ranitidine causes fewer central nervous system adverse reactions and drug interactions compared with cimetidine. =Cardiovascular= Arrhythmias such as tachycardia, bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and premature ventricular beats have also been reported. =Gastrointestinal= All drugs in the H2 receptor blocker class of medicines have the potential to cause vitamin B12 deficiency, secondary to a reduction in food-bound vitamin B12 absorption. Elderly patients taking H2 receptor antagonists are more likely to require B12 supplementation than those not taking such drugs. H2 blockers may also reduce the absorption of drugs (azole antifungals, calcium carbonate) that require an acidic stomach. In addition, multiple studies suggest the use of H2 receptor antagonists such as ranitidine may increase the risk of infectious diarrhoea, including traveller's diarrhoea and salmonellosis. A 2005 study found that by suppressing acid-mediated breakdown of proteins, ranitidine may lead to an elevated risk of developing food or drug allergies, due to undigested proteins then passing into the GI tract, where sensitisation occurs. Patients who take these agents develop higher levels of immunoglobulin E against food, whether they had prior antibodies or not. Even months after discontinuation, an elevated level of IgE in 6% of patients was still found in the study. =Liver= Cholestatic hepatitis, liver failure, hepatitis, and jaundice have been noted, and require immediate discontinuation of the drug. Blood tests can reveal an increase in liver enzymes or eosinophilia, although in rare instances, severe cases of hepatotoxicity may require a liver biopsy. =Lungs= Ranitidine and other histamine H2 receptor antagonists may increase the risk of pneumonia in hospitalised patients. They may also increase the risk of community-acquired pneumonia in adults and children. =Blood= Thrombocytopenia is a rare but known side effect. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia usually takes weeks or months to appear, but may appear within 12 hours of drug intake in a sensitised individual. Typically, the platelet count falls to 80% of normal, and thrombocytopenia may be associated with neutropenia and anemia. =Skin= Rash, including rare cases of erythema multiforme, and rare cases of hair loss and vasculitis have been seen. Precautions =Disease-related concerns= Relief of symptoms due to the use of ranitidine does not exclude the presence of a gastric malignancy. In addition, with kidney or liver impairment, ranitidine must be used with caution. It should be avoided in patients with porphyria, as it may precipitate an attack. =Pregnancy= Ranitidine is rated as pregnancy category B in the United States. =Lactation= Ranitidine enters breast milk, with peak concentrations seen at 5.5 hours after the dose in breast milk. Caution should be exercised when prescribed to nursing women. =Children= In children, the use of gastric acid inhibitors has been associated with an increased risk for development of acute gastroenteritis and community-acquired pneumonia. A cohort analysis including over 11,000 neonates reported an association of H2 blocker use, and an increased incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) neonates. In addition, about a six-fold increase in mortality, necrotizing enterocolitis, and infection such as sepsis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection was reported in patients receiving ranitidine in a cohort analysis of 274 VLBW neonates. =Drug tests= Ranitidine may return a false positive result with some commercial urine drug screening kits for testing for drugs of abuse. =Cancer-causing impurities= In September 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) learned that some ranitidine medicines, including some products sold under the brand name Zantac, contained a nitrosamine impurity called N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), classified as a probable human carcinogen, at low levels. Health Canada (HC) announced that it was assessing NDMA in ranitidine and requested that manufacturers stop the distribution of ranitidine products in Canada until the NDMA levels in the products are found to be safe. Health Canada announced that ranitidine drugs were being recalled by Sandoz Canada, Apotex Inc., Pro Doc Limit√©e, Sanis Health Inc., and Sivem Pharmaceuticals ULC. The European Medicines Agency started a European Union- wide review of ranitidine medicines at the request of the European Commission. In September 2019, Sandoz issued a \\"precautionary distribution stop\\" of all medicines containing ranitidine. followed a few days later by a recall of ranitidine hydrochloride capsules in the United States. The Italian Medicines Agency recalled all ranitidine that uses an active pharmaceutical ingredient from Saraca Laboratories. The Federal Union of German Associations of Pharmacists (Arzneimittelkommission der Deutschen Apotheker ) published a list of recalled products. The Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia published a list of recalled products. In September 2019, Apotex recalled all over-the-counter ranitidine tablets sold in the United States at Walmart, Rite Aid, and Walgreens. Subsequently, Walmart, Rite Aid, Walgreens, and CVS removed Zantac and some generics from their shelves. In October 2019, the U.S. FDA observed that a third-party laboratory was using higher temperatures in its tests to look for nitrosamine impurities. The NDMA was generated by the added heat, but the higher temperatures were recommended for using a gas chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry method to test for NDMA in valsartan and angiotensin II receptor blockers. The FDA stated that it recommends using a liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) testing protocol to test samples of ranitidine. Its LC-HRMS testing method does not use elevated temperatures, and has shown the presence of much lower levels of NDMA in ranitidine medicines than reported by the third-party laboratory. International regulators using similar LC-MS testing methods have also shown the presence of low levels of NDMA in ranitidine samples. The FDA provided additional guidance about using another LC-MS method based on a triple- quadruple MS platform. On 8 October 2019, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency of the United Kingdom issued a drug alert for ranitidine; \\"to proactively communicate the recall to hospitals, pharmacies, dispensing practices, retailers and wholesalers in the UK\\". This included all Zantac branded preparations, along with all generic preparations of ranitidine from Teva UK Limited, Rosemont Pharmaceuticals Limited, Omega Pharma Limited and Galpharm International Limited, Perrigo Company plc, Creo Pharma Limited and Tillomed Laboratories Limited, OTC Concepts Ltd, Relonchem Ltd, Noumed Life Sciences Ltd, and Medreich Plc., Accord Healthcare, Medley Pharma Limited, and Medreich Plc. On the 15 October 2019, the Department of Health and Social Care of the United Kingdom issued a supply distribution alert (SDA/2019/005) for all oral formulations of ranitidine. In October 2019, Sanofi recalled all over-the-counter Zantac in the United States and Canada, Perrigo issued a worldwide recall of ranitidine, Dr. Reddy's issued a recall of all ranitidine products in the United States, and Novitium Pharma recalled all ranitidine hydrochloride capsules in the United States. In November 2019, the FDA stated that their tests have found levels of NDMA in ranitidine and nizatidine that are similar to the levels one would expect to be exposed to if common foods like grilled or smoked meats were cosumed. They also stated that their simulated gastric fluid model tests and their simulated intestinal fluid model tests indicate that NDMA is not formed when exposed to acid in the stomach with a normal diet. The FDA advised companies to recall their ranitidine if testing shows levels of NDMA above the acceptable daily intake (96 nanograms per day or 0.32 parts per million for ranitidine). At the same time, they indicated that some levels of NDMA found in medicines still exceed what the FDA considers acceptable for these medicines. In November 2019, Aurobindo Pharma, Amneal Pharmaceuticals, American Health Packaging, Golden State Medical Supply, and Precision Dose recalled some lots of ranitidine tablets, capsules, and syrup. In December 2019, the FDA asked manufacturers of ranitidine and nizatidine products to expand their testing for NDMA to include all lots of the medication before making them available to consumers. In December 2019, Glenmark Pharmaceutical Inc., USA, recalled some lots of ranitidine tablets. In January 2020, Appco Pharma LLC and Northwind Pharmaceuticals recalled some lots of ranitidine tablets and capsules. In February 2020, American Health Packaging recalled some lots of ranitidine tablets manufactured by Amneal Pharmaceuticals. In April 2020, the FDA requested a manufacturer's market withdrawal of ranitidine. This means ranitidine products will not be available for new or existing prescriptions or over-the-counter use in the U.S. New FDA testing and evaluation prompted by information from third-party laboratories confirmed that NDMA levels increase in ranitidine even under normal storage conditions, and NDMA has been found to increase significantly in samples stored at higher temperatures, including temperatures the product may be exposed to during distribution and handling by consumers. The testing also showed that the longer the time since it was manufactured, the greater the level of NDMA. These conditions may raise the level of NDMA in the ranitidine product above the acceptable daily intake limit. In April 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended the suspension of all ranitidine medicines in the EU due to the presence of low levels of NDMA. Text was copied from this source which is ¬© European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged. Text was copied from this source which is ¬© European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged. Some evidence indicates that NDMA may form from the degradation of ranitidine itself with increasing levels seen over its shelf life. Whether NDMA can also be formed from ranitidine inside the body is unclear. Some studies suggest that it can, while others do not. Given the uncertainties, the committee has recommended a precautionary suspension of these medicines in the EU. In June 2020, one of the companies that markets ranitidine in the European Union requested a re-examination of the CHMP's April 2020 opinion. In August 2020, the EMA provided guidance to marketing authorization holders on how to avoid the presence of nitrosamine impurities in human medicines and asked them to review all chemical and biological human medicines for the possible presence of nitrosamines and to test the products at risk. Text was copied from this source which is ¬© European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged. In September 2020, the FDA issued guidance about the control of nitrosamine impurities in human drugs. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Ranitidine is a competitive, reversible inhibitor of the action of histamine at the histamine H2 receptors found in gastric parietal cells. This results in decreased gastric acid secretion and gastric volume, and reduced hydrogen ion concentration. =Pharmacokinetics= Oral absorption: 50% Protein binding: 15% Metabolism: N-oxide is the principal metabolite. Half- life elimination: With normal renal function, ranitidine taken orally has a half-life of 2.5‚Äì3.0 hours. If taken intravenously, the half-life is generally 2.0‚Äì2.5 hours in a patient with normal creatinine clearance. Excretion: The primary route of excretion is the urine. In addition, about 30% of the orally administered dose is collected in the urine as unabsorbed drug in 24 hours. Elderly In the elderly population, the plasma half-life of ranitidine is prolonged to 3‚Äì4 hours secondary to decreased kidney function causing decreased clearance. Children In general, studies of pediatric patients (aged one month to 16 years) have shown no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameter values in comparison to healthy adults, when correction is made for body weight. History Zantac 300 mg tablets from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Ranitidine was first prepared in England as AH19065 by John Bradshaw in the summer of 1977 in the Ware research laboratories of Allen and Hanburys, part of the larger Glaxo organisation. Its development was a response to the first in class histamine H2 receptor antagonist, cimetidine, developed by Sir James Black at Smith, Kline and French, and launched in the United Kingdom as Tagamet in November 1976. Both companies eventually merged as GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), following a sequence of mergers and acquisitions, starting with the integration of Allen and Hanbury's Ltd and Glaxo to form Glaxo Group Research in 1979, and ultimately with the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham in 2000. Ranitidine was the result of a rational drug- design process using what was by then a fairly refined model of the histamine H2 receptor and quantitative structure-activity relationships. Glaxo refined the model further, by replacing the imidazole ring of cimetidine with a furan ring with a nitrogen-containing substituent, and in doing so developed ranitidine. Ranitidine was found to have a far-improved tolerability profile (i.e. fewer adverse drug reactions), longer-lasting action, and 10 times the activity of cimetidine. Ranitidine has 10% of the affinity that cimetidine has to CYP450, so it causes fewer side effects, but other H2 blockers famotidine and nizatidine have no CYP450 significant interactions. Ranitidine was introduced in 1981, and was the world's biggest-selling prescription drug by 1987. Subsequently, it was largely superseded by the more effective PPI class of drugs, with omeprazole becoming the biggest-selling drug for many years. When omeprazole and ranitidine were compared in a study of 144 people with severe inflammation and erosions or ulcers of the oesophagus, 85% of those treated with omeprazole healed within 8 weeks, compared with 50% of those given ranitidine. In addition, the omeprazole group reported earlier relief of heartburn symptoms.Pelot, Daniel, (M.D.). \\"Digestive System : New Drug for Heartburn\\". The New Book of Knowledge : Medicine & Health, Grolier : Danbury, Connecticut. 1990. p.262. . Library of Congress 82-645223 Preparations Preparations of ranitidine products include oral tablets (75, 150, and 300 mg), effervescent tablets, and syrups, and injectable solutions; with doses of specific ranitidine product preparations are available over-the-counter (OTC) in various countries. In the United Kingdom (UK), only the lowest-strength, 75-mg tablet is available to purchase without a prescription. In Australia, packs containing seven or 14 doses of the 150-mg tablet are available in supermarkets, small packs of 150-mg and 300-mg tablets are schedule 2 pharmacy medicines. Larger doses and pack sizes require a prescription. In the United States, 75- and 150-mg tablets are available OTC. Since 2017, Zantac is marketed in the U.S. by Sanofi.

He spent most of his life as a missionary in China (where he is remembered as \\"Tang Ruowang\\") and became an adviser to the Shunzhi Emperor of the Qing dynasty.  Life  mandarin robes with an Orientialized depiction of the Shunzhi Emperor. Schall von Bell was born to noble parents in Cologne or nearby L√ºftelberg (today part of Meckenheim) in the Holy Roman Empire. After he graduated from the Jesuit Gymnasium in Cologne he moved to Rome and studied subjects such as mathematics and astronomy at the Collegium Germanicum. In 1611 he joined the Society of Jesus and continued his education at the Gregorianum. In 1618 he left for China on a Portuguese ship with a group of missionaries under the lead of Nicolas Trigault. The next year the group reached the Portuguese trading port of Macau where Schall von Bell spent some time learning Chinese. He started missionary work inside China in 1622, but allegedly his success was limited. He participated in the defence of Macau from a Dutch invasion in the same year, and personally took a Dutch captain prisoner from that victorious battle. Schall von Bell and Giacomo Rho were sent to Beijing in 1630 to continue the work of the deceased Johann Schreck on a reform of the Chinese calendar. With Xu Guangqi, he participated in modifying the Chinese calendar and compiling what is known as the Chongzhen calendar. Named after the Chongzhen Emperor, the last emperor of the Ming dynasty (1368 to 1644), the modified calendar provided more accurate predictions of eclipses of the sun and the moon. Upon Xu's passing, he held the requiem in his honor and oversaw the process of shipping the body back to his relatives in Shanghai. After the Ming-Qing Transition in 1644, Schall von Bell gained access to the newly installed Shunzhi Emperor and became one of his trusted counsellors. He was made a mandarin and held an important post in connection with the mathematical school: Director of the Imperial Observatory and the Tribunal of Mathematics. His position enabled him to procure from the emperor permission for the Jesuits to build churches and to preach throughout the country. Thus Schall von Bell is indirectly credited with 500,000 Chinese that are said to have been baptised by Jesuit missionaries within fourteen years, making him a successful missionary. The Shunzhi Emperor died in 1661 and Schall von Bell's position started to erode. In 1664 he was challenged by Yang Guangxian and the Muslim astronomers, who accused him of planning a rebellion and of having wilfully miscalculated time and place of a funeral and in that way contributed to the death of Consort Donggo. Schall von Bell and other Jesuits, Ferdinand Verbiest included, were imprisoned. Schall von Bell had a stroke in prison. At trial, Verbiest spoke in his defense, but all were condemned to death. However, after an earthquake, the Jesuits were pardoned and only five Chinese Christians working in the astronomical office were executed. The Jesuits were exiled to Macau. Schall von Bell died within one year of his release. Yang Guangxian succeeded as the head astronomer at the court. Four years later, however, the young Kangxi Emperor replaced him with Verbiest, and von Bell's honors were fully restored. A collection of Schall von Bell's manuscripts was deposited in the Vatican Library. Dispute Jesuit astronomers with the Kangxi Emperor. In 1758, an allegation, which is disputed by most Jesuits and Catholic historians, was made public. The secretary to Monsignor Charles-Thomas Maillard De Tournon reported that during the final years of his life Schall von Bell lived \\"separated from the other missionaries and removed from obedience to his superiors, in the house given him by the emperor with a woman whom he treated as his wife and who bore him two children.\\" No evidence was provided and the allegations are even contradicted by contemporaneous witnesses and official Chinese documents. It is stated that if true, the story would almost certainly have been reported by others who sought to discredit Schall von Bell and other Jesuits. In addition, the Jesuit structure would most likely have reported the fact to authorities at higher levels of the order. The 1912 Catholic Encyclopedia suggests that the source of the rumor was most likely the adoption by Schall von Bell of the son of a former Chinese servant. Encounter with Prince Sohyeon Crown Prince Sohyeon, first son of King Injo of the Korean Joseon dynasty, was held hostage in Shenyang and later in Beijing. He was highly interested in western sciences and visited Schall von Bell. Schall von Bell gave him books on Western sciences as well as on the Catholic faith that drew the crown prince's interest. Prince Sohyeon suddenly died when he entered Korea in 1645, which dissipated Schall von Bell's hope to extend the Jesuit's missionary work into Korea. Continued cultural relevance in China In 1992, Taiwan issued a commemorative stamp for the 400th anniversary of the birth of Schall von Bell, noting \\"with all his accomplishments his place in Chinese history is secure.\\"Commemorative stamp for Schall's birth In 2013, Chinese CCTV published a documentary on Schall von Bell, as part of its series Biographies. At the very end of the film, the commentator noted that the Chongzhen calendar edited by Schall von Bell is still in use today.Â§ÆËßÜÁΩë‰∫∫Áâ© Ê±§Ëã•Êúõ China International Communication Center's major biographical series of six Westerners in premodern China also featured Schall von Bell.‰ªéË•øÊñπÂà∞‰∏úÊñπ‰πãÊ±§Ëã•Êúõ He is also visible in Chinese soap operas, partly because he was close to Shunzhi Emperor and palace drama is the most popular genre on Chinese TV.

Ingestion of saxitoxin by humans, usually by consumption of shellfish contaminated by toxic algal blooms, is responsible for the illness known as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). The term saxitoxin originates from the genus name of the butter clam (Saxidomus) from which it was first isolated. But the term saxitoxin can also refer to the entire suite of more than 50 structurally related neurotoxins (known collectively as \\"saxitoxins\\") produced by algae and cyanobacteria which includes saxitoxin itself (STX), neosaxitoxin (NSTX), gonyautoxins (GTX) and decarbamoylsaxitoxin (dcSTX). Saxitoxin has a large environmental and economic impact, as its presence in bivalve shellfish such as mussels, clams, oysters and scallops frequently leads to bans on commercial and recreational shellfish harvesting in many temperate coastal waters around the world including northeastern and western United States, western Europe, east Asia, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. In the United States, paralytic shellfish poisoning has occurred in California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and New England. Source in nature Saxitoxin is a neurotoxin naturally produced by certain species of marine dinoflagellates (Alexandrium sp., Gymnodinium sp., Pyrodinium sp.) and freshwater cyanobacteria (Anabaena sp., some Aphanizomenon spp., Cylindrospermopsis sp., Lyngbya sp., Planktothrix sp.) Saxitoxin accumulates particularly in bivalve filter feeders. Saxitoxin has also been found in at least 12 marine puffer fish species in Asia and one freshwater fish tilapia in Brazil. However, the ultimate source of STX is often still uncertain. The dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense is the source of STX found in Florida. Recent research shows the detection of STX in the skin, muscle, viscera, and gonads of ‚ÄúIndian River Lagoon‚Äù southern puffer fish, with the highest concentration (22,104 Œºg STX eq/100 g tissue) measured in the ovaries. Even after a year of captivity, the skin mucus remained highly toxic. The concentrations in puffer fish from the United States are similar to those found in the Philippines, Thailand, Japan, and South American countries. Puffer fish also accumulate a structurally distinct toxin, tetrodotoxin. Structure and synthesis Saxitoxin dihydrochloride is an amorphous hygroscopic solid, but X-ray crystallography of crystalline derivatives enabled the structure of saxitoxin to be determined. Oxidation of saxitoxin generates a highly fluorescent purine derivative which has been utilized to detect its presence. Several total syntheses of saxitoxin have been accomplished. Mechanism of action A diagram of the membrane topology of a voltage gated sodium channel protein. Binding sites for different neurotoxins are indicated by color. Saxitoxin is denoted by red. Saxitoxin is a neurotoxin that acts as a selective, reversible, voltage-gated sodium channel blocker. One of the most potent known natural toxins, it acts on the voltage-gated sodium channels of neurons, preventing normal cellular function and leading to paralysis. The voltage-gated sodium channel is essential for normal neuronal functioning. It exists as integral membrane proteins interspersed along the axon of a neuron and possessing four domains that span the cell membrane. Opening of the voltage-gated sodium channel occurs when there is a change in voltage or some ligand binds in the right way. It is of foremost importance for these sodium channels to function properly, as they are essential for the propagation of an action potential. Without this ability, the nerve cell becomes unable to transmit signals and the region of the body that it enervates is cut off from the nervous system. This may lead to paralysis of the affected region, as in the case of saxitoxin. Saxitoxin binds reversibly to the sodium channel. It binds directly in the pore of the channel protein, occluding the opening, and preventing the flow of sodium ions through the membrane. This leads to the nervous shutdown explained above.  Biosynthesis  Although the biosynthesis of saxitoxin seems complex, organisms from two different kingdoms, indeed two different domains, species of marine dinoflagellates and freshwater cyanobacteria, are capable of producing these toxins. While the prevailing theory of production in dinoflagellates was through symbiotic mutualism with cyanobacteria, evidence has emerged suggesting that dinoflagellates, themselves, also possess the genes required for saxitoxin synthesis. Saxitoxin biosynthesis is the first non-terpene alkaloid pathway described for bacteria, though the exact mechanism of saxitoxin biosynthesis is still essentially a theoretical model. The precise mechanism of how substrates bind to enzymes is still unknown, and genes involved in the biosynthesis of saxitoxin are either putative or have only recently been identified. Two biosyntheses have been proposed in the past. Earlier versions differ from a more recent proposal by Kellmann, et al. based on both biosynthetic considerations as well as genetic evidence not available at the time of the first proposal. The more recent model describes a STX gene cluster (sxt) used to obtain a more favorable reaction. The most recent reaction sequence of Sxt in cyanobacteria is as follows. Refer to the diagram for a detailed biosynthesis and intermediate structures. alt= The proposed biosynthetic pathway of saxitoxin in cyanobacteria # It begins with the loading of the acyl carrier protein (ACP) with acetate from acetyl-CoA, yielding intermediate 1. # This is followed by SxtA-catalyzed methylation of acetyl-ACP, which is then converted to propionyl-ACP, yielding intermediate 2. # Later, another SxtA performs a Claisen condensation reaction between propionyl-ACP and arginine producing intermediate 4 and intermediate 3. # SxtG transfers an amidino group from an arginine to the Œ±-amino group of intermediate 4 producing intermediate 5. # Intermediate 5 then undergoes retroaldol-like condensation by SxtBC, producing intermediate 6. # SxtD adds a double bond between C-1 and C-5 of intermediate 6, which gives rise to the 1,2-H shift between C-5 and C-6 in intermediate 7. # SxtS performs an epoxidation of the double bond yielding intermediate 8, and then an opening of the epoxide to an aldehyde, forming intermediate 9. # SxtU reduces the terminal aldehyde group of the STX intermediate 9, thus forming intermediate 10. # SxtIJK catalyzes the transfer of a carbamoyl group to the free hydroxyl group on intermediate 10, forming intermediate 11. # SxtH and SxtT, in conjunction with SxtV and the SxtW gene cluster, perform a similar function which is the consecutive hydroxylation of C-12, thus producing saxitoxin and terminating the STX biosynthetic pathway.  Illness and poisoning  =Toxicology= Saxitoxin is highly toxic to guinea pigs, fatal at only 5 Œºg/kg when injected intramuscularly. The lethal doses (LD50) for mice are very similar with varying administration routes: i.v. is 3.4 Œºg/kg, i.p. is 10 Œºg/kg and p.o. is 263 Œºg/kg. The oral LD50 for humans is 5.7 Œºg/kg, therefore approximately 0.57 mg of saxitoxin (1/8th of a medium-sized grain of sand) is lethal if ingested and the lethal dose by injection is about 1/10th of that (approximately 0.6 Œºg/kg). The human inhalation toxicity of aerosolized saxitoxin is estimated to be 5 mg¬∑min/m¬≥. Saxitoxin can enter the body via open wounds and a lethal dose of 50 Œºg/person by this route has been suggested. =Illness in humans= The human illness associated with ingestion of harmful levels of saxitoxin is known as paralytic shellfish poisoning, or PSP, and saxitoxin and its derivatives are often referred to as \\"PSP toxins\\". The medical and environmental importance of saxitoxin derives from the consumption of contaminated shellfish and certain finfish which can concentrate the toxin from dinoflagellates or cyanobacteria. The blocking of neuronal sodium channels which occurs in PSP produces a flaccid paralysis that leaves its victim calm and conscious through the progression of symptoms. Death often occurs from respiratory failure. PSP toxins have been implicated in various marine animal mortalities involving trophic transfer of the toxin from its algal source up the food chain to higher predators. Studies in animals have shown that the lethal effects of saxitoxin can be reversed with 4-aminopyridine, but there are no studies on human subjects. As with any paralytic agent, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation or artificial ventilation of any means will keep a poisoned victim alive until antidote is administered or the poison wears off.  Military interest  Saxitoxin, by virtue of its extremely low LD50, readily lends itself to weaponization. In the past, it was considered for military use by the United States and was developed as a chemical weapon by the US military. It is known that saxitoxin was developed for both overt military use as well as for covert purposes by the CIA. Among weapons stockpiles were M1 munitions that contained either saxitoxin or botulinum toxin or a mixture of both. On the other hand, the CIA is known to have issued a small dose of saxitoxin to U-2 spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers in the form of a small injection hidden within a silver dollar, for use in the event of his capture and detainment. After the 1969 ban on biological warfare by President Nixon, the US stockpiles of saxitoxin were destroyed, and development of saxitoxin as a military weapon ceased. However, in 1975 the CIA reported to Congress that it had kept a small amount of saxitoxin and cobra venom against Nixon‚Äôs orders which was then destroyed or distributed to researchers. It is listed in schedule 1 of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The United States military isolated saxitoxin and assigned it the chemical weapon designation TZ.

Gerrit Anne (Gerry) Blaauw (July 17, 1924 ‚Äì March 21, 2018) was a Dutch computer scientist, known as one of the principal designers of the IBM System/360 line of computers, together with Fred Brooks, Gene Amdahl, and others.\\"Gerrit Blaauw\\" in Unsung Heroes in Dutch Computing History, a website created for the IEEE Computer Society's Web Programming Competition (CHC61), 2007  Biography  Born in The Hague, Netherlands, Blaauw received his BA from the Delft University of Technology in 1946. In 1947, Blaauw won an exclusive scholarship funded by IBM Chief Executive Officer Thomas J. Watson. After an initial year at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania, Blaauw studied at Harvard University. He received his MA in 1949 and his PhD in 1952 under supervision of Howard Aiken, inventor of the early Mark I computer. At Harvard, he worked on design of the Mark III and Mark IV computers. Blaauw met Fred Brooks while he was working for IBM and visited Harvard, where Fred Brooks was then a graduate student. After graduation in 1952, Blaauw returned to the Netherlands where he worked at the Mathematical Centre on the second ARRA computer. In 1955 he returned to the United States to work at IBM's Poughkeepsie labs where he worked with Brooks on a number of projects: * He was a designer on the IBM 7030 STRETCH project. * He worked on the ill-fated IBM 8000 series, and in particular designed a paging system for the IBM 8106 in the 1960-1961 period.Pugh, op. cit., p. 740 note 197 * He was a key engineer on the IBM System/360 project, announced in 1964. Among other contributions, Blaauw made the successful case for an 8-bit (as opposed to 6-bit) computer architecture. Blaauw also designed a revolutionary address translation system, the \\"Blaauw Box\\", which was removed from the original System/360 design, but was later used in IBM's unsuccessful proposal to MIT's Project MAC.The IBM 360/67 and CP/CMS, Tom Van Vleck, 1995, 1997, 2005, 2009 Subsequently, Dynamic Address Translation (DAT) hardware of a somewhat different design was incorporated in the important IBM System/360-67 computer.\\"Program and Addressing Structure in a Time-Sharing Environment\\", B.

After leaving IBM, Blaauw became a computer science professor in the Netherlands. He retired in 1989 as professor emeritus with Universiteit Twente. In 1982 he was elected member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1997 he co-authored Computer Architecture: Concepts and Evolution with Brooks.Computer Architecture: Concepts and Evolution, Gerrit A. Blaauw and Frederick P.

The film is an adaptation of the 1974 American film The Longest Yard, featuring association football rather than American football. It also reunites most of the cast from executive producer Guy Ritchie's prior blockbusters Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. Plot Danny \\"The Mean Machine\\" Meehan (Vinnie Jones) is a retired footballer and former captain of England, who was banned from football for life for fixing an unspecified match they played against Germany. In the present day, after a long drinking session, he drives recklessly to a local bar, where he is chased by police. Inside the bar, when asked to take a breathalyser test, he assaults two police officers and is arrested; he is later convicted and sentenced to three years in Longmarsh prison. Once inside, his status as a celebrity immediately runs him foul of the guards, and he is unfairly beaten by the prison guards soon after arrival for \\"misbehaving\\". After being shown around the prison, Meehan is told to visit the prison governor's office, who tells Danny that he pulled strings to make sure he served his sentence in Longmarsh, wanting him to work as the head coach of the prison wardens' football team. Not wanting to make enemies with the other inmates, Meehan declines, and instead suggests the guards allow him to train a team made up of other convicts, who will take on the wardens in a practice match to gear them up for the new season. Shortly after, Meehan is met with an unwelcome reception his cellmates, Raj, Jerome and Trojan, who immediately express their dislike for him. Outside, Danny meets and befriends an elderly convict, Doc, who teaches him prison lore. While cleaning the yards with Doc, Meehan is introduced to Sykes, a gangster and one of the most respected inmates in the prison. Sykes also shows resentment towards Meehan, revealing he lost a large amount of money betting on the England game he had fixed. Later in the prison cafeteria, Meehan makes another ally, meeting the prison's friendly contraband dealer \\"Massive\\". Massive tells a somewhat apprehensive Danny he could get him anything he wanted smuggled into the prison, and offers himself as his right hand man. The next day, Meehan is sent to solitary confinement after getting into a fight in the cafeteria. While Danny is locked in his cell, Massive, proving his skills as a contraband dealer, gifts him a packet of mints through his cell door. After his release back into general population, Danny and Massive begin the recruitment process for his team, but struggle, as many of the inmates are apprehensive to join due to both Sykes' influence over the prison and their disdain for Meehan as a cheat. As Danny tries and fails to form a team, Massive is playing football in a prison hallway, when a racist guard approaches him and attacks him as the other inmates watch in anger. Meehan charges at the guard and saves Massive from further beating, earning the respect of many of the other inmates for doing so. This leads to him being sent to solitary again. Massive, thankful for Danny's help, this time gifts him a tennis ball to pass the time with. When Danny is released from solitary again, he is greeted by Raj and Trojan who have recruited a team of players and is occupied with the task of training up his team of cons, including a dangerous maximum-security inmate named \\"The Monk\\". Meanwhile, the warden gets himself into trouble with \\"Barry the Bookie,\\" an unlicensed bookmaker who was recommended to him by Sykes. After being threatened on the phone by Barry, the warden decides to try to make back the money he owes by betting on the prison guards' team. As Danny begins to earn the trust and respect of his fellow inmates and they continue to improve as a football team, a shifty inmate named Nitro accuses him of being a snitch, which leads to two other inmates and associates of Sykes attacking Danny in the showers. As they threaten to cut his eyes out, they are caught by the guards who ask what happened, but Meehan refuses to tell, which earns him the respect of both Sykes' men and Sykes himself. The next day, Sykes and his associates offer to help the team, under the condition that Danny beats one of them in a fight. The fight takes place later that night, and Danny wins by knocking out Sykes' henchman. Sykes and his associates join, and Sykes tells Danny all is forgiven if his team wins, which would allow Sykes to make back the money he lost on the England match. Frustrated that his plan to have Danny taken out didn't work, Nitro, a bomb expert, offers to take Meehan out in exchange for a transfer to a lower security prison which one of the guards, Mr. Ratchett agrees to. Nitro crafts a bomb in his cell and places it in Danny's locker while he's not around. With almost all of the inmates on board and the game approaching, Danny and the rest of the team are going over tactics in one of the cells, when he realises he has left a tape containing footage of the guards playing last year in his locker. Doc offers to go and get it, and as he leaves, Jerome asks Danny why he fixed the England match. Danny reveals he was heavily in debt at the time, and was blackmailed into fixing the game with the promise of enough money to pay off his debt if he threw the game, or the threat of being crippled for life if he didn't. As Danny is telling the other inmates, Doc arrives at the cell and is killed by the bomb. Nitro is subsequently sent to another facility, but not to the minimum-security prison he was promised ‚Äì he is sent to a mental facility where Ratchett tells him he will be heavily sedated all the time. The match commences shortly after Doc's death. Before the game begins, Sykes gives the team one last gift from Doc - custom football kits with the name \\"Mean Machine\\" printed on all of them. At half time, the inmates' team is winning 1‚Äì0, and things are going well until the governor, fearing what will happen if he loses a second bet, attempts to blackmail Meehan, accusing him of accessory to Doc's murder and threatening to sentence him to 20 years unless he throws the match. At first he puts his own interests before that of the team's, deliberately playing poorly and faking injury to be taken off the pitch. As the final moments of the game tick down, he redeems himself, bravely using a square-ball to fellow inmate 'Billy the Limpet' to win the game for the cons. Afterward, the Captain of the Guards, Mr. Burton, refuses to co-operate with the governor's attempts to get revenge on Danny, instead congratulating him on the win. The governor's vehicle explodes, and Sykes informs him that he, and Barry the Bookie, will retaliate if he tries anything. A victorious Danny and Massive walk triumphantly across the pitch.

In addition, Nevin Saroya (prisoners' team) was once a Brentford youth team player, and Perry Digweed (guard's team), played as a goalkeeper primarily for Brighton & Hove Albion, although in the film, he is a defender. Ryan Giggs, then an active player with Manchester United and the Wales national football team, appears briefly (at minute 77:00) as a warden. Production Producer Matthew Vaughan, while looking for a film vehicle to highlight ex-soccer star Vinnie Jones, came across director Robert Aldrich's 1974 American football comedy The Longest Yard. Jones, who was known for rough play and off-field rowdiness, seemed a natural for the lead role. Mean Machine was filmed from April to June 2001. Most of the prison scenes were filmed at HM Prison Oxford,Vinniejones.co.uk and the match was filmed at The Warren, the former home ground of Yeading.Telegraph.co.uk The Warren is located in Hayes. Release and reception Mean Machine was released in United Kingdom theaters on 28 December 2001 and according to the box office database website Box Office Mojo, grossed $2,288,365 during its opening weekend with a total domestic gross of $6,288,153 (as of 27 January 2002). The film was released in the United States on 22 February 2002 with total gross receipts in the amount of $92,770. Total foreign gross (excluding the United States) was $929,283 (as of 23 February 2003). Reception of the film was mixed to negative, according to Rotten Tomatoes, which gave the film a 34% score.Mean Machine ‚Äì Movie Reviews ‚Äì Rotten Tomatoes Aggregate website Metacritic gave the film a Metascore of 45, indicating average or mixed reviews, and a user score of 7.7 indicating positive audience response. A major criticism of the film was that it was unintentionally funny and led to \\"prison cliches\\".Kansascity.com Jamie Russell of the BBC wrote, \\"[I]t keeps its tongue welded firmly in its cheek. The scriptwriters have enough sense to replay every funny moment from the original, while also adding a couple of innovations of their own. The final soccer game is definitely the high point of the proceedings, if only because it lets the star do what he does best - play some very dirty football.\\" While A.O. Scott of the New York Times wrote, \\"Reviewing The Longest Yard in The New York Times 28 years ago, Nora Sayre objected to its clumsiness and violence, but admitted to being entertained by the football sequences. Watching this remake, I had the opposite response: the story was moderately engaging and moved swiftly, but the long soccer match at the end bored me silly. Perhaps this is just American chauvinism, or perhaps that kind of football is inherently less cinematic than ours. It's certainly no less brutal.\\" References External links  Category:2001 films Category:2000s crime comedy-drama films Category:2000s prison films Category:2000s sports comedy-drama films Category:British association football films Category:British crime comedy-drama films Category:British films Category:British prison films Category:British remakes of American films Category:British sports comedy-drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films produced by Matthew Vaughn Category:Films scored by John Murphy (composer) Category:Films shot in London Category:Films shot in Oxfordshire Category:Prison comedy films Category:Prison drama films ","title":"Mean Machine (film)"},{"id":"1267022","text":"Lisinopril is a medication of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor class used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and after heart attacks. For high blood pressure it is usually a first line treatment. It is also used to prevent kidney problems in people with diabetes mellitus. Lisinopril is taken by mouth. Full effect may take up to four weeks to occur. Common side effects include headache, dizziness, feeling tired, cough, nausea, and rash. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure, liver problems, high blood potassium, and angioedema. Use is not recommended during the entire duration of pregnancy as it may harm the baby. Lisinopril works by inhibiting the renin‚Äìangiotensin‚Äìaldosterone system. Lisinopril was patented in 1978, and approved for medical use in the United States in 1987. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 104 million prescriptions. In July 2016, an oral solution formulation of lisinopril was approved for use in the United States.  Medical uses  Lisinopril is typically used for the treatment of high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and diabetic nephropathy. A review concluded that lisinopril was effective for treatment of proteinuric kidney disease, including diabetic proteinuria. In people of sub-Saharan African descent, calcium-channel blockers or thiazide diuretics are more effective than lisinopril for lowering blood pressure, although there is not convincing evidence that these drugs differ in their effect on morbidity or mortality in such persons. = Kidney problems = The dose must be adjusted in those with poor kidney function. Dose adjustments may be required when creatinine clearance is less than or equal to 30mL/min. Since lisinopril is removed by dialysis, dosing changes must also be considered for people on dialysis. = Pregnancy and breastfeeding = Animal and human data have revealed evidence of lethal harm to the embryo and teratogenicity associated with ACE inhibitors. No controlled data in human pregnancy are available. Birth defects have been associated with use of lisinopril in any trimester. However, there have been reports of death and increased toxicity to the fetus and newly born child with the use of lisinopril in the second and third trimesters. The label states, \\"When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Zestril as soon as possible.\\" The manufacturer recommends mothers should not breastfeed while taking this medication because of the current lack of safety data.  Contraindications  Lisinopril is contraindicated in people who have a history of angioedema (hereditary or idiopathic) or who have diabetes and are taking aliskiren.  Adverse effects  The incidence of adverse effects varies according to which disease state the patient is being treated for. People taking lisinopril for the treatment of hypertension may experience the following side effects: * Headache (3.8%) * Dizziness (3.5%) * Cough (2.5%) Persons with the ACE I/D genetic polymorphism may be at higher risk for ACE inhibitor-associated cough. * Difficulty swallowing or breathing (signs of angioedema), allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) * Hyperkalemia (2.2% in adult clinical trials) * Fatigue (1% or more) * Diarrhea (1% or more) * Some severe skin reactions have been reported rarely, including toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome; causal relationship has not been established. People taking lisinopril for the treatment of myocardial infarction may experience the following side effects: * Hypotension (5.3%) * Kidney dysfunction (1.3%) People taking lisinopril for the treatment of heart failure may experience the following side effects: * Hypotension (3.8%) * Dizziness (12% at low dose ‚Äì 19% at high dose) * Chest pain (2.1%) * Fainting (5‚Äì7%) * Hyperkalemia (3.5% at low dose ‚Äì 6.4% at high dose) * Difficulty swallowing or breathing (signs of angioedema), allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) * Fatigue (1% or more) * Diarrhea (1% or more) * Some severe skin reactions have been reported rarely, including toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome; a causal relationship has not been established. Lisinopril 40-mg oral tablet  Overdose  In one reported overdose, the half-life of lisinopril was prolonged to 14.9 hours. The case report of the event estimates that the individual consumed between 420 and 500 mg of lisinopril and survived. In cases of overdosage, it can be removed from circulation by dialysis.  Interactions  ;Dental care ACE-inhibitors like lisinopril are considered to be generally safe for people undergoing routine dental care, though the use of lisinopril prior to dental surgery is more controversial, with some dentists recommending discontinuation the morning of the procedure. People may present to dental care suspicious of an infected tooth, but the swelling around the mouth may be due to lisinopril-induced angioedema, prompting emergency, and medical referral.  Pharmacology  Lisinopril is the lysine-analog of enalapril. Unlike other ACE inhibitors, it is not a prodrug, is not metabolized by the liver, and is excreted unchanged in the urine. = Mechanism of action = Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor, meaning it blocks the actions of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the renin‚Äìangiotensin‚Äìaldosterone system (RAAS), preventing angiotensin I from being converted to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent direct vasoconstrictor and a stimulator of aldosterone release. Reduction in the amount of angiotensin II results in relaxation of the arterioles. Reduction in the amount of angiotensin II also reduces the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, which allows the kidney to excrete sodium along with water into the urine, and increases retention of potassium ions. Specifically, this process occurs in the peritubular capillaries of the kidneys in response to a change in Starling forces. The inhibition of the RAAS system causes an overall decrease in blood pressure. = Pharmacokinetics = Absorption Lisinopril has a poor bioavailability of ~25% (reduced to 16% in people with New York Heart Association Functional Classification (NYHA) Class II‚ÄìIV heart failure). Its time to peak concentration is 7 hours. The peak effect of lisinopril is about 4 to 8 hours after administration. Food does not affect its absorption. Distribution Lisinopril does not bind to proteins in the blood. It does not distribute as well in people with NYHA Class II‚ÄìIV heart failure. Metabolism Lisinopril is the only water-soluble member of the ACE inhibitor class, with no metabolism by the liver. Elimination Lisinopril leaves the body completely unchanged in the urine. The half-life of lisinopril is 12 hours, and is increased in people with kidney problems. While the plasma half-life of lisinopril has been estimated between 12‚Äì13 hours, the elimination half-life is much longer, at around 30 hours. The full duration of action is between 24 and 30 hours. = Chemistry = Pure lisinopril powder is white to off white in color. Lisinopril is soluble in water (approximately 13 mg/L at room temperature), less soluble in methanol, and virtually insoluble in ethanol.  History  Captopril, the first ACE inhibitor, is a functional and structural analog of a peptide derived from the venom of the jararaca, a Brazilian pit viper (Bothrops jararaca). Enalapril is a derivative, designed by scientists at Merck to overcome the rash and bad taste caused by captopril.Jenny Bryan for The Pharmaceutical Journal, 17 Apr 2009 \\"From snake venom to ACE inhibitor ‚Äì the discovery and rise of captopril\\"Jie Jack Li, \\"History of Drug Discovery\\". Chapter 1 in Drug Discovery: Practices, Processes, and Perspectives. Eds. Jie Jack Li, E. J. Corey. John Wiley & Sons, 2013 Enalapril is actually a prodrug; the active metabolite is enalaprilat.Menard J and Patchett A. \\"Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors\\". pp. 14‚Äì76 in Drug Discovery and Design. Volume 56 of Advances in Protein Chemistry. Eds. Richards FM, Eisenberg DS, and Kim PS. Series Ed. Scolnick EM. Academic Press, 2001. . pp. 30‚Äì33 Lisinopril is a synthetic peptide derivative of captopril. Scientists at Merck created lisinopril by systematically altering each structural unit of enalaprilat, substituting various amino acids. Adding lysine at one end of the drug turned out to have strong activity and had adequate bioavailability when given orally; analogs of that compound resulted in lisinopril, which takes its name from the discovery with lysine. Merck conducted clinical trials, and the drug was approved for hypertension in 1987 and congestive heart failure in 1993. The discovery posed a problem, since sales of enalapril were strong for Merck, and the company did not want to diminish those sales. Merck ended up entering into an agreement with Zeneca under which Zeneca received the right to co-market lisinopril, and Merck received the exclusive rights to an earlier stage aldose reductase inhibitor drug candidate, a potential treatment for diabetes. Zeneca's marketing and brand name, \\"Zestril\\", turned out to be stronger than Merck's effort.David R. Glover. Vie D'or: Memoirs of a Pharmaceutical Physician. Troubador Publishing Ltd, 2016. . Merck Sharp and Dohme: lisinopril section The drug became a blockbuster for Astrazeneca (formed in 1998), with annual sales in 1999 of $1.2B. The US patents expired in 2002.Express Scripts. Patent expirations Since then, lisinopril has been available under many brand names worldwide; some formulations include the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide.

He was one of the men of \\"the Modern Break-through\\". Biography Schandorph was born on 8 May 1836 in Ringsted, the son of Johan Frederik Schandorph (1790‚Äì1855) and Andrea Kirstine M√∏ller (1804‚Äì73). In 1855 he entered the University of Copenhagen. In 1862 he published his first volume of poetry, written in the romantic style and giving little indication of the ultimate direction that his talent was to take. Other books followed, but his gifts first found full expression in a volume of rustic tales entitled Fra Provinsen (1876), in which he described provincial character and life with much frankness of detail and a great deal of wit. In 1878 his novel, Uden Midtpunkt (\\"Without a Centre\\"), recast later in dramatic form, attracted great attention by its exposure of contemporary failings. Among the more famous of his later novels are: *Thomas Friis' Historie (2 vols, 1881) *Det gamle Apothek (\\"The Old Apothecary\\"[?]) (1855) *Poet og Junker (1892) *Helga (1900) But his most characteristic work is to be found in his various volumes of short sketches. He published his own Recollections (Oplevelser) in 1889. He died after a long illness at Frederiksberg on New Year's Day 1901. Today Schandorph is little read and not regarded a very outstanding man of the ‚Äùbreak-through‚Äù but he is however an important key figure as an inspiration of Henrik Pontoppidan and later regionalist and social writers.

Their self-titled debut album was released on 22 June 2018. History The band's formation was first announced in December 2017. Stolt recalled that the German-based independent record label Inside Out Music first suggested the idea of establishing a new band with strong songwriters. By the time of their announcement, their debut album was nearing completion. The group had gathered in north London to record at Livingston Studios which marked the first time the five had been in the same room together. Stolt realised such a risk would affect the music, but the experience turned into a successful and productive one after almost two hours of music was developed collectively and recorded. Stolt said their direction includes elements of progressive and art rock combined with pop and cinematic music. The album is scheduled for release on Inside Out Records on 22 June 2018, which will be supported by their debut live gig at the Night of the Prog XIII festival in Lorelei, Germany, on 14 July 2018.

The performances are parodies of both professional wrestling and the tokusatsu kaiju eiga films of Japan. These Battels are presented in the style of professional wrestling events, with the costumed performers playing the roles of giant, city-crushing monsters similar to Godzilla and Gamera. The misspelling of \\"Battel\\" originates in a mistake Borden made on a T-shirt design, which became an inside joke. The performances include many in-jokes aimed towards fans of professional wrestling (especially Mexican wrestling), superhero comic books and Japanese popular culture. Many of the names of the characters are in mock Spanish or mock Japanese, and Engrish is used liberally for comedic effect. History of Studio Kaiju Big Battel sticker on Houston in New York City Kaiju Big Battel began as a video project by Rand Borden when he was a student at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The first character created was Midori no Kaiju (Japanese for \\"Big Green Monster\\"), which Borden assembled from upholstery foam coated with latex. While the video project never came to fruition, another student suggested that more characters be created to fight Midori no Kaiju at live competitions, or, Big Battels. The first Battel occurred on Halloween night in 1996 at the Revolving Museum in Boston and featured Midori No Kaiju, as well as Atomic Cannon, Powa Ranjuru, Force Trooper Robo, Taro \\"The Mouth\\" Fuji's commentary, and Anthony Salbino's construction. The first full-scale Kaiju Big Battel event was held in March 1997 in Boston, Massachusetts at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. The earliest performances in other cities included matches with other troupes of costumed wrestlers at venues such as Fort Thunder in Providence, Rhode Island. Borden has created more than 120 monster costumes, which he keeps in storage. Borden formed Studio Kaiju hiring his brother, David, as manager in 2000. Kaiju Big Battel: Terebi Sento was the studio's first DVD release, showcasing four matches from 2001 and several bonus features. Kaiju Big Battel: A Practical Guide to Giant City-Crushing Monsters, a comedic history of the first 8 years of Kaiju Big Battel, was published in 2004 by Hyperion Press. Action Blast! was an American animated television children's television series program block shown on the American cable and satellite channel, G4 in the 8am ET hour. Hosted by the characters \\"Louden Noxious\\" and \\"The Beav\\" from Kaiju Big Battel, the block aired for just under a year from January 2, 2006 until December 29 of the same year. The program had no input from G4 outside of complying with Comcast's standards and practices; instead the entire hour was programmed and produced by toymaker Hasbro, with the company buying paid programming time from G4, and none of the network's logo, bugs, or promotions were seen on the program except for one promo ad on the half-hour. An Action Blast! bug was formerly seen on the bottom left-hand corner but later replaced with another alternate name for the block, MonkeyBarTV (a play on the title of the popular podcast Tiki Bar TV, which was targeted towards an adult audience).

The campaign failed to meet its stated goal of $20,000. A second Kickstarter for Kaiju Big Battel figurines was launched in August 2018 and successfully raised $21,396. Kaiju Big Battel: Fighto Fantasy On October 31st 2018 a Kaiju Big Battel video game was released on PC and mobile platforms. The game was developed by Super Walrus Games and is a satire of Final Fantasy style RPGs from the '90s. Political themes Story lines for events are inspired by the American political atmosphere at the time. During the time when Obamacare was being legislated, the character of American Beetle switched from a Republican to a Democrat because he needed insurance for surgery. Quotes from American President Donald Trump are sometimes used in speeches made by the main villain, Dr. Cube.

Biography =Early years= Scharf was born at 3 St Martin's Lane, London, the son of George Johann Scharf, a Bavarian miniature painter, and older brother to Henry Scharf, actor and illustrator. He was educated at University College school, and after studying under his father and obtaining medals from the Society of Arts, entered the schools of the Royal Academy in 1838. =Travels = In 1840 Charles Fellows engaged Scharf to join him on his second journey to Asia Minor and on the way spent some time in Italy. Three years later he again visited Asia Minor in the capacity of draughtsman. He made drawings of views and antiquities from Lycia, Caria, and Lydia, which are now in British Museum. A selection of these illustrations with text by Fellows was published in 1847. =Career= After his return to England, Scharf exhibited his paintings of the tombs in Myra and Xanthos at the Royal Academy in 1845 and 1846.The Royal Academy of Arts; a complete dictionary of contributors and their work from its foundation in 1769 to 1904 (1905), p 42. https://archive.org/details/royalacademyofar07grav He also illustrated books relating to art and antiquity, of which the best known are Macaulay's Lays of Ancient Rome (1847); Milman's Horace, (1849); Kugler's Handbook of Italian Painting (1851); and Dr Smith's classical dictionaries. He also engaged largely in lecturing and teaching, and took part in the formation of the Greek, Roman and Pompeian courts at the Crystal Palace. He acted as art secretary to the great Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857, and in that year was appointed secretary and director to the newly founded National Portrait Gallery. The remainder of his life was given to the care of that institution. Scharf acquired an unrivalled knowledge of all matters relating to historic portraiture, and was the author of many learned essays on the subject. In 1885, in recognition of his services to the Portrait Gallery, he was made CB, and on his resignation, early in 1895, KCB and a trustee of the Gallery.

Also used to prevent cardiovascular disease in those at high risk. It is a reasonable initial treatment for high blood pressure. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headaches, dizziness, feeling tired, and cough. Serious side effects may include liver problems, angioedema, kidney problems, and high blood potassium. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended. It is an ACE inhibitor and works by decreasing renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system activity. Ramipril was patented in 1981 and approved for medical use in 1989. It is available as a generic medication. A month supply in the United Kingdom costs the NHS less than ¬£1 as of 2019. In the United States, the wholesale cost of this amount is about US$2. In 2017, it was the 134th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than five million prescriptions. Medical uses Medical uses include: *High blood pressure *Congestive heart failure *Following heart attack in people with evidence of heart failure *People over 55 years at high risk: prevention of heart attack, stroke, cardiovascular death, or need of revascularization procedures *Kidney damage due to diabetes with protein in the urine (In low doses it is used as a prophylaxis for developing nephropathy and related secondary cardiovascular events.) Contraindications Contraindications to its use include renovascular disease (impaired blood flow in the kidneys), severe kidney impairment (especially in patients with one kidney or with bilateral renal artery stenosis), volume-depleted patients, a history of angioedema while on an ACE inhibitors, pregnancy and hypotension. People should not take ramipril (or any ACE inhibitors) if they have hyperkalemia. It is also recommended to avoid using salt-substitutes as this can further increase potassium levels in the blood. Adverse effects *Shakiness *Dry cough *Dizziness and light-headedness due to low blood pressure *Fatigue, especially in the early stages *Mouth dryness in the early stages *Nausea *Fainting *Signs of infection (e.g., fever, chills, persistent sore throat) *Chest pain *Neutropenia (low white blood cells) *Impotence (erectile dysfunction) *Hyperkalemia Serious allergic reactions to this drug are unlikely, but immediate medical attention must be sought if they occur. Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction include, but are not limited to a rash or swelling of the face, mouth, tongue, or throat. In extreme cases, ramipril may lead to potentially fatal liver problems. Mechanism of action Ramipril 1.25-mg oral capsule, letter codes and icons may differ ACE inhibitors inhibit the actions of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), thereby lowering the production of angiotensin II and decreasing the breakdown of bradykinin. The decrease in angiotensin II results in relaxation of arteriole smooth muscle leading to a decrease in total peripheral resistance, reducing blood pressure as the blood is pumped through widened vessels. Its effect on bradykinin is responsible for the dry cough side effect. Ramipril, a prodrug or precursor drug, is converted to the active metabolite ramiprilat by carboxylesterase 1. Ramiprilat is mostly excreted by the kidneys. Its half-life is variable (3‚Äì16 hours), and is prolonged by heart and liver failure, as well as kidney failure.

Biography Leopold Schefer was educated, privately, by his parents, later on by the principal of the Muskau primary school, Andreas Tamm, afterwards in a small private school of the former hofmeister of the local Earl of Callenberg, Johann Justus R√∂hde. From 1799 up to 1805 he attended the secondary school (‚ÄúGymnasium‚Äù) at Bautzen. During this time he started writing diaries, poems, and compositions, the last under the influence of his teacher Johann Samuel Petri. After that he returned to Muskau, helping his widowed mother, while writing and composing. During Napoleon's failed campaign in Russia in 1812, Schefer was appointed manager of the big estates of his newly- won friend, Prince Hermann von P√ºckler-Muskau, doing well under hard circumstances until 1816. The prince, recognizing the literary abilities of his friend, encouraged his early poetical efforts. Having visited England together with P√ºckler for studying landscape gardens (and being deeply impressed by Eliza O'Neill on the stage), Schefer studied composition under Antonio Salieri in Vienna from 1816‚Äì17, and travelled to Italy, Greece, Egypt, Palestine, and Turkey. Schefer returned in 1819 to Muskau, where he remained for all his life, married, fathering one son and four daughters, due to his literary success in easy - after the lost German revolution 1848/49 in poor - circumstances, following his literary pursuits until his death in 1862.See Bettina and Lars Clausen: Zu allem f√§hig, 2 vols., Bangert & Metzler, Frankfurt on Main 1985. Works thumb Schefer wrote a large number of novels, short novels, and narratives which appeared mostly in literary almanacs. Some of his novels have been published in English, as e.g. K√ºnstlerehe (1828, with deep insights into married life).Bettina Clausen: Leopold Schefer Bibliographie. Frankfurt am Main 1985 Schefer was well known for his novels and their observative power, but even more for a single volume of poems, Laienbrevier (1834‚Äì1835). These, owing to their warmth of feeling, keen psychology, and descriptions of the beauties of nature, at once established his fame as a poet. This vein he followed in later years with the poems Vigilien (1843), Der Weltpriester (1846), and Hausreden (1869). Encouraged by his friend, the poet Max Waldau (1822‚Äì1855), he published Hafis in Hellas (Hamburg, 1853) and Koran der Liebe (Hamburg, 1855) containing with their glowing descriptions of the East love poetry of a realistic and high order. But, due to his pantheistic beliefs, his poetry and novels were barred from the curricula of the Prussian elementary and secondary schools, which resulted in his being forgotten after 1910. On the occasion of Schefer's 222nd birthday on July 30, 2006, a whole day was devoted to several of Bad Muskau's events as part of the Lusatian Music Summer, above all to his compositional oeuvre.

It is located in Linz, the capital of Upper Austria. It offers bachelor's, master's, diploma and doctoral degrees in business, engineering, law, science, social sciences and medicine. Today, 19,930Ordentliche Studierende an √∂ffentlichen Universit√§ten 2017/18 nach Universit√§t students study at the park campus in the northeast of Linz, with one out of nine students being from abroad. The university was the first in Austria to introduce an electronic student ID in 1998. The university is the home of the Johann Radon Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematics (RICAM) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. In 2012, the Times Higher Education ranked the JKU at # 41 and in 2015 at # 87 in its list of the top 100 universities under 50 years old. According to the 2012 ranking, the JKU was the fifth best young university in German-speaking Europe. The university attained high scores for quotations, third-party funding, and internationalization efforts.  History  The JKU was established as the \\"College of Social Sciences, Economics and Business\\" (Hochschule f√ºr Sozial- und Wirtschaftswissenschaften) in 1966. The Faculty of Sciences and Engineering was established three years later and in 1975, the college was awarded university status and the Faculty of Law was integrated on campus. The university was named in honor of astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) who wrote his magnum opus harmonices mundi (\\"The Harmony of the world\\") in Linz during the early 17th century and taught mathematics at a school for the landed gentry (Adelichen Landt-Schuelen) near Linz. At present, the campus added the \\"JKU Science Park\\", additional buildings for science and engineering institutes. In 2019 many new buildings are being built.  Campus  JKU's campus is located in the northeast of Linz, in the Auhof area of the St. Magdalena district. The university buildings are placed in a 90-acre (364,000 m¬≤) park centered around a pond. = Infrastructure = The campus is accessible by the Linz tram lines 1 and 2 and the express bus line 77. On weekdays, trams travel every 5 minutes and a trip to the city center (Hauptplatz) takes approximately 16 minutes. The JKU is also located close to Austria's autobahn network at theDornach exit on the A7 M√ºhlkreisautobahn (ca. 1 km or 0.6 miles). In anticipation of extending the campus, an additional autobahn exit, Auhof, is currently in the construction stages and is expected to better facilitate traffic, allowing a more direct route to the university. A bicycle path in the north-east corner of the town located along the north side of the Danube river provides direct access to the university and helps to reduce traffic in the area. = Housing = Many larger dormitories are within walking distance of the university, such as the Julius Raab Heim, the WIST Haus, the Kepler Heim, the ESH and the KHG Heim. Several other dormitories are located in different parts of Linz, providing housing for more than 3,100 students in all of Linz. Some of the dormitories become hotels during the summer holidays, most notably the Julius Raab Heim under the name Hotel Sommerhaus.  Organization  = Management = The university Rector and Academic Senate are responsible for the university's management. There are several vice rectors who are each assigned to specific task areas and who assist the Rector. The university board is an independent body that advises and counsels the Rector and Academic Senate on management issues. Deans and faculty committees are responsible for management on a faculty level. Rector and deans are elected for a 4-year period whereas faculty committees are elected for a 2-year period. = Faculties and Degree Programs= The Johannes Kepler University has four faculties with a total of 127 institutes.  Faculty of Social Sciences, Economics and Business (SoWi)  The Faculty of Social Sciences, Economics and Business is the oldest and largest faculty in terms of students and graduates. The faculty consists of 32 institutes and offers academic degrees e.g. in Economics and Business Administration, Business Informatics, Business and Education, Social Economics, Sociology and Statistics. The faculty's abbreviation SoWi is derived from the German name of the faculty, Sozial- und Wirtschaftswissenschaftliche Fakult√§t.  Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences (TN)  The Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences was established in 1969 and initially offered degrees e.g. in Technical Mathematics, Computer Science and Technical Physics. Over time, degrees in Technical Chemistry, Mechatronics and Information Electronics were introduced. Several master's degrees to specialize in the area of computer science, mathematics and physics, such as pervasive computing, industrial mathematics or biophysics are available. Doctorate degrees are offered in the areas of natural science and technical science. The TN faculty consists of 51 distinctive institutes and the German name is Technisch-Naturwissenschaftliche Fakult√§t, hence the abbreviation TN or TNF.  Faculty of Law (RE)  The Faculty of Law was officially established in 1975. Before that time period, law degrees were offered by the SoWi faculty, which was then theFaculty of Social Sciences, Economics, Business and Law. In addition to Diploma and doctorate degrees in law, the RE faculty offers a Bachelor's degree in Business Law in cooperation with the SoWi faculty. Law degrees are also offered via multimedia distance learning. The abbreviation RE is derived from the first two letters of the faculty's name German name, Rechtswissenschaftliche Fakult√§t. At present, the RE faculty consists of 20 institutes.  Faculty of Medicine (MED)  The Faculty of Medicine was founded in 2014. A new MED-Campus is being built.  Interdisciplinary programs  The master's degree program in web sciences is divided into branches of study: social web, web art & design, web business & economy, web engineering as well as web and the law. It offers those with academic background in various fields a research-led expansion and in-depth look at fields relevant to the web such as technology, business, law, society, art and culture.  Distance learning  The JKU maintains several distance learning centers in Austria that offer degrees and courses at the German FernUniversit√§t Hagen, the British Open University and JKU's own distance law degree program.  Other universities in Linz  There are three other universities in Linz: The University of Art and Design Linz, a public university for arts and industrial design (ca. 800 students), the Anton Bruckner Private University with approx. 1000 students enrolled, and the Catholic Private University Linz with about 500 students, which has been a Papal faculty since 1978.

It covers the legendary life of Saint Nicholas, Bishop of Myra, Lycia, in a dramatic sequence of events. The composer wrote the work for the centenary of Lancing College in Sussex, with the resources of the institution in mind. It is scored for mixed choir, tenor soloist, four boys singers, strings, piano duet, organ and percussion. The only professionals required are the tenor soloist, a string quintet to lead the other strings, and the percussionists. Saint Nicolas is Britten's first work for amateur musicians. The premiere was the opening concert of the first Aldeburgh Festival in June 1948, with Peter Pears as the soloist.  History  Benjamin Britten wrote the cantata Saint Nicolas, Op. 42, from December 1947 to May 1948 for the centennial celebrations of Lancing College in Sussex. Writing specifically for the resources available to him on this occasion, Britten scored the piece for mixed choir, tenor soloist, four boys, strings, piano duet, organ and percussion. Within this ensemble, the only professional musicians required were the tenor soloist, a string quintet to lead the other strings, and the percussionists. Saint Nicolas marks Britten's first professional work intended primarily for performance by amateur musicians. Now the cantata is frequently performed by youth and amateur ensembles. The duration is given as 50 minutes. While the piece was written for Lancing College, the first performance was actually, with the College's permission, the opening concert of the first Aldeburgh Festival on 5 June 1948, when it was performed in Aldeburgh Church. Britten's dedication reads: \\"This Cantata was written for performance at the centenary celebrations of Lancing College, Sussex, on 24 July 1948\\". The text of Saint Nicolas was written by Eric Crozier after extensive research into the legendary life of Saint Nicholas, Bishop of Myra, Lycia. Crozier's libretto paints a dramatically bold portrait of the saint's character, exaggerating the legends and glory that have accumulated over the centuries around Nicholas's story. Britten's music enhances the drama of Crozier's text using striking contrasts in instrumentation, vocal style, and musical textures. The Thames Television production, with Ian Partridge singing the title role, won the 1977 Prix Italia.Debrett's  Overview  = I. Introduction = Saint Nicolas opens with an introduction in which the mixed choir, representing a contemporary people, calls to Nicolas to speak to them across the ages. They sing, ‚ÄúOur eyes are blinded by the holiness you bear,‚Äù and they wish to hear the true story of Nicolas, the man. After being implored to ‚ÄúStrip off [his] glory,‚Äù Nicolas responds in a flourish, speaking to the choir, ‚ÄúAcross the tremendous bridge of sixteen hundred years‚Ä¶‚Äù The first movement ends with a choral prayer. The choral introduction is centred on the pitch class E, prominent as a pedal tone for much of the first movement. Harmonic tension is achieved by brief chromatic meanderings that return to the central pitch; this technique is effective by providing harmonic and melodic interest while remaining accessible to young and/or amateur singers. Nicolas‚Äô response to the chorus departs from the emphasis on E, travelling through many different keys, though generally using diatonic melodies. Nicolas ends his solo on pitch class A, which becomes the new pedal tone for the choral prayer. = II. The Birth of Nicolas = The second movement begins the depiction of Nicolas‚Äô life, recounting the story of his miraculous birth, when ‚Äú‚Ä¶from his mother's womb he sprang and cried, 'GOD BE GLORIFIED!‚Äô‚Äù Stories of his childhood continue, punctuated by the refrain ‚ÄúGOD BE GLORIFIED!‚Äù, sung by the boy Nicolas (portrayed by the 'youngest boy in the choir', as specified by the composer.) At the end of the movement, the boy becomes a man, and the movement closes with the full-voiced adult tenor singing the refrain. This movement consists of a tune written in the A-Lydian mode. Britten modulated between A-Lydian and E-Lydian for alternating verses; he did so by altering the Lydian modes into whole-tone-collections, raising the fourth scale degree (as is customary for Lydian) but also raising the fifth scale degree to travel from one mode to the other. The harmonies supporting the modal melodies are tonal and fairly straightforward. At the moment that Nicolas becomes a man, Britten colours the melody's supporting harmonies in a much more dissonant manner, using a semitone clash to darken the simple refrain. = III. Nicolas Devotes Himself to God = The third movement is sung by Nicolas alone, who recounts how ‚ÄúMy parents died ‚Ä¶ All too soon I left the tranquil beauty of their home ‚Ä¶ and knew the wider world of men.‚Äù Nicolas then bemoans his distress over man's faults and devotes himself to a life of service to God. Britten orchestrated the second movement for just strings and tenors; the texture is much less complicated than the preceding movements. The third movement lacks a tonal center and meanders through significantly more dissonant harmonies; the absence of a catchy, recognisable tune (found in most other movements) makes the third movement come across as a recitative. = IV. He Journeys to Palestine = The fourth movement of the cantata depicts a sea voyage bringing Nicolas to Palestine. During this voyage, a mighty storm assails the ship, perhaps as punishment to the faithless sailors who have mocked the pious saint. The storm is terrifying, and the sailors despair. Amidst the violent winds, waves, and rain, Nicolas gathers the sailors in prayer, and the storm subsides. The movement opens with an energetic modal melody centred on F; the melody alternates between the Aeolian, or natural minor mode, and Dorian, with its raised sixth. Britten even raises the fourth occasionally, hinting at Lydian. The interplay between modes in this melody contributes to its lilting character. The tune becomes more dissonant as the storm approaches, and when the storm arrives, the men's song is halted. The female chorus, singing from the galleries, represents the winds and tempests; the girls‚Äô voices describe the terrifying storm, pausing only for the sailors‚Äô cries for mercy. As the storm subsides, Nicolas emerges; his prayer is musically and textually simple. The movement ends with a return of the initial tune, this time in F major with very slight alteration. = V. Nicolas Comes to Myra and is Chosen Bishop = In the fifth movement, Nicolas is appointed Bishop of Myra. The chorus calls upon him to ‚ÄúServe the faith and spurn its enemies.‚Äù Nicolas vows to do just that, and the movement closes with a congregational hymn. This movement is the most traditionally tonal of the entire cantata; D major is strongly established in the chorus‚Äô homophonic texture. Halfway through the movement, Britten employs a diatonic fugato that concludes in G major. In this key, the congregation joins in the singing of the hymn known as Old Hundredth, which misses out verses 2 and 5 and begins with the words \\"All people that on earth do dwell\\" The semichorus sings an upliftingly beautiful descant in Verse 2, rising up to a top B on the word it in \\"For it is seemly so to do\\". = VI. Nicolas from Prison = Like the third movement, the sixth recalls an operatic recitative. Here Nicolas admonishes mankind for accepting its wilderness, calling them to turn to God. While the strings and piano accompaniment are generally centred on a D minor chord, the vocal melody is highly chromatic and dissonant. = VII. Nicolas and the Pickled Boys = The seventh movement of Saint Nicolas depicts the legend of the Pickled Boys. Nicolas finds himself in an inn where a group of travellers have paused for the night. They invite the bishop to dine with them, but Nicolas stops them from eating, realising that the meat that they eat is in fact the flesh of three boys murdered and pickled by the butcher. Nicolas calls to the boys, \\"Timothy, Mark, and John, put your fleshly garments on!‚Äù and the boys come back to life, singing ‚ÄúAlleluia!\\" Like the second and fourth movements, the seventh employs a diatonic mode (here it is B-Aeolian) and a memorable tune sung by the chorus. The female chorus, again singing from the galleries, employ Phrygian and Aeolian modes as they sing the roles of mothers seeking their missing sons. When Nicolas enters the scene, he begins with a melody based on F#-Mixolydian, with occasional chromatic alterations. He ends his call to the dead boys in A major, and the movement concludes with a triumphant repeat of the opening motif in B major. = VIII. His Piety and Marvellous Works = This movement is a choral song of praise to Nicolas, briefly recounting several different stories of his mercy, charity, and kindness. Most of this movement is written homophonically, with a brief canonic section towards the end. This movement is strongly tonal, in G major. = IX. The Death of Nicolas = In the final movement of the cantata, Nicolas speaks to his impending death with joy, eagerness, and acceptance. He sings, \\"Lord, I come to life, to final birth ...\\" using a highly chromatic melody characteristic of the tenor's solo section. Simultaneously, the chorus chants the Nunc dimittis using the Gregorian \\"fourth tone\\" (on which the music of the orchestral introduction is also based). They conclude the chant as Nicolas concludes with the text, \\"I bless Thy name, who lived and died for me, and dying, dying, dying, dying, yield my soul to Thee.\\" After an energetic instrumental interlude (again based on the plainchant), the cantata closes with a congregational hymn praising God's mysteries and the courage of the saints. The hymn tune of \\"God Moves in a Mysterious Way\\" is known as the London New.  References   Sources  * Bridcut, John. Britten's Children. London: Faber and Faber, 2006. * Carpenter, Humphrey.

Heinrich Julian Schmidt (March 7, 1818 ‚Äì March 27, 1886) was a German journalist and historian of literature. Biography He was born in Marienwerder (today Kwidzyn) in West Prussia. After studying history and philosophy at the University of K√∂nigsberg, he was appointed in 1842 to a mastership in the Luisenstadt Realschule in Leipzig. From 1848 to 1861, he owned and edited Die Grenzboten conjointly with Gustav Freytag. In 1861, he moved to Berlin where he was editor-in-chief of the Berliner allgemeine Zeitung, and after that dedicated himself to literary history. In 1878 was rewarded for the journalistic services rendered to the government, by a pension from the emperor William I. He died at Berlin on March 27, 1886. Julian Schmidt's principal contributions to literary history are: *Geschichte der Romantik im Zeitalter der Revolution und Restauration (History of Romanticism during the times of Revolution and Restoration; 1848) *Geschichte der deutschen Nationalliteratur im 19. Jahrhundert (History of German national literature in the 19th century; 1853) His numerous critical articles for Die Grenzboten formed the basis for this. The 5th ed., revised and enlarged, appeared under the title Geschichte der deutschen Litteratur seit Lessings Tod (History of German literature since Lessing's death; 1865‚Äì67). *Geschichte des geistigen Lebens in Deutschland von Leibniz bis auf Lessings Tod (History of Germany's intellectual life from Leibniz until Lessing's death; 1861‚Äì1863) The latter two works subsequently appeared as Geschichte der deutschen Literatur von Leibniz bis auf unsere Zeit (History of German literature from Leibniz until modern times; 4 vols., 1886‚Äì1896). Schmidt also wrote a Geschichte der franz√∂sischen Literatur seit der Revolution (History of French literature since the Revolution; 1857), Uebersicht der englischen Litteratur im 19. Jahrhundert (Outline of English literature of the 19th century; 1859); Schiller und seine Zeitgenossen (Schiller and his contemporaries; 1859); the collections of essays Bilder aus dem geistigen Leben unserer Zeit (Snapshots from the intellectual life of our time; 1870‚Äì74), and Portr√§ts aus dem 19. Jahrhundert (Portraits from the nineteenth century; 1878) An evaluation from the New International Encyclop√¶dia  Julian Schmidt exercised more influence upon the period of German intellectual life in which he worked than has been accorded him. As a critic in journals and periodicals, his discussions comprised the entire scope of intellectual life in science, arts, and politics. The forte of his criticism, especially in regard to works of art, lay in an almost infallible instinct to perceive truth, power, and sterling worth, which quality enabled him to teach his contemporaries not to borrow their views of things from remote chains of thought, but to trust the spontaneity of their own feelings.

Advanced organic chemistry reactions, mechanisms and structure (3rd ed.). New York: John Wiley & Sons, inc. The reaction always involves at least two steps, and possibly a third. :Free-radical substitution general description In the first step called initiation (2,3) a free radical is created by homolysis. Homolysis can be brought about by heat or ultraviolet light but also by radical initiators such as organic peroxides or azo compounds. UV Light is used to create two free radicals from one diatomic species. The final step is called termination (6,7) in which the radical recombines with another radical species. If the reaction is not terminated, but instead the radical group(s) go on to react further, the steps where new radicals are formed and then react is collectively known as propagation (4,5) because a new radical is created available for secondary reactions.  Radical substitution reactions  In free radical halogenation reactions radical substitution takes place with halogen reagents and alkane substrates. Another important class of radical substitutions involve aryl radicals. One example is the hydroxylation of benzene by Fenton's reagent. Many oxidation and reduction reactions in organic chemistry have free radical intermediates, for example the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids with chromic acid. Coupling reactions can also be considered radical substitutions. Certain aromatic substitutions takes place by radical-nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Auto- oxidation is a process responsible for deterioration of paints and food and lab hazards such as diethyl ether peroxide. More radical substitutions are listed below: * The Barton‚ÄìMcCombie deoxygenation is a way to substitute a hydroxyl group for a proton. * The Wohl‚ÄìZiegler reaction involves the allylic bromination of alkenes. * The Hunsdiecker reaction converts silver salts of carboxylic acids to alkyl halides. * The Dowd‚ÄìBeckwith reaction involves ring expansion of cyclic Œ≤-keto esters. * The Barton reaction involves synthesis of nitrosoalcohols from nitrites. * The Minisci reaction involves generation of an alkyl radical from a carboxylic acid and a silver salt and subsequent substitution at an aromatic compound References Category:Free radical reactions Category:Reaction mechanisms ","title":"Radical substitution"},{"id":"1267116","text":"The 1950 Atlantic hurricane season was the first year in the Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT) that storms were given names in the Atlantic basin. Names were taken from the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet, with the first named storm being designated \\"Able\\", the second \\"Baker\\", and so on. It was an active season with sixteen tropical storms, with eleven of them developing into hurricanes. Six of these hurricanes were intense enough to be classified as major hurricanes‚Äîa denomination reserved for storms that attained sustained winds equivalent to a Category 3 or greater on the present- day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale. One storm, the twelfth of the season, was unnamed and was originally excluded from the yearly summary, and three additional storms were discovered in re-analysis. The large quantity of strong storms during the year yielded, prior to modern reanalysis, what was the highest seasonal accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) of the 20th century in the Atlantic basin; 1950 held the seasonal ACE record until broken by the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. However, later examination by researchers determined that several storms in the 1950 season were weaker than thought, leading to a lower ACE than assessed originally. This season also set the record for the most tropical storms, eight, in the month of October. The tropical cyclones of the season produced a total of 88 fatalities and $38.5 million in property damage (1950 USD). The first officially named Atlantic hurricane was Hurricane Able, which formed on August 12, brushed the North Carolina coastline, and later moved across Atlantic Canada. The strongest hurricane of the season, Hurricane Dog, reached the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale and caused extensive damage to the Leeward Islands. Two major hurricanes affected Florida: Easy produced the highest 24-hour rainfall total recorded in the United States, while King struck downtown Miami as a Category 4 hurricane and caused $27.75 million (1950 USD) of damage. The two major landfalls made the 1945‚Äì1950 period the only five-year period to feature five major hurricane landfalls in the United States‚Äîa record that held until tied in 2000‚Äì2005. The last storm of the year, an unnamed tropical storm, dissipated on November 13\\\\.

This season was the first time that the United States Weather Bureau operated with radar technology to observe hurricanes away from land. Although the season began on June 15, tropical activity typically does not begin before August. The tropics remained tranquil through early August, and the U.S. Weather Bureau noted that the season had been \\"remarkably quiet\\". The inactive period ended on August 12, when the first tropical storm developed east of the Lesser Antilles. This storm received the name \\"Able\\" as part of the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet. (The same alphabet was also used in the 1951 and 1952 seasons, before being replaced by female naming in 1953.) Before the end of August, four hurricanes had formed in the Atlantic, two of which attained major hurricane status. A major hurricane is a tropical cyclone with winds of at least ; a storm of this intensity would be classified as a Category 3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale introduced in the 1970s. In contrast to the busy August, only three named storms developed in September‚Äîalthough three of the August hurricanes lasted into September. Hurricane Dog became the strongest hurricane of the season on September 6 with winds of ; its peak strength occurred over the open Atlantic Ocean, so it did not cause significant damage when it was at its strongest. It was among the most severe hurricanes on record in Antigua, where the hurricane struck early in its duration. Eight tropical storms or hurricanes formed in October, which is greater than in any other year. In total, there were sixteen tropical storms during the season, of which five (Tropical Storm How, Tropical Storm Mike and three unnamed tropical storms) did not attain hurricane status. Overall, six major hurricanes occurred during the year. The Hurricane Hunters made about 300 flights into hurricanes during the season, the most since the practice began in 1943. The number of storms was above average; in a typical year, eleven tropical storms, six hurricanes, and between two and three major hurricanes take place. With the numerous major hurricanes, the season produced a high accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) of 211, although it was originally assessed as 243 before reanalysis. At one point, the 1950 total was the highest on record, before being surpassed by the 2005 season. This value is an approximation of the combined kinetic energy used by all tropical cyclones throughout the season. Systems =Hurricane Able= The beginning of the hurricane season was inactive, with the formation of no tropical cyclones during June or July. The first storm of the year originated from a tropical wave that exited the west coast of Africa around August 5\\\\. Its status over the next few days were unknown due to sparse observations. On August 12, the system was designated Tropical Storm Able east of the Lesser Antilles, which strengthened to hurricane status on August 14\\\\. Able gradually intensified as it tracked generally west-northwestward, and by 12:00 UTC on August 17, Able became a major hurricane. Initially, Able was thought to pose a threat to the Bahamas and Florida. Instead, the hurricane turned to the northwest, reaching its peak intensity as a strong Category 3 hurricane, with winds of . The storm later turned to the northeast, passing just offshore Cape Hatteras, North Carolina and Cape Cod. Steadily weakening and accelerating, Able struck Nova Scotia as a minimal hurricane, and later struck Newfoundland as an extratropical storm. It dissipated early on August 24 in the far northern Atlantic Ocean. Along the coast of North Carolina, the hurricane produced light winds and rough waves, as well as moderate precipitation. Heavier rainfall occurred in southern New England, causing flooding in portions of New York City and producing slick roads that caused nine traffic fatalities. Able produced hurricane-force winds in Nova Scotia, and damage across Canada totaled over $1 million (1950 CAD, $ USD) in the agriculture, communications, and fishing industries. Two people died in Canada when their raft was overturned. =Hurricane Baker= A tropical wave exited western Africa on August 13, which developed into Tropical Storm Baker east of the Lesser Antilles on August 18\\\\. It moved northwestward and later turned to the west, attaining hurricane status on August 21\\\\. The next day, the hurricane attained Category 2 intensity just as it crossed over Antigua, where heavy damage was reported. More than 100 homes were damaged or destroyed, which left thousands homeless. Afterward, the hurricane began to weaken, and later on August 22 its winds decreased to tropical storm status. The cyclone then struck Montserrat as a strong tropical storm. The next day it struck southwestern Puerto Rico, and shortly thereafter weakened into a tropical depression, passing over the Dominican Republic. Baker turned more to the west, re-attaining tropical storm status before striking eastern Cuba on August 24. In Cuba, 37 people died, and the property losses reached several million dollars. On August 25, Baker weakened to tropical depression status while crossing Cuba, but soon thereafter regained tropical storm intensity in the western Caribbean Sea. Two days later, Baker entered the Gulf of Mexico, and by the next day Baker had regained hurricane status. It turned northward, reaching a peak intensity of on August 30\\\\. Baker weakened slightly before making landfall near Gulf Shores, Alabama with winds of on August 31. Property and crop damage totaled $2.55 million (1950 USD), primarily between Mobile, Alabama and Saint Marks, Florida. Torrential rainfall fell throughout the region, with the largest total occurring in Caryville, Florida, where of precipitation were recorded. The heavy precipitation was responsible for extensive crop damage across the region. The hurricane also spawned two tornadoes, one of which destroyed four houses and a building in Apalachicola, Florida. In Birmingham, Alabama, high wind downed power lines, which caused one death and two injuries due to live wires. While inland, Baker tracked northwestward and eventually dissipated over southeastern Missouri on September 1. =Hurricane Charlie= Hurricane Charlie developed on August 21 to the southwest of the Cape Verde islands. At the time, the Weather Bureau did not consider Charlie to be a tropical cyclone until almost a week later. For four days, the storm tracked generally to the west as a weak tropical storm. On August 25, it turned to the northwest and intensified, becoming a hurricane on August 28\\\\. On August 30, Charlie attained peak winds of , although the Hurricane Hunters estimated higher winds. At the time, the hurricane was stalled to the east-southeast of Bermuda, and subsequently turned to a westward drift. On September 2, Charlie turned to the north and northeast. At the time, it co-existed with two other hurricanes, Dog and Easy; it is a rare occurrence for three hurricanes to exist simultaneously in the Atlantic. Charlie slowly weakened and lost tropical characteristics, and by September 5 Charlie had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. It dissipated later on September 5 without having affected land. =Hurricane Dog= Hurricane Dog is believed to have developed from a tropical wave that left the coast of Africa on August 24\\\\. Its first observation as a tropical cyclone occurred on August 30, when it was a hurricane; the storm is believed to have begun farther east as a Cape Verde-type hurricane, but was not detectable before August 30. At the time, Dog was located east of the Lesser Antilles, and it quickly attained major hurricane status as it moved to the west- northwest. Dog passed through the Lesser Antilles with winds of . It was considered among the worst hurricanes in the history of Antigua, where thousands were left homeless. Damage was estimated at $1 million (1950 USD, $ USD), and there were two deaths from drowning in the region. After passing through the Leeward Islands, the hurricane turned to a northerly drift with continued intensification. On September 5, it attained wind speeds that would be equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane on the present-day Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained winds of . Operationally, the wind intensity value was estimated by Hurricane Hunters at when the hurricane was located about south- southwest of Bermuda; this estimate is now believed to have been an overestimation of the peak winds in Hurricane Dog, though the storm produced enormous wave heights at sea. Maintaining peak intensity for about 18 hours, Dog began a weakening trend as it made a sharp turn to the west. It accelerated to the north on September 10, and two days later Dog passed within of Cape Cod. Newspapers attributed heavy rainfall in the Mid-Atlantic states‚Äîwhich resulted in five deaths‚Äîto the hurricane. Further north, the hurricane killed 12 people in New England, and produced a total of $2 million (1950 USD, $ USD) of property damage. Twelve others died in two shipwrecks off the coast of Canada. The hurricane later became a strong extratropical cyclone, maintaining hurricane-force winds while passing south of Nova Scotia and eventually hitting Scotland with hurricane-force gusts on September 18. =Hurricane Easy= Hurricane Easy developed on September 1 from a trough in the western Caribbean, which persisted after Hurricane Baker moved through the region in late August. Moving northeastward, the hurricane crossed Cuba on September 3 and entered the Gulf of Mexico. Easy turned to the northwest and strengthened to its peak intensity as a Category 3 hurricane. At the time, Easy was located just off the west coast of Florida; however, a ridge to its north caused the hurricane to stall, execute a small loop, and make landfall near Cedar Key. Following the landfall, Easy moved offshore, turned to the southeast, and made a second landfall near Hernando Beach on September 6\\\\. The hurricane turned northwestward over the Florida Peninsula, and gradually weakened as it moved into Georgia and the southeastern United States. On September 9, Easy dissipated over northeastern Arkansas. Damage in Cuba was minor, although large portions of western Florida experienced hurricane-force winds and heavy rainfall. Yankeetown reported of precipitation in 24 hours, which at the time was the largest 24-hour rainfall total on record in the United States. The cumulative total rainfall on Yankeetown from Easy was , which still retains the record for the wettest tropical cyclone in Florida. Damage was heaviest in Cedar Key, where half of the houses were destroyed and most of the remaining were damaged. The rainfall caused heavy crop damage in the region. Across the state, Easy caused $3 million in damage (1950 USD), the total was less than expected, due to the sparse population of the affected area. Additionally, the hurricane was indirectly responsible for two deaths by electrocution. At the time, Easy was also known as the \\"Cedar Keys Hurricane\\". =Hurricane Fox= On September 8, Tropical Storm Fox was present in the open Atlantic Ocean between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde, likely originating from a tropical wave. Hurricane Fox was first discovered by Hurricane Hunters on September 10, when it was located about east of Puerto Rico. A small system, the hurricane moved generally northwestward and gradually intensified. After turning toward the north, Fox reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of on September 14, as it passed about east of Bermuda. Following its peak intensity, the hurricane accelerated to the north and northeast. By September 17, Fox had lost all tropical characteristics, and later that day the circulation dissipated about halfway between the Azores and Newfoundland. Fox never affected land along its path. When Fox dissipated, it was the first time in 36 days without an active tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean. =Hurricane George= Tropical Storm George originated on September 27 from a strong tropical wave northeast of the Lesser Antilles and southeast of Bermuda. A large system, it moved to the northwest and later west-northwest. George began strengthening on September 30 as it decreased its forward speed. The next day, while remaining nearly stationary south of Bermuda, a nearby ship reported that George had reached hurricane status. It continued moving very slowly, passing only south of Bermuda. The island experienced winds of . Aside from rainbands, little impact was reported on Bermuda. The hurricane passed west of Bermuda on October 3\\\\. A day later, George reached its maximum intensity, attaining sustained winds of ; in its small eye, an Air Force Hurricane Hunter plane measured a central pressure of . It accelerated to the north and later to the northeast, and on October 5 George transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Shortly thereafter, it passed just south of Newfoundland, and on October 7 the remnants of George dissipated south of Iceland. =Tropical Storm How= A weak trough existed in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on September 29\\\\. A circulation developed within the storm, becoming a tropical depression on October 1\\\\. Later that day, the system intensified into Tropical Storm How. Initially, the tropical storm moved west-northwestward and its sustained winds peaked by October 2, estimated at . Officials advised small boats to remain at port along the Louisiana coast due to the storm. On October 3, Tropical Storm How turned toward the southwest as it began weakening, and the next day it moved ashore near La Pesca, Tamaulipas as a tropical depression. About six hours after making landfall, How dissipated over the Sierra Madre Oriental in northeastern Mexico. =Hurricane Item= On October 4, a trough was present in the western Caribbean Sea, and was possibly a tropical cyclone. Moving northwest, the system crossed the Yucat√°n Peninsula and became disrupted, while also associating with a cold front. It emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on October 7 and became more defined. On the next day, the system developed into Tropical Storm Item off the northwest coast of the Yucat√°n Peninsula. The storm moved to the southwest and intensified into a hurricane on October 9, reaching peak winds of on the next day based on Hurricane Hunters observations. It is possible that Item was stronger, due to the storm's small size but lack of direct observations. On October 11, the hurricane made landfall at 04:00 UTC near Nautla, Veracruz, with peak gusts of . The hurricane quickly dissipated over land. In the sparsely populated area where Item moved ashore, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall. Newspaper reports considered it the worst storm to hit Mexico in ten years, with damage in Veracruz totaling around $1.5 million (1950 USD, $ USD). The strong winds sank 20 ships, and although there were no reports of casualties, Item caused 15 injuries. Communications were disrupted across the region, and downed trees blocked roads. Near Tuxpam, the winds damaged large areas of banana plantations. =Hurricane Jig= A tropical storm was first observed on October 11 in the central Atlantic Ocean, northeast of the Lesser Antilles and southeast of Bermuda. Two days later, a ship reported strong winds and a rapid pressure drop, indicating a hurricane was in the region; the tropical cyclone was given the name Jig. It moved northwestward, steadily intensifying before turning to the north and northeast. On October 15, Hurricane Jig passed about east of Bermuda, and later that day its sustained winds reach peak winds of , although the intensity was uncertain, based on estimates from the Hurricane Hunters. The hurricane began weakening on October 16\\\\. Jig became an extratropical cyclone later that day and quickly dissipated, never having affected land due to its small size. =Hurricane King= A trough was present in the western Caribbean on October 11\\\\. It is estimated that a tropical depression developed just off the north coast of Honduras on October 13, which moved northeastward and intensified into Tropical Storm King the next day. The tropical storm was a small weather system throughout its duration. On October 16, King reached hurricane strength while the passing between Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. The next day, King struck Cuba near Camag√ºey, Cuba with winds of , equivalent to an upper-end Category 1 hurricane. The hurricane killed seven people and caused $2 million (1950 USD, $ USD) in damage throughout the country. After crossing Cuba, King rapidly deepened as it turned toward South Florida, becoming the sixth and final major hurricane of the season on October 18\\\\. King made landfall around 04:30 UTC on October 18, with estimated winds of , or a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale; it was the most severe hurricane to impact the city since the 1926 Miami hurricane. As it approached Miami, the hurricane had a radius of maximum winds of , and a minimum pressure of was reported as King moved across the city. The swath of destructive winds was only , likened to a small tornado. Early on October 19, King weakened to tropical storm status over north-central Florida, and on the next day it dissipated over western Georgia. There was one additional death in Georgia. Across Florida, damage totaled $27.75 million (1950 USD, $ USD), of which $15 million (1950 USD, $ USD) was in the Miami metropolitan area. A preliminary survey indicated there were 12,290 houses damaged in the region, with an additional eight destroyed. Along its path through the state, strong winds were observed around Lake Okeechobee, with a gust in Clewiston. Overall, there were three deaths in the state. =Tropical Storm Twelve= A tropical storm was present in the east-central Atlantic on October 17\\\\. It moved northwestward at first before turning to the northeast on October 19, when it was already a small, compact tropical cyclone. The storm steadily intensified as it tracked toward the Azores, and it reached a peak intensity of on October 21\\\\. Maintaining its peak strength for 30 hours, the storm began a steady weakening trend before crossing through the southern Azores. It turned to the southeast, weakening to tropical depression status on October 24\\\\. Subsequently, the system turned to the south and quickly dissipated. This tropical storm was not included in the Monthly Weather Review's summary of the 1950 hurricane season, and it was added to the Atlantic hurricane database in 1959. =Hurricane Love= In the wake of Hurricane King moving northward through Florida, an area of low pressure developed into a tropical cyclone on October 18 south of Louisiana. This storm was given the name Love and quickly strengthened, reaching hurricane status shortly thereafter. The storm initially moved westward across the Gulf of Mexico, but soon swung southward into the central portion of the Gulf on October 19\\\\. Hurricane Love's maximum sustained winds are believed to have reached their peak intensity early on October 20. Throughout the hurricane's track, dry air infringed on the western side of the tropical cyclone's circulation, which produced unfavorable conditions for additional tropical cyclogenesis. On October 20, the storm began curving northeastward towards the coast of western Florida; however, the dry air completely circled Love's center of circulation, drastically weakening the cyclone in the process. On October 21, Love weakened to a tropical storm, and it struck the Big Bend region of Florida, north of Cedar Key. At the time, its winds were only of moderate gale force, and the storm degenerated into a trough of low pressure shortly thereafter. This combined with an approaching cold front to produce a powerful extratropical storm. Certain areas began preparing for the storm along Florida's west coast. Hospitals set up emergency facilities in case of power failure, and some coastal residents left their homes. Initially, the storm was forecast to strike the Tampa area, but missed to the north as it weakened. It reportedly left little damage in the sparsely populated land where it made landfall. =Tropical Storm Mike= A westerly moving trough was evident in the east-central Atlantic Ocean on October 24, south of a dissipating cold front. Ships in the region reported light winds, and surface observations suggested that a circulation developed by October 25; on that basis, it is estimated that a tropical depression formed. A nearby ship reported gale-force winds on October 27, suggesting that it intensified into a tropical storm with peak winds of . An approaching cold front turned the storm northward, which absorbed the storm on October 28\\\\. The Air Weather Service (AWS) noted the system as \\"Storm Mike\\", but the storm was not included in the annual Monthly Weather Review summary, nor was it included in the database until it was added by the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project in 2014. =Tropical Storm Fifteen= Ships in the eastern Atlantic Ocean suggested that a tropical storm was present on October 28 with peak winds of . It was estimated to have originated the previous day. The small storm moved to the northwest and later west into an area of sparse observations, suggesting a weaker system. The system's track ended on October 29 due to uncertainty, but it was estimated to have dissipated soon after. =Tropical Storm Sixteen= For several days in November, a trough was present across the west-central Atlantic Ocean. On November 10, three ships reported a cyclonic circulation northeast of Bermuda, with peak winds of . It was a large system, and would likely have been classified a subtropical cyclone in the satellite era. The storm moved northeastward and weakened, degenerating into a trough on November 12 before being merging with another system. Storm names This was the first season in the Atlantic hurricane database in which cyclones that attained at least tropical storm status were given names. The names used to name storms during the 1950 season were taken from the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet, which was also used in the 1951 and 1952 hurricane seasons before being replaced by female names in 1953. Names that were not assigned are marked in . { width=100%  *Able *Baker *Charlie *Dog *Easy *Fox *George *How *Item  *Jig *King *Love *Mike     } Season effects This is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 1950 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a tropical wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in 1950 USD.

He was appointed to the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong on 8 April 2013 as a non-permanent judge from other common law jurisdictions.Top court gets new permanent judge Early life and education Justice Gummow completed his secondary education at Sydney Grammar School. He went on to study at the University of Sydney, where he graduated as Bachelor of Arts, and later Master of Laws, both with first-class honours. One of his lecturers was Sir Anthony Mason. Career =Early legal career= Gummow first practiced as a solicitor with law firm Allen Allen and Hemsley. He was admitted as a solicitor in 1966 and became a partner of the firm in 1969. He had a diverse practice, including banking law, trusts and revenue law, intellectual property litigation, commercial transactions and some constitutional law. =Barristerial career= After 10 years in practice as a solicitor, Gummow was called to the New South Wales Bar in 1976. At the bar, his practice included equity, commercial, tax and intellectual property matters. It also included large constitutional issues and in several cases he appeared as a junior to then Commonwealth Solicitor-General, Maurice Byers. Gummow was appointed a Queen's Counsel in 1986. =Judicial career= In 1986, Justice Gummow was appointed to the Federal Court of Australia. He was appointed to the High Court of Australia in April 1995. He retired from the High Court on 8 October 2012, upon reaching the constitutionally mandatory retirement age of 70.Constitution of Australia, section 72. On 8 April 2013, he was appointed to the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong as a non-permanent judge from other common law jurisdictions. =Academic career= For 30 years, from the year of his graduation until his appointment as a judge, Gummow taught at the Faculty of Law at the University of Sydney. He lectured in equity from 1970 to 1995. Gummow's essay Legal Education (1988) emphasised the importance of statutes and legal history; areas he considers were and are insufficiently taught in Australian law schools. He further advocated the need for practitioners in legal education, who were exposed to 'the law in action'. Following his retirement from the High Court of Australia, Gummow was appointed a Professor of the Sydney Law School, where he gives guest lectures, and a Professor at the Australian National University (ANU) College of Law,http://law.anu.edu.au/anu-college-law/anu-feature/justice-gummow- appointed-anu-professor where he teaches in the constitutional, equity, conflict of laws and refugee law programs. Jurisprudence Gummow's judgments are notable for their careful attention to statutory language and context, and are marked by a thorough and scholarly examination of doctrinal history. Gummow is particularly known for his contribution to intellectual property law and equity. Any attempt to select notable judgments of Justice Gummow is made difficult because he is so often a participant in joint judgments, whose authorship cannot be attributed. However, some of his more notable individual opinions include: Breen v Williams, Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions for New South Wales, The Wik Peoples v The State of Queensland, Hill trading as R F Hill & Associates v Van Erp, Pyrenees Shire Council v Day, Scott v Davis, Roxborough v Rothmans of Pall Mall, and Al-Kateb v Godwin. Gummow is also the author of, or participant in, numerous leading judgments in intellectual property law. See, for example: Werner & Co v Bailey Aluminium Products (1989), Advanced Building Systems v Ramset Fasteners (1998), Prestige Group v Dart Industries (1990), ConAgra v McCain Foods (1992). Statistics in recent years have consistently shown Justice Gummow to be most likely to participate or be joined in a majority opinion. He only dissented once in 2006, out of 55 judgments. (2007) 30(1) University of New South Wales Law Journal 188. Justice Gummow also often joins with Justice Hayne; in 2006 this number was 40 (75.47%) joint judgments. Similarly, in the same year Justices Gummow and Hayne joined each other in judgment in all 11 constitutional cases. Michael McHugh, who served on the court with Gummow for ten years, has called Gummow as a \\"great judicial politician\\", referring to his ability to convince other justices of the court to join in his opinions. Publications Gummow has written extensively and has published numerous essays and articles. He is the author of books including Change and Continuity: Statute, Equity, and Federalism, which is based upon the lectures he delivered at Oxford University in 1999 as part of the Clarendon law lectures series. These lectures take up themes of continuity and change in the law, particularly as they appear in the great common law jurisdictions. He is a co-author of Jacobs' Law of Trusts in Australia, and Equity: Doctrines and Remedies, the pre-eminent text on equity in Australia. Gummow also wrote, with Dyson Heydon and Robert Austin, several editions of Cases and Materials on Equity and Trusts (4th ed, 1993). Personal life Gummow is unmarried and protective of his personal life. Honours Gummow was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC), Australia's highest civil honour, in 1997, and awarded the Centenary Medal in 2001. The University of Sydney honoured Gummow's scholarly contributions to the law by conferring him with an honorary doctorate in law (LLD).

The bridge, which was given Grade II listed structure protection in 1983, was designed by W. R. Galbraith and built by Brassey & Ogilvie for the London and South Western Railway. The bridge is part of an extension to the latter company's railway line from Acton Junction to Richmond. The bridge was opened in 1869 and consists of five wrought iron lattice girder spans of 35 metres each. The cast iron piers are decorated in three stages. During the second world war a pillbox was built to guard it on the south end, along with an open enclosure to fire an anti-tank gun from. The bridge carries two tracks which are electrified with both third rail and London Underground-style fourth rail. It is now owned by Network Rail and used by London Overground for North London Line passenger trains running between Richmond and Stratford. The same tracks are also used by London Underground's District line trains running between Richmond and Upminster. In 1964 the north arch under Kew Railway Bridge was acquired by Strand on the Green Sailing Club, and has been rented from British Rail and its heirs ever since. In fiction In The Dalek Invasion of Earth, a 1964 serial from the BBC's Doctor Who, the TARDIS materialises under Kew Railway Bridge, where it is subsequently trapped when the bridge collapses. A District Line service can also be seen crossing the bridge in the 1965 film Four in the Morning.

Biography He was born at Karlsruhe. His father, a retired major in the Baden army, was a civil engineer and member of the commission for regulating the course of the Rhine; his mother, n√©e Josephine Krederer, the daughter of a prosperous tradesman at Oberndorf am Neckar, was a woman of great intellectual powers and of a romantic disposition. Young Scheffel was educated at the lyceum at Karlsruhe and afterwards (1843‚Äì1847) at the universities of Munich, Heidelberg and Berlin. After passing the state examination for admission to the judicial service, he graduated Doctor juris and for four years (1848‚Äì1852) held an official position at the town of S√§ckingen. Here he wrote his poem Der Trompeter von S√§ckingen (The trumpeter of Saeckingen) (1853), a romantic and humorous tale which immediately gained extraordinary popularity. It has reached more than 250 editions and was made into an opera by Viktor Nessler in 1884. Scheffel next undertook a journey to Italy. Returning home in 1853 he found his parents more than ever anxious that he should continue his legal career. But in 1854, defective eyesight incapacitated him; he quit the government service and took up his residence at Heidelberg, with the intention of preparing himself for a post on the teaching staff of the university. His studies were, however, interrupted by eye disease, and in search of health he proceeded to Switzerland and took up his abode on the Lake of Constance, and elaborated the plan of his famous historical romance Ekkehard (1857); (Eng. trans. by Sofie Delffs, Leipzig, 1872). A memorial to von Scheffel in the Heidelberg Castle Schlossgarten (Hortus Palatinus). The first ideas for this work he got from the Monumenta Germaniae Historica. It was hardly less popular than the Trompeter von S√§ckingen. In 1901 it reached the 179th edition. Scheffel next returned to Heidelberg, and published Gaudeamus, Lieder aus dem Engeren und Weiteren (1868), a collection of joyous and humorous songs, the subject- matter of which is taken partly from German legends and partly from historical subjects. In these songs the author shows himself the light-hearted student, a friend of wine and song; and their success is unexampled in German literature and encouraged numerous imitators. One example is Im schwarzen Walfisch zu Askalon, the lyrics reflect an endorsement of the bacchanalian mayhem of student life. The song describes an 'old assyrian' drinking binge with some references to the Classics. The large invoice is being provided in cuneiform on six brick stones. However the carouser has to admit that he left his money already in Nineves' Lamb inn and gets kicked out. In typical manner of Scheffel, it contains an anachronistic mixture of various times and eras, parodistic notions on current science,Introduction to German Poetry: A Dual- Language Book, Gustave Mathieu, Guy Stern Courier Dover Publications, 31.05.2012, including as well a translation as e.g. Historical criticism. There are various additional verses, including political parody and verses mocking different sorts of fraternities or even one just and only one for mathematics.History of Mathematics: A Supplement C. Smory≈Ñski, Springer Science & Business Media, 2008 The song has been used as name for traditional students inns, e.g. in Heidelberg. Scheffel however had some melancholic notions as well, as for the unsuccessful German revolution of 1848 and his personal disappointment in vowing for the love of his live, Emma Heim, 1851 had him disappointed as well. He also used natural science to mock the political environment, as he mocked Hegel with his Guano poem or referred to the course of time in his Ichthyosaurus poem. Indirectly, Scheffel coined the expression Biedermeier for the pre 1848 age, as two of Scheffel poems Biedermanns Abendgem√ºtlichkeit and Bummelmaiers Klage, based on the poetry of teacher and poet Samuel Friedrich Sauter, published 1848, were used in later satires about the reactionary petty bourgeois. For two years (1857‚Äì1859) Scheffel was custodian of the library of Prince Egon von F√ºrstenberg at Donaueschingen, but giving up his appointment in 1850, visited Joseph von La√überg, at Meersburg on the Lake of Constance, stayed for a while with the grand duke Charles Alexander of Saxe-Weimar at the Wartburg in Thuringia, then, settling at Karlsruhe, he married in 1864 Caroline von Malzen, and, in 1872, retired to his Villa Seehalde near Radolfzell on the lower Lake of Constance. On the occasion of his jubilee (1876), which was celebrated all over Germany, he was granted a patent of hereditary nobility by the grand duke of Baden. He died at Karlsruhe on 9 April 1886.  Heritage  Joseph Kyselak was described in Scheffels poem 'Aggstein', illustration about 1860 1891 Joseph St√∂ckle (1844‚Äì1893) founded the Scheffelbund in Schwetzingen (now Karlsruhe), the largest literary society in Germany with about 7.000 members. The Scheffelprize is dedicated to excellent pupils. There are various Scheffel memorials, street and place names.
