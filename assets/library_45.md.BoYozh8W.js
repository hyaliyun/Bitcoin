This system imposes a tax that is proportional to the total impervious area on a particular property, including concrete or asphalt driveways and roofs, that do not allow rain to infiltrate. In other words, the more area covered by impervious surfaces the more stormwater is generated and conveyed to the sewer, so the higher the stormwater fee.  Germany  Equivalence issues were raised concerning the imposition of sewage fees based on the usage of water supply. In 1985, in order to ensure the legal equity of charging based on the polluter pays principle, the German Federal Administrative Court and the local high court ruled that the sewage system charges should be separately collected as usage fees for rainwater exclusion and as usage fees for sewage exclusion. This ruling became a decisive motive to bring about a switch in the sewage system for rainwater in Germany. The German states took legal action to impose a stormwater tax on developers like the builders who made artificial surface in the 1990s. Many resistances were raised, but Berlin, which had been the strongest opponent, has accepted the plan since 2000. About 73 percent of cities with a population of 100,000 or more apply a separate calculation method, which divides the cost of sewage into the rainwater cost. Usually, Germany calculates concrete, asphalt, and building roofs as impervious areas and charges an annual fee of $2.6 per m¬≤. Builders are installing rainfall storage tank and permeation facilities to receive reduction in fees. In addition, outdoor plant cultivation facilities and green business are also proposed as alternatives to the reduction of the stormwater fee. Germany has seen two effects in this regard : increasing rainwater recycling rates and reducing sewage fee and tap water usage. Rain water recycling plays a great role in preventing the city from flooding in the event of heavy rain and saving energy. Italy Such taxes have been collected in regions of Italy, acquiring international attention, and challenging Italian tax morale. Authorities in Ravenna, Italy, have imposed 3% increase on local water bills to maintain and improve drainage systems. Officials cite the severe damage inflicted by the heavy rain on infrastructure, buildings and agriculture in the Po valley, insisting that this money urgently needs to be recouped. The local water board, which wants to backdate the new tax three years, claims that the payments will save it ‚Ç¨1 million a year. Gianluca Dradi, head of environmental policy for the Ravenna city council, likened the levy to a street cleaning tax and clarified that those paying more for their water use, such as factories, will pay proportionately more than individual households. \\"Including the cost in water bills is more equitable,\\" he told the Repubblica newspaper. However, consumer organisations are opposing the move, and residents have been urged to resist the authorities and refuse to pay the tax. United States =Maryland= A stormwater management tax was established via House Bill 987 (April 2012) and signed into law by then-governor Martin O'Malley, affecting the largest urban jurisdictions in Maryland (nine counties and the City of Baltimore) in order to meet the requirements of the federal Clean Water Act as it concerns the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The Tax Foundation states House Bill 987 \\"was passed in response to a decree by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) formally known as the Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load, which identified mandatory reductions in nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment that damage the Chesapeake Bay.\\" This mandate from the EPA was mandated to the states of Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Maryland is the only state that has levied a tax to meet the EPA's standards. Polluted runoff is the only source in the Chesapeake Bay watershed that is still increasing, as of 2018. This tax, of course, does not tax rain but has been implemented in varying ways at the county level, such as a flat fee per property owner, or based on impervious surface square footage. The law specifies that accrued funds must be used for specified stormwater pollution-related purposes. Effective July 1, 2012. This law was modified in 2015 to make the county-assessed fees optional rather than mandatory while still holding the counties responsible for making progress on managing polluted runoff. =Illinois= HB1522 (August, 2013) provides DuPage and Peoria counties with the option of charging fees to residents whose property benefits from county stormwater management. HB1522 allows the counties to assess the tax in a nonuniform manner, based on their own rules, exemptions and special considerations. Home rule municipalities in Illinois have always had the ability to establish special fees under their own ordinances. The City of Elgin, Illinois was planning to assess the Stormwater Utility Tax in 2014, but an outraged public and decisive election results caused the Elgin City Council to unanimously reject the tax.  How to Calculate Potential Stormwater Fee * To calculate your potential Stormwater Fee, you should know \\"ERU (Equivalent Residential Unit)\\". The ERU is a measurement of the amount of impervious square footage that a typical residence contains which is calculated to be 3000 square feet based upon the aggregate of a driveway, garage roof, house roof, and miscellaneous paving. Users are categorized according to the characteristics of the business or resident. Every property will be charged monthly based upon how many ERU's it has. * Residential : Based upon the low end figure Strand Associates provided to the Council last October, one ERU for a typical residential property will cost $3 per month. On the high end, Downers Grove has a storm water utility tax and charges $8.40 per ERU per month. That translates to a fee from $36 to $100.80 annually for homeowners. * Commercial : As an example, if you own a piece of property with impervious surface totaling 9000 square feet, you divide that by 3000, resulting in 3 ERU's. Using from $3 to $8.40 per ERU above, it could cost from $108 to $302.40 annually for a business, not for profit, church, etc. References Category:Ecotax Category:Stormwater management ","title":"Stormwater fee"},{"id":"33062050","text":"In mathematics, the ≈öleszy≈Ñski‚ÄìPringsheim theorem is a statement about convergence of certain continued fractions.

It was founded in April 1990. IRF is an integral part of the Open Society Foundations which incorporates national and regional foundations in more than thirty countries around the world, primarily in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the former Soviet Union. These foundations share a common goal of supporting educational, social and legal initiatives that promote the development and establishment of an open society. IRF is the Ukraine's one of the largest charity organization. Its main objective is to provide financial and operational assistance to the development of an open and democratic society in Ukraine by supporting key civic initiatives in this area. Over the period from 1990 to 2010 the International Renaissance Foundation supported numerous Ukrainian non-governmental organizations, community groups, academic and cultural institutions, publishing houses etc. in the amount of over $100 million.  Key areas  The International Renaissance Foundation finances projects and programs which foster the development of civil society, promote rule of law and independent mass media. Funds are also allocated for diversification of information resources for the third sector, democratization of education and public health, advancing of social capital and academic publications, as well as ensuring protection of national minorities rights and their integration into Ukrainian society. IRF is providing financial support to the projects that encourage European integration, strengthening the impact of civil society and its control over the government, the system of civic protection of rights and establishment of the rule of law in Ukraine, penitentiary reform, civic activities of ethnic minorities, educational and public health reforms, publishing activities etc. IRF's Executive Board and Program Boards determine the program priorities. Composed of prominent public figures and experts, the Boards address IRF's key action areas: civil society, rule of law, education, mass media, health care etc. As the chief civic structure within IRF, it elaborates the general strategy for the entire organization.  Transparency  IRF keeps public informed of its programs and their implementation through publications in print media, by holding news conferences and presentations, via the Internet etc. Foundation employees, as well as its regional information partners consult public on IRF-supported projects and grants.  Principles  IRF makes its grants only to non- governmental organizations. As a rule, the International Renaissance Foundation announces project competitions in advance. Grants are made to Ukrainian organizations whose projects meet the priorities of the competitions. At the same time, IRF considers applications of citizens regarding the financing of various projects, whose aims meet the Foundation‚Äôs objectives. Apart from making grants to other organizations, IRF conducts its own operational activities by implementing projects in priority action areas. IRF finances national programs from its budget upon the recommendations of the Executive Board and Program Boards. The Foundation's experience in Ukraine and its close cooperation with other donor organizations in Central and Eastern Europe make it possible to monitor changes in Ukrainian society. Moreover, IRF attempts to predict these changes. IRF program activities are predominantly oriented to the European experience.

That is why we decided to try > it in Jakarta. Kids watched AKB on the internet and they want to do the > same, but they don't know whether they have talent. Also it's difficult [for > them] to go to Japan to audition.\\" Then Rakuten‚ÄìMNC chief marketing officer Reino Barack and Arya Sinulingga recounted of his visit to Japan: > \\"When I watched AKB48's theater performance in Akihabara, I sensed the > potential for a new business in Indonesia.\\"  History  = 2011‚Äì2012: Formation = JKT48 performs in September 2012 On 11 September 2011, the formation of JKT48 was announced at an AKB48 event held at Makuhari Messe in Chiba, Japan. Applicant interviews took place the following weeks, in late September 2011, and the first auditions were held a month after the initial announcement, from 8‚Äì9 October 2011. AKB48 member Minami Takahashi also visited Jakarta during the auditions to promote JKT48 among fans of AKB48. Although applicants did not have to be Indonesian citizens, they did have to already reside in the country. Approximately 1,200 girls auditioned for the group, and 51 were selected to proceed to the second round. Finalists were judged based on their dance performance of \\"Heavy Rotation\\", from AKB48's single of the same name, and their performance of a song of their choice. JKT48's 28 first generation members, ages 12‚Äì21, were selected on 2 November 2011. On 17 December 2011, JKT48 made its first public appearance on the live music program 100% Ampuh on Global TV, performing \\"Heavy Rotation\\", with lyrics translated into Indonesian. As part of the concept of \\"idols you can meet every day\\", AKB48 performs daily at its theater in Akihabara. The JKT48 management team aimed to accomplish this same principle and began scouting locations in Jakarta for the group's own theater in early 2012. An unoccupied site in the fX Sudirman shopping mall was selected as the theater's eventual location, and planning for its renovation began in April. In the meantime, the first theater performances were held 17‚Äì20 May 2012 at a temporary stage in the Nyi Ageng Serang Building in Kuningan, Jakarta. The official theater opened on 8 September 2012 for daily performances with a set list of 16 songs that have been translated into Indonesian. The theater first had a seating capacity of 180 and standing room for 30, and its design is a close replica of the AKB48 Theater. Currently it holds around 350 people, both seated and standing. JKT48 has also performed in Japan alongside other AKB48 sister groups. In its first performance in Japan, the group was a surprise guest at 2011 AKB48 K≈çhaku Taik≈ç Uta Gassen and performed the Indonesian version of \\"Aitakatta\\". It also performed alongside AKB48 and other sister groups at the 62nd NHK K≈çhaku Uta Gassen with a total 210 members onstage. It also participated in the 2012 AKB48 concerts at Saitama Super Arena and Tokyo Dome. On 13 August 2012, management began accepting applications for second generation members. Of the 4,500 applicants, approximately 200 were selected for interviews the following month. The pool was then narrowed down from 67 to 31 in a selection round held by RCTI. All 31 finalists were eventually chosen as second generation members at a final audition on 3 November in Japan. Additionally, AKB48 members Aki Takaj≈ç and Haruka Nakagawa, whose transfers to JKT48 were announced at the Tokyo Dome concert, officially began their activities with the group on 1 November and made their theater debut on 26 December. Nakagawa became interested in Jakarta during a visit with other members of AKB48 earlier in February 2012. = 2013‚Äìpresent: Ups and downs = The group's logo JKT48 was scheduled to release its debut album in January 2013, but production was hampered because of flooding in Jakarta.

Harris Thayeb, President Director of the group's promotional agent Dentsu Media Group Indonesia, believed the group's concept \\"will make our idols more down to earth, being always nice and able to be greeted anytime\\". The group was seen as part of the \\"Cool Japan\\" brand adopted by the Japanese government to promote the country's culture around the world. On 25 February 2012, JKT48 held a joint concert with AKB48 at the Japan Pop Culture Festival at Balai Kartini in Jakarta. The event was sponsored by the Embassy of Japan, the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs, and the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy. According to Junji Shimada, deputy to the Japanese ambassador, AKB48 was invited to perform because of its status as a Japanese pop icon, and the two sister groups represent the friendship between Japan and Indonesia. JKT48 appeared in television shows almost daily after its debut and in television advertisements by Japanese companies that intend to capture a share of the rapidly growing Indonesian market. Otsuka Pharmaceutical hired JKT48 to promote the company's Pocari Sweat beverages one month after the group's first members were announced. Sharp Corporation selected JKT48 to appear at the company's promotional events, and Yamaha Motor Company hired the group in order to promote its line of fuel efficient Mio J scooters to Indonesian teens. Ezaki Glico also featured the group in its advertisements as part of an effort to grow sales in Indonesia to over Rp1 billion. Teenagers and single young men make up the largest portion of the JKT48 and AKB48 fan base. Furthermore, some believe JKT48's idol concept does not fit the Indonesian culture.

Prior to World War II, it was the only national library in Japan. It is one of the predecessors of the current National Diet Library. History The Imperial Library of Japan was established as the under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education on September 3, 1872. The library was housed within the Yushima Seid≈ç and combined the functions of both a library and a museum, and inherited the surviving documents held by the Tokugawa shogunate prior to the Meiji Restoration. This collection evolved into the in 1875, which was made a deposit library for all publications in Japan and was renamed the Tokyo Prefectural Library in 1877 and the Tokyo Library in 1880. It was relocated to Ueno in 1885. Its first director was Tanaka Inagi (Áî∞‰∏≠Á®≤Âüé). In 1890, then director Tanaka Inagi visited the Library of Congress in the United States and major national libraries in Europe with the aim of creating a similar facility in Japan. As a result, in April 1897, the Tokyo Library was renamed the Imperial Library, and began to assume the functions of a national library. A new building to house the Imperial Library was completed on March 20, 1906 in Ueno Park. At the time of the transfer, the collection contained approximately 470,000 volumes. This grew to over 1 million volumes by the end of World War II. However, from the start, the library was plagued by the lack of adequate budgets, and by lack of space to accommodate all volumes necessary. The collection escaped major damage in the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake, and was evacuated to the countryside during World War II and thus escaped destruction in the Tokyo air raids. As of 31 March 1908, it held 244,483 books, of which 194,500 were Japanese and Chinese books. Due to censorship requirements, the Home Ministry operated a review office in the basement of the Imperial Library. Following the end of World War II, the Imperial Library was renamed the National Library in December 1947, and was again renamed the National Diet Library in 1948. The former building of the Imperial Library of Japan now houses the International Library of Children's Literature.

Orthodox Christian names constitute a fair proportion of Russian given names, but there are many exceptions including pre-Christian Slavic names, Communist names, and names taken from ethnic minorities in Russia. Given names form a distinct area of the Russian language with some unique features. The evolution of Russian given names dates back to the pre-Christian era, though the list of common names changed drastically after the adoption of Christianity. In medieval Russia two types of names were in use: canonical names given at baptism (calendar or Christian names, usually modified) and non-canonical. The 14th century was marked by the elimination of non-canonical names, that ended by the 18th century. In the 20th century after the October Revolution the whole idea of a name changed. It was a completely new era in the history of Russian names, marked by significant changes in common names. The names of popular saints are known as \\"calendar names\\" from their occurrence in the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar. A common custom is to name the baby for the saint who is the patron over their birthday. Such names include Ivan (, \\"John\\"), Andrei (, \\"Andrew\\"), Yakov (, \\"Jacob\\"), Yuri (, \\"George\\"), Tatyana (, \\"Tatiana\\"), Maria (, \\"Mary\\"), Avdotia (, \\"Eudocia\\"), Elizaveta (, \\"Elizabeth\\"). The group of calendar names includes traditional names that used to be listed in orthodox menologia prior to the October Revolution and in popular calendars of the Soviet era that had been printed since the second half of the 19th century. 95% of the Russian-speaking population in the Soviet Union in the 1980s had calendar names. Ancient Slavic names include Stanislav (), Rada () and Radomir (), and Dobromila. Old Russian names include Zhdan (), Peresvet (), Lada (), and Lyubava (). Soviet-era names include Vilen (), Avangard (), Ninel (), and Era (). Names borrowed from other languages include Albert (), Ruslan (), Zhanna (), and Leyla (). The number of currently used names is relatively small. According to various estimations no more than 600 masculine and feminine names more or less regularly appear in modern generations: the main body of given names doesn't exceed 300‚Äì400. History The history of Russian given name is usually divided in three stages: * pre- Christian, period of pagan names, created by means of Old-East Slavic language. * Christian, foreign Christian names began to replace old pagan names; small proportion of traditional names became canonical; * modern, starting from October Revolution, characterized by elimination of difference between canonical, calendar and non-calendar names, active borrowing and active name construction. =Before the Christian era= Before adoption of Christianity till the end of the 10th century, eastern Slavs (ancestors of modern Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians) used almost exclusively Slavonic names which were given at birth. No distinction between first name and nickname was made during this period. Given names in Old East Slavonic language (nickname, epithet, handle) are similar to appellation after a particular episode. Pre-Christian names were used in Rus' several centuries after adoption of Christianity. They were commonly used alongside Christian names till the end of 17th century. Old Slavonic names are exceptionally diverse. Dictionary of Old Slavonic names by N. M. Tupikov, printed in 1903, comprised 5300 masculine and 50 feminine names. Old Slavonic names fall in several categories: ¬´Moroz¬ª (, \\"Frost\\") used to be a personal name, hence popularity of surname Morozov * Numerical names representing birth order in a family: Perva, Pervoy (the first), Vtorak (the second), Tretyak (the third), Chetvertak (the fourth) and so on. Due to biological limitations, those names wouldn't go far beyond 10 (Desyatko). * Names based on individual characteristics, like hair and skin color. Names like Chernysh, Chernyai, Chernyava,(=black one) Bel, Belyai, Belyak, Beloukha (=white one) were widely used. Constitution features also could be reflected in a name: Mal (Small), –ú–∞–ª—é—Ç–∞, –ú–∞–ª–æ–π (Smaller), –î–æ–ª–≥–æ–π (Tall), –°—É—Ö–æ–π (thin one), –¢–æ–ª—Å—Ç–æ–π (Fat one), –ì–æ–ª–æ–≤–∞ (Head), –ì–æ–ª–æ–≤–∞—á, –õ–æ–±–∞–Ω, –ë–µ—Å–ø–∞–ª–æ–π (Fingerless). * Names describing personality, habits and behaviour.

It is believed that this kind of name is a relic of totem beliefs. * Names related to beliefs that \\"bad\\" words can deflect evil spirits, diseases and even death: –ì–æ—Ä—è–∏–Ω, –ù–µ–º–∏–ª, –ù–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Å (ugly ine), –ù–µ–ª—é–±–∞ (loveless one), –ù–µ—É—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π, –ó–ª–æ–±–∞ (Anger), –¢—É–≥–∞—Ä–∏–Ω (from —Ç—É–≥–∞ ‚Äî –ø–µ—á–∞–ª—å, sorrow). * Names related to other nations : Chudin –ß—É–¥–∏–Ω (after Chud people, —á—É–¥—å), Karel –ö–∞—Ä–µ–ª, Tatarin –¢–∞—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–Ω, Kozarin –ö–æ–∑–∞—Ä–∏–Ω (–æ—Ç –Ω–∞–∑–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è —Ö–∞–∑–∞—Ä), Ontoman –û–Ω—Ç–æ–º–∞–Ω (after Turks people, –æ—Ç—Ç–æ–º–∞–Ω—ã). All previously mentioned names fall into domestic category were used in family circle. However, when a person entered a broader social group (changing his occupation or place of residence), his name was replaced or supplemented by another. This sort of nickname exceeds family names in number - an adult has more distinct characteristics that can be used as a basis for a nickname than a child. Not all pre-Christian names were equally popular. Only some tens of several thousand names were actively used. Popularity of pagan names resulted in formation of various diminutive forms: Bychko from Byk, Zhdanko from Zhdan, Puzeika from Puzo and so on. The most popular names had many forms. For example, root -bel- produced a wide range of names like Bela, Belka, Belava, Beloy, Belonya, Belyay, Belyash. Root -sem- produced 33 names, including Semanya, Semeika and Semushka. Increasing influence of the Russian Orthodox church on social life led to gradual elimination of pagan nicknames. However, they didn't become completely extinct, as they served as basis for major part of Russian surnames (the first stage of surname formation took place in the 15th century). =Establishment of Russian naming tradition= Icon \\"–ú–∏–Ω–µ–∏ –Ω–∞ –≥–æ–¥\\" (, Year calendar) picturing all saints organized by their respective days. This kind of icons was kept in churches free to access. They were used as pictorial menologia, that even the illiterate could consult at any moment. Adoption of Christianity led to introduction of completely new, foreign names that were tightly connected to baptism ceremony: according to Christian tradition baptism presumes giving Christian name. Names were given according to special books ‚Äì minei , which described religious services, ceremonies for each day, including which saint to praise. Religious tradition dictated that children should be named in honor of a saint, praised on the day of baptism. Sometimes on birthday, sometimes any day between birth and baptism. Minei were extremely expensive, so some churches couldn't afford them. One possible solution was to use menologia () ‚Äì calendars with brief listing of religious celebrations and Saints days. Minei were among the first books to be translated into Russian from Greek. With a rare exceptions names were not translated, preserving their original pronunciation. Their meaning was completely obscure for vast majority of people and they were perceived as alien. This state of things led on the one hand to long coexistence of Christian and pagan names and to active assimilation and transformation of Christian names. Coexistence of old and new names Christian and pagan names coexisted up to the 17th century. One of the reasons is that parents could not choose a name for a child freely ‚Äì a newborn was baptized according to the menologium. Sometimes several children in one family would bear one name. Furthermore, the total number of names in the menologium at the time didn't exceed 400. Pagan nicknames being more diverse and less restrictive provided a convenient way to distinguish people bearing one name. A practice established in the 14th to 16th centuries supposed giving two names: a baptismal name (usually modified) and a nickname. For example: Trofimko Czar (Torpes the Czar), Fedka Knyazets, Karp Guba, Prokopiy Gorbun (Procopius the Humpback), Amvrosiy Kovyazin, Sidorko Litvin. This practice was widespread in all stratas. Boyar Andrei Kobyla (lit. Andrew the Mare) a progenitor of Romanov dynasty and some other boyar families man serve as an example as well his sons' names: Semyon Zherebets (Semyon the Stallion), Aleksandr Yolka (Alexandre the Spruce), Fyodor Koshka (Fyodor the Cat). Craftsmen did name their children in the same manner. For example, Ivan Fyodorov the first man to print a book often signed as Ivan Fyodorov, son of Moskvit (). Influence of Russian Orthodox church steadily grew in 11th‚Äì14th centuries, its influence as a consolidating religious force after Mongol invasion of Rus and during period of feudal fragmentation in Kiev Rus became especially important. Unification of Russian feudal states also contributed to raise of church's influence on policy and society. Under influence of the church many knyazes, descendants of Rurik, began to abandon their pagan names in favor of Christian names. =Separation of Baptismal, Popular and Literary forms= In XVII names divided in the three distinct forms: popular (spoken), literary and baptismal (church form). This process was boosted by Patriarch Nikon's reform. One of the ventures he undertook was to correct religious books, which had accumulated a lot of errors and misreading as they used to be copied by sometimes illiterate scribes. As a result, religious services differed in different parts of the country. Patriarch Nikon set goal to unify service in Russia and to correct errors in religious books (including menologia). New translations from Greek were made to achieve this goal. Corrected versions were printed in 1654. =Early Soviet Union= Modern era begins right after October Revolution. The decree \\"On Separation of Church from State and Schools from Church\\" outlawed connection of any public and social acts with religious ceremonies. Since that baptism ceased to be a legally binding act. The right to register names was handed to civil authorities, namely civil registry. As a result, the whole conception of name changed. Naming no longer depended on religious traditions and rules. Direct and tight connection with orthodox saints names was lost. Any citizen was free to choose a name he wished for himself and his children. As a matter of fact, any word could be used as a name; function of civil registry was reduced to proper registration of citizens. Social innovations gave incentive to develop \\"new names for new life\\". Mikhail Frunze, a high-ranked soviet officer, Civil war veteran was among the first to use a new name, naming his son Timur. Another example is the case of Demyan Bedny, a well-known atheistic activist who named his son Svet. The Soviet writer Artem Veseliy named his daughter Volga. Since 1924 Gosizdat started issuing calendars similar to those that had existed prior to the Revolution. This new kind of calendars included traditional but rare names given without reference to saints as well as new names. New names comprised non-baptismal names, both Russian and Slavic, borrowed names and newly formed names. Calendars of 1920-30 being a good reference wasn't the only source of names. As mentioned above, parents were free to pick any name they wished, and this freedom led to active name formation, which later was dubbed \\"anthroponymic bang\\". Formal Russian name and its derivative forms =Legal given name= According to Russian naming tradition in official speech people are addressed by their name followed by a patronymic. In official situations one's given name is always written or spoken in its legal form (name given at birth and documented in papers like birth certificate and passport). Prior to October Revolution canonical form was considered official. It was documented in baptismal register books. However, in birth certificate and other documents a secular form was used. Arising ambiguity was not considered important and didn't cause any legal consequences. In baptismal register books people bearing names Yuriy and Egor appeared as Georgy, but in other documents they could use the variant they were used to. Russian internal passport After the Revolution various forms of one name started being considered as different names. Names from the example above ‚Äì Georgy, Yegor and Yuriy became legally different names after the Revolution. Generally, names are considered to be different if they during assimilation acquired significant differences as in following cases: * Names have different initials: Elena and Alyona, Irina and Arina, Anastasia and Nastasya, Iosif and Osip, Yuliania and Ulyana. * Differing in stem: Georgiy and Yuriy, Cyprian and Cupryan, Evstafiy and Ostap. There are names which, being legally different, are considered the same in common usage and share short forms, like Nataliya and Natalya (short form ‚Äì Natasha). =Full (formal) and short forms= As opposed to full forms used in formal situations, short forms of a name are used in communication between well-acquainted people, usually relatives, friends and colleagues. Short forms emerged in spoken language for convenience as majority of formal names are cumbersome. They are often multi-syllabic or otherwise phonetically aberrant. Short forms, being stylistically neutral, demonstrate that people using them are in close relationships and equal statuses. In cases where elder people address younger ones, short names also are stylistically neutral. Short form were derived from truncated stems of full forms, sometimes preserving very little in common. There are traditional short form, formed by adding -a or -ya suffix to a truncated stem of a name: Valer(y) ‚Üí Valera, Fyod(or) ‚Üí Fedya, Rom(an) ‚Üí Roma, Pyot(r) ‚Üí Petya, Ol(ga) ‚Üí Olya, Vic(toriya) ‚Üí Vika. Such transformation results in a short word ending with an open syllable, convenient to address or call a person. Russian language has neutral suffixes that are used (sometimes with -a and -ya) with more radically truncated stems: * -sh-: Ma(ria) ‚Üí Masha, Pa(vel) ‚Üí Pasha, Mi(khail) ‚Üí Misha, Da(rya) ‚Üí Dasha, (A)le(ksey) ‚Üí Lyosha, (Alek)sa(ndr) ‚Üí Sasha; * -n-: Ma(ria) ‚Üí Manya, So(fya) ‚Üí Sonya, Ta(tyana) ‚Üí Tanya, Ga(vriil) ‚Üí Ganya, Ge(nnadiy) ‚Üí Gena, (An)to(nina) ‚Üí Tonya, A(nna) ‚Üí Anya; * -k-: (Fe)li(zia) ‚Üí Lika, I(gor') ‚Üí Ika, Mi(khail) ‚Üí Mika; * -s- and -us-: Lyud(mila) ‚Üí Lyuda, (A)ga(fya) ‚Üí Gasya, (Ev)d(okiya) ‚Üí Dusya etc.. Unrestrained derivation of new names made possible coexistence of multiple short forms of the same name. For example, Irina ‚Üí Rina, Risha, Irisha, Ina; Vitaliy ‚Üí Vitalya, Vita, Vitya, Talya, Vitasha. On the other hand, extremely faint phonetic connection between short and full forms permits to associate one short form with many full names. For example \\"Dictionary of Russian personal names\\" by N.A. Petrovskiy corresponds Alya to 19 masculine and 18 feminine names including Aleksey, Oleg, Yuvenaliy, Aleksandr and Aleksandra, Alisa, Alla, Galina. No fan would designate Natasha Koroleva as ¬´Natalya Vladimirovna¬ª There are names for which a short form is difficult to produce. These are usually rare names like Erast, Orest, Toviy, Radiy, Rosa and suchlike. Also some (usually two-syllable) names in are traditionally used in full form even in informal conversation disregarding their short forms (Andrey, Igor, Oleg, Vera, Inna, Nina). As already stated above, the short form is generally used in spoken conversation between acquainted people and usually doesn't act as an official or public name. However starting from the late 1980s in popular culture, in artistic circles short names gained new status. They appear on posters, disk covers and are widely used in mass media. Dima Malikov, Dima Bilan, Vlad Topalov, Nastya Poleva, Tanya Bulanova, Vika Tsyganova, Lyuba Uspenskaya, Masha Rasputina, Natasha Koroleva became known under their short names. This approach is perceived as accepted part of artistic freedom. Many Russian short names are used, in slightly adapted form, as full legal given names in Serbia, Montenegro and Croatia. For example: Anja, Feƒëa, Katja/Kaƒáa, Ma≈°a, Nata≈°a, Olja, Sa≈°a, Sonja, Tanja. =Diminutive forms= Diminutive forms constitute a distinct body among various derivative forms. As opposed to full, formal names, their short forms are emotional. They demonstrate warm and tender attitude towards addressee, although some diminutive forms can bear slighting or pejorative emotions. Diminutive forms generally are used by close relatives and good friends. They are often used by parents addressing their children. Diminutive and affectionate forms are derived by adding various diminutive suffixes (-ochk-, -echk-, -onyk-, -enyk-, -ushk-, -yushk-, -yush-, -yash-, -ul-, -ush-, -un-, -us-, -k-, -ik- &c.;). Diminutive forms can be derived from both short and full names. For example: from Maria (full form) following diminutive forms can be derived: *Maria ‚Üí Maryunya, Marunya, Marusya, Maryusha, Maryushka and Maryasha. *Masha (short form) ‚Üí Mashka, Mashenyka, Mashulya. *Manya (another short form) ‚Üí Manechka, Manyusya, Manyusha, Manyasha etc. Diminutives derived with -k- suffix carry a pejorative tint, (Sashka, Grishka, Svetka etc.) This is related to a historical tradition to use semi-names to refer to oneself when speaking with a person of higher social status. However, among peers this form didn't have such a tint, indicating only simplicity in communication and close relation. Nonetheless, in modern Russian diminutives like Vasyka, Marinka, Alka are considered stylistically lowered.

Within this province, they were in the Civitas Agrippinenses, with its capital at Cologne. They are thought to have been a Germanic tribe, speaking a Germanic language, although they may also have had a mixed ancestry. They lived between the Meuse (Dutch Maas, Latin Mosa) and Rur rivers in Roman imperial times. In modern terms this was probably in the part of Germany near Aachen, J√ºlich, Eschweiler and D√ºren, and the neighbouring areas in the southern Netherlands, around Valkenburg, and eastern Belgium, in part of the old Duchy of Limburg. There is a town just over the Belgian border from Aachen called Sinnich, in Voeren, which may owe its name to them. In other words, they lived just north of the modern northern limits of Romance languages derived from Latin.  Name  The etymology of the name Sunici is uncertain. It could derive from the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root *s≈´s, *suw√≥s ('pig'), or from the PIE root *sunus ('sons'). The name may thus have meant 'the young sons', which evokes the Italic custom of the Ver Sacrum. Since the root *sunus is absent from the Celtic languages (where it was replaced with mak ∑o-), the name is probably of Germanic origin.  Geography  The Sunuci dwelled in the western part of the modern Rhineland region, around the towns of Eschweiler, Heimbach, or Kornelim√ºnster. Their territory was located between that of the Tungri and Ubii.  Religion  Dedications to their eponymous goddess 'Sunucsal(is)' have been found across their territory. She was probably regarded as the original epithet of a tribal goddess. The name may be interpreted as the Germanic form *Sunuc(a)-sali≈ç- ('whom provides the Sunici with housing').: \\"die den Sunuker Wohnm√∂glichkeit, Siedlungsraum verschafft, die die Sunuker behaust.\\"  History  The origins of the tribe are unknown, but it is likely that, like their eastern neighbours the Ubii, their ancestry included Germanic immigrants from the east of the Rhine who had been arriving for generations. Like the Cugerni for example, they may descend from Sicambri. Germania Inferior was on the west of the Rhine and had been described by Julius Caesar, at the time of Roman conquest of the area, as part of Belgic Gaul. Many of the tribal names and personal names which he reported from this area, are considered to be Celtic, not Germanic. However already long before his time there appears to have been an influx of people coming from the east of the Rhine, including, in the particular area where the Sunuci lived, the tribal grouping which Tacitus later claimed to be the original tribal group which had been called \\"Germani\\", the so-called \\"Germani Cisrhenani\\".Tacitus, Germania, II 2. ceterum Germaniae vocabulum recens et nuper additum, quoniamqui primi Rhenum transgressi Gallos expulerint ac nunc Tungri, tunc Germani vocati sint: ita nationis nomen, nongentis, evaluisse paulatim, ut omnes primum a victore obmetum, mox et a se ipsis invento nomine Germani vocarentur. Whether these original Germani had all spoken a Germanic language is unknown. Caesar and Tacitus were more interested in the fact that tribes from the east of the Rhine, who all eventually came to be referred to as Germani (the source of the modern word \\"Germany\\"), and all eventually came to speak a Germanic language, were less softened by civilization, and therefore difficult to defeat in battle or incorporate into the Roman empire. Some specific tribes who entered the empire later, such as the Ubii who lived between the Rur and the Rhine, are generally understood to be speakers of Germanic languages, and records exist concerning their immigration and settlement. However, for the Sunuci, there is no such clear record and it is their position which generally leads to them being understood as being a group settled during imperial times, and Germanic in the modern sense of speaking a Germanic language. On the other hand, there have been suggestions that they might represent the descendants, at least partly, of the Segni, one of the Germani tribes described by Caesar as having been in this region since at least the 2nd century BCE when the Cimbri moved through the area. In the Naturalis Historia of Pliny the Elder described the Sunuci between the Tungri and the Frisiavones. They contributed troops to the Roman military, some of whom were stationed in Britain, including modern Wales. There is evidence from tablets found in the Rivelin Valley south of Stannington that retiring Roman auxiliaries of the Sunuci tribe stationed in Britain were made grants of citizenship and land or money in the modern day city of Sheffield, with some speculation that a Roman villa complex at Whirlow Hall Farm was part of such a land grant. (wikisource) Tacitus also mentioned the Sunuci, as a people of this region during the Batavian revolt. Some of them joined the revolt of Gaius Julius Civilis, and were opposed by Claudius Labeo, who held a bridge over the Meuse, with a force of Betasii, Tungri and NerviiTacitus, Histories (Tacitus) 4.66 Two deity names have been associated with the Sunuci, a goddess Sunuxal or Sunuxsal and a god Varnenos or Varneno. What happened to Sunuci in the later part of the Roman era is uncertain. Their territory became the home of new groups who crossed the Rhine, part of the amalgamation of tribes known as the Franks. The Franks united under kings and later became semi-independent within the empire, started moving into more populated Romanized areas to their south, and then proceeded to conquer a large part of Western Europe and found the Holy Roman empire. If any of the Sunuci remained in the area, they became part of this development.

It is regarded as the best power plant in the region with an availability of 97% and above. Uch-I Power started its commercial operation in 2000. The plant is certified for compliance with ISO9001, ISO14001 and OHSAS 18001. The plant is owned by French energy giant ENGIE. Uch-II Power Plant The recently completed gas thermal power generation project is to develop a 404 MW gas-fired combined cycle power plant Uch II as an expansion to the existing 596 MW Uch Power Station (‚ÄúUch I‚Äù) owned and operated by Uch Power (Private) Limited (‚ÄúUPL‚Äù) in Balochistan Province, Pakistan. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif inaugurated Uch II power plant in Dera Murad Jamali, Balochistan. Uch II is designed to use the supply of indigenous gas in the Uch Gas Field (‚ÄúUGF‚Äù). Uch I is also using the gas from UGF. The Project will be structured as a standalone Independent Power Plant and will be built on the site of Uch I, using the available vacant land within the Uch I property that was already acquired and fenced and will use some of the existing physical and management infrastructure. In addition to the infrastructure, the Project will benefit from synergies with the existing plant in the form of a shared management team as well as common utilization of O&M; resources and administrative staff. Similar to the operating 586 MW Uch I plant, the Project is expected to be one of the lowest cost producers of power in the country. The Project will be established under a separate project company called Uch-II Power (Private) Limited (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù). The Company will be 100% owned by International Power Plc., which is headquartered in London and is one of the world‚Äôs leading independent power generation companies with over 32,000 MW capacity worldwide. The total project cost is estimated at $500 million, and the proposed IFC investment is an A-loan for IFC‚Äôs International Finance Corporation (World Bank Group) own account of up to $100 million. The Uch Project site is located about 600 km north of Karachi and 42 km in the north west of Jacobabad, in the Dera Murad Jamali sub-district of Balochistan Province. Uch I is located within a boundary wall covering an area of about 260 hectares of land and using about 30% of the total area. Uch II will require about 83.5 hectares of the existing land including a residential colony. The transmission line to evacuate power from Uch II will be developed by a separate entity called National Transmission and Dispatch Company (‚ÄúNTDC‚Äù), a sub-division of WAPDA which is government owned. Based on the available information, NTDC is considering to develop (i) a 220 kV transmission line of about 125 km from Uch II to Sibi, (ii) a 220 kV transmission line of about 0.5 km for looping in and out of the existing Uch I Power Plant ‚Äì Shikarpur New 220 kV S/C transmission line at Uch II Power Plant, and (iii) reconductoring of 220 kV line section, about 1 km long between Uch I Power Plant and Uch II power Plant from single rail to twin bundled rail conductor. Gas will be supplied from Uch Gas Field about 47 km from Uch II site using an existing gas pipeline. For Uch I, UGF has existing dedicated 15 wells. For Uch II, additional 15 new gas wells will be developed by OGDCL (Oil and Gas Development Company Limited) to supply gas from UGF. Details of the water supply arrangement for Uch II are still to be finalized.

Each hundred had a fyrd which acted as the local defence force, and a court which was responsible for the maintenance of the frankpledge system. The hundred also formed a unit for the collection of taxes. The role of the hundred court was described in the Dooms (laws) of King Edgar. The name of the hundred was normally that of its meeting-place. The name Wells Forum was derived from the city of Wells, which lies within its limits, to which was added the word Forum, referring to Wells' market place. These were generally called Fora Venalia in Roman times, and this term added to a proper name denotes a market or borough town (e.g. Blandford Forum). The hundred of Wells Forum encompassed the ancient Forest of Mendip, which occupied the northern part; and extended to the south into the lowlands of East Sedgemoor. Its neighbouring hundreds were Chewton to the north; Whitstone to the east; Glaston Twelve-hides to the south; and Bempstone and Winterstoke to the west.

The structures are considered architectural \\"follies\\". Origins They were constructed for an Anglo Irish Landlord, Arthur Keily-Ussher no later than 1834. He held an estate of approximately 8000 acres, the majority of which was rented to tenant farmers but he retained approximately 1000 acres as a personal demesne. The lodges were constructed on the main avenue leading to the family's residence; Ballysaggartmore House. The house itself was large but of a very plain design, which was in obvious contrast to the lodges. An account from 1834 indicates that a main house predated the lodges. This account also reports that they were built from designs by the head gardener; John Smyth and that the main entrance gates were forged locally for the sum of about ¬£150. Folklore and folly Local lore suggests that the grand entrance lodges were built as a prelude to an extravagant mansion that Keily-Ussher intended to build but never did as he ultimately ran out of funds due of their construction, and that his building pursuits were spurred on by his jealous wife who was envious of her sister in-law who lived at the stately Strancally Castle.Bence-Jones, Mark; Burke's Guide to Country Houses: Ireland. Volume 1 of Burke's and Savills Guide to Country Houses, Burke's Peerage, 1978. However no contemporary account exists from the period. Legacy Controversy surrounds Arthur Keily-Ussher. He has been accused of being a harsh landlord and evicting tenants who were unable to pay their rents during the Great Famine (1845-1849) and an attempt was made on his life during the period. Post Keily-Ussher Keily-Ussher died c.1862 and the estate was sold by a liquidator. The house, gardens and some of the lands were purchased by the Woodroofe family and these were later owned by a family named Anson. The house was destroyed by arson attack during the Civil War period and the ruined stone fabric was removed in the mid 20th century. One of the lodges was still in use as a private residence in the 1970s. Modern Era The lodges are un-roofed but extant and are surrounded by forested land. A walking trail encompassing them has been developed, a picnic and parking area is also provided as part of this public amenity.

The Foundation began in July 20, 2010 with the support of the National Hockey League (NHL)'s Pittsburgh Penguins ownership group. The Foundation offers preventive wellness and developmental programs, charity assist programs, promotes activity among youth and families while teaching life skills. Programs =HEADS UP Pittsburgh HEADS UP Pittsburgh= Created in 2011, HEADS UP Pittsburgh is an initiative started by the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation to provide educational training sessions and events to increase awareness toward the severity of concussions. The program educates parents and children about different concussion symptoms and what measures are necessary should an athlete sustain a possible concussion. HEADS UP Pittsburgh also stresses the importance of taking time to fully recover before returning to sports.http://pittsburghpenguinsfoundation.org/programs/headsup_brochure.html HEADS UP Pittsburgh is funded by the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation and implemented by UPMC Sports Medicine. The program initially offered free baseline concussion testing for youth hockey players in the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Hockey League (PIHL) and Pittsburgh Amateur Hockey League (PAHL), as well as other youth hockey groups registered locally through USA Hockey programs. In 2011, 2,300 youth hockey players were tested. The program expanded its second year to offer free baseline testing for athletes in 12 additional sports. To date, more than 5,700 young athletes have received free baseline concussion testing and educational seminars for their parents. The test, which all NHL players undergo, evaluates the athlete's neurocognitive state which includes brain processing speed, memory, and visual motor skills. If the player suffers a concussion, these test results are then used in order to compare their previous neurocognitive state to that of their possible concussed state. Baseline testing is used because concussions do not show up on CT or MRI scans due to it not being a structural brain injury. Testing is necessary because symptoms vary from person to person. These symptoms range from nausea, dizziness, concentration problems and/or fuzzy vision. The testing is done by the UPMC Sports Concussion group on the computer program ImPACT. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Community College of Allegheny County (CCAC) also play key roles in this unique program. = PensFIT = Implemented at the start of the 2012-13 school year, the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation developed PensFIT, a program designed to introduce children to the sport of hockey and facilitate an increase in physical activity. In 2012, the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation provided 260 elementary schools (public and private) in Allegheny County with free ball hockey equipment and lesson plans as part of their commitment to physical fitness. In addition to providing the equipment, the Pittsburgh Penguins, Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation, and California University of Pennsylvania devised a street hockey curriculum that is not only suitable for physical education classrooms, but also can be used in community recreation center programs. The PensFIT program provides teacher training, instruction and supplemental materials, and the opportunity for continuing education sessions featuring Pittsburgh Penguins coaching staff and alumni. PensFIT is funded entirely from proceeds from sales of the 2011 Civic Arena Roof ornament. It is a three-year initiative and within the next two years, the PensFIT program will move to counties outside Allegheny County. = Project Power Play = In an effort to combat the sedentary tendencies of America's youth, the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation created Project Power Play to promote fun, organized physical activity. Project Power Play is designed to take advantage of the growing popularity of hockey in the western Pennsylvania tri-state area by affording young players access to newly constructed, outdoor, multi-use athletic facilities. These structures provide safe areas to play games under the supervision of established organizations. In partnership with Highmark, the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation has constructed two new dek hockey rinks in the City of Pittsburgh; the first at Banksville Park and the second at Lewis Park in Hazelwood. The total project is estimated at $2.1 million and involves building 10 additional facilities over the next three years in Allegheny County and the surrounding communities. The selection of each dek hockey facility is carefully planned and takes into consideration need, utilization, supervision and location. The prime consideration for rink placements is whether a potential site is located within local city/county parks or adjacent to managed youth development facilities. The rink for each of the 12 facilities will feature a steel dasher board system, sports court and is enclosed by a cyclone fence. A Project Power Play start-up kit is provided and includes basic skills and game instructions, along with manuals. Planning and developing skill sessions, instructions and scrimmage games will be coordinated by Pittsburgh Penguins staff. The Penguins organization will also provide ongoing support for the facilities. = Learn To Play = Through the combined efforts of Sidney Crosby, the Pittsburgh Penguins, Penguins Foundation, Reebok and Dick's Sporting Goods, Sidney Crosby's Little Penguins Learn to Play Hockey program has introduced more than 4,200 Pittsburgh-area children to the game of hockey. The Learn to Play program was started in the 2008-09 hockey season with the goal to provide boys and girls, ages 4‚Äì8, with hockey equipment and instruction to foster a love of the sport and give children an opportunity to play. In the 2012-13 season, 1,000 children received free head-to-toe Reebok SC87 equipment, distributed by Dick's Sporting Goods, and the opportunity to learn at one of the 26 participating facilities, including four designed specifically for girls. = Hockey Is For Everyone = Fundraising efforts in 2011 enabled the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation to dramatically increase their grant assistance and support for Hockey is for Everyone initiatives. The Mighty Penguins, Steel City Icebergs and Pittsburgh I.C.E. each received grants through 2011 Civic Arena Roof ornament sales. = Mighty Penguins = Sled Hockey provides a means for physically challenged individuals to play competitive ice hockey. = Steel City Icebergs = An adaptive ice hockey program for both children and adults with developmental disabilities such as Autism, Down Syndrome and traumatic brain injury. = Pittsburgh I.C.E. (Inclusion Creates Equality) = Pittsburgh I.C.E. provides the opportunity to play ice hockey for children who might never have the opportunity to play or experience such a great game. = Explorers Series = In August 2012, the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation invited children and parents to explore the world through their Explorers Series. The CONSOL Energy Center was transformed into a classroom as 500 families learned through education films, demonstrations and hands-on activities. Children were encouraged to explore, experience, and learn about Robotics in an exciting venue. Future topics for the Explorers Series topics include Space Exploration and the Environment. Signature Events = Skates & Plates Charity Gala presented by Trib Total Media = Since 1986, the Penguins have hosted an annual charity gala for the benefit of local children's charities that focus on medical research. The events have raised over $5.75 million. In 2009, the Pittsburgh Penguins re-organized the team's gala and hosted its signature event, the Skates & Plates Charity Gala presented by Trib Total Media, to benefit the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation, Mario Lemieux Foundation and Western Pennsylvania Chapter of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Penguins players don tuxedos and pass plates instead of pucks as they greet guests and serve as waiters for the evening. Top tip honors and bragging rights are captured by a different Penguins' player each season. Along with dinner, the event features a unique silent auction. Prizes are also awarded to guests for the top tips (guests‚Äô tips are actually a donation to the event's selected charities) collected by the players. = Wine Tasting Gala presented by Highmark = The Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation annually hosts a Wine Tasting Gala and VIP Dinner at CONSOL Energy Center. The event benefits the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation and helps the Foundation continue its numerous efforts in the western Pennsylvania community. = Charity Auction on AT&T; SportsNet = The Penguins Foundation and Mario Lemieux Foundation teamed up for their second Charity Auction on ROOT Sports in March 2013. Fans attending the team's March 26 home game had an opportunity to purchase mystery bags full of Penguins memorabilia; each bag also included an autographed item from one of the players or Penguins alumni. For fans not in attendance, ROOT Sports dedicated their broadcast to the auction by promoting the sale of the bags online, along with a variety of exciting auction items that could be bid on through the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation website. All proceeds benefitted the Mario Lemieux Foundation for cancer research and neonatal research, as well as Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation youth charities. = Hockey Fights Cancer = Hockey Fights Cancer is an initiative founded in December 1998 by the National Hockey League and the National Hockey League Players' Association to raise money and awareness for hockey's most important fight. To date, through the NHL's US and Canadian charitable foundations, more than $12.8 million has been raised under the Hockey Fights Cancer initiative to support national and local cancer research institutions, children's hospitals, player charities and local cancer organizations. The Hockey Fights Cancer program is also a component of the NHL's \\"Biggest Assist Happens Off the Ice\\" campaign - the League's long- standing tradition of addressing important social issues in North America and around the world. The Hockey Fights Cancer program is supported by each NHL Member Club, players, NHL Alumni, the NHL Officials' Association, Professional Hockey Trainers and Equipment Managers, corporate marketing partners, broadcast partners and fans throughout North America. = Open Practice = Since 2010, the Pittsburgh Penguins and Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation have hosted an Open Hockey Practice for students at CONSOL Energy Center. The event offers a rare opportunity for more than 10,000 children, in grades one through eight, from across Allegheny County to see the Penguins at work. Students are entertained leading up to the start of practice with informational videos about behind-the-scenes aspects of the team and facility. Students are given the opportunity to ask questions of the players and coaches during and after practice. The Open Practice incorporates educational themes (math, geography, etc.) and each student is given an activity book focused on education, health and nutrition to take home. = Summer Sticks presented by UPMC = Every autumn, the Pittsburgh Penguins host a golf tournament and spend a day on the links for charity. The scramble style tournament features teams of three, each accompanied by a Penguins‚Äô celebrity captain; competing for tournament prizes. Proceeds from this event benefit the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation. Fundraising = Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation 50/50 RAFFLE = After the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania passed a measure legalizing 50/50 drawings in 2013, the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation began hosting a 50/50 RAFFLE to help local charities raise funds. The Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation hosts a 50/50 RAFFLE at all Pittsburgh Penguins home games and one participating fan wins 50% of the collected amount at each game. For the balance, a majority of the remaining amount is directed to that game's selected Charity with the remainder will be distributed by the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation to a local 501c3 charity. A different charity is selected to participate at each game.

The monument is attached to a pillar in a nave of the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome. Maria Raggi Maria Raggi (1552‚Äì1600) was a nun from the island of Chios. Forced to marry at an early age, she was widowed when her husband was captured by Turkish forces in 1570. She became a nun in 1571, and departed for Rome in 1584, where she was resident at the Palazzo of the de Marini family, near Santa Maria sopra Minerva. An extremely pious woman, she spent much of her day in prayer, and reportedly continually performed miracles. After dying in 1600, there was some possibility of her being canonised, but the general antipathy of Pope Urban VIII to such events meant the opportunity passed. Patronage Three descendants of Maria were responsible for commissioning Bernini to create the work, Ottaviano, Tommaso, and Lorenzo Raggi, whose names are noted in the Latin inscriptions in the bottom half of the memorial.

Approximately 100 people were killed in the fire and at least 116 others were hospitalized with varying degrees of burns. The incident was not the first such pipeline accident in Kenya, with the Molo fire of 2009 resulting in at least 133 fatalities and hundreds more injured. Causes A fuel tank, located in the industrial Lunga Lunga area of Nairobi and part of a pipeline system operated by the state owned Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC), had sprung a leak. People in the adjacent densely populated shanty town of Sinai had started to collect leaking fuel when at about 10 a.m. a massive explosion occurred at the scene. Fire spread to the Sinai area. The cause of the explosion has not yet been determined but some reports indicate that the fire might have started from a discarded cigarette or when the wind changed, bringing embers from nearby garbage fires. Energy Minister Kiraitu Murungi is reported as saying that the disaster began when a pipeline valve failed under pressure allowing the oil to leak into the sewer. Selest Kilinda, the managing director of KPC, is reported to have said the spill occurred from two pipelines, and that engineers had already depressurised the Sinai pipeline but not in time to prevent fuel leaking into the sewer. Casualties Early police estimates have the number of fatalities to be above one hundred; in addition, at least 116 other people were hospitalized with burn injuries. The exact death toll remains uncertain due to some bodies being badly charred or lost in the murky waters of a nearby river. Kenya's Red Cross Disaster Risk Reduction Officer said that the Red Cross would counsel the victims and also would attempt to reconcile the casualty figures with those reported missing. He also reported that most bodies taken to the mortuary were burnt beyond recognition and would require DNA tests to confirm their identities. In November 2011, The Kenya Pipeline Company funded the delivery to the Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation a computer and software system to facilitate forensic DNA identification of victims. The system, called M-FISys (pronounced like \\"emphasis,\\" an acronym for the Mass-Fatality Identification System), was developed to identify victims of the World Trade Center Disaster of September 11, 2001. City hospitals were hard pressed by the surge of the need for care provisions, food and a strained medicare staff complement. The Kenyatta National Hospital has only 22 burn unit beds and considers any more than 60 casualties as a 'disaster', requiring them to put disaster plans into action. At least 112 people were admitted with burns, many critical or severe. The long-term treatment required for burns patients means that extra tents have been erected for blood donations. The nearer Mater Hospital admitted three casualties with less than 30% burns into the normal ward and one other casualty with 80‚Äì90% burns into the intensive care unit. Responsibility Neither the managing director of the KPC, which operates the pipeline, nor the energy minister Kiraitu Murungi have given any indication of accepting responsibility. Kiraitu Murungi initially said that the KPC would compensate the victims, but later the KPC stated it would not do so as it was \\"not responsible\\". In 2008 the KPC had issued an eviction order to nearby residents, but they refused to leave. In response to protests by students, an inter-ministerial committee was tasked with gathering names to arrange relocation when funds became available. KPC sent representatives to inform the residents of the danger and to make sure holes were not dug. Political impact Prime minister Raila Odinga and vice- president Kalonzo Musyoka have visited the scene and various hospitals to console injured victims and to condole bereaved families. President Mwai Kibaki visited the main Kenyatta National Hospital to empathize with the injured. The secretary-general of the United Nations, Ban Ki Moon, expressed sorrow and sympathy for the victims, wishing a full and speedy recovery to the survivors, while the United States ambassador to Kenya, Scott Gration, lauded the rescue workers and the personal heroism of the locals. Amnesty International-Kenya said that the failure to relocate people puts the majority of the blame on government officials. Enforcement after the event The National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) said it will act against the KPC for failing to enforce EMCA 1999‚Äîand suggests that if the required spill containment measures were in place at the facility the oil would not have run off into the drains. NEMA dismissed KPC claims that they had acted sufficiently, saying they had not received the Environmental audit that is obligatory under the 2003 Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental Audit Regulations. The slum has been in that place for approximately 20 years despite the requirement for KPC to keep those areas clear of settlement. NEMA said it would also require KPC to deal with the pollution in the environment, particularly regarding the flora and fauna along the Ngong River into which the storm drain flows. Warnings before the event In 2009 journalist John Ngirachu wrote for the local newspaper Daily Nation and reported that the slums in Sinai being located so near to the pipeline were a disaster waiting to happen. The permanent secretary to the Ministry of Energy, Patrick Nyoike, had asked the KPC to refurbish the pipelines but it was reported that the Ministry of Finance declined.

English Baronies: A Study of their Origin and Descent 1086-1327, Oxford, 1960, pp.75-6 Career Walter's elder brother William died before Michaelmas 1211, leaving Walter as his heir, then aged 19. In 1212, still not having reached the age of mojority (i.e. 21), he was married to Johanna Mortimer (d.1225), his warder's daughter. He was in possession of his barony by 1214. He obtained his father's hereditary office of Sheriff of Worcestershire on 19 August 1215, but lost it in May 1216 when, with nineteen of his knights, he deserted to the rebels. He returned to his allegiance to King John in August 1216, and was reinstated in his lands. Walter was a witness at the re-issue of Magna Carta on 11 November 1216 and in March 1217 he was restored by King Henry III to his shrievalty and castellanship, and became Keeper of the Royal Forests in Worcestershire. He witnessed the further re-issue of Magna Carta on 11 February 1225. Marriages and children He married twice: *Firstly, in 1212 at the age of 20, to Johanna Mortimer (d.1225), daughter of his warder Roger Mortimer (d. 1214) of Wigmore Castle, by whom he had issue including: **William (III) de Beauchamp (1215-1269), eldest son and heir, who married Isabel de Mauduit, sister and heiress of William Mauduit, 8th Earl of Warwick, by whom he was the father of William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick. *Secondly, in 1225 or later, he married a certain Angaret (d.1280/3), of unrecorded family.

To have them display the same time it would be necessary to re- synchronize them at regular intervals. The period between synchronizations is referred to as holdover and performance under holdover relies on the quality of the reference oscillator, the PLL design, and the correction mechanisms employed. Importance The quote above suggests that one can think of holdover in synchronization applications as analogous to running on backup power. Modern wireless communication systems require at least knowledge of frequency and often knowledge of phase as well in order to work correctly. Base stations need to know what time it is, and they usually get this knowledge from the outside world somehow (from a GPS Time and Frequency receiver, or from a synchronization source somewhere in the network they are connected to). But if the connection to the reference is lost then the base station will be on its own to establish what time it is. The base station needs a way to establish accurate frequency and phase (to know what time it is) using internal (or local) resources, and that‚Äôs where the function of holdover becomes important. The importance of GPS-derived timing A key application for GPS in telecommunications is to provide synchronization in wireless basestations. Base stations depend on timing to operate correctly, particularly for the handoff that occurs when a user moves from one cell to another. In these applications holdover is used in base stations to ensure continued operation while GPS is unavailable and to reduce the costs associated with emergency repairs, since holdover allows the site to continue to function correctly until maintenance can be performed at a convenient time. Some of the most stringent requirements come from the newer generation of wireless base stations, where phase accuracy targets as low as 1Œºs need to be maintained for correct operation. However the need for accurate timing has been an integral part of the history of wireless communication systems as well as wireline, and it has been suggested that the search for reliable and cost effective timing solutions was spurred on by the need for CDMA to compete with lower cost solutions. Within the base station, besides standard functions, accurate timing and the means to maintain it through holdover is vitally important for services such as E911 GPS as a source of timing is a key component in not just Synchronization in telecommunications but to critical infrastructure in general. Of the 18 Critical Resource and Key infrastructure (CIKR)sectors, 15 use GPS derived timing to function correctly. One notable application where highly accurate timing accuracy (and the means to maintain it through holdover) is of importance is in the use of Synchrophasors in the power industry to detect line faults. Another is in Low latency trading applications in capital markets. How GPS-derived timing can fail GPS is sensitive to jamming and interference because the signal levels are so low and can easily be swamped by other sources, that can be accidental or deliberate. Also since GPS depends on line of sight signals it can be disrupted by Urban canyon effects, making GPS only available to some locations at certain times of the day, for example. A GPS outage however is not initially an issue because clocks can go into holdover, allowing the interference to be alleviated as much as the stability of the oscillator providing holdover will allow. The more stable the oscillator, the longer the system can operate without GPS. Defining holdover In Synchronization in telecommunications applications holdover is defined by ETSI as: > An operating condition of a clock which has lost its controlling input and > is using stored data, acquired while in locked operation, to control its > output. The stored data are used to control phase and frequency variations, > allowing the locked condition to be reproduced within specifications. > Holdover begins when the clock output no longer reflects the influence of a > connected external reference, or transition from it. Holdover terminates > when the output of the clock reverts to locked mode condition. One can regard holdover then as a measure of accuracy or error acquired by a clock when there is no controlling external reference to correct for any errors. MIL-PRF-55310 defines Clock Accuracy as: T(t) = T_0 + \\\\int_0^t R(t)\\\\,dt\\\\ + \\\\epsilon(t) = T_0+(R_0t + \\\\frac{1}{2}At^2+...) + \\\\int_0^t E_t(t)\\\\, dt + \\\\epsilon(t) Where T_0 is the synchronization error at t = 0; R(t) is the fractional frequency difference between two clocks under comparison; \\\\epsilon(t) is the error due to random noise; R_0 is R(t) at t=0; A is the linear aging rate and E_1(t) is the frequency difference due to environmental effects. Similarly ITU G.810 defines Time Error as: x(t) = x_0 + y_0t + \\\\frac{D}{2}t^2 + \\\\frac{\\\\phi(t)}{2\\\\pi u_{nom}} Where x(t) is the time error; x_0 is the time error at t=0; y_0 is the fractional frequency error at t=0; D is the linear fractional frequency drift rate; \\\\phi(t) is the random phase deviation component and u_{nom} is the nominal frequency. Implementing holdover In applications that require synchronization (such as wireless base stations) GPS Clocks are often used and in this context are often known as a GPSDO (GPS Disciplined Oscillator) or GPS TFS (GPS Time and Frequency Source). NIST defines a Disciplined Oscillator as: > An oscillator whose output frequency is continuously steered (often through > the use of a phase locked loop) to agree with an external reference. For > example, a GPS disciplined oscillator (GPSDO) usually consists of a quartz > or rubidium oscillator whose output frequency is continuously steered to > agree with signals broadcast by the GPS satellites. In a GPSDO a GPS or GNSS signal is used as the external reference that steers an internal oscillator. In a modern GPSDO the GPS processing and steering function are both implemented in a Microprocessor allowing a direct comparison between the GPS reference signal and the oscillator output. A Modern GPSDO Amongst the building blocks of a GPS Time and Frequency solution the oscillator is a key component and typically they are built around an Oven Controlled Crystal Oscillator (OCXO) or a Rubidium based clock. The dominant factors influencing the quality of the reference oscillator are taken to be aging and temperature stability. However, depending upon the construction of the oscillator, barometric pressure and relative humidity can have at least as strong an influence on the stability of the quartz oscillator. What is often referred to as \\"random walk\\" instability is actually a deterministic effect of environmental parameters. These can be measured and modeled to vastly improve the performance of quartz oscillators. An addition of a Microprocessor to the reference oscillator can improve temperature stability and aging performance During Holdover any remaining clock error caused by aging and temperature instability can be corrected by control mechanisms. A combination of quartz based reference oscillator (such as an OCXO) and modern correction algorithms can get good results in Holdover applications. The holdover capability then is provided either by a free running local oscillator, or a local oscillator that is steered with software that retains knowledge of its past performance. The earliest documentation of such an effort comes from the then National Bureau of Standards in 1968 [Allan, Fey, Machlan and Barnes, \\"An Ultra Precise Time Synchronization System Designed By Computer Simulation\\", Frequency], where an analog computer consisting of ball-disk integrators implemented a third order control loop to correct for the frequency ageing of an oscillator. The first microprocessor implementation of this concept occurred in 1983 [Bourke, Penrod, \\"An Analysis of a Microprocessor Controlled Disciplined Frequency Standard\\", Frequency Control Symposium] where Loran-C broadcasts were used to discipline very high quality quartz oscillators as a caesium replacement in telecommunications wireline network synchronization. The basic aim of a steering mechanism is to improve the stability of a clock or oscillator while minimizing the number of times it needs calibration. In Holdover the learned behaviour of the OCXO is used to anticipate and correct for future behavior. Effective aging and temperature compensation can be provided by such a mechanism and the system designer is faced with a range of choices for algorithms and techniques to do this correction including extrapolation, interpolation and predictive filters (including Kalman filters). Once the barriers of aging and environmental effects are removed the only theoretical limitation to holdover performance in such a GPSDO is irregularity or noise in the drift rate, which is quantified using a metric like Allan deviation or Time deviation.http://www.leapsecond.com/pages/adev/adev-why.htm The complexity in trying to predict the effects on Holdover due to systematic effects like aging and temperature stability and stochastic influences like Random Walk noise has resulted in tailor-made Holdover Oscillator solutions being introduced in the market.

He served in both houses of the Texas State Legislature, on the Fort Worth City Council, and as mayor of Fort Worth. Parmer also served as Assistant Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development and Chief of the Humanitarian Response Bureau under the Agency where he was responsible for emergency U. S. response to over 80 declared disasters both natural and man-made around the world. He followed that with seven years as president and CEO of the American Refugee Committee, a U. S. based humanitarian relief organization with 2000 employees in 14 disaster and conflict impacted nations around the world. Early years In 1957, Parmer graduated from Polytechnic High School in Fort Worth. In 2009, he was inducted into \\"Wall of Fame\\" by the Fort Worth Independent School District, the governing board of Fort Worth public schools. Parmer earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut and a master's degree in Political Science from University of Texas at Arlington in Arlington, Texas. He headed the Parmer Marketing Company, Inc., from 1969 to 1988. Political career At the age of twenty-three, Parmer served as the youngest legislator in the Texas House of Representatives for a single term from 1963 to 1965. Thereafter, he was elected to the Fort Worth City Council in 1975 and became mayor of Fort Worth in 1977, a post he held for two years until his defeat in 1979 in a heated contest with Woodie Woods. Parmer was then elected as a state senator in 1982, where he defeated Andy Andujar, the husband of State Senator Betty Andujar, the first Republican woman to serve in the state Senate. Parmer served on the Senate committees of (1) State Affairs, (2) Health and Human Resources, (3) Chairman of Intergovernmental Relations, (4) Chaired the Special Senate Committee on Hunger in Texas in 1985, and (5) Chair of Democratic Caucus of Senate in 1987. In 1989, Parmer was one of five senators to serve as the President Pro Tempore, having preceded in that position his regional colleague, Bob McFarland of Arlington.List of Presidents pro tempore of the Texas Senate In 1988, at the age of forty-nine, Parmer was admitted to the practice of law in Texas. He took and passed the State Bar Exam without attending law school under an old state law permitting the substitution of years of legislative service for law school hours. From 1991 to 1998, Parmer was the managing shareholder of the law firm Parmer, Archer, Young and Steen. Parmer ran two unsuccessful campaigns for the United States House of Representatives and one for the United States Senate. In 1984, as a freshman state senator, he lost the Democratic nomination in District 6 to former State Representative Dan Kubiak of Rockdale. Kubiak was then defeated by Republican Joe Barton, who held the seat until 2019. Barton succeeded the Democrat- turned-Republican Phil Gramm, who was first elected to the U.S. Senate that year over fellow Republicans Ron Paul and Henry C. Grover and the Democratic State Senator Lloyd Doggett of Austin. In the U.S. Senate race in 1990, Parmer polled 1,429,986 votes (37.4 percent), but Gramm prevailed, 2,302,357 (60.2 percent). In 1996, as the Democratic nominee in District 12, Parmer polled 41 percent of the vote against the Republican Kay Granger, also a former mayor of Fort Worth.  Humanitarian career  In 1998 Parmer was appointed by U.S.President Bill Clinton as the Assistant Administrator of the U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in charge of the Bureau of Humanitarian Response. Parmer was unanimously confirmed for the post by the Republican controlled U. S. Senate. During his tenure at USAID, Parmer was largely responsible for U.S. humanitarian operations during the Kosovo War. After the election of President George W. Bush in 2000, Parmer was selected as president of the American Refugee Committee, an international humanitarian relief organization with programs in 14 conflict impacted countries around the world. In 2008, he was elected to the board of directors of Interaction, the largest association of U.S. based private relief and development organizations. Recent activities In 2008, Parmer was named a research fellow at the Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs, formerly the Humphrey Institute, named for former Vice President of the United States Hubert H. Humphrey, and located at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he explored issues relating to disaster relief. In 2010, Parmer's political involvement included donations to defeated U.S. Representatives Chet Edwards of Texas, another former political rival of Phil Gramm's, and Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota. In 2008, he contributed to then U.S. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Before his death, Parmer was an adjunct professor at the University of North Texas in Denton, Texas, Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, and Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas. He taught senior undergraduate and graduate seminars in International Aid, Humanitarian Intervention and Refugee Affairs. Parmer died in Fort Worth on May 27, 2020.

It is also known as A Wind Story. It stars Ivens as he travels in China and tries to capture winds on film, while he reflects on his life and career. The film blends real and fictional elements; it ranges from documentary footage to fantastical dream sequences and Peking opera. It was Ivens' last film. Synopsis Next to a fast-spinning windmill, a young boy enters a large toy aeroplane and says he will fly to China. An old man, Joris Ivens, sits on a chair in the Gobi Desert. On the sand dunes around him a group of men are raising poles with microphones. An old Chinese man practices martial arts with several younger men in front of a traditional Chinese building. Ivens, who is 90 years old, has been asthmatic since childhood, and asks the man how he manages to breathe so well. The literary character Sun Wukong, in a Peking opera appearance, watches from a tree. The man answers that \\"the secret of breathing lies in the rhythm of the autumn wind\\". The man begins to dance. Sun Wukong then throws a banana peel before the man, who slips and falls. Ivens helps him up. Ivens visits the Golden Thousand Armed Guanyin at the Dazu Rock Carvings. Intercut are Chinese landscapes seen from the air and footage of stormy weather. The Leshan Giant Buddha is seen. In the Gobi Desert, the team of technicians set up a camp. Ivens uses an inhaler and is swiftly examined by a doctor. A member of the group says that the wind will not appear for several days. The following day, Ivens falls from his chair in the desert and is brought to a hospital. Sun Wukong visits him in the hospital bed. In an extended dream sequence, the spaceship from the film A Trip to the Moon brings Ivens to the Moon. There he encounters the goddess Chang'e who tells him there is no wind on the Moon. Ivens finds that remarkable. In a stylised village where a wedding is taking place, a communist representative holds a speech about how fortunate the villagers are. Sun Wukong turns up and pulls the plug to the representative's microphone, and makes the loudspeakers play Western pop music instead. Ivens is briefly seen in Sun Wukong's make-up. Ivens enters a cavern, where men greet him and say that he is expected. At the end of the cavern there is a mask from which a strong wind blows from the mouth. Ivens says that he wants to meet the man who made the mask, which is arranged. The man explains the mask's mythological symbology and gives it to Ivens, who in return gives the man a print of his 1930 film Breakers. Ivens is carried to the top of a mountain to record the sound of wind. Footage is seen from the Japanese invasion of China, which Ivens filmed in 1938. Footage from the air is seen of the Great Wall of China, partially covered in desert sand. Trying to film the Terracotta Army, Ivens and Marceline Loridan only obtain permission to film for ten minutes, which would not be enough. Ivens therefore buys a large number of replicas from local tourist shops to create his own army, which he arranges and films, together with choreographed men dressed up in terracotta warrior costumes. At Ivens' camp in the Gobi Desert, an old woman approaches and says she can summon the wind by drawing a magic figure. To do this she demands two mechanical fans, which Ivens agrees to give her. Ivens explains how he for his entire career has tried to tame the wind by capturing it with the camera. The woman draws in the sand, and heavy wind begins to blow in the previously calm desert. Release The film premiered on 9 September 1988 at the 45th Venice Film Festival. It was released in France through MK2 Diffusion on 15 March 1989. A French DVD was released on 11 March 2009. =Critical response= In The New York Times, Caryn James wrote: \\"Shot between 1984 and 1988, the film is dominated by the presence of Ivens, then in his late 80's. ... A Tale of the Wind, with its scenes of dreams, dramatized myths and real life, suggests the way this old man's creativity is bound to the natural landscapes, cultural images and personal memories that flow through the film.\\" Trying to define the film, James wrote: \\"At a press conference the other day, Miss Loridan said that she and Ivens were working in a 'no man's land between Lumiere and Melies', between the two great early film makers who defined realism and fantasy. There is no better description of the place they map out beautifully in A Tale of the Wind. Its elliptical narrative will not appeal to every taste, but this is an eloquent last word from an important artist.\\" =Accolades= The film won the Special Award at the 1989 S√£o Paulo International Film Festival.

He was also a vizier. Background Musa Pasha was born into a Bosniak family and attended the Enderun palace school. As governor of Egypt Musa Pasha's term as the governor of Egypt was described as brutal and terror-inducing by multiple sources.d'Avennes, Prisse (1983) Arab art as seen through the monuments of Cairo from the 7th century to the 18th (translated from French by J.I. Erythrospis) Le Sycomore, Paris, page 61, On the first day of holding divan (government), he had a man's head struck off and his property confiscated, following this with the crucifixion of the son of a local sharif chief. After handing out the various government offices to his friends and servants and facing the displeasure of the sanjak-beys, Mustafa Pasha returned the offices to their previous owners and blamed the incident on an agha, confiscating his residence as ostensible punishment. During his governorship, Musa Pasha took on projects and plans to reform the salary system to his benefit and find methods to claim wealthy locals' inheritances. =Murder of Kitas Bey= In March 1631, sultan Murad IV ordered Musa Pasha to send him troops for the expedition against Persia. Musa Pasha gave command of these troops to emir Kitas Bey, who was of Circassian origins, and imposed a tax on the land in order to pay for the camels to transport the troops to Persia. Musa Pasha then told Kitas Bey that funds were insufficient for the expedition and that it was canceled. When Kitas Bey protested, Musa Pasha had him killed; on Wednesday, July 9, 1631, the Day of Arafa and the day before Eid al-Adha, a day when the emirs traditionally visited the governor's house to wish him well, Kitas Bey was in attendance despite having second thoughts because of his knowledge of his now-poor standing with the Pasha. Suddenly, Musa Pasha had a group of men spring upon Kitas Bey, one man decapitating him with a single swing of an axe, while up to 40 others stabbed his body as the other emirs stood by in horror. =Aftermath= After the sanjak-beys led by Kasƒ±m Bey held a funeral for Kitas Bey, they declared to the entire Egypt garrison that whoever would be present at Musa Pasha's Eid feast that day would be punished by death. Meanwhile, Musa Pasha waited for the guests to arrive, but when none did, he walked to the Al-Nasir Muhammad Mosque and prayed the Eid prayers, after which he sat down with the members of his household at the feast, distributing the rest amongst the poor of Cairo. The leaders of the troops met at Kasƒ±m Bey's house and went to a local kazasker (high judge), employing him as their representative to go to Musa Pasha. The representative asked Musa Pasha on behalf of the troops why he had committed a murder on such a holy day, if there were any orders from the sultan from Constantinople, and to give up the men who had murdered Kitas Bey to the troops. Musa Pasha answered that he had done nothing outside the orders of the sultan but neither could he consent to any of the troops' demands. Although this response garnered displeasure from the troops, they left without taking any action. The troops then caught up with four of Musa Pasha's trusted men, killed them, and dispersed. Two days later, now Friday, July 11, 1631, the troops reassembled with all the sanjak-beys, the leading officers meeting in the Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan. They met with the same kazasker as before, the naqib al-ashraf (head of the ashraf), and the mufti of the mosque. These representatives were once again sent to Musa Pasha, with the same list of demands, this time also naming eight of the assassins by name and demanding them to be turned over to the troops. Musa Pasha replied that responsibility was solely his, and that the men were only following his orders, offering to give himself up and allow the soldiers to nominate a kaymakam (acting governor) in his place. Although the troop leadership was divided on what action to take, with some factions claiming that they did not have the authority to replace the governor while others wishing to simply murder Musa Pasha and kidnap the eight men. =Removal from office= Eventually, the troops came to a consensus and chose to elect an acting governor, the elderly finance minister Hasan Bey. Musa Pasha immediately wrote to sultan Murad IV to inform him of the effective coup, and the troops did the same, choosing to send a petition of their grievances and justifications for their actions; the soldiers wrote in Turkish while the ulemas sent an Arabic version. Hasan Bey and the emirs demanded a large sum of money from Musa Pasha as restitution for the money he owed to the treasury, to pay for which he sold much of his animals and belongings. The sultan replied by agreeing with the troops' decision, sending Halil Pasha to take Musa Pasha's place as governor. On September 13, 1631, Halil Pasha's advisor arrived, while Hasan Bey continued to serve as acting governor until October, when Halil Pasha finally arrived. Death Only two years after his appointment as Kapudan Pasha (grand admiral) of the Ottoman Navy, Musa Pasha died in battle with a Venetian fleet near the Greek island of Euboea in 1645 during the Cretan War (1645‚Äì69) (also known as the War of Candia or the Fifth Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War). His body was brought to the √úsk√ºdar district of Istanbul and buried there.

Peer Instruction: A User's Manual Series in Educational Innovation. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ Originally used in many schools, including introductory undergraduate physics classes at Harvard University, peer instruction is used in various disciplines and institutions around the globe. It is a student-centered approach that involves flipping the traditional classroom by moving information transfer out and moving information assimilation, or application of learning, into the classroom. There is some research that supports the effectiveness of peer instruction over more traditional teaching methods, such as pure lecture.C. Crouch & E. Mazur (2001). Peer Instruction: Ten Years of Experience and Results, Am. J. Phys., v69, 970-977 Peer instruction as a learning system involves students preparing to learn outside of class by doing pre-class readings and answering questions about those readings using another method, called Just in Time Teaching.G. Novak et al., (1999). Just-in-Time teaching: Blending Active Learning with Web Technology. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ Then, in class, the instructor engages students by posing prepared conceptual questions or ConcepTests that are based on student difficulties. The questioning procedure outlined by Eric Mazur is as follows: # Instructor poses question based on students' responses to their pre-class reading # Students reflect on the question # Students commit to an individual answer # Instructor reviews student responses # Students discuss their thinking and answers with their peers # Students then commit again to an individual answer # The instructor again reviews responses and decides whether more explanation is needed before moving on to the next concept.

Products  NetLogic‚Äôs product portfolio included knowledge-based processors, multi-core processors, content processors, network search engines, high-speed 10 and 40 Gigabit Ethernet PHYs, wireless base station digital front-end PHYs and low-power embedded processors. Its global customer base included Alcatel- Lucent, Cisco Systems, Dell, Ericsson, Google, Hewlett-Packard, Huawei Technologies, Juniper Networks and Nokia-Siemens.  History It was in October 2007 that NetLogic Microsystems, Inc. signed a definitive agreement to acquire the privately held Aeluros, Inc., which created interface technologies and semiconductor products. In December 2010 NetLogic began using an implementation system developed by Magma Design Automation Inc, which created chip design software. In 2011, NetLogic acquired Optichron for $22 million. From its IPO in 2004 through 2011, NetLogic grew at an annual rate of 39%, which was four to five times the average growth rate of semiconductor companies during that period. The company also enjoyed healthy profits, with gross profits in excess of 70% and net income in excess of 25% in 2011. NetLogic was one of the semiconductor industry's most innovative companies, having been granted more than 800 patents. The Global Semiconductor Alliance named NetLogic the Most Respected Emerging Public Semiconductor Company for three consecutive years, from 2009 to 2011. On September 12, 2011, Broadcom Corporation agreed to buy NetLogic for $3.7 billion in cash. It was a 57% premium to NetLogic's closing price on September 9, 2011. NetLogic shareholders received $50 a share. It was Broadcom‚Äôs largest acquisition and its first acquisition of a publicly-traded company. The acquisition closed in February 2012. According to the publication SlashGear, Broadcom hoped to boost its chipset division with the acquisition of NetLogic. NetLogic was headquartered in Santa Clara, California, hired approximately 800 employees worldwide, and reported revenue of $405.4 million for its fiscal year 2012, its last fiscal year as a standalone company.

Gatluak was of Nuer origin, from Koch County. He was a relatively junior SPLA officer on the payroll of the Unity state prisons department. He was said to have wanted to become the Koch county commissioner, but lost this opportunity when Taban Deng Gai was appointed governor of Unity state in 2008. In the April 2010 general elections, Taban Deng Gai successfully defended his governorship against challenger Angelina Teny, wife of South Sudan vice president Riek Machar. Gatluak Gai did not accept the election results, which were widely seen as flawed. Although Angelina Teny disputed the election results, she disclaimed any connection with Gatluak Gai's rebellion. In late May 2010, Gatluak Gai's forces attacked an SPLA base at Awarping in Abiemnom County. It was suspected that Gatluak Gai led the forces responsible for attacks that killed over 35 people, including many civilians, in Koch County. Gai was residing in Khartoum at this time. There were conflicting rumors about the sources of Gai's forces and arms. As of January 2011 talks were in progress with different people who claimed to represent Gai, but the situation was extremely obscure. Gai signed a peace agreement with the SPLA on 20 July 2011. He would have rejoined the SPLA as a lieutenant general. Three days later he was shot to death in Koch county. At first the SPLA was blamed for the death. However, on 24 July, Marko Chuol Ruei, second in command of the rebel South Sudan Liberation Army (SSLA), said he had killed Gai. Ruei claimed that Gai had told his forces to ignore the peace agreement, to not join the SPLA but instead to join forces from North Sudan. Ruei said the SSLA had been negotiating with Khartoum for supply of munitions, but had been told they would first have to join the rebel militias led by Peter Gadet and Bapiny Monytuel. At the time of his death, Gatluak Gai was in his 50s. He had an imposing, physical presence. Another rebel leader, General Peter Gadet, was married to one of Gai's daughters.

The lake is composed of an eastern and western basin, separated by a peninsula entering the lake from north to south. The lake is managed by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission and operates a public boat launch located along the southeast corner of the lake. Motorized boats are permitted on the Lake, but are required to navigate counter- clockwise. The Scranton Canoe Club is located on Point Road (peninsula) offering club members a nine-hole golf course and lakeside dining. Geography Lake Winola covers with an average depth of and a maximum depth of in the center of the western cove. The lake bottom is steeply sloped moving from the shoreline to the open waters and composed of an average of sediment. The thickest amount of sediment () has been deposited in the southeastern section of the lake. The lake bottom also yields eight different types of aquatic vegetation. The dominant species is the Broad-leaved Pondweed while two invasive exotic plant species, the Eurasian Watermilfoil and Curly-leaf Pondweed, are also present. History The Scranton, Montrose and Binghamton Railroad, also known as the Northern Electric trolley line, built a branchline from Factoryville to Lake Winola which opened in May, 1908. Following this, Northern Electric purchased of lakefront property on which a dance pavilion and a small amusement park were built. Summer visitors and residents could also take boat rides on the lake, operated by a small steamboat. Costing just 45 cents one way from the city of Scranton to the lake. This solidified the lake as a popular destination for local residents in the summers for many years. The trolley line operated until the fall of 1930, when it was replaced with bus service which was operated by the Northern Electric since 1927.Flanagan, Thomas F. Northern Electric Railway.

He remained in service for the longest period of 24 years between 1722 and 1746, especially during the early period of Joseph Fran√ßois Dupleix. He was succeeded by Ananda Ranga Pillai. Everything known about his life comes from the private diary of Ananda Ranga Pillai and the inscriptions found in the walls of St. Andrews church, which he built in the memory of his dead son. In the diary, he is portrayed as being jealous and the chief rival of Ranga Pillai. Thus, the accuracy of the description is questionable. As a broker, his roles were to act as an intermediary, supervising the manufacture of clothes, warehousing, and export of merchandise. Although the role of the broker was not to supply the French company with manufactured goods, he did so. He was a great merchant. Early life Nothing is known about the early life of Pedro Kanagaraya Mudaliar. All converted Christians were poor except the family of Kanagaraya Mudaliar and his brothers. It was only of late years that a few had been able to keep themselves in comfort as Europeans' dubashes or in other employment.ECONOMIC CHANGES AND URBANIZATION. 1673-1761, His grandfather Thanappa Mudaliar was the first chief dubash of the French East India Company. Thanappa played an important role in creating and instituting the French colony in Pondicherry. Thanappa Mudaliar, a native of Poonamallee, embraced Christianity with his son on 20 March 1671 and took the name Lazaro de Mota. He did business in rice with French starting from 1672. The French kept him as their consultant in trade and commerce. It was by his suggestion that the French officials reached Pondicherry by sea on 15 January 1674 with 150 migrants. Thanappa Mudaliar was appointed as the chief agent of the East India Company in 1674. He was appointed as the head of the Tamil merchants in 1686. He was thus given the full control over the entire business of the company with the native merchants. He was the one to fix the prices of all commodities made available to the French in Pondicherry. Thanappa Mudaliar invited weavers from neighboring places and made them settle down in areas with a view to procuring sufficient volumes of textiles for export. He got constructed storehouses for the commodities so textiles, saltpeter, camphor, ivory, precious stones, and spices from other regions were brought to Pondicherry for export to France. His son Andre Muthappa Mudaliar discharged the duties of the courtier from 1699 on ward. On his demise Nainiappa was asked to take charge in 1708. He held an important position in French Pondicherry. As a dubash After Nainiappa, Perdo Kanakaraya Mudaliar, the grandson of Thanappa Mudaliar entered the service of the French Company as courier between 1716 and 1743. It seems that he got the position because the Chief Ecclesiastes of the Colony strongly desired that the holders of the office needed to be a Christian. He supplied commodities to the French. He used to get the Indian merchants contracts for the supply of commodities. In 1739 when the French were in financial difficulties, he advanced money to them even without interest thus gaining their trust. He engaged himself in the supply of cloth to the French for export in 1743. =Selling his ship= It is recorded by Ananda Ranga Pillai that Kanakaraya Mudaliar sold his ship. The sale of the ship was documented in the presence of the notary. Kanakaraya Mudaliar seems to be the first Tamil, who owned a ship during the French rule in India. A certificate of sale of The Soucourarna was issued in June 1730. The sale was made for the value of 2800 pagodas. Dupleix remitted the amount to him in the form of cargo of gold of the voyage to Bengal and Surat. Death of his son On 22 October 1739, his only son Velavendra Mudali (birth: 12 September 1718) died at age of 21. Even though the circumstances and the cause of death are not recorded, Ananda Ranga pillai being a well versed astrologist, suggests in his diary that this is due to a bad turn in Kanagaraya Mudaliyar's astrology. He also records that Velavendra was buried the next day at 3:00 PM with silk attire and pearl earrings and ring to his finger. Kanagaraya was very much disturbed as his son was very helpful to him in all aspects. When they returned from the cemetery, Ananda Ranga pillai records that Kanagaraya's wife's sari was set ablaze in an accident and one his Kanagaraya's house was destroyed in fire costing him around 100 varagans. All of this are considered by Ananda Ranga pillai as astrological misfortunes. Feast for building St. Andrews Church St. Andrews Church, built by Kanagaraya Mudaliar in memory of his son Ananda Ranga Pillai records in his diary the erection of a new church on 30 November 1745 by Kanagaraya. On this day he has invited he invited everyone without distinction of caste or religion. This is the first recorded equality meal (‡Æö‡ÆÆ ‡Æ™‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø ‡Æµ‡Æø‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡ØÅ) in Tamil Nadu. He invited all the Brahmans, Vellazhas, Komuttis, Chettis, goldsmiths, weavers, oil-mongers, and people of other castes along all Europeans and Christians. Ranga pillai notes that Kanagaraya made elaborate arrangements for preparation of food. Different caste people were prepared food in places of Pondicherry as per their tradition. Ranga Pillai states that the feast started at 1:00 PM. The Governor Dupleix, his consort, in company with all the members of Council partook of the banquet. He remained until 5 in the evening, and then returned to Mortancli Cbavadi. They only problem was that each caste people were forced to partake in the banquet as per his caste traditions alone. Death On the afternoon of 11 February 1746, Kanagaraya Mudali fell ill and almost unconscious. His wife Natchathiram sent word to the wife of the governor, Jeanne Dupleix. She came and consoled Kanagaraya Mudaliar. Natchathiram requested Jeanne Dupleix to seal her husband's house, in case of his passing away, so that his brother wouldn't claim his property. On 12 February 1746, at 05:00 AM, Kanagaraya Mudaliar died. He left behind his wife and his childless, widowed daughter-in-law. The house was sealed as requested by Natchathiram. A grand state funeral was arranged. It is described by Ananda Ranga Pillai in his diary as follows: > The Mudali's body, handsomely dressed, girt with the laced sash which M. > Dumas had sent from Europe, and adorned in many other ways ‚Äî exactly as a > king when coming out of his palace ‚Äî was then put in a coffin ; and the > corpse was brought out at 7 in the evening. A stately horse, followed by > forty soldiers, bearing arms, was led in front of the procession ; the drums > beat a funeral march ; forty European boys studying in the mission college > marched along in two lines, on either side of the cortege ; and the priests > of the church of the Capuchins and that of St. Paul went along reciting > prayers, according to the rites prescribed by their religion. Then the > Councillors and the ladies of their families, numbers of the European gentry > of both sexes, natives, Muhammadans, and other people, including women, came > out to look at the procession. There was no one in the crowd who did not > feel sorry for this death. As the corpse was in this wise being borne along > from the house to the burial ground, amidst general mourning, the Governor, > his lady, and some of the Councillors, came, and waited near the Kalatti > Iswaran temple. When the coffin approached, the Governor and those with him > stood up, holding candles in their hands, according to the rites of the > Christian religion ; and after it had passed them, they gave these away, > entered their palanciuins, and went home. When the corpse reached the > cemetery, the coffin was lowered into the vault wherein the body of the > Mudali's son was buried; the soldiers then discharged eleven guns were fired > from the fort. After the deceased had been thus interred, the people > departed. The Mudali entered on his duties on Friday 10 September 1724. He > served twenty-one years, five months, and a few days. Scarcely has it been > the lot of any one else to live without interruption in the same style, for > so long a period. =Problem of inheritance= When the question of deciding who should inherit Kanakaraya's property came up in 1748, a committee of 20 officials were appointed to arbitrate. Ananda Ranga Pillai led the committee. The committee decided that Chinna Mudali, the brother of the deceased Kanakaraya Mudali was the rightful heir to his estate. However, Chinna Mudali was not satisfied and the matter dragged on till April 1746, when Dupleix decided the case combining Mitakshara law and the concept of legitim from French jurisprudence. Balancing the interests of the two women was what Dupleix had to achieve. The women were given life interest in the property and, after their lifetime, the properties were to go to Kanakaraya's brother Tanappa Mudaliar. Namesakes A street near Gopal Pillaiyar Temple in Tiruvanamalai (former French colony) is named after him as Kanakaraya Mudali Street.

Marrying young, they are traditionally subservient to their husbands. Roughly a third have their first child before the age of 19, and those who wish to delay having children may not have access to contraceptives. Abortion is common, with an estimated 24 percent of women having had one. Although they are constitutionally equal to men, they have unequal property rights and employment opportunities in certain areas. Health Malagasy women have a higher life expectancy than men, with an average of 61.3 years compared to 57.7 for men in 2010. There are more women than men; women represent 50.3 percent of the country's 2010 population of 19,669,953. Anemia is prevalent in Malagasy women, with 36 percent suffering from it in some form, mostly mild. The prevalence has decreased in recent years. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Madagascar is lower than the average for Africa, with the national rate estimated at 1 percent. Pregnant women had low rates. However, the rates of other sexually transmitted diseases, especially syphilis, are high. Family life A Malagasy woman with her child Malagasy law requires women to be 14 years of age before they are married, lower than the minimum age for males. Before the age of 18, only parental consent is required for a woman to be married, while women over the age of 18 must give their own consent. According to the United Nations, of women between the ages 15 and 19, 34 percent had already been married. Polygamy is forbidden, although it still happens. The culture is traditionally patriarchal. Fertility Although the total fertility rate in Madagascar is experiencing a decrease, the large number of women of child-bearing age has ensured that population momentum will cause the total number of births to increase. This effect is expected to have subsided within 30 years. Approximately a third of Malagasy women under the age 19 have already had at least one child, and most breastfeed, with 51 percent breastfeeding exclusively for six months. Although Malagasy women have increasingly begun to use contraceptives, both oral and injected, those used are not enough; only 1.5 percent of women use implanted contraceptives. The abortion rate is estimated at 1 in 10, with 24 percent of women having undergone an abortion. Fifteen percent of married women wishing to use contraceptives have no access to family planning initiatives. In the majority of cases a woman's husband entirely or partially decides what actions should be taken. There is a minority opinion (held by 9 percent of women and 8 percent of men) that a husband may beat his wife if she refuses sex. The effect of education has been seen in Madagascar's infant mortality rate. According to Maryanne Sharp and Ioana Kruse of the World Bank note that mothers who have finished their secondary education experience fewer than forty to fifty percent of the infant deaths experienced by women with less education. Younger women are also less likely to have babies who die while young. The average perinatal mortality rate has decreased since 2003. The maternal death figure for Madagascar is lower than average in Sub-Saharan Africa, at a total of 498 deaths per 100,000 live births. This death rate remained stable between 2000 and 2009. This figure has been influenced by numerous factors. Although 86 percent receive pre-natal checkups, 49 percent of them are not told if there are complications. Approximately 46 percent of new mothers receive fewer than four post-natal care sessions. Most women give birth outside of health centres, and the number of those who had assistance in giving birth is decreasing; according to Sharp and Kruse, 35 percent of Malagasy women who give birth outside of health centres do not receive medical care. Abortions due to unwanted pregnancies are also a major contributor. Economy A Malagasy woman preparing peanuts Rich and middle-class Malagasy women spend much time cooking, and may work in cassava, rice, and maize production. Poorer women often work in rice production together with male family members, although they most commonly work with dry-field crops. Outside of the harvesting season, they may produce and sell other items to earn income for their families. Malagasy women participate in sharecropping. Some, including divorced, land- owning women without adequate male support, contract out the labour to relatives or other members of the community, while others may work sharecropped lands with their husbands. However, female sharecroppers are rarely counted separately from their husbands. Gender equality Discrimination based on gender is forbidden by the Constitution of Madagascar. However, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) notes that there are still reports of discrimination in inheritance law. The OECD has rated the degree of gender discrimination as medium on the Social Institutions and Gender Index. Women legally have equal ownership rights, although in locations along the east coast of Madagascar they may be unable to own land. They are allowed to own their own businesses and do not require permission from their husband to acquire land. Their civil liberties are generally well-respected. However, in cases of spousal abuse, women must report the crime themselves in order for the police to act. Although calling the police is rare, women also have a traditional right known as misintaka that allows them to leave their husbands and live with their families. There is a perception that women in Madagascar should focus on cooking, with farming handled by the men. As such, poorer Malagasy women are not allowed to assist in the farming on other people's land. In a divorce, Malagasy women traditionally receive a third of the property acquired during their marriage, with their husband receiving the remaining two-thirds; they may also choose to keep their property separate during marriage. When the husband dies, a Malagasy widow who has borne a child receives half of the joint property. However, if the couple was childless then the husband's family received most of the inheritance.

BHMCU is the first combined major crime investigation team in the UK, composed of officers from Bedfordshire Police and Hertfordshire Constabulary, established to \\"give greater capacity for responding to the most serious crimes.\\" Background In April 2011, a man complained to Bedfordshire Police that he had been \\"enslaved, frequently beaten and threatened with more violence after being offered work outside a job centre.\\" The allegations centred on Greenacres Caravan Park, an Irish Traveller site in Little Billington, Bedfordshire. The allegations led to the launch of the operation, which began with several months of undercover observation and covert intelligence gathering, involving the Serious Organised Crime Agency's Human Trafficking Centre. Police concluded the site was \\"the hub of a multi- million pound trafficking operation that spans beyond the UK\\", and that some of the men may have been moved to Scandinavia and other parts of Europe to work. During 2011 police forces from four other counties in England raided Irish Traveller sites in connection with forced labour and human trafficking. Greenacres Caravan Park raid At 0530 UTC on 11 September 2011, approximately 100 police officers from BHMCU and other specialist units including the dog section, force helicopter and Authorised Firearms Officers, raided the caravan park to execute search warrants. As a result, four men and one woman were arrested and a further 24 men, all believed to be victims of slavery, were taken from the site. The arrests were made under the provisions of Section 71 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, implemented in April 2010 to comply with Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which made it a criminal offence to hold someone \\"in slavery or servitude, or requir[e] them to perform forced or compulsory labour.\\" The youngest of the 24 was a 17-year-old boy, who, when released, returned to his family. Nine of the freed men later discharged themselves from hospital and refused to assist police. One of the nine accused the police of heavy-handed tactics, saying he had lived on the caravan site for several years working as a paver for ¬£50 a day, claiming many of the other men were similarly paid. Initial news reports claimed that the police had been warned 28 previous times that captives were being held at the caravan park, or that 28 captives escaped, but officers explained that this was \\"a misunderstanding\\", and that the witness whose allegation had launched the operation in April had told them that 28 people were still being held as slaves. Most of the 24 were said to have been homeless or suffering from alcoholism. Police also found drugs, money and weapons during the raid. Of the fifteen freed men helping police, eight were of British nationality, three Polish, one Latvian and one Lithuanian, with two men of unconfirmed nationality, and ranged in age from 30 to 57 years. They were being housed temporarily at a British Red Cross rest centre set up to provide shelter for them while alternative accommodation was found and other necessary arrangements made. A Red Cross spokesperson said: \\"Our emergency response volunteers are offering emotional support and giving the men any practical help they need, such as clothing and hygiene kits. We have also provided recreational activities such as games, a radio and DVDs.\\" On 12 September 2011, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced that Tommy Connors (30), Patrick Connors (19), James Connors (34) and James Connors (23) had been charged with \\"conspiracy to hold a person in servitude and requiring them to perform forced labour\\" and were remanded in custody to appear at Luton Magistrates' Court on 13 September 2011. A spokesman CPS Thames and Chiltern Complex Casework Unit explained: \\"These charges relate to four victims who allege they have been held against their will and forced to live and work like slaves.\\" A fifth person arrested, a woman, Josie Connors (aged 30), whom police revealed was pregnant, was originally released on police bail to be questioned further following the \\"imminent\\" birth of her child. However, on 15 September, she was charged with four offences related to activities at the Greenacres site. At a subsequent hearing, on 22 September, she was remanded on bail until 5 December 2011, on condition that she remained at home and only left to give birth at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Aylesbury. Speaking on 12 September Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) Sean O'Neil of BHMCU said: \\"I am confident that while the investigation is in its early stages this is a family-run 'business' and is an organised crime group that has been broken up by the Netwing operation.\\" DCI O'Neil explained: \\"Some of these people have come out covered in excrement and dirty clothing because that was all they were allowed to live in. After being cared for, given food and fresh clothing, we hope to then interview them. That in itself will take a long time because these people are institutionalized. One person we know has been here fifteen years, so to him this is normal life.\\" On 21 September 2011, three further arrests took place at the caravan park. One of those arrested, Johnny Connors (30), was charged later that day with four offences including conspiracy to hold someone in servitude, and conspiracy to require someone to perform forced labour. The other two arrested were a woman (61) remanded in custody, and a man (51) who was released on police bail pending medical treatment.Bedfordshire slavery investigation: Three more arrested \\"BBC News online\\"; accessed 22 September 2011.

The trial lasted 13 weeks.Travellers found guilty in slavery trial, uk.news.yahoo.com; accessed 31 October 2014. Reactions Andrew Selous, MP for South West Bedfordshire, told the House of Commons: \\"Following this weekend's utterly despicable revelations of the way in which twenty-four of my constituents have been kept as slaves, some for fifteen years, I'd like to commend the robust action of Bedfordshire Police in bringing this to light\\", and asked the Government to \\"pay particular attention to the issue of internal trafficking within the UK, given that seventeen of these twenty-four slaves were British citizens.\\" Damian Green MP, Minister of State for Immigration said the incident \\"came as a shock to many of us. What we saw was effective police action, co-ordinated in many ways by the Serious Organised Crime Agency. The new National Crime Agency will have among its functions co-ordinating activity against trafficking, both domestic and international, which will give us a much more effective way of combating this particularly vile crime.\\" Klara Skrivankova, Trafficking Programme Coordinator at Anti-Slavery International, said: \\"Slavery and this case which appears to be a case of forced labour is a reality in Britain today but I think what it shows to us is that the police have finally been given proper powers in the new law that has been mentioned in order to investigate and really go after those who are still behaving like slave-masters in the 21st century.\\" In an article on 16 April 2008, Dr Donald Kenrick, an expert on the Romany language, is quoted as saying \\"Dossers are people gipsies pick up to work for them. They are sometimes called slaves or servants. ... It is common among Irish travellers, but the English do it as well.\\" However he disputed that they were really slaves, saying that the practice meant that otherwise vulnerable people were being cared for. He said the travellers favoured single men, who were strong workers, but of poor mental health. Other related raids at Traveller sites The 2011 series of police investigations on Travellers' sites began after the decomposed body of Christopher Nicholls, missing since 2005, was found in March 2008 near the Beggars Roost caravan site in Staverton, Gloucestershire. Covert surveillance of several Traveller sites began in March 2010 and police observed 22 alleged slaves at the Beggar's Roost site. =Enderby and Pleasley= Around 27 March 2011 simultaneous raids were carried out at Traveller sites in Enderby, Leicestershire, where eight alleged slaves were found, and Pleasley, Derbyshire, where seven alleged slaves were found.

Biography Pierre Frondaie ‚Äì n√© Albert Ren√© Fraudet ‚Äì was born in 1884 in Paris to an upper-middle-class family. He began writing as a teenager and soon devoted himself to the theme that would come to define his career as a man of letters, namely love and its vicissitudes. His success came early. The French stage legend Sarah Bernhardt fostered his talents as an actor and playwright, producing and acting in one of his plays during a triumphant American tour. In 1925, Frondaie published L'Homme √† l'Hispano (The Man in the Hispano-Suiza), the novel that would go on to become his bestseller, translated in 15 languages. The book inspired a successful play, staged in Paris in 1928, and two film adaptations (the first by Julien Duvivier in 1926, the second by Jean Epstein in 1933). Frondaie soon caught the attention of Hollywood, then in its infancy, where several cinematographic adaptations were made of his works for an English-speaking audience by Paramount Pictures and Samuel Goldwyn. In 1928, Howard Hawks directed Fazil, based on Frondaie‚Äôs play L'Insoumise.Bjawi-Levine, Laure: Postface √† L'Homme √† l'Hispano, Editions le Festin (2011), Bordeaux. In France, Frondaie‚Äôs talents earned him a large audience, as well as the respect of his contemporaries, including notable authors such as Pierre Lou√øs and academicians (members of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise) such as Anatole France, Maurice Barr√®s, and Claude Farr√®re. As a playwright, he became a darling of the Parisian stage, with stars such as Polaire, R√©gina Badet, and Sylvie acting in his plays. Productions of his theatrical works toured Europe and made their way to Broadway. From Broadway to Hollywood, few French authors can claim the kind of success Frondaie enjoyed in America at the time. Frondaie was then referred to as a veritable literary phenomenon. From 1942 until his death, Pierre Frondaie ran the Th√©√¢tre de l'Ambigu, in Paris, and focused on directing and producing several of his own plays. At times he was even on stage playing opposite his wife, Maria Favella, an actress. Frondaie‚Äôs flamboyant lifestyle mirrored that of some of the high-society characters he wrote about in his plays and novels. He traveled frequently across the world, jetting between homes in Paris and Arcachon, making regular visits to the Basque coast, and rubbing elbows with the jazz-age beau monde. He was married four times, to illustrious and independent women, but never had children. His first wife, Jeanne Gellier, was an actress known under the stage name of Michelle. After the couple‚Äôs divorce, Frondaie married Madeleine Charnaux, a sculptor, student of Antoine Bourdelle, and later an aviator. This marriage, too, was short lived. Frondaie was then betrothed to lawyer and author Jeanne Loviton (who wrote under the name Jean Voilier). After they separated, Frondaie married Maria Favella, a promising young actress student of the famous Cours Simon and fresh out of the Conservatory. He would spend the rest of his life with her. Frondaie‚Äôs works tend to revolve around love ‚Äì or perhaps the yearning for love ‚Äì and its effects on human relationships and social behavior. Scholars of his work have attributed this theme to two events that profoundly affected the author at a young age: the death of his mother when he was 17, followed a few months later by that of his first love. As a result of these traumas, he was forever haunted by the fear of losing those he loved. In 1948, Frondaie died of a heart attack in Vaucresson, a residential suburb of Paris, in the home he shared with Maria Favella. He was 64. Favella then took over the reins of the Th√©√†tre de l‚ÄôAmbigu, and proved to be a savvy businesswoman. After Frondaie‚Äôs death, she bequeathed his archives to his beloved city of Arcachon.

Bolton's contributions to the band received praise with her voice described as pure and expressive and Bolton herself has been described as a half-forgotten female vocalist of the era ranking alongside Pentangle's Jacqui McShee as well as other contemporary legends like Shirley Collins, Sandy Denny, and Maddy Prior.Unterberger, Richie.

Creating an even more favorable impression on critics, Dando Shaft were soon signed to RCA's progressive offshoot Neon, and in 1971 they created the eponymous album, Dando Shaft. Despite warm critical reviews of the first two albums, neither achieved a great deal of commercial success. Nevertheless, in 1972 Dando Shaft was moved from Neon to the RCA parent label to release Lantaloon. Receiving fewer accolades for this effort than for the previous two albums, and with even less prospect of commercial success, the band began to move in the direction of mainstream rock eventually resulting in the single \\"Sun Clog Dance\\". This shift, however, caused internal dissension and the band soon broke up with Dempsey and Bolton forming a duo for a time in the USA, and Jenkins joining Hedgehog Pie on the Newcastle-upon-Tyne label Rubber Records. A few years later Rubber extended a recording deal to the duo of Jenkins and Cooper, and at this point Dempsey, Bolton, and Kay expressed an interest in recording again as Dando Shaft. Rubber was supportive of this decision and the band's short-lived reunion resulted in the 1977 release of Kingdom, a significantly more electric offering. This album also included a number of prominent guest musicians including Pentangle double-bassist Danny Thompson as well as drummer John Stevens, saxophone player Paul Dunmall, electric bassist Rod Clements, and keyboard player Tommy Kearton all performing on individual tracks. During the mid-1980s Jenkins and Dempsey reunited as members of Whippersnapper with Dave Swarbrick and Chris Leslie, occasionally performing Dando Shaft material. During this time Bolton also engaged in a successful solo career, eventually joining The Albion Band. Jenkins and Cooper also performed with Pentangle's Bert Jansch for a period during which time Bolton and Jansch had a brief 1-year relationship.Harper, Colin & Marr, Johnny. Dazzling Stranger: Bert Jansch and the British Folk and Blues Revival. Bloomsbury Publishing. 2007. p.265. Jenkins and Jansch released Carry Your Smile in 1984. At last in 1989, at the encouragement of an Italian promoter, Dando Shaft re-formed for a week- long concert series in Italy. An Italian live album Shadows Across the Moon was released in 1993 from material recorded during this session. Most recently, compilation/anthology albums of Dando Shaft material have been released with Reaping the Harvest released in 1990 and Anthology released in 2002 (rereleased in 2005). Influences Apart from the traditional themes of English and Irish folklore redolent throughout the folk revival, the most notable influence on Dando Shaft was that of contemporary folk band Pentangle. Other elements unique to the Dando Shaft sound, however, included the progressive use of Bulgarian tempos, a more multi-instrumental approach, and a psychedelic sound reminiscent of the works of Scottish contemporaries The Incredible String Band.

Traditionally the cross patt√©e has been associated with him, but in more recent times the Saint Patrick's Saltire has also been linked to him. Some authors have stated however, that Patrick is not entitled to have a cross as a symbol since he was not a martyr, unlike Saints George and Andrew.Hayes-McCoy, p.38 Saltire Saint Patrick's Flag Saint Patrick's Saltire is a red saltire on a white field. It is used in the insignia of the Order of Saint Patrick, established in 1783, and after the Acts of Union 1800 it was combined with the Saint George's Cross of England and the Saint Andrew's Cross of Scotland to form the Union Flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. A saltire was intermittently used as a symbol of Ireland from the seventeenth century, but without reference to Saint Patrick. The Pepys Library's collection of broadside ballads includes one from c.1690 called \\"Teague and Sawney: or The Unfortunate Success of a Dear-Joys Devotion by St. Patrick's Cross. Being Transform'd into the Deel's Whirlegig.\\" It describes an Irishman (Teague) and Scot (Sawney), both stereotypically blockheaded, encountering a windmill for the first time and arguing over whether it is Saint Andrew's Cross or Saint Patrick's Cross. Teague and Sawney English Broadside Ballad Archive, University of California-Santa Barbara Cross patt√©e A cross patt√©e Downpatrick road sign showing the cross patt√©e, October 2009 Some of the Order of St Patrick's symbols were borrowed from the pre-existing Friendly Brothers of St Patrick, including the motto Quis separabit?; however, the \\"Saint Patrick's Cross\\" used in the Friendly Brothers' badge was not a saltire. A 1783 letter to a Dublin newspaper criticising the Order's use of a saltire, asserted that \\"The Cross generally used on St Patrick's day, by Irishmen, is the Cross-Patee\\". Whereas Vincent Morley in 1999 characterised the Friendly Brothers' cross as a cross patt√©e, the Brothers' medallist in 2003 said that the shape varied somewhat, often approximating a Maltese Cross. Varying illustrations of the badge figure in the Brothers' 1763 statute book, a 1786 letter to The Gentleman's Magazine, and a 2008 photograph. Though both patt√©e and Patrick begin with pat-, the words are unrelated. Or a Cross Gules Henry Gough in 1893 noted that Ireland was represented by a harp in the flags of the Protectorate, but at Oliver Cromwell's funeral the national banners had crosses, Ireland's being a red cross on a gold field. Gough guesses Edward Bysshe may have co-opted the de Burgh Earl of Ulster arms for the purpose. Gough suggests it gained currency in subsequent decades; it was called Patrick's Cross and shown alongside those of George and Andrew in various documents, including a 1697 drawing of William III, and The Irish Compendium of 1722. A 1679 pamphlet account of heraldry states that the arms borne in the Crusades by the Irish Nation were \\"a red Cross in a yellow Field\\". In 1688, Randle Holme explicitly calls this (Or a Cross Gules) \\"St. Patrick's Cross\\" \\"for Ireland\\".Holme, Chap.5, p.2 The County Galway unit of the Irish Volunteers in 1914 adopted a similar banner because \\"it was used as the Irish flag in Cromwell's time\\".Hayes-McCoy, p.200 The flag used by the King's Own Regiment in the Kingdom of Ireland, established in 1653, was a red saltire on a \\"taffey\\" yellow background. The origins of the regimental colours remain a mystery however.http://historyreconsidered.net/Irish_Military_Establishment_1660_1688.html Other heraldic designs A cross moline In 1593‚Äì94, Irish Catholics in Habsburg Spain made unrealised plans for a \\"military order of Saint Patrick\\" to fight in the Nine Years' War, whose knights would wear a cross moline badge. A 1935 article states that during the Confederation, \\"the true St. Patrick's Cross was carried as a square flag: a white cross on a green ground, with a red circle.\\" Monuments Ancient high crosses called \\"Saint Patrick's cross\\" existed at places with legendary associations with the saint: the Rock of Cashel, where he baptised √ìengus mac Nad Fro√≠ch, King of Munster. and Station Island, site of Saint Patrick's Purgatory, in Lough Derg, County Donegal. Until the 18th century there was a \\"St Patrick's Cross\\" in Liverpool, marking the spot where he supposedly preached before starting his mission to Ireland.Saint Patrick's Cross Liverpool Ballina crest, including stylised Patrick's Cross carving between two pikes The arms of Ballina, County Mayo, adopted in 1970, include an image of \\"St Patrick's cross\\" carved on a rock in Leigue cemetery, said to date from Patrick's visit there in AD 441. Saint Patrick's Day badges Traditional St. Patrick's Day badges from the early 20th century, from the Museum of Country Life, Castlebar. It was formerly a common custom to wear a cross made of paper or ribbon on St Patrick's Day. Surviving examples of such badges come in a variety of coloursHayes-McCoy, p.40 and they were worn upright rather than as saltires. The second part of Richard Johnson's Seven Champions of Christendom (1608) concludes its fanciful account of St Patrick with, \\"the Irishmen as well in England as in that Country, do as yet in Honour of his Name, keep one day in the Year Festival, wearing upon their Hats each of them a Cross of red Silk, in Token of his many Adventures, under the Christian Cross\\". Irish soldiers stationed in Britain in 1628 reportedly wore red crosses on Patrick's Day \\"after their country manner\\". Thomas Dinely, an English traveller in Ireland in 1681, remarked that \\"the Irish of all stations and condic√µns were crosses in their hatts, some of pins, some of green ribbon.\\" Jonathan Swift, writing to \\"Stella\\" of Saint Patrick's Day 1713, said \\"the Mall was so full of crosses that I thought all the world was Irish\\". The crosses were also associated with Irish regiments, who were reported in 1682 to have been seen wearing crosses of red ribbon on St Patrick's Day; and with the English court, who were said to have worn crosses in honour of St Patrick on the saint's day in 1726. In the 1740s, the badges pinned were multicoloured interlaced fabric. The popular songs of Ireland, pp.7-9 collected and ed., with intr. and notes, By Thomas Crofton Croker Published 1839 In the 1820s, they were only worn by children, with simple multicoloured daisy patterns. In the 1890s, they were almost extinct, and a simple green Greek cross inscribed in a circle of paper (similar to the Ballina crest pictured).Colgan, p.351, fn.2 The Irish Times in 1935 reported they were still sold in poorer parts of Dublin, but fewer than those of previous years \\"some in velvet or embroidered silk or poplin, with the gold paper cross entwined with shamrocks and ribbons\\". Other references On the St. Patrick halfpenny, Patrick is depicted holding a crozier headed with a patriarchal cross. The badge of the Companions of Saint Patrick, a nonpartisan but mainly unionist group of Dublin civic leaders active from 1906 until the 1930s, featured a red Celtic cross on a white background.; References * Notes Category:Saint Patrick Category:Cross symbols Saint Patrick's Crosses Saint Patrick's Crosses Saint Patrick ","title":"List of Saint Patrick's crosses"},{"id":"33063585","text":"Shri Katyayani Baneshwar Temple (Kannada:‡≤∂‡≥ç‡≤∞‡≥Ä ‡≤ï‡≤æ‡≤§‡≥ç‡≤Ø‡≤æ‡≤Ø‡≤ø‡≤®‡≤ø ‡≤¨‡≤æ‡≤£‡≥á‡≤∂‡≥ç‡≤µ‡≤∞ ‡≤¶‡≥á‡≤µ‡≤∏‡≥ç‡≤§‡≤æ‡≤®),(Sanskrit:‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§º‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ø‡§®‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§æ‡§£‡•á‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡•ç ‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡§ø‡§∞), or the Aversa Hindu Narayani is a Hindu temple in the coastal town of Aversa near Ankola, in the Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka.

Power intoxicated him with such great arrogance that he started disturbing the Rishis in their holy rituals and attacking the Gods. When he defeated Lord Indra and captured his capital Amaravati, Fearing his might and insolence, the Rishis and Gods approached Brahma, Rudra and Lord Narayana and narrated their predicament. As Lord Maha Vishnu heard the details of Mahishasura‚Äôs misdeeds his calm face turned fierce and an intense cosmic ray of light (Divya Jyothi) emanated from his face. Similar cosmic rays of light emanated from the faces of Brahma and Rudra. These rays of celestial/ cosmic lights merged and in its brilliance the divine form of Shri Devi Goddess was seen. Each of the Gods offered their might to HER. Rudra gave his Trishula, Vishnu his Chakra, Varuna his Conch and Vayu his Bow and Arrow. Agni gave his Shastayudha, Yama the Kaladanda, Indra his Vajrayudha & Airavatha, Jaldipathi hands his pasha, Brahmma the lotus flower, Ksheerasagara gives a white garland, white dress, Chudamani, ear rings, the crescent moon necklace and anklets. The Sea God offered a garland of lotus flowers and the Himalayas transformed into a lion (Vahana) to SRI DEVI. This phenomenon was witnessed by a sage called Katyayana. He was a worshipper of SRI DEVI and cherished the desire of her being born as his daughter. Witnessing the incarnation made him change his desire of having HER as his daughter. His devotion intensified and he became one with HER. The Puranas reveal that the divine Goddess highly pleased with this devotion named herself after him as Katyayani. History of Saraswat Brahmin and Goud Saraswat Brahmins The Skanda Puranas mention that Saraswat Brahmins habituated North vindyagiri (Kashmir). They resided on the banks of the Saraswati River. Historical records/ narration state that members of this clan were well educated, highly intelligent people with exceptional cultural and social backgrounds. It is the popular belief that the Vedas and many other holy scriptures of the Hindus originated on the banks of this sacred river. As their population increased they were classified into five divisions based on their place of settlement. 1\\\\. Saraswats - those who lived along the banks of Saraswati River. 2\\\\. Kanya Kubjas - those who lived along the river Kanoj. 3\\\\. Gouds - those who lived on the banks of the southern Ganges 4\\\\. Utkalas - the people who lived in Orissa. 5\\\\. Mythilis - those who lived along the Mythila river in Bihar. Severe drought and famine over a long spell of 12 years, struck the banks of the Saraswati River. The Saraswats were forced to migrate towards Gomantak, present Goa. The original inhabitants of South India, known as Dravidians, addressed these Saraswats as Gouds or people coming from the Goud providence of the northern part of the country. Thus the prefix Gouda Saraswat Brahmins which continues to this day. Originally the Saraswats belonged to six holy lineages of Gothras 1\\\\. Dattatreya 2\\\\. Bharadwaja 3\\\\. Pala Deva 4\\\\. Apamanya 5\\\\. Madagala 6\\\\. Daumyayana References in records show that over a long period of time, these six lineages (gotras) were further dived into 199 lineages‚Äôs spread amongst Saraswats all over India. At present, seven lineages (Gotras) are prevalent 1\\\\. Jamadagni 2\\\\. Bharadwaja 3\\\\. Atri 4\\\\. Kashyapa 5\\\\. Koundinya 6\\\\. Vaisa 7.Kaushik /Kausha Majority of them are worshippers of Shiva and Shakthi under various names. The history of the Temple Having arrived in Gomantaka, the Saraswat and Goud Saraswat Brahmins chose Sashasti provinces (present Madgaon) for their settlement. They prospered and by nature being religious, turned their minds to their Kuladevata. This resulted in building a beautiful temple at Banavli where they worshipped Shri Katyayani and Shri Baneshwar and accompanying deities (Parivar Devathe) with customary rituals and traditions and all faith and devotion. Eventually Gomantaka came under Portuguese invasion in the 16th century and brought along the missionaries. The fear of conversion forced Goud Saraswat and Saraswat Brahmins to migrate elsewhere. Around the 15th/16th centuries the inhabitants of Belekeri used to frequent Goa for trade. The sad plight of the Saraswats under the Portuguese regime brought them to extend their support. Some Kulavee Mahajans along with temple priests and the idols of Gods, their ornaments and other artefacts of the temple, were transported by boat to Belekeri near Aversa by the Kharvi people (warrior class of that period). With the consent of BHUDEVI (Grama Devatha) and on a plot given by her, the Saraswats and Goud Saraswat Brahmins built a small temple at Aversa and continued their devotion. The historical support of the Kharvi community at the time of need begun a grand ritual which is followed to this day. The Prasadam / Prasada Bhojana is served to seven families of the Kharvi community in front of the Shrine (Gudi) of Shree Grama Purusha on the full moon day in the month of ASHVINA (Ashvin Shudda Poornima). This is as a token of gratitude to the Kharvi community for their timely help. The Legend of the present day temple Once a rich merchant named Paulekar was transporting valuable merchandise in a big boat. Nearing Belekeri, his boat was caught in a squall and the craft ran aground on the shore. In spite of his best efforts, he could not set his boat afloat. Being a Kulavee of Shree Katyayani and disheartened by his plight, he came to the temple at Aversa. The night was pitch dark, no one was around, as the Pujari had completed his pooja rituals and gone home. From a small opening in the temple door, the light of the lamps lit within could be seen. The fragrance of camphor and sandal filled the air. The serenity and peacefulness of the atmosphere helped in calming the worried merchant and in this mood he prostrated before the Kulaswamini, narrated his difficulties and vowed to construct a temple in the shape of a boat if SRI DEVI extricated him from his troubles. He then returned to his boat and slept well. Towards dawn he had a dream that an eight-year-old girl pushing his boat with a large barge pole and setting it afloat. He awoke with a start and found it was not merely a dream but a reality. His boat was floating in the sea. As he contemplated, he was struck by the similarity between the face of the idol in the temple and the face of the little girl of his dreams. He was certain that Shri Katyayani had saved him from disaster. With joy in his heart and a deep sense of gratitude he went to the temple at Aversa, where a greater surprise awaited him. He saw the footprints marked with sand and was convinced beyond doubt that Shree Katyayani had saved his boat and merchandise. He stood before the Deity in all humility, offered pooja and vowed to build the temple as soon as possible and left the place. Parulekar‚Äôs business transactions resulted in huge profits and all his time and energy went into the expanding of business and allied monetary gains. In the process he forgot his vow to the Goddess and the help rendered by Her. After a lapse of a few years, when his boat was passing near Belekeri, it suddenly came to a stop. This reminded him that he had not fulfilled his vow given to Sri Kuladevi. He hastened to Aversa and begged for forgiveness for his omissions. He then built the present temple which has a roof resembling an overturned boat.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Blackburn with Darwen, the archdeaconry of Blackburn, and the diocese of Blackburn. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The church was built in 1835‚Äì36. Its architect is uncertain. Although this is self-published, it is a scholarly work and fully referenced throughout. (As of 2011 it is available only as a CD.) In the Buildings of England series Hartwell and Pevsner credit the design to J. W. Whittaker, the Vicar of Blackburn. In the National Heritage List for England it is credited to Whittaker's cousin, the Lancaster architect Edmund Sharpe. Whittaker certainly made the first design for the church, but whether this was replaced or amended by Sharpe is uncertain. The church cost ¬£1,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). The foundation stone was laid on 5 February 1835 by William Feilden, who had given the land for the church, and paid ¬£100 towards its construction. The church was consecrated on 10 October 1836. It was restored in 1931‚Äì32 by Austin and Paley, the successors in Sharpe's practice. During the restoration the original box pews were removed, a pulpit and chancel screen were added, the lower part of the walls were panelled, and the church was re-floored. Architecture =Exterior= Immanuel Church is constructed in gritstone with a slate roof. Its plan consists of a nave and chancel in one cell, a southwest porch, and a west tower with a spire. The tower is short, in two stages, and is embraced by the nave. It has diagonal buttresses, a two-light west window, and rectangular louvred bell openings. The spire is set back and contains lucarnes. There were originally eight pinnacles, but these were removed because of erosion. The windows on the sides of the church are large and straight-headed, with Perpendicular tracery. The east window contains Decorated tracery. =Interior= Inside the church is a west gallery carried on slim iron columns. The stained glass in the east window is dated 1861 and is possibly by Hardman & Co. On the north side of the church are windows dating from the early 20th century by Heaton, Butler and Bayne, and on the south side, dated 1907, are windows by Curtis, Ward and Hughes. The two-manual organ in the west gallery was built by Jardine and Company in 1949, when some of the pipes from the earlier organ built in 1899 by Ernest Wadsworth were reused. The church bell is an eighteenth-century Javanese bell with a dated Javanese inscription originally from Gresik in East Java and donated by a member of the Feilden family who served in Egypt, India and Java during the Napoleonic Wars.

THOC is governed by a 9-member Board of Directors appointed by the President of the Republic for a 3-year term of office, and is run by a Director whose appointment is made by the Board and ratified by the Council of Ministers. There is also an Artistic Committee, an advisory body responsible for artistic matters. Once the budget of THOC has been approved by the competent Ministry and the Council of Ministers, it is tabled for approval by the House of Representatives. The Organisation's policy is set out by the Board.  Stages  Until 1976, THOC organised its performances on two stages: the Main Stage and the Second Stage. Gradually, the requirement of a comprehensive repertoire, aimed at wide-ranging audiences of all ages, interests and preferences, made the creation of additional stages necessary Œ§HOC offers productions through its four stages: * Main Stage: With large- scale productions of classical and modern plays, as well as ancient drama, intended for large audiences and with performances specially scheduled for secondary school students. * New Stage: Established in 1994 as a follow-on from the Second Stage. Plays with small casts are performed in smaller spaces, with a more intimate relationship between stage and audience. * Experimental Stage: Promoting new forms of theatre and research, the Experimental stage is a place where young artists and theatre people with fresh ideas have a channel of expression. * Children's Stage: With plays by authors from Cyprus, Greece and other countries, THOC's Children's Stage successfully reaches out to children of ages from 4-12, with performances specially organised for schools and nurseries.European Theatre Convention - THOC  References   External links  * Official site Category:Theatre companies in Cyprus Category:Theatres in Nicosia Category:Culture in Nicosia ","title":"Theatrical Organization of Cyprus"},{"id":"33063799","text":"The South African Railways Class HF 2-8-2+2-8-2 of 1927 was an articulated steam locomotive. In 1927, the South African Railways placed ten Class HF Modified Fairlie articulated steam locomotives with a 2-8-2+2-8-2 Double Mikado type wheel arrangement in service. An eleventh one was placed in service in 1928.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1945). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter VII - South African Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, December 1945. p. 968. Manufacturer The Class HF Modified Fairlie locomotive was designed and built by Henschel and Son to the specifications of Colonel F.R. Collins DSO, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the South African Railways (SAR). Ten locomotives were built in 1926 and were numbered in the range from 1380 to 1389 when they were delivered in 1927. Another locomotive, number 1390, was built in 1927 and delivered by Henschel in 1928.Henschel-Lieferliste (Henschel & Son works list), compiled by Dietmar Stresow While Henschel of Kassel in Germany had built several locomotive types for German South West Africa prior to the First World War, most of which had come onto the SAR roster in 1922, the Class HF was the first locomotive class to be built by them for the SAR. Characteristics The Class HF was designed for mainline work and was larger and much heavier than the Classes FC and FD Modified Fairlie branchline locomotives of 1925 and 1926. It was the Modified Fairlie equivalent of the Class GE Garratt which was similar in both size and mechanical respects. If the earlier classification practice for Modified Fairlie locomotives had been adhered to, it should logically have been designated Class FE, but the inconsequent designation of Class HF for \\"Henschel Fairlie\\" was used instead. The locomotives had Heusinger-Walschaerts valve gear, bar frames and were superheated. They had round-topped fireboxes, unlike the earlier Modified Fairlie locomotives which had Belpaire fireboxes. They were fitted with the Parry soot-blower which enabled the boiler tubes to be cleaned during running conditions. Reversing was effected from the driver's cab by Hendrie's steam reversers. Provision was made for steam to either engine unit to be cut off in emergencies. The exhaust steam from the rear engine unit was conveyed to the smokebox through a pipe arranged on the left-hand side of the engine on the outside of the main boiler frame. In line with the left-hand side of the smokebox, it then passed through the frame and into the blast pipe. The exhaust steam from the front engine unit passed through a pipe connected directly to the blast pipe, which had two distinct orifices. The two engine units were virtually identical and could be interchanged by a slight alteration in the arrangement of their steam pipes. The coupled wheels had overhung springs and the leading Bissel and trailing carrier wheels of each engine unit had play to each side, while the radial movement of each engine unit was limited at either end. Each engine unit was provided with a steam brake which was actuated automatically in conjunction with the vacuum train brake. In addition, the rear engine unit was fitted with a screw type handbrake, operated from the cab. The locomotives were fitted with Lambert sanding gear with eight sanders, four in front of four wheels in either direction of running. The locomotive had Pyle National electric headlamps which were fitted to brackets above the end buffer beam of each engine unit rather than at the top of the bunkers, to allow the lights to follow the curvature of the track. The turbo-generator to power the lights was arranged on top of the boiler ahead of the safety valves. Shortcomings As built, the locomotives were not successful, with the result that they were staged for some time while the Mechanical Engineer of the Durban workshops, G. Ramsay, carried out experiments with the blast pipe arrangement. After successful modification, their steaming capacity was improved to the extent that they could be placed in service. Like the earlier Modified Fairlies they proved to be powerful locomotives, but they were less successful than their Garratt equivalent. They suffered from the same shortcomings as their Class FC and Class FD predecessors. The long rigid frame resulted in severe overhang on sharp curves and was also prone to metal fatigue and cracked frames, brought about by the long frame overhangs at the front and back beyond the engine unit pivot centres. The overhangs, laden with the water and coal bunkers, tended to oscillate in an up-and-down motion while the locomotive was in motion. The pivot bearings were also subject to quite rapid wear since they carried a considerable additional vertical load concentrated on the centre of the engine units as a result of their water and coal bunkers which were mounted on the main frame instead of on the engine units like those on the Garratt equivalent. This resulted in increased frequency of maintenance and, as a consequence, increased operating cost. Service The maximum axle load of of the Class HF locomotives allowed them to run on rail. They were placed in service on the Natal North Coast line and on the Witwatersrand. They were withdrawn from service by 1951. No more locomotives of the Modified Fairlie design were acquired by the SAR. Knuckle couplers In 1927, the SAR began to convert the couplers of its Cape Gauge rolling stock from the Johnston link-and-pin coupling system which had been in use since the establishment of the Cape Government Railways in 1873, to AAR knuckle couplers. Judging from contemporary photographs as well as the official SAR Locomotive Diagram Book and the dimensional locomotive drawings as published by Holland, which were for the most part based on the original as-delivered and unmodified loco¬≠motives, the Class HF locomotives were delivered new with knuckle couplers fitted, as were the Classes 18, GCA, GF and U which also entered service in 1927.South African Railways & Harbours/Suid Afrikaanse Spoorwe√´ en Hawens (15 Aug 1941).

Drawing Office/Tekenkantoor, Pretoria. Transition era knuckle coupler Conversion of all rolling stock would take several years and both coupler types could still be seen on rolling stock into the late 1950s. During the transition period, knuckle couplers on locomotives had a horizontal gap and a vertical hole in the knuckle itself to accommodate a link and a pin respectively. This enabled them to couple to vehicles which were still equipped with the older Johnston couplers. Knuckle couplers had first been used in South Africa more than two decades earlier. The Central South African Railways (CSAR) introduced Gould knuckle couplers on the rolling stock of its Limited Express and Imperial Mail passenger trains in 1904. The Limited Express operated between Pretoria and Johannesburg while the Imperial Mail operated between Pretoria and Cape Town. These knuckle-couplers also had split knuckles to accommodate coupling to the old Johnston couplers with a link and pin, since the CSAR retained the old couplers on all their locomotives to keep them compatible with their own goods and older passenger rolling stock as well as with that from the other railways it connected with.Soul of A Railway, System 8, Part 1: Pretoria: including local services, workshops and running sheds, Part 1.

The project was instituted by the German linguist Friedrich Panzer (Heidelberg) in association with the historians Karl Brandi (G√∂ttingen) and Hans Hirsch (Vienna) as an interacademic venture of epigraphical publication in 1934. Encompassed are inscriptions ranging from the Early Middle Ages to the year of 1650 (and later on) localized in the areas that are today known as the Federal Republic of Germany, the Republic of Austria and South Tyrol. By now the epigraphical research centers involved have published 81 volumes. An individual volume contains usually the inscriptions of a single city or Landkreis respectively called Politischer Bezirk in Austria. The venture is supported by the German Academies of Sciences in Berlin, D√ºsseldorf, G√∂ttingen, Heidelberg, Leipzig, Mainz and M√ºnchen as well as the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna. The Reichert- Verlag is the publishing house of the scientific editions.  Deutsche Inschriften Online (DIO)  The project \\"Deutsche Inschriften Online\\" (engl.: German Inscriptions Online) was planned and implemented as an interacademic venture by the Academies of Sciences in Mainz and G√∂ttingen. The project's aim was to digitise the volumes DI 66/45/56/58/61 and make them available online. The realisation is based on a database which was developed by the Inscription- offices in Greifswald and Mainz. The venture has an innovative character. It is a broadening of the project \\"Inschriften Mittelrhein-Hunsr√ºck (IMH)\\" (engl.: Inscriptions of the Middlerhine-Hunsr√ºck) conducted in 2008 in cooperation with the \\"Institut f√ºr Geschichtliche Landeskunde an der Universit√§t Mainz\\" (engl.: Institute for Regional History located at the University of Mainz). The project digitised the volume \\"Die Inschriften des Rhein-Hunsr√ºck Kreises I (DI 60)\\" (engl.: The Inscriptions of the Rhine- Hunsr√ºck District) edited by epigraphist Eberhard J. Nikitsch. In the meantime the website of the IMH-Project has merged into the DIO-Web portal. There is a long term plan for digitising and making available online further volumes; and well as providing an English translation of the DIO-Website. Besides the digitized scientific volumes DIO features; an advanced search interface; information concerning epigraphy; a number of regular series, on topics such as \\"Epigraphischer Tipp\\" (engl.: Epigraphical Hint) and \\"Inschrift im Fokus\\" (engl.: Focused on Inscription); a glossary; and a list of topical weblinks. In addition the site presents a wide range of photographic images and illustrations of inscriptions or similar objects as a means of interlinking all possible information.

As a section of the A8 motorway bypassing the center of Wroclaw, the bridge links both sections of the route across the Oder, providing connections to the A4 motorway to the south, and to the S5 and S8 expressways to the northeast. With its pylon reaching a height of 122 m (400 ft) and having a total length of 1.7 km (1.1 mi), the Rƒôdzi≈Ñski Bridge is the tallest and longest bridge in Poland. History Designed by Jan Biliszczuk, a professor of engineering at the Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology, the bridge's design exceeded the length of the Solidarity Bridge in P≈Çock by 30 m, then the longest bridge in the country. The contracts for the bridge's construction were awarded to the Warsaw-based Mostostal consortium and its parent Spanish firm, Acciona Infraestructuras on 20 May 2008, with construction commencing shortly afterwards. Construction of the bridge (and its main A8 motorway) continued for the next three years. Building efforts were temporarily halted during the 2010 Central European floods, but later resumed after a short delay. The structure was unofficially named the Rƒôdzi≈Ñski Bridge by its builders due to the bridge's spanning of Rƒôdzi≈Ñska Island in the Oder. In August 2011, the Wroc≈Çaw bureau of GDDKiA, the branch of the Ministry of Infrastructure tasked to roads, organized a naming competition of the bridge. After over 15,000 ballots cast, \\"Rƒôdzi≈Ñski\\" won 55 percent of all total votes. The name defeated other popular choices such as \\"≈ölƒÖski\\" by a wide margin. Construction was completed by the end of August 2011. Financial costs for the bridge are estimated at 576 million PLN. Shortly before the bridge's opening to public traffic, coinciding with the opening of the last sections of the A8 motorway, Prime Minister Donald Tusk visited the sight and praised its engineering. \\"This, I think, is a very good place and a very good moment to say that Poland is really under construction in a breathtaking way, at least in some places,\\" Tusk was quoted. The bridge opened to A8 traffic on 31 August 2011, just over a year before start of the UEFA Euro 2012. Main span has 512 m long and consists of two cable-stayed spans 256 m long each. The bridge is the longest cable-stayed bridge with one pylon in Poland.

He threw and batted left-handed, and was listed as tall and . He began his pro baseball career in 1934 in the Cincinnati farm system, and the following year saw his debut in the majors. During a September recall, after he had led the Class B Piedmont League in runs scored, Scarsella appeared in six games for the Reds and collected his first two big-league hits in ten at bats. After a torrid start to the season with the top-level Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League, Scarsella was recalled to Cincinnati for his most productive MLB campaign. Appearing in 115 games as the Reds' regular first baseman between May 29 and the end of the season, Scarsella reached career highs in games played and all offensive categories, batting .313 with 152 hits, 21 doubles, nine triples, three home runs and 65 runs batted in.

He had three three-hit games during the season's first month and was still batting .300 for Boston on May 20, when his contract was sold to another International League club, the Buffalo Bisons. The transaction marked the end of Scarsella's major league career, during which he collected 255 hits, with 34 doubles, 16 triples and six homers. He knocked in 109 runs. Scarsella returned to the West Coast in 1941 and launched a successful nine-year tenure in the top-level Pacific Coast League, hitting over .300 six times and winning MVP honors in 1944 (when he was the league's batting champion) and 1946. According to his obituary, Scarsella spurned the opportunity to return to the majors during the World War II manpower shortage, saying he preferred to remain in his native California rather than return to the East or Midwest to play in the majors. Scarsella died from a heart ailment in San Francisco nine years after his career ended. He was 45 years of age.

Craig Zahler.  Plot  During 1989 in Washington, George (Rupert Evans), Max (Kenny Doughty) and Ricky (Joseph Kennedy) are in a band, but it is clear that the group is starting to fall apart. Ricky is unreliable, Max is immature and George is becoming distant as he builds a relationship with his girlfriend Lynn (Anna Skellern). In order to make ends meet, the three also work in the cafeteria of an asylum for the criminally insane along with William (Marcus Garvey). George is the head chef and puts effort into preparing high quality food and being courteous to the inmates. The inmates are generally docile due to the pills they take, but one inmate in particular named Harry Green (Richard Brake) creeps George out. One morning after a late- night rock show, an exhausted George has to come in early to work in a torrential downpour. Many bad omens occur, with the chicken meat still attached to the heads, George cutting himself, and later, he loses his temper at both his bandmates and Harry, who stares menacingly at him. George also thinks that he sees Harry convince a fellow inmate to spit out his pills. Max tells George to take a nap while he prepares dinner. A few hours later, however, an explosion is heard and Max wakes George up to tell him that the power has gone out in the building. Because the exterior doors are electronically locked, everyone is now trapped inside the building. Many of the inmates have already been brought into the dining room for dinner service and the head guard enlists George and William to help escort them back to their cells. Unknown to those in the kitchen, several other inmates have seized the opportunity to overtake and kill the prison guards and nurses on the other side of the building. George and William succeed in getting the inmates to their cells, but they see that the inmates are growing restless and the locks on all the doors are not working. When they return to the kitchen, they find the head guard has disappeared and Ricky and Max have barricaded themselves in the freezer. Suddenly, several inmates walk into the dining area and begin trying to break into the kitchen. Max, William, and George manage to sneak out of the kitchen after the inmates break in, but Ricky refuses to come with them and remains barricaded in the freezer. George sees Harry smiling at all of the mayhem, appearing to be the ringleader of the riots. The threesome run around the asylum, finding the head guard decapitated. They eventually make their way to the head guard's office and use the landline phone to call the police, but are told that the police will be unable to respond for at least an hour. Eventually, the prisoners capture Ricky and fatally impale him in front of George, Max, and William. At Harry's urging, the inmates storm the head guard office, although the cooks manage to kill all of the ones who attack however, Max's nose is bitten off in the struggle. The three flee back to the kitchen, but eventually George is knocked out and Max is captured. When George awakens, he is naked and tied to a table. George is forced to watch as inmates burn Max alive on the stove top. One inmate also begins mutilating George, though eventually George convinces him to leave him alone. George is finally confronted by Harry, who begins to gleefully eat his own fingers. George screams at Harry to end the madness to no avail. George hears police sirens and soon, William leads the police into the kitchen, but Harry has disappeared. As the medics begin wheeling George out of the asylum, he looks over to see the corpse of Harry, with all his fingers intact, apparently having been killed at the very beginning of the riot. Apparently, George has hallucinated Harry's presence throughout the night. The film jumps ahead to focus on George in a bed while Lynn cries at his side. George has a vacant expression, having seemingly been driven mad by his experience. The camera zooms into George's mind where he is still working in the cafeteria with his bandmates, and the inmates are still on the loose.

The rabbit as well as the hare have been associated with moon deities and may signify rebirth or resurrection. They may also be symbols of fertility or sensuality, and they appear in depictions of hunting and spring scenes in the Labours of the Months.  Judaism  The rabbit as a gift in courtship, exterior detail of a red-figure kylix, (Athens c. 480 BC) In Judaism, the rabbit is considered an unclean animal, because \\"though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof.\\"Leviticus 11:6, cf. Deuteronomy 14:7 This led to derogatory statements in the Christian art of the Middle Ages, and to an ambiguous interpretation of the rabbit's symbolism. The \\"shafan\\" in Hebrew has symbolic meaning. Although rabbits were a non-kosher animal in the Bible, positive symbolic connotations were sometimes noted, as for lions and eagles. 16th century German scholar Rabbi Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi, saw the rabbits as a symbol of the Diaspora. In any case, a three hares motif was a prominent part of many Synagogues.  Classical Antiquity  In Classical Antiquity, the hare, because it was prized as a hunting quarry, was seen as the epitome of the hunted creature that could survive only by prolific breeding. Herodotus,Herodotus, The Histories 3.108 Aristotle, Pliny and Claudius Aelianus all described the rabbit as one of the most fertile of animals. It thus became a symbol of vitality, sexual desire and fertility. The hare served as an attribute of Aphrodite and as a gift between lovers. In late antiquity it was used as a symbol of good luck and in connection with ancient burial traditions.  Christian art  Venus, Mars and Cupid by Piero di Cosimo, a Cupid lying on Venus clings to a white rabbit. In Early Christian art, hares appeared on reliefs, epitaphs, icons and oil lamps although their significance is not always clear. The Physiologus, a resource for medieval artists, states that when in danger the rabbit seeks safety by climbing high up rocky cliffs, but when running back down, because of its short front legs, it is quickly caught by its predators.Physiologus. Ed. by Ursula Treu. 3rd edition. Hanau 1998. pp. 103‚Äì104 (German). Likewise, according to the teaching of St. Basil, men should seek his salvation in the rock of Christ, rather than descending to seek worldly things and falling into the hands of the devil. The negative view of the rabbit as an unclean animal, which derived from the Old Testament, always remained present for medieval artists and their patrons. Thus the rabbit can have a negative connotation of unbridled sexuality and lust or a positive meaning as a symbol of the steep path to salvation. Whether a representation of a hare in Medieval art represents man falling to his doom or striving for his eternal salvation is therefore open to interpretation, depending on context. The three hares at Paderborn Cathedral The Hasenfenster (hare windows) in Paderborn Cathedral and in the Muotathal Monastery in Switzerland, in which three hares are depicted with only three ears between them, forming a triangle, can be seen as a symbol of the Trinity, and probably go back to an old symbol for the passage of time. The three hares shown in Albrecht D√ºrer's woodcut, The Holy Family with the Three Hares (1497), can also be seen as a symbol of the Trinity. The idea of rabbits as a symbol of vitality, rebirth and resurrection derives from antiquity. This explains their role in connection with Easter, the resurrection of Christ. The unusual presentation in Christian iconography of a Madonna with the Infant Jesus playing with a white rabbit in Titian's Parisian painting, can thus be interpreted christologically. Together with the basket of bread and wine, a symbol of the sacrificial death of Christ, the picture may be interpreted as the resurrection of Christ after death. The phenomenon of superfetation, where embryos from different menstrual cycles are present in the uterus, results in hares and rabbits being able to give birth seemingly without having been impregnated, which caused them to be seen as symbols of virginity.Lumpkin, Susan; John Seidensticker (2011). Rabbits: The Animal Answer Guide. JHU Press. . p. 122. Rabbits also live underground, an echo of the tomb of Christ. Titian, Mary and Infant Jesus with a rabbit, Paris, Louvre, c. 1530 As a symbol of fertility, white rabbits appear on a wing of the high altar in Freiburg Minster. They are playing at the feet of two pregnant women, Mary and Elizabeth. Martin Schongauer's engraving Jesus after the Temptation (1470) shows nine (three times three) rabbits at the feet of Jesus Christ, which can be seen as a sign of extreme vitality. In contrast, the tiny squashed rabbits at the base of the columns in Jan van Eyck's Rolin Madonna symbolize \\"Lust\\", as part of a set of references in the painting to all the Seven Deadly Sins.Harbison, Craig. Jan van Eyck, The Play of Realism, p. 114, Reaktion Books, London, 1991, St. Jerome Reading in the Countryside, by Giovanni Bellini, with a white hare, 1505 Hunting scenes in the sacred context can be understood as the pursuit of good through evil. In the Romanesque sculpture (c. 1135) in the K√∂nigslutter imperial Cathedral, a hare pursued by a hunter symbolises the human soul seeking to escape persecution by the devil. Another painting, Hares Catch the Hunters, shows the triumph of good over evil. Alternatively, when an eagle pursues the hare, the eagle can be seen as symbolizing Christ and the hare, uncleanliness and the evil's terror in the face of the light. In Christian iconography, the hare is an attribute of Saint Martin of Tours and Saint Alberto di Siena, because legend has it that both protected hares from persecution by dogs and hunters. They are also an attribute of the patron saint of Spanish hunters, Olegarius of Barcelona. White hares and rabbits were sometimes the symbols of chastity and purity.  In secular art  Hunting still life with lap dog and monkey by Jan Weenix, 1714 National Museum in Warsaw In non-religious art of the modern era, the rabbit appears in the same context as in antiquity: as prey for the hunter, or representing spring or autumn, as well as an attribute of Venus and a symbol of physical love. In cycles of the Labours of the Months, rabbits frequently appear in the spring months. In Francesco del Cossa's painting of April in the Palazzo Schifanoia in Ferrara, Italy, Venus' children, surrounded by a flock of white rabbits, symbolize love and fertility. In Italian Renaissance and Baroque art, rabbits are depicted more often than hares. In an allegory on lust by Pisanello, a naked woman lies on a couch with a rabbit at her feet. Pinturicchio's scene of Susanna in the Bath is displayed in the Vatican's Borgia Apartment. Here, each of the two old men are accompanied by a pair of hares or rabbits, clearly indicating wanton lust. In Piero di Cosimo's painting of Venus and Mars, a cupid resting on Venus clings to a white rabbit for similar reasons. Still lifes in Dutch Golden Age painting and their Flemish equivalents often included a moralizing element which was understood by their original viewers without assistance: fish and meat can allude to religious dietary precepts, fish indicating fasting while great piles of meat indicate voluptas carnis (lusts of the flesh), especially if lovers are also depicted. Rabbits and birds, perhaps in the company of carrots and other phallic symbols, were easily understood by contemporary viewers in the same sense. As small animals with fur, hares and rabbits allowed the artist to showcase his ability in painting this difficult material. Dead hares appear in the works of the earliest painter of still life collections of foodstuffs in a kitchen setting, Frans Snyders, and remain a common feature, very often sprawling hung up by a rear leg, in the works of Jan Fyt, Adriaen van Utrecht and many other specialists in the genre. By the end of the 17th century, the grander subgenre of the hunting trophy still life appeared, now set outdoors, as though at the back door of a palace or hunting lodge. Hares (but rarely rabbits) continued to feature in the works of the Dutch and Flemish originators of the genre, and later French painters like Jean-Baptiste Oudry.Talbot, William S., \\"Jean-Baptiste Oudry: Hare and Leg of Lamb\\", p. 150, The Bulletin of the Cleveland Museum of Art, Vol. 57, No. 5 (May, 1970), pp. 149-158 , Cleveland Museum of Art, JSTOR From the Middle Ages until modern times, the right to hunt was a vigorously defended privilege of the ruling classes. Hunting Still lifes, often in combination with hunting equipment, adorn the rooms of baroque palaces, indicating the rank and prestige of their owners. Jan Weenix' painting shows a still life reminiscent of a trophy case with birds and small game, fine fruits, a pet dog and a pet monkey, arranged in front of a classicising garden sculpture with the figure of Hercules and an opulent palace in the background. The wealth and luxurious lifestyle of the patron or owner is clearly shown. The children's tales of the English author Beatrix Potter, illustrated by herself, include several titles featuring the badly behaved Peter Rabbit and other rabbit characters, including her first and most successful book The Tale of Peter Rabbit (1902), followed by The Tale of Benjamin Bunny (1904), and The Tale of The Flopsy Bunnies (1909). Potter's anthropomorphic clothed rabbits are probably the most familiar artistic rabbits in the English-speaking world, no doubt influenced by illustrations by John Tenniel of the White Rabbit in Lewis Carroll's book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Joseph Beuys, who always finds a place for a rabbit in his works, sees it as symbolizing resurrection. In the context of his action \\"How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare\\", he stated that the rabbit \\"...has a direct relationship to birth... For me, the rabbit is the symbol of incarnation. Because the rabbit shows in reality what man can only show in his thoughts. He buries himself, he buries himself in a depression. He incarnates himself in the earth, and that alone is important.\\" Masquerade (book) (1979), written and illustrated by the artist Kit Williams, is ostensibly a children‚Äôs book, but contains elaborate clues to the location of a jewelled golden hare, also made by Williams, which he had buried at the location in England to which the clues in the book led. The hare was not found until 1982, in what later emerged as dubious circumstances. The Welsh sculptor Barry Flanagan (1944-2009) was best known for his energetic bronzes of hares, which he produced throughout his career. Many have a comic element, and the length and thinness of the hare's body is often exaggerated. = D√ºrer's Young Hare = Young Hare, by Albrecht D√ºrer (1502) Wolpertinger (2005), in the style of Albrecht D√ºrer Probably one of the most famous depictions of an animal in the history of European art is the painting Young Hare by Albrecht D√ºrer, completed in 1502 and now preserved in the Albertina in Vienna. D√ºrer's watercolor is seen in the context of his other nature studies, such as his almost equally famous Meadow or his Bird Wings. He chose to paint these in watercolor or gouache, striving for the highest possible precision and \\"realistic\\" representation. The hare pictured by D√ºrer probably does not have a symbolic meaning, but it does have an exceptional reception history. Reproductions of D√ºrer's Hare have often been a permanent component of bourgeois living rooms in Germany. The image has been printed in textbooks; published in countless reproductions; embossed in copper, wood or stone; represented three-dimensionally in plastic or plaster; encased in plexiglas; painted on ostrich eggs; printed on plastic bags; surreally distorted in Hasengiraffe (\\"Haregiraffe\\") by Martin Missfeldt; reproduced as a joke by Fluxus artists; and cast in gold; or sold cheaply in galleries and at art fairs Since early 2000, Ottmar H√∂rl has created several works based on D√ºrer's Hare, including a giant pink version. Sigmar Polke has also engaged with the hare on paper or textiles, or as part of his installations, and even in rubber band form. Dieter Roth's K√∂ttelkarnikel (\\"Turd Bunny\\") is a copy of D√ºrer's Hare made from rabbit droppings, and Klaus Staeck enclosed one in a little wooden box, with a cutout hole, so that it could look out and breathe. D√ºrer's Hare has even inspired a depiction of the mythological Wolpertinger.

The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange on September 20, 2018 under the ticker symbol EB.  History  Eventbrite was founded in 2006 by Kevin Hartz (Co- Founder and Executive Chairman) and Julia Hartz (Co-Founder and CEO) and Renaud Visage (Co-Founder and CTO). The company was the first major player in this market in the US. Prior to his position at the company, Kevin Hartz was involved with PayPal and was the Co-Founder and CEO of Xoom Corporation, an international money transfer company. Julia Hartz, wife of Kevin, was raised in Santa Cruz, CA. After studying broadcasting at Pepperdine University, she became a creative executive at FX Network in Los Angeles. Soon after the two became engaged, she moved to the Bay Area and helped co-found Eventbrite. On March 18, 2011 Eventbrite raised $50 million in Series E Financing led by Tiger Global. On April 22, 2013, Eventbrite raised another $60 million in growth capital financing led by Tiger Global, and including T.

In March 2017, Eventbrite purchased D.C.-based event tech startup Nvite for an undisclosed sum. On June 9, 2017 Eventbrite purchased Ticketfly from Pandora for $200 million. The acquisition was meant to strengthen Eventbrite's position in the live music market, but according to observers, executives were still struggling to integrate Ticketfly as of 2019. In April 2018, Eventbrite acquired the Spanish ticketing service Ticketea, citing its events discovery platform and \\"robust ecosystem of third-party integrations\\" as being advantageous. Later that month, Eventbrite was subjected to criticism over an update to its merchants' agreement, which specified that the service had the right to attend and record footage of any aspect of an event for any purpose, and that event organizers were \\"responsible for obtaining, at your own cost, all third party permissions, clearances, and licenses necessary to secure Eventbrite the permissions and rights [to do so].\\" Following public backlash, Eventbrite chose to remove the passage entirely. The company stated that it wanted the option to \\"work with individual organizers to secure video and photos at their events for marketing and promotional purposes\\", but admitted that the clauses were too broadly-worded. In August 2018, Picatic, a Vancouver-based ticketing and event registration platform, was acquired by Eventbrite. In April 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic which was causing a drastic drop in in-person events, Eventbrite laid off around 45% of its employees, which at that point numbered between 1,000 and 1,100.

The ship  The El Estero was built as a general cargo steamship for the Southern Pacific Steamship Lines at the Downey Shipbuilding Yard in Staten Island, New York and delivered for service in September 1920. The first of three sister ships built for the line, El Estero was operated by the Morgan Line in the Coastwise trade primarily between the ports of New York City, Baltimore and Galveston for much of her commercial service life. Acquired by the US Maritime Commission on June 10, 1941 as part of an effort to increase US-Flag merchant marine shipping capacity, El Estero was purchased from Southern Pacific and placed operation with United States Lines under a Panamanian registry. Pressed into service carrying war supplies from the United States to Europe during World War II, the ship made several Atlantic crossings in convoys which frequently came under U-Boat attack, including Convoy PQ 13 in March 1942. Continuing this duty into 1943, El Estero put into New York Harbor in early April 1943 where she waited her turn to load munitions at the long finger pier of the New York Port of Embarkation's Caven Point Terminal off Jersey City, New Jersey. The fire With loading completed on April 24, 1943, El Estero had taken on 1,365 tons of mixed munitions and was preparing to depart at approximately 5:30PM when a boiler flashback started a fire on oily water in her bilges which quickly grew out of control.\\"The El Estero Fire and How the US Coast Guard Helped Save New York Harbor\\" by William H. Thiesen, Sea History 126 , Spring 2009 Upper New York Bay with Caven Point Pier (thin white line in the center), where El Estero was moored when it caught fire. The initial report of fire aboard El Estero brought an immediate response of five fire trucks from the Jersey City Fire Department, two 30-foot fireboats and roughly 60 volunteers from the U.S. Coast Guard to battle and contain the flames aboard the ship, which was moored directly opposite two other fully loaded ammunition ships and two ammunition- laden consists of railroad boxcars. With over 5,000 tons of ammunition (comparable to a tactical nuclear weaponFormer Military Sites of New Jersey) now in immediate danger of being set off by the fire on El Estero and with memories of the Black Tom explosion fresh on the minds of many at the scene, fire fighting efforts began in earnest. It was quickly discovered that the location and intensity of the fire prevented access to the ships' seacocks, making any attempt at scuttling the ship impossible, and the call went out to the New York City Fire Department, which in turn dispatched its two most powerful fireboats; Fire Fighter and John J. Harvey, to the scene. Arriving at 6:30 pm and immediately running hoses up to Coast Guardsmen on the burning ship, the fireboats took positions directly alongside El Estero as a trio of commercial tugboats made up a towline to her bow and began pulling her off the Caven Point Pier towards open waters on through The Narrows. Despite the high probability of the ship's volatile cargo exploding at any moment, the Coast Guardsmen, fire fighters and tug crews continued their efforts to contain the fire on El Estero to save as much of the ship and cargo as possible, but shortly after the tow began the Port Admiral of New York Harbor ordered the ship sunk. Shifting to a shallow area of water near Robbins Reef Light in Upper New York Bay, the fireboats began pumping their combined maximum capacity of 38,000 gallons of water per minute into El Esteros cargo holds, which succeeded in swamping the ship and sent her to the bottom shortly after 9PM with much of her superstructure still above the surface. With all hotspots declared extinguished by 11:30PM on the 24th, the all-clear for residents and businesses ringing New York Harbor was transmitted over the radio and what is considered to have been the single greatest threat to New York City during World War II passed without major incident or loss of life.Time Ebbs for the Heroes Who Saved the Harbor, Clyde Haberman, New York Times, May 27, 2008 Aftermath With a shroud of secrecy soon in place over the events surrounding the sinking of El Estero due in large part to the then-classified mission of the Caven Point Army Depot, public knowledge of the near-disaster remained low until 1944 when the first of several awards for heroism were distributed to the first responders. El Estero herself would remain in her sunken state for the better part of four months before the still-loaded ship was finally raised from the seafloor and towed out of the harbor for use as a naval gunnery target. Her untimely end and its legacy are still very much visible today in the modern-day Sandy Hook Bay, where in August 1943 the US Navy began construction of a new ammunition depot in New Jersey, now known as Naval Weapons Station Earle which features a 2.9-mile pier designed to move the hazardous activity of loading and unloading munitions away from densely populated areas. Over half a century later, both the Fire Fighter and John J. Harvey, the latter then a museum ship, helped fight fires at Ground Zero in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks.

Incumbent president Jose Ramos-Horta, who was eligible for a second and final term as president, announced that he would seek nomination to be a candidate in the election. The election was seen as a test for the \\"young democracy\\" in seeking to take control of its own security. Former military commander Taur Matan Ruak provisionally beat Francisco Guterres in a second round runoff.  Background  The presidency is seen as a unifying post for the country after the 1999 East Timorese crisis. This election is also seen as a test FRETILIN's ability to take back control in the parliamentary election later in the year. Incumbent president Jose Ramos-Horta had initially been reluctant to run for re-election, but a draft movement collected over 120,000 signatures in favour of his candidacy, prompting him to run.  Candidates  There were finally twelve candidates running for president; two others eventually were excluded, one failing to meet the nomination requirements and another dying at the start of the election. *Ab√≠lio Ara√∫jo * Fernando de Ara√∫jo, speaker of the National Parliament of East Timor, president of the Democratic Party *Mar√≠a do C√©u *Lucas da Costa * Francisco Gomes * Francisco Guterres, FRETILIN * Jos√© Lu√≠s Guterres, vice prime minister, member of the Frente-Mudan√ßa * Jos√© Ramos-Horta, incumbent president * Rog√©rio Lobato *Angelita Pires * Taur Matan Ruak, also known as TMR, former commander of the FALINTIL-For√ßas de Defesa de Timor-Leste (F-FDTL), the Military of East Timor. He is an independent candidate, but supported by East Timor's second biggest party, the National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction, (CNRT) and its leader, Prime Minister Xanana Gusm√£o. *Manuel Tilman The candidacy of Angela Freitas, was rejected by the CNE due to the ineligibility of some of the signatures required. She then offered her support to FRETILIN's Francisco Guterres. One candidate Francisco Xavier do Amaral, a member of the National Parliament of East Timor and a leader of Timorese Social Democratic Association, died during the campaign, on 5 March 2012. A special plenary session of parliament amended the electoral so as not to restart the electoral process as mandated by the older law. The controversial move elicited protests. Campaign Economic issues were said to be the primary concern. According to the AFP, the most likely candidates were Jose Ramos-Horta, Francisco \\"Lu Olo\\" Guterres and Taur Matan Ruak. Ruak also said that he was confident of winning without a run-off. He won the backing of CNRT after it withdrew support for Ramos-Horta over criticism of the government; still, Ramos-Horta said he was not unhappy with the decision to support Ruak: \\"I'm very happy he's supporting one of my favourite candidates. If someone supports [Ruak] I'm happy because I admire [him].\\" Ruak was seen as likely to get some votes from FRETILIN's traditional base as he was popular with the party and repeatedly courted by the party hierarchy before opting to run as an independent after he quit his army post. However, there were also concerns of having someone affiliated to the army run for president because the army has sometimes disagreed with the police. Ruak campaigned wearing camouflage to highlight his role in the War of Independence. Ramos-Horta said before the election that \\"If I'm not elected, I have so many things to do - I have to struggle to choose what to do.\\" Xanana Gusm√£o campaigned for Ruak. Both Guitteres and Ruak said that they would abide by the outcome of the second round of the election. Ruak also said that he was proud to be Gusm√£o's deputy during the independence struggle. In the second round the Democratic Party and Ramos-Horta remained neutral.Kingsbury, Damien Monitors and electoral issues International observers were present from Australia, the European Union, Asian Network for Free Elections (ANFREL) and Lusophone states. On 2 March, the CNE held a meeting, led by its president, Faustino Cardoso Gomes, with an EU delegation based in the country to discuss issues pertaining to the election and its monitoring. The Timor-Leste Friendship Network/Deakin University Observer Mission was an Australian observer group. On 28 February, the National Electoral Commission (CNE) had organised a national initiative for the conduct of a peaceful election at the Dili Convention Centre. It was attended by traditional leaders from the 13 electoral districts and culminated in a pact being signed after a debate by the then 12 of 13 candidates (Francisco Xavier do Amaral did not attend the event due to ill health). On 5 March, the CNE held a meeting with the political parties and presidential candidates to explain issues and rules about the campaigning process, the roles of political parties' and candidates' agents and campaign finance issues. The president of state-owned Radio- Televis√£o Timor Leste (RTTL) Expedito also elucidated RTTL's role in covering the election. Amongst the attendees were representatives of all 13 political parties and six presidential candidates. The Deputy Secretary-General of UNMIT, Finn Reske-Nielson, said of the election that \\"we have seen a clean campaign that's been virtually free of violence. Every candidate has committed him or herself to peace.\\" If the election turned out as planned UNMIT could also leave the country at the end of the year as per its current mandate. Violence On 20 February, the offices of the CNE and the Technical Secretariat for Electoral Administration were firebombed at about 3:00 in the national capital of Dili. The attack also damaged a UNMIT vehicle. Australia's Sky News also suggested that witnesses had reported seeing serving members of the military campaign for Ruak amid what it said were fears of voter intimidation. However, Ramos-Horta said that he is \\"completely reassured about security. Our police and the United Nations police are alert all over the country. They have tremendous experience over the years in assessing the situation, in pre-empting any security threats so I am very confident it will be okay.\\" However, Indonesia's ambassador, Eddy Setyabudi, said that the government of Indonesia was making contingency plans to evacuate 7,540 Indonesians from the country if the situation worsens and riots occur, following a meeting of the Indonesian-East Timor Border Coordination committee. On 13 April, just before the second round, about 100 people were reported to have pelted Ruak's campaign headquarters with stones. More violence was reported over the burning of the homes of two \\"political supporters\\" and several campaign vehicles. National Police (PNTL) deputy commander Alfonso de Jesus said that due to the presence of police untoward incidents were not serious: \\"We had six police officers there but [if] straight away they are not respecting the police presence there then the group is using the opportunity to take stones and throw them at the office.\\" Results Candidates' majority in districts (first round) Candidates' majority in districts (second round) About 620,000 people out of a population of 1,100,000 are able to vote. There are 13 electoral districts in the country. Voting took place between 7:00 and 15:00 with no reports of untoward incidents. In at least one polling station that was monitored, the attendants unsealed the ballots delivered under United Nations Police protection. A high voter turnout was also recorded with some polling stations needing to use their reserve ballots. Ermenegildo Lopes, the leader of the Bloku Ploklamador, said that his party's representatives indicated that no one would cross the 50% threshold to avoid a run-off. The AFP also said the election was \\"remarkably organised\\" in contrast to the pre-election violence in 2006. Ramos-Horta said of the election that \\"there has not been a single incidence of violence\\" and that he continues to believe the country is already ready to take control of its security. The preliminary hand-counted result, broadcast live on RTTL, of over 70% of the votes indicated that Francisco Guterres was leading with 27.28% of the votes, followed by Taur Matan Ruak with 24.17% of the votes and incumbent president Jose Ramos-Horta followed with 19.43% of the votes (though Amaral had died, his name was still on the result notification issued by the election commission). Provisional results for the second round were scheduled to be announced within 48 hours of the polls closing, though they were announced a day earlier. Though the final result had to be certified by the Court of Appeals, Ruak had got 61.23% of the votes. Turnout was 72.1%. Reactions Ramos-Horta said that he had no disappointment over the result and that both the leaders were capable enough of ensuring peace and stability, which was his primary concern. He also conceded defeat and added: \\"On the stroke of midnight on May 19 I will hand over leadership of the country to the new president, one of the two who are now going for a second round.\\" Ruak's spokesman Fidelis Magalh√£es said after the second round that \\"we are very much elevated by the result, by the current outcome. We expect to see some changes [in the final count], minor, probably one or two percentage points, but without a clear swing or fluctuation of points.\\" Ameerah Haq, the UN secretary-general's special representative for East Timor, was reported to have said that if the presidential and parliamentary elections go off without incidents the UNMIT would leave the country. Analysis Al Jazeera suggested that a win for Ruak would adversely effect FRETILIN's position in the parliamentary election by showing support for Gusm√£o's incumbent coalition. The Australian suggested that the voting patterns were indicative of a tough negotiation process, after the parliamentary election, to form a government, even harder than the previous appointment of Xanana Gusm√£o after the 2006 East Timorese crisis. It pointed to the 2007 election in indicating that Ramos-Horta and Taur Matan Ruak's current performance, if seen as proxy CNRT candidates, showed a strengthening of voted by two or three percentage points. However, though, in the previous election Guiterres was unable to get more than three percent in between the two rounds signifying an inability to get third-party votes, in this election he gained 10 percent and the support of two minor parties. It also quoted the co-ordinator of the Timor-Leste Friendship Network/Deakin University Observer Mission Damien Kingsbury as saying Gusm√£o would be happier with the result than FRETILIN's leader Mari Alkatiri, who seeks to become prime minister again. To further complicate the government formation later in the year, The Australian also suggested that Fernando de Araujo's Democratic Party, which is a part of the coalition, is hindered by the poor relationship with Gusm√£o and that the Timorese Social Democratic Association has factionalised since the death of Amaral. The Sydney Morning Herald attributed the result to personality politics. Analysing the voter returns, it suggested that supporters of the Democratic Party or Ramos-Horta voted for CNRT and sent a message to the party that it could lose its support base if it allied with FRETILIN. It similarly pointed out that while FRETILIN can consistently turn out plurality support, it is unable to gather majority support and that if FRETILIN had got a majority it would claim that Section 106 of the constitution the president would be obligated to choose a new prime minister from parliamentary support. The newspaper also said that compared to the previous election this one was \\"remarkably calm\\" with \\"few relatively minor disturbances compared.\\" References Category:Presidential elections in East Timor East Timor Presidential election ","title":"2012 East Timorese presidential election"},{"id":"33064248","text":"Cedar Run may refer to the following: *Cedar Run (Missouri), a tributary of the Big River *Cedar Run, Pennsylvania, an unincorporated community in Lycoming County *Cedar Run (Pennsylvania), a tributary of Pine Creek *Cedar Run (Occoquan River), in Virginia, a tributary of the Occoquan River *Cedar Run, New Jersey, an unincorporated community in Ocean County See also * ","title":"Cedar Run"},{"id":"33064257","title":"Super Star (2002 film)"},{"id":"33064263","text":"Umueshi is a community in Ideato South Local Government Area in Imo State, Nigeria.

He was the sole surviving Jew in the Shoah from Haltern am See. The Alexander-Lebenstein junior high school in his hometown is named after him.  Life  = Childhood = He was born on November 3, 1927, at the family home Disselhof 36 in Haltern and experienced in his own words, a sheltered childhood until age 11. His mother, Lottie Joseph from Jever, Oldenburg, and his father, Nathan Lebenstein, operated cattle trade and kosher and non-kosher butcher shop. His father had served in World War I for the German army. Alexander had three older sisters; one of them died in 1932, the other two emigrated in 1939 in the United States. = National Socialism = During Kristallnacht in 1938 his family was hiding; shortly after Lebenstein and his family were brought to a Jewish house in Haltern. In January 1942 they came to the warehouse (former exhibition hall on the \\"Wildenbruchplatz\\") to Gelsenkirchen. From there they were deported to Riga, where his father fell seriously ill and was soon killed by SS troops. In spring of 1942 he became separated from his mother and shipped to Lithuania. When he returned in the fall, his mother was gone. After the war, he found out that she had been shot in a forest near Riga, and was buried.Haltern ist jetzt offiziell Mitglied des Riga-Komitees, Halterner Zeitung, 27. Januar 2010 After that Lebenstein was in several labor camps and was finally brought with a ferry to the Stutthof concentration camp in Gda≈Ñsk. When in 1945 the Russians liberated the camp, he was sent in a hospital in Gda≈Ñsk because of his bad health condition. He fled with two men via Frankfurt (Oder) to Berlin, because they refused to join the Red Army. They were not welcome even by the Americans because the Russians had been looking after them. This is why Lebenstein went back to his birthplace Haltern, where he was compelled to leave the city again. He was denied German citizenship and came to Deggendorf (Bavaria) in a DP camp. = Emigration to the USA = There, everyone wanted to emigrate to Israel, but his sister (who had already emigrated in 1939) advised him to come to her to the United States. In January 1947 he came to Richmond, Virginia. Here too, no one wanted anything to do with him, because it was said: \\"A boy who has survived several concentration camps ‚Äì that does not exist!\\". For this reason he moved to New York where he opened a supermarket. He married in 1948 and had two sons. Working memory In 1994 Lebenstein flew back to Germany for the first time. Two students from Haltern had written him a letter saying that they just learned about the Holocaust in the classroom. After initially rejecting their offer, he was convinced by his family to come to his German hometown. This visit completely changed the life of Alexander Lebenstein and soon after he started publicly speaking ‚Äì in churches, schools, libraries and at the Virginia Holocaust Museum ‚Äì about his life and his terrible experiences. The cattle car in front of the Virginia Holocaust Museum is a place for quiet remembrance. Erwin Kirschenbaum, a German schoolmate of Lebenstein's provided the cattle car as part of a school project. In order for his tireless memorial work to be continued even after death, he founded the ‚ÄúAlexander Lebenstein Fund for Tolerance and Human Rights\\".

The block to the south of Folger Park was the original site of Providence Hospital. The hospital was founded in 1861 by the Daughters of Charity. They originally rented a house at the corner of Second and D Streets, but soon acquired the entire block. In 1864 President Abraham Lincoln signed an Act of Congress authorizing funds for the construction of a five-story brick Second Empire-style building with Italianate features. In 1904 the building was expanded to four times its original capacity and remodeled into a Mission style, including the 175-foot bell tower, according to the design of architect Waddy Butler Wood. With the hospital dominating the area, Folger Park was originally known as Providence Hospital Square or the Square North of Providence Hospital. The hospital had deteriorated by 1947 and rather than shut down for a two-year remodel, in March 1956 the trustees relocated the hospital to its current 36-acre site at 1150 Varnum St. NE, near Catholic University. The Hospital building was demolished in 1964.

It seems likely that Alberto Mazzucato, who served as a music director at the Conservatorio, was one of his teachers, who had encouraged him to stage one of his first operas.Christina Vergadou-Mavroudaki doiserbia.nb.rs website [page 58] According to Motsenigos, Rodotheatos also studied for seven years at the Conservatorio di Musica San Pietro a Majella in Naples between 1864 and 1871,as did many students including Cavaliere Nikolaos Mantzaros.Ekaterini Romanou doiserbia.nb.rs website Retrieved 2011-09-12 In 1875 Rodotheatos went again to Corfu, where he taught counterpoint and harmony, brought out works of almost all genera and in the same year became a Member of the Board and Vice Director of the musical department 'of the Teatro San Giacomo of Corfu'. His works were played in Athens and Italy. Due to mental illness, he was placed in the lunatic asylum of Corfu, where he died in 1892. Except for the three symphonic works most of his compositions have been lost. Apart from works for piano and choral music he wrote some Italian language operatic and symphonic music. There are also numerous marches and other works for wind band.

Tough luck. - The Washington Post - https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2014/12/02/dont-want-a-federal- monument-in-your-neighborhood-park-tough-luck/ History Marion Park was first established as open ground, dating back to the original plans for the city created by Pierre L'Enfant in 1791. Also included in updated plans from Andrew Ellicott, this reservation has served continuously as a park since its first improvements in 1885. It is one of the larger parks in the Capitol Hill area. In 1764 the tract of land was known as Houp's Addition, and was owned by Jonathan Slater. In 1791, Mr. Slater sold the tract to William Prout, who then had to turn over the land to the federal government soon after. Improvements were made by 1886 which gave the park an ornamental elegance in the developing neighborhood. A large vase in the center of the park was filled with tropical flowers every summer. This \\"Large Hilton Iron Vase\\" was used to direct the flow of traffic through the park through the carriage paths. In 1963, the vase was removed, and the traffic patterns were redirected outside of the boundaries of Marion Park. A statue to Francis Marion was authorized on May 8, 2008. However it was met with opposition by some local residents. It was argued that they were not consulted by the federal government on the placement of the statue in a DC park. In addition the figure of Francis Marion is controversial as he fought Native Americans and was a slave owner. Uses The park has a playground, and is a popular place to bring dogs.

Overview Cook is the author of many short stories and two noted fiction books, Robbers and Screen Door Jesus & Other Stories. He was chosen by Barnes & Noble as part of its Discover Great New Writers program in 2001. His books are available in foreign editions, and his stories have been included in anthologies such as Houghton Mifflin's The Best American Mystery Stories 2003. His memoir essay ‚ÄúFull Moon Over Bohemia,‚Äù set in the Czech Republic, was selected for The Best Travel Writing anthology in 2006. In 2011, he announced he would begin publishing his fiction exclusively in digital format as e-books. His first e-book release under that plan was his novella Storm. He has also placed his previous books online as e-books. The feature movie Screen Door Jesus, based on Cook‚Äôs story collection of the same name, was released in 2003. The movie received film festival awards in the U.S. in several categories, including for best cinematography, best original score, and best feature film. His novel Robbers has been under option for film and TV for the past decade by independent filmmakers and by studios, including Sony and CBS, but has yet to reach fruition in the screen medium. Biography A native of Texas, Cook grew up in Port Neches, a small town east of Houston near the Texas-Louisiana border, an ethnically and culturally diverse region characterized by the East Texas forests to the north, the Gulf Coast beaches and marshlands to the south, and the cypress swamps of Cajun Louisiana to the east. This unique geographic region ‚Äì part of the American South in culture and language ‚Äì has figured largely in Cook‚Äôs writing. Also figuring in his work, especially the short fiction, is the charismatic, fundamentalist Pentecostalism of his family when he was growing up. He embraced those religious beliefs as an adolescent and planned to become a Pentecostal preacher. During his high school years, however, Cook began to question the dogmas and beliefs of that sect and eventually left it altogether. He explored this cultural and religious terrain in depth in his story collection Screen Door Jesus & Other Stories. Cook studied psychology and pre-medicine, with minor focus on philosophy and religion, at Rice University in Houston, Texas, and Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, where he took his B.A. degree in 1976. He subsequently began free-lancing for the Minneapolis Star newspaper and decided to pursue a career in journalism. Professional career In 1979, Cook left the Minneapolis Star to become the crime reporter for the Birmingham Post-Herald in Alabama. He later worked for daily newspapers in Georgia and Texas, where he was recognized by the Texas Press Association with awards for feature column writing and for reporting. In the late 1980s, Cook left journalism to work for the John Gray Institute, a Texas-based non-profit ‚Äúthink tank‚Äù focused on a variety of public policy issues, including labor-management relations, economic development, and environmental regulation and reform. He left the institute to work as a speechwriter for former U.S. Secretary of Labor William Usery, Jr., in Washington, D.C. He later returned to Texas and in 1989 entered the University of Texas School of Law, at the same time serving as Communications Director of the Texas AFL-CIO. In 1994, Cook moved to Paris, France, where he worked first in the European Office of the AFL-CIO, then later for a public sector trade union organization based near Geneva. It was during this period that he began to write fiction more seriously. In 1995, his short story ‚ÄúThe Pickpocket‚Äù won first prize in the annual literary competition co-sponsored by Sorbonne University and Paris Transcontinental magazine. In 1996, he moved to San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, to pursue writing narrative fiction full-time. It was there he wrote his first published novel, Robbers. It was rejected by almost 40 publishers in the U.S. After it was purchased by publishers Payot Rivages in France and No Exit in the UK, the U.S. publisher Carroll & Graf (now part of The Perseus Books Group) bought it for publication in 2000. The New York Times called Robbers ‚Äúa novel with classic noir bones‚Äù and observed Cook‚Äôs writing style showed ‚Äúfearless originality, in a lyric voice that sings itself raw.\\" Robbers has been translated into a number of foreign editions, including its award-winning French edition Voleurs with Pierre Bondil as translator. Cook‚Äôs second book, Screen Door Jesus & Other Stories, was a finalist for the Texas Institute of Letters Jesse H. Jones Fiction Award in 2001. He moved to Prague, Czech Republic that same year, where he began writing screenplays. After a two-year hiatus during which he studied guitar, Cook returned to writing screenplays and narrative fiction. In summer 2011, he released the novellas Storm and Cloven Tongues of Fire, as well as the story collection Tiger Ridge ‚Äì Three Stories and the bilingual (French-English) story \\"The Pickpocket\\". All those publications are e-books. Cook is working on another novel. Personal life Cook was a single parent from 1985 until 1994. His daughter, Athena Gerbsch- Cook, and grandson Asa Christopher, reside in the United States. Cook is married to Czech artist and poet Katerina Pinosova. They live in Prague, Czech Republic, and San Miguel de Allende, Mexico.

History In 1939, Copland wrote incidental music for the play Quiet City by Irwin Shaw. He later worked some of it into a ten-minute composition designed to be performed independently of the play. The piece premiered on January 28, 1941, by conductor Daniel Saidenberg and his Saidenberg Little Symphony in New York City. The original score for the play was composed for trumpet, alto saxophone, B clarinet (doubling bass clarinet), and piano. According to Copland, the piece was \\"an attempt to mirror the troubled main character of Irwin Shaw's play\\", who had abandoned his Jewishness and his poetic aspirations in order to pursue material success by Anglicizing his name, marrying a rich socialite, and becoming the president of a department store. The man, however, was continually recalled to his conscience by the haunting sound of his brother's trumpet playing. Continuing the assessment in his own autobiography, Copland observed that \\"Quiet City seems to have become a musical entity, superseding the original reasons for its composition,\\" owing much of its success to its escape from the details of its dramatic context.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Accrington, the archdeaconry of Blackburn, and the diocese of Blackburn. Its benefice has been united with that of All Saints, Clayton-le-Moors. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History The church was founded in 1140, and was dedicated to Saint Mary. The earliest fabric in the present church dates from the 15th and 16th centuries. The tower was built in 1859, when the chancel was rebuilt; these and other alterations were made by Thomas Hacking. In 1881 a chapel was rebuilt by the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin. Architecture =Exterior= St James' Church is constructed in sandstone rubble, and has a stone slate roof. Its plan consists of a three-bay nave, north and south aisles, a south porch, a two-bay chancel, and a west tower. The tower is short and is in three stages; its architectural style is Perpendicular. It has an arched west doorway with a two-light window above it, two-light bell openings, and a battlemented parapet. All the windows on the sides of the church are round-headed with three lights. The south porch is gabled, and incorporates part of a Norman font in one of its side benches. In 2008 the Norman font was removed from the south porch and is displayed inside the church. The design of the font, comprising eight vertical pallisters, hidden since 1512, but now revealed, opens the suggestion that its origin may be Saxon. =Interior= Inside the church is a shallow west gallery. The arcades are carried on octagonal piers and have round arches. In the north wall of the chancel is a late-medieval piscina. In its south wall is the re-sited tympanum of a Norman door. The octagonal font was given to the church by the abbot of Whalley Abbey, and contains panels carved with the Instruments of the Passion. The church contains four 19th-century hatchments, and memorial wall tablets dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. It also box pews dating from 1859. There is a stained glass window in the southeast aisle dating from the middle of the 19th century by Hardman & Co. In the northeast aisle is a window by Shrigley and Hunt dating from the early 20th century. The two-manual organ was built in about 1859 by John Laycock. It has been awarded a Historic Organ Certificate. External features The churchyard contains the war graves of three British soldiers of World War I, and a Canadian seaman of World War II.

Is that the sound of the nation switching off its sets?\\". independent.co.uk, 06 April 2008. Retrieved 15 march 2014.  Personality and appearance  Fuckwitt's regrettable flaw is that he continuously mistakes situations, objects and people for things they are not. He is cross-eyed and has wirey black hair in a style resembling dreadlocks, and wears outdated 70s platform shoes. Due to the swearword in his name, the comic never prints it in its entirety on the front page, often obscuring it with another graphic element, or else spoonerising it to \\"Wuckfitt\\". He lives with his parents, both of whom despair at his stupidity, and often make unsuccessful attempts to get rid of him. In one strip he responds to an employment advert that states, \\"Cunt Wanted\\". Upon realising that he has done something stupid, Terrence usually exclaims, correctly, that he has \\"shit for brains\\".  Typical story  The first frame of a Terry Fuckwitt strip will often have him cheerfully greeting the readers, saying he is doing some activity, only for the second frame to reveal that he is in totally the wrong place. For example, in one strip he appears to be getting married, but it is revealed that he is not in a church, but in a nuclear power plant, and that his bride is a rod of uranium. Fuckwitt's surreal misunderstandings are sometimes extended in multiple directions, or even circularly. Fuckwitt may be chastised by another character for being in the wrong place, and that character may later themselves be revealed to be someone completely different based on a misunderstanding of the first character, making it apparent that in fact Fuckwitt's initial impression was correct. These \\"facts\\" then may be completely reversed in a surprise reveal in the next frame, and so forth. Fuckwitt sometimes interacts with other Viz characters, such as when he was informed that he was not in fact Terry Fuckwitt at all, but rather Billy the Fish in disguise. The remainder of the strip became a Billy the Fish story. In one early strip, Fuckwitt forgets to turn up for his own comic strip, appearing in the last frame asking if he was too late. The rest of the cartoon followed a \\"Meanwhile, next door ...\\" scenario, following The Bacon family. The strip also features extremely bizarre occurrences. One cartoon played on the use of perspective in art, with Terry forgetting to grow larger as he moved from the background into the foreground. One other cartoon had Terry's father telling Terry to get out of his sight, warning his son that should he see him again that day, he would kick his face in. Although Terry attempts to keep out of sight, Terry's father sees him on TV and subsequently kicks him in the face through the television. How this was achieved and how the two characters were able to talk to one another is not explained.  Notes   References  Bibliography * Donald, C.

Google Catalogs delivered virtual catalogs to users from merchants like Nordstrom, L.L. Bean, Macy's, Pottery Barn, and many more. Merchants were added through a process by which they submitted a form with information and a sample of their catalog, which was then reviewed by Google‚Äôs editorial team. The application was noted as a \\"Greener Way to Shop\\", as the digitization of catalogs substituted for paper versions. Google announced the intent to discontinue the iPad app effective August 2013 and eventually shut down the project entirely in August 2015.  History  Google Catalog search was first conceptualized in December, 2001 as a search function on the web only. This was a free Google service. Catalog search was a major digitization project for Google, as thousands of merchant catalogs were scanned and made accessible to the public. Users were able to flip through pages of catalogs from a variety of industries, except those that focus on liquor, tobacco, firearms, or similar products. Google ended this service on the web in January, 2009 stating: \\"Catalog Search hasn‚Äôt been as popular as some of our other products. So tomorrow, we‚Äôre bidding it a fond farewell and focusing our efforts to bring more and more types of offline information such as magazines, newspapers and of course, books, online\\". On August 16, 2011 Google Catalogs was announced on Google's official blog, and was immediately available for download. Google created a short video as an overview of the features of the product. On October 1, 2012, Google made Google Catalogs available on the web.  User experience (UX)  The catalogs available on this application were grouped by several product categories, including Women‚Äôs Fashion and Apparel, Jewelry, Beauty, Home, Men‚Äôs Fashion and Apparel, Kids and Baby, and Gifts. After choosing a product category, users could select a specific catalog, which then brought them to the cover page of that catalog. Shoppers using the iPad could flip through the catalog and tap on \\"hotspots\\" for the products in which they are interested, linking to the merchant's Web site for purchase. After clicking on a product of interest, a pop-up will appear for the user to read more about the product, which includes price, description, images, and title. This is also the page where users could send information about the product to others via email. For those who didn‚Äôt want to purchase online, store locations can be found by loading the 'Find Nearby' option. Further exploration of the products was supported by features such as the ability to zoom in on products as well as being able to view tags to garner additional information. In addition, products could be marked as favorites, and then all of those that were previously marked could be viewed on the same page by clicking the Favorites button on the bottom of the screen. Users could also mark specific catalogs as Favorites in order to receive a notification when a new issue was available. If a user was looking for a specific product, there was a search function that showed all the products related to the keyword that the user types in.  User interaction  In the early stages of this Google product, users had the ability to send product information and images they find on the application to any person with an email address, regardless of whether or not they have the app. Users were also able to create collages of their favorite products across catalogs on their Android powered tablets or iPads. Once users had either created a collage they could share these with friends, in the same way they could share product information and images that they found interesting. In addition to this, users can create public collages that can be viewed by anyone with the application.  Platforms  Google Catalogs was once accessible on desktops, Android, and iOS. It was shut down in August 2015.  Monetization  Participating merchants did not have to pay a fee in order to have their catalogs included in this app. Additionally, users of Google Catalogs did not have to pay to search through the collection of catalogs that are provided in the app. Users did, however, have to have a Gmail account in order to sign-in and save their favorite catalogs in the mobile/tablet apps.

It is the third game in the We Ski series. Up to four players can compete against each other in over 50 sport-based minigames that take place in four fictional island resorts. Minigames range from outdoor activities such as kayaking and horseback riding, to activities one might find in a city, like table hockey and minigolf. Different resorts can be accessed using vehicles such as trolleys and bicycles. Players can customize the outfit of their avatar and decorate their house with furniture. The game's development began in 2009 and lasted two and a half years. It was first announced at the 2011 Electronic Entertainment Expo as an entry in the We Ski series; the game was released later that year for the Wii. The game was ported to the Nintendo Switch in 2018 and included new features such as the ability to take photographs. Surveys were held in America, Europe, and Japan to determine which sports and activities should be included in the minigames. Although the resorts were not directly based on real-life locations, producer Kobayashi said Hawaii was a possible influence for the Marine Resort. Go Vacation had a mixed reception; critics praised its multiplayer aspects and creativity but criticized its soundtrack, environments, controls, and the quality of the minigames. It was the third-best-selling game in Japan the week of its release, selling 47,209 copies.  Gameplay  split screen view of four players having a water gun fight Go Vacation is a party and sports video game. Players explore four resorts located on the fictional Kawawii Island: Marine, City, Mountain, and Snow. They start the game in the Marine Resort. More than 50 activities, both competitive and co-operative, are available on the island. These include bungee jumping, ice fishing, scuba diving, miniature golf, tennis, off-road racing, and snowman building. Some minigames require or allow for the use of different controllers and accessories, such as MotionPlus controller or the Balance Board. Winning some minigames unlocks more challenging modes. The island can be navigated at the player's leisure by walking or riding on vehicles, the type of which depends on the resort, and each resort also has certain places where players can fast travel to. In the Switch version, players are able to find and take photographs of animals that are scattered across the resorts, and find boxes with rewards in them. The Marine Resort, which contains coves and beaches, is themed around watersports, including beach volleyball, surfing, water gun battles, and Marine bike races. The City Resort, which centers around extreme and leisure sports, is the second and smallest resort. It hosts games such as table hockey, pie-throwing, skating, and minigolf. Players can use skateboards found throughout the resort to ride on skating rails. The third resort, the Snow Resort, focuses on winter sports like ski jumping, snow tubing, snowboarding, snowmobiling, and snowball fighting. The final resort is the Mountain Resort, where players can partake in outdoor activities. It includes forests and locations for rafting, kayaking, exploring, off-road car racing, and horseback riding. It also contains a lake and a shooting park. Go Vacation can be played using a Mii or one of 284 avatars divided into eight categories such as \\"Grandmother\\", \\"Grandfather\\", \\"Boy\\", and \\"Girl\\". Treasure chests containing outfits for the players' avatars are scattered around the resorts. Players can create a virtual dog and a non-player character (NPC) to accompany them as they explore the resorts which, with some exceptions, cannot participate in minigames. Up to four players can play together through local multiplayer. Occasionally, NPCs may ask players to embark upon a small quest, such as getting an item and taking back to them. After playing 20 minigames, players gains access to their own virtual houses, called villas, which can be decorated with furniture or photographs taken during the game. Furniture can be found in the game's world or unlocked using \\"silver keys\\" that are obtained after completing minigame goals. Furniture is gained in sets, of which there are 90. Players can alter the exterior of their villas using \\"gold keys\\", earned by completing challenges. Development Go Vacation was announced at the 2011 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) as the third entry in the We Ski series. Namco Bandai Games began development of the game in 2009, shortly after the release of We Ski & Snowboard because the developers felt they had not given players a \\"complete sense\\" of winter in the previous game. When discussing ways to address this, the developers decided winter alone was not enough; they wanted to depict other seasons. Producer Kenya Kobayashi wanted the game to focus on the experience of going on a resort holiday, rather than strictly focusing on the minigames themselves. Part of the game's development was outsourced to other companies; the rest was done by Namco Bandai Games staff who had previously worked on the Ridge Racer series. After realizing the word \\"vacation\\" is frequently associated with relaxation, Kenya Kobayashi named the game Go Vacation to clarify that it is a game in which you must be active. The resorts were not directly based on any real-life locations, although Kobayashi said the Marine Resort \\"might be inspired by things you find in Hawaii\\". The developers conducted surveys in America, Europe, and Japan to determine what activities to include in the game. The development team included 50 minigames in Go Vacation because most of the game's contemporaries included only 10 to 15 minigames. Developing the controls for the game's vehicles felt like \\"second nature\\" to the development team due to their experience on the Ridge Racer series. Go Vacation was first released for the Wii in 2011, however the exact date of release vary depending on region. It released on 11 October in North America, 20 October in Japan, 4 November in Europe, and 17 November in Australia. It was later ported to the Switch. The port released on 27 July 2018 in all regions except for Japan, where it was released on 27 December. The soundtrack of Go Vacation consists of instrumental and vocal tracks from composers, musicians, and vocal artists, including Taku Inoue, Norihiko Hibino, Aubrey Ashburn, and Jody Whitesides. On 21 December 2012, Japanese record label Sweep Records released the officially licensed album Namco Music Saloon, which includes live instrumentation and vocals. The album consists of original arrangements of songs from other Bandai Namco Entertainment titles, including Ridge Racer, Dig Dug, Pac-Man, New Rally-X, and Kotoba no Puzzle: Mojipittan. The album was released on iTunes on 23 March 2013. Reception Go Vacation received a mixed reception from critics; both versions of the game received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic. Andy Robertson of Wired stated the game was one of his \\"go-to family gaming suggestions\\", calling it \\"a real treat\\". Jim Sterling, writing for Destructoid, argued that \\"to call it bad would be unfair, but to call it anything better would give it more credit than it deserves\\". The Wii version of Go Vacation was the third-best-selling game in Japan during its first week, selling 47,209 copies, behind both Macross F: The Wings of Goodbye Hybrid Pack and Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Impact. The controls of the Wii version received a mixed reception but those of the Switch were praised. Of the Wii version, IGN's Audrey Drake said, \\"from Marine bikes to roller blades to horses, traversing the island proves engaging in its own right\\". Sterling took issue with the need to plug and unplug the Nunchuk controllers on the Wii version when swapping between minigames. Nintendo Power's Cody M. said that while exploring the game's open world can be a \\"joy\\", but that the motion controls were \\"awkward\\" and could cause players attempting to move forward to accidentally change their direction. Mark Reece of Nintendo Life said the minigames were not fun to play due to \\"a poorly conceived or unintuitive control scheme\\". Reviewing the Switch version, Daan Koopman of Nintendo World Report noted that the controls are one of the \\"biggest improvements over the original\\". Alessandra Borgonovo of IGN Italia praised the controls for the roller skates, saying that they were fun to use. On the game's minigames, critics were mostly negative. In his review of the Wii version, Sterling called them \\"tepid and shallow\\". Reviewing the Switch version, Koopman criticized the game for not properly informing the player that more activities and modes can be accessed in the individual minigames after the first playthrough of said minigame. Nintendo Life's Ryan Craddock felt that they are \\"an undercooked version of things we've seen countless times before.\\" 's praised the amount of minigames available, saying that the proverb of \\"quality over quantity\\" might have lost its meaning with Go Vacation. Reviewing the Wii version, Chris Watters, a writer for GameSpot, was mostly positive about the minigames, saying that \\"most are decent\\", but that some had succumbed to an \\"awkward camera\\" or \\"unresponsive controls\\". According to Reece, the game's music is \\"irritating and forgettable in equal measure\\", and the Wii version's opening theme would \\"more than likely awaken a strong desire to gouge out your own eardrums\\". In reviewing the game's soundtrack, Don Kotowski said the vocals in some of the music are \\"cheesy\\" and tend to \\"be a huge distraction that really hampers my enjoyment of the album\\". He praised the songs \\"Starry Ocean\\" and \\" Break\\" for their \\"nice island vibe\\" and said it was \\"quite impressive to see how Hibino has elaborated on the simple originals to produce fully-fledged arrangements\\". Watters criticized one aspect of villas; he said the game does not properly communicate to players how to gain silver and gold keys, which are used to customize villas. Some reviewers, however, praised the customizable villas; Craddock, in his review of the Switch version, compared them to the house customization mechanics of the Animal Crossing series. According to Drake, the game's island is \\"where everyone but yourself is actually a robot\\", referring to a lack of interaction with NPCs. Sterling criticized the NPCs for their design, calling them \\"faux anime characters\\" and \\"completely charmless\\". Reece also took issue with the NPCs, writing, \\"even if you hop onto an ATV and plough into someone at full speed, they'll have very little to say for themselves when they get back on their feet\\".

He was not related to Al Schacht, the former pitcher and coach known as \\"the Clown Prince of Baseball.\\" Baseball career Schacht did not begin his professional baseball career until 1947, when he was 29 years old. He signed with the minor league Stamford Bombers of the Class B Colonial League. Then living in The Bronx and caring for his ailing mother,Horvitz, Peter S., and Horvitz, Joachim, The Big Book of Jewish Baseball. New York: S.P.I. Books, 2001, page 163 Schacht commuted 25 miles (40 km) one-way to pitch for the Bombers, and won 18 of 25 decisions with a sparkling 2.94 earned run average. The following year, Schacht dropped his ERA to 2.09, although he went only 7‚Äì8. His contract was then acquired by the Boston Red Sox, where in 1949 he compiled a 20‚Äì5 record in a season split between the Class A Eastern League and the Double-A Southern Association‚Äì19 of those victories coming in the EL for the Scranton Red Sox. At year's end, he was selected by the Browns in the 1949 Rule 5 draft. He made the Browns' roster out of spring training and worked in eight big-league games during the season's early months. His only starting pitcher assignment came May 29 against another second-division club, the Chicago White Sox, and Schacht retired only two batters, allowing three hits, two bases on balls and four earned runs.1950-5-29 box score from Retrosheet He also was hit hard in relief appearances by the eventual world champion New York Yankees and first-division Red Sox. Schacht was then optioned to the Triple-A Kansas City Blues, where he pitched effectively despite a losing record. In , he again began the year on the Browns' 28-man roster, and earned his only MLB save on April 29 against the Cleveland Indians. However, Schacht was ineffective in three of his five appearances. He was placed on waivers when the rosters were cut to 25 men in mid-May and picked up by the National League Boston Braves. In six games for Boston during May and June, all in relief, Schacht allowed only one earned run, but earned two losses and then was optioned to the Triple-A Milwaukee Brewers. He went 4‚Äì1 for the minor-league Brewers, but retired from the game at age 33, after five professional seasons. In 21‚Öì innings pitched in Major League Baseball, Schacht allowed 44 hits, 21 bases on balls (compiling a WHIP of 3.047) and 34 earned runs, with 12 strikeouts and an earned run average of 14.34.

Sabotage attempt According to Colonel Hamid Hassy, 15 people working at the oil terminal in Ra's Lanuf acted as arsonists, setting fire to the oil facility. They clashed with anti-Gaddafi security forces, and five were killed while the rest were arrested, Hasi said. The New York Times was unable to confirm this series of events, which was initially reported by the Associated Press. Hit-and-run raid Fadl-Allah Haroun, another anti-Gaddafi commander, reported that a convoy of up to 40 vehicles, reportedly flying the tricolour flag to appear friendly, apparently moving out of a refugee camp 30 km south of Ra's Lanuf attacked the port. He said that 10 pro-Gaddafi attackers were killed in the ensuing shootout, and the pro-Gaddafi forces were forced to retreat. A refinery worker's story differed slightly, saying 14 or 15 trucks carrying pro-Gaddafi fighters had come from the west, perhaps from the loyalist stronghold of Sirte, and attacked the refinery as its 60 staff members slept. There was also no mention of casualties among the attacking force. The fighting reportedly was heaviest around the administration building, with rocket attacks being launched against the refinery, but much of the complex was unscathed. A spokesman for the NTC said 15 to 17 anti-Gaddafi fighters were killed in the attack. There were no further reports of fighting in the city. Benghazi-based Colonel Ahmed Omar Bani said defenders in Ra's Lanuf reported the attackers \\"did not look like Libyans\\" and suggested they could be refugees paid to fight by well-monied Gaddafi loyalists.

During the 1980s he became a leader in the theory of self-organization and pattern formation in open systems, later extending this work to adaptive complex systems and biocomplexity. In the late 1980s, he turned to study of bacterial self-organization, He developed new pattern forming bacteria species, becoming a pioneer in the study of bacterial intelligence and social behaviors of bacteria. Birth and early years Eshel Ben-Jacob was born on April 13, 1952 in Haifa Israel into a family of pioneers that immigrated to Israel in the 1930s. After graduating from high school, he matriculated to study physics and mathematics at Tel Aviv University and was drafted to the Israeli Navy two years later. He completed his B.Sc., M.Sc. and most of his PhD studies during the service (1972‚Äì1980) first in the Navy Weather Forecast unit and later in the Navy Intelligence. Academic education and career Ben-Jacob received a B.Sc. degree (1975) in physics from Tel Aviv University, a Certificate in System Analysis (1976) from the Technion (Israel Institute of Technology), and a M.Sc. degree (1978) (under the supervision of Y. Imry) and a PhD degree in physics (1982) (under the supervision of Y. Imry and D. J. Bergman) from Tel Aviv University. After three years (1981‚Äì1984) of postdoctoral research at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara, he joined the Physics Department at the University of Michigan (1984‚Äì1989). Since 1986, he has been a faculty member of the School of Physics and Astronomy at Tel Aviv University (full Professor since 1992 and the holder of the Maguy-Glass Chair in Physics of Complex Systems since 2003). Ben-Jacob was vice president (1998‚Äì2001) and president (2001‚Äì2004) of the Israel Physical Society. Since 2005, he has been a fellow of the Center for Theoretical Biological Physics, Rice University. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2014 as an International Member in the Physical Sciences Class. Contributions in physics * Life time and dynamics of non equilibrium states. * Coulomb Effect, Coulomb staircase and single electron-based transistor. * Quantum dynamics of relativistic solitons. * Soliton-mediated protein folding. * Pattern formation and self-organization. Contributions in biological physics =Social behavior of bacteria= In the early 1990s, Ben-Jacob's group discovered two pattern-forming bacteria species‚Äîthe Paenibacillus dendritiformis and the Paenibacillus vortex (see also Paenibacillus). Combining microbiological experiments with physical principles of self-organization and advanced modeling, Ben-Jacob advanced the recognition that bacteria are smart cooperative organisms that employ advanced communication to lead intricate social lives in large and complex colonies. Sophisticated chemical communication allows bacteria to rapidly adapt to changes in the environment, distribute tasks, \\"learn from experience\\", make decisions and prepare for the future. Ben-Jacob put forward the idea of bacterial social intelligence and his group devised a social IQ score of bacteria as a comparative genomic tool to assess the genome potential of bacteria to conduct successful cooperative and adaptable behaviors, or social behaviors, in complex environments. =Multi-agent swarming= Inspired by Ben-Jacob's observations of how bacteria can spontaneously order their motion during collective swarming, the groups of T. Vicsek and Ben-Jacob devised a simple model able to generate non-equilibrium states that violate the usual physics theorems for equilibrium states. This work has led to the creating of a new field of multi-agent swarming (swarming intelligence), proposed to explain a wide variety of phenomena ranging from collective navigation (swarming intelligence) of bacteria, amoeba and insects, to flocking of birds and schools of fish as well as to the design of autonomous vehicles capable of functional self-organization even in the absence of an overall omniscient controller. Using fratricide to fight bacteria: In 2000, Ben-Jacob's group discovered a fascinating phenomenon of competition between two sibling bacteria colonies of the P. dendritiformis when inoculated side by side. Recent studies of the phenomenon revealed that the two colonies not only inhibited each other from growing into the territory between them but induced the death of those cells close to the border. By employing molecular biology methods combined with the new genome sequencing information and bioinformatics, they discovered a new toxin (sibling lethal factor), which acts selectively only on the same bacterial strain. =Bacterial decision- making= Building upon understanding he gained from research in neuroscience (the inhibition of inhibition principle), Ben-Jacob and his collaborators discovered that the ingenious scheme is composed of a stochastic switch regulated by a timer with adaptable clock rate (that is adjusted by the cell stress) via a special decision-circuit composed of a cascade of inhibitions. The decision-circuits of the individual bacteria are coupled by exchange of chemical messages between the cells to guarantee collective decision for the group benefit. =Systems neuroscience and the neuro-memory-chip= Ben- Jacob's studies in neuroscience are guided by an effort to simplify the complexity searching for principles of information coding, memory and learning. He has many unique contributions in the field of Systems Neuroscience and Neural Networks, including the relations between network size and its synchronized activity, the discovery of hidden neuron correlations, function-form relations and mutual synchronization in engineered networks, the effect of DNA damage on network synchronization, neuro-glia communication, new modeling of intra- and inter-cell calcium dynamics, using nano technology for network engineering, discovery and modeling of the dynamical motives (repertoire) of coupled neural networks, development of a novel system-level analysis of neural network activity (the functional holography analysis), mapping and assessments of epileptic foci, and more. Yet, the development of the first neuro-memory-chip with his doctoral student at the time, Itay Baruchi, is Ben-Jacob's most important contribution in systems neuroscience. While previous attempts were based on \\"teaching by reward\\" (enhancing excitatory synapses) or \\"teaching by punishment\\" (inhibition of excitatory synapses), Baruchi and Ben-Jacob's approach was \\"teaching by liberation\\", or \\"inhibition of inhibition\\" (inhibition of inhibitory synapses). Being recognized as a groundbreaking discovery in systems neuroscience, the achievement was awarded in 2007 the SciAm 50, The Scientific American Award for the 50 most important achievements in all fields of science and technology. Immunology Together with Irun Cohen from the Weizmann institute of science, Ben-Jacob has established the Immune Development Initiative (IDI),Immune Development Initiative (IDI) a multi-disciplinary research collaboration including of immunologists, physicists and physicians. Econophysics In the field of the analysis of economic systems, he has published a new quantitative measure, the index cohesive force of the index effect on the stock market fragility.;on epileptic seizure-like behaviors in the US stock market; and hidden order in the market chaos. He developed a new class of correlation-based networks based on the concept of partial correlations. This led to the introduction of the dependency networks methodology. When applied to the U.S. stock market, it was successful in revealing the backbone of the market, quantitatively showing the dominance of the financial sector. Physics education While serving as president of the Israel Physical Society (IPS), Ben-Jacob devoted efforts to attract teenagers to Physics by establishing links between high school physics teachers and the ISF (Israel Science Foundation). He appointed a high school principal, Tehila Ben-Gai of HEMDAhttp://www.hemda.org.il/english/template/default.asp?maincat=2&catId;=10 Center for Science Education, as the Secretary of the ISF, and together they promoted joint annual scientific meetings between high school physics teachers and the ISF, faculty lectures to high school students, visits of high school classes in physics departments and more. During his presidency, he started the online magazine PhysicaPlus, the only Hebrew-English bilingual science magazine.

Along with a Windows 7, 8 or 10 certified Wi-Fi device it can act as a wireless access point. This enables users to share files, printers, and Internet connections between multiple computing devices without the need for a separate physical access point or router. Connectify spent the next two years improving the product, first making it free and ad-supported. In 2011, Connectify switched to a freemium commercial model which included premium features for paying customers. These features included extended support of 3G/4G mobile devices, fully customizable SSIDs and premium customer support. In 2011, Connectify received funding from In-Q-Tel to begin developing a more powerful and secure remote networking platform and a connection-aggregation application. Connectify used this funding to develop the foundation of the application, and then in 2012 turned to the crowdfunding site Kickstarter to raise additional funding to develop Connectify Dispatch. Dispatch was a load balancer which could combine any number of Ethernet, Wi-Fi or mobile Internet connections. In 2014, Connectify launched Speedify, a channel bonding application for PCs running Microsoft Windows and macOS.

The college contains four departments as well as a graduate program in the National Capital Region and a leadership institute for undergraduates. The College of Natural Resources and Environment conducts most of its research in facilities located in Blacksburg or through the National Science Foundation's Industry & University Cooperative Research Program (I/UCRC). In 2014-15, the college consisted of 1,023 students. The current dean of the college, Paul M. Winistorfer, was appointed in 2009. History Although the college was not officially established until 1992, its roots were present in Virginia Tech's history as early as 1925 when the first professor of forestry, Wilbur O‚ÄôByrne, was hired. By the early 1930s, students were able to study field horticulture, landscape design, and the chemical properties of sprays used to protect orchards. In 1938, the first bachelor of science degrees in conservation and forestry were offered in the Department of Biology. By 1969, the Department of Forestry and Wildlife had become the fastest growing department on campus, having grown from 66 undergraduates and five graduate students, to 346 undergraduates and 52 graduate students. That same year, the department was officially made a unit of the College of Agriculture, and by 1974, it split into the Department of Forestry and Forest Products and the Department of Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences. By 1975, a School of Forestry and Wildlife Resources was established. This school became an official university college in 1992, named the College of Forestry and Wildlife Resources. In 2000, the college changed its name to the College of Natural Resources before settling on its current title in 2010.From Jamestown to Blacksburg: The Path to the College of Natural Resources by Ellen A. Brown Academics The College of Natural Resources and Environment contains four departments and executive and traditional master's programs in the National Capital Region. As of 2010-11, the college had 737 students taking classes on the Blacksburg campus, thereby making it the smallest at Virginia Tech in terms of enrollment. =Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation= The Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation offers a bachelor of science in fisheries science and a bachelor of science in wildlife science to undergraduate students. It also offers an M.S. and Ph.D. in both fisheries and wildlife sciences to graduate students. =Geography= Undergraduates can earn a B.A. in geography. The department offers two options for undergraduate geography majors: culture, regions, and international development or geospatial and environmental analysis. The department has been approved to add an undergraduate B.S. degree in meteorology in spring 2012. This will be the only meteorology program offered in Virginia. Graduate students may earn an M.S. in geography. The Department of Geography also participates in the college's doctoral program in geospatial and environmental analysis. =Sustainable Biomaterials (formerly Wood science and forest products)= Undergraduates can earn a bachelor's degree in wood science and forest products. The department, which has a strong focus on biomaterials, offers students the opportunity to choose one of the following four options: packaging science, forest products business, residential wood structures, or wood materials science. Graduate students can earn an M.S., M.F., or Ph.D. though the department. =Forest resources and environmental conservation= Undergraduates can earn a B.S. in one of the following majors: forestry, environmental resource management, and natural resources conservation. Within a major, students can choose one of the following options: forest resource management, forest operations and business, urban forestry, environmental resource management, watershed management, conservation and recreation management, environmental education, and natural resource science education. Graduate students can earn an M.S., M.F., or Ph.D. through this department. The department actively participates in the college-wide doctoral program in geospatial and environmental analysis. =Natural resources graduate program (National Capital Region)= Located in the National Capital Region, the natural resources graduate program has three different areas on emphasis: urban issues, natural resource policy, and international perspectives. Through this program, students can earn a master of natural resources (M.N.R.), an executive master of natural resources (X.M.N.R.), or a certificate of graduate studies in natural resources. The executive master of natural resources focuses on leadership for sustainability. Currently, the natural resources graduate program offers over 30 courses in traditional and hybrid classroom settings. College of Natural Resources and Environment leadership institute In addition to these academic programs, the college has recently established the College of Natural Resources and Environment Leadership Institute for undergraduate students. In this two-semester study sequence, students study leadership styles and work on group projects focused on enhancing leadership qualities. Additionally, students meet with state government, state agencies, and non-governmental organizations in order to experience organizational and political processes in action. VT's National Capital Region offers Natural Resources and Environment programs within the Washington metropolitan area. National Capital Region In 1969 the university launched new locations within the Virginia Tech National Capital Region (NCR). These facilities serves as a hub in the Washington metropolitan area for its students and alumni. As of 2015, the NCR offers Graduate programs for the college. Research centers and cooperatives On Virginia Tech's main campus, faculty and students from the college conduct most of their research in Cheatham Hall and Latham Hall. These facilities can be used to study the physiology, nutrition, and genetics of trees, fish, and wildlife. Additionally, faculty and students have access to the Thomas M. Brooks Forest Products Center, located in the Corporate Research Center adjacent to the Blacksburg campus. The center contains laboratories for wood-based composites manufacture and testing, a high-bay wood engineering lab with full-scale timber testing equipment, a wood drying laboratory, the William A. Sardo Pallet Laboratory, and the Center for Unit Load Design laboratory. The Virginia Water Resources Research Center, established by the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1965 \\"for the purposes of developing, implementing and coordinating water and related land research programs,\\" is also located in Blacksburg. Beyond Blacksburg, the College of Natural Resources and Environment is also affiliated with research centers that are part of the National Science Foundation's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center program, such as the Wood-Based Composites Center and the Center for Advanced Forestry Systems. In addition, the college has connections to the Virginia Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, whose cooperators include the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the United States Geological Survey, the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, and the Wildlife Management Institute. The college has also been the recipient of research funding from national organizations. For example, in 2011, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) awarded Virginia Tech's Department of Forest Resources and Environmental Conversation $3.4 million of a coordinated agricultural grant to study the effects of climate change on southern pine forests. Additionally, in 2010, researchers from Virginia Tech's College of Natural Resources and Environment received a $3.4 million grant from the United States Department of the Interior to study the effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico on piping plovers, shorebirds that have been listed as threatened since 1986. Rankings According to a 2006 study of the research impact of North American forestry programs published in the Journal of Forestry, the College of Natural Resources and Environment's forestry program was second on the perceptions-based composite score and third on the citations-based and publications-based index. In 2010, the National Research Council also ranked the forestry Ph.D. program as one of the best in the nation. Additionally, during the last accreditation process in 1996, peer institutions ranked the college's wildlife and fisheries programs first and second, respectively. In addition to its academic programs, the college has also been ranked for its research programs. The National Science Foundation ranked the $91 million research program in the College of Natural Resources and Environment and the Virginia Tech College of Agriculture and Life Sciences fifth in the nation.

Many of the castro fortifications were used by the 13th century are defensible posts, including the Castle of Zurara. The mountain top, situated between Mangualde and Quintela de Azurara, is crowned by a small hermitage, known as Nossa Senhora do Castelo. This \\"castle\\" was the seat of the judicial authority of Zurara, and encompassed Quintela. Roman claims to this region include the old bridge, constructed of a single arch, but dating to the 17th century. The toponymy for the parish is from a Germanic origin, and alludes to an old medieval institution, the Quintana (in this case is the diminutive derived from ), an appendage of the remote Manoaldu(s) (origin of the centre of Mangualde). Ecclesiastically, Quintela was part of S√£o Juli√£o, whose abbey, Martim Gon√ßalves, was arrested by King Sancho II, for unknown reasons. After his imprisonment, the monarch partitioned the church and curia to the other parishes of Mangualde, including Quintela, to Mem Euniges (deacon of Coimbra), later to Afonso Mendes, and much later, to Salvador Peres, Sancho II's confessor. Quintela was a possession of Pedro √Ålvares Cabral, the famous navigator. In 1758, from the writings of Father Jos√© Le√£o de Cabral Teixeira (abbey at Quintela), the residents of the parish paid 33000 r√©is to the old House of the Cabrals, nobles of Belmonte. This sum was distributed annually by the inhabitants of the comarca according to each family's possessions. At this time the parish included the locality of Canelas and, despite corresponding to the dominion of the Church of S√£o Jo√£o de Zurara, the 1258 Inqueries, Quintela was not even a parish, although the church was called S√£o Jo√£o da Quintela. Geography Quintela de Azurara is located from the seat of the municipality of Mangualde. Economy Within its borders is a stannery, named Porto, in addition to several granite quarries: apart from agriculture, the quarrying industries are activities that support the local economy.

Some kinists were associated with the Neo-Confederate League of the South; one of its members stated that \\"The non-white immigration invasion is the ‚ÄòFinal Solution‚Äô to the 'white' problem of the South, White race genocide. We believe the Kinism statement proposes a biblical solution for all races. If whites die out, the South will no longer exist.\\" The works of Robert Lewis Dabney and Rousas John Rushdoony play a large role in the ideology of many kinists. Joel LeFevre, successor to Samuel T. Francis as editor of The Citizens Informer, the publication of the white nationalist Council of Conservative Citizens, endorsed kinism and said \\"[V]ery simply, without some level of discrimination, no nation‚Ä¶ can permanently exist at all.\\" Kinists claim that the Bible prohibits miscegenation and racial integration. The Anti-Defamation League notes that \\"Despite having an explicit, racially centric set of beliefs, Kinists often deny that they are racists.\\" The movement is loosely organized and as a result, it does not have a single leader; as of 2003, there were various kinist activists in the United States, many of them had an Internet presence which consisted of websites and blogs. Kinists are different from other white supremacist sects, such as Christian Identity, Wotansvolk and Creativity: \\"What sets Kinists apart from many other white supremacist groups is their adherence to a biblical form of Christianity whose core belief is universal salvation through Jesus.

Course of streams and Grabenbach in Bad Reichenhall around 1900. The red squares are places where hydropower was used, e.g. mills. History The tunnel was built after plans of Erasmus Grasser from about 1524 to 1538. After the route has been determined in 1522, the construction was started in 1524 under the direction of master builder Fabian Zehentner and the supervision of the Salzmaier (supervisor of the saline) Hans Humbs. The tunnel was dug from north to south, towards the higher saline. Therefore, with progressing work one had to dug deeper and deeper; a gradient of had to be compensated. During length, the canal was walled high and wide, vaulted and then filled with soil again. In 1534, the well shaft was reached and in 1538 the construction work was finished. Course The Grabenbach begins in the old saline and reaches the surface again near the street Gewerkenstra√üe. On the nearly long line, there are five air shafts. Then it flows for another through the Marzoller Au to the Saalach. At the Kurstra√üe street, one of the shafts was renovated. Through a glass plate one now can see the Grabenbach flowing in the deep. The river is passable by boat, at irregular intervals guided tours through the tunnel are offered for small groups. Purpose The Grabenbach leads intruding fresh water and water driving the wheels out of the galleries, so that it does not mix with the salty water. Today a part of the water is used for a water-treading basin in the pedestrian zone. Additionally, there are pipes in the canal that carry the brine to the graduation tower and the spa pump room.

The sources include the writings of a number of rabbis, European and American philosophers, psychologists, poets and theologians, as well as some Biblical scripture. Islam and Hinduism are represented by Rumi and Hafiz, Ramakrishna and Kabir, the Baghavad Gita and the Upanishads. Composition and publication Gollancz started reading for the book (which he also used in From Darkness to Light) over the winter of 1943, when recovering from a nervous breakdown he had had in June of that year, and worked on it intermittently until it was published.Edwards, Ruth Dudley, Victor Gollancz: A Biography, Gollancz Ltd, 1987, pp. 382 & 546. He wrote it over the winter of 1949, and it was published on 2 October 1950.Edwards pp. 488 & 573. Gollancz gave the royalties from the book to his daughters, and felt the book would do good to the world. A Year of Grace became a Christmas bestseller in the UK and by June 1951 had sold a healthy 40,000.Edwards p. 581. In America the book was published as Man and God by Houghton Mifflin, and was made Book of the Month Club Choice. However, it sold much less well on the other side of the Atlantic, only shifting 5,000 copies.Edwards p. 600. Synopsis and polemic intent The book is divided into five parts. The first part concerns God's Mercy and Love, A Reading of Christ, and Joy and Praise. The second part focuses on Good and Evil, Sin and Repentance, and Man, fellow-worker with God. The third part covers The Relation of Man to Man. The fourth part is broken into six sections: Acceptance, Man's Dignity and Responsibility, Activity, Integrity, Humility, and Freedom. The fifth and final part looks at The Self, Intimations, and The Many and the One. In his foreword, Gollancz writes that the work is a \\"rather polemical\\" approach to expressing a mood, rather than a doctrine, about God and man. It is a response to both anti-religious humanism and anti-humanistic religion. Earlier in 1950, prior to the publication of A Year of Grace, Gollancz gave lectures on religion and humanism while on a visit to Germany. He focused on the twin dangers of anti-religious humanism, which regarded mankind as self-sufficient, and anti-humanistic religion, which gave a view of man as a \\"wretched, powerless, worthless sinner, miserable slave of a God conceived of as capricious and omnipotent tyrant\\". Religious humanism combined a belief in man's creative potential with \\"man as a fellow- worker with God\\". For Gollancz freedom was key to this line of thought.Gollancz's lecture notes in Edwards, pp. 549‚Äì50. He intended the book to be read consecutively, so each passage might illuminate the other, and although he acknowledged that it is full of contradictions, he hoped the mood is consistent.Victor Gollancz A Year of Grace - Passages chosen and arranged to express a mood about God and man, Victor Gollancz Ltd, 1950, pp. 15‚Äì16. Martin Buber, the Jewish philosopher, helped revise the translations from his own Jewish Mysticism and the Legends of Baalshem. On an autobiographical note, Gollancz writes that the mood of the anthology is one that has been with him since a very small boy. In 1961 he published The New Year of Grace: an Anthology for Youth and Age, including new selections and personal commentaries. Influences Rabbi Lionel Blue has credited the selections in A Year of Grace as having infected him with spirituality \\"like measles\\", and credits the book with steering him away from an anti-religious attitude.Lionel Blue, The Godseeker's Guide, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2010, Author Colin Wilson writes that he was inspired to send his book The Outsider to Gollancz after finding a copy of A Year of Grace in a second-hand bookshop, believing that he had found a sympathetic publisher. Gollancz reacted enthusiastically to Wilson and published the book.Colin Wilson, The Angry Years: The Rise and Fall of the Angry Young Men, Robson, 2007, pp. 15‚Äì16, . Reception Plaudits for A Year of Grace came from a wide readership, including Alec Vidler, the Anglican theologian, who found it compassionate and searching. Many of Gollancz's friends gave positive comments, including George Bell, the Bishop of Chichester, Lettice Cooper, Stafford Cripps, Daphne Du Maurier and Dean Inge. Rose Macaulay disliked certain inclusions, particularly those of William Blake. Overall the book received a small, but largely positive press. Gollancz often wrote to reviewers who he felt had misunderstood his message, and A Year of Grace was no exception. He corrected Herbert Read's suggestion in the New Statesman that Gollancz was disillusioned with politics, when nothing was further from the truth ‚Äì rather, he wrote in a letter to the magazine, the book demonstrated that politics was an essential activity.Edwards pp. 575‚Äì77. Jill Balcon read extracts from A Year of Grace at Gollancz's funeral. Edwards p. 736. On the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs, the anthology was chosen as the castaway's book by both Victor Gollancz, in 1961, and travel writer Colin Thubron in 1989.Desert Island Discs archive, BBC Radio ‚Äì Desert Island Discs microsite.

It flows southwards of Munich, through the townships of Oberhaching, Taufkirchen, Unterhaching and Unterbiberg, and enters the Munich city area in Perlach. It is twelve kilometers long. The source of the Hachinger Bach is in a former glacial valley between the districts of Deisenhofen and Oberhaching, where water from the Deininger wetland flows as groundwater through the Glei√üental, which connects to the Hachinger Tal. About 100 metres into the Hachinger Tal, the ground becomes progressively wetter due to exudation of groundwater, until a small stream forms. Due to fluctuations in the water table, no location can be assigned as the source. To keep the stream from running dry, water is piped into it. The stream is further fed by additional groundwater and influx from sources such as the Taufkirchen duckpond. The flint layer that had kept the groundwater close to the surface, allowing the stream to form, drops deeper just north of Unterhaching, which also causes the water table to drop. That would have caused the river to go underground in the gravel of the Munich floodplain, but due to the formation of a silt bed caused by the stream itself, it only goes underground just north of Ostpark at the borders of the districts of Perlach, Ramersdorf and Berg am Laim. Like almost all waterways in Germany, the Hachinger Bach was regulated in the past, and had its course altered to suit current requirements, for example being routed around Neubiberg air base. In the meantime, long sections of the riverbed were restored, for example in the Hachinger Tal landscape park at the location of the previous airfield. The stream currently flows along the western edge of the Ostpark and then crosses under Heinrich-Wieland-Stra√üe, and ends after a further 120 m in an intake with an automatic rake to remove fouling from the grate. An infiltration basin next to the intake serves to contain water when the flow rate is too high for the intake, to avoid flooding. Since 1933, the stream has been carried by an underground concrete pipeline from this point up to the railway triangle south of the A94 at the southernmost point of the Munich district called Bogenhausen, where it feeds the H√ºllgraben, which starts from there. The pipe runs under Kampenwandstra√üe, turns along the Hachinger-Bach-Stra√üe east until St.-Veit-Stra√üe. It runs north under St.-Veit-Stra√üe until it leads to the point when it flows into the H√ºllgraben. The H√ºllgraben flows into the Johanneskirchen wetland in the Abfanggraben, which flows into the central Isar canal at the Neufinsing hydroelectric station. Since the 1980s, the residents of Berg am Laim have requested that the 3.8 km section between Ostpark and H√ºllgraben should be brought to the surface. From the underground intake to the Josephsburg U-Bahn station pavilion at Kreillerstra√üe, there is already a dry riverbed, but the original plans to route the stream to the surface at the 2005 Bundesgartenschau failed due to budget insufficiencies. In 2009 the plan was raised again at a citizens' meeting, without concrete results . The name of the stream is derived from the Hacho Bavarii, who built settlements along the stream in the 5th and 8th centuries. The stream used to dry up approximately every seven years, and would reappear in the following year. Because the connection with groundwater was not known in these days, a number of legends grew up around the stream, in which the devil was made responsible for the disappearance of the stream. Other variants describe two brothers disputing about who would inherit a mill on the stream: because they could not agree, God made the stream vanish into the earth upstream of the mill, so that it would not run anymore.

Previously, EyeGuide made the EyeGuide Tracker, an affordable and effective eye tracking device compatible for lab use. Following the success of the EyeGuide Tracker, the firm set out to make its tracker fully mobile: the EyeGuide Mobile Tracker. EyeGuide or \\"EG\\" for short was developed so users can take the core EyeGuide technology and integrate it into other products such as football and military helmets, glasses, video game accessories, and medical equipment. In a first- person shooter game, for example, as the player's head moves, the avatar would move correspondingly on the screen‚Äîup, down, or side to side. As the player looks at a target, the avatar would focus in precisely on that target, resulting in faster, more natural, immersive game play. It is an intended stepping stone for augmented reality applications visualized and controlled directly via the eyes. The company was founded in 2010 by Dr. Brian Still at Texas Tech University. EyeGuide was developed as an affordable alternative to other eye trackers for the Texas Tech University‚Äôs usability lab.

Cast and Kristin Cast. It was published on July 12, 2011 by St. Martin's Press an extension of Macmillan Publishers. The first book of the series takes place in Dragon's past, describing his meeting with Anastasia. Plot Dragon sits by Jack's funeral pyre and reminisces about his first meeting with Anastasia. He pulls out a locket and opens it, but the wind lifts the last of her hair inside and carries it over to the pyre. This starts a spell Anastasia had laid on the locket, that conveys to Dragon her last wish, to temper his blade with mercy. The book goes back to his human days. The third son of a lord, Bryan is young, cocky and bold. His father disowns him when he becomes involved in a scandal with a neighbour's daughter and sends him to the Americas. At the docks he meets a Tracker, who claims him as a fledgling and takes him abord a ship with a sculpted dragon's head, which inspires Bryan in regards to his new name. At the Chicago House of Night, Anastasia, a 22-year-old newly adult vampyre, has been hired as the Spells and Rituals teacher. While talking with the local High Priestess, Pandeia, and her mate, Anastasia brings up the problem of some fledglings who had asked for a love spell for Bryan. Instead of refusing them, she asks permission to perform a drawing spell, to show the fledglings the truth about Bryan. She starts the spell on a night with a full moon. As she is also thinking of him at the time of the spell, she is shown a futuristic apparition of him, when he has fully Changed and is no longer a fledgling. Anastasia finds that she loves Bryan, and then he really appears as his nineteen-year- old self. Bryan, who is now Dragon, helps Anastasia finish her spell, and begins leaving her sun-flowers from that moment. An officer, Jesse Biddle, consults with a creature (it is revealed at that this is Rephaim, the Raven Mocker who is Stevie Rae's Consort) about who he should kill ‚Äì Anastasia ‚Äì so that Light doesn't defeat them. At the House of Night, Pandeia expresses concern regarding Biddle's harassment. Anastasia proposes she go and perform a peace spell. As a Warrior represents the opposite of the spell, they propose she take Bryan, who is still a fledgling, but already a Swordmaster. While she performs a circle near his place, Anastasia is attacked by Biddle and dragged inside after he chokes Bryan. Biddle fights and nearly kills Anastasia, and prepares to rape her, but she draws a circle of salt around her and creates a barrier. Dragon comes and kills Biddle, and prepares to also kill the creature, but Anastasia has a vision of him and tells him to temper his strength with mercy, and think about what he's doing. Dragon sets the creature free and pledges his Warrior's Oath to her. As a result, he Changes into an adult vampyre. Back to the present, Nyx and Anastasia materialize in front of him and make a last attempt to make him move on but he refuses. In the end he rejects Nyx for refusing to return Anastasia to him.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) considers a flight to be delayed when it is 15 minutes later than its scheduled time. A cancellation occurs when the airline does not operate the flight at all for a certain reason. In the European Union, Flight Compensation Regulation 261/2004 states that flight delays for over three hours, cancellations and denied boarding entitles passengers to a compensation from ‚Ç¨250 up to ‚Ç¨600 per passenger from the airline.EC Regulation 261/2004 In the United States, when flights are canceled or delayed, passengers may be entitled to compensation due to rules obeyed by every flight company, usually Rule 240, or Rule 218 in certain locations. This rule usually specifies that passengers may be entitled to certain reimbursements, including a free room if the next flight is the day after the canceled one, a choice of reimbursement, rerouting, phone calls, and refreshments. When a flight is delayed, the FAA allocates slots for takeoffs and landings based on which flight is scheduled first. The Transportation Department imposes a fine of up to $27,500 per passenger for planes left on the tarmac for more than three hours without taking off (four hours for international flights). In the United States, passengers are not entitled to compensation when a delay occurs, not even a cut of fees airlines must pay federal authorities for long delays. Airlines are required to pay for lodging costs of passengers if the delay or a cancellation is through their own fault, but not if the cause is beyond their control, such as weather. Causes Since 2003, the United States Bureau of Transportation Statistics has been keeping track of the causes of flight delays. The number of flight delays has increased as staff has been cut back as a result of the financial woes following the September 11 attacks. Some of the causes of flight delays or cancellation include: *Airline glitches. The top cause of flight delays, according to a USA TODAY analysis. *Congestion in air traffic *Earthquakes and tsunamis (e.g., in the event of 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, 2010 Chile earthquake, and the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami) *Fueling *Inclement weather, such as thunderstorm, hurricane, or blizzard *Late arrival of the aircraft to be used for the flight from a previous flight *Maintenance problems with the aircraft *Security issues *Terrorist attacks (e.g., suicide bombing in the event of Domodedovo International Airport bombing, the 2016 Brussels bombings, and the 2016 Atat√ºrk Airport attack) Effects =Cost to airlines= In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration estimates that flight delays cost airlines $22 billion yearly. Airlines are forced to pay federal authorities when they hold planes on the tarmac for more than three hours for domestic flights or more than four hours for international flights. =Cost to passengers= Flight delays are an inconvenience to passengers. A delayed flight can be costly to passengers by making them late to their personal scheduled events and commitments. A passenger who is delayed on a multi-plane trip could miss a connecting flight. Anger, frustration and even Air rage can occur in delayed passengers. = Compensation = Flights from the US to the EU on EU airlines are covered by Regulation 261/2004. This requires airlines to pay compensation of up to ‚Ç¨600 if the flight is delayed more than three hours on arrival (four hours for long-haul flights). Flights to the US from the EU are covered by the regulation regardless of the airline. This means a US airline can still be required to pay passengers compensation under Regulation 261/2004. For example, a flight departing London to New York on American Airlines would be covered by the regulation, but the return journey on the same airline would not. The New York to London flight on an EU carrier, such as British Airways or Virgin, would be covered.  Flight delay data in the USA  This graphs represents the average flight delay per month and per day of the USA's 10 biggest airports, namely; Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, New York (JFK), Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Seattle and Charlotte. = Yearly data analysis = Based on flight delay data from 2015 some correlations can be shown. The analysis focuses on America's ten biggest airports, those are; Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, New York (JFK), Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Seattle and Charlotte. Data analysis confirms that the distribution of delays at departure is very similar to that at arrival and there is a strong correlation between the two data. Observed is namely the average time of delay per month and the tendency of delays depending on the days of the week. It is clearly noticed that the average delay of a flight was larger in February, June, July and December. This seems to be strongly correlated with holiday periods. As can be expected September has a rather low average delay. One can derive that the probability of encountering a flight delay is larger in the above-mentioned months. Also, the busiest days to be flying are mainly Mondays, Sundays and Thursdays. Fridays are also a popular day to be flying. = Causes of delay = This graph provides information about the amount of flight delays caused by certain factors. There are several causes for a flight to be delayed. It is interesting to look at the proportions or chances of encountering certain delay type. More than half of the fights tend to be late (this taking account minor delays such as 5 or 10 min delays). Most planes are late due to air system issues or airline delays. This is interesting because it means that it is an area of the airline industry that could be optimized. Supporting our argument, one notices that the lower amount of delays are caused due to weather and security issues. Showing us that security for example is optimized to a very large level and other types of delays could eventually be avoided by optimizing organization in airports or establishing a delay prevention schedule. Weather delays are rather rare and are not primary reasons for flights to be delayed. = Performances = These graph describe the amount of delay type; large, medium or small, based on certain factors such as the airline, the departure airline, wind speed and holidays. This section illustrates performances of Airlines and Airports in being on time in 2015, the focus is on the USA's ten biggest airports, namely; Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, New York (JFK), Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Seattle and Charlotte. Delays are divided into three categories, namely \\"on time or small delay\\" (up to 15 minutes delay), \\"Medium delay\\" (15 ‚Äì 45 minutes delay) and \\"Large delay\\" ( 45 minutes delay). In this way the graphic representation is more understandable as well as the possibility of directly comparing the variables related with delays. As represented one can observe that Airlines that were particularly good at being on time compared to other airlines were Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Alaska Airlines. Those that tend to have a larger delay are Spirit Airlines, American Southeast Airlines and Frontier Airlines. Even if some observations can be made one cannot say that one airline is better than another. The same type of analysis can be one for different airports. In this case one can observe that airports such as New York and Atlanta stand out positively, while the one with the worst frequency of delays is Chicago. However, the differences are less obvious and, generally speaking, one can conclude that airlines play a more significant role than the airports of departure. Finally, the weather variables (humidity, wind speed) and holidays are analysed. After observing that the correlation between humidity and delays is almost zero, one could notice that both the wind speed and the holidays instead have a certain impact on flight delays.

He came from a peasant family of Zhangzhou Hokkien ancestry, he lived in the village of Lohanmen located in the area of modern- day Neimen District, Kaohsiung, there he worked raising ducks and was a respected member of the local community. In 1721 an earthquake wrought havoc to Lohanmen, even more the prefect of the island, , not only kept collecting heavy taxes even among the impoverished people who lost their possessions with the earthquake. Zhu was one of those who rose in rebellion and his good reputation among the locals gave him enough followers so that on 19 April he attacked and captured the city of Kua-chin-na (; modern-day Gangshan). Other rebel leaders acted on the island so that the Qing authorities were heavily pressured. Hoklo, Hakka and Taiwanese aborigines rallied in revolt against the Manchu authorities. Zhu and (another rebel commander of Teochew descent and leader of the Hakka forces) combined their forces and launched an attack on the seat of Tainan Prefecture, the administrative capital of the island, which felled almost without a fight. The Qing authorities retreated to Penghu. The rebel army continued its movement on the western coastal plains. On 1 May, Zhu took the title of Zhongxing Wang (‰∏≠ËààÁéã; Reviving King) and the name Yong He (Ê∞∏Âíå; Enduring Peace), he also established an administration reminiscent of the Ming dynasty. His power started to weaken after disputes with Du Junying, disastrously this occurred at the same time that the Manchu government, organized an expedition against the rebels. The Imperial forces commanded by (d. 1721 at the age of 55 sui) and (1664‚Äì1730), landed on 16 June and on 28 June Zhu was captured and executed. Zhu Yigui (1690 AD-1707 AD) Zhu Yigui was a national hero in Taiwan but Taiwan failed in the early resistance against the Qing Dynasty The garden saw Xuantian God. Xuantian God asked him to come out to save the people. Zhu Yigui decided that he could resist the Qing Dynasty as long as he became emperor. However, Zhu Yigui resisted the Qing Dynasty and was framed by the people of Taiwan. Execution beheading Zhu Yigui was decapitated at the age of 17, so Zhu Yigui only died at the age of 17 The people of Taiwan gradually forgot Zhu Yigui, but now the Taiwanese have helped Zhu Yigui build a statue for the purpose of the year.

Her financial matters are handled by a banker named Chris Patterson, who does because he knows that Miss Morely-Johnson is fond of him and gives him costly gifts. When Miss Morely-Johnson‚Äôs companion-help goes away, she asks Patterson to search for one. Patterson falls for an applicant named Sheila, and Miss Morely-Johnson seems to like her because allegedly Sheila had played on stage with her father. Patterson is excited about Sheila getting the job because he can meet her. What Patterson does not know is that Sheila has been fixed beforehand by Bromhead, who plans to execute the perfect crime of killing Miss Morely-Johnson and making it appear like an accident. That way, her insurance money goes to a nephew of hers, Harry, who is in love with Sheila as well. The plan was that, after Morely-Johnson's death, they would divide the money in three equal parts and move on.

She became the first woman hired to work in the United States Public Health Service's Hygienic Laboratory, at the National Institutes of Health. Life and Education Ida Bengtson was born in Harvad, Nebraska in 1881 as the daughter of Swedish immigrants. She attended the University of Nebraska graduating in 1903 with degrees in mathematics and languages. Early career Following graduation, Bengtson began working at the U.S. Geological Survey Library. Finding the job to be of low interest to her she spoke to a close friend who encouraged her to go back to school and pursue her master and eventually a Ph.D. In 1911, she entered the University of Chicago to study bacteriology, and earned her master's degree in 1913 and her PhD in 1919, both from the University of Chicago. While studying, she also worked as a bacteriologist in the Chicago Department of Health in 1915. In 1916 she became the first woman hired to work in the United States Public Health Service's Hygienic Laboratory, at the National Institutes of Health. Ida paved the way for the hiring of additional female scientists in the NIH lab and worked alongside other influential women such as Alice Evans who went on to serve as the first woman president of the Society of American Bacteriologists. Main Impacts Ida Bengston =Typhus= Following her hiring at the NIH, Bengtson helped to discover that the 1917 tetanus outbreak running ramped across the US, could be traced back to a batch of contaminated vaccine scarifiers. After this finding, Bengtson began further researching the infectious diseases presenting themselves in various communities across the United States. This research included the production of a typhus vaccine, and perhaps the most significant contribution of her career: the complement fixation test. This test led to revolutionary findings in regards to detecting the differentiation of diseases including Rocky Mountain spotted Fever and Q fever. =Clostridium botulinum= Bengtson's most significant scientific achievement was in regards to an organism called Clostridium botulinum, which causes a paralytic disease in chicken. This organism was first recognized and isolated in 1895 by Emile van Ermengem from home cured ham implicated in a botulism outbreak.E. van Ergmengem. 1897. √úber einen neuen anaerobic Bacillus and seine Beziehungen Zum Botulismus. Zentralbl. Hyg. Infektionskr. 26:1‚Äì8. The isolate was originally named Bacillus botulinus, after the Latin word for sausage, botulus. (\\"Sausage poisoning\\" was a common problem in 18th- and 19th- century Germany, and was most likely caused by botulism.)Frank J. Erbguth. Historical notes on botulism, Clostridium botulinum, botulinum toxin, and the idea of the therapeutic use of the toxin. Movement Disorders. Volume 19, Issue S8, pages S2-S6, March 2004. However, isolates from subsequent outbreaks were always found to be anaerobic spore formers, so Bengtson proposed that the organism be placed in the genus Clostridium as the genus Bacillus was restricted to aerobic spore-forming rods.I. A. Bengston. 1924. Studies on organisms concerned as causative factors in botulism. Hyg. Lab. Bull. 136:101 =Trachoma= Based on her work with the US Public Health Service (USPHS), now the NIH, she was moved to Rolla, Missouri, to begin to investigate the trachoma pandemic that was particularly widespread in the region of Alabama, Missouri, Tennessee, and Oklahoma. She arrived in Rolla in 1924 and took her place in the biology lab at the Missouri School of Mines (MSM, now Missouri S&T;), in the basement of Parker Hall.https://www.ladyscience.com/selective- blindness-ida-bengtson-and-the-treatment-of-trachoma/no51 Bengtson ran the trachoma hospital in Rolla, one of only 4 in the country at the time. It was in a small, wood framed house on Elm Street, but it soon was too small to serve all the people who needed treatment. After Bengtson left Rolla in 1931, a new trachoma hospital was built in 1939, and today houses the Rock Mechanics and Explosives Research Center on S&T;'s campus. During her short time in Rolla, Bengtson worked with animals and over 1500 human patients to isolate the bacteria causing the debilitating disease. She slowed the progression of the disease in over 1000 people, and, according to The Kansas City Star, Bengtson ‚Äúmade Rolla the chief American battle front in the war on‚Äù trachoma. =Toxins= She is also known for preparing, during 1935‚Äì1936, the standard for gas gangrene toxins and anti-toxins. One of Bengtson's other research interests was typhus, an exceedingly dangerous interest and she, like many other typhus researchers, eventually contracted the disease, although she recovered fully. Her chapter on the family ‚ÄúRickettsiaceae‚Äù appeared in the sixth edition of the influential Bergey‚Äôs Manual of Determinative Bacteriology after her official retirement. She was awarded the Typhus Medal of the American Typhus Commission in 1947. Death Ida Albertina Bengtson had a career lasting 30 years. She retired in 1946. She published and contributed substantially to the field of bacteriology and public health. Bengtson died in 1952.

Growing up, Saba developed many different hobbies and participated in a variety of extracurricular activities ranging from sports such as Alpine skiing, Biking, Running, Field Hockley, Ice Hockey and Lacrosse. But the hobby that Saba most connected with was cooking. Saba studied in the United States obtaining a BA from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and then continuing on to Hospitality Management at the French Culinary Institute in New York City. Working for a prestigious catering company in Manhattan and organizing events, she worked closely with some of the best chefs the city had to offer.

He was a co-founder of New Zealand's first heritage lobby group, the Civic Trust. Early life Beaven was born in Christchurch, the son of Eric Tamate Beaven and Joan Maria Scott Jamieson. His mother was the daughter of William Graham Jamieson and May Jamieson (n√©e Whitehouse). William Jamieson and his brother James Jamieson were renowned builders for the early Christchurch area, who constructed buildings like the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, Otahuna, Strowan House and the original office of The Press in Cashel Street. The construction business was established in 1864 by his great- grandfather, Samuel Jamieson, who arrived from Scotland at Lyttelton on board the Captain Cook on 5 September 1863. Beaven was educated at Christ's College and the School of Architecture of the University of Auckland. A conversation with the architect Paul Pascoe during his secondary school time led to the choice of his professional career. His tertiary education was interrupted by war service with the Royal New Zealand Navy. Professional career Beaven was based in Timaru for four years after his graduation, mainly designing woolstores all over New Zealand. He then moved to Christchurch, where he established his practice in the mid-1950s. Early in his career, he explored the world and lived in Japan for six months in the early 1950s, and undertook major tours to Europe and Asia in the early 1960s, all of which influenced his architectural style. His outlook soon became focussed on his local Christchurch, and he was inspired by Victorian Gothic Revival and worked a lot with symbolism. The Lyttelton Road Tunnel Administration Building uses the latter approach, with the brief asking for a grand entrance to the Canterbury Plains. With reference to the First Four Ships, Beaven designed the building as the fifth ship moored next to the motorway at the tunnel entrance. The building, in the form of the tub of a ship, is based on exposed pile foundations, with low planting representing the sea around the ship. The Modern Movement architecture employed here has form following function and was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category I heritage building on 14 May 2008. It was honoured as an example of Beaven's contribution to New Zealand architecture. The toll booths were removed in 1979 when the tunnel toll was removed, and the canopy once over the toll booths was demolished after receiving damage from rock fall caused by the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. The former approach inspired the Manchester Unity Building and later known as the SBS Building, built in 1967 on the corner of Manchester and Worcester Streets. The design won an award from the New Zealand Institute of Architects (NZIA) in 1969, and was honoured again with a 25-year design award by NZIA in 1999. According to Beaven, the judges described it as \\"the most significant post-war office building\\". The nine-storey building was demolished in September 2011 following damage received during the February 2011 earthquake. Bevan designed a high rise on the corner of Cashel and High Streets in Christchurch for the United Building Society, later called United Bank. The building was in the 1990s converted into a hotel. The Holiday Inn was demolished later in 2012 by the long reach excavator Twinkle Toes. The 2011 earthquake had a devastating effect on Beavan's legacy, leaving two of his best-preserved buildings in North London, UK: a housing development in Wedderburn Road in Belsize Park (1982) and the Tile Kiln Studios in Highgate (1982). When Beaven turned 80 in 2005, he was New Zealand's oldest practising architect. At the time of his death, his last commission, a house in Ashburton, was nearing completion. Awards and recognition Sir Miles Warren and Beaven are the only two Christchurch architects who have been awarded the New Zealand Institute of Architects gold medal. Beaven received his gold medal in 2003. Beaven is credited with having made a significant contribution to retaining the Christchurch Arts Centre after the University of Canterbury moved to its new campus in Ilam. In the 2012 Canterbury Heritage Awards held on 13 September, Beaven was posthumously awarded the Heritage Champion Award.

His second marriage was to Jocelyn Allison (n√©e Beadel) from 1984 until their divorce in 1994. Lesley Beaven was his third wife. He died in Blenheim on 4 June 2012, where he had lived for his last few months. He could not live in Christchurch any longer, as life there since the 2011 Christchurch earthquake was too difficult for him: > Christchurch is pretty much hell for me now, as someone who's spent 60 years > in architecture and history. That's all gone now. I've lost all my > background really. Blenheim is healing... Beaven's funeral service was held at the Christ's College Chapel. He is survived by his third wife, his three children and eight grandchildren. He had co-founded the Christchurch Civic Trust, New Zealand's first lobby group for heritage buildings. To many, Beaven was less known as an architect, but more for his outspokenness. He was a lobbyist for good design and when he disagreed with a proposal, there was no ambiguity. He called the Chalice in Cathedral Square a \\"vent to an underground toilet\\", and the Christchurch Art Gallery was for him \\"that great alien\\". Peter and Lesley Beaven were prominent opponents of the alterations to Canterbury Museum, designed by Ian Athfield and approved by Christchurch City Council, but rejected by the Environment Court in 2006.

Commonly known as the lesser Asian scorpion or the mottled scorpion. It is thought to be the most widely dispersed species of the genus Mesobuthus, perhaps even of the family Buthidae. Description M. eupeus can reach a size of in length. The entire body is yellow to yellowish brown. The dorsal segments (tergites) of the mesosoma often have longitudinal irregular stripes that are black to dark brown. They exhibit sexual dimorphism, the adult females being generally larger than males but have a lower number of pectinal teeth (16 to 23, as opposed to 22 to 28 in males). The pedipalps of M. eupeus have a maximum of ten diagonal rows of granules on the fixed finger and eleven on the movable finger. The pedipalp chelae (pincers) are wider than the patella (segment IV). The segments of the metasoma are thick and have eight keels (octocarinate). The telson is subglobose with a flat dorsal surface. Taxonomy M. eupeus were first described by the German arachnologist Carl Ludwig Koch in 1839. It is classified under the genus Mesobuthus and belongs to the largest family of scorpions, the thick-tailed scorpion family Buthidae. Currently, more than 23 subspecies of M. eupeus are recognized. Ecology M. eupeus feed on small insects such as crickets or small cockroaches. Cannibalism is very rare in this species. They do not dig burrows and prefer using natural spaces and burrows under stones and other objects. They have slender pedipalps so they usually rely on their stings for killing their prey. Venom The venom of M. eupeus is not as potent as that of other dangerous buthid species. Victims of stings feel intense pain, hyperemia, swelling and a burning sensation in the affected area, while numbness and itching were also reported in some cases. As in other scorpions, the venom of M. eupeus contains various neurotoxic proteins that interact specifically with ion channels. A number of unique proteins in this scorpion's venom have been identified, cloned and investigated for clinical applications. For instance, MeuKTX, structurally related to BmKTX (Œ±-KTx3.6) from M. martensii, potently inhibits rKv1.1, rKv1.2 and hKv1.3 channels but does not affect rKv1.4, rKv1.5, hKv3.1, rKv4.3, and hERG channels even at high concentrations. In contrast, BeKm-1 specifically inhibits hERG channels, which are potassium channels critical to maintaining normal electrical activities in the heart, but showed no effects on various other potassium channels tested. Inhibitors of sodium channels have also been found in this venom. MeuNaTxa-12 and MeuNaTxa-13 can affect cloned mammalian Nav subtypes rNav1.1, rNav1.2, rNav1.4 and mNav1.6, but not rNav1.5. In vivo assays showed that these two toxins have potential to be insecticidal agents, with MeuNaTxa-12 having 5-fold higher toxicity than MeuNaTxa-13. A number of antimicrobial peptides have also been found in the venom of M. eupeus. Meucin-13 and Meucin-18 exhibited extensive cytolytic effects on bacteria, fungi and yeasts. Furthermore, Meucin-24 and Meucin-25, first identified from genetic sequences expressed in their venom gland, were shown to selectively kill Plasmodium falciparum and inhibit the development of Plasmodium berghei, both malaria parasites, but do not harm mammalian cells. These two venom-derived proteins are therefore attractive candidates for the development of anti-malarial drugs. Iranian researchers have also reported that the venom of M. eupeus has anti-inflammatory properties and is effective as an anti-arthritis treatment in an experimental rat model, but the mechanism of action is unknown. Habitat and distribution Mesobuthus eupeus mostly lives in arid or semi-arid habitats with little or no vegetation. Its geographical distributions consists of eastern Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, southern Russia, northern Syria, eastern Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Australia, southern Mongolia and northern China.

The episode was written by series co-creator Ryan Murphy, directed by series co-creator Brad Falchuk, and first aired on September 27, 2011 on Fox in the United States. It features the return of Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel) to the show to direct a rival glee club at William McKinley High even while New Directions, the current club, is having trouble recruiting members. Shelby also wants Quinn (Dianna Agron) and Puck (Mark Salling), the biological parents of her adopted daughter Beth, to be a part of Beth's life. The director of New Directions, Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) sets up a \\"booty camp\\" for the less capable dancers in the club, and auditions for the school musical, West Side Story, begin. The episode received mostly positive reviews, which ranged from okay to fabulous, with approval being given to the resurrection of neglected storylines from the show's first season. One of these was the adoption of Beth, and critics were especially happy with the scene where Puck meets her, but there was widespread disdain for the explanation behind Shelby's return, that of starting a rival glee club. There were only three musical numbers in the episode, though all three were given positive notices, with the overall favorite being Blaine's performance of \\"Something's Coming\\" from West Side Story at the end of the episode. All three songs were released as singles, available for download, and \\"Somewhere\\", sung as a duet by Menzel and Lea Michele, charted on the Billboard Hot 100. It did not chart on the Canadian Hot 100. Upon its initial airing, this episode was viewed by 8.60 million American viewers and garnered a 3.7/10 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. The total viewership and ratings for this episode were down from the previous week's season opener, \\"The Purple Piano Project\\". Plot Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) institutes a \\"booty camp\\" to hone the dancing skills of New Directions members Finn (Cory Monteith), Mercedes (Amber Riley), Puck (Mark Salling), Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Blaine (Darren Criss), and has Mike (Harry Shum Jr.) instruct them. As he is too busy to direct the upcoming school musical West Side Story, guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), football coach Shannon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) and New Directions member Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) take charge of it. Rachel (Lea Michele) and Kurt audition, respectively, for the lead roles of Maria and Tony; she performs \\"Somewhere\\" from the show, and he performs \\"I'm the Greatest Star\\" from Funny Girl. Kurt later eavesdrops on the directors and hears them question whether he is masculine enough for the role. He re- auditions and attempts to give a more masculine performance, but they are unable to suppress laughter at his acting. Kurt is also running for class president, and accepts campaign help from Brittany (Heather Morris), who wants to highlight his unique character by comparing him to a unicorn. Kurt feels her proposed campaign materials highlight only his gay side, and is upset when she goes against his wishes and posts them anyway. He discusses his image problem with his father, Burt (Mike O'Malley), who recommends that he embrace his uniqueness. Kurt later changes his mind about his campaign's approach and apologizes to Brittany, but is surprised to learn that she too has decided to run for class president. Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel)‚ÄîRachel's biological mother, the adoptive mother of Quinn (Dianna Agron) and Puck's daughter Beth, and the former coach of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline‚Äîis headhunted to coach a second glee club at McKinley High financed by Sugar Motta's (Vanessa Lengies) wealthy and doting father. Shelby reaches out to Rachel, Puck and Quinn. She lets Puck see Beth, but rejects Quinn's desire to do likewise due to Quinn's bad-girl attitude, appearance and behavior. Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), who is running for Congress, convinces Quinn to feature in an anti-arts video for her campaign. In it, Quinn confronts Will and blames him for her transformation into a bad girl, but Will reprimands her, reminds her of how the glee club and its members have always supported her in the past and tells her to grow up. After seeing a picture of a happy Beth and Puck, Quinn breaks down. She resumes her normal appearance, and Will and the New Directions welcome her back into the club. Puck tells Quinn he is proud of her, but Quinn reveals she is only pretending to behave in order to take Beth back from Shelby, and intends to pursue full custody. To avoid competing with Kurt, Blaine auditions for a supporting role with a rendition of \\"Something's Coming\\", one of Tony's songs from the show. The directors are impressed, and ask if he will read for the part of Tony instead. Kurt, who was watching from above, silently walks out of the auditorium. Production This episode marked the return of Broadway star Idina Menzel (pictured) as Shelby Corcoran. The episode was written by series co-creator Ryan Murphy, directed by series co-creator Brad Falchuk, and was filmed in five days, from August 22, 2011 through August 26, 2011. Broadway star Idina Menzel returns for the first time since the first season finale \\"Journey to Regionals\\", when her character, Shelby Corcoran, adopted Quinn's newborn baby, named Beth. On July 15, 2011, it was announced that Menzel would be returning to Glee in the third season \\"for a major arc that could span as many as 10-12 episodes\\". Series co- creator Ryan Murphy was quoted as saying, \\"I'm really excited [...] that Idina is joining the family again. We missed her last year and we're happy that she is coming back.\\" The article also noted that her character, Shelby, would be \\"returning from New York to Ohio to join William McKinley High School as a new teacher\\". Menzel herself said that she would \\"be back and forth in Glee all throughout the season\\", which she was \\"very excited about\\". Shelby's adopted daughter is also appearing: Menzel tweeted that she was \\"shooting scenes with babies\\". The drawing of the \\"Clown Pig\\" that Puck brings for Beth was actually drawn by Falchuk and Agron. Recurring guest stars appearing in the episode include Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), Coach Beiste (Jones), cheerleader Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter), student Sugar Motta (Lengies) and Menzel as Shelby. Second season series regular Mike O'Malley, who plays Burt Hummel and also appears in the episode, is listed in the Fox press release as a guest star for this episode and receives a like credit in the episode itself. Three singles were released from the episode: \\"I'm the Greatest Star\\" from Funny Girl sung by Colfer, and covers of \\"Something's Coming\\" and \\"Somewhere\\" from West Side Story‚Äîthe former sung by Criss, and the latter a duet between Michele and Menzel. Reception =Ratings= \\"I Am Unicorn\\" was first broadcast on September 27, 2011 in the United States on Fox. It garnered a 3.7/10 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, and received 8.60 million American viewers during its initial airing. It was beaten for the second week in a row in its timeslot by NCIS on CBS, which earned a 4.2/12 rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, and also by the second episode of New Girl, which follows Glee on Fox, and brought in a 4.5/11 rating/share and 9.28 million viewers. The Glee numbers were down from the previous week's season opener, \\"The Purple Piano Project\\", which netted a 4.0/11 rating/share and 9.21 million viewers. In the United Kingdom, \\"I Am Unicorn\\" was watched on Sky1 by 995,000 viewers, down 177,000 from the season premiere the previous week.UK viewership data: *\\"I Am Unicorn\\": *\\"The Purple Piano Project\\": In Australia, the episode drew 729,000 viewers, which made Glee the fifteenth most-watched program of the night, down from the season premiere's twelfth most-watched program of the night and 760,000 viewers in the previous week.Australian viewership data: *\\"I Am Unicorn\\": *Season premiere (\\"The Purple Piano Project\\"): In Canada, 1.50 million viewers watched the episode, and it was the eighteenth most-viewed show of the week, down eight slots and 28% from the 2.10 million who watched \\"The Purple Piano Project\\". =Critical reception= Reviewers generally received this episode positively, though some, like IGN Robert Canning, thought it was merely \\"okay\\"; he gave it a score of 6.5 out of 10, and Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times said she \\"felt vaguely underwhelmed\\" and that the episode \\"lacked emotional resonance\\". In contrast, The A.V. Club Emily VanDerWerff gave the episode a \\"B\\", and called it \\"a marked improvement over the season premiere\\", and complimented the way it \\"gave nearly all of the storylines an emotional core\\". Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times characterized it as \\"one of the tightest, best-made, most well-acted, and entertaining hours\\" from Glee in a very long time, and BuddyTV John Kubicek said that it was \\"quintessential Glee\\" and that \\"the show is once again a magical, fabulous unicorn.\\" Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle was \\"charmed\\", \\"moved\\", and \\"excited for what's to come.\\" The reappearance of storylines left dangling at the end of the first season was noted with approval by Samantha Urban of The Dallas Morning News and VanDerWerff, who both mentioned not only the big one about Quinn and Puck and baby Beth but also Artie's love of directing, and variously added Rachel and Shelby, and movement on the Will and Emma relationship. The fact that Shelby had been hired to form a second glee club at McKinley, however, was greeted with derision by both reviewers‚ÄîUrban called it \\"mind-bogglingly idiotic\\"‚Äîand others as well. Reiter found the idea incomprehensible, and Vanity Fair Brett Berk wrote, \\"Given Will's ongoing struggles to fill his own crooning baker's dozen, this is about as realistic a plan as Michele Bachmann starting a rival chapter of PFLAG at Liberty University.\\" Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger characterized the notion of \\"Shelby deciding to give up a burgeoning Broadway career because she was missing her daughter grow up\\" to take a part-time job in Lima as \\"ridiculous\\", and the whole scenario as \\"more than a little bizarre\\". The effect of Shelby's advent on Puck evoked the most praise. Benigno called the segment where Puck meets Beth \\"the best scene of this very young season\\", The Hollywood Reporter Lesley Goldberg said it was a \\"top moment\\", and Abby West of Entertainment Weekly dubbed it \\"the sweetest scene of the night\\". VanDerWerff also called it \\"very sweet\\" and expressed hope that \\"the show will come up with something for him to do after mostly relegating him to weird comic relief last season.\\" The effect of her return on Quinn was greeted with less enthusiasm. Reiter was \\"not thrilled\\" by the possibility of a custody battle between Quinn and Shelby and called Quinn's plan \\"half- baked\\", and Canning dismissed it as \\"clich√©d drama\\". Kubicek expressed interest in seeing \\"where this goes\\", and VanDerWerff noted that Quinn has been \\"grieving giving up her child all this time and she didn't even know it\\", and characterized it as a \\"fairly powerful storyline\\". Critics were divided on Kurt's storyline as he faced being perceived primarily as gay both when auditioning and when running for class president. VanDerWerff said it was \\"the most consistent\\" storyline, and Canning called it \\"the most familiar story\\", but also described Kurt as \\"by far the most interesting and most layered\\" character, his stories \\"delivering the most emotional connections\\", and this episode's installments \\"entertaining territory\\". Kubicek stated that there were \\"tons\\" of wonderful \\"Kurt moments\\" in the episode. Benigno called Kurt learning to embrace his gayness yet again on the show \\"kind of awkward\\", and Hyman asked \\"Was this Kurt Accepts He's Special 3.0 or 4.0? I can't keep track.\\" Votta summed up Kurt's audition quandary: \\"Kurt is fighting typecasting, and while the ninjitsu, fingerless gloves and climbing routine might have been an attempt to butch it up, instead Kurt played right into expectations with the over-the-top Funny Girl piece.\\" His attempt to rescue the situation by reauditioning via performing a Romeo and Juliet scene with Rachel evoked laughter from the three directors and Rachel herself, but as Votta points out, Kurt was \\"not actually being bad as Romeo\\". Jayma Mays, who plays Emma, one of the directors in that scene, stated in an interview that she thought Kurt was \\"good\\". Kurt finding himself in competition with Blaine was also touched on, but several reviewers were unhappy with the revelation that Blaine was not a senior like Kurt, as had been implied in the previous season. VanDerWerff wrote that Blaine \\"seems to have simultaneously gotten younger and had a complete personality transplant over the summer\\", Votta noted \\"the continuity-bending plot point that he's somehow a Junior and not a Senior like his boyfriend\\", and Urban allowed her exasperation to show: \\"Oh really, Glee? Blaine's a junior? Blaine's younger than Kurt? Fine. FINE.\\" MTV Jim Cantiello went into rhyme to express his dismay: \\"It's hard to keep my bearings straight / And oh, how it makes my heart ache / Kurt and Blaine were gonna move to New York together / But now they'll have to wait\\", referring to a scene in the \\"New York\\" episode where Kurt discussed the planned move with Rachel. Goldberg was pleased that having Brittany volunteer to run Kurt's campaign included an acknowledgment that he \\"went through hell\\" the previous year, and praised \\"Brittany logic\\" in general. Respers France loved that Brittany, in helping Kurt find his magical inner unicorn, was able to find her own. Reiter enjoyed the \\"delicious dose of Brittany-isms\\", which she called \\"the best part\\" of the episode, and Kubicek said that there were \\"tons of wonderful\\" Brittany moments. For Hyman, the \\"one sit-up-and-take-notice moment\\" was the confrontation between Will and Quinn where he told her to grow up. Respers France thought \\"Sue Sylvester's attempt to use Quinn against the glee club was hilarious\\", but VanDerWerff was unhappy with Quinn being coopted into \\"Sue‚Äôs ridiculous run for Congress\\". Reiter wrote that it was \\"hard to muster much sympathy for Quinn\\" in the episode given the scene with Quinn and The Skanks: \\"Flushing someone's head in a public toilet, threatening to cut them, and shaking them down for their lunch money are orders of magnitude more chilling than the face-full-of-slushy bullying we're used to seeing.\\" =Music and performances= The episode's musical performances were well received by most reviewers. All three were Broadway songs, two from West Side Story and one from Funny Girl‚Äîthe concentration on show tunes disappointed Reiter, and Canning felt they were all \\"too bland\\", but others were happy with the selections including Hankinson who said he was \\"loving the Broadway-bend to these first two episodes\\", and added, \\"all three of tonight's numbers were hands-down fantastic.\\" The duet of \\"Somewhere\\" featuring Rachel and Shelby was generally complimented. Both Benigno and Rae Votta of Billboard compared it favorably to their previous duet, Lady Gaga's \\"Poker Face\\", from season one. Benigno gave the performance a \\"B+\\", while Michael Slezak of TVLine gave it an \\"A‚àí\\" and praised their \\"powerful, evocative voices\\". Rolling Stone Erica Futterman was not impressed, and characterized it as \\"Lite FM snooze that does nothing to showcase these Broadway belters in a new and exciting way\\". Amy Lee of The Huffington Post called it \\"pretty bland\\", and said it was \\"getting annoying\\" that Rachel \\"sings every song as if she's Barbra Streisand\\". The Wall Street Journal Raymund Flandez, however, called the duet \\"pitch-perfect\\" and \\"so sublime it makes you catch your breath\\". Kurt's choice of \\"I'm the Greatest Star\\" to audition for the role of Tony‚Äîthe one song not from West Side Story‚Äîdrew comment: Benigno ascribed it to Kurt's \\"ability to make a talented ass of himself\\", while Slezak was of the opinion that Kurt was \\"way too savvy, and way too hungry for the role\\" for that kind of misstep. Despite these plot-related issues, both reviewers gave the performance an \\"A\\", and Benigno noted both that \\"he nails it\\" and \\"last half of the song is a singing clinic.\\" VanDerWerff was not fond of the reliance on \\"gimmicky staging\\", though Futterman called it \\"an impressive physical performance\\", Votta stated that \\"Kurt sounds flawless and the performance is captivating\\" and Flandez complimented his \\"captivating high notes after high notes\\", and added, \\"He's a star unicorn, and he knows it.\\" Lisa Respers France of CNN wrote that Kurt \\"was amazing singing Streisand, and for the first time I realized that he really is as big a star as Rachel.\\" Blaine's rendition of \\"Something's Coming\\" was the most enthusiastically welcomed. It was the favorite number of Lee, VanDerWerff and Futterman; Lee said it was \\"the best song\\", and added, \\"he's kinetic, impassioned and generally delightful as Blaine-playing-Tony.\\" VanDerWerff was even more complimentary with \\"by far the best performance\\", and Futterman called it \\"the winning musical number of the episode\\". Both Slezak and Benigno gave it a \\"B+\\", and the former complimented Criss's \\"breathless charm and boyish enthusiasm\\", while the latter maintained that the actor is \\"at his best when he's doing goofy pop numbers with kind of an off- beat twist\\". West gave the song an \\"A‚àí\\", and said \\"Blaine just knows how to own the stage and your TV screen\\", while both Votta and Respers France wrote that he was the \\"perfect Tony\\". =Chart history= One of the three cover versions released as singles debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, and none charted on the Canadian Hot 100 or in England or Australia. The duet version of \\"Somewhere\\" appeared at number seventy-five, the fourth time the song charted in the Hot 100. By contrast, \\"Something's Coming\\", the episode's other song from West Side Story, has never appeared in the Hot 100, and failed to chart there again.

Discovery  Siamodon is known from the holotype PRC-4, a well-preserved left maxilla and from the referred materials PRC-5, an isolated maxillary tooth and PRC-6, a braincase. It was collected in the Ban Saphan Hin site, Nakhon Ratchasima Province, from the Khok Kruat Formation, dating to the Aptian stage of the late Early Cretaceous, about 125-113 million years ago.  Description  Siamodon shows a combination of plesiomorphic and apomorphic features, including a maxilla shaped like an isosceles triangle, with the dorsal process located at about mid-length of the bone; a strong longitudinal bulge on the medial surface of the maxilla; at least 25 maxillary teeth, which bear a prominent median primary ridge, and one short weak subsidiary ridge or no subsidiary ridge at all, and mamillated denticles on the crown margins. The maxilla is 230 millimeters long, and has a height of 100 millimeters. The height of the isolated tooth is about 25-28 millimeters, and the width is about 14-17 millimeters. Siamodon differs from more basal iguanodontians, such as Iguanodon and closely related forms, in the morphology of its maxillary teeth, which are narrower and bear a strong median primary ridge, sometimes accompanied by a weak subsidiary ridge, instead of a distally displaced primary ridge and several subsidiary ridges, and the apex of the maxilla is in a more posterior position. Its maxilla differs from that of hadrosaurids in the articular area for the jugal, with forms a tab-like jugal process. Whereas in hadrosaurids, the expanded anterior end of the jugal contacts and overlaps a large sutural area on the maxilla. The combination of characters seen in the maxilla of Siamodon nimngami indicate that it belongs to a group of iguanodontians more derived than Iguanodon but basal to Hadrosauridae. It may be closely related to Probactrosaurus from China but they differ in the number of tooth positions.  Etymology  Siamodon was first named by √âric Buffetaut and Varavudh Suteethorn in 2011. The type species is Siamodon nimngami. The generic name is derived from Siam, the ancient name of Thailand; and ', Greek for \\"tooth\\". The specific name is in honour of Witaya Nimngam, who donated the specimens to the authors.

It serves the Fairmount Line. It is located near Codman Square in the Dorchester neighborhood. The station includes two full-length high-level platforms located north of Talbot Avenue, which are also accessible from Park Street and West Park Street. The station opened on November 12, 2012 as the first of four new stations on the Fairmount Line. Talbot Avenue was the first completely new rail station to open in the City of Boston since Yawkey opened in 1988. History =Previous service= Remains of Dorchester station in 2018 Service on the Fairmount Line (as the Dorchester Branch of the Norfolk County Railroad and later the New York and New England Railroad and New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad) began in 1855 and lasted until 1944. Stations were located at Harvard Street and Dorcester (Woodrow Avenue), which are one quarter-mile to the north and south, of the new station site. The new station is the first station on the line located at Talbot Avenue. =Restoration and plans= The bridge over Talbot Avenue was replaced in a single weekend in December 2011 Temporary shuttle service resumed on the Fairmount Line in 1979 during Southwest Corridor construction, with stops at Uphams Corner, Morton Street, and Fairmount. The MBTA planned to drop the shuttle after service resumed on the Southwest Corridor in 1987, but the service was locally popular and the Fairmount Line became a permanent part of the system. A plan called the Indigo Line was later advanced by community activists in which the line would add stations and more frequent service to closely resemble a conventional rapid transit line. The Indigo Line plan was not adopted, but elements of it were included when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts agreed in 2005 to make improvements on the Fairmount Line part of its legally binding commitment to mitigate increased air pollution from the Big Dig. Among the selected improvements in the Fairmount Line Improvements project were four new commuter rail stations on the line, including one at Talbot Avenue as well as Newmarket, Four Corners/Geneva, and Blue Hill Avenue. The stations were originally to be completed by the end of 2011. =Talbot Avenue station= Outbound platform under construction in May 2012 A $15.9 million contract for construction of the station and the replacement of the adjacent Talbot Avenue overpass was awarded in August 2010. Construction began in November 2010, with a footbridge connecting Park Street to West Park Street removed in December. An official groundbreaking was held in June 2011. The bridge over Talbot Avenue was replaced during the third weekend of December 2011, using techniques developed in MassDOT's Fast 14 highway bridge replacement program. The station was 80% complete by April 2012. By September, the station was 92% finished, with only minor cosmetic work remaining. On September 13, the MBTA announced that the station was planned to open in October 2012. The station did not open in October; on November 7, the MBTA announced the opening date. The station opened on schedule on November 12, 2012. In April 2013, a 6-foot fence on both platforms was erected in response to privacy concerns from residents of abutting properties. Ribbon-cutting ceremonies were held at Newmarket, Four Corners/Geneva, and Talbot Avenue on July 17, 2013.

She discovered artemisinin (also known as qƒ´nghƒÅos√π ÈùíËíøÁ¥†) and dihydroartemisinin, used to treat malaria, a breakthrough in twentieth-century tropical medicine, saving millions of lives in South China, Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America. For her work, Tu received the 2011 Lasker Award in clinical medicine and the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine jointly with William C. Campbell and Satoshi ≈åmura. Tu is the first Chinese Nobel laureate in physiology or medicine and the first female citizen of the People's Republic of China to receive a Nobel Prize in any category. She is also the first Chinese person to receive the Lasker Award. Tu Youyou was born, educated and carried out her research exclusively in China.  Early life  Tu was born in Ningbo, Zhejiang, China, on 30 December 1930. She attended Xiaoshi Middle School for junior high school and the first year of high school, before transferring to Ningbo Middle School in 1948. A tuberculosis infection interrupted her high-school education, but inspired her to go into medical research. From 1951 to 1955, she attended Peking University Medical School / Beijing Medical College. In 1955, Youyou Tu graduated from Beijing Medical University School of Pharmacy and continued her research on Chinese herbal medicine in the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. Tu studied at the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, and graduated in 1955. Later Tu was trained for two and a half years in traditional Chinese medicine. After graduation, Tu worked at the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (now the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medical Sciences) in Beijing. Tu and her husband, Li Tingzhao (), a metallurgical engineer, live in Beijing. Li was Tu's classmate at Xiaoshi Middle School. They have two daughters. Tu's maternal grandfather, Yao Yongbai (ÂßöÂíèÁôΩ), was the first Director of National Treasury Administration after its reform. Her uncle, Yao Qingsan (ÂßöÂ∫Ü‰∏â), was an economist and banker.  Research career  Tu carried on her work in the 1960s and 70s during China's Cultural Revolution, when scientists were denigrated as one of the nine black categories in society according to Maoist theory (or possibly that of the Gang of Four). = Schistosomiasis = During her early years in research, Tu studied Lobelia chinensis, a traditional Chinese medicine for curing schistosomiasis, caused by trematodes which infect the urinary tract or the intestines, which was widespread in the first half of the 20th century in South China. = Malaria = In 1967, during the Vietnam War, Ho Chi Minh, the leader of North Vietnam (which was at war against South Vietnam and the United States), asked Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai for help in developing a malaria treatment for his soldiers trooping down the Ho Chi Minh trail, where a majority came down with a form of malaria which is resistant to chloroquine. Because malaria was also a major cause of death in China's southern provinces, especially Guangdong, and Guangxi, Zhou Enlai convinced Mao Zedong to set up a secret drug discovery project named Project 523 after its starting date, 23May 1967.\\"The modest woman who beat malaria for China\\", by Phil McKenna, New Scientist, 15 November 2011 In early 1969, Tu was appointed head of the Project 523 research group at her institute. Tu was initially sent to Hainan where she studied patients who had been infected with the disease. Scientists worldwide had screened over 240,000 compounds without success. In 1969, Tu, then 39 years old, had an idea of screening Chinese herbs. She first investigated the Chinese medical classics in history, visiting practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine all over the country on her own. She gathered her findings in a notebook called A Collection of Single Practical Prescriptions for Anti-Malaria. Her notebook summarized 640 prescriptions. By 1971, her team had screened over 2,000 traditional Chinese recipes and made 380 herbal extracts, from some 200 herbs, which were tested on mice. One compound was effective, sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua), which was used for \\"intermittent fevers,\\" a hallmark of malaria. As Tu also presented at the project seminar, its preparation was described in a 1,600-year-old text, in a recipe titled, \\"Emergency Prescriptions Kept Up One's Sleeve\\". At first, it was ineffective because they extracted it with traditional boiling water. Tu Youyou discovered that a low-temperature extraction process could be used to isolate an effective antimalarial substance from the plant; Tu says she was influenced by a traditional Chinese herbal medicine source, The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency Treatments, written in 340 by Ge Hong, which states that this herb should be steeped in cold water. This book contained the direction to immerse a handful of qinghao in the equivalent of 0.4 litres of water, wring out the juice and drink it all. After rereading the recipe, Tu realised the hot water had already damaged the active ingredient in the plant; therefore she proposed a method using low-temperature ether to extract the effective compound instead. The animal tests showed it was completely effective in mice and monkeys. In 1972, she and her colleagues obtained the pure substance and named it qinghaosu (ÈùíËíøÁ¥†), or artemisinin as it is commonly called in the West, which has saved millions of lives, especially in the developing world. Tu also studied the chemical structure and pharmacology of artemisinin. Tu's group first determined the chemical structure of artemisinin. In 1973, Tu wanted to confirm the carbonyl group in the artemisinin molecule, therefore she accidentally synthesized dihydroartemisinin. Furthermore, Tu volunteered to be the first human subject. \\"As head of this research group, I had the responsibility\\" she said. It was safe, so she conducted successful clinical trials with human patients. Her work was published anonymously in 1977. In 1981, she presented the findings relating to artemisinin at a meeting with the World Health Organization. For her work on malaria, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine on 5 October 2015.  Later career  She was promoted to a Researcher (, the highest researcher rank in mainland China equivalent to the academic rank of a full professor) in 1980 shortly after the Chinese economic reform began in 1978. In 2001 she was promoted to academic advisor for doctoral candidates. Currently she is the Chief Scientist in the Academy. As of 2007, her office is in an old apartment building in Dongcheng District, Beijing. Before 2011, Tu Youyou had been obscure for decades, and is described as \\"almost completely forgotten by people\\". Tu is regarded as the \\"Three- Without Scientist\\" ‚Äì no postgraduate degree (there was no postgraduate education then in China), no study or research experience abroad, and not a member of either the Chinese national academies, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering. Tu is now regarded as a representative figure of the first generation of Chinese medical workers since the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949.

The local population suffered greatly during this period, while the Axis Powers initiated a policy of large scale plunder. Moreover, requisitions, together with the Allied blockade of Greece, the ruined state of the country's infrastructure, and the emergence of a powerful and well-connected black market, resulted in the Great Famine, with the mortality rate reaching a peak during the winter of 1941‚Äì42.Mazower, 1995: 44‚Äì48 The great suffering and the pressure of the Greek diaspora eventually forced the British to lift the blockade partially, and from the summer of 1942, the International Red Cross was able to distribute supplies in sufficient quantities; however, the situation remained grim until the end of the occupation. Background Italian, red the German and green the Bulgarian zone. Fascist Italy invaded Greece from Albania on 28 October 1940. However, the invasion was quickly turned into a humiliating defeat for the Italians and the Greek forces managed to penetrate deep into Albanian territory. On 6 April 1941, Germany attacked Greece and the Greek forces fell back quickly under the astonishing firepower of the Blitzkrieg. Immediately following their victory, the occupation powers divided the country into 3 zones between which any movement of goods and people was strictly prohibited. The Germans occupied parts of Athens, the region around Thessaloniki, a few strategic outposts in the Aegean and the island of Crete, the Bulgarians held the northern regions of Thrace and Eastern Macedonia, while the Italians controlled most of the mainland and the Ionian Islands. German War Flag over the Acropolis. Official Propaganda-Photo In general, the Axis powers viewed conquered nations as sources of raw materials, food and labor. As a matter of policy, subjugated nations were to provide material support to Germany and Italy. According to this principle, already from the outset of the occupation, German and Italian troops initiated a policy of wide-scale plunder of everything of value. Moreover, pillage, torture, executions, and civilian massacres throughout Greece were also part of the Axis agenda during the years of occupation. The German attitude toward occupied peoples was expressed succinctly in the words of Hermann G√∂ring in a letter to the Reich commissioners and military commanders of the occupied territories on 6 August 1942:Kojak, 2006: 4‚Äì5 First months of occupation German soldiers in a shop Within the occupation zones, the confiscation of fuel and all means of transportation, including fishing boats and pack animals, prevented any transfer of food and other supplies and reduced mobility to a minimum. The occupiers seized strategic industries and appropriated or bought them at low prices, paying with occupation marks they circulated all stocks of commodities like tobacco, olive oil, cotton, and leather and transferred them to their home countries. Laird Archer, who worked for an American aid agency and was in Athens when the Germans entered the city on 27 April 1941, noted in his Journal: Unemployment rose to extreme levels, while extraordinary levies were extorted from the Greek collaborationist government to sustain the occupying forces.Neelsen, Stratmann, 2010: 8.Hionidou, 2006: 65. Occupied Greece was not only burdened with the occupation costs of the German and Italian armies but also with the expenses of Axis military projects in the Eastern Mediterranean. Unlike the rest of the occupied countries, whose costs were limited to their actual defense appropriations prior to the Axis invasion, the size of Greece's levy in 1941‚Äì1942 reached 113.7% of the local national income. On the other hand, the Allied forces responded with a full naval blockade in order to weaken the Axis in its military efforts. This cut off all imports to Greece, including foods. Farmers in Greece had to pay a 10% in kind tax on their produce and to sell to the collaborationist government at fixed prices all production above the subsistence level. The food price controls and rationing that had been in place before the Greek defeat were now tightened. With the low government prices and newly imposed taxes, farmers went to great lengths to hide their produce from the officials and traders pulled their merchandise from the shelves, a factor that added to the severing of the foreign trade routes on which Greece traditionally dependeded for food imports. Thus, the scarcity of food supplies resulted in the increase of their prices, while the circulation of the German Occupation Reichsmark and the Italian Casa Mediterranea Drachma led soon to inflation. Under these circumstances, black market and rationing became the only means of food supply in the urban areas of Greece.Hionidou, 2002: 183 Fishing was also prohibited, at least during the early period of occupation.Hionidou, 2002: 182 Moreover, the Bulgarians forbade any transportation of grain from their zone, where 30% of the Greek pre-war production took place, to the rest of the country.Voglis, 2006: p. 23 In mid- September 1941, when the famine was imminent, Berlin responded to enquiries of German officials in Greece:Wever, Goethem, Wouters, p. 208 Under these conditions, and contrary to the rational exploitation of the national resources applied to the occupied countries in Western and Northern Europe, the Germans in Greece resorted to a policy of plunder. Although the collaborationist government under Georgios Tsolakoglou requested from the Axis to import grain before the winter this didn't have any serious impact: Germany and Italy sent a very low amount of grain while Bulgaria sent nothing at all. The few organized efforts by the Orthodox Church and Red Cross were unable to meet the needs of the population. Determining factors of the food crisis were low food availability and curtailment of communications, partly due to the severe lack of transport facilities but especially because it was imposed on both goods and persons. Other factors were the attempt of the local government and the occupying forces to regulate the market and its prices.Hionidou, 2006: Winter of 1941‚Äì1942 A dead body of a starved child The nutritional situation became critical in the summer of 1941 and in the fall turned into a full-blown famine.Neelsen, Stratmann, 2010: 9 Especially in the first winter of occupation (1941‚Äì42) food shortage was acute and famine struck especially in the urban centers of the country.Matallas, Grivetti: 132 Food shortage reached a climax and a famine was unavoidable. During that winter the mortality rate reached a peak, while according to British historian, Mark Mazower, this was the worst famine the Greeks experienced from ancient times. Bodies of dead persons were secretly abandoned in cemeteries or at the streets (possibly so their ration cards could continue to be used by surviving relatives). In other cases, bodies were found days after the death had taken place.Hionidou, 2006: 13 The sight of emaciated dead bodies was commonplace in the streets of Athens.Voglis, 2006: p. 23Palairet, 2000: 26 The situation in Athens and the wider area with its port, Piraeus, was out of control, the hyperinflation was in full swing and the price of bread was increased 89-fold from April 1941 to June 1942. According to the records of the German army the mortality rate in Athens alone reached 300 deaths per day during December 1941, while the estimates of the Red Cross were much higher, at 400 deaths while in some days the death toll reached 1,000. Apart from the urban areas the population of the islands was also affected by the famine, especially those living in Mykonos, Syros and Chios. There are no accurate numbers of the famine deaths because civil registration records did not function during the occupation.Hionidou, 2006: 25 In general, it is estimated that Greece suffered approximately 300,000 deaths during the Axis occupation as a result of famine and malnutrition. However, not all parts of Greece experienced equal levels of food scarcity. Although comprehensive data on regional famine severity does not exist, the available evidence indicates that the severe movement restrictions, the proximity to agricultural production and the level of urbanization were crucial factors of famine mortality. Lifting of the Allied blockade Universal Newsreel about distribution of food to the Greek people in 1944 Britain was initially reluctant to lift the blockade; however, a compromise was reached to allow shipments of grain to come from the neutral Turkey. The first ship with food supplies that was permitted to reach Greece was the SS Kurtulu≈ü from Turkey, at September 1941. Foodstuffs were collected by a nationwide campaign of Kƒ±zƒ±lay (Turkish Red Crescent) and the operation was mainly funded by the American Greek War Relief Association and the Hellenic Union of Constantinopolitans. Initially a total of 50,000 tons of food supplies were planned to be shipped from Turkey;http://e-dergi.atauni.edu.tr/ataunitaed/article/download/1020007324/1020006578 p.10 however 17,500 tons were able to deliver.http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/57jnx2.htmhttp://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/45/15690.pdf p.17 This assistance remained symbolic since one ship was unable to alleviate such an extreme situation.Voglis, 2006: p. 24 Because of the efforts of the Greek Diaspora in the United States and Great Britain, the situation of the starving civilian population in Greece soon became a public issue in the Allied countries. The increasing public pressure finally led to the lifting of the naval blockade in February 1942. The plan carried under the auspices of the International Red Cross, while Sweden offered for the transportation of 15,000 tons of Canadian wheat. Wheat shipments soon began and together with the rising temperatures of springtime, resulted in the reduction of the mortality rates. At the end of 1942 with the steady supply of sufficient quantities to the country's greatest ports, the mortality rate fell, however the food situation remained grim until the end of the occupation (1944). The international relief was focused mainly on children. In Athens the Red Cross started to provide daily milk rations, medical services and clothing to children younger than two years. In following March the occupiers and Allied forces agreed to the establishment of the Swedish-run Joint Relief Commission to reorganize the public food supply system. On the other hand, the occupiers moreover committed to replace all appropriated agricultural products with food imports of equal calorific value and relaxed the harshest mobility restrictions and price regulations. Nazi bailout plan and the resistance As the collapse of the Greek monetary system was imminent, the Germans were alarmed that such a possibility would render worthless the flow of drachmas to their troops. In order to deal with this situation, Hermann Neubacher, was appointed Reich's special commissioner in Greece. Neubacher's objective was to sustain Axis operation in Greece without destroying the Greek economy. His initiative was eased by the supplies provided by the International Red Cross.Palairet, 2000: 33 From 1943, large areas of the countryside witnessed reprisal operations, burning of settlements and massive executions by the Germans, like in Epirus and Thessaly.Hionidou, 2006: 17, 30. The military operations of the Germans against rural areas, from the rising guerrilla activity, sent large numbers of people into the towns or into the mountains, emptying part of the countryside of its labour force. Famine conditions appeared again during the winter of 1943‚Äì44 in Aetolia and some islands.Laiou- Thomadakis, 1980: 2 Moreover, the rural population did not receive Red Cross supplies like the cities, either because the Germans retaliated against villages suspected of supporting guerrillas or because they feared that the supplies would fall into the hands of the resistance. On the other hand, the largest Greek resistance organization, the National Liberation Front (EAM), took the initiative and distributed food and clothing to the regions it controlled at that time.Laiou-Thomadakis, 1980: 3. Impact on literature and thought In the everyday Greek language the word \\"occupation\\" is almost synonymous with famine and hunger due to the harsh situation the Greek population faced during these years. Stockpiling unnecessary amounts of food, and an irrational fear upon seeing an empty pantry, is still colloquially called occupation syndrome by Greek people, since these behaviours were especially common during the postwar years. Moreover, various works mention the severe situation faced by the Greek population during the years of occupation. One of these is the novel Zorba the Greek, by Nikos Kazantzakis, which reflected the general danger and starvation of that time.

Iveco's H-Drive System provides power to individual wheels, simulating a tracked vehicle, so it can continue operating if any wheels are damaged or blown off and has better mobility in soft soil or sand. Since the H-Drive System eliminates axles through use of a string of three shafts on each side, a V-shaped hull is able to be used for blast protection, and the floor is also not connected to the hull, instead bolting onto the bottom of the seats, creating less headroom for occupants but absorbing more energy from an underbody blast. Space in the interior is taken up by pipes, wires, and things needed to make systems run, but that is because the space behind the seats is reserved for Marines' gear. Fuel tanks are external for passenger protection, and unlike the AAV, the SuperAV doesn't expel black smoke upon engine start and has a quietly running engine.

Biography Frank Driggs first became enamored with jazz and swing music listening to late-night broadcasts from hotels and ballrooms in the 1930s. A 1952 Princeton University graduate with a degree in political science, Driggs moved to Manhattan where he worked first as an NBC page.Adler, Jerry. \\"Jazz Man\\", Smithsonian.com., September, 2005. Accessed September 12, 2011. Later he joined with Marshall Stearns, founder of the Institute of Jazz Studies, and others in documenting jazz history. In the late 1950s, the record producer John Hammond hired Driggs to assist him at Columbia Records. Soon Driggs was producing records, organizing recording sessions and putting out important re- issues of 78 rpm recordings by Fletcher Henderson, Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington and Gene Krupa. His work at Columbia included Robert Johnson: The Complete Recordings which earned him a Grammy Award in 1991. Driggs later produced recordings for Epic, Okeh, MCA, Stash, and Time-Life Records, before reviving the Bluebird label for RCA Records in the early 1970s. Soon after Driggs moved to Manhattan in 1952, he began gathering and saving posters, flyers and ticket stubs, recordings and amateur photographs, providing invaluable information to journalists and music fans decades later that would have otherwise been lost. While much of his collection was publicity stills of Jazz music artists, Drigg's holdings also contained a sizable collection of blues, rock, dance and movie artists. By 2005 his collection had included over 100,000 images. Many of the photographed are not labeled or indexed since Driggs relied on his own system of sorting and his own personal memory of the musicians in the pictures.\\"Photos of Jazz's Memory Lane, for Sale\\" National Public Radio, March 15, 2005.

For many years Driggs kept his collection of images in his basement of his home in Flatbush until 2005 when he moved in with the late musicologist and writer Joan Peyser in the Manhattan borough of New York City. In 2005, Driggs collection of photographs was appraised at $1.5 million and Driggs made provisions for the collection to be donated to Jazz at Lincoln Center after his death.

She is the author of 30 books including poetry, plays, novels, and books about writing. Since 1996 she has trained people how to write business content for a digital and electronic world. In 2007 she launched Contented Enterprises jointly with Alice Hearnshaw to provide scalable, cost-effective online training courses for business writers.  Biography  McAlpine was born in Fairlie and grew up with her five sisters in small-town vicarages in Canterbury, New Zealand. When she was 10 the family moved to Christchurch, where she attended Christchurch Girls' High School and the University of Canterbury, graduating BA and Senior Scholar. She was married twice: to civil engineer Grant McAlpine (1969‚Äì1981) and to artist Michael Smither (1988‚Äì1992). After four years in Geneva she moved to Masterton, New Zealand. There she raised four children, taught high school, wrote her first poetry book, and gained a Dip. Ed (Massey University) and B.A. Hons (Victoria University of Wellington). McAlpine says that her career swerved abruptly in May 1995, when she first saw a web site. As a writer, she immediately realized that traditional writing styles would need to change for this new medium. She began teaching short courses on writing and managing web content in 1996, writing her first book on the topic, Web Word Wizardry, in 1999. As Curriculum Director of Contented Enterprises, McAlpine created online writing courses. Contented teaches writing skills needed for blogs, social media, intranets, web sites, email, e-learning, and all documents that are managed electronically. Contented courses go beyond the traditional print-based curriculum for business writing: they show how to make content accessible and searchable. McAlpine's courses and conference speeches are original and playful (as befits a poet), while delivering solid information. Besides her professional work, McAlpine writes two personal blogs. She lives in Wellington, dances with the Crows Feet Dance Collective, walks a lot and does Tai Chi. She also lobbies for plain language communication from government agencies.

It is a real-time final settlement payment system that continuously matches, off- sets and settles payments among international and domestic banks. CHIPS provides real-time, immediate and final settlement of payment messages continuously throughout the day similar to Fedwire. During the business day, system participants can send their payments to CHIPS. Funds are released by available funds on hand (no overdrafts are permitted) or through offsetting. A ‚Äúbalance release algorithm‚Äù continuously searches the queue of unreleased payments and uses this patented off-setting algorithm to match and release payments. CHIPS‚Äô ability to perform real-time bilateral and multi-lateral off- setting means that very large payments can be released earlier in the day, and that participants realize greater liquidity efficiency savings than those possible in pure RTGS systems. With real-time off-setting, the system continuously offsets payments between two or more CHIPS participants. A payment is considered final and irrevocable at the instant CHIPS releases it. Since CHIPS‚Äô inception The Clearing House management has implemented a number of credit, systemic and liquidity risk reduction measures to better manage individual participant risk, eliminate daylight overdraft exposure, and virtually eliminate systemic risk. =Electronic Payments Network= Electronic Payments Network (EPN) is an automated clearing house (ACH), i.e. a computerized, batch-processing funds-transfer system that processes domestic consumer and commercial financial transactions among depository institutions. Rather than sending each payment separately, ACH transactions are accumulated and sorted by destination for transmission during a predetermined time period. The Automated Clearing Exchange System (ACES) is the core computerized system for EPN processing of payments between account holders at depository financial institutions. EPN serves approximately 450 processing customers. EPN participants include Depository Financial Institutions (DFI) throughout the United States and its territories as part of a nationwide network for domestic commercial banks, thrifts, credit unions and agencies of foreign institutions. =SVPCO= SVPCO is The Clearing House's line of business that operates CHECCS, which is a computerized settlement system that streamlines the check clearing, collection and return process, and enables the secure exchange of digital check images between financial institutions. SVPCO also operates Online Adjustments and Online Settlement. The SVPCO products provide a complete settlement and reconcilement solution for financial institutions. _SVPCO Image Payments Network_ is an SVPCO product that allows participants to use a single connection to directly exchange check images with all SVPCO image exchange participants. SVPCO Image exchange participants may also send images to financial institutions that are not members of SVPCO through links with the Fed, correspondent banks and third-party processors. SVPCO Online Adjustments provides a secure online database to automate cash letter adjustments. The online adjustments system integrates with a range of case management solutions. The cash letter adjustments eliminate paper forms and attachments. Adjustments data is automatically input into case management systems and can be matched with open systems to minimize the possibility of fraudulent adjustments. SVPCO Online Settlement is integrated with the SVPCO Image Payments Network and provides automated settlement for cash letter activity. It also works in tandem with SVPCO Online Adjustments, which allows institutions to reconcile adjustments the same day by eliminating the need for paper forms and attachments. Check exchanges The New York Clearing House Association was organized at the Bank Officers meeting on October 4, 1853. There were fifty-seven banks in New York City in 1853. Fifty-two became members of the Association. The first check exchanges at The Clearing House were held on October 11, 1853. The Clearing House does not exchange physical checks any longer. The original check exchanges have evolved into a new computerized check settlement system operated by SVPCO called the Clearing House Electronic Check Clearing System (CHECCS).

Around its 14 partners, Architecture-Studio brings together an international team of architects, urban planners, interior designers, quantity surveyors and sustainable design specialists of twenty five different nationalities. The Seat of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, the Arab World Institute in Paris (together with Jean Nouvel), and the Notre-Dame- de-l'Arche-d'Alliance Church in Paris stand among Architecture-Studio's best known projects. Architecture-Studio has been developing over the years and has established an office in Shanghai, and CA'ASI in Venice, Italy. Philosophy Architecture-Studio defines architecture as \\"an art that is socially committed and engaged in the construction of mankind's living environment\\". Architecture-Studio's work is based on group culture, developing a real team work through a collective conception of Architecture; a will to go beyond individual interests in favour of dialogue and debate, thereby transforming all individual knowledge into collective creative potential. Architecture- Studio believes that this also involves being open to encounters that can alter the way of thinking or, at least, inflect it (a book, a film, a man, a mistake on a building site‚Ä¶). This approach is a key to the conception process; a process which is not linear but iterative, not static but dynamic, not only intellectual and abstract but organic and concrete.

It is the largest public indoor shooting range in the United States, with 61 total indoor shooting lanes. H&H; is recognized by the National Association of Shooting Ranges and the National Shooting Sports Foundation as the first ever 'Five Star Facility'. The complex includes forty two public shooting lanes for firearms and twenty-one archery lanes for sixty three total lanes.  History  H&H; was established in 1981 by Miles and Jayne Hall of Oklahoma City when they were 20 and 18 years old. The first location was on 10th Street just west of Council Road. The facility held 10 lanes and a classroom and a lobby. In April 1990 H&H; moved to its current location, 400 South Vermont Ave, Suite 110. The current location faces I-40 and is 90,000 square feet, it features 61 shooting lanes, three classrooms, a retail area, and an in-store cafe. The building is filled with animal mounts from all over the world and offers a sensory safari for sight impaired children. Miles Hall announced in August, 2016 that H&H; chairman Leroy Ussery had taken on the role of president. The Halls agreed to sell their stock in H&H; Shooting Sports. Ussery continued to serve as the chairman of the board for H&H.;  Education When H&H; was first established the main focus was to develop the sport of shooting and to teach firearm safety programs at every level. Their offerings include private instruction for beginning shooters, a concealed carry course, and advanced training courses. H&H; also offers free programs to all members of the Boy Scouts of America to assist in earning merit badges in archery, rifle shooting and shotgun shooting. Facility  = Indoor shooting range = Shooter at the Range There are a total of 42 firing lanes and targets can be set as far as from the shooter. The range's backstop is composed of recycled rubber from the side walls of tires. H&H; can accommodate all shotgun and handgun calibers, plus all rifle calibers less energetic than 300 Weatherby Magnum/300 Remington Ultra Magnum. Each lane has an advanced system that controls that lane's respective target, increasing safety. This system is also more time efficient because it removes the need to walk down range to check or change targets. The range utilizes a system of air filters to keep the air fresh and clean by moving gasses away from shooters immediately. = Archery Department = The Archery Department was added in 2008 when H&H; purchased competitor Outdoor Outfitters. There are a total of 21 archery lanes. = Other = The store has expanded their services to include a Knife Pro Shop. The facility also has a gunsmith onsite and an instore cafe.

Operated by the European Space Research Organisation, TD-1A made astronomical surveys primarily in the ultraviolet, but also using x-ray and gamma ray detectors. Spacecraft TD-1A was named after the Thor-Delta series of rockets, a derivative of which was used to launch it. It was a satellite which measured by by . The spacecraft was three- axis stabilised, with sun sensors used to maintain a constant attitude with respect to the Sun. =Instruments= Diagram of the TD-1A satellite with its various detectors labeled. Seven instruments were carried aboard TD-1A, with a combined mass of . The Stellar UV Radiation Experiment, operated by University College London and the University of Li√®ge, consisted of a ultraviolet telescope, attached to a spectrometer. It was used to study extinction and to produce a star catalogue using ultraviolet observations. UV range 135 to 255 nm. The UV Stellar Spectrometer was operated by the Astronomical Institute of Utrecht University. It consisted of a grating spectrometer attached to a Cassegrain reflector telescope. UV measurements at 216, 255 & 286 nm. Spectrometry of Primary Charged Particles was an experiment conducted by the Saclay Nuclear Research Centre, which studied cosmic rays, and measured their charge spectra. Spectrometry of Celestial X-Rays was another payload operated by the Saclay Nuclear Research Centre. It consisted of two slot collimators and a proportional counter, which were used to study the spectra of incident x-rays. Due to an encoder malfunction, the experiment was not operational for most of the first survey; it was deactivated a few months after launch and remained inactive until 1 July 1973; at the start of the second survey. Solar Gamma-Rays in the 50 to 500 MeV Energy Range was an experiment operated by the University of Milan which was used to measure the flux of solar gamma ray emissions. It consisted of scintillators and photomultipliers, which measured the radiation. The Solar X-Ray Monitor was operated by the Utrecht University. It used a scintillation counter to detect hard x-rays emitted by the Sun. The Saclay Nuclear Research Centre's Gamma-Ray Measurement experiment used a spark chamber to detect gamma rays during the sky survey. Launch A Delta N, also known as the Thor-Delta N, was used to place it into orbit. The launch occurred at 01:55:08 UTC, from Space Launch Complex 2E at Vandenberg Air Force Base. The launch of TD-1A marked the final flight of the Delta N, and the last launch from Space Launch Complex 2E. TD-1A was placed into a low Earth orbit; on 11 April 1974 it was tracked in an orbit with a perigee of , an apogee of , 97.5 degrees of inclination, and a period of 95.32 minutes. Operation TD-1A operated for twenty six months, conducting two complete sky surveys, and completing approximately half of a third scan, in all mapping 95 percent of the sky. By maintaining a constant orientation to the sun, TD-1A was able to scan a thin band of the sky on each orbit, and Earth's movement around the sun enabled it to scan the entire sky over a period of six months. TD-1A was affected by reliability issues with an onboard tape recorder, used to store experimental data for transmission to Earth, however the fault was intermittent, and still enabled the completion of the spacecraft's mission. An encoder problem led to the Spectrometry of Celestial X-rays experiment not being run during the first survey, however this was activated in time for the second survey, and was still completed successfully. In May 1974, TD-1A ceased operations when its attitude control system depleted its last remaining propellant, leaving it unable to maintain its orientation. It decayed from orbit and reentered the atmosphere on 9 January 1980.

Established in 1939, the company was located near the Salem, Oregon airport. It sold both trailer-mounted and permanent model rides to theme parks throughout the world. Models included the Meteor, Paratrooper, Round Up, and Tip Top. In 1968, the company's estimated business brought in over $1.5 million and its plant space was 25,000 square feet.http://photos.salemhistory.net/cdm/singleitem/collection/sj/id/597 By the early 1970s, Hrubetz was selling 60 rides each year, making it the second largest manufacturer of amusement rides in the United States. They closed their manufacturing doors in 1992. History The company was founded by Frank Hrubetz, a 1930 graduate of Oregon State College with a degree in mechanical engineering. Hrubetz worked for the Eyerly Aircraft Company which developed a 10-foot airplane on a fixed base for training pilots. Called the Orientator, it used a small electric propeller and could climb, dive and turn. The company discovered it was more profitable as entertainment after one buyer placed the trainer on the corner of Hollywood and Vine in Los Angeles as an amusement ride. While working for Lee Eyerly, Hrubetz helped develop other rides including the Loop-O-Plane and later Roll-O-Plane‚Äîtwo small bullet- shaped cars that spun rapidly on a vertical axis. In 1939, Hrubetz left Eyerly to become a competitive manufacturer with Frank Hrubetz & Co.

Life  He was the second son of Philipp II (born: 17 August 1501; died: 28 March 1529) and his wife, Countess Juliana of Stolberg (born: 15 February 1506; died: 18 June 1580). Philipp III's elder brother died young; Philipp III was only three years old when he inherited the county. His mother and relatives petitioned the Reichskammergericht to establish a regency council. The council consisted of: * Countess Juliana of Stolberg, Philipp III's mother * Count William \\"the Rich\\" of Nassau-Dillenburg. He was Philipp's first cousin twice removed (a grandson of Johann IV, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg, Philipp's great-great- grandfather). He married Philipp's mother during the regency. * Count Balthasar of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg, Philipp's uncle (a younger brother of Philipp II). He appears to have done most of the work in the council, however, he died in 1534. * Count Reinhard I of Solms-Hohensolms-Lich, Philipp's first cousin once removed. There was a problem: Philipp II had demanded that his younger brother Balthasar would waive his claims on Hanau-M√ºnzenberg before he could become a regent. A deed to this effect had been prepared, but Philipp II had died before he could seal the deed. It was argued that this deed was not legally valid, because it had not been sealed, and that Balthasar therefore had a claim to rule Hanau-M√ºnzenberg himself and that this potential claim stood in the way of his becoming a regent. This problem was resolved by arguing that Philipp II, by not sealing the deed before his death, had implicitly withdrawn his demand. Philipp III and his younger brother Reinhard of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg studied at the universities of Mainz and Ingolstadt. They then made a Grand Tour to Antwerp, Mechelen, Leuven, Brussels, Breda and Strasbourg and then to Buchsweiler (now: Bouxwiller in France), the \\"capital\\" of Hanau-Lichtenberg, where they visited their relatives. From Buchsweiler, they travelled to France, where they studied at Orl√©ans and Bourges.  Reign  = Reformation = During his reign -- in fact, while the regency council was ruling on his behalf -- the Reformation took hold in the County of Hanau- M√ºnzenberg. Among his regency council, his uncle Balthasar was supporting the reformation, while Count Reinhard I of Solms-Lich-Hohensolms was opposed to it. Initially, the reformation was introduced gradually: when church staff retired, their successor would be a Lutheran. As early as 1523, the pastor Adolf Arborgast was includeded in the chapter of the St. Mary's church. When he was appointed, he explained that he wanted to spend little effort on vespers and the daily mass, but would instead concentrate on his sermons and putting forward the Gospel. The real reformer of Hanau was his successor Philipp Neunheller MA; during his time in office, the new faith gained more and more ground. The Catholic faith was never officially banned. The number of Catholic priests steadily decreased, as they were not replaced when they retired. = Ruling on his own = In 1544, Count Philipp was declared an adult, although he was only 18 years old and the age of consent was 25 under the Jus commune. Apparently, his guardians wanted to liberate themselves from this annoying task, even if they still had to act as guardians for Philipp's younger brother Reinhard. In 1561, Count Philipp III purchased Naumburg Castle, the former Naumburg Abbey in Wetterau, including the Jus patronatus of Bruchk√∂bel, Oberissigheim and Kesselstadt, villages within the county of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg. During his reign, the renovation of Hanau City Castle and the construction of Fortress Hanau were completed. He also paid the imperial tax for the Turkish War. = Inheriting Rieneck = { style = \\"float: right; background: transparent; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\\" - valign = \\"top\\"  Coat of arms of Rieneck, after Scheibler's armorial 1450‚Äì1480  Coat of arms of the Lords and Counts of Hanau, after Scheibler's armorial } Count Philipp III of Rieneck co-operated closely with Count Philipp III of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg on the issue of the Reformation and on other issue. As it was foreseeable that the Count of Rienieck would die without a male heir, he asked Emperor Karl V for permission to bequeath Rieneck to Hanau. Permission was granted in 1555. One argument used for this permission was the similarity between the coats of arms of Rieneck and Hanau, which suggested that they had from a common ancestor, which was actually not the case. Since Emperor Karl V abdicated in the same year, Count Philipp III of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg attempted to ask his successor Emperor Ferdinand I to confirm the permission at the Diet of Augsburg of 1558. He had, however, forgotten to bring the charter sealed by Karl, to that Ferdinand could not confirm it. Philipp III of Rieneck died on 3 September 1559, before this error could be corrected. His territory fell back to the Archbishopric of Mainz and the Bishopric of W√ºrzburg.Theodor Ruf: Hanau und Rieneck. √úber das wechselhafte Verh√§ltnis zweier benachbarter Adelsgeschlechter im Mittelalter, in: Neues Magazin f√ºr Hanauische Geschichte, vol. 8, issue 6, p. 300-311 (308) Philipp III of Hanau could only inherit the coat of arms and the title of \\"Count of Rieneck\\".  Death  Epitaph of Count Philipp III of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg and his wife, Countess Palatine Helene of Simmern, in the St. Mary's Church in Hanau Count Philipp III died on 14 November 1561 after six years of illness and was buried before the high altar of the St. Mary's Church in Hanau on the right side. Two Renaissance epitaphs, for Philipp and his wife, were created by Johann von Trarbach and mounted on the southern wall of the choir. These epitaphs were preserved until this day. The Counts of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg usually died between the ages of 20 and 40, leaving an underage son as their successor. Presumably, they suffered from some hereditary disease - which disease is unknown. Nine successive counts died of a disease before the age of 40; this is unlikely to be a coincidence.  Marriage and issue  Coats of arms of Count Philipp III and countess palatine Helena in the St. Mary's Church in Hanau with severe environmental damage On 22 November 1551 Count Philipp III married Countess Palatine Helena of Simmern. They had five children: # Philipp Ludwig I (21 November 1553 - 4 February 1580). # Dorothea (4 February 1556 - September 1638), married firstly Count Anton of Oldenburg and secondly Count Volrad of Gleichen-Kranichfeld- Ehrenstein-Blankenhain. # Reinhard Wilhelm (28 September 1557 - 17 February 1558);After his funeral, a funeral sermon for him appeared in Hanau: Hessian State Archive Marburg, file 81, Hanau Government, A 28,3(2) he was buried in the choir of the St. Mary's Church in Hanau. # Johann Philipp (6 November 1559 - 22 April 1560), also buried in the choir of St. Mary's Church in Hanau # Maria (20 January 1562 - 15 February 1605), born posthumously, died unmarried. The coats of arms of Count Philipp III and Countess Palatine Helena of Simmern can be seen at the main entrance to St. Mary's Church in Hanau -- unfortunately, due to environmental weathering, they are in a poor condition.

Owing much to the Royal Crescent in Bath, but described by the Royal Institution of British Architects as \\"more richly decorated and altogether more complex\\", it was designed by the architect John Carr, and built for the Fifth Duke of Devonshire between 1780 and 1789. Location Buxton Crescent with the Pump Room to the left The Old Hall Hotel at the south-west end of the attached range of listed buildings The Buxton Thermal Baths, at the other end of range, with The Colonnade at far right, and the side of the Crescent visible upper left St Ann's Well The Crescent faces the site of St Ann's Well, where warm spring water has flowed for thousands of years. The well is at the foot of The Slopes, a steep landscaped hillside in the centre of Buxton. Here the geological strata channel mineral water from a mile below ground, to emerge at a constant . Current setting Originally detached, the Crescent building is now the centrepiece of an attached range facing The Slopes. * To the left (southwest) are the Natural Mineral Baths (Grade II listed, built 1851‚Äì53 by Henry Currey), recently the tourist office but now empty; followed by the Old Hall Hotel (1572, altered 1672, rebuilt 1725‚Äì35, listed Grade II*). * To the right (northeast) are the Buxton Thermal Baths, now shops; and The Colonnade, a row of shops with a projecting canopy (both Grade II listed, 1851‚Äì53, also by Currey). * Across the forecourt of the Crescent, at the foot of The Slopes, are the Pump Room (1894, also by Currey); and the adjacent public drinking spout St Ann's Well, built c.1940, on the site of earlier wells dating back to the Roman period. Original construction and use The Crescent was built for William Cavendish, the 5th Duke of Devonshire, as part of his scheme to establish Buxton as a fashionable Georgian spa town. The facade forms an arc of a circle facing southeast. It was built as a unified structure incorporating a hotel, five lodging houses, and a grand assembly room with a fine painted ceiling. The Assembly Rooms became the social heart of 18th-century Buxton. On the ground floor arcade were shops (including a hair and wig-dresser) and kitchens were in the basement. Subsequent history Over time, St. Ann's Hotel at the western end of the Crescent, and the Great Hotel, incorporating the Assembly Rooms at the eastern end, took over the intervening lodging houses in the centre of the building. =Twentieth century= The western end served as a hotel. The eastern end served as council offices, a library and a clinic. The hotel at the western end closed in the mid-1980s due to the high cost of necessary repairs. The whole building was closed when major structural problems were discovered in the assembly rooms, and by 1992 lay empty. The hotel part was bought by the local council in 1993, at which time the whole building fell into public ownership. Restoration and re-opening In 1993 with a grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund the High Peak Borough Council purchased the Crescent to act as a temporary caretaker of the building until a suitable buyer could be found. A further ¬£1.5 million from English Heritage was used to make the building weathertight. The Crescent, Pump Rooms and Natural Baths buildings were then jointly marketed by the borough and county councils. In 1994 the Monumental Trust proposed a scheme to convert the Crescent into flats; however, no funding was found. In December 2000 the combined councils applied to the Heritage Lottery Fund to help finance plans to restore the Crescent as a hotel and to build new spa facilities. Funding was approved in July 2003. Work to restore, redevelop and manage the hotel and spa was put out to tender, which was won in December 2003 by a partnership of the Trevor Osborne Property Group Limited and CP Holdings Limited, the parent company of the spa hotel specialists Danubius hotels. The then ¬£23 million plan was scheduled for completion in 2007. However the project suffered a series of delays, including funding and technical and legal issues relating to the continued supply of water from springs beneath the buildings to Nestl√©, the bottler of Buxton Water, and it was not until April 2012 that an agreement between the joint councils and the developer to start the first phase of the project could be signed. Phase one work on the then ¬£35 million project for a 79-bedroom 5-star hotel, natural baths, a visitor interpretation centre, a thermal mineral water spa and specialist shops commenced in the summer of 2012. Funding problems delayed the main part of project further, but with a loan guarantee from Derbyshire County Council and an additional grant of ¬£11.3 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund announced in 2014, work resumed in 2015. In October 2018, with the project still incomplete, Derbyshire County Council agreed to invest a further ¬£5.7 million, with the total project cost rising to ¬£68.4 million.

Along with Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Fort Wayne, it is the seat of the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend. History =St. Matthew Parish= The Rev. John DeGroote bought 14 lots in the Oak Park addition of South Bend in 1921. Initial plans called for a building to house a combined church and school, but because the estimated cost of $35,000 was considered too expensive, Bishop Herman Alerding suggested a more modest wooden structure to serve temporarily as a church. The Rev. Theodore Hammes was appointed as the parish's first pastor and initially lived at St. Monica's parish in Mishawaka. Twenty-two men volunteered to help build the church, which was constructed in May 1922 for $10,000. The sanctuary was dedicated August 13, 1922, with a parish hall in the basement. The congregation quickly outgrew the structure's capacity of 240, and in October 1923, church leaders dedicated an expansion that increased the seating capacity to 600. The parish purchased six additional lots in 1924 which became the site of a school in 1929. The Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of Victory arrived at St. Matthew in 1942 and stayed until 1958. They taught religious education to the children who did not attend the parish school and performed other duties. The current rectory opened in 1954 to replace a small house that was no longer adequate and soon after, in 1959, ground was broken for the current church. The old church was demolished however, the bells were stored to become part of the new church. =St. Matthew Cathedral= In 1960, Pope John XXIII changed the name of the Diocese of Fort Wayne to the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend. St. Matthew Church, which was still under construction, was named Co-cathedral for the diocese. Msgr. Joseph R. Crowley became pastor of St. Matthew in 1969 and on August 24, 1971, was named auxiliary bishop for the diocese. After his ordination as bishop, he assumed the post of diocesan director of religious education, but two years later, returned to St. Matthew as pastor. He was to be the first of three auxiliary bishops to serve the parish consecutively as its pastor. In 1989, the parish choir, under the direction of Dr. Edward Kline, was invited to sing at the Vatican. In 1992, the campus grew again with the opening of the Cathedral Center and a day care center in the former convent. The day care center expanded into another building that the parish purchased in 1994. Bishop Daniel R. Jenky, C.S.C., who became pastor in 1997, left the parish in 2002 to become Bishop of Peoria. Catholic schools Construction of St. Matthew School began May 15, 1929 and Bishop John F. Noll dedicated the structure, which cost $167,000, on October 13, 1929. Enrollment the first year was 150 students in five grades taught by the Sisters of St. Joseph. The school expanded one grade each year until 1932. In 1934, the Brothers of the Holy Cross opened Central Catholic High School with 18 students on the second floor of the school building. As the enrollment increased, the brothers added additional classrooms and athletic programs. Tuition in the early years was $40. The number of brothers on the faculty increased which also grew to include a lay person, who taught biology and coach the athletic teams. Professors from the University of Notre Dame also taught at the school. The schools largest enrollment was 237 boys, however it was unable to withstand changes in the neighborhood and closed in 1951 when three Catholic schools merged to create St. Joseph High School. After Central Catholic left St. Matthew School expanded into the space. The parish added a new gymnasium in 1955 and significantly renovated the older building during the pastorate of Bishop Jenky.

Hug, nicknamed 'The Silver Bullet', has competed in four Summer Paralympic Games for Switzerland, winning two bronze medals in his first Games in Athens in 2004. In 2010 he set four world records in four days, and at the 2011 World Championships he won a gold in the 10,000 metres and four silver medals, losing the gold in three events to long term rival David Weir. This rivalry continued into the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, where Hug won two silvers, in the 800m and the marathon. In the 2013 World Championships Hug dominated the field, winning five golds and a silver. During the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, Hug was one of the most consistent competitors in the T54 class, winning two golds, in the 800 m and marathon, and two silvers medals, in the 1500m and 500m. As well as numerous World and European track medals, Hug is also a world class marathon athlete, winning the men's elite wheelchair event at the Berlin, (2011, 2012), New York City (2013, 2016, 2017), London (2014, 2016), Chicago (2016), and Boston Marathons (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018). Career history =Early career= Hug was born in the municipality of Pfyn in Switzerland in 1986. Born with spina bifida, Hug grew up on a farm, the youngest of four brothers. As a young child, he met Swiss wheelchair racer, and Hug's sporting idol, Franz Nietlispach, beginning Hug's desire to take up athletics. The ten-year-old Hug was introduced to racing when a sports teacher brought in an old racing wheelchair. This led to Hug competing in his first wheelchair race that year, the 3 km youth race which was part of the Schenkon Marathon. Winning this event inspired him to take up wheelchair athletics and he joined the Swiss Paraplegic Centre in Nottwil where he teamed up with trainer Paul Odermatt. The following years saw Hug develop from a junior athlete into an elite racer and he began competing in both Switzerland and abroad. In 2001 he made the athletics team for Wheelchair Sport Switzerland (Rollstuhlsport Schweiz), and the same year he was accepted into the sports school at Kreuzlingen. Hug described the fact that he was the only wheelchair athlete at the school as being \\"immensely important for my personal development.\\" In 2002 Hug accepted a place at the Schule fur Beruf und Weiterbildung (School for Employment and Further Education) in Romanshorn, believing that an education outside sport would be vital in his later life. =Elite career= Hug competed in his first world class international when he was selected to represent Switzerland at the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens despite not being part of the national team setup. He took part in both men's wheelchair relay races the 4 √ó 100m T53‚ÄìT54 and 4 √ó 400m T53‚ÄìT54, although Switzerland failed to progress through to the finals in either events. As an individual he competed in four races, reaching the finals in each. He failed to medal in the 400m and 5000m but finishing third in both the 800m (1:32.66) and 1500m (3:05.48) where he won his two bronze medals. On returning from the Games he was named Newcomer of the Year 2004 by Credit Suisse Sports Award and the following year he graduated to the Swiss national team. In 2006 Hug competed for Switzerland at the IPC Athletics World Championships in Assen in the Netherlands. There he took his first major international gold medal when he won the men's 10,000m in the T54 (23:06.71). He collected a further three medals at the games, silvers in the 400m (48.97), 800m (1:39.10) and 5,000m (11:20.68). In the 400m he lost the gold to British racer David Weir, beginning a rivalry between the two athletes that would define many of their races on the track and in marathons over the following years. In 2008 Hug travelled to Beijing with the Swiss team to compete in the Summer Paralympics. There he competed in four tracks events: the 400m, 800m, 1,500m and 5,000m; and the marathon. By his own admission the games were a disappointment, as he failed to record a single podium finish, crashing out in both the 1,500m and the marathon. His fortunes changed over the next two years and this was highlighted by his results in the 2010 season. Between the 24 and 27 June 2010 Hug competed at a race meet in Switzerland. There he set new world records in four events in the T54 category: the 800m (1:31.12), 1,500m (2:54.51), 5,000m (9:53.05) and 10,000m (19:50.04). The next major competition for Hug was the 2011 IPC Athletics World Championship held in Christchurch, New Zealand. Despite going into the Championship as the new world champion, David Weir, whose records Hug had broken in 2010, was also hitting form as he eyed the Paralympic finals in his home capital of London in 2012. Hug ambitiously entered all eight events available to him. He was disqualified from his less favoured sprint events, the 100m and 200m, but in the mid distance 400m, he took the silver, finishing second to China's Liu Chengming. In the 800m, 1,500m and 5,000m Hug faced Weir in the finals, and was unable to beat his British rival, taking silver behind Weir in all three events. Hug was still able to leave the Championship with a gold when he took the 10,000m, but failed to complete the marathon. It was during these championships that Hug gained the nickname 'The Silver Bullet', given to him in reference to his trademark silver helmet that he wears when racing. 2011 also saw Hug win his first major city marathon event when he came first in the 2011 Berlin Marathon. Hug, in his trademark silver helmet challenges David Weir at the 2013 London Marathon The 2011 World Championships set the scene for the build- up to the 2012 Summer Paralympics, held in London. Hug entered five events, reaching the finals in all of them. In the 400m he qualified in second place in his heat, but finished fifth in the final. In the 800m he came through his heat in second place to David Weir, and the result was repeated in the final, Hug taking silver to Weir's gold. In both the 1,500m and 5,000m he finished just outside the medals in fourth place. In the marathon, the final race of the Athletics program of the Paralympics, only a second separated Weir in gold, Hug in silver and Australia's Kurt Fearnley in bronze. Hug completed 2012 by retaining his marathon crown in German by winning the 2012 Berlin Marathon. Weir's decision not to compete at the 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships in Lyon, opened up the field. Hug took full opportunity of the situation and dominated the T54 track events. He entered six events winning gold in five of them: 400 metres, 1,500 metres, 5,000 metres, 10,000 metres and Marathon. The only person to best him at the Championship was Kim Gyu-Dae of South Korea who pushed Hug into silver medal position in the 800 metres. In November 2013 Hug entered his fourth New York Marathon, and in a close race edged out South Africa's Ernst Van Dyk to take the title. On 13 April 2014, a week after winning the Paris Marathon, Hug entered the London Marathon, beating his long-time rival Weir into second place to take the men's wheelchair title. This was Hug's first London Marathon win after finishing second in 2010, 2012 and 2013. After finishing fourth in the last two attempts, on 20 April 2015 Hug finished first in the Boston Marathon, beating ten-times winner Ernst Van Dyk into second place by over six minutes. Later that year Hug competed in the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships in Doha, with commentators believing the major medals would be contested between Hug and Weir. Instead the longer events were dominated by Thailand's Rawat Tana, who took gold in both the 1500m and 5000m. Hug finished fifth in the 1500m but managed to win a silver in the 5000m. Hug also entered the 800m, where he finished third to collect his second medal of the games. In 2016 Hug won two elite city marathon events in the space of a week. On 18 April Hug won his second Boston Marathon with a time of 1:24.01, and followed this six days later with his second London Marathon victory. Marcel Hug near halfway point of the Boston Marathon in 2018. In 2016 Hug qualified for his fourth consecutive Paralympics, travelling to Rio de Janeiro where he took part in four events at the 2016 Summer Paralympics. He won medals in all four events, two silvers in the 1500m and 5000m races and his first Paralympic gold medals, one in the 800m and then on the last day he also won the men's T54 marathon. After Rio, Hug continued to compete on the World Marathon circuit, and in October he won his first Chicago Marathon, beating Kurt Fearnley in a photo finish. In November, in a repeat of a photo finish against Kurt Fearnley, he won his second New York City Marathon.

He was described by Wisden Cricketer's Almanack as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket. In 1952, he became the first professional cricketer to be appointed captain of England in a Test match at home, and the first anywhere in the 20th Century. Up until then, England captains were all amateurs; professionals were considered to be unsuitable captains because of their perceived social status and alleged difficulties for one professional to lead another. Hutton won his first series against India and then led England against Australia in the Ashes, which England had not held since 1934. Amid great interest from the public, England won the series in the final match. Hutton then led England in a controversial tour of the West Indies, where local politics and the behaviour of players led to difficulties. Although the series was drawn and Hutton had great personal success, he faced criticism for the behaviour of his team. When he withdrew from cricket for a time in 1954, he was replaced as captain and influential members of the cricket establishment wanted to replace him as captain for the forthcoming tour of Australia. However, he retained the position and led England to a 3-1 victory that winter, after which he retired owing to ill health and mental exhaustion. Background From the late nineteenth century, most captains were amateurs. Amateurs were usually from privileged backgrounds, while professionals were mainly from the working classes. Class distinctions pervaded cricket, which was organised and administered by former and current amateurs. They wished to preserve leadership roles for members of the Establishment, in defiance of broader social changes which had reduced their influence in other sports.Birley, pp. 105-6.Ryder, pp. 175, 179.Williams, p. 187. Administrators reasoned that amateurs were better captains as they were free from worries over employment. The Wisden editor believed that \\"the professional may have difficulty in enforcing discipline. He would naturally hesitate to suggest to his committee that this player or that should be dropped, and so be instrumental in depriving the man in question of some part of his livelihood. Further, feeling that an error of judgment would prejudice his standing with the committee, he might well hesitate to take risks.\\" In 1925, Lord Hawke, then the Yorkshire president, expressing his hope that an amateur would always be available to captain the national side, had made the impromptu comment, \\"Pray God, no professional shall ever captain England.\\"Gibson, p. 154. However, in the 1950s, it became difficult to find suitable choices as captain, and the press began to debate the merits of a professional taking the role. When Freddie Brown was a surprise choice as England captain in 1950, the professional Denis Compton was appointed as the vice-captain.Gibson, pp. 179‚Äì81.Howat, pp. 91‚Äì92. However, as the tour progressed the press noticed that Brown consulted Hutton more frequently than Compton.Gibson, p. 182. Appointment When Freddie Brown resigned from the captaincy of England at the end of 1951, the selectors were left with a difficult decision. England captains in all home Test matches, and in all 20th-century Tests, had been amateurs. In 1952, none of the amateur county captains were considered to be of a high enough standard to represent England in a Test, or were considered experienced enough to be captain. Norman Yardley was a possibility, as was Denis Compton.Gibson, p. 184. To solve the problem, the selectors chose Hutton, who became the first professional cricketer in the 20th century to captain England in a Test match. The press had anticipated the appointment, and Hutton had expressed a willingness to accept the captaincy, although he was unwilling to become an amateur, as Hammond had done before him.Howat, pp. 105-06. The editor of Wisden expressed his approval, writing: \\"In breaking with tradition and choosing a professional as captain the Selection Committee made a vital decision in the interests of England, because it should mean that in future no man will be picked as leader unless he is worth a place in the side.\\" E. W. Swanton and the Yorkshire Post also approved of Hutton's appointment.Howat, p. 106. The Times congratulated the selectors on their boldness, acknowledging that the step of a professional appointment would have been inevitable in the near future but could have been postponed. It also noted precedents such as the appointment of Hammond as captain, and expressed the hope that Hutton's batting would not be affected. Hutton publicly stated his delight, but was privately concerned about how the cricket establishment and M.C.C. members would receive him.Howat, pp. 106-07. Hutton's first series as captain was against India, although England were far too strong for the tourists in this series. Hutton was only named as captain for the first Test, rather than the whole series, to the surprise of many commentators.Howat, p. 107. The Wisden editor approved of his performance as captain, particularly in the improvement in the English fielding. The only reservation was over Hutton's cautious approach. His first Test was before his home crowd of Headingley, and the Wisden correspondent wrote: \\"For Hutton the match was a personal triumph. Tradition had been broken with his appointment as a professional captain of England and he must have known that the eyes of the world were upon him. He did not falter and his astute leadership earned him many admirers and, perhaps, guided future policy.\\" England won by seven wickets, with Fred Trueman reducing India to none for four wickets on his debut. Hutton himself only scored ten runs in each innings. Hutton was more successful with the bat in the second Test, scoring 150 out of a total of 537, although he made a very slow start and possibly caused the other players to bat slowly. However, Wisden believed that England owed much to Hutton's tactics in the match in forcing a win, although it criticised his caution in letting the match go into a fifth day through slow batting in England's second innings. Following this match, the selectors appointed Hutton captain for the rest of the series. In the final two Tests, Hutton scored 104 and 86 and his bowlers dominated the Indian batsmen; the final Test was ruined by weather, but England won the four match series 3-0.Howat, p. 108. In the series, Hutton scored 399 runs at an average of 79.80. Ashes victory At the start of the 1953 season, England entered the summer facing a Test series against Australia, who had held the Ashes since 1934, captained by Lindsay Hassett. Critics considered that England had a good chance of regaining the Ashes following their form in 1952, but Australia remained confident, particularly after winning six of their first eight games by an innings (including a victory over Yorkshire).Howat, p. 112. Once the Tests began, Hutton began well with scores of 43 and 60 not out in the drawn first Test. He had gone into the match with a cloud over his fitness following a shoulder injury, but top- scored in both innings. However, England's dismissal for just 144 in their first innings made Hutton doubtful about England's prospects for the series; only 14 wickets for Alec Bedser kept England in the match before rain came.Howat, pp. 112-13. Before the second Test, Hutton scored two fifties against the Australians for Yorkshire, but his fitness again came into question before the Test, this time with fibrositis. His movement was restricted while fielding, and he dropped three catches in Australia's first innings, injuring his thumb in the process.Howat, p. 113. Despite these problems, Hutton scored 145 when he batted in England's first innings, reaching 2,000 Test runs against Australia in the process. He added 168 with Tom Graveney, batting with great freedom. Hutton shared another century stand with Compton, surviving a difficult spell with the new ball. Wisden said that the \\"sight of England batsmen giving free rein to their strokes brought undisguised delight to many who had bemoaned the lack of aggression in so much Test cricket. The spectacle was glorious to behold.\\" The second innings was a different story, with Hutton dismissed early chasing a winnings total of 343, and it took a long stand between Willie Watson and Trevor Bailey to allow England to escape with a draw after a batting collapse. At this point in the series, Hutton faced pressure from the press: journalists found fault with his caution, the positions in which he placed fielders and his use of bowlers. However, the selectors were also criticised for continuing to appoint Hutton as captain on a match-by-match basis instead of for the whole series. Hutton believed that they may have been looking unsuccessfully for an alternative captain.Howat, p. 114. Hutton again faced fitness concerns going into the third Test, not declaring himself fit until just before the match. Rain prevented a result; Hutton scored 66, Wisden complementing his strokeplay, and earned praise for securing a psychological advantage in pressuring Australia on a turning pitch in their second innings, even though a result was out of the question. Finding the English spinners very difficult to play, Australia collapsed to 35 for eight before time ran out. After the match, the Australians came under pressure from press who began to search for reasons for the team's perceived poor performances. In contrast, Hutton was appointed captain for the rest of the series, as well as for the forthcoming M.C.C. winter tour of West Indies.Howat, p. 115. The fourth Test, in front of Hutton's home crowd, was Hutton's least successful of the series. Having been put into bat by Hassett, the first time an Australian captain had fielded first against England since 1909, Hutton was bowled second ball by a Yorker from Lindwall. England never recovered, batting very slowly to score 167 and after the first innings, Australia led by 99 with three days left. Hutton scored only 25 in the second innings but England batted for a long time, assisted by rain, leaving Australia 177 in 115 minutes to win the game. The tourists were winning easily when Hutton asked Bailey to use the negative tactic of leg theory, bowling wide of leg stump to make it hard to score runs, while using a long run-up to waste time. Only twelve overs were bowled in the last 45 minutes, then considered slow, Australia lost a wicket and the tactics resulted in Australia being 30 short of their target when the game ended. Wisden noted that only a defensive policy had prevented England losing. Hutton was criticised for negativity by the Australian press, but Bill Bowes wrote that the gravity of the situation justified Hutton's tactics.Howat, p. 117. With the press noting parallels between the current series and England's win at the Oval in 1926, the deciding Test began amid great interest from the public. Hutton lost his fifth successive toss in the series but England had their most balanced attack of the series with the recall of Trueman, whom Hutton used in short bursts to take four wickets in Australia's first innings of 275. Surviving an early scare when a bouncer from Lindwall nearly knocked his cap onto his wickets, Hutton scored 82, but England only managed a narrow first innings lead. In their reply, Australia collapsed before the England spinners, for which Wisden gave the credit to Hutton, both for realising that the pitch favoured spin and barely using his pace bowlers, and for some of his tactical decisions in the innings. Although Hutton was run out early in England's pursuit of 132 to win the Ashes, the remaining batsmen took England to their first series win against Australia since 1932-33 and their first home series win since 1926. Hutton was widely acclaimed after the series, particularly for the good spirit which he and Hassett maintained.Howat, p. 121. Norman Preston wrote in Wisden, \\"To my mind not sufficient credit was given to Hutton last summer for his part in lifting England out of the long period of depression ... [He] led his men conscientiously against Australia and, in addition, he shouldered the main responsibility of the batting. He scored nearly 100 runs more than any other player on either side ... His 145 [at Lord's] was easily the finest innings of the whole series. Moreover, Hutton then showed the enterprise we expected...\\" In the series, he scored 443 runs at an average of 55.37. Hutton ended the summer with another century against the Australians at the Scarborough Festival. However, he had felt the strain of leading England that summer, with some at Yorkshire feeling that he relaxed too much to improve discipline at the county, despite his batting successes.Howat, pp. 120-21. Captain in the West Indies In the following winter of 1953-54, Hutton led M.C.C. on a controversial tour of West Indies, becoming the first professional captain of England on a tour in the twentieth century.Howat, p. 126. His appointment as captain had been queried at home by those who believed that a professional might captain at home but would be unsuitable to lead a tour. Hutton also encountered problems as the touring party was being selected. Usually, M.C.C. tours had experienced managers; Hutton had expressed a preference for Billy Griffith, the assistant secretary to the M.C.C. who had toured West Indies as a player in 1947-48\\\\. The M.C.C. decided that Griffith could not be spared from his duties. Instead, they appointed Charles Palmer, the captain of Leicestershire, as a player-manager, despite his inexperience in the role as manager and player--he had not played Test cricket at the time. This appointment caused authority on the tour to become muddled as Palmer was tour manager for most of the time, with authority over the captain, but a player for the rest of the time, under the captain's orders. Nor did Palmer have the experience nor temperament for such a difficult position, according to Alan Gibson, while E. W. Swanton described the appointment of Palmer by the M.C.C. as one of the worst it ever made.Gibson, pp. 185-86.Howat, pp. 140-41.Swanton, p. 148. Hutton also struggled to lead some of the senior professionals on the tour, feeling uncomfortable giving orders to fellow professionals, particularly as some, such as Godfrey Evans, were unco-operative at first,Gibson, p. 186. and he found Trueman difficult to handle.Howat, p. 140. Off field events often overshadowed the cricket. The tour took place while the major territories in the region had growing movements for independence from Britain, which clashed with the British government's plans to establish a West Indies Federation. The resulting friction affected the tour. Before setting off, the cricketers were briefed about the political situation in the West Indies and Hutton believed that the team was being used as a political instrument to support colonial rule.Howat, pp. 125-26. In cricketing terms, the series was being viewed by some journalists as deciding the world champions of cricket, which Wisden's correspondent viewed as increasing the tension before the tour began, as did \\"the constant emphasis upon victory which the M.C.C. players found to be stressed by English residents in the West Indies.\\" The tourists believed that standards among the umpires were low, particularly when pressure from the home crowds, including the threat of violence, made them reluctant to give decisions against the West Indian players. Hutton protested about the appointment of two particular umpires, but the West Indies board insisted that each match had to be umpired by men from the island on which it was held. In several matches, the crowds made noisy protests against events on the field, usually related to umpiring decisions, but also against the West Indian captain Jeff Stollmeyer. During the first Test, the family of an umpire were attacked after he gave out John Holt six runs short of a hundred. The climax came in the third Test where, following the umpire's ruling of Cliff McWatt as run out, bottles and other missiles were thrown onto the outfield. Hutton managed to keep his side and the umpires on the field, possibly defusing a dangerous situation.Gibson, p. 185.Howat, p. 131. There were other diplomatic incidents involving England players. In Barbados, some of the team were alleged to have shown a lack of courtesy to a group of women, but were publicly backed by Hutton and Palmer. In Jamaica, Hutton was accused of insulting the Chief Minister, whom Hutton had not stopped to speak to while coming into the pavilion during a break in his innings. Hutton said that he had not recognised the minister, nor been aware of his attendance at the match, and apologised for any offence caused.Howat, pp. 129, 137-38. Also, some of the reactions of players to events on the field further inflamed feelings, as did the behaviour of some individuals, Trueman in particular. Some critics held Hutton responsible for the perceived lack of sportsmanship by the M.C.C. players, as they felt he should have brought Trueman and other younger tourists under closer control.Howat, pp. 129-30, 140. However, the editor of Wisden later wrote: \\"[Hutton] was involved in the most thankless task any cricket captain has undertaken when he went to West Indies. Instead of finding a friendly cricket atmosphere he and his players were subjected to the impact of deep political and racial feeling--an experience all of them wish to forget. A few members of the team did not hide their innermost feelings, with the result that Hutton came under severe criticism, although his behaviour was blameless.\\" The tour itself began uneventfully, although Hutton was dismissed by his first ball of the tour, in a warm up match against Bermuda. The first-class matches began in Jamaica; the M.C.C. team inflicted only the third defeat on Jamaica by a touring side in the first game (Hutton had played in another when Yorkshire won a match on their 1936 tour) and he second was drawn. As the Test series began, Hutton wanted to exploit what he saw as a West Indian weakness against pace which had been exploited by Australia in 1951-52; he picked four fast bowlers but had misread the pitch, which played very slowly. West Indies were able to build up a big score before England collapsed to the West Indies spinners. Stollmeyer batted again, receiving abuse from the crowd for not enforcing the follow-on, and set a target of 457 to win. Although Hutton believed that the target was achievable on the easy batting pitch, England's batsmen again failed, losing by 140 runs. Both captains employed time-wasting tactics in the match, and used negative leg theory bowling, outside leg stump.Howat, p. 127. Hutton himself scored 24 and 56; in the second Test, he scored 72 and 77 but could not prevent another loss. He had lost his seventh consecutive toss in Tests and despite the loss of early wickets, West Indies scored 383. Wisden criticised Hutton for not placing fielders on the boundary to cut off runs. In reply, England batted very slowly, batting nearly 160 overs for a score of 181; Wisden believed that Hutton was weighed down by responsibility, batting for four and a half hours before being caught from a desperate attacking shot, possibly affected by barracking from the crowd. West Indies batted again and set a target of 495. England were bowled out for 313 to lose by 181 runs. The third Test was won by England by nine wickets, their first victory in the Caribbean since 1935. Hutton, who won the toss for the first time in eight matches, scored 169 in seven hours through concentrating on defence and England's bowlers were able to bowl out West Indies twice. The British press praised Hutton's batting and handling of the tension during the match and the M.C.C. secretary sent a telegram of congratulations to Hutton for his contributions. As the fourth Test was drawn in very easy batting conditions, England had to win the final Test to draw the series. Hutton lost the toss but Trevor Bailey produced his best bowling figures in Tests to bowl out West Indies cheaply in good batting conditions. Hutton then batted for almost nine hours to score 205, his nineteenth and final Test century, increasing his scoring rate after a cautious beginning by the whole team. Previously, no England captain had scored a double century while on tour. Wisden observed that \\"For concentration and control, Hutton's innings ... scarcely could have been excelled.\\" England's bowlers again bowled out West Indies and England scored the required runs to record a series-levelling nine-wicket victory, West Indies' first defeat in Jamaica in a Test. Wisden's verdict on Hutton's series was that he showed mastery of every bowler and stood apart from everyone else. He also displayed some excellent attacking shots. The correspondent wrote, \\"From first to last no batsman compared with Hutton ... Considering the weight of his many responsibilities and worries, Hutton played magnificent cricket...\\" Many England players later praised Hutton's captaincy and performances on the tour,Howat, p. 139. while the press were generally supportive with a few reservations about his caution.Howat, pp. 142-44. Swanton later wrote that England's recovery to level the series was due to Hutton, who \\"[drained] himself to the furthest point of nervous and physical exhaustion ... If it was not a happy tour, much was redeemed by its ending.\\" In five Tests, he scored 677 runs, his highest in a series, at an average of 96.71, the highest on either side. Alan Gibson describes the tour as \\"the bravest effort of his career\\", crediting him for England's recovery from two games down to level the series.Gibson, pp. 184-85. Captaincy manoeuvres Writing in Wisden, Norman Preston claimed that reservations about Hutton's captaincy led to \\"behind the scenes moves to deprive Hutton of his highest ambition--captaincy of M.C.C. in Australia.\\" Hutton's appearances were limited in the 1954 season, missing several matches in the early part of the summer due to neuritis caused by the winter tour. He played in the drawn first Test, Pakistan's inaugural match, but scored a duck in his only innings. Suffering from mental exhaustion and physically unwell, Hutton subsequently missed a month of cricket on medical advice and the selectors appointed the amateur David Sheppard as England captain in his place.Howat, pp. 146-48. Speculation grew in the press that Hutton would surrender the captaincy and that Sheppard, a theology student at the time, was the favoured candidate of the selectors. Sheppard's main supporters were Walter Robins, a selector, and Errol Holmes, a former skipper of Surrey. They pressured Sheppard into putting his name forward to the M.C.C. secretary Ronnie Aird, while the press wanted to know his intentions. He indicated that he could take a leave of absence from his studies if necessary.Gibson, pp. 186-87. Meanwhile, Hutton told the M.C.C. that he would go to Australia as captain or player if required. Sheppard captained England in the second and third Tests against Pakistan, winning both matches without particularly distinguishing himself.Howat, p. 148. The press supported Hutton, running stories about the prejudice against professionals among the M.C.C., but neither Hutton nor Sheppard publicly expressed an opinion. Robins, seeing the strength of opinion on the matter, backed down. As Hutton returned to cricket in July, scoring two centuries, he was appointed captain of the M.C.C. for the winter tour. Wisden claimed in 1955 that the selectors only chose Hutton by a margin of one vote. This was retracted the following year, when it reported the M.C.C. had informed them the vote was unanimous. Returning to captain a slightly weakened England side for the fourth and final Test, Hutton failed with the bat, as Pakistan recorded their first Test victory. In his three Test innings of the season, Hutton scored just 19 runs. Captain in Australia Expectations before the tour were not high following the confusion over captaincy and England's performances against Pakistan. In addition, the selectors, of whom Hutton was one following his appointment, made some controversial choices, omitting Trueman, Jim Laker and Tony Lock who had been part of the winning England team in 1953, while including Colin Cowdrey, who had not been in good form in 1954, and Vic Wilson as cover to Compton, whose fitness was in question. Hutton had emphasised the need to include pace bowlers for the tour.Howat, pp. 148-50.Gibson, p. 187. Unlike the West Indies tour, the M.C.C. party sailed to Australia.Howat, p. 150. The tourists had some success in their first tour games, winning three matches and drawing two. Hutton played in every other game, resting in between, but made scores of 37, 98, 102 and 87; the latter two innings saved the game against New South Wales.Howat, p. 152. Hutton went into the first Test with no spinner. At the start of the match, he won the toss and chose to bowl. It was he first time an England captain had done so in Australia, but the fifth time the team had done so on tour. The tourists suffered early misfortune, with regular wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans ill and Denis Compton breaking his hand while fielding in Australia's innings. Critics regarded the decision as a mistake at the time and have done so ever since, but Wisden's correspondent believed it may have been successful had England not suffered their bad luck and also dropped around twelve catches.Howat, p. 153. Despite defensive bowling, Australia scored 601 for eight declared before England were bowled out 190 and 257 to lose by an innings; Hutton's scores were 4 and 15. Despite the result, Hutton increasingly saw potential in Tyson's bowling, arranging for Alf Gover, in Australia as a journalist but usually a respected coach, to improve and shorten Tyson's run to the wicket.Howat, p. 154. The tourists began the second Test with their confidence shaken. Hutton opted for a more balanced bowling attack; to include the spinners Bob Appleyard and Johnny Wardle, he left out Alec Bedser, England's most reliable bowler since the war, doubting that he was fit enough to play.Howat, p. 155. Australia were also weakened by injuries for this Test, but his did not seem to matter when Hutton lost the toss, had to bat first and England collapsed to 154 in their first innings. Hutton batted over two hours for 30 in this innings and scored 28 in the second. However, in a low scoring match, Tyson proved to be the crucial factor and he bowled England to a 38 run win. After a break for Christmas, Hutton was unwell at the start of the third match in the series, suffering from fibrositis and a heavy cold. After deciding to play at the last minute, he again left out Bedser from the side, although he was fit to play. This was an unexpected decision. Hutton did not inform Bedser that he would not play before the match, and the bowler only learned of his fate when he saw the team list displayed in the dressing room before the match.Howat, pp. 156-57. Hutton scored 12 and 42, with the latter innings particularly valuable at a difficult time in the match. However, Peter May and Colin Cowdrey made large scores and Tyson took seven wickets as Australia were bowled out for 111 in their second innings, giving England a 128 run victory in a match where no innings total reached 300. In the fourth Test, Hutton lost the toss and England bowled first in perfect conditions for batting. He used his bowlers in short spells, frequently rotating them, and they bowled Australia out for 323. In England's reply, Hutton made 80, his only fifty in the series and the highest score of the match, in four and a half hours before he fell to a very good catch. England scored 341. When Australia batted again, his introduction of Appleyard into the attack at a crucial time gave England the upper hand according to Wisden which noted that the move was \\"hailed as a touch of genius. Appleyard took early wickets, and the fast bowlers followed up to bowl Australia out for 111. England needed 94 to win, but lost early wickets to Miller, including Hutton. When Hutton returned to the dressing room, he said that Miller had \\"done us again.\\" Compton, the next man in, replied \\"I haven't been in yet\\", and stayed at the wicket until the match was won by five wickets. Many critics and players viewed this as a sign that Hutton's reserved had slipped in the critical situation, but Alan Gibson believed that it was a deliberate act to get the best out of Compton.Gibson, p. 88. England had retained the Ashes, and went on to draw the final Test in a match ruined by rain. Hutton was out to the fourth ball of the match, but although a win was impossible in the time remaining, he kept the pressure on Australia when England bowled. Australia were forced to follow on for the first time by England since 1938, and Hutton took a wicket with the last ball of the match before time ran out. England won the series 3-1. Hutton's tactical approach in the series was praised by Australian and English commentators; they noted how Hutton observed his opponents very carefully, leading to an ability to spot weaknesses. He gave nothing away in the field. His caution was criticised, but the main problem which journalists found with his leadership was his tactic of slowing down the speed at which overs were bowled: he used delaying measures to keep his fast bowlers fresh and slow the scoring. He also found it difficult to communicate with his team, or to fully explain himself. Australian commentators also detected technical faults in his batting.Howat, pp. 162-64. Wisden's correspondent wrote that Hutton had four different opening partners in the series; \\"the burden he carried in this respect, added to all the care and attention he gave to the captaincy both on and off the field, severely taxed him both mentally and physically.\\" With the bat, Hutton scored 220 runs in Tests at an average of 24.44. The tour ended with two Tests in New Zealand; England won the first by eight wickets. The tourists won the second by an innings and 20 runs. New Zealand were bowled out for 26 in their second innings, which remains the lowest Test score in August 2010. In the latter match, Hutton scored 53 batting at number five in his final Test innings. Retirement Hutton returned to England by boat; the rest of the team travelled by air. On his arrival, he was made an honorary member of the M.C.C., which changed its rules to allow a current professional to join the club. The selectors appointed him as England captain for the entire forthcoming series against South Africa, on the condition he reduced time wasting by the team. Usually, captains were appointed for one or two matches; the only other captain to be appointed for a whole summer was C. B. Fry in 1912.Howat, pp. 166-67. However, Hutton's form was uncertain at the start of the 1955 season. He captained M.C.C. against the tourists, but had to withdraw from the final day of the match with lumbago. With his health uncertain, he resigned from the England captaincy. The selectors made Peter May captain in his place and appointed Hutton as a selector.Howat, p. 168. Hutton continued to play for Yorkshire until the end of June. Against Nottinghamshire, he scored 194 in five hours. His last 100 runs came in an hour, a very fast rate of scoring, but this was his final first-class century. After the following match, his back became too painful to continue and he did not play again that season.Howat, p. 169. That June, he was knighted for services to cricket. Following the advice of a specialist, Hutton announced his retirement from first-class cricket in January 1956. At 39, he was considered at the time to be young to retire.

The steam was then transmitted to a separate engine room, often (but not always) located immediately aft, where it was utilized to power the vessel. To increase the safety and damage survivability of a vessel, the machinery necessary for operations may be segregated into various spaces, the fire room was one of these spaces, and was among the largest physical compartment of the machinery space. On some ships, the space comprised more than one fire room, such as forward and aft, or port or starboard fire rooms, or may be simply numbered. Each room was connected to a flue, exhausting into a stack ventilating smoke. By their nature, fire rooms were less complex than their allied engine room and were normally supervised by less senior personnel. On a large percentage of vessels, ships and boats, the fire room was located near the bottom, and at the rear, or aft, end of the vessel, and usually comprised few compartments. This design maximized the cargo carrying capacity of the vessel. The fire room on some ships was situated amid-ships, especially on vessels built from the 1880s to the 1990s. Equipment Vessels typically contained several engines for different purposes. Main, or propulsion engines are used to turn the ship's propeller and move the ship through the water. The fire room got its name from the days when ships burned coal to heat steam to drive the steam engines or turbines; the room was where the stokers spent their days shoveling coal continuously onto the grates under the boiler; poor men could sometimes pay for a trip across the Atlantic by signing on to work as a stoker for a one way trip, laboring in exchange for a temporary place on the crew. Later heavy fuel oil came into use, first combined with coal, then alone, as the petroleum industry developed, and the cleaner, easier to transport, load and burn liquid was found to be far superior once the appropriate logistical network was set up. With coal power, there was a mechanism for removing ash from the grates, as they would build up rapidly over time (the lighter fly ash would be drawn up the stack with the smoke). On a steamship, power for both electricity and propulsion is provided by one or more large boilers giving rise to the alternate name boiler room. The latter name was preferred in the British Navy, among others. High pressure steam from the boiler is piped to the engine room to drive reciprocating engines or turbines for propulsion, and turbo generators for electricity. When cruising, it was normal for a naval vessel to damp the fires on up to two- thirds of their boilers, and use the steam from only a few boilers in one or two fire rooms to power the engines at low power. When higher speeds were required, more boilers would be brought on line (they were rarely extinguished entirely, as re-lighting a boiler was time-consuming). In rare occasions, when flank speed was called for, all boilers would be burning at once, generating a great deal of steam for high-speed operation, but at a very inefficient rate of coal consumption. Merchant vessels had much less need for high speed, so they would generally be satisfied with far fewer boilers, and much lower maximum speeds (and even then they would often save on fuel by not using all of the boilers, and traveling at a sedate 4-5 knots). Naval ships typically were able to generate a large volume of smoke by changing the fuel mix. Prior to the heavy use of radar, a smoke screen could be used to mask the movement of ships (although smoke screens produced by smoke generators were also used). Coal in particular produced a large amount of black smoke, depending on the grade of coal; generally, the smallest amount of smoke was the most desirable, as it made the vessel harder to spot on the horizon. Damage control Damage control was enhanced by the separation of the fire and engine rooms. In the event of damage to its associated engine room, steam could be transmitted to another engine room. In turn, an engine room could still operate though its associated fire room had become inoperative. Two engineering advances resulted in the disappearance of the fire room in the early 1990s. The first was the movement by naval shipbuilding to nuclear-powered vessels. If a room containing nuclear material was subjected to damage, it was assumed that the event would likely result in abandonment of the ship regardless of the separation of rooms. The second was the adoption of gas turbines in place of oil-fired boilers for all other navy ships. These powered engines directly and needed no boilers. Safety =Fire precautions= Fire rooms were hot, most often very dirty, and potentially dangerous. The presence of flammable fuel meant that a fire hazard existed in the fire room, which was monitored continuously by the ship's engineering staff and various monitoring systems. =Ventilation= Fire rooms employed some means of providing air for the operation of the flame to ignite the oil and associated ventilation. Only spot ventilation was practical to keep personnel cool. This would require an unrestricted hull opening of the same size as the intake area of the engine itself assuming the hull opening is in the fire room itself. Forced draft fire rooms were used until World War II. These required that personnel enter through an air lock to maintain the pressure. These were abandoned when the forced draft occasionally failed and blowback occurred killing fire room personnel. Commonly, screens were placed over openings reducing airflow by approximately 50% so the opening area was increased appropriately. The requirement for general ventilation and the requirement for sufficient combustion air are quite different. A typical arrangement might be to make the opening large enough to provide intake air plus per Minute (CFM) for additional ventilation. Engines pull sufficient air into the fire room for their own operation. However, additional airflow for ventilation usually requires intake and exhaust blowers. Staffing requirements When fired up, there were personnel assignments specified underway, as well as in port. For example, for an , in normal steaming four boilers were operated. This was sufficient to power the ships at speeds up to . For higher speeds, all eight boilers were lit. Each operating boiler required a minimum of four trained operators on watch: a boiler supervisor (BTOW), a superheater burnerman and saturated burnerman to control the steam temperature and pressure and a checkman, who monitored and controlled the water level in the steam drum. In addition, there was a fireroom messenger and a lower level pumpman on duty whenever the fireroom was steaming.

Life  Hedwig was a daughter of Landgrave William IV of Hesse- Kassel (1532-1592) from his marriage to Sabine (1549-1581), a daughter of Duke Christopher of W√ºrttemberg. She married on 11 September 1597 at Wilhelmsburg Castle in Schmalkalden with Count Ernst of Schaumburg (1569-1622). When Hedwig was engaged in 1593, Hedwig's brother Maurice had made it a condition that Ernst would share the government of Schaumburg with his half-brother Adolph. In 1559, Schaumburg was divided by the Treaty of Minden, and Ernst received Lower Schaumburg, consisting of the districts Sachsenhagen, Hagenburg and Bokeloh. Hedwig and Ernst initially lived at the available castle in Sachsenhagen, and extended it to a palace; Ernst later moved his seat of government to B√ºckeburg. Ernst died in 1627. Hedwig constructed a Princely Mausoleum in the St.-Martini Church in Stadthagen. Their marriage remained childless. Hedwig received the city and district of Stadthagen as her wittum. She possessed a Hessian bond of without interest. She gave her nephew William V an annual pension and later bequeathed her bond and all her dower rights to the county of Schaumburg to his widow, Landgravine Amalie Elisabeth, whom she also appointed executrix of her last will and testament. Hedwig died in 1644 and was buried in the Princely Mausoleum in the St.-Martini Church in Stadthagen, next to her husband. An epitaph above her grave reads: There is no other, holier decision of widowhood, than to pass down to the living that which was entrusted by the last will and to guard it, when it is realized.

It is commonly mistaken for a member of the true ant family, as the female is wingless. The species ranges from Connecticut to Missouri in the north and Florida to Texas in the south. The eastern velvet ant is the largest of the velvet ant species in the eastern United States, attaining an approximate length of 0.75 in (1.9 cm). Adults display aposematic coloration, consisting of black overall coloring with an orange-red pattern on the dorsal surface of the thorax and abdomen. They are covered in dense, velvet-like hair. Description and biology Commonly mistaken for an ant, because of its appearance and its common name, it is a parasitoid wasp species in which the females are wingless, as is true for all females of Mutillidae. It can be recognized by its black and orange-red striped coloring. Females are capable of an extremely painful sting, hence the name \\"cow killer\\". They are quick- moving and often take a defensive posture when threatened. They seek out the brood cells of Eastern cicada killers and other large ground-nesting members of Crabronidae, where they deposit an egg onto a host larva. The egg quickly hatches into a white, legless grub, which consumes the host and goes through several larval stages prior to pupation. Unlike the females, males have dark, translucent wings and do not possess a sting. Males fly low over grass in search of mates. Both sexes make a squeaking noise (stridulation) to warn potential predators (another form of aposematism in females, and automimicry in males). Defense The velvet ant has multiple defensive strategies, but is best known for its extremely painful sting, earning it the nickname of \\"cow killer\\". Its defenses include a thickened exoskeleton, the ability to run fast and evasively, warning coloration, stridulatory warning sounds, a chemical secretion, and venom.

White wrote in a New Yorker feature article of November 11, 1961, \\"In it you will find Thurber‚Äôs faith in the renewal of life, his feeling for the beauty and fragility of life on earth.\\" He also wrote \\"Of all the flowers, real and figurative...the one that will remain fresh and wilt-proof is the little flower...on the last page of that lovely book.\\" The novelist Ellen Glasgow, captivated by the book, wrote to Thurber, \\"I found that I had forgotten your wonderful birds. How is it possible to put so much expression into a single curve?\\" http://www.woosterbook.com/review/lastflower.html Thurber's work \\"began where the other cartoonists left off,\\" claimed the German artist George Grosz. It was rumored that Henri Matisse said, \\"the only good artist in New York is a man named Thurber.\\" http://www.woosterbook.com/review/lastflower.html It was translated into French by Albert Camus and published by Gallimard in 1952. = Other media = Thurber's story was animated as part of the climax of Jack Lemmon's 1972 film The War Between Men and Women, the film takes much from Thurber's life and stories. Lemmon's character - based strongly on Thurber himself - tries to show what creativity means to his stepdaughter using The Last Flower as the example. http://www.IMDB.com The story does have similarities to the protest song \\"Where Have All the Flowers Gone?\\", which offers a similar cycle, even though Thurber's work dates from 1939 and the song was written around 1956 by Pete Seeger; Seeger's song was inspired by a short piece in And Quiet Flows the Don the novel by Mikhail Sholokhov. Bertold Hummel and Klaus Meyer (Op 55a) put together a short ballet in 1975 based on The Last Flower. Their wording for the first scene and pas de deux is as follows: :\\"Once again a dictator comes on the scene with his lackeys. :They demonstrate their brutality and begin the war. :The works of mankind are destroyed. :And no-one wants to live any longer with the exception of a flower. :This flower awakes in the girl and the man a joy in living again.\\"http://www.bertoldhummel.de/english/commentaries/opus_55A.html On Thurber's tombstone at Green Lawn Cemetery in Columbus, Ohio, a version of The Last Flower is etched.http://www.thurberhouse.com/james-thurber.html  Synopsis  After World War XII civilization has collapsed. All the groves and gardens have been destroyed, dogs have run away from their masters, and in all the world there is no trace of love. Suddenly, one day, a young girl comes across something she does not recognize - a flower - the last one in the world.

Life Batchelor was born in St Austell, Cornwall and grew up in Vouvry, a village in Switzerland. He graduated from ETH Zurich with a Masters in Theoretical Physics in 1992 and continued studying in Zurich for a PhD in Mathematics, which he obtained in 1997. In 1998, Batchelor joined United Medical and Dental School, which later became part of King's College London (KCL), to work on the application of mathematical principles to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at Guy's Hospital. He rapidly made an impact by employing concepts from differential geometry to study folding and curvature in the developing human brain.Batchelor PG, Castellano Smith AD, Hill DL, Hawkes DJ, Cox TC, Dean AF. Measures of folding applied to the development of the human fetal brain. IEEE Trans Med Imaging. 2002 Aug;21(8):953‚Äì65. . In 2005 he moved to the Centre for Medical Image Computing at University College London, and was appointed a Senior Lecturer in the Imaging Sciences Division at KCL in 2006. He gained a reputation for an ability to get to the heart of the issue and to draw in knowledge from other areas. A good example of this came during his work on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). In trying to quantify the shapes of fibre tracts seen in DTI, he found measures that focussed on shape, not brain size.Batchelor PG, Atkinson D, Hill DL, Calamante F, Connelly A. Anisotropic noise propagation in diffusion tensor MRI sampling schemes. Magn Reson Med. 2003 Jun;49(6):1143‚Äì51. .Batchelor PG, Calamante F, Tournier JD, Atkinson D, Hill DL, Connelly A. Quantification of the shape of fiber tracts. Magn Reson Med. 2006 Apr;55(4):894‚Äì903. . Furthermore, these measures were inspired from such varied fields as torsion and polymer structure analysis and even the orbits of asteroids. In 2002, the choice of which diffusion gradient directions to acquire in diffusion tensor imaging was the subject of debate in the literature, with various empirical approaches having been proposed. At its core, this was a problem that combined the geometry related to the equal distribution of points on a hemisphere (the diffusion directions) and the diffusion-attenuated signal in MRI. Batchelor showed why direction schemes based on icosahedral shapes are optimal, and provided proof that the noise propagation in these icosahedral direction schemes was closely related to the best that could ever be done by acquiring an infinite number of directions. There was also the issue of how to manipulate the tensor data from DTI. In one of his most highly cited papers,Batchelor PG, Moakher M, Atkinson D, Calamante F, Connelly A. A rigorous framework for diffusion tensor calculus. Magn Reson Med. 2005 Jan;53(1):221‚Äì5. . Batchelor provided a rigorous framework that showed how to measure the geodesic distance between tensors (always maintaining an ellipsoid shape), how to average them, how to perform interpolation and rotation and he devised a metric called the geodesic anisotropy ‚Äì an alternative to the commonly used fractional anisotropy measure. Another key insight came from considering the key problem of how to correct non-rigid liver motion in MRI. Batchelor had the insight that this highly non-linear process could nonetheless be expressed concisely and in a general form using matrices.Batchelor PG, Atkinson D, Irarrazaval P, Hill DL, Hajnal J, Larkman D. Matrix description of general motion correction applied to multishot images. Magn Reson Med. 2005 Nov;54(5):1273‚Äì80. . This has opened the field of non-rigid motion correction in MRI (e.g.Atkinson D, Counsell S, Hajnal JV, Batchelor PG, Hill DL, Larkman DJ. Nonlinear phase correction of navigated multi-coil diffusion images. Magn Reson Med. 2006 Nov;56(5):1135‚Äì9. .). Batchelor was a committed teacher and was always willing to patiently assist his colleagues and students with tutorials in mathematics. He recognised the need for education within the medical imaging academic community and in 2007 he organised a highly successful ‚ÄúMaths for Medical Imaging‚Äù summer school, which has since formed the basis of an ongoing component of the King's College Medical Physics MSc. His scope of research extended further including the visionary aim of producing diffusion tensor reconstructions of the beating heart. He and his group were the first to present 3D fibre images of the in- vivo heart of humans.Toussaint N, Sermesant M, Stoeck CT, Kozerke S, Batchelor PG. In vivo human 3D cardiac fibre architecture: reconstruction using curvilinear interpolation of diffusion tensor images. Med Image Comput Comput Assist Interv. 2010;13(Pt 1):418‚Äì25. . Compressed sensing also attracted his interest more recently. The work on k‚Äìt group sparse methods has significantly pushed the acceleration limits for dynamic MRI of the heart and lung.Usman M, Prieto C, Odille F, Atkinson D, Schaeffter T, Batchelor PG. A.

The Church of the Holy Innocents, bordering the Rue Saint-Denis, is in the background. The place with the Fountain of Innocents, 1850 The Fountain of Innocents Place Joachim-du-Bellay is square near the center of Paris, France, in the 1st arrondissement, near Les Halles and the Pompidou Center. It is named after Joachim du Bellay, a French poet and literary critic (1522‚Äì1560). The place Joachim-du-Bellay was built in 1787 on the location of the previous Holy Innocents' Cemetery, after the cemetery's demolition. The Fountain of Innocents now resides in the center of the square, marking the last still standing remnant of the cemetery.  History of Location  While the history of the location on which place Joachim-du-Bellay resides is long and rich, this history of the square itself is rather simple. The previous structure was that of the Saints Innocents Cemetery, which operated, along with The Church of the Saints Innocents, from the 9th century (Middle Ages) to 1780 AD (during the Ancien R√©gime in France), when it was closed due to overuse. The Saints Innocents Cemetery is notable because it held the first documented mural of Danse Macabre, a style of painting during late-medieval times emphasizing the impact of Death on lives and all ages. This mural was destroyed, however, almost 200 years after its construction, in 1669. At the edge of the cemetery there was a fountain, originally named Fountain of the Nymphs and now known as Fountain of Innocents (or Fontaine des Innocents). This fountain was dismantled in 1787 when the grounds of the church and cemetery were finally torn down and replaced by a stone laid square, place Joachim-du-Bellay. The square was originally a herb and vegetable market and was also known as March√© des Innocents. The Fountain of Innocents was re-assembled soon after the completion of said square and erected in its center, where it now stands. The Fountain of Innocents is the oldest monumental fountain in Paris.

It is an intra-city, interconference matchup between the two NFL teams based in the New York metropolitan area. Since 1984, both clubs have shared a home stadium. Thus, a Giants‚ÄìJets game can be referred to as \\"the shortest road trip in the league\\". It can also be referred to as a \\"sibling rivalry\\" since both teams play at and share the stadium. As the teams play in different conferences, the two teams only meet during the regular season once every four years when all four AFC East clubs play all four NFC East clubs. In addition to annual preseason matchups, the only other way the two teams would meet would be in the Super Bowl, which has never occurred. History The New York Jets previously maintained a very tense rivalry with their in-town counterparts, the New York Giants, a rivalry that has since diminished due to the infrequency with which the teams meet in the regular season. Its origins can be traced back to the formation of the American Football League in 1960, as a rival to the more established NFL. The upstart league decided to directly compete with the NFL's Giants, and granted a charter franchise to Harry Wismer, who proclaimed that New York was ready for another professional football team. Like the AFL and the NFL, their respective teams in New York fought for publicity, attention and fans. Since the two teams play each other so infrequently in the regular season, some, including players on both teams, have questioned whether the Giants and Jets have a real rivalry. =First preseason games= However, the Jets and Giants did not actually play each other until a preseason game at the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut, on August 17, 1969, in the lead up to the AFL‚ÄìNFL merger. The game was viewed as a \\"turf war\\" by both opponents. The Giants, considered a mediocre team at the time, were regarded as underdogs and were under much scrutiny by the media and their fans. The Jets on the other hand were coming off a win in Super Bowl III as the first AFL team to win an AFL-NFL Championship Game. Ultimately, the Jets won 37‚Äì14, resulting in the firing of Giants coach Allie Sherman. The teams have played in the preseason annually since. Though the annual preseason game still served as a mild opportunity for bragging rights, the fervor of the rivalry had begun to fade by 1979. It weakened even further in 1990, when the Jets fired Joe Walton, a former player and coach for the Giants who had other former Giants on his staff. Another reason is that because the Jets and the Giants are in different conferences, they have only met in the regular season 11 times since the 1970 AFL‚ÄìNFL merger. Under the league's current scheduling formula, in use since 2002, the two New York teams only met every four years, and can only meet in the postseason if they both advance to the Super Bowl. The first regular season meeting between the two teams came in the first full post-merger season, 1970, in which the Giants beat the Jets 22-10 at Shea Stadium. =The Jets join the Giants in the same stadium= When the Jets left Shea Stadium and moved to Giants Stadium for the 1984 NFL season, many Jets fans hoped the name would be changed, however the Giants, who had the authority to approve the change, refused. Many Jets refused to refer to the stadium by its official name, instead calling it \\"The Meadowlands\\". The naming of the stadium has played a role in the rivalry, as the Giants overshadowed the Jets. The move meant that both the Giants and Jets did not play within the city of their home market, as they have been located in neighboring New Jersey since 1984. =Critical games= The Jets met the Giants in 1988 during the final game of the regular season. The Jets, with a 7‚Äì7‚Äì1 record, had little to lose as their hopes for playoff contention had vanished. The Giants, however, were contending for a playoff spot and a victory would have secured their spot and their division title. Although the six point favorites, the Giants were unable to overcome the Jets defense which saw the Jets sack quarterback Phil Simms eight times. With the Jets' victory and victories by the Rams and Eagles, the Giants were eliminated from playoff contention and the Jets gained what many considered respect. Over the twenty six years since the Jets were accepted into their NFC counterpart's homefield; Giants Stadium; the unexpected and time-tested partnership of both teams have only gotten stronger in spite of the big sibling rivalry, resulting in both teams now sharing MetLife Stadium, a joint-venture in which the two franchises own a fifty percent share. As part of the naming rights agreement, the preseason matchup between the Giants and Jets has been renamed the \\"MetLife Bowl/Snoopy Bowl\\". On December 6, 2015, Jets and Giants played in MetLife Stadium with Giants as the official home team. Jets entered 6-5 and desperately chasing an AFC wildcard spot while the Giants entered 5-6 and were fighting for the top seed in the NFC East. Giants had won the last five meetings between the clubs, and the last two were critical for the Giants' championship runs. After each teams started with one failed possession the Jets led a 78-yard drive with several strong runs by Chris Ivory and finished with a field goal. A couple of possessions later in the second quarter as both teams were stagnant on offense Dwayne Harris returned a Jets punt for an 80-yard touchdown. Jets next possession Chris Ivory fumbled the ball in the Jets red zone but Giants failed to capitalize and only got a field goal out of the opportunity. Jets had another strong drive that ended with a 25-yard pass touchdown pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick to Bilal Powell. Giants star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. caught a 72-yard touchdown pass on the next Giants drive to take a 17-10 lead. Giants got another field goal before the end of the half and entered the locker room up by 10. Giants led an 11-minute drive in the 3rd-4th quarter. On fourth down 2 on the Jets' 4 yard line the Giants controversially attempted to go for the touchdown rather than take a short field goal and threw an interception. Jets marched down to the Giants' redzone but settled for a field goal. Jets got the ball back again with two minutes and all of their timeouts remaining, and marched efficiently down the field until Fitzpatrick threw a TD to Brandon Marshall to tie the game. The teams squared off in overtime. The Jets got the ball first and continued their stellar offensive play from the fourth quarter and scored a short field goal. The Giants got within field goal range to the Jets 30 yard line on their drive, and Josh Brown missed the 48 yarder, his first missed field goal of the year. The Jets beat the Giants for the first time since 1993. =Super Bowl wins by the Giants in 2007 and 2011= During the victory parade for the Giants, celebrating their win in Super Bowl XLII over the Jets division rivals, the New England Patriots, New Jersey government officials took jabs. State Senate President Richard J. Codey took a jab at the Patriots when he referred to their videotaping scandal at Giants Stadium against the Jets in September. \\"If the Patriots were here today, they could film all they want\\", Codey said. Jets coach Rex Ryan made an effort to fuel the flames of the rivalry. The 2011 season matchup, which both teams needed to win to keep their respective playoff hopes alive, was hyped up by trash talking from both teams including comments by Ryan. Just before their December 24, 2011 meeting, the \\"host\\" Jets covered up the \\"visiting\\" Giants' Super Bowl logos in front of their locker room, angering Giants players. After the Giants defeated the Jets 29‚Äì14, Giants running back Brandon Jacobs taunted Ryan, saying, \\"Time to shut up, fat boy!\\" The two reportedly came close to blows in a tense post game meeting. The Giants win over the Jets eliminated the Jets from the playoffs and helped the Giants secure the NFC East title and a spot in the playoffs, where they would go on to win Super Bowl XLVI, once again by defeating the New England Patriots. Giants kicker Lawrence Tynes called the win over the Jets the turning point of the season that spurred them onto their Super Bowl run. Despite a Super Bowl that was described as a \\"lose- lose situation\\" for the Jets as their cross-town rivals played against their division rivals, Jets owner Woody Johnson congratulated both the Giants and Patriots in a post-game statement.

Appendicitis in 1914, his spot in the opening lineup for Baltimore was taken by a 19-year-old Babe Ruth. Later, the Cincinnati Reds were given the opportunity to purchase Babe Ruth from Baltimore, but instead took Twombly and shortstop Claud Derrick. Twombly made his first appearance in a major league game on July 9, 1914, going 1-for-1 with a triple and a run scored against the Brooklyn Robins. On February 8, 1916, Twombly was sold back to Baltimore. Twombly had an exceptional season from a power standpoint in the twilight years of the dead-ball era, leading the International League in home runs with 12. He also amassed 10 triples, 21 doubles, and 158 hits for a .313 batting average in 131 games for the Orioles. Later in the 1916 season, despite majority opinion against it within the organization, Twombly was briefly brought back up to the Reds for three games as the season winded down and the team was clearly not going to make the World Series, garnering a regular season record of 60-93.1916 Cincinnati Reds baseball season at Baseball-Reference.com Twombly made no impact, reaching base only once in six plate appearances on a walk before being sent back to Baltimore. After being released by the Boston Braves partway through June 1917, Twombly announced his retirement from baseball. On August 13, 1919, Twombly was signed by George Weiss, then owner of the New Haven Weissmen of the Class A Eastern League. Twombly closed out his professional career with New Haven, hitting for a .309 average over 55 at-bats in 17 games.

The foreign body must be lodged inside tissue to be considered a splinter. Splinters may cause initial pain through ripping of flesh and muscle, infection through bacteria on the foreign object, and severe internal damage through migration to vital organs or bone over time. Splinters commonly consist of wood, but there are many other types. According to the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), common types of splinters are glass, plastic, metal, and spines of animals.Capellan O., Hollander, J.E. (2003). Management of lacerations in the emergency department. Emerg. Med. Clin. North. Am. 21, 205‚Äì31. As with any wound that breaks the skin, splinters can lead to infection, which if left untreated could develop into more serious complications. If a splinter is in the body for more than 2‚Äì3 days, or if the wound shows signs of inflammation or tenderness (whether the splinter was removed or not), advice should be sought from a doctor. Getting a splinter Generally, a splinter causes an initial feeling of pain as the sharp object makes its initial penetration through the body. Through this penetration, the object cuts through the cutaneous layer of the skin, and settles in the subcutaneous layer of the skin, and can even penetrate further down, breaking the sub-cutaneous layer, settling in muscle tissue, or even the bone. Some splinters will remain in place, but most will continue to migrate through the body, further damaging their surroundings. Types Sea urchins may cause splinters According to the AAFP, the most common foreign bodies contracted by people fall into two official classes: biological splinters, and nonbiological splinters.American College of Emergency Physicians: clinical policy for the initial approach to patients presenting with penetrating extremity trauma. Ann Emerg Med. 1999;33:612‚Äì36. In the biological class, splinters include bone, fish spines, teeth, and wood. In the nonbiological class, common splinters contracted are glass, metal, aluminum, fishhooks, pencil graphite, and plastic. Rarely, people may become infected with splinters from more unusual sources. Common cases of exotic foreign bodies include sea urchins, insect stings, stingray spines, and even grenade shrapnel. Specific details of some splinters * Wood: this type of splinter is contracted from lumber or other vegetative materials. Wood splinters must be removed from wounds because they are associated with inflammation and risk of infection. Larger or deeper splinters can result in difficult removal, or localization of the foreign body. * Fishhooks: fishhooks that become lodged in the skin are problematic because of the barbs found on the ends of most fishhooks. These barbs are designed to make removal difficult, and if care is not taken, the victim can experience tearing of not only the flesh, but the muscle as well. The most common injuries caused by fishhooks occur in the hand, face, scalp, foot, and eye. * Glass: One study found that patients were more likely to feel sensations from glass present in their skin than from any other kind of splinter. Though glass is generally detectable by radiography and is radiopaque, there is limited ability for radiography to detect glass fragments smaller than 2mm. Most glass splinters are inert, and generally lack the ability to migrate to other regions of the body. * Other: Pencil lead and other graphite foreign bodies, once lodged in the cutaneous layer of the skin, can cause permanent pigment tattooing if not removed immediately. Metallic bodies range from BB pellets to grenade shrapnel. Smaller objects can be removed without much difficulty if the depth of the wound remains superficial, but if the wound does not protrude past the subcutaneous layers of the skin, and remains inert, the object can actually remain in place. In larger objects, fragments that remain superficial in one's body may be removed without much trouble, but if wounds protrude past the subcutaneous layers of the skin and even into the muscular area or near vital organs, such objects must be left alone and immediate medical attention must be sought. * Hair: Short lengths of hair, especially stiff hair such as trimmed beard hair or pet hair, can work its way under the skin of the feet or hands. So-called \\"hair splinters\\" are commonly experienced by hairdressers and dog groomers.https://www.healthline.com/health/hair-splinter This is distinct from an ingrown hair, where a hair still attached to its follicle grows back under (or fails to emerge from) the skin. Detection Anatomy The Skin - NCI Visuals Online Splinters are often first detected by the person with the splinter in their body. There are many signs that a splinter has entered one's body. =Signs of a hidden foreign body= * Puncture wound * Blood-stained injury track of a fresh wound * Sharp pain with deep palpation over a puncture wound * Discoloration beneath the epidermis * Wound that elicits pain with movement * Wound that fails to heal * Abscess (with sterile culture) * Pain associated with a mass * Mass under the epidermis * Chronically draining purulent wound * Cyst * Granuloma formation * Sterile monoarticular arthritis * Periosteal reactions * Osteomyelitis * Pseudotumors of bone * Delayed tendon or nerve injury =Imaging= Ultrasonography of a subcutaneous splinter (in a finger) 4 x 1mm with oblique stroke. If manual detection and localization fail, the main methods for medical imaging of splinters are: * Projectional radiography ‚Äì used to locate bone, fish spines, glass, gravel-stone, metal, aluminum, pencil graphite, some plastics, teeth, and some wood (e.g., spines, cactus, thorns) * Medical ultrasonography ‚Äì used to locate glass, metal, pencil graphite, some plastics, stone, and some types of wood.Tibbles CD, Porcaro W. \\"Procedural applications of ultrasound.\\" Emerg Med Clin North Am. 2004; 22: 797‚Äì815. Small wooden splinters (1-4 mm) distant from bones are most easily detected by ultrasonography, while CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging have higher sensitivity for those near bones. Removal There are many medical techniques to remove splinters safely. Common medical techniques include the Elliptical Technique and the String Technique.Blankstein A, Cohen I, Heiman Z, Salai M, Diamant L, Heim M, et al. Ultrasonography as a diagnostic modality and therapeutic adjuvant in the management of soft tissue foreign bodies in the lower extremities. Isr Med Assoc J. 2001;3:411‚Äì3. In the elliptical technique the surrounding area of the splinter is sliced in an elliptical formation. From there the flesh in the elliptical area is cut (in the shape of an upside-down cone) and the whole chunk of flesh containing the splinter is removed. The Needle Cover Technique is limited to fishhook removal. A string is looped around the base of the hook, and as the hook is pressed further into the skin, the string is pulled, allowing the barbs to be unhooked from muscle and follow the path of the rest of the hook out of the body without snagging any additional flesh. Since the splinter has penetrated through a physical barrier of the body it allows for an individual to get an infection. The opening from the splinter will make it easier for bacteria to get into the body. It is strongly encouraged for the removal or a splinter before falling victim to an infection.  Infection  Infection is usually determined by the duration of time that the foreign object remains lodged in the human body. Objects that have included poison, deep penetration, dirt, or bite injuries generally result in a shorter time until infection is notable. According to the AAFP patients that are older, or have diabetes, or have wounds that are longer, wider, more jagged or deeper, have a much higher risk of infection. Simply the easiest way to avoid infection is to completely remove the splinters or foreign body as soon as possible. Though infection is generally the largest complication encountered with splinters, ranging from 1.1 to 12 percent presence, the use of antibiotics in non-bite cases is generally deemed unnecessary by the medical community.Broder KR, Cortese MM, Iskander JK, Kretsinger K, Slade BA, Brown KH, et al., for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Preventing tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis among adolescents: use of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccines recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). MMWR Recomm Rep. 2006;55RR-31‚Äì34. Though cases are rare, infection of foreign body wounds can result in cases of tetanus. One case of tetanus contraction through a splinter was seen in Ohio in 1993. An 80-year-old woman was presented to an ED with dysphagia and a stiff jaw. Not long after a preliminary checkup, a wood splinter was found to have been lodged in her chin for approximately 1 week; the area was erythematous with active purulent drainage. The woman was diagnosed with tetanus, admitted to the hospital, and begun on a regimen of 3,000 units of tetanus immune globulin, tetanus toxoid, and intravenous clindamycin. Despite aggressive treatment, including assisted mechanical ventilation, the patient succumbed to the effects of her primary infection and died 15 days later. The woman had no history of previous tetanus vaccinations despite previous care for a wound and ongoing medical attention for hypertension.Buttaravoli PM, Stair TO. Minor emergencies: splinters to fractures. St. Louis: Mosby, 2000;471‚Äì7. Since splinters are made of organic matter, they are much more dangerous than other types of things puncturing the body. Splinters are usually infected with many bacteria which then turn into an infection such as tetanus. Due to a splinter being made of organic matter, it makes it much more difficult for the body to get rid of it.

The team's stellar record notwithstanding, owner \\"Pop\\" Williams just broke even financially. The problem was that Berlin's Victoria Park was not big enough to accommodate the numbers the team needed to stay in the black. Deneau thought a move to Windsor might be in order, for Wigle Park was, in the words of the Windsor Evening Record, \\"one of the best baseball diamonds in Ontario.\\" So after the regular season he took the Green Sox to the Windsor area for exhibitions against local teams and encouraged Windsor leaders to consider adopting the team. He also led a Canadian League all-star team that played exhibition games in the border area. As 1912 began there was no movement in Windsor for adopting the Green Sox, and Berlin authorities were dragging their feet on the prospect of expanding the facilities at Victoria Park. In February Deneau and \\"Pop\\" Williams negotiated with the city of Waterloo about moving the Berlin team there. Nothing came of that, but by April construction had begun on improvements to the Berlin field and Deneau was hiring men to replace the six from last year who had been snapped up by the majors. \\"This City May Enter Canadian League Next Year,\\" Windsor Evening Record, Sept. 30, 1911, p. 1.
