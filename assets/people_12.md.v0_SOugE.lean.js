The story, which takes place in an alternate reality from the main Archie Comics continuity, focuses on siblings Cheryl and Jason Blossom as they compete for the title of Anti-christ. The series was created by writer Cullen Bunn and artist Laura Braga.  Publication history  In October 2018, Blossoms 666 was one of two 5-issue comic book miniseries announced by the Archie Horror imprint of Archie Comics, along with the crossover series Jughead: The Hunger vs. Vampironica. The limited series was written by Cullen Bunn and illustrated by Laura Braga. Bunn described the series as \\"one part Omen, one part Cruel Intentions, all Archie!\\" The first issue was released on January 23, 2019, making Blossoms 666 the first limited series to be published by the Archie Horror imprint. The second issue was released on March 6, the third issue on April 17, and the fourth issue on May 29. The fifth and final issue was released on July 17.  Story  The story revolves around twins Cheryl and Jason Blossom, who secretly come from a family of Satanists, as they compete for the title of Anti-christ. The Blossoms throw a pool party at their parents' mansion and invite all of their peers from Riverdale High School as part of their competition. Cheryl personally convinces Dilton Doiley to go to the party after rescuing him from Reggie Mantle's taunting, while Jason charms Miss Grundy into giving Jughead Jones an extension on a paper so that he can attend as well. At the party, the Blossom siblings play Truth or Dare with the other attendees and ask them to admit increasingly vicious truths and commit potentially homicidal dares, resulting in Betty Cooper storming off. As Jason's plan backfires and Jughead skips the party, Jason instead sets his sights on Ethel Muggs. Meanwhile, Cheryl takes Dilton into the woods where she is keeping Reggie tied to a tree. Cheryl then offers Dilton a knife and \\"dares\\" him.Blossoms 666 #1 (January 2019). The following Monday, a shadowy figure arrives in Riverdale. Dilton runs out of class after Miss Grundy notes Reggie's absence, prompting Betty to check on him. Dilton warns her to stay away and scatters at the sight of Cheryl. As Jason dismisses Cheryl's concern regarding Betty, they are met at Blossom Mansion by a sheriff who questions them about the disappearances of Reggie and Ethel. The Blossoms feign ignorance, but Cheryl suggests that the sheriff, who is revealed to be a Satanist, should talk to Dilton about Reggie. After her friends dismiss her suspicions of the Blossoms, Betty investigates the woods behind their mansion and finds a crazed Ethel, who points Betty to a cave containing a bloody Satanic idol. Admitting that Betty needs to be dealt with, Jason proposes that whoever can corrupt her \\"picture of innocence\\" shall be crowned the Anti- christ. Cheryl agrees to the terms, as does a man identifying himself as Julian Blossom, their older brother.Blossoms 666 #2 (March 2019). A flashback to the Blossom twins' birth reveals that they are actually triplets, and that the first-born Julian was taken away by cultists. In the present, Clifford and Penelope Blossom confirm that one of the three children will become the Anti- Christ. Betty misses school and witnesses Dilton being arrested by police. Feeling guilty that the group ignored Betty's concerns about the Blossoms, Archie Andrews convinces Betty's best friend Veronica Lodge to check on her. However, Cheryl insists to Veronica, also Betty's rival for Archie's affections, that Betty is manipulating the situation only to get Archie's attention. Meanwhile, Ethel tells Betty about her nightmares of the idol and, under Jason's secret orders, she sends Betty to research the Order of Abbadon. At the library, Betty finds a picture of her parents in one of the books on the Order before Julian introduces himself, offering to aid in her research so that they can take Cheryl and Jason down.Blossoms 666 #3 (April 2019). Flashbacks reveal Cheryl and Jason's more pleasant and privileged upbringing compared to Julian's. In the present, Betty finds another image of her parents in an Order of Abaddon book, this time with the Satanic idol from the cave behind the Blossom Mansion. Julian volunteers to help Betty find answers because, as he claims, Cheryl and Jason took everything from him. Meanwhile, after a freak accident nearly kills them, Cheryl and Jason agree to unite against Julian. As a result of Cheryl's previous intervening, Veronica visits Archie at home, distracting him from calling Betty. Jughead stumbles upon Ethel outside of Pop's diner and Ethel explains that she needs to show him something in the woods behind the Blossom estate. Betty invites Julian to her house to devise a plan and decides to warn her friends by sharing her findings about the Blossoms. However, Betty finds Archie and Veronica kissing and runs away upset. As Archie and Veronica embrace, he utters \\"All praise Abbadon.\\"Blossoms 666 #4 (May 2019). Ethel leads Jughead to the three-tongued idol of Abbadon and orders him to kill her as a sacrifice. When he refuses, she stabs herself. Fleeing, Jughead runs into Cheryl and Jason, with the latter ready to collect on the favor Jughead owes him. After another freak accident results in Jason saving Cheryl's life, Cheryl suggests telling the truth in order to take Julian down. With Betty feeling hurt by Veronica and Archie, Julian blames Cheryl and Jason's manipulation. Betty and Julian hope to gain answers from Dilton, but find him hanged in his cell. Julian attempts to make Betty vengeful until Jughead arrives to tell Betty the truth, resulting in Betty slapping Julian and stomping off. Returning to the Blossom Mansion, Julian is stabbed to death by Cheryl and Jason to prevent him from ruling as Anti-Christ. The Blossoms then agree to resume their competition. While being watched in Pop's diner, Betty and Jughead wonder what to do now. Elsewhere, a body under a bloodied sheet rises.Blossoms 666 #5 (July 2019).  Characters  * Cheryl Blossom: A popular student at Riverdale High School and a member of the wealthy, and secretly Satanist, Blossom family. Between her and her brothers Jason and Julian, one of them is the Anti-christ, and the siblings compete with each other for the title. * Jason Blossom: A popular student at Riverdale High School and a member of the wealthy, and secretly Satanist, Blossom family. Between him and his sister Cheryl and brother Julian, one of them is the Anti-christ, and the siblings compete with each other for the title. * Julian Blossom: Cheryl and Jason's older triplet brother who was taken away at birth by cultists.

Kevin Keller and Moose Mason make brief appearances in the first issue as attendees of the Blossom pool party. In later issues, Alice and Hal Cooper also appear in photographs.  Reception  Blossoms 666 received positive reviews from professional critics. The series holds an average critic rating of 8.1 out of 10 on the review aggregation website Comic Book Roundup, based on 32 reviews. Patrick Cavanaugh of ComicBook.com gave the first issue a rating of 5 out of 5, praising the creative team and adding, \\"Blossoms 666 keeps up the tradition of Archie Horror by finding the perfect way to balance what readers already know about characters with terrifying horror movie tropes.\\" Joey Edsall of Newsarama gave the debut issue a rating of 8 out of 10, calling it \\"a great issue in its own right\\" and said that Bunn, Braga, and colorist Matt Herms \\"excel at both imbuing the more gothic scenes and locale with a thick atmosphere of dread and at making the juxtaposition between the world of the Blossoms and the rest of Riverdale's youths pronounced without being overly jarring.\\" Cavanaugh gave the second issue a rating of 4 out of 5, writing, \\"Blossoms 666 continues to walk the line between a campy teen drama and a horrifying exploration of cults in a small town, with [Bunn and Braga] showing their skills with both tones. [...] The narrative didn't drive forward too much, the issue's only shortcoming, yet this just leaves us with more places to go, with this chapter remaining engaging and entertaining.\\" Nathan Koffler of Comics: The Gathering rated the issue 10 out of 10, crediting Bunn's writing for producing \\"an amazing issue that is full of tension, drama, and wickedness with characters that are sexy, intimidating, and menacing.\\" He also praised Braga for illustrating those elements \\"beautifully\\" and said that she did \\"an exceptional job at turning those [...] characters into visuals for us to fall in love with.\\" For the third issue, Cavanaugh reported a rating of 5 out of 5. He applauded the new narrative wrinkle in Julian Blossom for breaking with the book's darker themes and for \\"[putting] the story in a position to take some unexpected twists and turns, making an already intriguing story even more mysterious. The book continues to walk the fine line between being a straightforward horror story and a campy adventure, which is a highly entertaining delight for all fans of the darker side of Riverdale.\\" Reviewing for Comic Watch, Nicholas Osborn praised the issue's pacing and artistry, giving it an overall rating of 9 out of 10. He concluded, \\"Blossoms 666 #3 deepens the mystery with compelling developments and an emphasis on character drama.\\" The fourth issue received a rating of 4 out of 5 from Cavanaugh, who noted that the issue largely serves to \\"[move] important pieces around the board to set up the story for some exciting reveals.\\" He felt that, \\"Despite the slight stagnation of the narrative momentum, we're still delivered a creepy and charming story exploring the seedier side of Riverdale, making for an entertaining read for all fans of the darker interpretations of Archie Comics.\\" Multiversity Comics Michael Govan gave the issue a rating of 5.5 out of 10. He criticized the characterization of Julian and the inclusion of the Betty-Archie-Veronica love triangle, but praised the comparable appearances of the characters to the actors who play their live-action counterparts on the television series Riverdale. Cavanaugh of ComicBook.com described the fifth and final issue as \\"ambiguous and underwhelming\\" but again praised the artwork, which he felt \\"[makes] the book work well tonally, even without a single bubble of dialogue.\\" With a rating of 4 out of 5, he concluded, \\"The dialogue between the characters feels authentic and engaging, yet the events of the actual book feel as though the storyline ran out of steam and serves more as a collection of scenes than an organic ending.\\" Beyond The Panels Jideobi Odunze gave the issue an overall rating of 7.5 out of 10. He offered a mixed reaction to the artwork, criticizing the amount of off-panel action, but wrote, \\"The only thing that really sold those moments were the reaction shots and terrified expressions. To that extent they did succeed in creating engagement with the tone of the story.\\"  References  Category:Fictional depictions of the Antichrist Category:Horror fiction Category:Horror comics Category:2019 in comics ","title":"Blossoms 666"},{"id":"59750771","text":"IC 1459 (also catalogued as IC 5265) is an elliptical galaxy located in the constellation Grus. It is located at a distance of circa 85 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that IC 1459 is about 130,000 light years across. It was discovered by Edward Emerson Barnard in 1892.  Characteristics  IC 1459 is a giant elliptical galaxy. In its core has been observed a fast counter-rotating stellar component, with an estimated total mass of . The stars of this component have circular orbits on a flat disk with a radius of less than two arcseconds. It has been suggested that the stars of the counterrotating disk are of external origin, either by the accretion of a stellar satellite or of a dense molecular cloud from which the stars were created. The galaxy also features multiple shells and disturbed isophotes, which indicate that it has accreted material, probably by the merger of smaller galaxies with the elliptical galaxy. Enhanced photography revealed the presence of a diffuse spiral pattern at the outer regions of IC 1459. It has been suggested that a merger started a starburst event in IC 1459. The total duration of this event has not been well constrained, but it is estimated it lasted less than 80 million years. Young stars make up approximately 3% of the total stellar population of the galaxy. They have an average age of 400 million years. Metallicity has been found to decrease as the radial distance from the center increases. The nucleus of IC 1459 is active and has been characterised as a LINER based on its optical spectrum. The most accepted theory for the power source of active galactic nuclei is the presence of an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. In the centre of IC 1459 lies a supermassive black hole with an estimated mass based on stellar velocities. Estimates of the mass of the black hole based on gas kinematics are lower, from (1-4) √ó 108 to 109 , although the presence of non- gravitational forces acting on the circumnuclear gas renders them less accurate. The disturbed kinematics of the circumnuclear gas may be caused by an outflow. In the circumnuclear region there is also dust with irregular distribution, indicating nonequilibrium motions. The galaxy is characterised as low-power radio loud, with gigahertz-peaked spectrum, and has two symmetrical radio jets. In a 3.5 year observation period, the galaxy showed little variability. The galaxy also has weak X-ray emission. The nucleus appears unabsorbed in lower energy X-ray, with X-ray luminosity ergs s-1, while the Fe-KŒ± fluorescence line, is not strong. The infrared emission of the nucleus is also less than the one expected by an AGN hidden by a dust torus. This indicates that the AGN is seen unobstructed. The galaxy possess an X-ray halo, whose modelling indicated the presence of dark matter at a distance larger than 3 effective radii. In images by the Hubble Space Telescope, 199 globular clusters were recognised, with an indication of a decrease of their number near the core and statistically non-significant evidence of dimodial color distribution.  Nearby galaxies  IC 1459 is the brightest galaxy in a galaxy group known as the IC 1459 group. It is a loose group centred at IC 1459 with a large number of spiral galaxies. Other members include NGC 7418, NGC 7418A, NGC 7421, IC 5264, IC 5269, IC 5269B, IC 5270, and IC 5273. IC 5264 lies 6.5 arcminutes south of IC 1459. This group, along with the NGC 7582 group form the Grus cloud, a region of elevated galaxy density. The Grus cloud, along with the nearby Pavo-Indus cloud, lies between the Local Supercluster and Pavo-Indus Supercluster. The group features both diffuse X-ray emission from the intergalactic medium and HI emission. Based on the presence of both it has been suggested that the group is in its early stages of assembling from different subgroups. Three HI clouds have been found to be associated with the group, two located near IC 5270 and one near NGC 7418. These HI clouds are believed to have formed from gas stripped from the galaxies as a result of interactions.

The designation Type 7 indicates its year of introduction, the seventh year of the reign of Emperor Taish≈ç, or 1918 according to the Gregorian calendar.  Design  The Type 7 was conventional for its time and other nations had similar weapons such as the Italian Obice da 305/17, Russian 11-inch mortar M1877, and the 12-inch coast defense mortar from the United States. The theory of operation for the Type 7 was that a low- velocity howitzer firing a large shell at a high-angle was more likely to destroy an enemy ship by penetrating its thin deck armor than a high-velocity low-angle gun attempting to penetrate its thicker belt armor. The downside was that high-angle fire was harder to aim correctly so more howitzers would be needed to defend an area from attack. However, if the area was constrained by geography like a port at the mouth of a river the navigation channels could be measured ahead of time and firing ranges calculated. A complicating factor was as naval artillery progressed their size and range soon eclipsed its range. The Type 7 howitzer was introduced to supplement the Armstrong-designed 28 cm L/10 howitzer as coastal artillery with a secondary siege artillery role. Although it had a caliber of , it was referred to as a 30 cm howitzer. The Type 7s were typical built-up guns of the period, with rifled steel inner tubes and layers of external reinforcing hoops. The guns had interrupted screw breeches and fired separate loading cased charges and projectiles. Firing was by percussion cap and hammer tripped by a long lanyard. There were two variants of the Type 7 produced, one with a short, L/16 caliber, barrel, and one with a long, L/23 caliber, barrel. The long barreled version weighed nearly twice as much as the short barreled version. The Type 7s were mounted on garrison mounts which consisted of large rectangular steel platforms approximately long, and wide, set on top of large circular geared steel rings set in concrete. This mount allowed 360¬∞ of traverse and +2¬∞ to +73¬∞ of elevation. The recoil system for the Type 7 consisted of a U shaped gun cradle which held the trunnioned barrel and a slightly inclined firing platform with a hydro-gravity recoil system above the breech. When the gun fired, the hydraulic buffers slowed the recoil of the cradle which slid up a set of inclined rails on the firing platform and then returned the gun to position by the combined action of the buffers and gravity. Two equilibrators were mounted below the barrel and two compressed air-tanks were mounted on the carriage for blowing out the tube after firing.  History  In 1933, the short-barreled Type 7 was modified so that it could be quickly disassembled into nine wagon loads, transported and reassembled on site. The wagons were able to be towed by artillery tractors at a speed of . In February 1940, two Type 7 long- barreled howitzers were moved to the Kot≈ç fortress in Manchuria to strengthen Japanese defenses in the event of a Soviet attack. The Japanese army had eight fortresses built along the border with the Soviet Union, of which the Kot≈ç fortress on the Ussuri River was the strongest. Large-scale fortifications, similar to the Maginot Line, were guarded by the 4th Border Guard Unit. The 1,400-strong crew had two batteries of field guns and howitzers, two Type 90 240 mm railway guns, and one experimental 41 cm howitzer. When the Soviets attacked the Japanese positions around the Kot≈ç fortress in Operation August Storm in 1945, the entire fortress crew and all guns were lost. It is believed that ten Type 7s were used by the Japanese during the Battle of Corregidor in 1942. In 1944, the 4th Independent Heavy Artillery Battalion with Type 7 short-barreled howitzers was ordered to the Philippines in anticipation of American landings. At the top of the picture is a Type 7 which was captured by US soldiers of the 158th Regiment on Luzon. The depicted gun position was roughly wide and deep. The howitzer was disguised by a house that could be pushed back on rails just before firing. A garden with banana trees was planted around the position to increase the camouflage effect. Four Type 7s were used for coastal defense on Honshu in 1945.

After education at St Paul's School, London, he studied medicine at Guy‚Äôs Hospital and graduated MB BS Lond in 1911. At Guy's Hospital he was from 1911 to 1914 a demonstrator in physiology and medical registrar. In 1914 he joined the RAMC and was sent to France as a medical officer in the British Expeditionary Force. For his medical service in France he was twice mentioned in despatches and in 1917 was appointed OBE. In a hospital in France he married Belle, a British nurse, a few days before the Armistice. He was demobilised with the rank of major and resumed academic work, earning a higher MD with gold medal in 1920. In 1920 he also qualified MRCP. At Guy's Hospital he was appointed medical officer in charge of the tuberculosis department and became subdean of the medical school. He was elected FRCP in 1928. In 1934 Marshall joined the staff of the Royal Brompton Hospital. In the late 1940s he furthered the introduction and use of streptomycin for pulmonary tuberculosis. He was appointed chairman of the clinical trials committee of the Medical Research Council. He gave in 1949 the Harveian Oration on Individuality in medicine. (Harveian Oration) Marshall was one of the founders of the Thoracic Society, which in 1946 started publication of the journal Thorax. (The Thoracic Society was amalgamated in 1982 into the British Thoracic Society.) For his service as honorary consulting physician to the Ministry of Pensions and as principal referee to the Civil Service Committee, he was in 1951 appointed CBE. In 1951 he was also appointed KCVO for his service as physician to King George VI. In 1951 Clement Price Thomas operated on the King for lung cancer, and Geoffrey Marshall stayed at Buckingham Palace to supervise the King's recovery from the operation. He was the co-editor, with Kenneth Murray Allan Perry, of Diseases of the Chest (vol. 2, 1952). Marshall wrote \\"Diseases of the respiratory tract\\" in Conybeare's Textbook of Medicine and many articles. He was president of the Royal Society of Medicine from 1958 to 1960. He was elected honorary FRCPI in 1965. Geoffrey Marshall's first wife died in 1974. Their only child, a son David, died in WWII in a military hospital in Cairo from wound diphtheria.

She was intended for service in the Imperial Russian Navy‚Ä≤s Baltic Fleet. Ships of this type were characterized by good seaworthiness, practical location of guns, and rational interior planning. The ship was armed with seventy-four 24- and 36-pound cannons.Warships in the Baltic fleet: Ingermanland randewy.ru  Fatal maiden voyage On August 8, 1842, the ship left Arkhangelsk on her maiden voyage. To reach her destination of Kronstadt in the Gulf of Finland, she had to make a rough voyage through the White Sea, Barents Sea, Norwegian Sea, North Sea, Skagerrak, and Baltic Sea. On board were just under 900 people (the sources vary in their numbers), mainly male crew, with food and supplies for the sea voyage. The ship met its destiny along the south coast of Norway. Off Lindesnes, the ship encountered a severe storm. Off Kristiansand in the strait of Skagerrak, Ingermanland sailed with Oks√∏y Lighthouse on the port side in the conviction that the light of the lighthouse was the lantern on another ship. The crew thought they were far from shore, but shortly after, the ship grounded on the islet of Gr√∏nningen at about 10 o'clock on the evening on September 12. After the grounding, the ship was refloated by high waves and drifted to the west with the wind. The crew fired the cannons as a distress signal. The alarm was heard, but would-be rescue vessels had to give up because they could not keep up with the ship in the strong wind. Next contact was off Mandal, where pilot vessels and other local ships managed to rescue a total of 15 people. The ship continued drifting westward while local vessels followed. Rescuers again reached her, rescuing another 183, and later another 120, people. A lifeboat with 19 people aboard ‚Äì among them Captain Treskin ‚Äì was picked up off Lista. A boat with 15 people on board was picked up by a ship in the Skagerrak and taken to Copenhagen, Denmark. Another lifeboat with 10 people on board was driven ashore on Eiger√∏y and one officer was picked up by pilots from Stavanger. Ingermanland finally sank off Varhaug.

He subsequently received over 500 orders to produce similar videos for other games such as Overwatch and was also commissioned by Twitch streamer Ninja to produce a similar video to solicit Twitch subscriptions. In November 2018, Accetturo was banned from Fiverr without warning, later citing the numerous \\"credit card scam\\" videos he starred in. , Accetturo said he was still owed \\"thousands of dollars\\" by Fiverr.

Stallmeister of the Court of His Imperial Majesty Nicholas II, Active State Councillor. A member of many Russian scientific societies. Biography =Early years= Nikolay Gondatti was born in 1860 in Moscow to the family of an Italian professional sculptor Ludwig Gondatti and a Russian noblewoman from Tula (sources do not give her either name or maiden name). At the age of 15, Nikolay entered the Nizhny Novgorod Aleksandrovsky Institute, which at that time represented a secondary school with a classical liberal education. In 1881 he graduated with a gold medal.Fiftieth Anniversary of the Nizhny Novgorod Noble Institute In 1887 he graduated with honors from the Faculty of Law and Faculty of Physics and Mathematics (Natural History Department) of Moscow University. Every year, until 1892, he participated in expeditions and visited various provinces of the Russian Empire, Germany, England, Turkey, Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt, Austria, France, India, Ceylon, China, Japan and America; he had gold medals for the expedition to Western Siberia and for his collection of collections on sericulture. In 1887, he was appointed a teacher of natural science at the School of the Order of Saint Catherine, and from January 1, 1888 ‚Äì at the Moscow Alexander Institute.Fiftieth Anniversary of the Nizhny Novgorod Noble Institute =Governor of Tomsk Governorate (1908‚Äì1911)= On September 15, 1908 he was appointed Tomsk governor, arrived in Tomsk on October 18, 1908. With his participation in the city of Tomsk opened the Higher Women's Courses. In 1909, participates in a meeting in Saint Petersburg on the needs of Siberia. An honorary citizen of the city of Novonikolayevsk (now Novosibirsk). The title was awarded on May 3, 1910 for numerous achievements in helping the city in the fire of May 1909. Here is how it is stated on the official website of the city of Novosibirsk:The official site of the city of Novosibirsk > On May 11, 1909, a terrible disaster happened in Novonikolayevsk ‚Äì a large > fire that started in the central part of the city, which quickly spread in > the direction of the Ob. The city burned for four days. According to the > city council, 794 courtyards were burned out. 8 thousand people were left > homeless. A major administrator, a researcher of Northern and Northeastern > Siberia, and Tomsk Governor Nikolay Lvovich Gondatti, who began the > investigation of the causes of the disaster and questioned city officials, > arrived to inspect the fire.

For these services, Nikolay Gondatti became an Honorary > resident of the city of Novo-Nikolaevsk. The city soon recovered and > continued to grow with even greater rapidity. By the decision of the Tomsk City Council of February 9, 1911, Nikolay Gondatti was awarded the title of Honorary Citizen of the city of Tomsk. In 1910 he was appointed head of the Amur Expedition. The Amur expedition under the leadership of Gondatti was the last scientific action of pre-revolutionary Russia, and the results were very significant. On the expedition treasury released 600 thousand rubles. This well-organized and equipped expedition, contrary to expectations, had almost no effect on the tsarist government's resettlement policy, although its works (more than 40 volumes) were promptly published. =Amur Governor-General (1911‚Äì1917)= In this post, he did a lot for the economic, social and cultural development of the region, firmly defended it against the expansion of Japan and China. Under the governorship of Gondatti in the Amur region, social activity intensified, the Kedrovaya Pad nature reserve was established, a teacher's institute was opened in Khabarovsk in 1914, schools were built in the villages. Gondatti paid special attention to the life of the indigenous population of the Amur region, prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages in camps. He was a direct participant and chief guardian of the construction of a unique bridge across the Amur River and the Amur Railroad, thanks to which the Amur Territory overcame its isolation and was able to become part of the economic system of Russia. He succeeded in realizing plans for connecting the Ussurian railway with the Amur railway with access to the Trans-Baikal railway. He initiated the construction of the port of Vladivostok and the clearing of the mouth of the Amur River near Nikolayevsk, and in every way encouraged the development of trade, crafts, agriculture and industry. Negative about the influence of China, Korea and Japan in the Russian Far East, he was also a supporter of attracting foreign capital to the region. Such vital issues as the development of the veterinary service and the formation of the meteorological service in the region, the organization of extensive land management work and the dacha settlement near Vladivostok, the creation of the first reserve and the department of the Russian society of Oriental studies did not remain out of his attention. As the first civil governor-general, who also had a great intellectual potential, Nikolay Gondatti had a beneficial effect on the moral atmosphere in the region, on the development of science, education and culture here. \\"Dear to my heart region\\", ‚Äì this is how he defined his attitude to the Amur region in one of the articles in the newspaper. Indeed, he, like Nikolay Grodekov, cordially treated the region, its population. He devoted 16 years of fruitful work to the far eastern outskirts of Russia, having traveled from the head of the circumpolar district, Chukotka, to the highest rank in the local administrative bureaucracy of Russia, the governor-general of a vast and young region, who held an extremely responsible geopolitical position. The style of work of the Governor-General was characterized by initiative, perseverance in defending the interests of the region in front of the government, studying the state of affairs on the spot, demanding of subordinates. Friendliness and accessibility attracted people to him. Nikolay Lvovich possessed another valuable quality, without which one cannot fully understand many of his actions ‚Äì he was an ascetic, that is, a man ready for the common good to accomplish the feat, able to endure discomfort for the sake of an important country: endure hardship and physical overload. Nikolay Gondatti was awarded the title of honorary citizen of the city of Khabarovsk in 1911. Gondatti's career ended in March 1917 with the abdication of Nicholas II. A public security committee elected in Khabarovsk decided to arrest Gondatti as soon as he arrived on a train from a business trip. Gondatti was arrested and sent under escort to Petrograd, to the Emergency Commission to investigate the iniquities and abuses committed by the tsarist ministers and major dignitaries. The commission did not find any serious abuse of power by Gondatti, and he was released. At the end of May 1917, Gondatti resigned. At the invitation of the University of Helsingfors (Helsinki), he lectured on ethnography. =Head of the Land Department of the Chinese Eastern Railway= In the city of Harbin since December 1918. In July 1922, the Amur Zemstvo Council proposed Gondatti to the post of Provisional Ruler of the Amur State, but Gondatti withdrew his candidacy. He avoided the \\"doubtful\\", in his opinion, cooperation with the Merkulovs. It is known for certain that Gondatti refused to become the banner of counter-revolution in the Far East. In 1923, at the request of the Bolsheviks, was arrested by the Manchurian authorities. Under pressure from Japan, the Bolsheviks put him not in prison, but in the hospital. In Harbin, he worked together with Nikolay Sviyagin, whom he met and worked in Russia. Both died and were buried in Harbin. The reference book \\"The Whole Harbin\\" for 1925 reports that Nikolay Gondatti, since 1918, heads the scientific and land department of the Chinese Eastern Railway and rents a rather modest apartment in a corner building along Bolshoy Prospekt. In Harbin, Nikolay Gondatti was active in social and scientific work. He soon became chairman of the Society of Russian Orientalists, the oldest Russian research association in Manchuria, which existed from 1909 to 1927. In 1920, the question was raised about opening a technical school in Harbin, as the Chinese Eastern Railway began to feel an acute need for technical personnel and sought to hire them. The Society for the Establishment of a Russian- Chinese Technical School in the City of Harbin was organized, which was headed by Lieutenant-General Dmitry Horvat, and Nikolay Gondatti was appointed chairman of the board. Classes in the new school began on October 18, 1920. The technical school gradually developed its technical equipment and strengthened its authority. On April 2, 1922, the Russian-Chinese Technical School was transformed into a Russian-Chinese Polytechnic Institute ‚Äì the first higher technical educational institution in Harbin. The main burden of managing the reorganization of this university, negotiations with the senior management of the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Harbin community organizations regarding its future development plans fell on the shoulders of Nikolay Gondatti, the head of the Land Department of the Chinese Eastern Railway Board, who in 1923 became the chairman of the board of the society for the establishment of the Russian-Chinese Polytechnic Institute and later Harbin Polytechnic Institute. With the help of Nikolay Gondatti in Modyagou in August 1924 the Kazan-Bogorodsky monastery was founded.Russian Orthodoxy in the city of Harbin At the end of 1924, he was chairman of the Manchurian Agricultural Society, whose main task was the dissemination of agricultural knowledge and work to improve local livestock and agricultural crops in Northern Manchuria. Thus, while in exile, Nikolay Gondatti held major administrative and public posts, doing his best for the good of the Russian people who found themselves not in their will in a foreign country. Nikolay Gondatti died in Harbin in April 1946. He was buried at the New Cemetery, which to this day has not survived. Awards For service, Gondatti was awarded the Order of Saint Vladimir, 3rd and 4th classes, Order of Saint Stanislaus, 2nd and 3rd classes, including one for studying the Siberian suburbs, Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky, a silver medal in memory of the reign of Emperor Alexander III and a bronze medal \\"For the works on the first General Population Census of 1897\\".

Clark start at Class 3 scrambling and range up to Class 5.5 via the central South Face. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Dungeness River. History The first ascent of the mountain was made on August 21, 1940 by George R. Martin and Elvin Johnson who dubbed the peak Mt. Belvedere. The mountain was officially named in 1965 to honor Irving M. Clark (1882-1960), a Seattle conservationist and leader in the establishment of Olympic National Park. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Clark is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. In terms of favorable weather, the best months for climbing are June through September.

They were born out of the necessity to establish a graphic codification for the Catalan language, which at the moment did not have a unitary spelling. These rules formed, until the publication in 2017 of Ortografia catalana, the basis for the spelling of modern Catalan. They were published by the end of January 1913, and disseminated by the press. For instance, they were fully reproduced in the article \\"For the unit of the language. The Orthographic Norms of the Institute of Catalan Studies\\", published in La Veu de Catalunya on January 31, 1913 (p.3-4).  Goals and process of elaboration of the rules  The authors' aim was to put the language at the same \\"level\\" as other European languages ‚Äìi.e. making it usable for all literary genres and in all forms of communication: science, administration, education, legislation, commerce, and the press. To establish this set of rules, the Institut d‚ÄôEstudis Catalans (Institute of Catalan Studies) created a commission with members from all of its departments: Antoni Maria Alcover, Josep Carner i Ribalta, Frederic Clascar, Pompeu Fabra, Llu√≠s Segal√† i Estalella, Jaume Mass√≥ i Torrents, Miquel dels Sants Oliver, Antoni Rubi√≥ i Lluch, Pere Coromines i Montanya, and Eugeni d'Ors. Pompeu Fabra was in charge of preparing a proposal for the rules that was studied, debated, and voted on by the commission members. In creating these rules, they provided the Catalan language with the essential foundation for taking on subsequent codification efforts, a grammar (1918) and a dictionary (1932).  Reactions to the rules  These rules were adopted almost immediately by the daily press and a wide range of magazines, as well as the majority of writers. The establishment of these rules also allowed for the teaching of Catalan in schools and universities. Enric Prat de la Riba called for the unity and discipline of the Catalan people in this matter and, because of that, local bodies decided to adopt the new spelling rules. The role of culture and politics was key for this success, which consequently led to the unity of the language and its recovery. Despite this strong reception both at an official and a popular level, the rules were initially rejected by a non-discountable number of personalities. Amongst the people opposed to the norms were such scholars as Francesc Carreras i Candi, Jaume Collell i Bancells, Josep Franquesa i Gomis, Francesc Matheu i Fornells, Apel¬∑les Mestres, Ramon Miquel i Planas, Ernest Molin√© i Bras√©s, etc., who in 1915 created the Acad√®mia de la Llengua Catalana (Catalan Language Academy) and wrote their own Regles ortogr√†fiques (\\"Orthographic Rules\\"), published in 1916, which did not spread.

Viola Neblett (March 5, 1842 ‚Äì April 30, 1897) was an American temperance activist, suffragist, and women's rights pioneer. She was an indefatigable worker for temperance in Greenville, South Carolina, and was the first woman in her state to declare herself unreservedly for woman suffrage over her own signature in the public prints. She was a notable participant in the annual convention of this Association at Atlanta in 1895, and later spent months in Washington, D.C. in the endeavor to secure the enfranchisement of women under the new constitution of South Carolina. In her last days, she planned a bequest to the National American Woman Suffrage Association. In her own town, she founded and endowed the Neblett Free Library, her home becoming Greenville's first library. Early years Viola Wright, whose first name was Ann or Adelaide, was born in Hamburg, Aiken County, South Carolina, March 5, 1842. Six months after her birth, her parents returned to their home in Augusta, Georgia. Her father, Adrian Wright, died before Viola turned eight. She is a descendant of two old Virginia families, the Ligons, of Amelia County, Virginia and the Christians, of the Virginia Peninsula, who were originally from the Isle of Wight. Her maternal great-grandfather was a captain in the Revolutionary War and served with distinction. Her grandmother was a Methodist preacher's wife, class-leader and Bible-reader. Neblett's girlhood and early womanhood were passed in a quiet home in Augusta. The abolition of slavery and its enforcement at the close of the Civil War reduced her grandmother, her mother and herself to poverty, and, but for the help of a former slave, they would have suffered for food in 1865. Career =Temperance= In February 1867, she married James M. Neblett, of Virginia, a successful businessman. They made their name in Augusta till autumn 1879, after which time they removed to Greenville, South Carolina, with her mother and his aunt, Susan Turnispeed. Here, Neblett became friends with Mary Putnam Gridley, as well as George and Sarah Sirrine. Neblett was a charter member of Greenville's first women's organization, the Thursday Club. She wrote the club's bylaws and co-founded the club's first paper with Sarah Sirrine. Her focus on temperance occurred as it was \\"the only cause, aside from church work, that most men considered acceptable for women to champion\\". She became an indefatigable Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) worker, demonstrating executive ability and expending a great amount of her time. She forged an alliance with Virginia Durant Young at the WCTU convention in 1880. =Suffrage and women's rights= In 1890, in Greenville, Neblett formed the South Carolina Equal Rights Association, alternating the presidency with Young. Neblett was the first woman in South Carolina to declare herself for woman suffrage, over her own signature, in the public prints, which was an act of heroism and might have meant social ostracism in the conservative South. In March 1895, she traveled in South Carolina making appointments for speakers who were to canvass the State in April or May in the interest of the woman's suffrage movement. In August, Neblett spent some days in Washington D.C., including visits with the editor of The Woman's Tribune. Neblett intended to camp with the South Carolina Constitutional Convention, which was to meet September 15, with the expectation that South Carolina would be the third to adopt woman's suffrage. Female suffragists, headed by Nesblett, arrived at the Convention, but with small prospects of securing consideration. They made many friends among the delegates, supplied their desks with suffrage literature, and had hearings before two committees, before which they presented their arguments, and eventually had a public hearing before the whole convention in the state house. On September 17, Neblett, Young, and Laura Clay of Kentucky, addressed the Convention on behalf of woman suffrage, but the newspapers reported that there was no likelihood of the Convention attendees acceding to their wishes. Although the woman's suffrage initiative was not passed, Neblett and Young were instrumental in having the age of consent raised from ten to fourteen, and for women gaining the right to be their children's legal guardians. =Religion= After years of study and mature thought on theological questions, she took broader and more liberal views concerning the Bible and its teachings, and was in accord with the advanced religious thought of her day. Having been reared amid slavery, seeing its downfall and observing the African American since 1865, she believed that the elevation of the African American must come through education. =Nesblett Free Library= James Neblett died in 1890 or December 28, 1891, after a long illness. He had sustained and encouraged her in her charitable work throughout their married life. In 1892, Nesblett and Turnispeed made oral agreements and wills leaving the property of each to the survivor. In 1896, Nesblett's religious and political beliefs caused estrangement between herself and Turnispeed, with whom she had lived for years, so in the same year, Nesblett created a new will in which nearly all her property was to be given to the Neblett library, which had already been established by her. Neblett died April 30, 1897, and was buried at Magnolia Cemetery in Augusta. Nesblett left her property, valued at about , and money, to a free library association, composed mostly of Unitarians. The name Unity library was then changed to Neblett library. Turnispeed brought suit to break the will, alleging a contract whereby Nesblett and Turnispeed made wills in 1892, leaving the property of each to the survivor. It was alleged that Nesblett destroyed this will and contract and made a will benefiting the library while under the influence of morphine, having acquired that habit by taking the drug during illness (cancer). In 1900, the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled in favor of Turnispeed such that the will was overturned and the library did not gain the left to it by Nesblett. As Nesblett had turned over her private residence to the library trustees in 1896, before creating her second will, the building was not involved in the supreme court's decision. The bequest to the National American Woman Suffrage Association was not over-turned by the supreme court decision.

He is largely self-taught and some of his artwork is politically motivated and includes paintings, drawings, sculptures and multi-media. Early education Hildebrando de Melo was born in Bailundo, Angola and spent his early childhood in Lobito. He is the grandson of King Ekuikui II of Bailundo, and his parents and grandparents worked in the Angolan government. At an early age, De Melo had instilled inside him a desire to be politically active. When he was five years old, he moved to Porto, Portugal to live with his grandmother, Laura de Melo. Though the move was intended to be temporary (de Melo was sick and his parents believed his situation would be better in Portugal), after he recovered he remained in Portugal. While growing up in Portugal, de Melo enjoyed playing at the beach, in the forests, and watching American films. Hildebrando de Melo converted to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at age 14, when his grandmother joined the same church. After his grandmother's death, de Melo's aunt and uncle moved to a small town and sent him to work in a factory. When he was 11 or 12, an art teacher gave him advanced lessons in painting and taught him about modern art. It was not until he turned 18, in 1996, that de Melo returned to his birth family in Angola, some of which he had not yet met. His art techniques are mostly self-taught. Returning to Angola De Melo was anxious to return to his family in Angola and get to know them better, but it did not come without its difficulties. Though his community in Angola spoke fluent Portuguese, it was not the same Portuguese de Melo grew up speaking, nor did he remember the language of his Mbundu people. Angola was also different from what de Melo remembered: due to their civil war that began three years before de Melo was born and would not end until 2002, the country was in constant flux. However, de Melo was celebrated for having returned to Angola at such a turbulent time when he had the option to remain in Europe. De Melo decided in his early 20s that he wanted to become a professional artist. He initially received some pushback from his father who hoped Hildebrando would choose a different career, but that would change and Hildebrando would receive his father‚Äôs support. He currently lives in Angola with his wife Maria and their kids. Artistic Influences and Process De Melo‚Äôs art is very personal. He said, ‚ÄúEverything I have experienced, I‚Äôve put on canvas.‚Äù De Melo studied the history of Angola and tribal art before starting to create his own art, which is often politically motivated. Corpo e Alma (Body and Soul) from 2005 is a series of eighteen works that uses collage, graffiti, and abstraction to protest war and corruption in Angola. His works, raw and accusatory, address colonization, civil war, racism, slavery, fear, pain, survival, blood, and more. According to de Melo, he has been threatened, poisoned, imprisoned, and beaten for his artwork. However, not all of de Melo‚Äôs art is political‚Äîit is also spiritual. He often makes religious references, including pasting pages from the Bible in Kikongo (the first African language that the Bible was translated into) in his collages. He also asks existential questions with his art. De Melo has described his work as minimalist. In an interview, he stated: \\"I like to keep things very simple so people understand me.\\" De Melo works primarily in series or intense bursts of activity; during these bursts, he will typically produce about two dozen works based on a shared theme. As a young professional artist, de Melo learned to paint in the dark because of the frequent power outages in Angola. He is also interested in the relationship between music and painting, often listening to Jazz artists like Miles Davis as he paints. When he was a teenager in Portugal, de Melo trained as a welder. This is apparent in his iron sculptures that he began working with in 2014. Quotes ‚ÄúI think a person is a fruit of his experience. If I were born in New York, I would be a New Yorker.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd everything I have experienced, I‚Äôve put on canvas.‚Äù Exhibitions In 2013, the Museum of Natural History in Luanda exhibited eleven paintings and 10 drawings de Melo entitled \\"God.\\" From February 16 to March 6, 2016, de Melo exhibited Expand at THAT ART FAIR, sponsored by ArtAfrica magazine in Cape Town, South Africa. Also in 2016, de Melo exhibited sixteen sculptures at the Cam√µes-Portuguese Cultural Center in Luanda from November 24 to December 15. In 2017, he exhibited works made from paper in Pap√©is at the Dr. Ant√≥nio Agostinho Neto Memorial in Luanda. He participated in Jaipur Kala Chaupal artistic residence and festival. From December 2018 to January 2019, de Melo exhibited artwork at the Espa√ßo Mude in Portugal. His Apropria√ß√£o (Appropriation) exhibited at Lab Art & Co, a modern art gallery in Angola, from January 2018 to March 2019. The Mormon Arts Center produced an exhibit of de Melo's work entitled Nzambi (God), which was curated by Glen Nelson. After exhibiting at the Mormon Arts festival, Nzambi was exhibited in the Harold B. Lee Library at Brigham Young University. Because of the difficulty in moving artwork from Angola, de Melo painted the works in the exhibit while he was visiting New York during a residency program. In addition to these exhibitions, de Melo has also exhibited in solo and group exhibitions in Germany, India, Spain, and Holland. He has exhibited twice at the Venice Biennale.

Two slightly different examples were completed and flown successfully, but persistent concerns about structural strength eventually saw them grounded. Development S√°ndor Svachulay's aim in designing the Szent Gy√∂rgy, nicknamed Gyuri (Georgie), was to produce the smallest single seat glider. An all wood aircraft with a complex gull wing, the Gy√∂rgy was built in his own workshop. The first flights were made in the spring of 1933. A second, modified example was built soon after, following concerns about the strength of the Gy√∂rgy I's wing bracing. The bracing was altered, the span reduced, the empennage modified and the cockpit brought forward. Named Szent Gy√∂rgy II, this aircraft first flew on 3 September 1933. The two gliders flew for another 18 months, their best recorded flight lasting 52 minutes. After that the concerns about structural strength surfaced again and the two gliders were officially grounded. The Gy√∂rgy I was abandoned but Svachulay passed the second aircraft to two of his students at the Technical University who strengthened it and flew it again. In September 1935 it crashed and was destroyed. Design The Szent Gy√∂rgy was an all wood aircraft, its wing built around four spars and shoulder mounted. Each half-wing had two panels, the inner one with a rectangular plan and 10¬∞ of dihedral and an outer panel with a trapezoidal plan, 20¬∞ of sweep and 2.2¬∞ of anhedral. The outer panels also thinned outwards from the 9.5% thickness-to-chord ratio of the inner panels. Ahead of the forward spar the wing was plywood-covered, with the rest fabric covered. Each half-wing was wire braced with a pair of lift wires from the fuselage underside to the inner-outer wing panel junction. On the Gy√∂rgy I a single landing wire reached over the cockpit between these junctions. This arrangement led to concerns about safety, so on the Gy√∂rgy II there was a central steel cabane strut from which landing wires ran out and rearwards to the rear of the junctions. Short, broad ailerons reached to the tips. Because their hinges were unswept, the sweep of the trailing edges produced triangular plan surfaces, broadest at the tips. In addition to the revised bracing, the wingspan of the Gy√∂rgy II was reduced from the of the Gy√∂rgy I to by the removal of two ribs from each of the outer panels. The Gy√∂rgy I's ply covered fuselage, built around circular frames,was deepest under the wing and tapered rearwards. In the Gy√∂rgy I, the pilot had an open cockpit at mid-chord but this was moved forward of the leading edge on the Gy√∂rgy II. A rubber-sprung landing skid ran from the nose to under the wing at mid-chord. Though the empennage changes made between the Gy√∂rgy I and II are not well documented, they had similar vertical surfaces, with a small, triangular fin and a full, rounded rudder. The tailplane of both models was mounted on top of the fuselage but differed in plan. The Gy√∂rgy I's was triangular but on the Gy√∂rgy II the leading edge was straight. Both carried strongly swept elevators, though shortened on the Gyuri II. Variants ;Szent Gy√∂rgy I: First flown spring 1933. ;Szent Gy√∂rgy II: First flown 3 September 1933.

Early life  He was the son of Domingo Coromines i Frexanet and Maria Montanya i Mercader. He earned a degree in Law at the University of Barcelona in 1894. During his youth, he kept contacts with Catalanist, Republican, Modernista, and even anarchist groups, due to his work at the magazine L‚ÄôAven√ß starting in 1895. He also kept contacts with anarchist groups through the cultural group Foc Nou, which he founded with Jaume Brossa i Roger, Alexandre Cortada i Serra, and Ignasi Igl√©sias Pujadas. He joined Nicolas Salmer√≥n‚Äôs Republican Union Party. His contact with anarchists drew the suspicions of the Spanish authorities. After the 1896 bombing of the Corpus Christi procession on the Carrer de Canvis Nous, he was arrested and tried in the Montju√Øc Trial, where he faced the death penalty. In the end he was sentenced to 8 years in prison. In 1897, he was sent into exile in France by the Spanish authorities, which lasted until he was given amnesty by the Sagasta government in 1901. Shortly after, he earned his doctorate in law and studied economics at University of Madrid. He took advantage of this stay to start a campaign to revise the sentences for the Montju√Øc defendants, which was supported by well-known figures such as Miguel de Unamuno and Federico Urales.  Career  In 1903 he returned to Barcelona to serve in the financial department of the City Council of Barcelona. In 1907 he wrote Memoria y proyecto de contrato con el Banco Hispano Colonial with mayor Idelfons Sunyol. He was a founding member of the Institut d‚ÄôEstudis Catalans on June 18, 1907 in the History and Arqueology section, and later in 1911 in the Science section. In 1901 he was named president of the Republican Nationalist Federal Union and became director of El Poble Catal√†. He was elected to the City Council of Barcelona in 1909 and in 1910 and 1914 he became a member at the Spanish parliament. In 1914 he inspired the Sant Gervasi pact between RNFU and Lerroux's Radical Republican Party. Because of this failure he left active politics for a long period. In 1916 he started working as a lawyer and held conferences in Madrid. He also worked as a secretary for the Bank of Catalonia. He dedicated his efforts to literature during Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, and collaborated with publications including La Humanitat and Revista de Catalunya. He served as president of the Ateneu Barcelon√®s from 1928 to 1930. He returned to politics with the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic. Due to his legal and political experience and prestige, Francesc Maci√† added him to the drafting commission of the Estatut de N√∫ria, and in 1933 he appointed him counselor of Justice and Law. He was elected member of parliament for Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (within the Front d‚ÄôEsquerres) in the general elections of 1936, and served as General Museum Commissioner of the Generalitat de Catalunya during the Spanish civil war. At the end of the war, he migrated to Buenos Aires with his family, where he died shortly after.

It provides a continuous daily feed of news stories about state-government issues and events, supplemented by photos, audio and video. It is also the only news outlet with floor privileges in the Massachusetts House and Senate chambers, where SHNS reporters cover every session from desks near the rostrums. The SHNS is a subscription-only, paywalled service with limited advertising. Clients include media outlets, government agencies, lobbyists and lobbying firms, political campaigns, advocacy organizations and non-profits, and corporations. The Service produces news stories, daily schedules of state house events, gavel-to-gavel coverage of the House and Senate, and weekly summaries of the week's top stories and of the events and issues likely to be making news in the weeks ahead. Its office is in Room 458 of the Massachusetts State House.  History  The SHNS was founded in 1894 by Charles E. Mann of Lynn, Massachusetts, a self-educated reporter who began covering the State House beat in 1889 for the Boston Advertiser and Boston Record. It was not unheard of for reporters to cover the beat for more than one paper, nor to form their own small news services. Then as now, Mann's bureau afforded out-of-town papers the opportunity to print firsthand accounts of legislative business and track issues of importance to their communities. Mann added papers and reporters over time, and also worked part-time for state government itself, as a clerk on a special commission redrafting the state's statutes. In 1903, he took a full-time job with the government, as clerk of the state Railroad Commission which later became the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, and turned the business over to Charles H. Copeland. Copeland's family made headlines in 1912 when his brother-in-law, famous novelist Jacques Futrelle died aboard the RMS Titanic. The Service has operated continuously since its founding, passing through a succession of six owners to the present day, with the basic product remaining constant: daily news copy covering state government affairs. = Early Leadership = Copeland died in 1913 and his wife Elberta inherited the business. The Copelands had made news themselves, across the east coast, with their high-profile elopement in 1893. As manager/owner, Elberta spent the first seven years of her career disenfranchised from the government she covered daily; women did not receive the right to vote in Massachusetts until 1920. But Elberta insisted on her rights, becoming the first woman allowed onto the floor of the Massachusetts House Chamber. At the time of her death in 1951, she was also the only woman life member of the Massachusetts State House Press Association. In time, she took a more passive role in actual news coverage, hiring a succession of editors and at the end of her long career \\"she just sat in the corner, proud to own the News Service,\\" her great- grandnephew recalled. Copeland received a formal expression of concern in 1943 from Gov. Leverett Saltonstall about a serious accident, the nature of which was not specified. In 1947, she formally turned over ownership of the New Service to Paul Ryan, her longtime reporter and editor. Ryan became a legend in the political and journalistic life of the State House, holding court at his corner desk as politicians and would-be influencers came and went to share news tips and gossip about the issues of the day. He served as editor from 1942 until 1947, and owner/editor until 1979 when ill health forced his retirement. Under Ryan, the News Service continued its non-sensational approach to coverage, though the reporters it employed had their quirks. Veteran Boston political reporter Peter Lucas remembered that Ryan tended to hire \\"unemployed reporters who were down and out with temporary jobs\\" in addition to the regular line reporters. Ryan was in competition with the New England News Service, a similar wire service with a stronger emphasis on feature stories, established in the late 1930s by Arthur Woodman. Woodman's daughter Helen worked for her father's service, beginning her career after graduating from the University of New Hampshire in 1964. In 1978, with his health declining, Ryan asked Woodman to take over the News Service and she accepted. But immediately upon assuming the editorship, Woodman faced a crisis. = Dual-Employment Controversy = It was common in the early years of the 20th century for reporters to work side jobs doing research and writing news releases for government agencies and legislative commissions, and News Service reporters did lots this sort of work into well into the 1970s. The appearance of State House reporters on the payrolls of government organizations made headlines from time to time from mid-century onward, and in 1978, just as Ryan's health was seriously declining, rival wire-service Associated Press published a story revealing that Ryan himself held contracts to do government work. Encouraged by the News Service's competitors to cancel their subscriptions, a number of subscribers did just that, and Woodman had to deal with a crisis of both finances and reputation. But throughout the 1980s, she and her staff slowly won the departed subscribers back, and she made sure the wall between the News Service and the state payroll stayed up for good. Former SHNS reporter Lisa Capone, in a memorial interview after Woodman's death, said her former boss \\"ushered us through the initiation of what journalism really was.\\" Woodman earned a legendary status at the State House in her own right, training generations of reporters who went on to top positions in journalism, government and public affairs in Massachusetts. \\"There was nothing Helen didn't know about in the Massachusetts governing process,\\" according to a 2017 WBUR-FM remembrance of Woodman's life. \\"She spoke 'State House' fluently. News outlets, lobbyists and trade organizations relied on her reporters ‚Äî the Kids ‚Äî who would type their articles on carbon paper and stuff them into cubbyhole mailboxes for clients to use in their own publications.\\" = Current Ownership = By 1996, Woodman felt she had run the News Service long enough and wished to retire, but wanted to turn the business over to someone who would uphold its integrity and news ethos. She found that person in Craig Sandler, who'd worked for Woodman from 1988-1991. Sandler had gone on to work as state government reporter for the TAB Newspapers, a chain of free weeklies in the Metrowest suburbs of Boston. The TABs were known for an unusually high quality level of coverage for free shoppers, with robust arts coverage and elements like the presence of a full-time report reporter at the State House. The chain was founded and run by Russel Pergament and Stephen Cummings. Helen Woodman with Craig Sandler on her left and SHNS reporters Jon Tapper and Dan Boylan in August 1996. After the TAB, Sandler worked for The Sun of Lowell, and while he was there, Woodman told him of her interest in selling. Sandler reached out to Pergament and Cummings, and the trio acquired the News Service on Aug. 5, 1996. They have owned it ever since. Just as Elberta Copeland had selected Daniel O'Connor and others to serve as editor after doing the job for several years herself, in 1998, Sandler hired Michael P. Norton, who trained alongside Sandler under Helen Woodman, for the editor's job. Only Paul Ryan has held the editor's job longer. = Location, Distribution and Technology = The News Service has always had offices on the fourth floor of the Massachusetts State House. The first location information, from 1906, puts the service in Room 449, farther toward the back of the building than the current room, 458. In 1947, when Thomas \\"Tip\\" O'Neill became the first Massachusetts House minority leader assigned an office, he took over 449, and the News Service was assigned Room 458, where it's been ever since. In the beginning, copy was written out in longhand or typewritten, and early recollections of the service include reference to the mimeographing of copy - a cheap, fast, reliable method that was available from the founding of SHNS. The \\"flimsies,\\" or copies, were picked up by hand by subscribers in the building, and also rushed by messenger boys down to the newsrooms on Newspaper Row in Boston - near modern-day Downtown Crossing. The mimeograph remained in use until the end of 1993. Paper copies were placed in boxes at the front of Room 458 from the time it moved well into the era of email. The full spectrum of players in state government would visit Room 458, to pick up the latest news and press releases. By 1997, it was clear the service needed a digital presence, and its new owners established the email servers, Web site and back- end content preparation system necessary to get the copy out to subscribers over the Internet. The coming of digital also made possible the transmission of photos for the first time in service history, and they became a standard feature at the end of the '90s. Audio and video followed. The digital archives of the service run back to 1986, and paper archives run back to the 1970s. = Reach and Impact = Pergament and Cummings were experienced salespeople, and they expanded the subscriber base considerably. At the same time, the Internet was proving a bane to traditional journalism, but a boon to the News Service. The business model of ad-based news outlets deteriorated alarmingly after 1999, with advertisers preferring the customizable intimacy and market intelligence available on platforms like Facebook and Google, and that led to staffing reductions industry-wide that have continued to this day. State House bureaus were downsized, then eliminated, by most Massachusetts regional newspapers. Consolidation of newspaper holding groups became the norm, followed by acquisition of these groups by finance-focused hedge and venture funds who prime focus was on the robustness of investor return more than the vitality of civic life or ensuring a well-informed citizenry. Denuded of government reporters, the news outlets increasingly relied on News Service copy for State House coverage that once had been provided by staff members. \\"The State House News Service is one news operation that has benefited from news cutbacks,\\" according to a 2011 CommonWealth Magazine story. \\"It used to be a backstop for most news organizations, essentially a transcription service keeping track of hearings, press conferences, and legislative sessions. But as the reporting ranks dwindled on Beacon Hill, the News Service has become a major supplier of State House stories to newspapers and media outlets across the state.\\" SHNS articles, photos, and audio-visual content are utilized by both daily newspapers and all major broadcast stations in Boston. While hard statistics are difficult to gather authoritatively, it is likely that more people read News Service copy today statewide than at any time in the Service's 125-plus years of existence. = News Service Florida = By the mid 2000s, the new digital paywall model for the News Service had been validated, and Sandler began visiting other state capitols to see if the model could be replicated. Florida had the lucrative market, thriving government-affairs sector and complicated politics that would support a large enough staff and infrastructure to run a full-fledged capitol bureau, so Sandler selected Tallahassee. The business model, operating structure, product offering and customer base are very similar to those of the State House News Service.  Role in the Massachusetts State House  Location of the State House News Service reporter's desk on the floor of the House Chamber The News Service serves most immediately as a \\"cheat sheet\\" for reporters assigned to the State House itself, to fill them in on stories they can't cover directly because they are working on other stories or assignments. This \\"cheat sheet\\" function has diminished in importance as the number of State House reporters, and the ranks of journalists assigned to cover government, has diminished significantly in recent years. At the same time, this phenomenon has increased the value of the Service in newsrooms across Massachusetts (and Florida, in the case of NSF). News organizations use SHNS stories in place of pieces that once would have been written by State House reporters (Capitol reporters in Florida). The News Service operates as a wire service of record for the building as the only outlet granted floor privileges in the House and Senate chambers, in contrast to other news organizations that report from the galleries. The SHNS floor desks are located near the rostrums of both chambers. In 1970, a short item in the Boston Herald described SHNS reporter Fred Day being \\"hit by flying pieces of a gavel thumped vigorously by House Speaker Bartley, whose stand is fully 10 feet away\\" -- for the second time in 10 days. Beyond the journalism community, the News Service serves as a de facto news source of record for the wider state-government community - the legislators, legislative staffers, agency employees, political organizations and industry groups, and the like.

V (Swabian Jura Association) (SAV) is one of the oldest hiking clubs in Germany. Based in Stuttgart, the society was founded on August 13, 1888 in Plochingen, Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Its territory extends far beyond the Swabian Jura north to the Tauber river and south to the Lake Constance, including the former territory of W√ºrttemberg except for the part of the Black Forest previously part of W√ºrttemberg (Calw and Freudenstadt). It is enrolled in the register of associations of the district court of Stuttgart (VR 2430). The number of members grew rapidly, from 519 in 1889 to about 20,000 in 1897, 44,000 in 1926, 60,000 in 1955, and 100,000 in 1971. Today it is the largest German and European hiking club. The association is a member of the German Hiking Association (Deutscher Wanderverband) and of the European Ramblers' Association. Since 1994, the group is a recognized conservation association. History Valentin Salzmann memorial in Esslingen am Neckar On August 13, 1888, at the invitation of Valentin Salzmann, the representatives of several beautification associations met in Plochingen with the aim of improving the work of the existing groups on the Albtrauf. At the inaugural meeting on November 12, 1888 in Plochingen Salzmann presented the first draft of the by-laws of the Albverein, which was inaugurated shortly thereafter. The first committee meeting took place on April 22, 1889. At the first general meeting of the Association on May 5, 1889 Salzmann was unanimously elected chairman, Ernst Camerer secretary and deputy chairman, Gustav Str√∂hmfeld treasurer, and Eugen N√§gele editor. Structure The association is divided into 22 \\"districts\\" (Gaue). They are responsible for overseeing the local groups in their area. At present the association has 570 local groups. The main office is located in Stuttgart. Goals The association is not only dedicated to hiking, but above all to regional culture and all its riches. Its goal is to cultivate and preserve both the special and the everyday within its territory from the Taubergrund to Lake Constance and from the Black Forest to the N√∂rdlinger Ries. These include the protection of nature and landscape as well as the care of language, music, dance and song. This results in rich hiking and events programs and many opportunities for recreation, relaxation and socializing. An important goal is also the training of qualified hiking guides. For this purpose, the homeland and hiking academy Baden-W√ºrttemberg was founded in 2001. It is a joint project of the Swabian Albverein together with the Black Forest Association . Offerings With their extensive hiking and events programs the local groups offer many opportunities for recreation, relaxation and socializing. Being a member of the Swabian Albverein does not just mean joining in a group with a trained hiking guide who knows how to tell about the ways, nature and culture, landscape history and buildings. In addition, the numerous hikes, annual meetings and hikes under the stars provide an opportunity for sociable walking and celebrating together. In addition, the Association offers training for expert hiking guides, conservationists or youth workers, lessons in folk music, folk dancing, flag waving and more.

Reilly FRCP is an Irish neurologist who works at National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. She studies peripheral neuropathy. She is the President of the Association of British Neurologists.  Early life and education  Reilly studied medicine at University College Dublin, graduating in 1986. She worked for a few years as a neurologist at St. Vincent's University Hospital, before joining Anita Harding at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in 1991. Reilly has spoken of how much she admired her supervisor, and attributes her clinical interests to Harding. Reilly earned her medical doctorate in 1996, focussing on familial amyloid polyneuropathy. She completed her neurological training at Royal Free Hospital and Guy's Hospital, training with P. K. Thomas and Richard Hughes.  Career  At the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery Reilly specialises in inherited neuropathies. She was made consultant neurologist in 1998 and a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 2002. She began to study neuromuscular disease, in particular Charcot‚ÄìMarie‚ÄìTooth disease. In 2004, she found that Vitamin C could be used to improve symptoms in mouse models of CMT1A (Charcot‚ÄìMarie‚ÄìTooth disease type 1A). She established a randomized controlled trial with colleagues in Italy to evaluate the efficacy of Vitamin C on CMT1A. The UK part of the trial consisted of 50 participants, and found that whilst Vitamin C is safe, it does not slow the progression of the disease. Although the trial was not a success, it developed new neuropathy outcome measures. Her research includes the identification of genes such as BICD2 and methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MARS); she has already conducted functional analysis of IGHMBP2. Reilly works with Muscular Dystrophy UK on muscle-wasting conditions. She has also worked on new biomarkers for disease progression. CMT parents suffer from damaged motor nerves, which results in muscles weakening, and ultimately allows fat to accumulate in muscles; MRI outcome measures could monitor intramuscular fat accumulation, and detect muscle water changes that preceded fat accumulation.. Reilly identified that calf muscle fat friction maps are an outcome measure in patients with CMT1A, with calf muscle fat increased significantly in patients with CMT1A She received a $1,000,000 grant from the Muscular Dystrophy Association to evaluate MRI protocols for monitoring changes in muscles from CMT. In 2010 Reilly was appointed Professor of Clinical Neurology at University College London. She leads the Division of Clinical Neurology and Medical Research Council Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases. With the MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases and Muscular Dystrophy UK, Reilly runs an annual translational neuromuscular diseases meeting, which includes a patient day to discuss inherited neuropathies. Along with CMT, Reilly has worked on hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies and carpal tunnel syndrome in inherited neuropathies. Reilly contributed to the 2013 Handbook of Clinical Neurology, and wrote a chapter for the 2016 Springer Publishing collection Neuromuscular Disease: Case Studies from Queen Square. Reilly has served as President of the British Peripheral Nerve Society and the International Peripheral Nerve Society. In 2015 she was appointed President-elect of the Association of British Neurologists. She became the first woman to take the role in 2017.

Retrieved January 16, 2019. Plot The film begins with Lincoln (Frank McGlynn Sr.) delivering part of his presidential inaugural speech in Washington, D.C, on March 4, 1861. The next scene, six weeks later, is in the White House, where the president is talking with his wife Mary (Nana Bryant). Suddenly their young son Tad (Dickie Moore) and Lincoln's assistant John Hay (John Harron) rush in to report that Confederate forces had bombarded Fort Sumter in South Carolina. The president, saddened by the news, kneels with Tad to pray for the nation. The story moves to December 1862, with Lincoln discussing the importance of the Emancipation Proclamation prior to its release. That scene transitions to July 1863, to Lincoln's cabinet members bickering about the president's war strategy, when news arrives of the Union army's victory at Gettysburg. As the men celebrate, Lincoln comes in to defend again his policies. Later in the White House, the president plays with Tad on the floor before meeting with a Mrs. Scott (Sibyl Harris). She is there to plead for the life of her son, a young soldier who is to be executed for falling asleep while on sentry duty with the Wisconsin infantry at Gettysburg. Lincoln's secretary of war, Edwin Stanton (Raymond Brown), now enters and threatens to resign if the soldier is pardoned. Lincoln calms Stanton and then assures Mrs. Scott he will pardon her son. The film now advances to November 1863. Tad is seriously ill, and his father, mother, and the attending doctor (Edward LeSaint) worry at his bedside. The president fears for his son‚Äôs life, but he must depart for Gettysburg to take part in the dedication of the battlefield cemetery there. Once at the town, Lincoln stays in the home of attorney David Wills (Earl Dwire). That evening, while editing his speech for the dedication, the president instructs the army band outside to play \\"Dixie\\", a song deeply associated with the American South. A crowd in the street initially objects to the choice but begins cheering when the band performs what Lincoln calls a \\"mighty fine tune\\".Dialogue and document content transcribed from film. The next day at the ceremony, as celebrated orator Edward Everett (Gordon Hart) concludes his two-hour speech, Lincoln receives a telegram from Mary informing him that Tad is \\"much improved\\", news that noticeably relieves the president. He now stands and delivers his own speech, which lasts less than three minutes. At the end of his brief but historic address, the image of Lincoln's face fades out, gradually replaced by an American flag fluttering in the wind and accompanied musically by a rousing excerpt from the \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic\\".

Retrieved January 18, 2019. Filming the color short was essentially divided into two distinct parts: Wilfrid M. Cline served as chief cinematographer and Natalie Kalmus served as director of Technicolor, a color process that required special patented cameras that studios had to rent from the Technicolor Company.King, Susan (1998). \\"The Rise of Technicolor Is Colorful Hollywood History\\", archives of the Los Angeles Times, December 4, 1998. Retrieved January 18, 2019. Those rentals also required that a representative from the company's \\"Advisory Service\\" be on site to oversee every production's color \\"palette\\". Kalmus was the company's representative on Lincoln in the White House. By 1939, the Technicolor process had improved substantially in quality since its first commercial use in Hollywood productions 17 years earlier; nevertheless, filming with the required cameras still demanded numerous and precise adjustments to lighting and careful color selections of set content in order to attain reasonably accurate and visually appealing reproductions of colors on a film's final print. Kalmus therefore worked closely with Milo Anderson in selecting costumes and with Charles Novi, the short's art director, in choosing rugs, curtains, upholsteries, and other set furnishings deemed acceptable to her in both color and tone.

ClimateWorks Foundation's mission is to slow global warming by funding other organizations internationally to help find best practice solutions to cut down on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions . In 2016 the nonprofit was listed as one of the Top 100 Largest U.S. Charities by Forbes Magazine.  History  ClimateWorks Foundation was conceptualized and founded by Hal Harvey for a 2007 ‚ÄúDesign to Win‚Äù report financed by the Hewlett Foundation and other foundations to examine how philanthropists can fight against global warming. Hal Harvey's plan behind ClimateWorks Foundation is a sketched \\"Sudoku\\" plan divided into 5 economic sectors: Power, Industry, Buildings, Transport, & Forest. The plan is meant to address emissions of the world's 6 heaviest CO2 consuming regions; such as: the United States, China, India, Europe, and Latin America. The study outlines the zones that produce the most carbon emissions in the planet and systematically approaches the ‚Äú30 by 30‚Äù goal of reducing 30 gigatons of annual heat emissions by the year 2030. Each square from the \\"Sudoku\\" plan depicts how many gigatons of carbon could be saved by nation. Dubbed the ‚ÄúClimateWorks Sudoku‚Äù, the Foundation uses this plan in their annual reports and in 2011, reported that China had the potential to save 9.6 gigatons by 2030, while the United States had the potential to save 3.6 gigatons. Hal Harvey left ClimateWorks Foundation in December, 2011. Harvey is now serving as the new CEO of Energy Innovation and is also a published author of Designing Climate Solutions: A Policy Guide for Low-Carbon Energy. He was succeeded by Julie Blunden as the foundation's new Chief Executive Officer, President, and Director of ClimateWorks on May 21, 2012. Ms. Blunden has 25 years of experience in the energy industry and is a well known energy policy expert with a background in both the industrial and non-profit sectors. The ClimateWorks foundation has hosted a discussion on \\"accelerating global climate action\\", in 2018 at Climate Week NYC.  Efforts  Efforts by the ClimateWorks Foundation to yield global warming includes sending scientists and experts in energy issues to manufacturing industries by delivering critical awareness and setting reachable goals to lessen carbon dioxide emissions from top nations that produce them. ClimateWorks Foundation has contributed funding to the China Sustainable Energy Program in an effort to stop cement factories from upgrading to larger CO2 emission factories. They also advise factory managers on how to cut down on CO2 emissions through better practices. ClimateWorks Foundation has also designed techniques to halt global warming for industries such as: construction, manufacturing, transportation, & forest. ClimateWorks Foundation also has a global network of experts and scientists that provide planning and technological concepts to focus on carbon emission in major economic nations by supplying best practices for vehicle emission standards, building codes, & energy efficiency. The foundation also designs eco-friendly houses and awards grants to regional foundations to recognize their resolutions.  Partnerships and Donors  The ClimateWorks Foundation has been partnered with other organizations, through single time donations and continued sponsorship. For example, the Oak foundation has funded the ClimateWorks foundation with $75 million for the development of \\"responsible global and local governance mechanisms, which will have important ramifications socially as well as environmentally.\\" ClimateWorks has been founded mainly by the Hewlett & Packard Foundation and the McKnight Foundation located in Minnesota. ClimateWorks has provided funding to Greenpeace India; alongside with funding from Greenpeace international, ClimateWorks grants composed about 30% of the organization's funding in June 2015. The foundation also funded around $170 million to the Energy Foundation and $1,520,000 to Green tech.

Fortune is best known for his support of paved city and state roads as part of the Good Roads Movement and leading a thirty-year effort to elevate railroad tracks in Indianapolis, in addition to leadership in several civic organizations. In 1890 he helped establish the Commercial Club, the forerunner to the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce; in 1916 he was a founder of the Indianapolis chapter of the American Red Cross; and in 1918 he led a local War Chest fundraising effort, which was a forerunner to the city's present-day United Way campaigns. In 1920 Fortune purchased the home where Hoosier poet James Whitcomb Riley once lived in Indianapolis in order to preserve it. Fortune retained the property, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, until the nonprofit James Whitcomb Riley Memorial Association was formed in 1922. Fortune also acquired and donated a site in Indianapolis in 1930 for a U.S. Veterans Health Administration hospital that was completed in 1931. Fortune began his career in Indianapolis in 1882 as a newspaper reporter for the Indianapolis Journal (1882‚Äì88), worked briefly for the weekly Sunday Press (1888), and spent two years as a reporter and editorial writer for the Indianapolis News (1889‚Äì91). Fortune published Paving and Municipal Engineering (renamed Municipal Engineering in 1896), a paving industry trade magazine, from 1890 to 1911. Other business interests include serving as president (1910‚Äì24) of a group of independent telephone companies that later became part of Indiana Bell. Fortune was also member of the Eli Lilly and Company board of directors (1913‚Äì27). Fortune was an active promoter for the City of Indianapolis. He served as the Indianapolis Commercial Club's vice president (1894) and president (1897), as well as the first president of the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce (1917). Fortune helped plan the construction of the Commercial Club's eight-story building, Indianapolis's first \\"skyscraper,\\" which opened in 1893, the same year he served as executive director of the twenty-seventh encampment of the Grand Army of the Republic, the city's first major convention. Fortune was also the first president of the Indianapolis Automobile Club (1904‚Äì06) and the first president of the Indianapolis chapter of the American Red Cross (1916‚Äì42). In his later years, he was active at the national level in the Chamber of Commerce and the American Red Cross. He died in Indianapolis, Indiana, and is buried at Crown Hill Cemetery, Indianapolis. Early life and education William \\"Will\\" Fortune was born on May 27, 1863, in Boonville, Warrick County, Indiana, the oldest of Mary (St. Clair) and William Harrison Fortune's five children. William Harrison Fortune served as a corporal in the 1st Indiana Cavalry Regiment during the American Civil War and found work as a blacksmith and watchmaker after mustering out of the military, but he frequently suffered from ill health. The family also moved often. Mary and William Harrison Fortune divorced in 1877. After the divorce, Mary Fortune supported herself and her three surviving children by running a boardinghouse in Boonville and William Harrison Fortune had little to no further contact with his children and former wife. During his youth, Will Fortune was largely self-taught through reading and work experiences. He received only a basic education before beginning an apprenticeship at the Boonville Standard at the age of thirteen. Fortune also developed an early interest in writing and interviewing people. At the age of seventeen, he wrote a history of Warrick County, Indiana, which was published in 1881. Fortune began a lifelong interest in studying the life of Abraham Lincoln while still a teenager. In late 1881 he joined General James C. Veatch in conducting interviews and taking notes of conversations with several people in nearby Spencer County, Indiana, who had known Lincoln during his youth.Latham, pp. 3, 8‚Äì9, and 137‚Äì40.

Civic leader and philanthropist For more than five decades Fortune was an active promoter for the city of Indianapolis, where he was involved in civic affairs and philanthropic organizations, including several that he helped establish. In 1890 Fortuned collaborated with Colonel Eli Lilly to found the Commercial Club, the forerunner to the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce, which was established in 1911.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 345. Fortune received a salary as the club's secretary until 1894, when Colonel Lilly was president of the organization. In addition to other activities with the Commercial Club, Fortune was involved in planning construction of its new eight-story building, the city's first \\"skyscraper,\\" which opened in 1893.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., pp. 594‚Äì95. See also: Latham, pp. 43‚Äì46. Beginning in the early 1890s Fortune was active in the Commercial Club's efforts to increase and improve the pavement of Indianapolis's streets, including the organization of a national paving exposition in Indianapolis in 1890 to emphasize the need for municipal street improvements. Fortune became the Commercial Club's vice president in 1894 and served as its president in 1897. When the Commercial Club reorganized Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce in 1917, Fortune was elected the Chamber's first president.Latham, pp. 39‚Äì41, 57, and 120. Fortune also collaborated with Colonel Lilly and other members of the Commercial Club to secure Indianapolis's selection as the site for the twenty-seventh encampment of the Grand Army of the Republic in 1893, the city's first major convention. Fortune served as executive director of the encampment, which attracted an estimated 100,000 veterans to Indianapolis.After conclusion of the encampment, a controversy developed over the distribution of more than $15,000 of surplus funds not spent on the encampment that resulted in a lawsuit filed against the Commercial Club, Fortune, and Lilly; however, the Indiana Supreme Court ruled in their favor in 1899. See Latham, pp. 51‚Äì57. During the economic depression of 1893‚Äì94 Fortune supported the Commercial Club's program to aid workers and helping 2,000 local families through the winter months. In 1904 Fortune was one of the guides when the Commercial Club hosted a visit to Indiana for China's Prince Pu Lun. Although Fortune never learned to drive, he was an avid automobile enthusiast. In the early 1890s, Fortune founded an automobile club in Indianapolis and advocated for improved roads in the state as part of the Good Roads Movement. He also served as the first president of the Indianapolis Automobile Club from 1904 to 1906. In addition, Fortune led the Commercial Club's thirty-year effort to elevate the railroad tracks to improve street and railroad traffic flow in the city. Fortune served as chair of the Commercial Club's Elevated Railroad Commission from 1898 until 1916. Opponents of the project sometimes called the effort \\"Fortune's Folly,\\" but the work continued until it was finally completed in 1921.Latham, pp. 79, and 87‚Äì93. Following the death in 1916 of his friend, Hoosier poet James Whitcomb Riley, Fortune lead efforts to preserve the Lockerbie Street home where Riley once lived in Indianapolis.

He was especially active in fundraising efforts and organizing local volunteers. Fortune helped organize disaster relief for tornado victims in Indiana and led efforts to equip a base hospital prior to its relocation in France during World War I. In addition, he organized local efforts to produce supplies for the soldiers. Fortune's other wartime efforts included organizing and leading a local War Chest drive in 1918 that raised more than $500,000 in a single week. This community fundraiser was a forerunner to the local United Way campaigns.Latham, pp. 111‚Äì19 and 122. Other interests In addition to his varied business and philanthropic interests, Fortune was a world traveler. In January 1923 Fortune and his friend, J. K. Lilly Sr., the president and board chairman of Eli Lilly and Company, were among the 350 passengers who embarked on the first around-the-world cruise of Cunard Line's RMS Samaria, which returned to New York City on May 31, 1923. Fortune and the ship‚Äôs other passengers called at ports in Portugal, Gibraltar, Algeria, Italy, Egypt, India, Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka), Sumatra, Java, Singapore, the Philippines, Korea, and Japan, as well as cities such as Hong Kong, Honolulu, and San Francisco. The ship also traveled through the Panama Canal. One memorable land excursion included a train trip from Calcutta, India, to Rangoon, Burma (present-day Yangon, Myanmar).Fortune's detailed journal of his experiences and descriptions of these ports of call as they appeared in 1923 are included in the Fortune Collection at the Indiana Historical Society. See Latham, pp. 125‚Äì34, and Madison, p. 74. Later years During the 1920 and the 1930s, Fortune continued to participate in several philanthropic projects at the local and national levels. In 1927 Fortune was appointed chair of the George Rogers Clark Sesquicentennial Commission. Although he led the commission's initial efforts to erect a George Rogers Clark memorial, Fortune resigned in 1928 following disagreements with other committee members. The project was completed in 1935.

While most of his efforts proved to be successful, not all of them were. Fortune was impatient and not afraid to disagree with those who did not share his goals or vision for a particular project. For example, conflicts over goals and priorities lead to his resignation as chairman of the George Rogers Clark Sesquicentennial Commission in 1928 and as president of American Peace Society in 1930.Latham, pp. 151‚Äì55, and 159.

NewsGuard is a browser extension created by NewsGuard Technologies. It labels news sources with either a green or red icon, indicating its general trustworthiness and whether it has a history of running stories labeled as fake news. Supported browsers include Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, and Safari. It is included by default in the mobile version of Edge, though users must enable it.  Background  NewsGuard Technologies was founded in 2018 by Steven Brill and L. Gordon Crovitz, who serve as co-CEOs. Investors include the Knight Foundation and Publicis. The NewsGuard extension is installed in browsers and warns users when they view content from what it considers fake news websites. Journalists employed by NewsGuard Technologies score news sites on their reliability and general trustworthiness. The analysis is designed to be transparent and includes the name of the staffer who analyzed the site. Sites that score at least 60 out of 100 points based on nine criteria display a green icon next to their name, and ones that score lower get a red. Users can optionally read more information, including how the sites fared in each criterion. The extension can also highlight potential conflicts of interest, such as websites that do not disclose that they are financed by lobbying groups. NewsGuard determines a website's overall credibility score based on a number of criteria. These include: * The frequency of publication of inaccurate information * The extent of sourcing and original reporting of information * The degree of demarcation between news and opinion journalism * The accuracy of headlines, including the use of clickbait headlines * The degree of disclosure of the website's ownership, as well as the political positions of the owners Brill positions the extension as an alternative to government regulation and automated algorithms, such as those used by Facebook. For revenue, NewsGuard Technologies licenses their ratings. Clients include technology companies and the advertising industry, who view the ratings as a way to protect clients against advertising on sites that could harm their brand. In January 2019, the extension was integrated into the mobile version of Microsoft Edge, though users must enable it. Sites that had previously ignored the extension, such as MailOnline, objected to being listed as unreliable. The decision to list MailOnline as unreliable was reversed, and NewsGuard admitted they were wrong on some counts. Sites labeled as unreliable include InfoWars, the Daily Kos, Sputnik, RT, and WikiLeaks. NewsGuard has been criticized by Breitbart News as \\"the establishment media's latest effort to blacklist alternative media sites\\". NewsGuard attempts to work with sites they label as unreliable to advise them on how to come into compliance with their criteria. As of January 2019, Brill says the extension includes ratings for the 2000 most popular American news sites. Ratings for more British sites are expected in April 2019. NewsGuard expanded its coverage to news in European languages such as French and German ahead of the 2019 European Parliament election. In April 2019, the co-founders of NewsGuard announced that they had entered talks with British internet service providers to incorporate their credibility scoring system into consumer internet packages. Under the plans, a user would see a warning message before visiting a misleading site without needing to have the NewsGuard extension installed. Users would also have the ability to disable the feature. In January 2020, NewsGuard began notifying users that it would become a paid, member-supported browser extension in early 2020, while remaining free for libraries and schools. Early adopters would get a 33% discount on the price, paying $1.95/month (USD) or ¬£1.95/month (UK). They plan to roll out new premium features, including a reliability score, and offer new mobile apps for Android and iOS.

It succeeds the Ebbe Nielsen Prize, which was awarded annually by GBIF between 2002 and 2014. The name of the challenge honours the memory of prominent entomologist and biodiversity informatics proponent Ebbe Nielsen, who died of a heart attack in the U.S.A. en route to the 2001 GBIF Governing Board meeting. History In 2001, GBIF created the Ebbe Nielsen Prize to honour the recently deceased Danish-Australian entomologist Ebbe Nielsen, who was a keen proponent of both GBIF and the biodiversity informatics discipline. That prize recognized a global researcher or research team for their retrospective contribution(s) to the field of biodiversity informatics, according to criteria set out by GBIF in the terms of the award. From 2015 onwards, GBIF re-launched the award process as a competition between global individuals or teams of researchers to create new software or approaches to using biodiversity data according to a theme announced annually for each round of the competition, and also to split the prize money among multiple groups instead of a single winner as in the initial era of the Prize.

It also provides access to the isolated Casamance province from the rest of Senegal. A bridge had been proposed for this location in 1956 but political considerations delayed construction which finally began in 2015. Construction was funded largely by a loan of US$ 65 million from the African Development Bank, with remaining funding coming from the Gambian government. Construction works were carried out by a joint venture of Spanish company Isolux Cors√°n and the Senegalese Arezki Group. The bridge, made from reinforced concrete, opened to light vehicles on 21 January 2019. At in length it is one of West Africa's longest bridges and includes a central span to facilitate continued use of the river by boats. The Senegambia bridge forms part of the Trans-Gambia Highway and the Trans‚ÄìWest African Coastal Highway.  Situation  The bridge lies approximately south of Farafenni, a Gambian town on the border with Senegal, and carries the Trans-Gambia Highway across the Gambia River. This runs east-west through The Gambia and splits the country in two. The river also prevents easy movement of people from the main portion of Senegal, which lies north of The Gambia, to its southern province of Casamance which is south of the river. Travellers had previously used a ferry crossing at this location, but it was unreliable and delays of 10‚Äì20 days waiting for a ferry were not uncommon. The alternative was a detour eastwards to the next available crossing of the Gambia River. Development in Casamance had been hindered by the poor access to the rest of the country.  Planning  The bridge was first mooted in 1956 and the French government committed funds for its construction in 1971 but the start of works was delayed by periods of strained tensions between Gambia and Senegal. The project was formerly led by the Organisation pour la Mise en Valeur du Fleuve Gambie (OMVG) which commissioned engineering feasibility studies of the scheme from French firm BCEOM and Tunisian firm SCET Tunisie in the 1990s. These studies were updated by the same companies between 2007 and 2009 and form the basis of the current design which has a 100-year design life. Funding was finally secured through the African Development Fund (ADF) of the African Development Bank (ADB), which contributed US$ 65 million as lead lender for the project. The remaining funding was approved for the project by the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction government of Gambia; who state that no contribution was made by Senegal. Approval to proceed was granted by the government of Gambia in 2011.  Construction  Final design and planning work commenced in 2012 and construction began in 2015. Construction was led by a joint-venture of Spanish company Isolux Cors√°n and the Senegalese Arezki Group. The construction contract had a value of 51.7 million euros. The structure is made of reinforced concrete and has a total length of ‚Äì of which the section that crosses the river is long. It has piled foundations but unexpectedly thick layers of mud (up to in depth) on the river banks caused delays in construction. It is one of the longest bridges in West Africa and incorporates a central span to allow for passage of boats along the river. The bridge deck is wide and carries a single-carriageway road. The bridge's official name is a portmanteau of the names of Senegal and Gambia and is intended to reflect the bonds of friendship between the two countries, but it is also known as the Trans-Gambia Bridge. Total project costs were $93 million. A large portion of the workforce were local: 58 % were Gambians and 20 % were from the wider ECOWAS countries. The bridge's opening ceremony took place on 21 January 2019 and was led by Gambia's President Adama Barrow and Senegal's President Macky Sall who made the first official crossing of the bridge together shortly after 4:30 p.m. local time. Gambian Vice President Fatoumata Tambajang, the minister of works Bai Lamin Jobe and his Senegalese counterpart Abdoulaye Daouda Diallo were also in attendance. Zinguinchor mayor Abdoulaye Bald√© and Senegalese national football team coach Aliou Ciss√© were also present and Senegalese musician Youssou Ndour performed music at the opening ceremony. Work to complete the bridge is ongoing, which prevents its opening to anything heavier than a small car. A toll of US$5 is levied for each crossing. Completion of the structure is expected in July 2019. The bridge forms part of a link on the proposed Trans‚ÄìWest African Coastal Highway, part of the Trans-African Highway network. This project, spearheaded by the New Partnership for Africa's Development seeks to link Nouakchott in Mauritania with Lagos in Nigeria via a 15-country, highway in the hope of boosting trade and co-operation in the region.  Post-construction  It is hoped that the road will improve co-operation between Gambia and Senegal and facilitate trade in minerals, fuels and foodstuffs. It has had a marked effect on journey times; a trip by road from Dakar to Ziguinchor which previously took a day can now be completed within five hours. Local ferry operators and roadside vendors have complained about the loss of revenue following construction of the bridge. There is a dispute between the Gambia Ferries Service and the National Roads Authority over which government agency is entitled to the revenue from the bridge. The Ministry of Works, Transport and Infrastructure has negotiated a temporary arrangement whereby the revenue is split between the two. The Gambian press has criticised the government for failing to set up a public‚Äìprivate partnership to ensure tolls fund the future maintenance of the structure.

City of New York, New York, abbreviated NYSRPA v. NYC, was a case addressing whether the gun ownership laws of New York City, which restrict the transport of a licensed firearm out of one's home violated the Constitution's Second Amendment, Commerce Clause, and right to travel. It was the first major gun-related case that the Supreme Court had accepted for review in nearly ten years, after District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) and McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010). After the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, New York City and New York state amended its laws to allay the challenged provision. In a per curiam decision in April 2020, the Supreme Court determined that the case was moot, vacating and remanding the case to lower courts to determine \\"whether petitioners may still add a claim for damages in this lawsuit with respect to New York City's old rule.\\"New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. City of New York, New York, No. 18‚Äì280 (Apr. 27, 2020). Prior to the city's amendments to its laws, the case was seen as a possible vehicle for the Supreme Court's conservative majority to expand gun rights within the United States. In a dissent, Justice Alito, joined by Justices Gorsuch and Thomas, expressed their belief that the New York case was not moot, that the New York law had violated the petitioners' Second Amendment rights, and that Heller had been interpreted too narrowly in the lower courts. Justice Kavanaugh wrote a concurrence but also agreed with Alito's stance the Supreme Court should review the current application of Heller in lower courts.  Background  The Supreme Court's landmark decision in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) affirmed that the Second Amendment protected the right of U.S. citizens to own guns within the privacy of their own home but that sale, possession, and carrying of guns, including specific limitations on weapon types, may be regulated. McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010) affirmed the constitutional right to be incorporated to the states and so prohibited regulations that completely prevented gun ownership. Justice Antonin Scalia, in his majority opinion for Heller, wrote that the Supreme Court was not upholding \\"a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.\\" As a result, a wide variety of state legislation state the types of guns that can be purchased, if a permit and/or license is required before they are owned, if they can be carried in public, and so forth. The gun laws of New York State are generally considered highly restrictive, and New York City's own ordinances on guns are even more restrictive than those on the state level. Other than certain professions in which gun ownership is considered a necessity, gun owners in New York City may possess a gun within their home only under a \\"premises license\\" and the gun must be kept unloaded and in a locked container. Also, gun owners may not transport the guns, except directly to and from one of the city's seven shooting ranges. That includes prohibiting the transport of guns to outside the city limits, even to an external shooting range or to a second residence owned by the gun owner. Prior to 2001, the city offered \\"target licenses\\" that would allow owners to transport their guns to authorized shooting range outside of the city, but the city's police found the licenses to be abused, and the city revoked granting the licenses and altered the language of the premises license to emphasize the restriction on travel. Violations of the ordinance could include up to a year in prison. District court and court of appeals The New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. and several gun owners in New York City filed suit against the City in 2013 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York after affirming with the New York City Police that they could not take their guns in the city out of it to shooting competitions in New Jersey or to homes that they had owned for years.New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass'n v. City of New York, No. 1:13-cv-02115. The plaintiffs argued that the ordinance violated their Second Amendment rights, affirmed by Heller, as well as the Dormant Commerce Clause and the right to travel. The District Court issued summary judgment for the City in 2015 and dismissed the plaintiffs' claims. The ruling found the city to have a compelling interest to limit firearms transport to support public safety and affected gun owners not to have been prevented from traveling out of the city without their guns or to use shooting ranges with guns purchased outside the city. The plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 2015. The Second Circuit affirmed in early 2018. Applying intermediate scrutiny, the Second Circuit held that the law served an important governmental interest, promoting public safety, and that \\"the City has met its burden of showing a substantial fit between the Rule and the City's interest in promoting public safety.\\" The Second Circuit also noted that Heller and McDonald affirmed the constitutional right to own guns only to defend one's home, not for transport or use outside the home. Supreme Court =Grant of certiorari= The plaintiffs petitioned for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court, challenged the Second Circuit's decisions, and specifically asked if the restriction on gun transport violated their Second Amendment rights, their Dormant Commerce Clause rights, and their right to travel. The Supreme Court granted the petition on January 22, 2019. Because of the case, the Supreme Court placed on hold the decision on whether to take Rogers v. Grewal, a New Jersey case involving the right to carry a loaded gun in public. The issue has resulted in a split among the courts of appeal. Until the Supreme Court accepted the New York case in 2019, the Court had denied petitions for certiorari on other gun ownership cases. In one of the more recent denials, issued in February 2018 (during the 2017 term), Justice Clarence Thomas dissented from the denial of certiorari and complained that in his view, \\"the Second Amendment is a disfavored right in this Court.\\" Justice Anthony Kennedy retired in 2018; his opinion on gun rights was generally considered balanced between government and individuals, which made it difficult for the justices to find the necessary majority to take a case. During the 2018 term, Judge Brett Kavanaugh of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit was appointed as Kennedy's replacement and holds conservative views and in previous opinions favored gun ownership. After the Supreme Court granted certiorari, Court observers wrote that--if the Court did not determine that the case was moot--it could be a major case that would settle the question of the standard of review to be applied in Second Amendment cases (i.e., whether gun laws are reviewed under intermediate scrutiny, as the Second Circuit decided, or the more demanding strict scrutiny).How a new Supreme Court case could transform gun rights in America, Economist (January 30, 2019). =Change in city and state law and subsequent mootness briefing= Gun control groups petitioned New York City to change its gun laws prior to the case's decision as to render the case moot, fearing that with a conservative majority, the Court would create case law that would promote wider gun ownership and weaken gun control legislation. In May 2019, the city initiated a public response period to change the gun control regulation, allowing residents with valid gun licenses to be able to transport the weapons to the shooting ranges in the city limits but not outside the city. By the end of June 2019, the city had revised its gun control ordinances to allow licensed gun holders to transport their weapons in a safe manner to homes or shooting ranges outside of the city.Amy Howe, City returns in gun-rights case, SCOTUSblog (July 22, 2019). In filings in July 2019, the city wrote that the issue is moot because of its changes to its law. The city also pointed to a new New York State law, signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo, which allows licensed handgun owners to transport handguns to other places in which they are legally permitted to have them. The New York State Rifle & Pistol Association responded that the case had not been rendered moot and argued that even the changed laws represent a live controversy regarding transport of handguns in New York City. For example, the new regulations allegedly require uninterrupted transportation, which forbids a gun owner from stopping to refuel, and still limit transport outside of the city. The Court continued to instruct all parties to continue to submit filings and briefs prior to the start of the 2019 term. In the first week of the new term in September 2019, the Court considered the mootness of the case in closed conference. The Supreme Court proceedings in the case took place amid the backdrop of a number of high-profile mass shootings took place in the United States, including the shootings at El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio, in August 2019. Sheldon Whitehouse and four other Democratic senators (Kirsten Gillibrand, Mazie Hirono, Richard Blumenthal, and Dick Durbin) filed an amicus brief that strongly urged the Court to find that the case is moot and criticized the Federalist Society and National Rifle Association for promoting what the brief called a \\"project\\" to undermine gun-control laws. Referring to the recent mass shootings, the brief said that \\"In the cloistered confines of this Court, and notwithstanding the public imperatives of these massacres, the NRA and its allies brashly presume, in word and deed, that they have a friendly audience for their 'project.'\\" The senators' brief argued that \\"ignoring neutral justiciability principles to reach desired outcomes\\" would damage the Court's legitimacy as an institution,Brief of Sheldon Whitehouse, Mazie Hirono, Richard Blumenthal, Richard Durbin and Kirsten Gillibrand as Amici Curiae in Support of Respondents, New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass'n, Inc. v. City of New York (No. 18-280). and accelerate a decrease in public faith in the judiciary, and suggested that the Court \\"heal itself before the public demands it be 'restructured in order to reduce the influence of politics.'\\" In its October 7, 2019 orders, the Court denied the request to consider the case moot and stated, \\"The question of mootness will be subject to further consideration at oral argument.\\" =Oral argument= Oral argument were on December 2, 2019. Observers believed from the questions asked that the Court would likely rule the case moot and so not attempt to arrive at a judgement that would extend Second Amendment rights. While the more Conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito seemed to favor expanding gun rights, the liberal side of the Court was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts in asking what was left for the Court to rule on because of the change in the law since certiorari had been granted. =Decision= The court issued a per curiam decision on April 27, 2020, holding that the case was moot in light of the changed law. The Court ordered the prior rulings vacated and the case remanded to lower courts to consider \\"whether petitioners may still add a claim for damages in this lawsuit with respect to New York City's old rule.\\" (This is a challenged issue between the parties: the Supreme Court noted that \\"Petitioners also argue that, even though they have not previously asked for damages with respect to the City's old rule, they still could do so in this lawsuit. Petitioners did not seek damages in their complaint; indeed, the possibility of a damages claim was not raised until well into the litigation in this Court. The City argues that it is too late for petitioners to now add a claim for damages.\\") While the decision was issued per curiam and thus meant to represent the collective decision of the court, reporters inferred the decision was based on a 6-3 vote based on the attached opinions. In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh agreed that the case was moot, but wrote that he agreed with Justice Samuel Alito's \\"concern that some federal and state courts may not be properly applying Heller and McDonald\\" and suggested that \\"The Court should address that issue soon, perhaps in one of the several Second Amendment cases with petitions for certiorari now pending before the Court.\\" The day of the decision, the Court added ten Second Amendment-based petitions for consideration. In a lengthy dissent joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch in full and Justice Clarence Thomas in part, Justice Alito wrote that \\"This case is not moot. The City violated petitioners' Second Amendment right, and we should so hold.\\" He argued that the Court should have evaluated the city's laws in light of Heller and McDonald, and that by rendering the case moot, they have allowed the docket of the Supreme Court to be \\"manipulated\\".

Prior to the attack, he had sent her multiple death threats over social media. As a result of the stabbing, anti-stalking laws in Japan were revised to include online threats to better protect victims. Attack Iwazaki, a fan of Tomita, had sent multiple \\"obsessive comments\\" to her blog and Twitter account. He reportedly sent her some books and a watch. The watch was sent between January and February 2016, and it was returned to the sender in April, after which he sent her around 400 hostile tweets. 12 days before the attack, Tomita had contacted the police at the station near her home in Musashino, Tokyo out of fear for her safety, but the police dismissed the case, believing his social media messages were not an immediate threat. On May 21, 2016, around 5:05 PM JST, Iwazaki confronted Tomita in front of a small concert venue near a train station before an event titled Solid Girls Night Vol. 11 in Koganei, Tokyo, where she was performing later that evening with other singers. Iwazaki had asked her why she returned the gifts he sent her, but stated that he \\"lost control\\" when Tomita did not give him a clear explanation. When Tomita turned around, he stabbed her from behind in chest and neck area 61 times with a pocket knife containing a 8.2 cm blade. Prosecutors alleged that he had yelled, \\"You should die, die, die!\\" as he stabbed her. Eyewitnesses called the police after hearing Tomita scream for help, and Iwazaki was arrested. Iwazaki told the police that he \\"intended to kill\\" Tomita and had prepared a knife beforehand. When Tomita had called the police before being stabbed, the emergency dispatcher had sent the police to her home instead of tracing the location of her cell phone. Tomita was in critical condition but sustained no damage on her vital organs, and she regained consciousness on June 7, 2016. Tomita suffered from 34 stab wounds on her face, neck, back, and arms. She was also partially blinded in her left eye and had problems eating and singing. In addition, Tomita could not use her fingers and it is unknown when she can continue her music career. Tomita also suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. She was released from the hospital in September 2016. On December 17, 2016, Tomita criticized the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department for dismissing her initial concerns. The police issued a formal apology to Tomita for not taking action. Victim is a Japanese singer and actress. In 2011, she starred in Fuji TV's web drama Secret Girls, featuring a group of middle school girls who lead a double life as members of an in-show Japanese idol girl group of the same name. Tomita was cast as Ai \\"Eye\\" Takano and performed as the character along with the rest of Secret Girls at music events. Their self-titled single, \\"Secret Girls\\", was released on March 21, 2012 and charted at #22 on Oricon's Weekly Singles Chart. She also made minor appearances in other films and television shows, such as Kamen Rider Fourze. At the time of the attack, Tomita was also a college student. Perpetrator was 27 years old at the time of stabbing. Iwazaki's older brother described him as \\"unskilled in expressing his emotions\\" but had a \\"gentle, child-like nature.\\" He also mentioned that Iwazaki did not have many known friends. Iwazaki had been a fan of Tomita after watching her shows and had expressed a desire to marry her. Trial =2017 trial= Trials began on February 20, 2017. On the first day of trial, prosecutors read a note from Tomita to the court reading, \\"I want the criminal to die. If you cannot do that, I want him to be locked up for the rest of his life.\\" Iwazaki plead guilty, but his defense team claimed that he had only attacked Tomita out of frustration of her ignoring him, and that he had no intent to kill. Furthermore, they claimed that Iwazaki had tried to contact the police after Tomita was stabbed. Tomita's mother testified on February 21. On February 23, Tomita made her first public appearance since the stabbing and spoke from behind a partition that shielded her from the people in the courtroom. In response to her testimony, Iwazaki shouted, \\"Then you should kill me\\", and, \\"I wasn't actually going to kill you\\", which caused him to be removed from the room. Public prosecutors had proposed Iwazaki to be sentenced to prison for 17 years. On February 28, the court instead sentenced Iwazaki to 14 years and 6 months in prison. =2019 lawsuit= On July 11, 2019, Tomita launched a lawsuit against the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, her former agent, and Iwazaki, seeking in damages for failing to provide adequate protection prior to the stabbing. Impact Tomita's stabbing has led the National Diet to revise their anti- stalking laws in December 2016 to include online harassment, which led to the arrest of 32-year-old Akihiro Fukushima for sending death threats to Nana Mizuki over Twitter. Along with the 2014 incident where AKB48 members were attacked by a man with a saw during their handshake meeting, Tomita's stabbing has been frequently used as an example of stalker-related assaults on Japanese idols. In 2017, animation director Yutaka Yamamoto condemned Iwazaki on his blog, but he also believed Tomita was at fault for rejecting his gifts and should have been prepared to fight back. After receiving backlash for his comments, Yamamoto responded to the criticism by mentioning there was a double standard in the public, where they would care more about a \\"cute idol\\" than a \\"dirty middle-aged man.\\"  References  Category:2016 crimes in Japan Category:Attacks in Japan Category:Stabbing attacks in 2016 Category:Violence against women in Japan ","title":"Stabbing of Mayu Tomita"},{"id":"59753013","title":"Fabi√°n el Gitano"},{"id":"59753016","text":"In late 2018, a series of largely peaceful protests (called Stop Bloody Shirts, ; or One of Five Million, 1 of 5 Million, #1of5million, ) over the rise of political violence and against the authoritarian rule of Serbian President Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá and his governing Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) began to take place in the Serbian capital of Belgrade, soon spreading to cities across the country, as well as in cities with the Serbian diaspora. The demonstrations have lasted more than a year and they become the most prolonged mass anti-government demonstrations in Serbia since the time of the Bulldozer Revolution and some of the longest-running in Europe. The protests were precipitated by an assault on an opposition non-parliamentary politician Borko Stefanoviƒá in November 2018. The protests were also triggered by many scandals of ruling party members, such as sexual harassment at work, assaults on investigative journalists, a plagiarism scandal, the arrest of whistleblower who uncovered the arms trade that allegedly ended up in the hands of ISIS fighters in Yemen, as well as the smear campaign and the unsolved murder of Kosovo Serb opposition leader Oliver Ivanoviƒá. Parallel to the protests, Vuƒçiƒá launched a campaign \\"Future of Serbia\\", organizing rallies in all districts of Serbia, while the pro-government media have constantly demonized protesters and opposition leaders, linking them to fascism as well, spreading misinformation to their readers. Twitter announced that they shut down the network of 8,500 spam accounts that wrote 43 million tweets ‚Äî acted in concert to cheerlead for president Vuƒçiƒá and his party and attack his opponent, including those involved in the protests. The non-partisan expert group formulated the demands of the protests, concluded there were no conditions for free and fair elections, and drafted a comprehensive document with demands and recommendations. The protest resulted in inter-party European Parliament- mediated negotiations, but the largest opposition parties announced a boycott of the coming elections due to lack of press freedom and fair electoral conditions. Since February 2020, protests have continued with more significant involvement of opposition parties with key messages to boycott the election. Protests were suspended in March 2020 over the coronavirus pandemic. Some further and more sporadic gatherings, with heterogeneous demands started in April 2020. Many opposition parties boycotted the elections in June, while less than half the electorate turned out and ruling parties won more than two- thirds of the votes.  Background  Since the 2000 mass unrests that ended Milo≈°eviƒá's rule, major opposition protests had been relatively rare in Serbia. The protests commencing in 2018 have been the third series of such mass demonstrations in three years. The previous series of protests took place in 2017 and were also directed at Vuƒçiƒá and his party, denouncing SNS's perceived domination of the media and voicing concern regarding claims of voter intimidation. The 2016 protests were similarly in part also directed against Vuƒçiƒá. Vuƒçiƒá became Prime Minister after a snap election was called in 2014. He was a longtime member of the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party, leading to fears that he would \\"succumb to the temptations of authoritarianism\\" after his accession to the premiership in 2014. As head of SNS, Vuƒçiƒá however tended to embrace more politically moderate conservative populist and pro-European values, steering government policy toward an eventual entry into the European Union while also maintaining close ties with Russia and China. However, particularly since being elected President in 2017, Vuƒçiƒá had \\"amassed more power, silenced the press, and undermined opposition\\", displaying increasingly authoritarian tendencies. Furthermore, Serbia's press freedom rankings decreased sharply during Vuƒçiƒá's rule, with the European parliament admonishing the government to \\"improve the situation regarding freedom of expression and freedom of the media\\". Serbia is ranked 90th out of 180 countries in the 2019 Press Freedom Index report compiled by Reporters Without Borders, declining its ranking by fourteen if compared to 2018 and 24 places if compared to 2017. In 2018, International Research & Exchanges Board described the situation in the media in Serbia as the worst in recent history, and that Media Sustainability Index dropped because the most polarized media in almost 20 years, an increase in fake news and editorial pressure on media. Freedom House reported that Serbia's status declined from Free to Partly Free due to deterioration in the conduct of elections, continued attempts by the government and allied media outlets to undermine independent journalists through legal harassment and smear campaigns, and Vuƒçiƒá's accumulation of executive powers that conflict with his constitutional role. Observers have described Vuƒçiƒá's rule as authoritarian or autocratic. Data from the Transparency International showed that a significant increase in perceived corruption was seen exactly from 2012, when Vuƒçiƒá came into power. According to research conducted by the Centre for Investigative Journalism, the battle against corruption in practice comes down to media announcements and arrests in front of cameras. During 2017, Oliver Ivanoviƒá, Kosovo Serb opposition politician, was the target of a smear campaign led by Serb List, Serbian Progressive Party and pro-government Serbian media prior local elections. In July 2017, his car was burned down by unknown perpetrators. On 16 January 2018, Ivanoviƒá was shot in a drive-by shooting, while entering his office in North Mitrovica. The protests were prompted by an assault on Borko Stefanoviƒá, one of the leaders of the strongest opposition coalition Alliance for Serbia. Stefanoviƒá was attacked by multiple assailants wielding steel rods on 23 November 2018. Stefanoviƒá, speaking to a New York Times reporter, said he was struck in the head from behind and knocked unconscious, after which the attackers continued battering him with strikes to the head, leading him to conclude the attack was in fact a failed assassination attempt. A day after the attack, Stefanoviƒá displayed his bloodied shirt from the night of the attack at a press conference. The image later became a symbol of the protests, with protesters carrying signs and rallying under the slogan \\"No More Bloody Shirts\\" / \\"Stop the Bloody Shirts\\". Following the assault, members of the opposition asserted that the attackers (multiple suspects were arrested shortly thereafter but denied any involvement) had ties to the ruling party, or that the assault was a result of hateful and vitriolic rhetoric used by the government against its opponents. On 8 December, thousands of protesters had rallied in downtown Belgrade to voice concern about the incident while also condemning the government. On 11 December, the house of investigative journalist Milan Jovanoviƒá was shot up and bombarded with Molotov cocktails. The attack on the journalist (who \\"narrowly escaped\\") further fueled the protests. Jovanoviƒá believes that the attack was related to his reporting on corruption in the municipality. In Belgrade, the crowds have regularly numbered over 10,000, making them the largest in two decades. Protests have taken place on every consecutive Saturday since the initial rally. The protests have been organised by various students and activists, along with the Alliance for Serbia, a loose alliance of various opposition parties and organisations. Prominent leaders of the protests have included actor Branislav Trifunoviƒá, and Jelena Anasonoviƒá, a political science student. Bo≈°ko Obradoviƒá, a hard-right opposition politician, has also emerged as a leading figure of the protests. The political background of protesters and organizers is diverse, with both far-left, liberal, moderate, and far-right nationalist factions voicing opposition to the government. The protests are formally headed by the group Protest Against Dictatorship which also organised similar protests in 2016. The protests have been non-partisan in nature (despite opposition parties providing some logistical support), but some protesters and supporters have voiced consternation over the inefficacy of the political opposition, expressing concern that without a viable electoral outlet, the momentum of the protests will simply fizzle out. Notably, the magazine Foreign Policy argued that demonstrations against Vucic‚Äôs authoritarian government won‚Äôt achieve anything until the opposition can present a coherent alternative. This is a similar concern voiced by experts who argue that Vucic's opposition is too fragmented and its leaders too different to work in unison against Vucic. The survey conducted among the protesters showed that about half of the protesters do not support any political party, but to protest against the suppression of media freedom and corruption. The vast majority of protesters (77%) were made by highly educated citizens and students. = Demands = The protesters have called for greater press freedom, greater political freedom and plurality, electoral reform, new elections, and more government transparency, and condemned what they perceive as Vuƒçiƒá's increasingly authoritarian tendencies (with manifestations including \\"hate speech\\" against opponents, suppression of dissenting voices, and mounting control over the country's media), while also accusing him of creating a climate of fear and violence, and the party he heads of being corrupt. Some protesters and prominent figures also called for Vuƒçiƒá's resignation.

The Commission expressed a serious concern about freedom of expression and that cases of threats, intimidation and violence against journalists are still a concern. = June‚ÄìAugust 2019 = *June, 2019 ‚Äì the protests become some of the longest-running in Europe. *3 June 2019 ‚Äì the expert team concluded there were no conditions for free and fair elections in the country, due to the lack of public communication and inequality in that process, and they drafted a comprehensive and systematic document with six demands and six annexes. *26 August 2019 ‚Äì Sergej Trifunoviƒá, leader of the Movement of Free Citizens and one of the most prominent figures of protests, wrote an open letter to David McAllister, the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, asking him to consider facilitating a cross-party dialogue. = September‚ÄìNovember 2019 = The University of Belgrade's main building was blocked for 12 days by students led by the protest organisers, demanding the final verdict on whether the doctorate of Sini≈°a Mali, the Ministry of Finance, was plagiarised *3 September 2019 ‚Äì the protest organisers called for a boycott of the coming parliamentary election because no recommendation of the expert team was adopted. *16 September 2019 ‚Äì parties of the Alliance for Serbia, the major opposition group, had taken a joint decision to boycott the next elections. *13‚Äì25,= September 2019 ‚Äì students' blockade of the University of Belgrade's main building led by the protest organizers, demanding the final verdict by the University Ethics Committee whetherthe doctorate of Sini≈°a Mali, Ministry of Finance was a plagiarism. *9‚Äì10 October 2019 ‚Äì the first round of inter-party European Parliament-mediated dialogue in Serbia took place, while the Alliance for Serbia refused to participate, stating that there is no time for their demands for fair election conditions to be met before April, when the election is scheduled. *19 October 2019 ‚Äì a protest was held over the arrest of whistleblower who uncovered the arms trade that ended up in the hands of ISIS fighters in Yemen, in which the father of Neboj≈°a Stefanoviƒá, Internal Affairs and Deputy Prime Minister, was involved. *15 November 2019 ‚Äì the second round of inter-party European Parliament-mediated dialogue will once again be boycotted by the Alliance for Serbi–∞.

The EP delegation members announced that conditions for fair and free elections in Serbia have not yet been established. *18 December 2019 ‚Äì the Kru≈°ik whistleblower Aleksandar Obradoviƒá was released from house arrest. = January 2020 = *12 January 2020 ‚Äì authorities said they would reduce the electoral threshold from 5% to 3%. The move has been criticised by numerous observers, opposition parties, the EP delegation members and the Transparency Serbia, stating that this will help some smaller parties enter parliament after the announced boycott of the largest opposition parties. *17 January 2020 ‚Äì Ljubi≈°a Preletaƒçeviƒá, third in the 2017 presidential election, declared a boycott the next parliamentary elections. *28 January 2020 ‚Äì the One of Five million organisation said they would take part in the next elections after advocating boycott for over a year.

The police force used teargas in an attempt to disperse the crowd. = August 2020 = * 8 August 2020 - Global protests were organized in 13 different cities across Europe and the United States. The protestors demanded the following: *# Repeating the 2020 parliamentary elections and for the Constitutional Court to rule them void as per numerous documented electoral frauds. *# Releasing all peaceful protestors who were falsely accused and imprisoned under political influence in the COVID-19 protests and riots in Serbia. *# Resignation of the COVID Crisis Team and forming an independent commission to assess the amount of political influence in making COVID-decisions. They've also supported the \\"United Against Covid\\" petition of over 2,900 Serbian doctors who demanded the resignation of the COVID Crisis Team for their incompetence and allowing themselves to make decisions based on political influence from the ruling party.  Government response  Responding to the protests, Vuƒçiƒá said that he would not compromise with the protesters \\"even if there were 5 million people in the street\\" (prompting protesters to adopt the slogan \\"One of Five Million\\" (\\"#1od5miliona\\")) but saying he would be willing to call a snap election. Both Vuƒçiƒá and his Serbian Progressive Party maintain popularity of over 50% in spite of the protests, and opposition leaders have responded to Vuƒçiƒá's suggestions of an early election by committing to a boycott due to what they describe as \\"unfair conditions. One of the political opposition leaders justified the boycott plans by saying that no election can be considered legitimate until \\"normal conditions for elections and living are created\\". Instead, many of them have called for the institution of a technocratic transitional government which would serve for a period of 1 year after which elections would be held. In an interview in late December, Vuƒçiƒá declared he was ready to discuss the protesters' demands, saying \\"I am ready to look at what causes dissent of the people\\". In late January, Vuƒçiƒá announced the arrest a mayor (and a member of Vuƒçiƒá's SNS party) in connection to the attack on the journalist's home, saying \\"A party membership card will not save anyone from responsibility. Journalists will be protected no matter for whom they work for [sic] ... No one will be protected because of being a politician\\" while also promising a fiercer fight against political violence and cronyism, including legislative actions. After several months of protests, President Vuƒçiƒá and the ruling party members have labelled protesters \\"fascists, hooligans and thieves\\" and accuse them of violence. Goran Vesiƒá, Belgrade‚Äôs Deputy Mayor, linked the protests to the \\"celebration of the day that Adolf Hitler invaded Belgrade\\", as well as alleged support by Ramush Haradinaj, Prime Minister of Kosovo whom Serbia charges of war crimes, with the ultimate goal of overthrowing Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá. = Putin visit = On 17 January 2019, President Vuƒçiƒá received visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin in a \\"lavish welcome\\" and a showing of friendship and mutual support. Tens of thousands of attendants were bused to Belgrade from across Serbia for an event that critics labelled a \\"popularity stunt\\" and a purposeful distraction from the protests. Many of those in the cheering crowd of 100,000 were said to have been \\"offered incentives to attend, including five liters of milk\\", while others were said to have been threatened with firing by bosses should they choose not to attend, according to media reports. It was also speculated that the reception was an attempt by Vuƒçiƒá to placate and shore up support of conservative pro-Russian sections of the population who are concerned about the pro-European tendencies of the President and his government. The ceremony was staged at the same location where, just a day prior, tens of thousands of protesters marched for a candlelight vigil to honour the death of Oliver Ivanoviƒá, a moderate Serb politician that was assassinated in broad daylight in Kosovo in 2018. The vigil was organised by the same groups that were spearheading the ongoing anti-Vuƒçiƒá protests; the unsolved murder had become a \\"rallying point\\" for the protesters, signifying the repressive and sometimes violent political atmosphere of the region.

Early life  Mica√´la Ana Mar√≠a Cousi√±o y Qui√±ones de Le√≥n was born the daughter of Luis Maximiliano Cousi√±o y S√©bire, heir to one of the largest family fortunes of Chile, dating from the 18th century. Her mother was Antonia Qui√±ones de L√©on y Ba√±uelos, 4th Marquesa of San Carlos and Grandee of Spain. The family name Cousi√±o derives from \\"Couto de Liomil\\", a title given as a reward by King Afonso I of Portugal. This name derived as \\"Coutinho\\" in Portugal and \\"Cousi√±o\\" in Galicia.  Career  Mica√´la Cousi√±o started her career on the radio in France. Later, she worked for a press agency - a large advertising group both in Madrid and in Paris.

Secondly, in 1984, she married Henri d'Orl√©ans, Count of Paris having had no offspring from this marriage. Henri d'Orl√©ans, then Count of Clermont, and Mica√´la married civilly in 1984. This marriage was without the consent of Henri's father, then head of the House of Orl√©ans, who initially declared Henri disinherited, substituting the non-dynastic title Comte de Mortain for his son's Clermont countship (the latter once held in appanage by a son of Louis IX of France, who became ancestor of the Bourbon-Orl√©ans line). Henri refused to acknowledge this title, but this act created a lasting division within the Orl√©ans family. Tensions lessened after several years, and on 7 March 1991 the Count of Paris reinstated Henri as heir apparent and Count of Clermont.

The gallery represents and works with artists such as James Turrell, Mary Corse, David Lynch, Tomoharu Murakami, Peter Shire, Rosha Yaghmai, Jiro Takamatsu, Anthony Hernandez, Mika Tajima, Mary Obering, Liza Ryan, Hank Willis Thomas, Llyn Foulkes and Beverly Pepper.  History and gallery space  Created in 2011, the gallery was founded under the creative leadership of Maggie Kayne (daughter of investor Richard Kayne) with the market guidance of Bill Griffin and James Corcoran. Prior to the merger, both Griffin and Corcoran owned their own separate galleries - William Griffin Gallery and James Corcoran Gallery, respectively - both located in Santa Monica, California. Kayne Griffin Corcoran was conceived through a meeting between Griffin, Corcoran, and Kayne (who at the time was a collector and advisor) to discuss a James Turrell Skyspace commission. In a 2019 interview with Griffin and Kayne, the partners expressed that they believe the gallery's programming reflects a spirit of cross-generational collaboration, a shared commitment to Los Angeles culture and history, and dedication to supporting both established and emerging contemporary artists. In 2013, the gallery relocated from Santa Monica to Mid- City West, opening a 15,000 square foot gallery on S La Brea Avenue. In 2014, the building design by Standard Architecture was awarded the World Architecture News award for adaptive reuse. The 1940s bow string truss warehouse was transformed in to a gallery space, while the asphalt parking area was converted to a landscaped forecourt with grass, patios, and a steel trellis covered in creeping fig and flowering Bougainvillea. Inside, the building integrates major permanent installations by artist James Turrell, including skylights along the main gallery and a Skyspace in the conference room.  Exhibitions and artists  Kayne Griffin Corcoran opened its new South La Brea gallery in May 2013 with a historical survey of James Turrell‚Äôs work related to Roden Crater, including drawings, photographs, models, as well as notes, tools, and architectural plans. The gallery has also featured exhibitions of Turrell‚Äôs Glass works, which are wall installations each unique in shape and size incorporating a distinct timed composition of color transitions. As art historian Suzanne Hudson notes in an Artforum review, the works in his 2018 exhibition at the gallery cycle through ‚Äúthousands of hues in subtle, hypnotic metamorphoses‚Ä¶ cast[ing] shadows of chartreuse and orange, magenta and pale blue, biding their time. The gallery‚Äôs first exhibition of works by Mary Corse included The Cold Room, an immersive environment in which a wireless light box hangs in near-freezing temperatures. After first conceiving of the piece in 1968, Corse struggled to find the space and financing for the work, only fully realizing the project years later at Kayne Griffin Corcoran in 2017. Italy-based American artist Beverly Pepper‚Äôs 2017 debut exhibition at Kayne Griffin Corcoran was also her first major solo exhibition in Los Angeles. The exhibition featured works spanning her nearly 60-year career, including large scale Cor-ten steel sculptural works, along with smaller sculptures made of stone and Carrara marble. As KCRW Art Talk critic Edward Goldman describes, the exhibition ‚Äúwas a rare combination of brutality and elegance, machismo and grace‚Ä¶ [Pepper‚Äôs] sculptures, with their minimalistic geometric forms, have an unexpectedly theatrical effect.‚Äù External links *  References  Category:2011 establishments in California Category:Art galleries established in 2011 Category:Art galleries in Los Angeles ","title":"Kayne Griffin Corcoran"},{"id":"59753265","text":"Rainbow People is an album by trombonist Steve Turre recorded in 2007 and released on the HighNote label the following year.Jazz Depot: HighNote discography accessed January 23, 2019Steve Trurre: album details website accessed January 23, 2019 Reception The AllMusic review by Thom Jurek said the album \\"may be the finest offering of his career as a leader\\" and noted \\"his compositions here are startlingly fresh, wildly and cleverly inventive, and full of warmth and humor.

Despite a late start to her career (she did not start painting until age 42), she became one of Thailand's leading artists.  Early life  Born in Thailand in 1906, Misiem Yipintsoi was the daughter of ethnic Chinese- Indonesian parents.Fry, Gerald W., Nieminen, Gayla S., Smith, Harold E. \\"Historical Dictionary of Thailand\\" pg. 252 She was educated at the Assumption Convent School in Bangkok.Rama IX Art Foundation She married shortly after completing her education, and raised five children.Misiem's Sculpture Garden  Artistic awakening  Yipintsoi had no formal training in art, but her interest in painting was piqued during a long stay in Denmark (where she spent 14 months while one of her children was being treated for polio). While in Denmark, she viewed many paintings, both in museums and the homes of friends, and purchased many paintings to decorate her home in Thailand. After returning to Thailand, she began studying painting at the age of 42 with Monet Satomi, a Japanese cultural attache to Thailand.  Artistic career  Not long after she began studying painting, Yipintsoi submitted her painting 'Santikam' to Thailand's first National Exhibition of Art in 1949. She won a gold medal, and proceeded to win gold medals in the next two years as well for her paintings 'Honolulu' and 'Sriracha'. Though no longer eligible to compete afterwards, she continued to exhibit in the National Exhibition of Art annually through 1979.Misiem's Sculpture Garden Yipintsoi later studied sculpture under the acclaimed Italian-Thai artist Silpa Bhirasri. After her death, Silpakorn University established a sculpture garden with many of her pieces. Other sculptures are collected in the Misiem Sculpture Museum in Nakhon Pathom province; her last sculpture, 'Coy Girl', unfinished at the time of her death, was stolen from that museum in 2015.\\"Police seeking stolen Misiem Yipintsoi sculpture\\"  Honors and legacy  Yipintsoi was awarded the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1984 by the French Ministry of Culture, one of the first three Thais to receive the award.\\"A French 'merci' for Dhipavadee\\", The Nation, 25 Mar 2007 Silpakorn University awarded her an honorary Doctor of Arts degree in 1985.

It presented the two separated and spaced places, as on the Ca.14 (while on Ca.15 they were very close and accessible through a single opening at the top of fuselage). On Ca.16 it was possible for the first pilot to arm or disengage the commands of the second pilot (or passenger). Operational use =Closed-circuit records= The operational history of Caproni Ca.16 is largely linked to the figure of the pilot Russian Chariton Nikanoroviƒç Slavorossov. He had presented himself to Vizzola Ticino, where at that time the workshops of Caproni and Faccanoni were located, in January 1913, to buy a propeller for his Bl√©riot. Caproni already knew the skills of this pilot, who had seen flying to Vienna in 1912. He offered him a pilot test place, which Slavorossov accepted. On 24 January, on board a Ca.16, he beat the world record on a closed circuit of 5 km with passenger, covering 200 km in 1 h 56 '30 and 250 km in 2 h 24' 30. Slavrosoff arrives at Rome. =The Milan-Rome raid= On 23 February 1913, with the intention (colored in tones patriotic, or even nationalistic) to give an impulse to the Italian aeronautic industry, the vice president of the Italian aviation company Luigi Origoni and the general secretary of the Italian Touring Club and collaborator of the La Gazzetta dello Sport Arturo Mercanti decided to give away a prize for the first flight from Milan to Rome made with an Italian aircraft.

Design The Ca.6 was a single-engine propeller- driven biplane with a traditional configuration with wings in the bow and tail fletching, but it had no fuselage : it was replaced by a light structure formed by two beams of unshelled wood and some vertical reinforcing uprights that supported the planes of tail. They were composed only of a stabilizer - horizontal balancer; the lack of a vertical drift was compensated by four large interwoven surfaces that, placed between the wings, contributed to the stability of the aircraft around the vertical axis. The wings resumed the double curvature profile that had also characterized Caproni aircraft immediately preceding, but with not very lucky results: the aerodynamic characteristics of this type of profile, which had been suggested to Caproni by his friend and colleague Henri CoandƒÉ, proved to be once again unsatisfactory. Preservation The Caproni Ca.6 was preserved inside the Caproni workshops until 1934, when it was brought to Milan to be shown to the public on the occasion of the Italian Air Force Exhibition; in the meantime, in 1927, the spouses Gianni and Timina Caproni founded the Caproni Museum, in whose headquarters in Taliedo the Ca.6 found a place starting from the forties .

The fuselage was composed of a wooden trellis, reinforced by tie rods in a metal cable and with metal joints in turn; its front part, between the engine and the trailing edge of the wing, was covered with canvas, while the rest was uncovered. The wing, with an appreciable angle of dihedral, had in turn a wooden structure covered with canvas; it had no ailerons, and the roll control depended on a wing warping system; the deformation of the wing ends to guarantee warping was made by some tie rods which, like the bracing cables which reinforced the wing itself, were fixed to the top of a pyramidal structure located above and in front of the uncovered pilot station. The empennages consisted of a horizontal plane placed under the fuselage and an entirely movable vertical plane hinged to the rear end of the fuselage itself. The landing gear consisted of a pair of spoked wheels placed under the front of the aircraft, to the supporting structure of which were also linked two wooden skids in anti-rollover function, and a tail skid arranged between the trailing edge of the wing and the leading edge of the horizontal tail plane. The powertrain consisted of a fanless 3-cylinder Anzani engine with 25 hp and a fixed pitch wooden two - blade propeller, placed at the top of the aircraft in a trailing position.

In fact, the wing was in three pieces and was anteriorly hinged on the front side member which served as a rotation axis for the same; the variation of incidence of the wing was commanded by a handwheel that commanded a helical tube that acted on the rear pylon. Moreover, with a system of tie-rods, the rear planes of the tail were controlled so as to compensate for the variations in pressure exerted on the wing, maintaining the longitudinal equilibrium of the optimal aircraft. The Ca.22 in 1913 obtained various world records of height and ascent.Gianni Caproni, Caproni Airplanes - studies, projects, projects from 1908 to 1935 (Ed.

Design The Caproni Ca.11 was a high wing monoplane with a wooden structure and a canvas covering, equipped with a wing warping system to control the roll and reinforced by metal tie rods connected to the fuselage and to a special structure placed above it; the fuselage was based on a wooden lattice structure, in turn reinforced by metal cables, and was covered in cloth only for the front half; the same wooden structure with a canvas covering characterized the empennages. The trolley, fixed, was composed of two front wheels with anti-overblank pads and another smaller, tailed shoe. The Ca.11 differed from its immediate predecessors mainly for the engine, a French -made 7- cylinder star- shaped Gnome capable of developing a power of 50 hp. Operational use The Ca.11 was a single-seater designed for training and for experimental military applications. The quality of the project and the construction, however, allowed the model to report several notable successes, with a series of speed records beaten in February 1912. On 12 February, under the control of the pilot Enrico Cobioni, who had obtained his own flight license at the Caproni aviation school in Vizzola Ticino, a Ca.11 traveled 20 times, turning around in a circle, a closed circuit of 5 km, for a total of 100 km, in 66 min 30 s, thus establishing a new Italian record for the 100 km circuit (average speed of 90.225 km / h ) [4] for the 5 km in circuit (average speed of 91.370 km / h, corresponding to a time of 3 min 17 s); the record was approved by the commissioners Augusto Vogel and Gustavo Moreno.Giovanni Celoria, Three years of aviation on the moor of Somma Lombardo (5 April 1910 - 5 April 1913), Milan, Stab.

Meany in background Mount Queets is a mountain summit located deep within Olympic National Park in Jefferson County of Washington state. With a good eye and clear weather, the top of the mountain can be seen from the visitor center at Hurricane Ridge. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Meany (6,695 ft), to the south. Due to heavy winter snowfalls, Mount Queets supports the Queets Glacier in a cirque on its north slope, despite its modest elevation. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into the headwaters of both the Elwha River and Queets River. There are scrambling routes ranging from class YDS 2 via the North Ridge, class 3 via the ridge from Mt. Meany, and class 4 via the Queets Glacier. History The present day Mt. Meany - Mt. Queets area was referred to as Mt. Mesachie on the 1896 Gilman National Geographic Map. The word mesachie is from Chinook Jargon and means wicked. The mountain was dubbed \\"Mt. Hearst\\" during the 1889-90 Seattle Press Expedition to honor William Randolph Hearst, owner of the San Francisco Examiner, but Mount Queets is the officially accepted name today. The name \\"Queets\\" first appeared on the Surveyor General's map of Washington Territory referring to the Queets River, then was later applied to the glacier on the mountain which is the primary source of the river. The word \\"Queets\\" is a derivation of the name of the Quai'tso (Queets) tribe. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1890 by Harry Fisher (aka James B. Hanmore) and Nelson Linsley during the second O‚ÄôNeil Expedition. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Queets is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. In terms of favorable weather, the best months for climbing are June through September.

Biography  Gagliardi was born in Rome on 9 August 1809 to Francesco (of Campania) and Angela Zucchi (of Rome). He studied architecture under Professor Francesco Lanci, but after the death of his brother Giovanni, a painter, he directed his attentions to painting. He studied in the Accademia di San Luca, including under such masters as Tommaso Minardi. He partook in school competitions, winning second place in 1827 and the medal of encouragement in 1828. Church of Sant'Eustachio in Romealt=Painting of the Holy Family by Pietro Gagliardi He worked primarily in Rome, and his studio was located in Palazzo Giustiniani in Piazza San Luigi dei Francesi. His first major commission dates to 1834, when he decorated the chapel of San Sebastiano in Villa Aldobrandini in Frascati for Prince Francesco Borghese Aldobrandini. By the 1840s, he had established himself as a preeminent painter of sacred art and was active in and around Rome, especially in Tarquinia, where he worked with his nephews Francesco and Giovanni. In 1847, he worked on the completion of the fresco decorations in the Church of San Girolamo dei Croati in Rome. He continued his painting, often depicting mythological and historical themes, in other elegant residences, such as Villa Torlonia in Castel Gondolfo (in 1841); Palazzo Torlonia in Piazza Venezia (in 1842); the new section of the Casino dell'Aurora in the Palazzo Pallavicini-Rospigliosi, which was commissioned by the Prince of Piombino Antonio Boncompagni Ludovisi (from 1855 to 1858); and Palazzo Sangermano-Rappini in Arpino (in 1871).

Life and career  Stanly was the illegitimate son of privateer John Wright Stanly and half- brother to U.S. Congressman John Stanly. He became known as one of the largest slave owners in North Carolina and the wealthiest free back resident. Even though he himself was born a slave, Stanly had used his intelligence and family ties to become a successful entrepreneur, land developer, and plantation owner. In fact, Stanly \\"became not only the largest slave owner in Craven County, and one of the largest in North Carolina, but he owned more than twice as many slaves as the second largest free Negro slave owner in the South.\\" He was a key member of this prominent mixed-race family in New Bern, North Carolina which included his grand-daughter, Sara G. Stanley, who would eventually become one of the first African-American women to attend Oberlin College in Ohio, and John Patterson Green, his great-nephew, who is known as the ‚ÄúFather of Labor Day‚Äù.  Personal Life  John C. Stanly‚Äôs father, John Wright Stanly, was a renowned gambler, counterfeiter, and eventually a licensed privateer who made his riches during the American Revolutionary War by stealing property from the English. John C. Stanly‚Äôs mother was an Ebo slave, who was born off the West Coast of Africa, in the region of Nigeria, and brought to America on a ship owned by John Wright Stanly. Because of the status of his African-American mother, Stanly was born a slave. However, unlike many other children born under similar circumstances, his father acknowledged him as a relation in their community of New Bern. Upon his father's death, Stanly inherited some money, but not his freedom. His ownership at some point was transferred over to his father‚Äôs neighbor and business partner, Alexander Stewart, who captained the ship that brought Stanly's mother from Africa, and his wife Lydia. It is often incorrectly claimed that he was manumitted by the General Assembly of North Carolina in 1808. However, he was actually manumitted thirteen years earlier at age 21 in 1795 by his owners and, by then, adopted by the Stewart family. The controversy is probably the result of Stanly's dissatisfaction at simply being freed and wishing to be declared free, which was a different legal status. During this era, the freedom of black people was constantly changing and ambiguous. To establish legal clarity to protect his growing family wealth, Stanly petitioned the General Assembly multiple times to confirm him and his sons' \\"emancipated and set freed\\" with \\"all the rights and privileges of free persons of mixed blood\\". Stanly used the state's court system many times. He resolved disputes, served as an estate's trustee multiple times, and registered many written agreements with white people with the court. He was known as someone who would stand his ground and fought to maintain ownership over his family's property and had a reputation for fairness. Over the course of his life, he formed close relationships with a few notable prominent white community members, including Lydia Stewart and the lawyer-politician John H. Bryan; but most notable was his relationship with his half-brother, John Stanly Jr. Born the same year as John C., both brothers appear to have maintained an unusually long-lasting close personal and business relationship over many years.  Business Life  One of the few business opportunities for freed slaves was becoming a barber. Before he was released from their care, the Stewarts made sure Stanly was educated and trained as a barber so he could support himself. Historian Loren Schweninger, who wrote an extensive article about Stanly's career, described when Stanly was hired out as an apprentice barber, he was considered \\"intelligent, quick-minded, and hardworking.\\" After he received his freedom and small inheritance, Stanly opened his own barber shop that catered to the wealthy white business people and politicians who were friends of his well-known family. He was popularly known as ‚ÄúBarber Jack.‚Äù Stephen F. Miller, a local lawyer, described Stanly at the time as \\"a man of dignified presence\\" of whom \\"no citizen of Newbern would hesitate to walk the streets with him.\\" Although Stanly's barbershop was very successful, providing haircuts were not that profitable. Stanly began amassing his wealth primarily by \\"discounting bank notes\\"; basically he loaned money to white people who, for a variety of reasons, did not want the stigma of getting a loan from a bank. New Bern was an important trading center receiving ships filled with raw goods from the Caribbean and manufactured items from New England, Europe, and Africa. Because of its prime location and his unique cultural circumstances, Stanly was able to weather the economic ups and downs in the post-American Revolutionary Era, including a severe outbreak of yellow fever in the 1790s. Owning the only barbering facilities in town eventually allowed Stanly to hire two slave apprentices, known as Brister and Boston, to run his shop while he began to occupy his time buying parcels of real estate both in town and in the rural surrounding communities around 1798. His first purchase of property was from William Berry, a white man, for only thirty shillings. However, over the next several years, he paid an increasing amount for properties that soon ran from the hundreds to the thousands of dollars. Schweninger noted that Stanly attended auctions to buy land that was confiscated by the county because of back taxes which were owed. By his early thirties, he had a reputation for being a sharp businessman with \\"significant property holdings\\". He not only bought property, but when he saw he could make a profit, he would sell it. Stanly used his revenues to purchase freedom for family members and free others close to him, including his wife and five children. He also rented houses, had income from cotton sales, and attended chattel sales like his white neighbors to purchase slaves. According to Schweninger, state records report that Stanly owned 127 slaves by 1820. These people did a myriad amount of work including working at his barber shop and on his two plantations on Bachelor's Creek along the Neuse River. He loaned out the labor of his slaves for a profit in addition to making money manufacturing and exporting turpentine. Stanly spent a considerable amount of time and money buying and then freeing family members, for example his brother-in-law John Merrick and several slaves owned by familiar white families like the Stewarts. He also took dozens of underage slaves under his guardianship, providing them with jobs and places to live; however, Schweninger was clear to state that \\"Stanly rose to a position of wealth and prestige through his ownership and use of slave laborers.\\" On one of his properties, Hope Plantation, Stanly hired three white overseers. She also notes that \\"Stanly differed little from his white neighbors\\" in his treatment of his slaves. His male slaves were worth twice that of his female slaves, so maintaining families would have been difficult, and Schweninger's research determined that Stanly was not averse to selling his slaves' family members. By the 1850s, Stanly had amassed property worth approximately $21,200 which \\"would have placed him in the top one half of one percent among white men\\" in the South and the nation. Schweninger believed part of his ascendancy was in no small part to his \\"amicable and close relations with Craven County white [people].\\" (184) After the Denmark Vessey slave uprising scandal in 1822, southern legislatures enacted new restrictions and controls on slaves and freed blacks. However, Stanly's wealth and family connections isolated him from many of these changes. Schweninger also explained that when Stanly \\"felt he [was] being treated unfairly, Stanly was not [averse] to using the court system to defend his rights as a property owner.\\" = Family Life = One of the first people Stanly bought out of slavery was his wife Kitty, who was a member of the Green family, another prominent mixed-race family in New Bern born into slavery. According to North Carolina marriage records, John legally married Kitty Green on March 26, 1805. Their marriage was properly witnessed and bonded by the white bondsman, Marcus C. Stephen, for the purpose of again petitioning the State General Assembly in order to establish that his family had \\"all the rights and privileges of freedom, as though they and each of them had been born free\\". They had nine children together, among whom were Charles Stewart Stanly, John Florence Stanly, Kitty (Catherine) Green Stanly, Eunice Carruthers Stanly, and Alexander Stewart Stanly, and educator John Stuart (Stewart) Stanley, who changed the spelling of his middle name and added the original \\"e\\" back to his last name that his grandfather removed for unknown reasons. John S. Stanley was also the father of Sara G. Stanley and Stanly gave her the middle name from his Stanly adopted family. Together, John and Kitty became one of the founding families who established the First Presbyterian Church in New Bern in 1817. In the church registry, Kitty is named specifically as one of the thirteen people who gave funds to Scottish craftsman Robert Hay, who built and designed the church; which is still active in its community today. They would attend this church every Sunday and sit in one of two pews they owned. Stanly used his and Kitty's family connections to pass on and share deeds of property to such a degree that Schweninger declared Stanly as \\"the head of a black family and kinship network that included some of the most prominent whites and industrious slaves and free black[s] in Craven County.\\" Sometime in the 1820s Stanly's wife Kitty came down with an unknown illness that caused her to suffer for many years. When he emancipated two of his wife's caretakers, he wrote in their papers that Kitty was \\"unable to render to herself any assistance\\" and was \\"dependent during all said time on the kindness of [nurses Nancy and Money].\\" After as long as possibly ten years of \\"arduous and menial\\" work, Stanly freed these women upon the death of his wife. During the same time of his wife's illness, Stanly came to the aid of his half-brother when he became financially exposed due to his own negligence. In the late 1820s, as president of the Bank of New Bern, John Stanly Jr. \\"failed to call loans in on time, overextended the bank's note issue, and used bank funds to buy and sell stock subscriptions, discount notes, and cotton.\\" During this time, perhaps from the strain, John Stanly Jr. suffered a paralytic stroke. Schweninger believed out of \\"a sense of personal loyalty,\\" Stanly countersigned a \\"security bond\\" for his half brother for the amount of $14,962, a considerable amount of money at the time, offering \\"as collateral a large portion of his estate.\\" This overextended John Stanly Jr. and \\"with a few strokes of his pen, he was forced to jeopardize the acquisitions of a lifetime.\\" The bank eventually was forced to close and Stanly lost much of the contributions, forcing him to sell several of his properties including many slaves. The national depression of the 1830s compounded his financial losses; however, even into his sixties, he provided funds toward emancipating slaves while at the same time maintaining slavery on his properties.  Death  By the time Stanly had entered his seventies, he was only able to hold on to a few tracts of land on which he ran a small plantation composed of seven slaves. However, upon his death in 1846, his reputation remained as high as ever. He was considered by many of his white neighbors to be no different from them.

The player controls a team who, after surviving a helicopter crash at an arctic base, must scrounge for supplies. It is available for Microsoft Windows, iOS, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.  Gameplay  The gameplay is inspired by The Thing, a 1982 horror film by John Carpenter. After a helicopter crash, the survivors take refuge at an abandoned arctic base. Initially, players choose two out of a roster of three characters. The roster can be expanded by unlocking up to fifteen characters, each of whom have special abilities to aid in their survival. The base's map is randomly generated. While scrounging for supplies, the characters must satisfy basic needs: sleep, heat, and hunger. Sleeping risks drawing the attention of aliens known as \\"anomalies\\", which can kill characters or set back progress. Failure to satisfy their needs can cause madness, which brings on random status effects, such as quoting Shakespeare or consuming more food. After solving a randomized puzzle, players unlock a new zone, and another random map is generated. The game concludes once six zones have been completed.  Release  Distrust was released on August 23, 2017.  Reception  On Metacritic, the PC version of Distrust has a rating of 75/100 based on five reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Leif Johnson of GameSpot rated it 7/10 stars and wrote that the game's roguelike gameplay, which depends heavily on random chance, keeps replays fresh. However, he said this randomization can also make it \\"maddeningly tough\\". Ted Hentschke of Dread Central rated it 2.5/5 stars, criticizing how little inspiration the game took from The Thing, its trivially-overcome challenges, and the pointlessness of many of the randomized gameplay elements. Reviewing the game for Bloody Disgusting, Jim Hargreaves rated it 3/5 stars and wrote that the game's unpredictability and rushed micromanagement may frustrate some players, who find themselves overwhelmed.

Roger of Montgomery refounded the abbey sometime between 1063-1066. History During the Anglo-Norman civil war, upon hearing the abbey was being used by Duke Robert Curthose as a stable, Robert of Bell√™me burned it down. The abbess, Bell√™me's sister Emma, fled with her sister nuns and were housed in surrounding homes or at the monastery of St. Evroul. The following year Emma had the abbey rebuilt. Consequently, the abbey would suffer another fire under Abbess Matilda, Emma's successor. Episcopal visit In 1260, Archbishop Eudes Rigaud noted the refectory was not in use; the nuns ate in groups of twos and threes in private rooms.
